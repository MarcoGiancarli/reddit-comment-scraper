I believe (men, confirm for me here?) that the best way is to make sure you're warm & soft, like right after a hot shower.  Stand with your legs slightly spread and essentially pull the skin of the scrotum against the testicle, using that as your shaving surface.

Stand with your legs slightly spread and essentially pull the skin of the scrotum against the testicle, using that as your shaving surface.   No need to shower before the shaving, old Barber said beard hair needs 3 minutes to get saturated, my experience says that you don't need to satiate the hair at all. Bit of warm water and a splash of baby oil and you are ready to bring the razor. That being said, the first time you shave the hair is long, so satiated hair is less of a bother, still, use baby oil instead of shaving cream (old trick I've learned from Reddit). Stretching the skin is the most important part, an erection is actually very helpful while shaving the shaft, that also keeps the dick away from the work area when shaving the balls. The second most important part is that you never ever move the razor sideways. Forwards and backwards as much as you like, that also removes the hair from between the blades. The scrotum and shaft where the skin is thin and very very flexible you can go against the hair growth without problems, around those areas that will result in ingrown hair and itchy skin. I prefer an electrical beard trimmer for the areas around the Penis and balls, that removes the possibility of ingrown hair completely, but be careful a beardtrimmer combined with the soft skin of the scrotum can lead to some unpleasant memories.

It would get worse in winter, when it was cold - if I sat without stretching my legs or cracking my knees for too long, like in a movie theatre, my knees would begin to ache and it would just get worse and worse until I cracked them. I couldn't walk down stairs without pain and sometimes it would hurt to bend my knees enough to sit on the toilet or tie my shoes.   I saw a physiotherapist/massage therapist at work who basically said that some muscle was too weak and made my knees buckle in or something. Basically when I started running regularly my legs got stronger and the pain largely subsided, but was still there. I then decided to try out a low carb/keto diet (for general health reasons, not knees or weight loss). One unexpected side effect was that my knees seemed to feel even better. Eventually it was good enough to the point where I was able to go to the gym and do squats and deadlifts, which made my legs even stronger and made the pain go away further. Now I am still careful with some exercises like lunges, but can do pretty much anything with very little to no knee pain - even tie my shoes."

But we have the right to be shallow people.  I suggest you don't tell people you aren't his friend or dating him because he is ugly. Some people may say that it's understandable because it may say something about someone if they are not putting in effort to make themselves look better. It's kinda like it doesn't matter how big or small you are if your clothing is fitted in the right way you can look super fly. And you may value you that more than others. In my opinion if you actually wanted to be his friend for a genuine reason you wouldn't be thinking about his looks or you would want to help him make himself look more put together not consider not being his friend and letting him stay in a state that you think makes him be represented poorly.  Personally I see beauty in everyone. Society does judge based on appearances. There is evidence of it all over. Society also likes to believe it's morally wrong to judge someone based on looks.

Society will view making decisions on looks as badly if you say it aloud because morally we were taught it's what matters on the inside. But we all do it. We just shouldn't talk about it. Also saying someone's ugly in general isn't nice. But if you like someone sexually or as a friend but they have bad teeth and a neck beard and you don't want your friends judging you for dating or being friends with a guy with bad teeth and a neck beard that's bad.  If you are looking for a sexual partner and not want someone that you find ugly that is understandable.

I thought this was /r/findareddit  For me I would not center justify the introduction section or bullet the skills block that is in 3 columns.   Also as for tailoring a varied work history, you really should try to see what job you are applying for and try to pick certain aspects of your old jobs that would best carry over. For example a sales job should highlight any customer interactions. A technical job should demonstrate instances where you solved a problem.   I try not to critique design too much because everyone has their own opinions (ask 5 people and you'll get 6 designs), but I'll reiterate that I really think center justify a paragraph is not professional. A heading can be, but any block of text should be all left (preferred) or right (if it is a design you're looking for).    Edit 2 (on mobile so I've gotta go back and forth) - gaps in your resume don't need to be highlighted necessarily. I have ""gaps"" that had irrelevant part time work.   With a resume you try to highlight skills you can bring to their company. Any explanations for gaps can be filled in on a cover letter or in an interview.   The answer you can give during an interview is just what you wrote, took care of a relative. The best answer you can give (if it's true) was that you also worked on &lt;insert certification here>.   Another minor style critique: if word auto-hyperlinks text (email), make sure you remove it (or if you submit a pdf make the text black and not underlined).   Edit 3 - MS office has changed a bit since '07. It's not a huge change in my opinion, but saying you know office 03-07 makes me think you aren't up to date with 2013 (you're missing 2010 as well). Just drop the dates/editions.   Also, in my field (engineering and comp sci) I feel knowing PowerPoint, word, and excel is not highlight worthy. But if you know access that would be a plus."

The thing is, you probably don't know how racist you sound.    I'm not racist, I'm just curious.     Ok   I have a racist friend and a lot of points he has (though narrow minded) are true to the extent of the black communities I've come to know.     So you're not a racist, but you agree with your openly racist friend about black people?   I'm going to try and go line by line here.    Watching black comedies or talj shows or even serious talk, it seems the black community enjoys being the stereotype they fight against.     What sterrotype is that exactly? Who is fighting against it?    Intellectual black individuals are even persecuted by thier own community.    Can you give some examples? Maybe you're going to say how being smart in a predominantly black school will get you bullied. Isn't that true for most schools? Nerds vs Jocks? I'm not saying that it's right, but it's definitely not race specific. And the thing is, it may seem more pronounced among black people, but it's really more prevalent among the lower class, where education isn't valued as much, regardless of race.    Talk shows with black hosts make racist jokes about themselves and other people with no consequence,     This is like how fat people can make jokes about them being fat, but you can't.    have thier own Black TV network where even the shoes and movies depict a world of nothing but black people and the few white ones are either stupid, douches or in some dead end job.     Can you name any mainstream television show outside of the BET that has majority Black representation? How many shows are predominantly white? The vast majority, would you say? BET exists to fill a hole that is unaddressed by the rest od television. How would you feel if every TV show was nothing but women, even when it didn't make sense? As long as television/movies panders to white people, black people will need something like the BET.    On top of that they pull the race card for anything and everything     They. Who is they? All black people? Most black people? You're lumping millions upon millions of people into one single caricature here. Who are you to say they like black people are a species, with predictable behavior patterns? That's very racist.   In top of that, there's the concept of the race card. As if black people are constantly going through life, punching through obstacles with their skin color while whitey is stuck in the dust. That's bullshit. Racism is still very much a reality, and just because someone isn't afraid to call it out when they see it doesn't mean that they're ""playing the race card.""   Hopefully that was an acceptable explanation. I'm coming from the perspective of a white male dating a black girl, so I'm probably wrong on a few points.

TooAfraidToAsk,3ctulh,someguynamedjohn13,10,Mon Jul 13 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"There's a few things at play here. First is economic state: even with the abolishment of slavery black people in America have gotten the short end of the stick. That formed a vicious cycle: black people are oppressed in society because they can't advance themselves socio-economically; they can't advance themselves socio-economically because their still systematically oppressed. (Obviously, this doesn't apply to all black people, I'm mainly focusing on the plight of lower/poverty classes, which can also apply to other minority groups and even white people.) The other part is pride: in my opinion, everyone has the right to be proud of something. But, when you don't have a lot going for you, especially in a capitalist society, it's hard to have something good to be proud of. So instead of doing what you're proud of, people are proud of what they do, and when you have to take extreme measures just to make ends meet, you become proud of stuff that isn't the best to be proud of. That's how you get the glorification or violence, crime, etc. They have to do it, but at least their doing something.   The next part, about the black comedians/talk shows talking lightly about it. That's just their job: observe what's going on and comment on it. It's commentary. The reason they talk about it is because it's happening and it's prominent in their community. And by talking about it, they're also bringing awareness about these situations in a way that's not antagonizing to the listener/viewer: by incorporating humour.  But the biggest problem is that it's not fixing the problem. Because the economy depends on everyone, and putting together resources in order to help the lowest level of society sounds a lot like ""socialism"" and isn't going to take hold in America any time soon.  But I'm not a sociologist or anything."

As others have, I suggest you speak to a therapist if the memory of that experience continues to haunt you."
TooAfraidToAsk,3ct9pt,cmillard12,8,Fri Jul 10 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to say that I'm so sorry these things happened to you.    You didn't mention your age, your assailant's age, or any details about how you knew each other.  I'm going to assume that you're both legal adults.  If one or both of you was a minor, if alcohol or drugs were involved, or if he had power over you in some way (like a boss or a teacher), then his actions would be considered more serious.  The first incident was disrespectful and abusive.  No one deserves to be pressured, emotionally manipulated, or guilted into sex.  You have every right to be angry on the basis of this incident alone.    The second incident is most definitely sexual assault  (the specific legal definitions of rape and sexual assault vary somewhat, so whether this is legally 'rape' or 'sexual assault' will depend on where you live).  Consent for one sex act does not imply consent for other acts.  Consent can also be withdrawn at any time.  You are by no means ""taking things out of proportion"".  You have every right to be angry.  The fact he apologized (after you asked him to) is a little good, I guess, but it doesn't change the facts.  You have every right to file a police report.    The reality is that rape can be difficult to prosecute, even when physical evidence can be collected (generally only done immediately after the assault).  Rapists rely on their victims feeling confused or embarassed to decrease the likelihood they will be caught and punished.  Unfortunately, many rape victims say that reporting the crime to the police was a very negative and upsetting experience.  On the other hand, many victims say that reporting the crime made them feel more empowered because it helped them to protect future victims and show the assailant how serious his actions are.  Only you can decide whether you want to report the crime or not.    Telling his current girlfriend may protect her from being victimized the way that you were.  The current girlfriend may not believe you or may claim you're just jealous.  That could be very hurtful and it's a risk you don't have to take.  It's not your responsibility to speak up, but it would be a public service if you did.  An alternative solution might be to tell any friends of yours that are also friends with the gf.  She might take the news better from someone else.    I strongly recommend you talk about your situation with  a rape crisis counselor.  They are trained to guide you to resources in the community that may be helpful.  They can also answer questions about any legal or medical actions you might want to take.  They can also just talk with you about the experience, how you feel, and what you want to do.  You can find services in your local phone book, or you can contact the RAINN online hotline.  Source: I'm a licensed psychologist.  Good luck and I would be happy to answer any other questions you might have."

Someone telling him ""that was not acceptable and not okay, I said stop and no, don't act like a pouty child trying to manipulate me into doing something I don't want to do.""  Talk to the new girlfriend and tell her that he crossed the line with you and it is something that caused you some trauma and that she should not let him treat her that way if he is and he needs to learn what is okay and what is not okay.

It uses a scale from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the Male and Female volumes of the Kinsey Reports, an additional grade, listed as ""X"", was used to mean ""no socio-sexual contacts or reactions""; in modern times, this represents asexuality.   The reports were first published in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953).

TooAfraidToAsk,3cmako,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"That thing is so dangerous... most people seem to immediately assume that a scale existing must imply an equal or normal distribution above it. (Edit: Depictions like the bot posted don't exactly help.) Example:   Alfred C. Kinsey conducted research on human sexuality in the late 1940s and early 1950s and published his findings in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (Kinsey, 1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953). Kinsey ranked his findings on a seven-point scale with exclusive heterosexuality at zero and exclusive homosexuality at six. (Kinsey, 1948, p. 638) Among twenty-five–year-old males in the United States, he claimed that 79% were at zero (exclusively heterosexual) and 2.9% were at six (exclusively homosexual). (Kinsey, 1948, p. 651)   http://www.samesexattraction.org/how-many-are-gay.htm [Edit: Sorry, that source is crap, I mistook it for its opposite... at least they cited properly so it shouldn't be an issue.]  But in this very thread, it's touted that ""most people aren't heterosexual"" because nobody looks at the stats, they just see the scale. (And the ""progressive"" mindset does the rest  of the work - modern politics basically demand that the norm be shifted, reality be damned.)  As for OP, I can say that I've never had any kind of homosexual fantasy or activity, and that I'm frankly repulsed by the thought. That doesn't imply a political opinion or societal stance (the above criticism of ""progressivism"" is more rooted in my distaste for any ideology in general), others can have as much fun with the same sex as they want and I imagine an exclusively gay man may have the same revulsion towards heterosexual sex."
TooAfraidToAsk,3cmako,genitaliban,10,Thu Jul 9 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's dangerous at all to assume that there are people who lie on all areas of the spectrum.

Thinking I had to choose between the two extremes kept me confused for years.   As to the study that you cited, it is very out of date and problematic even for its time. Admitting any homosexual leanings in the 40-50's was looked down upon and much more likely to be suppressed. Plus, that study looked only at twenty-five year old men. A 2011 study from the Williams Institute suggests that 11% of people admit to some same sex attraction. I would argue this number would be even higher now with the recent LGBT+ rights movement successes and exponential growth of public opinion acceptance.  Lastly, you can be heterosexual and still have homosexual fantasies. That's covered on the Kinsey scale. Not one single person in this thread has said that most people are not heterosexual. Seriously, I just read through the whole thing and no one said that. People have expressed that you can be straight and have homosexual desires while remaining straight.

Being outside of the majority does not mean lesser.  Now onto the super fun breakdown! This is gonna be a good one.   It's by Kinsey. You were talking about the Kinsey scale. Of course it's out of date, I just provided context.   You stated his statistical findings as fact. Bolded them, even. Just as many of Freud's findings are no longer accepted, we can take what is still useful (aka the scale) out of past research and build on it.    Conversely meaning that 89% didn't. (Which seems absurdly high, but whatever, it supports my point.)   I never said heterosexual people were anything but the majority. No one said that, and you're weirdly latching on to it. Heterosexual people are in the majority. It's everywhere, we all know that. We live in a heteronormative culture because this is the case.   ""Heterosexual"" of course meaning ""exclusively heterosexual"" in this context - seeing how I had just quoted a paragraph referring to that I thought it was obvious.   Uhhh ""heterosexual"" does not automatically mean ""exclusively heterosexual"" at all. In fact, you can identify as exclusively heterosexual and have the occasional homosexual fantasy. Totally normal. You can be a 1 on the Kinsey scale and still exclusively date, love, and fuck the opposite sex. You completely made up a quote. If you ctfl+f what you said, you are the only person in the entire thread to have said ""most people aren't heterosexual.""

And you come off as not having understood that my problem isn't the fluidity of the scale but that most people interpret it wrongly. My entire point hinged on them inferring the normal or equal distribution which you didn't even refer to.    I'm apologize, I'm really, really not understanding how you think people interpreting the scale as ""people exist at every number on this"" is wrong or ""dangerous"" (this frankly homophobic phrasing is really what got me to engage in this conversation with you). Just because .0002% of people might be, say, a 4 on the scale doesn't mean they don't exist. That doesn't mean that someone learning about the scale for the first time might not identify as a 4. People thinking that it is normal to exist at any number on the scale is not a bad thing.   You claim that your entire ""point"" hinged on the fact that people who identify as heterosexual vastly outnumber any other sexuality, a point that is supported by statistics and which no one is arguing against, myself included. I actually did bring it up in my original reply when I said:   it's healthier to be able to give yourself the freedom to figure out where you lie without worrying about the ""norm.""    In case you didn't catch it, that's where we were both working from the assumption that heterosexuality is the statistical norm. I was arguing that it doesn't matter what the norm is, because you (you in the general, not you specifically since you have identified as the straightest of straight) may lie outside of that norm, so when you look at the scale and are trying to figure it all out, it's most helpful to go with your gut and not worry about where most people fall. This is practical and helpful advice for OP and other readers who identify with OP.  I stand by my downvote; at best, you did not add anything to the conversation other than basically saying, ""you know most people are straight though,"" which is a foregone conclusion and not helpful.

Assuming a normal or equal distribution is not equal to saying ""there are people on every part of the scale"" - if that were not the case, there wouldn't be a scale.

To explain: When I was a teenager, I learned about gays/lesbians, and I heard about people who can 'convert' someone from gay to straight. I know it's bullshit and I was pretty sure of it then, but I thought, what the hell, I've got a pretty vivid imagination. Like I can close my eyes and just make up a movie on the spot, and bam, I'm watching it, or I'm in it. (Not sure how common this is. If you call BS, I guess it's not that common.) So anyway, I tried to see if anything with a dude would get me excited. Now, mind you, I was about 12 or 13.  Results were pretty much unanimous. Not the slightest bit of rise. I'm pretty close to 100% straight, but I've always been a straight ally. I even kinda envy gays sometimes. I mean, imagine a couple bros, playing video games, going out driving, drinking beer, and then that's your mate as well as, you know, your mate in the English or Australian sense. It's like two for one. But then I met my wife and we do all those things together. There's lots of cool chicks out there. So not really envy so much as now I know what I know, but back then when my cool friends were guys and girls might as well have been from Venus, maybe you can see where I'm coming from.  OP, I think the operative word you're looking for was 'wonder,' not fantasize, in which case I'm sure we all wonder about a great many things. The difference is like, you see the trailer for 50 Shades of Grey... If you wonder, you're just thinking ""Would I like to be tied up?"" or ""Would I like to tie someone up?"". If you fantasize about it, you know you'd like it and it excites you. The excitement is the difference. And then there's a difference between fantasy and reality.  OP, if you're wondering or even fantasizing about gay sex, it doesn't make you gay, it makes you curious, and that's fine. Being gay is fine, too, but if you're straight and you're sure you're straight, questioning the other side doesn't mean you're ON the other side. It's okay to wonder, it's one of the greatest things we as humans do, and it's why we fly and why we've been to space and while we will eventually walk on other worlds. Because one person said what if, and another person figured out how to make it happen."

A paralysis of the stomach muscles, doesn't force your innards to digest things as quickly so it tends to back up and you get a couple massive dooks a week instead of several human sized ones.    I speak from experience, I was diagnosed with this a couple years ago but apparently I've always had it, far back as I can remember I've alway had inhumanely sized dumps.  This was the reason.  High fiber foods are actually extremely bad for you if you have gastroparesis.  As are fatty foods.  High caloric but less fatty foods work well, things like protein drinks and smoothies.  Try switching to a mostly liquid (again, smoothies, protein and energy drinks, ensure, that type of thing) for a week or so mixed with lots of grilled chicken.  See if that helps.

It is really easy to focus on one part of your own body and look at it sort of ""out of context"". As in, if you look at your wrist, or thigh, or arm, or whatever, and just look at that one body part, sure you can make it look big to yourself. You are not looking at it as a part of your whole body, and how the size is proportionate to your whole body. But if you look at the whole picture, you can see that none of those individual parts are big. I'm not sure if I'm making much sense here, it sounded better in my head...

TooAfraidToAsk,3c6wc3,ADeadKitty,2,Sun Jul 5 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"As you are after an honest review... here goes.  You are thin yes, way thinner than your average 'thin' person, and I fully understand if you see yourself as bigger than you are - it's a common problem and you aren't alone. But try look at things differently.  Below is a simple and quite useful exercise you might find helpful when seeing yourself as a 'block'.  Find a photo of anyone on an a4 sheet of paper that you think is the norm for your height (it's important you are a very similar heoght). I'm not talking about some skinny model from your favourite glamor magazine... I'm talking about maybe a friend, a well known person who is healthy. Firstly understand why they are attractive, ideal and most importantly healthy looking. Then after you have agreed with yourself (and someone else for clarification that they are a healthy looking individual) stand back from the mirror and hold it up so you and that individual on the page is standing right next to you proportionally. Then simply compare and contrast. Notice the difference in body shape. Shoulders, thighs, arms, legs, even knees! You will hopefully notice that their shape is not the same as yours. Mostly the curves will be a big factor in the difference. After hearing what you have said about thinking you look block-like... it might well be because you don't have the curves. If you are thin like yourself, your body becomes very pointed, most notably in your shoulders. So if you stand there naked, you will see a squared off shoulder,with a dramatic 90° angle straight to the floor. No hips offering a break between your shoulders, ribs and the floor.   You don't have to eat crap or tonnes of food to get better. Just little and often. Judge how much you eat by others with a similar metabolism, not a similar size. If you digest and burn calories at a rapid rate, eat healthy fats like avocados. If you struggle to eat big meals, eat little and often.   As cliché as it might be... it's all in the balance. Finding the right one for you!  Good luck!"

On top of that, I'm sure you may have a fear of the weight to begin with.   But to give you some supporting information, I'll attempt to help. Women and men gather fat reserves or bulk in different parts of the body. Fat is useful in small amounts for insulation, energy reserves and to keep the body with a steady flow of energy. Men gather bulk in thier stomachs and chest while women generally get the waist, thighs thing which will make you look disproportionate at first. Every stage of getting better or doing something different has this weird ""in between stage"" as you might often hear it referred to as. When growing out your hair, there is that moment where it won't do anything. When men workout after getting a little chub, they'll actually look fatter for a moment because muscle underneath is growing faster than the condensed fat they've accumulated but when the body realizes what you are trying to do, it will change for you.  You will have this awkward in between stage at some point but it seems to be about 15-20 lbs away. This is going to be the hardest part on your psyche but work through it and you'll see the more beautiful you. Also, with anorexia, you don't have a lot of muscle and so the fat and muscle they are trying to put on you is going to make you feel slow and heavy not because you are slow and heavy but because your muscles don't know how to work with this new weight and body type. I co.pre it to fighting in a suit of armor, at first you'll feel ckunky and slow but when you get the hang of it, you'll be able to function normally as you felt you did before the disorder :).

Initially, you feel a little pocket there - sort of a hole where they have stitched it, and a blood clot forms there. You have to be gentle the first few days so you don't dislodge the clot resulting in a dry socket. For that reason, they tell you not to do anything using suction basically (no smoking, drinking through straws, etc). Bubbley drinks like soda are also a no-go because the bubbles can dislodge it. This is only for a short time though, and I was surprised how fast things healed up and I felt better. After it heals, I guess tissue of some kind fills in that pocket. I had mine removed years ago, and now that spot just feels like nothing. There's no hole, but it also doesn't feel like a scar. It just feels like smooth gums."

Get out and socialize if you can, surround yourself with people who feel good and can make you feel good. Find someone, anyone, that you can talk openly and honestly with.  The bitch about depression is that it's a mental illness in the literal sense of the word. It's difficult to think your way out of depression alone. Your brain is the enemy, so to speak. You need to find another person who can help you talk through your feelings, to figure out what is real, and what is the depression speaking.   Medication can be a useful assistant to help you get clear of some of the negative thoughts and emotions, but I wouldn't recommend going a medication only route. To be the best person you can be, the ideal situation is talk therapy and medication.  Also, remember, you are not alone. There are millions of us out there who have struggled or are struggling with depression. We've been there, we understand, and we're available to talk to if you need it."

I'd love to be like ""eat 1/4 lb of organic broccoli each day before noon"" and act like that's going to help. I'm assuming that wouldn't hurt? I don't know; I am not a nutritionist. Regardless that's not what you're asking.  Sometimes, if something happens, then it's natural to need to process your emotions and that can include going through periods like feeling extremely sad or incredibly angry. That doesn't make the pain or anger any less real, but it can be comforting to know that it's a natural human response.  Other times it can be a medical issue that needs treatment. Like, if you got a cut then you would put on a bandaid; if you can't see well then you wear corrective lenses.   ""Treatment"" in this sense is incredibly broad. Here are some options that help:   Having a healthy consistent diet -- this includes alcohol and smoking consumption Having a healthy consistent sleep schedule Getting exercise on a regular basis Picking up a hobby -- one thing that helps me is volunteering: it makes me feel better about myself because it gives me a sense of helping (I desperately need to be needed) while surrounding me with people who want to be there doing whatever Going to see a professional -- this can be anything from a school counselor to a general practitioner to a psychologist and everywhere in between, and can result in everything from therapy to medication to figuring out if it's caused because of some medication side-effect or some random medical thing that doesn't appear to be related to you or I Some way to reduce stress -- yoga is really great at this   None of these are a silver bullet.

It might help to think of it as similar to seeing a woman wearing a hijab: there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but by doing so the woman is exposing herself to criticism and prejudice, as well as openly sharing her opinions about at least a few issues (religion)."

Someone who dresses a certain way to ""fit in"" with a crowd should (hopefully) come into their own, and find their own style as they get older.  Someone who genuinely digs the look and feels comfortable and more like themselves will have already found their own style.

You have an ""intimate relationship"" with your penis, so to speak.  You've held it in your hand every day of your life when urinating (and later masturbating).  You know every lump, bump, vein, curve..  you know exactly which way it curves, what it looks like at its hardest, what it looks like when you've been in cold water, etc.    However, there is more to you than your penis.  If you are getting close to someone, then you already have a laundry list of things that this person finds attractive about you.  Your laugh, your eyes, the way the corners of your eyes crinkle when you smile, how your butt looks in a particular pair of jeans, the way they observe you treating others and animals, how you interact with your friends...  all these things (and thousands more) add up to what ""attraction"" is.  Your penis is usually one of the last things that others will interact with, and it just becomes a part of the ""package"" (for lack of a better term).  Getting over the idea of how much you feel your penis defines you can be difficult.  You cannot change its size, not really.  However, since you already are aware of the fat pad that exists on the front of your pelvis, that is a thing that can be changed.  You have direct control over that through diet and exercise.  I only know your height, I do not know your weight.  However:   Go to this site and calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate.   You can then take that number and use the Harris Benedict equation to determine how many calories your body uses each day just to exist in its current form. If you consume fewer calories than that number, you will lose weight; it's that simple.  That ""deficit"" of calories varies depending on how much weight you want to lose in a week.  1-2 pounds a week is  considered to be the healthiest course of action.  Initially, a lot of people will lose a bunch more than that right away, which is mostly water.  That causes a lot of discouragement when things seem to slow down (and they do) but it's important to press on.   Now, of course as you lose weight, the number of calories you take in will have to go down in order to continue progress.  Otherwise, if your weight continues to drop and you're taking in the same amount of calories, you will reach a new maintainence number.  Apps like My Fitness Pal and Lose It! help you to log everything you eat so you can keep track.  I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but the end result will be not only you being a healthier person, but also that little fat pad will start to disappear, showing your penis in its truer form.  /r/loseit"

If you and your gf are still virgins then it means I'm not too late -- you may benefit from two aspects of my experience:  My first was well-experienced.  I suffered humiliating impotence on our first several attempts at my 'first time' and when it finally happened, and a while thereafter, I was too insensitive for condoms but climaxed in like 20 seconds.  After a while I became more comfortable gettin' jiggy wid it because my girlfriend enjoyed cunnilingus (oh, thank god).  So even though it took me forever to get it up it was fine because I'd just devour her fragrant loins while casually stroking my dingdong and listening to her gasps of satisfaction until muhdikk was finally erect and I just sort of sunk into her embrace, kissing her neck and bringin' the D. If you're nervous and especially if you're worried about dicksize, this method is absolutely ideal because it gives you something cool to do while you get it up but more importantly, your lady is already glowing with affectionate and grateful passion and it's already awesome sex before your penis even enters the picture.  She doesn't even have to see it in this case -- perfect for you, the nervous virgin.   My second girlfriend a few years later was a virgin when we started dating; she'd watched hella porn but had zero real-life sexual experience beyond like, practice-kissing a gal-pal once.  I cannot emphasize enough that your girlfriend's virginity is going to assure that you bring not inferior peen but first-hand Carnal Knowledge.  It will rearrange her world and change her entire outlook and self-perception.  She has no idea what to expect going into it and you'll thrill her no matter what you do or how impressive your body is.  It will be the best sex she has ever had and sex with a virgin partner is unbelievably awesome and relaxed.  Women with sexual experience, likely to have enjoyed a great and mighty penis, behold muhdikk and it's very often the puniest adult-penis they'll ever see in person or touch.  Dick isn't a deal-breaker for women worth being intimate with -- but this doesn't mean that a great many don't prefer and fetishize the Phallus Enormous.    The fact that your girlfriend is a virgin should give you all the confidence you need.  Treat her respectfully (duhhhhh!) and you will both enjoy yourselves and the worst case scenario is that someday you'll break up and she'll hook up with a guy with an elephant-cock and finds it a lot more satisfying.  In that case, it's like you've given her this free extra door in the Labyrinth of Love and she gets to discover sex not once but twice."

But working at your university's help desk is very good. Experience is big in IT. I would expect to transition that to a help desk position at a company out of college. Help desk is usually the starting point in IT. I would look into getting some more professional certifications. A+ is a help desk cert and will help you get a help desk job. Personally, when recruiters contact me they have indicated that they were looking for someone with a CCNA. CCNA is a good networking certification and Cisco certs tend to be more highly regarded than others because they actually require you to do things. For instance, you have to physically program a switch during the CCNA test. There is also a Network+ certification for networking.   In order to transition from a help desk position to a network administrator position, you'll need some knowledge of networking fundamentals. Certs like the CCNA and Network+ can help you. You need to learn about things like DNS, DHCP, VLANs, routing tables, etc. These are all concepts I interact with daily at my job (I work as a network administrator).   70k/year is very doable in IT. My brother-in-law works as a Network Engineer and makes $65k/year at 35 years old. And he graduated with a BS in Graphics Design.  In my opinion, get your 4 year degree (corporate America is obsessed with bachelor degrees), and then professional certifications are your way forward."

I'm a bit doubtful my major will cover those topics, so do you have a suggestion for prepping for those certs? Like I said, I'd like to really get into that probably next summer."
TooAfraidToAsk,3aiquv,bigDean636,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"Prepping for certs can be whatever you want it to be. You could go to a class or you could just buy a book. Some places sell practice certs to help you prep. Some of the practice certs have actual word-for-word questions that you'd see on the real cert. As for how hard the certs are, it really depends on the vendor. CompTIA certs (like A+) are pretty straightforward. So are Cisco certs: if you know the material, you'll be fine. Microsoft actively tries to trick you. In my opinion, if you take any Microsoft certs you'll want to purchase or pirate practice certs because some of the questions are so screwy you'll get them wrong if you've never seen them before. It really depends on how much money you have to spend and how thoroughly you want to practice the material.   One thing I would recommend is setting up a home lab. Get a computer and some hypervisor software so you can create virtual machines, then get a book for the cert you want to take and a lab book and do the labs on the virtual machine. All of this can be costly, but some places have student discounts. Your school might even have Microsoft DreamSpark access (mine did), which lets you download all Microsoft software for free. When you're working in the field, you might be able to convince your company to pay for you to take classes and certs.   You didn't ask for this advice, but I'm going to give it anyway: there are some things I didn't know about IT until I started working in the field and encountered them. You will forever be plagued by bosses that have business knowledge but little to no technical knowledge. The good ones will lean on your expertise to make decisions, the bad ones will make decisions and let you clean up their mess. Nobody cares how you fixed something, they only care that you fixed it. If you called up Microsoft support with tears in your eyes and they held your hand and walked you through fixing something, nobody cares. All they care about is you're the person who got it fixed. On the other hand, nobody wants to hear about what you did or didn't know. It is always IT's fault. Nobody ever asks the question, ""Why did the salesman input his information into the database incorrectly?"" and everyone asks the question, ""Why did IT allow the information to be entered incorrectly in the database?"" The only thing anyone cares about is results.   On the good side, the skills are very transferable and usually in demand. If I lost my job tomorrow I think I could have a new one within a month. You hop around a lot in IT, especially in the beginning of your career. If you are lucky (like me), you'll have a senior admin or engineer who will mentor you when you are just getting started with network administration.  IT can be an enjoyable and rewarding career, but never ever forget that you are an expense to the company. The company doesn't want to have to hire IT people. If something isn't working, you're not doing your job. And never stop learning. You'll be learning and changing your entire career.

Some people get off being in control, some people love it when they have no control. Sometimes you have to exaggerate the power dynamic by humiliating the other person or being humiliated.  I don't know a whole lot about it, nor do I participate, but I've heard /r/bdsm is a very nice community and can probably answer any question you have.   EDIT: wow, ignore all of this and just read /u/rainnefox's comment below this."
TooAfraidToAsk,3ah1br,Qeezy,10,Sat Jun 20 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"To add on this, /r/BDSMcommunity is another great resource and is full of super friendly people willing to answer questions!    The acronym 'BDSM' stands for several things:   Bondage and Discipline, Domination and Submission, & Sadism and Masochism and is used to help define the basic structures of the 'kink' world.  For many people it is a form of release (sexually and/or emotionally) to have someone step into a position of power over them and vice versa to have someone submit to them and allow them to take control.   It's hard to explain, but in a scene, the person submitting has the power to control what happens.  It is the job of the dominant person to give the submissive what they need and if that is to be tied down and whipped or tickled or paint their toenails then that is what they'll do.  (And yes, I have painted someone's toenails in the middle of a scene :P)   Ideally the Dominant person gets what they need out of a scene (or a lifestyle in some cases) by taking care of the needs of their Submissive partner.  In the end, it's about taking care of the needs of your partner just like in any relationship.     Feel free to PM me and I'll do my best to answer any specific questions you might have as best I can!"

I realize, of course, that some of those types of questions would be difficult to answer ( maybe even seem impossible), but if you were to address these questions as honestly as you can just as if they asked you face-to-face, I think it would help the people you leave behind to gradually accept your decision.

I write down my notes a d reasons and try to answer questions they or I might have.   Personally I'm not ready to do it yet. Like Ritz said, you know when you're ready when you don't need any help. Coming to the community and asking for answers infers that you aren't ""man"" enough. Not in the sort of insulting manner of Ritz's comment but essentially you aren't educated enough in the reasons why you want to do it, you just know that you want to. One day I know I'll cut the cord but until I know why for sure and that there is no way out, then I'll keep going. Sure my job sucks andbi have to bike 45 minutes to two jobs everyday along a highway in Florida summers. Sure I have done horrible things or felt no escape but after writing a note and coming back to it in the morning. I realize they are tivial responses. If I'm going to kill my self, its going to have to be something substantial. Is a shark eating me? Am I about to be dismembered alive or tortured and raped and killed? Or am I going to be in perpetual pain that will eventually get so bad I have to become a vegetable? Or will I eventually forget who I am and all the things I've done and the people I've loved? No not quite yet.  It's not a cowardice thing to do. It's your life and choice. But you have to make an informed decision and like Ritz said, coming to a subreddit and asking for advice means you aren't ready. I hope the day you are that it's quick and painless or even better, I hope you find the one thing that keeps you from ever doing it. I love you man, haven't met you but we are quite similar and my gut tells me to say I love you bro or bro-let? Lol I'm not sure what a female bro would be. Her.aphroditic? Well off topic now.

TooAfraidToAsk,3ad1lo,SexualPie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:26:45 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your rationale for killing yourself and what your thoughts are toward the people around you. Are there people around you who you truly love, and whose well-being you'd care about even if you were dead? If so, it makes sense to leave a comprehensive note, as it will give them a sense of closure and serve as a last message from you that will help keep them going through the tragedy. Even if it might seem like it could hurt them more in the short term, trust me, the reasons they'll make up in their minds are far worse than the reasons you actually have.  If you're more the type who is doing it because you don't have anyone around you, or you don't care about the world around you, etc. then maybe a note isn't necessary, but it's still probably the right thing to do. I'm sure you have good reasons for killing yourself and I'm sure someone out there would geniunely like to know what those reasons are, and I'd guess you probably want at least one person to know those reasons as well, so your entire struggle and experience isn't just washed away once you pull the trigger."

TooAfraidToAsk,3ad2xl,ugandanigga,2,Fri Jun 19 04:10:04 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, just because the people that sold them might have been from Africa, doesn't mean they're from the same people. There's racism between African ethnicities, between ""Chinese"" peoples, between European cultures, etc. So what you're saying doesn't apply across the board. White slavers, black slavers, warlords, and, sometimes, families were all people who sold slaves.   Also, rum wasn't the universal price; among people who use a barter system, price is determined by current wants and needs.   As to your question, I'd suggest it probably isn't common knowledge. The whole situation was pretty messed up, and the slave trade is still going strong today. Traffickers and families (we like to think they're all desperate,  but life is harsher than that) can give a pretty good picture of what the slave trade was like for Africans. They're just more discrete now. America is still a destination for many slaves. And the facts behind it are still largely ignored."

Slavery existed in virtually every region and culture long before the transatlantic slave trade. And I know you said you're not meaning to be racist, but inadvertently that's exactly what you're portraying with your second question.

I don't know enough about the science of vasectomies to say for certain, just that there was no more shooting as soon as I was healed up enough to use it again, and it's never returned.  Doesn't seem to be much of a problem though, just something that changed after that surgery."
TooAfraidToAsk,3a608q,funfungiguy,2,Wed Jun 17 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"This put me at ease AND makes me uneasy at the same time. It sounds like its something thats pretty normal and nothing to worry about, but It makes me question if it has anything to do with fertility (which i did wonder previous to this thread... if they don't shoot, how far can they swim?)  We just started trying to get pregnant, too. Hmm."
TooAfraidToAsk,3a608q,funfungiguy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:51:42 2015 UTC,"Well, the sperm travel at a rate of about 1-inch every fifteen minutes, roughly.  How far they have to travel to reach an egg depends on where the egg is technically, as it's possible for a woman to become pregnant while on her period, but for a sperm to reach the Fallopian tubes from the cervix, I has to swim about 6-inches, which should take roughly 90 minutes, once the sperm has reached the cervix of course.  (Sperm cells can live for up to 48, if I recall correctly, before the woman's pH starts to kill them, though a 48-hour old sperm cell won't have much energy left over.  I would speculate that there are lots of ways one can get to the cervix faster.  A larger penis, possibly a stronger ejaculation...  I know a lot of women will place a pillow under their hips during or immediately after sex to help it flow back towards the cervix.  But I wouldn't think a dribbling flow would have too much influence on fertility, any more than penis size...  If there's any influence, I would think it to be fairly minimal at best.  There would be a lot more reasonable influences as to why a couple would have difficulty conceiving a baby.  Bear in mind that it took my wife and I a long time before our first child was conceived even when mine shot further.  Other things to bear in mind is even when I shot further, it wasn't always the same distance.  If I was more excited it seemed to go further, and if I was just sort of into it, not as far.  That applied to sex and masturbation.  A porno that was just so-so didn't shoot as far as one that I was really into, which probably has some effect on excitement and the muscle contractions.  Now that I'm fixed, I would say that my libido has gone down (which my wife would also agree with, and has mentioned).  It's not a major issue or anything; we still have sex pretty regularly but not as much as before.  I think for some reason, a tiny part of my monkey-brain is maybe thinking ""This feels good and all, but it's all rather pointless from a biological standpoint, isn't it?""  It's like, when part of the back of your head is thinking that what you're doing isn't ever going to biologically achieve what the process is designed for, maybe some of the intensity wanes a bit.  Most people don't experience a lower libido after a vasectomy, so it may very well be a personal issue with me, but if some of the ""virility"" (for lack of a better word) has been removed, then everything is about our feelings for one another, and because sex feels good, but the excitable monkey-brain saying ""this is for making more monkeys"" has been retired, and maybe that results in a lower interest in having as much sex and a lower excitement level, and a less explosive load.  This is all purely speculative, and how I've spent the last couple years turning things over in my own head.  I have no scientific evidence to support it."

Hell, I didn't get married until I was 38. It was a very smart course of action. You'll find that you make much wiser decisions in your late 30's than in your early 20's.   Most people that are 22 don't own a home, or a career. Career? A 22 year-old is just barely starting out. You'll find many of your peers switch careers in time.   If you live at home, move out. 22 is too old to live at home. Maybe that's what people mean by 'grow up'. If you don't live at home, then don't grow up.  When I was 22, I had a good job, a nice apartment, lots of good friends, a beautiful girlfriend who was insane, and an even more beautiful girlfriend who was always so sweet and supportive. Guess which one I chose? Of course the insane one. I was 22. A different organ is in charge of the whole deal.   At 22, I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you like things that other people find childish then screw them. You don't have to grow up all the way. Heck, I'll be 45 in two weeks and I just bought a huge box of Legos at a yard sale. I do not have kids. I will share them with my friends that don't make fun of them. The others can miss out on the fun.   You're 22. You've got plenty of time to find a career path, settle down and get married. Sometimes I still wonder what I want to be when I grow up. I've made major career changes before. Why not again?   At almost 45, my advice is to enjoy being young while you still are. Nobody expects you to be a parent. Nobody expects you to be a neurosurgeon. Just enjoy it while you can, but don't do anything stupid."

I don't think anyone ever feels like an adult or a child, just like themselves. You're just used to being a child while you feel like yourself, so you have that association.  As to the drama, in my experience that'll carry on until 25 or later. It'll go easier once you realize you aren't limited to your high school friends anymore. I've cut out most of my old friends because we grew in different directions, and have an entirely new set of friends, basically. The other thing that will make it easier is learning to love/accept changing yourself. Realizing that you're wrong, admitting that, and working to change a toxic behavior is so cathartic it's almost elating.

Using tampons, doing horseback riding (apparently) and having sex will weather the hymen. Because of the former two, associating an intact hymen with virginity is not relevant for today. Also, the hymen needs to be open even a little bit so the blood can escape!  You can ask your mom or GYNO for help. Both are willing to give advice, or even get some lubrication to help. I think when I first used a tampon, my mom had something in the house safe to put on the applicator. (I don't want to ruin childhood by remembering what it was.)  I suggest Tampax Pearl or U by Kotex. Both use plastic applicators with curved ends. It is easier to guide in, and will not absorb moisture (so you can stay lubricated).  I suggest asking this on a female targeted sub. While I'm female I can't give much other advice than what has been said. Maybe, go on your back, legs apart but tucked towards your body. Then try putting the tampon in.   Try carefully. I really think asking your mom or OBGYN for help ease anxiety. Doing such helps to relax the muscles that make it harder for the tampon to enter.  Don't worry the tampon will not fall out, even if it's small.  Good luck. Every woman understands and has been in your position."

TooAfraidToAsk,397dx5,hitemp,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:42:49 2015 UTC,It could be the angle or the size. I have always found using tampons to be a little painful.

TooAfraidToAsk,397dx5,Drewcifer236,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Well if you aren't sexually active yet that may be a big part of the issue.

If bathing there is plenty of water so just agitating this water with your hand in the general area will do the trick.  Now showers can be a bit trickier but are possible. It is possible to stand under the shower head so the water flows neatley into the offending crevice.

This mechanism may lend itself to our brains having more and more of a mess of connections when we don't get enough (good) sleep, perhaps causing that voice-hearing head experience since we have an overgrowth of neural pathways going on - either cross chatter between pathways (which incidentally seems to happen as we get old too and some of the protective coating/sheathing on neural pathways gets thin) or just a lot of different stuff going on as we subconsciously try to navigate our minds, like wtf suddenly a whole bunch of new stops got added to my subway line; this could also lend itself to a hypnagogic state as we begin to fall asleep and those neural connection start to be reabsorbed and you get head chatter along with other bits of ""hallucination"" at times.

Above that is considered excessive. But that's just one recommendation.

If he only drinks a 12-pack in an evening, he's drinking light. There were times in his life where it destroyed relationships with family, friends, and has cost him jobs.  He still drinks, a lot, but has his life more under control. He can survive in social situations while sober, has held the same job for over 5 years, and even has a girlfriend.  I'm not saying you're going down that road, but you have to be able to recognize when there is a problem. A drink or two every night? That's just letting off a little steam from a hard day's work.

There really isn't a right answer.   For ME, the amount is none. I don't like being drunk. I don't like being buzzed all that much. And I hate hangovers.

Sounds like you two have a sound relationship with each other.   One a day isn't alcoholic drinking. As others have noted, it can become a slippery slope if you begin a relationship with alcohol that becomes unhealthy. It's different for each person--alcohol begins as a relaxant which can ease you off to sleep. Too much can disrupt sleep and interfere with REM sleep because it also has excitatory properties on the sympathetic nervous system which lead to rapid heart rate and increased blood pressure (If I drank alcohol before bedtime, I'd wake up at around 2:00 a.m. with my heart racing).   Reliance upon it in lieu of dealing with problems (sleep issues, work or relationship issues, etc.) leads to other problems which become apparent with increased use.   If you become uncomfortable with what you're doing, listen to yourself. If your wife becomes concerned, listen to her and consider it. As for me--I went from non-drinker at age 29 to blackout drinker within 4 months. My relationship with it became dysfunctional very, very rapidly."

It may not retain its strict meaning of ""dark-skinned people directly descended from the African continent"" anymore, but in the USA, where race is a going concern, it's a phrase that works in many situations, especially among strangers. It gets the point across without being racially insensitive, which is a very helpful thing.  ""European-Americans,"" on the other hand, is a term that's never been in wide usage, and has been claimed pretty excitedly (for many of the reasons you mention in your question) by many white supremacist groups. If you use it, you risk being lumped in with Nazis by whoever you're talking to. (If that's no concern to you, then go to town, I guess.)"

You don't really see it referenced in TV because it's not really true. All races like fried chicken just as much as black people. The whole idea is really just a relic of more racist times."
TooAfraidToAsk,37u561,TheBoredMan,2,Sat May 30 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"In the southern United States, shortly after the era of slavery in this country, black Americans often had little choices when it came to food.  The food had to be cheap, as they were poor.  So, many black Americans became very adept at making cheap food  (food that their more wealthy, white counter-parts would never eat).  Also, for the record, this applies to poor, white Americans as well.  Regardless, chickens  (or ""yard birds"") were abundant, as were river-fish  (which would also be fried), ""greens"", beans, etc.  Often these dishes in America are today referred to as ""soul food"".  Watermelons were more rare and a special treat.  So, fast-forward to the early part of the last century.  A stereotype of a black person with a piece of fried chicken or enjoying a juicy watermelon became a running gag.  Today, this antiquated humor is considered offensive.  As cuisines in America have meshed, traditionally ""poor"" Southern cuisine is now considered a staple among all citizens.  Besides, cultures the world over enjoy chicken - fried or otherwise.  So, bottom line, this was just a racist American stereotype that has since been derided.  It's still a joke.  I have many black friends, for example, that will cringe a bit when ordering fried chicken when we're out to dinner.  Nevertheless, it's now more of a ""funny"" stereotype, if that makes sense.  Just like ""white people can't dance"".  Of course, it's not true...but there are enough of us that can't dance to make the stereotype a stereotype.  As to why you didn't encounter this ""joke"" in your tv/film watching travels, I'm genuinely surprised.  To be honest, I must doubt that you've watched every American TV show or movie about black people  (I sure you've watched many in your ""studies"").  It's a pretty common trope.  But, again, it's a stereotype and considered offensive to a degree.  Hope that clears it up!"

Firstly, the human eye/brain is the most efficient pattern recognition system known to man. We can see patterns everywhere, in places that don't make sense -- for example, the classic Jesus/Virgin Mary in a piece of toast. In this case, you're seeing some pattern.  Second, there is a strong stereotype bias for this;  equating other people and races to animals was and still is a common means of dehumanizing those people. Stories and art featuring African people as ""apes"" were used for degradation. Any perception you have of people is likely tainted by this cultural undercurrent, so your pattern recognition is reinforced and biased based due to these stereotypes.  That said, to answer your question: no, Africans are not ""more apelike"" or ""closer to our ape ancestors"" than any other humans. To suggest this is to suggest that other races are ""more evolved"" than Africans, for which there is no supporting evidence whatsoever. It can't be stated enough that humans are all the same species, and no race of humans is more or less evolved than any other."

One - You can do a lot simply with a pair of scissors. Just be careful - you will only want to cut hair, not skin (ouch!). Go in portions, pull gently on the tips of a small portion of hair to extend them fully, and cut between your fingertips and your skin. And move on to the next portion, until you are at a desired length of hair everywhere.  You might end up cutting too much hair by accident, but it will grow back anyway, so why not experiment? You may want to try also a bikini trimmer (disclaimer: I don't have experience with that particular make or model), whose comb guide will let you shave to a predetermined hair length.  In any case, if you haven't already done so, I'd suggest that before you start your trimming session, you first familiarize yourself thoroughly with the entirety of your pubic region. Choose a time and a place where you will not be disturbed, take a handheld mirror, and explore. Tug on hair (gently!) to get to know where it grows and where it doesn't, and move the flappy bits to find out what they cover. You're not ashamed to look at your hands, are you? Your pubic region is a part of you in the exact same way, no reason why you shouldn't be completely familiar with it.  Two - Firstly, other people's sexuality doesn't define your sexuality. What other people have or haven't done by the time they reached your age is not important. You need to find out what excites you, and what doesn't; what other people may or may not have done in their teens does not figure into that. There are such things as asexuality and low sex drive, but I wouldn't dare suggest I have any idea where you stand in that scale - that's for you to figure out.  I'm in no way an expert, but I'd say listen to your body, not your brain. When you encounter sexual material - not necessarily straight up porn, but e.g. erotic literature, do you remember ever getting a sort of warm, tingly sensation in your vaginal area? A feeling that might get you to go ""hmm, I kinda like the feeling of that, wonder how I could make that happen again"". And if you get that feeling again, you might at some point go ""hmm, I wonder what it would feel like if I touch the tingly bits"". It's really not much more complicated than that. Simply - if it feels good, go for it.  I'm not sure how much help that is, I hope it's at least some. But to end, here's a final practical tip: a handheld showerhead with strong enough (but not too strong) water pressure can be a girl's best friend. Not aimed, ahem, directly inside, but at varying angles. Again, if it feels good, go for it."

I considered that maybe I was just asexual. I met my current boyfriend, and he was interested in sex. Since I wasn't AGAINST it, I let him try to convince me, thinking there was really no way he would.  When I met him, I was a virgin and he had three other sexual partners. He was very patient with me and we communicated a lot about how it all was. So he tried foreplay with me, and I guess I liked it enough that I let him continue and we had sex, and it felt good. As I'm sure you know, your body has spots that are designed to make you like sex, so during sex, I'm actually invested in it, I'm not lying there thinking of a grocery list. And when we're not having sex, I don't masturbate, even if I like the feeling of sex. I just have a low sex drive.

TooAfraidToAsk,35sqsg,HiDDENk00l,1 point,Tue May 19 09:06:03 2015 UTC,"white people can’t say the n-word because there is a power imbalance in society. Since white people have more power, there’s always a racial connotation to the word when white people say it. Even if you’re not white, the word “Negro” means black and is a slur only against black people, regardless of ethnicity. Because of that, when non-black people of color use the word, its enforcing that power imbalance. Black people can use the n-word because the n-word is specifically used against black people, it can only be reclaimed by black people. It can never have racist connotation when used towards black people by black people because they’re on the same level in society. Common questions: Can I use the n-word in music? No. Does it mean “friend”? No, it means black. What if my black friends let me say it? It isn’t a matter of getting permission. You shouldn’t want to use it despite who gives you a pass. Also, your friend doesn’t speak for the entire black community."

By saying I belong to a religion/sect , people are more relating to the the shared cultural practices, view of morals,  ritual, shared political beliefs, and many more things.  Notably, factors such as  the belief in existence of an omnipotent omniscient  go, the historical underpinnings of the specific practices, are secondary and so do not make a difference to cultural self identify.

This means you give Reddit real money and the user gets certain perks which are outlined here.  You can also buy gold for yourself.   How do I now if someone replyed on my comment?   With the computer interface (as opposed to mobile devices) you will have your username at the top right of the screen.  Just to the right of that is an envelope (although some subreddits change the image).  This envelope will change colors when you have a new notification.  This includes responses to comments, posts, direct messages, username mentions (e.g. if someone types /u/YesThatsNotMe anywhere on reddit), and being gifted gold.   In the top left corner on my computer screen (where my username, settings and that is) there is this -> (1) <- next to my username. Pretty sure it's not a message, because it's not at the enelope, but what is it then??   Pretty sure that's on the to right of the computer screen.  The (1) is your link karma.  You get karma (which is just useless internet points) for doing two things on this site:  posting links to elsewhere on the internet, and posting comments.    Oddly, making an all-text post (like the one you made here—""New to Reddit, and basically just don't understand how it works - help!"") don't count for karma in either section.  You get points when someone sees something you've posted or commented and upvotes it.   What is a multibeta?   I'm not sure that anything goes by that name (edit: actually, looks like that's the term for multireddits while they were still in beta).  Are you asking about multireddits?  That's when you take several subs and view them at once.  For example, if you really like farm animals then you could create a multi of /r/cows and /r/sheep by going to /r/cows+sheep.  You can create your own mixes of subreddits on the front page by expanding the toolbar on the left side of the page (if it was hidden) and hitting the ""create"" button under multireddits, then add the ones you like.  These multis will be visible to you only, but you can open the multi (click on its name on that same toolbar) and make it public by clicking the button on the right side of the page. This will allow you to share your multi, which is the focus of the subreddit /r/multihub   And can I just create my own subreddit?   Yep! You'll have to find an unclaimed name, though.  Just go to the home page and hit the ""create your own subreddit"" button, then fill out all the forms and you're good to go!  You'll automatically be the top moderator of the new sub and will have pretty complete control over its operation."

It's a feature developed by reddit, and like all new features to a large coding project there are bound to be bugs.  Once they got all of those worked out they pushed the project out of beta, which is where it is now.   And how can I view several subs at once? Like, physically on my computer screen? Doesn't make sense to me..   It's very much like viewing your front page (what you see when you go to www.reddit.com) or when you view /r/all (or when you view the /r/cows+sheep multi that I linked, for that matter).  It shows a list of posts just like when you're only viewing one sub, but now the posts don't all come from the same sub.   And and, the (1) - I've posted comments more than once.. does it not count when I comment on someones comment?   That counts for your comment karma, which you can see when you go to your user page (/u/YesThatsNotMe for you, or anyone can go to /u/me and it'll redirect to your user page if you're logged in).  Looks to me like you've got 5 comment karma right now.   And and and - how do you do that, where, when you post a comment (like this one you posted right here), and there is one sentence of what I wrote, that's kinda copied in your comment, but the text is grey?

Reddit can be a versatile tool for learning while entertaining yourself. I use Reddit as a frontpage of my own internet.  For example: I deleted almost all of the default subreddits, installed RES (Its a Reddit addon, get it!) and searched for things and hobbies that interests me. Now, my frontpage is filled with useful and genuinely funny entertainment.  So instead of /r/funny, /r/news and /r/adviceanimals I get /r/Youtubehaiku, /r/Askhistorians and /r/calvinandhobbes which makes browsing Reddit a lot more joyful.

If you're very, very sensitive to gore or certain topics (I for one just can't stand reading accounts of people who had to put their dogs down), you can get reddit extensions that will block things that are too much for you.  Some people, especially women, report getting an insane amount of disgusting commentary.  Some subs do a pretty good job policing that; others don't."

That being said, as I understand it, scratching a dog's belly activates a scratch reflex, and the leg-shaking is involuntary. The dog's nervous system assumes that where there's scratching, there must be itching, so the leg basically goes into auto-shake mode even if there's no itch. However, most dogs like having their bellies scratched, because it's like having the relief of scratching an itch without the actual itch. That's how I've heard it explained, anyway."

TooAfraidToAsk,31vjll,Johner1261,4,Thu Apr 9 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm actually pretty familiar with networking, and I can try and explain a lot of this.  Yeah, you can just register with a different name. On Reddit that's what happens when you get shadowbanned. Your account gets banned, but you can still use the site normally or make a new one, and I think that's encouraged.   IP addresses SOMETIMES change, it depends on whether the IP is static or dynamic. Some IPs don't really change, and some do. Dynamic ones may change, static IPs almost definitely won't, however your internet provider may change it if if you upgrade internet services or have a similar problem. Most people will with static IPs can just use a VPN, proxy, or the Tor network, which all just send your data to another service which then forwards that data to a website and back to you. The website gets the IP of the proxy, VPN, or Tor node, but not yours. (There are some small exceptions to this, like X-FORWARDED-FOR, (which is spoofable) but they're aren't very notable.)   If an IP address changes, and browser cookies (things in a browser that store information) don't include the fact that you're banned (they can do stuff using cryptography so it's essentially impossible to trick users into banning themselves through cookies.), then you're free. If moderators catch on to you again, they'll probably be upset. But you still evaded the ban.   If someone randomly gets an IP from someone who's banned, then the odds that that someone will browse the same website are probably pretty slim. This is the same reason range bans are used, which is extremely relevant. I'll go into that.   Say someone changes their IP because their IP is dynamic. The steps for doing this vary depending on internet provider, but let's just say they turn their internet box on and off. (You can read into DHCP, NAT, and IPv4 and v6 in general if this topic interests you) Their IP will go from something like 100.100.100.100 to 100.100.99.50. You won't get a drastically different IP, just a somewhat different IP, and so if you host say a gaming server that gets 3000 unique visitors a week, and some dude with IP 100.100.100.100 is ruining the server and changing their IP, you could just range ban all IPs from 100.100.98.0 to 100.100.255.255 and not lose many members, then whitelist any IPs known not to be a server ruiner if that's even a problem. Yahoo has an article on IP range: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/yahoo-merchant-solutions/range-addresses-sln19645.html  Typically you don't need to ban everything in the 100.100.XXX.XXX, just 100.100.(90-110).(0-255) and you'll pretty much have no problems since you're not dealing with a massive server userbase. The next time this person changes their IP, their new IP will probably fall within range of your banned IP range because of how ISPs assign new IP addresses and so the problem will be solved.   If you have ANY questions, I'll happily answer them, and if you need me to elaborate on anything at all just ask. I'm pretty bad at explaining things so I don't mind practice. :P"
TooAfraidToAsk,31vjll,Johner1261,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good explanation if you ask me.  How about a different question?...  We recently changed cable providers. (I'm not so happy, but that's another story.) This new provider does a home 'gateway' arrangement. They put a frequency filter of some kind (i am assuming here) and use the home cable drops as an internal coax network.   The 'gateway' has a DVR in it and six tuners. it can record and pipe TV to more than one 'head' connected to the TVs.  The WiFi it has is crappy. It does not have the signal strength to get to the other side of our condo. (the 'gateway' is on 192.168.1.1) I added another router (Linksys WRT140N v3 which is based on 192.168.0.1) and the WiFi throughput is much better.  If the 'gateway' gets powered down and back up, the computers, tablets, and printers all seem to jump back to the 'gateway' WiFi and I have to manually reset them to the router's subnet.  Does that sound right to you? Can I fix that without having to give every device a static IP?"
TooAfraidToAsk,31a0z2,ghost_sanctum,11,Fri Apr 3 04:51:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think preferences are so cut and dry like that. Your preferences are constantly formed and changing. True, you're most easily affected as a child, but it doesn't stop there.   Take me for example: in the 6th grade I spent a lot of time with a slender, freckled, red headed girl. I had a pretty big crush on her, but I never acted on it. For the rest of my middle and high school careers, I was very attracted to redheads. All of the sudden, though, I met this very black girl, and my attractions did a 180. Now we've been dating for a year, and I don't even think about white women now.   That was a long way off saying that your preferences are always changing.   Preferences are also strongly based on cultural norms. Since Caucasian women are the unofficial standard of beauty here in America (seriously, every makeup commercial, most supermodels, even Viagra commercials are centered on white women) it stands to reason that you would be swayed in their favor.  I can't answer your question about Africans, but I don't think the evolutionary instinct is strong enough to discount a partner based on skin color."

It's also a matter of representation - think about all of the Hollywood stars right now. I can name three off the top of my head who aren't white - Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, and um...damn, what's her name, that Disney star - who aren't white, compared to dozens and dozens of white women.

I am not feeling well. Grace is home because she is unwell. I feel well now.  3) To return to 'well' within greetings, I believe ""I am well"" is either outdated, or simply uncommon. The expression sounds alien to me. Perhaps it's more commonly-spoken in places outside of Britain (my home country).

I'm not sure but if the FBI wanted to hack people who are using a VPN or Tor, acts of terrorism or terrorism related information is way up higher on the list of things than people buying drugs off a darknet market. No doubt the FBI/DEA have a focus on darknet markets but even then they're looking for the people running the site, vendors, especially the bulk vendors, and not so much people who are buying personal amounts of whatever it is you're into.  If you're using a VPN and Tor (obviously) to access a darknet to buy personal quantities of whatever, use PGP to encrypt your address and any other information you might message the vendor that you think is sensitive i.e. that could reveal your identity. VPN, Tor, PGP = happy times on darknet markets.  Also know that darknet markets are full of law enforcement (as they are here on reddit) pretending to be customers and buying dope to try and profile vendors. Watch what you say on the forums. FBI/DEA aren't stupid but sometimes you just get this gut feeling this guy you're messaging on a forum is LEO. Be careful, but as a customer don't over think it. And don't buy in bulk."

Now, imagine someone either lowers the jellies' refractivity function or increases the feedback looping grade; if you're lucky you'll get a phase instability eventually wearing down the piece, but you might also end up with a runaway current ondulation, leading to saturation in a few kilocycles. Most setups won't be able to handle the spectral pressure, and the unlucky operator will soon have to deal with supersonic debris.

Method 2: You can usually go to their website and download episodes in mp3 format and either listen on your computer or transfer it to any mp3 player or phone.   Method 3: You can download an app like Podcast Addict from the Play or App store, search for the podcast, and download it directly to your phone or tablet and listen that way. To find other apps, just search for ""podcast"" in the app/Play Store and more should come up.   Warning: Once you start finding podcasts you like, you may get addicted.

I was feeding MiniRaine3 a bottle with one hand, putting MiniRaine2's lunch in his back pack with the other, and trying to talk MiniRaine1 through how to tie his shoes.  He was on the phone with his boss talking about an early meeting.  That kiss? Felt pretty robotic.    Last night, MiniRaine1 fought bedtime for 30 min, MiniRaine3 was crying and wanted fed, and MiniRaine2 has a sinus infection and just wants held because he feels miserable.  Bedtime starts at 7:30 in our house, and last night it was 9:45 before all three were in their beds and asleep.  I came out of their room and shut the door and just leaned against his shoulder, exhausted.  He gave me a soft kiss on the lips and we went to bed ourselves (only to get up 2 hours later).  That kiss? Not at all sexual, but very comforting and intimate.  Last Saturday, Valentine's Day.  MiniRaine1, 2, and 3 were all at a church run parent's night out from 5-9pm.  We went out to dinner and had a few martinis.  After dinner, we went home to fold laundry and watch a movie (I know, sounds romantic, right?).

Others go on site investigations to determine the depth and spread of contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. Others review core data from oil and gas wells to locate zones of sand beneath the underground source of drinking water to identify safe locations for oil and gas companies to inject produced water. Still others review proposed well sites and try to identify potential adverse impacts on other existing wells. You could also be in charge of creating a model that predicts the water usage of a city and how long it'll take for the city to completely mine out its existing water supply if the city were growing at an unsustainable rate for the available groundwater.   A lot of time times, it involves using GIS to create maps to identify what's around the area you're interested in and using the available data to determine if the area iteself is interesting for future study and actual drilling and/or investigation."

(Major is your main focus). As you close out your undergrad studies, you would apply to grad school (or your university's grad program) for your master's/doctorate.

Basically, instead of taking random ass courses for your electives, you'd focus them in a certain area.  This could be related to your major, or it can be something completely different.  So, let's say you're engineering major.  You'd still take the courses needed for that degree, but for your electives, you could grab extra math classes or do some compsci work.  It makes you versatile and shows future employers that you're willing to go above and beyond the bare minimum, which is attractive, especially in a field like engineering.    I'd go chat with an academic advisor if you're uncertain about how you want to do things.  That's what they're there for! If you aren't already in college, just wait till you're enrolled and have an advisor help you schedule your classes.  There are no dumb questions there."
TooAfraidToAsk,2upeyj,tinydot,1 point,Wed Feb 4 08:56:20 2015 UTC,"Choose a school that offers the major you want and the degree you need for your filed. Most schools require some level of first year foundation courses. In many schools you may take those general classes first, possibly with some related to the major you want, then at the end of that year you 'declare a major'. That essentially means you fill out paperwork at the school checking off the desired major and then you take a certain set of classes to meet that end. In the foundation level you may have an academic advisor that tells you to take certain classes that are prerequisites for your major.  A minor is something optional but consider it as a separate major at the same time. Many schools offer minor options but you can talk to your advisor about it, and get used to the workload in general first.  When looking for a college speak to the administration, anyone you interview with about your plans to get a heads up about that department at their school. Even when you plan to go on to a masters, let your undergrad school know your plans and they can advise a good fit."

A major can give you a leg up if your school requires majors to, say, complete a thesis or a capstone project, but many schools don't do that, and graduate school admissions offices generally aren't going to care. Hook yourself up with faculty mentors in your area of interest, or speak with working professionals in the field to get a sense of the coursework that best prepared them to get where they are.

TooAfraidToAsk,2u9oo7,tightcaboose,2,Sun Feb 1 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"You get, a computer and all functions of a computer with the ability to play video games. A console is generally a dumb'd down version of a computer. It limits you to what the console creators want you to do. Which isn't a bad thing, it stop errors and issues. Still it has limitations, these limitations apply to everyone playing which helps deter hackers in-game. In terms of information hacking, there is less since it can only be used for gaming, a PC is used for a lot of things and has a lot of valuable information on it. This means hackers try harder to get to people on PC. You use a Computer though, so your information is at risk, just like your PSN or Xbox-Live. Your account might not be at risk, but that is due to Scammers, which is the downside to having such a vast and valuable community/market in Computer-gaming.  If you want mobility, a LAN box would be sufficient for you. You get somewhat of a mobility increase, marginally for an enthusiast level computer but for something that can play at console level, and/or even on a budget you could make it comparable to a console. In terms of size and somewhat in price.  For pricing, it is more expensive upfront. You aren't gonna buy a good gaming computer from dell or other manufacturing companies without either extremely overpaying or getting something not worth the value. Custom building is where you'll invest. This requires knowledge of building computers (which can be handled through hiring or finding someone who can build it for you) along with a higher investment for parts than for outright buying a console. This is really only due to the fact no one can mass produce the parts to make the computer as cheap as a company who builds consoles can/does. Still you'll make up your value.  How do you make up your value? Sales. When you move to PC you'll need to rebuy your console games and you won't have access to the few exclusive titles that exist which sucks. This is easily overlooked by the amount of games you get that aren't available to console gamers. From indie games to mmorpgs and console games that are either ported (GTA etc) or were made for both/exclusively PC. The game values are generally cheaper because they need a reason for people not to just pirate the game. Still when the games are full-priced you either wait for the game to go on sale, which happens pretty frequently (few times a year) or you wait till the price drops. (Just like a console game)  If you're looking for comfort, you can buy a wired controller, or a wireless hub for your Xbox one controller or Bluetooth receiver and Dual shock controller and use them with most games which are controller supported.   If you like style, then game communities and markets will offer purchasable ""hats"" or cosmetics.  Now for cheats/modifications, you get a lot out of this. I mean the replay value of games when they're modded is truly vast. I've logged in so many hours on skyrim on console, I bought it on PC in a pack and the amount of mods made me play hours upon hours upon hours with different starts, quests, everything really. Modding adds a lot, and some times creates the game itself (garry's mod) Console commands, are good for a lot of things; cheating, fixing issues/glitches, checking fps, ping. I mean a lot, depends on the game really.   For games coming out, they're getting more intensive sure. Still once they cap on the capabilities of Xbox one or PS4 etc you'll have to buy a new console. A PC gamer, will simply change parts which can be cheaper or more expensive depending on what they need. They can also future proof by purchasing parts well beyond the needs of current parts/games. This also extends to the idea that a PC gamer won't run out of space, since he can add more. A console gamer will have buy a bigger hard drive or an external one.  There really isn't much difference between a console and a computer. The part that stops people are either ignorance (idea one is better than the other), cost (both amount to a lot but the spending process is different i.e PC upfront investment followed by a substantial upgrade every few years or when a new part/gaming standard comes out. and console upfront investment whenever a next-gen comes out) and the last difference is the use. If you want to simply game, then a console is perfect for you and a simple laptop along with the console is all you need. If you want something that can be both a workstation/gaming rig then a Computer is your best bet.  If you get just a console, you'll also have to invest in a computer or laptop, since you can't use the console for school work etc. So you're technically paying for both a console and laptop when a PC gamer only needs to pay for his computer.  Again, I am not really gonna convince you. I was the first of my friend to switch to PC gaming, I had no one to play with and was worried it wouldn't be as good as a console which is designed to play games solely. Then I experienced the PC gaming world, the community, the games, the sales, the mods, and now I don't see a reason to go back to consoles.  Still the decision is yours, really think about what your console and a laptop does for you. Unless you want to shell out cash on a gaming laptop (which I personally have one and regret since I don't really need that kind of mobility but who knows you might?) or Stationary PC or LAN box (The sizes range from about an xbox to a little smaller than a typical PC; also note a LAN box is just a smaller computer case so you'll need the essentials along with it.)"

As long as you aren't handing out your passwords you have nothing to worry about.   Now why it's better than console. Way more games and for so much less. There are tons of high quality indi games that aren't on consoles not to mention all the mmo's. In adition to that strategy games are easy more fun to play on PC because of the easy of control.   Not to worry you can still plug in your wired controller and use it for games you prefer.   The price of games in a huge thing. Steam is great for that. And the original pirates bay IS back yup. And there are other torrent sites that are a lot better than tpb like kickass torrents. So you can test your games before you buy them ;).   There are a lot more positives I could probably point out,  but I'm not going to. Why, because I still prefer console. Why? Because I really enjoy laying down on the couch relaxing just playing through a game. The simplicity of a console and is what I love about it. No install, no hours of downloading updates.

I generally used it to discover new music (the only difference between a paid subscription and free is honestly that with paid, you can use the mobile app with no skip limit and without having a random shuffle, as well as ad-free on web browser). It's better, in a way, to figure out if you like a song enough to buy it. I normally listen to spotify when I'm on my computer and later buy/download the song on my phone.   Otherwise, there's not much to it honestly. It's unlimited music that you can listen to with unlimited shuffles and such, but it's like a radio.

TooAfraidToAsk,2s6qai,asker32y,17,Mon Jan 12 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I worked in a machine shop while at college; the machine shop was part of the university and catered to students for their projects and professors with their research.  One of my coworkers (who honestly had seniority over me) was a female mechanical engineering student and a darn good machinist.  It was a common occurrence for people to come into the shop needing help.  She would approach them and ask if there was anything she could help with and they would turn to a random dude working in the shop and ask if there were any employees available.  The idea that engineers and machinists are all men was so ingrained in most people's mind that they just couldn't fathom her mere existence as a female machinist so even after being directly approached for help with their project they would still rather ignore her and ask for help from someone else, just because that other person has a penis.   This was not an isolated event.  It would happen every couple of weeks or so, with different people.  This is far from being the only example of sexism that still exists in first world countries, but it serves as a nice illustration of what sexism can look like.  It's not stoning a woman because she was found to not be a virgin; it's not giving women the same respect as men when there's no good reason not to.  The demographics of my university's College of Engineering serve as a strong piece of evidence that somewhere along the way women are being discouraged from pursuing education and work in engineering which continues to be seen as a masculine field.  I suspect a nursing school would see the opposite demographics, as nursing is seen as a historically feminine field.  It doesn't take making everyone androgynous to fix this problem.  My former coworker was a very effective machinist and is now working as a very effective engineer while still being quite feminine (when she wants to be)—she was even in a sorority in college which is probably one of the least androgynous things you can do at that stage.  If people would stop assuming that men are better at math, science, and such things then my anecdote would not have happened.  This isn't the only way sexism can show up, but it's a big chunk of sexism that can be wiped out without everyone becoming androgynous."

The best magazines are the ones that go the non-gendered route, such as the New Yorker.

New Yorker is marketed to people like you who want to read about the world at large rather than see pictures about their interests (cars and decorating).

Marketers shape their ads according to what they notice in society because it's more profitable than trying to be ""different"" and proggressive.

We put different expectations upon our children force them into their gender roles. Why on earth would colours, toys and interests etc. be gender specific? I'm a guy with open minded parents that let me join in with my sister's doll playing, but I could never have done that in school. I believe domestic violence is a direct response of negative gender roles where the woman always has an overlaying expectation that she will take care of potential children and in some cases; give up her career to stay at home. A person with no career and without any income will face big difficulties leaving an abusive relationship, since (s)he depends on the partner. First world countries still contains sexism, try seeing stuff from the less fortunate's point of view, and the injustices will be easier discovered.  In my country, the feminist movement is a lot more directed to lbgt-acceptance and against the many prejudices that are held upon lbgt-people.   I had a neighbor that went trough a sex-change and I think it is awful how the rumors have gone on about her.

If I were you, I'd just look at the world around you and decide if sexism against women is a real issue or not.  A stranger on the internet can tell you whatever they want, but all they really have to offer is an individual account. And a lot of the time the people with the loudest voices are the ones with the most extreme opinions.  I think /u/gcubed makes a good explanation.  As for my personal opinion, I think radical feminists are simply wrong. There is some level of prejudice against women, but there is prejudice against any sort of category you can put someone into. It's impossible for me to fairly judge if a particular group is treated worse than others, and it's impossible for me to fairly judge if my experiences are because of widespread prejudice against a given group, coincidence, something personal, or any other form of explanation.

TooAfraidToAsk,2s6qai,Tain101,3,Wed Jan 14 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"There are studies that show bias towards any group of people. And often enough, people will extrapolate these studies to fuel their own beliefs. Which is why it's important to take your own perspective into account.  For example, the page you linked referred to studies showing that men talk more than women, that's the only actual fact they have 'evidence' supporting (I'm putting evidence in quotes because you linked to a reprint of a book, I'm trusting the book has direct refrences to these studies, but the link you provided just says they exist without giving any actual detail.) They used these studies to infer that:     ""The boys may therefore be asserting a claim to higher status than the girls by appropriating the majority of the time left for pupil talk."" ""This explanation proposes that men talk more than women in public, formal contexts because they perceive participating and verbally contributing in such contexts as an activity which enhances their status, and men seem to be more concerned with asserting status and power than women are."" ""women seem to use talk to develop personal relationships and maintain family connections and friendships more often than to make claims to status or to directly influence others in public contexts."" ""The explanation for the results seems to be that the women were being more cooperative than the men in a context where more talk was explicitly sought by the interviewer."" ""So feminist women were more likely to challenge traditional gender roles in interaction."" ""why girls in school tend to contribute less than boys. Why should they feel unconfident in the classroom?"" ""In other words, if women talk at all, this may be perceived as ‘too much’ by men who expect them to provide a silent, decorative background in many social contexts. This may sound outrageous, but think about how you react when precocious children dominate the talk at an adult party.""    Assuming, all of the studies claimed in the article were done, unbiasedly, and provided an accurate example of the world around them, everything I've quoted above is entirely opinion from the author. There is no actual evidence of sexism, there are assumptions. These studies could also argue that boys are feeling unwelcome in schools, and feel pressured to prove themselves, because if a man isn't able to contribute to society they have no inherent worth, while girls don't feel the pressure to contribute and feel welcome and valued regardless of participation. Or it could be purely biological, maybe men are born with a chemical balance that makes them more outgoing. I'd honestly be pretty surprised if less outgoing men had different results than women, or particularly outgoing women had different results than the men.  I am not trying to argue the reasons behind men talking more than women in school & other social settings, I am just trying to explain why I believe it's important to look at topics like this critically instead of believing other peoples word.  Hopefully this better explains how what I am suggesting is different from ""just give up and go with our gut reactions about people."""

The term may also refer to clitoral phimosis in women, whereby the clitoral hood cannot be retracted, limiting exposure of the glans clitoridis.   At birth, the foreskin is fused to the glans and is not retractable. Huntley et al. state that ""non-retractability can be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.""   Normal developmental non-retractability does not cause any problems. Phimosis is deemed pathological when it causes problems, such as difficulty urinating or performing common sexual functions. There are numerous causes of so-called pathological phimosis. Common treatments include steroid creams, manual stretching, changing masturbation habits, preputioplasty, and circumcision.

We called them Water Bugs.  Very rarely they would get inside, but it happened.  I've lived in a couple trailer parks that had ongoing roach infestations.  These were the little brown guys, and there was no way to get rid of them.  We would have had to get every person in the trailer park to have professionals come on the same day.  When we moved out, and into a doublewide on our own land, we had a few roaches here and there, but after spraying ourselves and washing everything that could have had eggs in/on it with strong chems, we didn't see any more, save for the occasional water bug.  I live in an apartment complex in Arizona now, and haven't even seen the outdoor guys.  I'd recommend that no matter where you live, you hire a professional exterminator.

No washing all your clothes and dishes and hoping that that loaf of bread was sealed tightly enough cause goddamnit paying for murdering the little uninvited bastards cost you enough as it is.

It's true that cold places have less roaches, but there's a bit more to it. I live in northern Florida. I THINK roaches also depend on where you are in the state and the type of house, not only the state.   I used to live in a shitty wooden house which was practically falling apart. Roaches would come around a few times every week, and I never got used to it. Spraying bug spray in every corner wouldn't do much.  Later, we moved to a brick house. It's practically completely sealed. The doors have those rubber bottoms, so things can't crawl in through the gap between the ground and bottom of the door. I have only seen one roach in it for two years, and it was dead in the corner.  My suggestion (assuming that you're planning on moving) to you would be to find a house or apartment with a very good build quality. As in, look around the walls and see if there are any openings that a creepy crawly could squeeze through. If it's good, you probably won't see any roaches inside. Before you actually move your stuff in, hire an exterminator to check for pest nests.  TL;DR - Cold places generally have less roaches, but if your house is built well (no gaps in the walls or doors) and you get an exterminator to check for nests you'll be fine."

An implicit bias is meant to be something you're not aware of, it's just a subconscious reciprocation of the environment you grew up in."

You'll find that in North America some people actively look for situations which might possibly maybe kind of look like racism if you ignore logic or common sense, and make the biggest fuss they can about it. The reason is because racism is a sensitive topic, so if everyone fears being called a racist because of the social stigma attached to the implication, then people will ""overcorrect"" to the benefit of the people alleging the racism for fear of being viewed as racist."

My perspective as a white male from a very white area, but now living in a very diverse area is that people are ass holes to each other.  There is no way for one to know why, so they assume it's because of their race because that's what they've been taught.    Besides this, for some reason, the role of the victim is given some sort of noble status in our culture.  It feeds into an already present innate sense of entitlement, but as a victim, it is given purpose.  For this reason, you'll find people find any reason to claim the victim status.  A good example for this season are those who are ""offended"" by ""Merry Christmas.""  That's what I think, anyway."

It's really heartbreaking to see so many comments here about ""crying racist."" I think that for somebody who has a hard time understanding the issue and is objectively interested in learning more, this article offers a great perspective on what white privilege is. From my perspective, I can understand why people can feel victimized when white privilege is pointed out or when they are accused of racism of which they do not feel that they are guilty. However, racism is an institution with tangible power structures that effect what most people consider normal and desirable. I think that piece hits the nail on the head when it mentions being able to make great achievements or accomplishments without being considered a credit to one's race. I really think that the root of the issue here is a much broader one than just race, and very clear parallels can be made regarding sexism and classism. Being defined as being part of a group that is outside of ""Normal"" or ""average"" comes with a whole bundle of assumptions that people make about your background and character, and facing these assumptions every day creates a lot of wear and tear on a person. It puts people on edge. It makes people think less of themselves. It makes people afraid of others, and it certainly makes some individuals hostile (as evidenced by some of these anecdotes). I also think that a lot of people confuse racism with hate. I think that the gun-toting lynchmob type of racist is a lot less common in the US today (although I am from a northeastern suburb, so I can't speak to that as accurately as others might). Most of the racists I've encountered are not hateful people, they just retain certain unfair expectations and judgments of people on the grounds of their race (or income, or gender, or sexuality, etc)."

In the second situation, it seems very likely to me that he was just going for the 6 kids instead of the 1, as you suggest. However, that's not to say that these kinds of interactions never have some racial element too. For example, black people often have trouble catching cabs in cities, though many speculate it's because black people tend to live in poorer parts of cities where the driver is less likely to be able to pick up another fare after dropping the customer off. It can be a sort of complicated situation in some instances in which both racist and non-racist (and logical business-minded) concerns come into play.   I will say that in general though, there's a fair amount of casual or implicit racism in the U.S. I'm a white guy from a nearly all-white suburban town who isn't a member of any minority group. It's pretty rare to see people openly say anything resembling ""I hate black/Asian/Jewish/etc... people"", but subtle comments and suggestions do happen fairly frequently when you're surrounded by mostly white people that are (at least visibly) middle class or higher.

I mean, duh, find me someone who would seriously argue otherwise.  But, that's not what you're talking about, is it?  You're talking about psychological attraction.  It's normal for mature adults to find immature adults WAAAY too immature if their goal is an equitable relationship.  It sounds like you're looking for psychological power: the need to be the one who gives or withholds approval, with your partner dependent upon you.  Honestly, that is some scary shit.  I suspect it doesn't come from being a bad person, so much as (for whatever reason) you needing to protect yourself from rejection.  You absolutely should talk this through in depth with someone you trust and respect and who isn't going to blackmail you with your deepest vulnerabilities and/or psychological dirty laundry.  It would really suck if these needs prevent you from forming healthy partnerships.   So my advice is yes, seek a mental health professional.

I cannot promise full correctnrss.     Theoretically, if you weigh a hard drive with zero data on it, that hasn't been formatted and all of the bits are empty, it would weigh sliiiiightly less than a full one, but not enough to be measured. In reality, the way hard drives are made (which involves allocating all of the memory for something iirc), it will not have ""empty"" bits everywhere so the answer is no."

There's also a fashion right now for using academic phrases outside of their typical use.   So, you see people use 'arguments' like ""Check your privilege"", or ""tone policing"" as argument-enders without actually engaging or trying to persuade. (And, mind you, not engaging or trying to persuade is okay- it's nobody's born job to do that- it's just once you start arguing with people, your choices are 'use an argument' or 'go to namecalling'.

Shaving can be a short term solution as /u/KixStar mentioned, but new hair growth after shaving tends to be rather sharp and abrasive. Also, farts will be different (assuming we are operating on the premise that girls do fart). Without ass hair, there is little to no space between your cheeks which leads to ""flappier"" farts if you aren't careful.

Look for a professional to talk to, some colleges offer a certain number of free counseling sessions, look for the little victories, things like getting out of bed at a reasonable time, going for a walk, having a good conversation with people instead of avoid them.  Most importantly what you are going through has happened to a lot of people who have come out of it better and stronger, and you can be one of those people, just remember you are not alone in this, don't be afraid to let people in.

It's not like ebay where you can just keep bidding and then you pay if you win. On sites like QuiBids, the actual act of bidding for the item costs money, regardless of if you win. That's how they make money.  Also for QuiBids specifically, they do some shady things like prices actually being in ""QuiBid Cash"" even though it looks like regular dollars."
TooAfraidToAsk,2lxuf0,Claidheamh_Righ,2,Tue Nov 11 06:30:26 2014 UTC,"So say if I bid $10 on an item. $10 will be deducted from my bank account, simply for bidding? And if I bid a second time at $15, that amount will be deducted again, leaving me with $25 deducted all together?"
TooAfraidToAsk,2lxuf0,Claidheamh_Righ,6,Tue Nov 11 07:12:10 2014 UTC,"No, each bid will cost a certain, small amount. In the case of QuiBids, you bid in amounts of QuiBuids pennies, usually in small increments like 5 pennies which is how these sites work, the more bis that have to be made before they reach the end, the more money they make. A QuiBuid penny will cost you 60 cents of real money.  If you're wondering if it's worth trying to buy something from there, no it's not. It sounds great because the prices they display are in QuiBids Dollars (which are 60 USD each) and because the cost of bidding to the end isn't made clear."

TooAfraidToAsk,2lxuf0,neo-1989,2,Tue Nov 11 13:02:47 2014 UTC,"Pretty much. She paid $50, plus the cost of each bid she placed throughout the auction. (Although there may be some cases where free bids are given out, I looked at the site years ago)   So if she bid 100 times (at 60c each), she spent $60 on bidding, plus $50 for the tv.  Depending on the tv, that could still be 80% off retail price.   The item would probably have well over 1000 bids placed on the site though, totalling $600. Which is where they profit."

Many only go up by one penny per bid so it is very tempting to just keep bidding."

The graphical increases are primarily down to a higher resolution and higher resolution textures. The base geometry of the game, as well as the code, will remain the same for the most part.  Examples of this are shown when games such as Fallout/Skyrim/GTAIV have all received significant graphical mods since releases. These mods do not remake the game but instead replace assets already in the game with better looking and higher detailed replacements. Other enhancements such as draw distance increases similarly do not require the base code to be rewritten."

TooAfraidToAsk,2jkvkt,hearty394,12,Sat Oct 18 03:34:54 2014 UTC,"If we go back far enough into the history of the words and the practices, we find that religion and cults are essentially synonymous. For example, in Ancient Greece, we find the worship of certain gods and goddesses in a location being called the ""Cult of Dionysus"" or some such styling. Cult comes from the Latin occultus meaning darkened, covered, or hidden.  Most religions of the ancient world had some level of secrecy to them, in which those initiated into the cult learned secret names and practices. This didn't carry any of the negative modern connotations: In fact both Mithraism and Christianity can properly be called cults in their early days as the followers met in secret and performed ""occult"" ritual.  Religion comes from the Latin word meaning to bind or tie together. So, in Ancient Rome, for example, the state ""religion"" was really a collection of cultic and open practices of binding people to the gods. The Romans had a very contractual philosophy of religion, and perceived their religion as being a kind of binding agreement between heaven and earth.  NOW, what you really want to know is when religion got the good connotation and cults got the bad one. Well, the Romans of the early Empire allowed conquered people to retain their old religions, as long as they formally accepted the Imperial Cult of worshipping the Emperor. They got a few hundred years practice with imposing this official religion, kicking the Jews out of Judaea when they refused, for example, but it wasn't until the 4th century that shit got real.  Christianity had propagated memetically throughout the empire, but there were many versions of the one, true faith. Once Rome starts heading toward adopting Christianity as its official religion, it must come up with ONE accepted story for what Christianity was. Enter the Council of Nicaea in 323 CE. At this council, lines were drawn, and if you believed in something divergent, you were officially a heretic. Those who tried to preserve their old beliefs had to do so in secret, in a cult.  So that's it, really. A religion is a cult big enough to establish itself and claim to be true, and have others accept that claim. Religions work out in the open. Cults must hide because they lack the ""too-big-to-fail"" criterion. This is why we see so much argument about things like Scientology; Hubbard realized he could work backwards, and just make his cult look official, and then it would become a religion."

TooAfraidToAsk,2jkvkt,Tookah45,3,Sat Oct 18 21:32:03 2014 UTC,"One of the main differences could be the number of followers. Most religions start as a cult.

TooAfraidToAsk,2jkvkt,taykaz,2,Thu Oct 23 03:48:17 2014 UTC,"I suspect the line is when the group tries to cut people off from their families, or requires participants to make significant financial or time contributions to the group.  Examples I'm just making up here:    a religion may ask you to attend services for 1 hour per week. A cult may ask you to attend services for 3 hours a day a religion may ask you to tithe 10% of your income to the religion or to the poor. A cult may ask you to turn over your checks to them and pay you a stipend a religion may ask you to ask your friends to come with you to services. A cult may ask you to cut off all ties to people who are not also part of the cult   I think the line is less fine and more distinct than you say. It's definitely an interesting question that I've thought about as well.

Order each one separately, ordering another when you've finished the current drink. This is probably the most normal way to do it, as you might leave after one, or two, or the third. After the first one, you know what they cost, so you lay the appropriate amount of funds down to cover your newest order.  Order one pint, and pay for two more, telling the bartender to give you a refill when you're empty. This might be an acceptable way to do it when you're in a hurry, drinking fast, and don't want to wait for a tab .... say you're waiting on a call or a flight and a delay in paying might put you in a bind.    Trust me, bartenders have seen it all at one time or another, and as long as you're polite to them and give them no reason to think that you're doing something to queer their business, are cool with just about anything."

I'll start off by acknowledging, no, I'm not very good at parallel parking, but I know how you can get better.  Assuming you are in the states, I would recommend visiting the DMV for practice.  Where I live, they close around 5:00 P.M. and don't open Sundays.  When they are not open, you can practice on the cones or wood barriers they have set up.  Of course, check with your DMW for their schedule.    Secondly, if you can, contact a driving school.  You can probably get the hang of parallel parking in two, or maybe just one lesson, since you already have driving experience.  Look online or in a phone book to contact one and explain your situation and I'm sure they will be glad to give you lessons.  They will probably even let you practice on a car that they own before you learn on yours.  Lastly, if you can't contact the DMV or get a lesson, I guess just use YouTube.  I'm sure that there are plenty of videos for all types of vehicles.    Good luck! I hope this was helpful!"

The pressure of finding an all too rare spot, with angry drivers backed up behind you, doing it quick and getting it right...  What helped is thinking how it works. You're going in ass first, with wheels that don't turn. You got to get them into the spot, with the rear wheels going in as close to the curb as you can get them. You can then pivot the front wheels to slide in the front. If you don't get the rear wheels close to the curb on the first go, it's very difficult to maneuver (in a tight space) to get the car close to the curb.   Also, if you pull in the front wheels and find you're pretty damn far from the curb, it's best to start over again.  There's just no maneuverability.   Think of one of those carts whose only the rear wheels pivot, and the front wheels only go straight..."

What would be the point of an ad displaying such somewhat old-fashioned stereotypes? Remember that the point of commercials isn't to please, but to make an impression, ideally one that would last for more than a few minutes.   Why did they chose a drag dresser, a naked woman in bed with her kid, the creepy old man with the girl and the two dudes with the masks?   In most European countries none of these things would be particularily provocative or offensive in this context. They are a bit out of the ordinary, sure, but that is part of the idea behind the ad. The somewhat dark atmosphere shown plays along with the characters' stories of their questionable exploits, setting an air of seriousness and making the characters appear rather alien to the viewer. This is the feeling building up through most of the ad, but that narrative is then broken down when it is revealed that it's about a gaming console. All those non-ordinary people are simply relating the rather ordinary experience of playing games. This brings them back on level with the viewer, thus communicating the promise that the product is capable of giving the viewer similar excitement."

We really don't have the ad culture you guys seem to have over there (speaking for  UK at least here), people would not stand for it and I don't get how you guys can put up with so much n your face ad's everywhere.

Usually mixtapes are just a bunch of tracks from like minded people put together on a cd to get their name out there. Albums are more for somebody who is already somewhat known and it showcases all of there main songs onto 1 cd. Think of it like mixtapes are like a sample pack of artists and once you have decided on one you like you could buy their album if it is available because it is mainly all that persons songs that will be on the album.

TooAfraidToAsk,2fzlz0,duggtodeath,2,Wed Sep 10 17:41:29 2014 UTC,Honestly... some of it is completely  psychological. If put in a group of people you will observe how attractive they are... or aren't and will then rate yourself in your own mind. Of course others can help this self perception. For instance  say all the girls in your class want to date you. That would lead you to believe  you are attractive. On the contrary say the opposite  sex pays you no attention. You might believe  you are ugly. It's all relative.
TooAfraidToAsk,2fzlz0,taykaz,2,Wed Sep 10 13:10:16 2014 UTC,Attractiveness is extremely relative. Or do you mean in general? Because even then it's relative. It's personal preference. You really shouldn't worry about it at all. Everyone is beautiful in their own way.
TooAfraidToAsk,2fzlz0,jayriley,2,Fri Sep 19 04:15:43 2014 UTC,"The word ""attractive"" is the key. If you are attractive, people are attracted to you, so that is your yardstick. If attractive, you probably are generally received well. People smile when you approach. The opposite sex are interested in you.   If you are not attractive, well, the opposite happens. You have a harder time bringing people into your life, all other things such as personality or wealth being equal.   Average means you probably have even features, decent bone structure, no major skin problems, reasonably up-to-date flattering hairstyle, no wild facial hair including eyebrows, and practice good grooming. You have some flaws, like a nose that's too big or eyes too small, but overall it's not a train wreck, and you look nice when you smile. I'm only considering the face but obviously the body is a factor, too.  Below average means uneven features, poor bone structure (such as craggy nose, flat wide cheeks, weak chin) and not enough of the qualities above. So acne, bad hair, don't practice good grooming, and weird smile or bad teeth.   Above average includes all or most of the average qualities, with something extra. Impeccable skin. Eyes that are large and of unusual color. Full lips. A bright, wide smile. And here is where grooming and style are most important. A hairstyle goes a long way in communicating whether you are average or above.   Studies have shown (sorry, no time to find source) that women tend to underestimate their level of attractiveness and men overestimate."

Most people who end up in the hospital attempting to OD on pills would have succeeded had they not been found.  There's also a tolerance issue.  People who have access to pills commonly used for suicide--vicodon, oxy, etc--tend to have prescriptions for them.  That means they use them frequently or at least more frequently than the average person.  Means they have a somewhat higher tolerance.

TooAfraidToAsk,2fatfn,mr-mumbai,15,Tue Sep 2 22:10:32 2014 UTC,You shouldn't do that because there is a trap just below.  It could potentially get stuck there and the maintenance guy or plumber will know what's up.  After that it should go to the same place as everything else
TooAfraidToAsk,2fatfn,mrnoonan81,2,Tue Sep 2 22:41:47 2014 UTC,"I'm not a plumber by any means, just a homeowner, but I think I can say with confidence that all liquids will make it to the very same drain pipe as all the rest of the waste water in the house.  It will likely join the same pipe as the toilet not even 5 feet away.  The trap is simply a U shaped section of pipe.  It is designed to keep sewer gasses (read stink) from coming out.  The last bit of water stays in there and keeps the drainpipe blocked off.  Sometimes seldom used drains' traps dry up and the room starts to stink.  Pouring a small amount of water down the drain will fill the trap and stop the smell.  So, if you urinate while you take a shower, it will likely be flushed away with the water, but if you urinate in the shower with no water running, that trap will be filled with urine until it's flushed and it may smell.  The reason poo might get caught is because it can be denser than water and sink to the bottom of the trap.  This is why sometimes a handyman can rescue a ring that was lost down the drain.  Toilets work in a very similar way, but because it's flushed with gallons of water all at once, it's usually enough to flush the poo away."

An S-shaped trap is also known as the S-bend invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. The bend is used to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings. In refinery applications, it also prevents hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases from escaping outside through drains.    Image i - Water seal in drain pipe under a sink.

There are a few nuances here:   There is no single entity that employs most blind people for the sake of ""employing blind people."" The word ""blind"" has both a familiar usage--i.e., unable to see--and a legal definition. I can't speak for other countries, but here in the United States, a person with a range of 20/200 or less which is not correctable is considered legally blind. I myself fit this criterion. Yes, I can see--I walk without a cane or a dog; I can read regular print; I'm using Reddit pretty much just like everyone else here, with no more adaptation than good old Firefox's Ctrl+F feature for increasing the text size a bit--but I also cannot legally operate a motor vehicle, etc., and professional baseball is probably not a good career choice for me either. Just like anyone else, those who are ""blind"" (regardless of whether we're talking about the legal or familiar definition of the term) have a range of abilities and disabilities which may effect whether, where, and how they work. Obviously there aren't a hell of a lot of blind taxi drivers or airline pilots, but many can and do work in fields such as IT, customer service, education, child care, etc. I myself work in an IT department for a county government, doing a mixture of programming and clerical work. However, some visually impaired people end up in workshop programs, because either there is a lack of other employment opportunities or they have other severe disabilities preventing them from working in ""mainstream"" jobs.   tl;dr -- It depends on what you mean."

TooAfraidToAsk,2f4fyt,autumnusvale,17,Sun Aug 31 23:32:17 2014 UTC,"First off, you don't need to apologize for asking a question in good faith. Asking a civil question to try to better understand is just about as far from bigotry and ignorance as you can get.   As far as I can tell, I identify as a male because I have male genitalia.   Available evidence suggests that this is not the case. On the more trivial side, I could point out that if you lost your penis in an accident tomorrow, I doubt you'd suddenly stop identifying as a man. But we have more elaborate case studies.  Men who experience hormone reversals, usually as a treatment for prostate cancer, show a variety of negative effects. Post-menopausal women often seek out hormone replacement - in fact, they take the exact same estrogen pills I do. Needing a mastectomy to treat breast cancer is usually viewed as a very distressing thing, and surgical interventions are common in cases of gynecomastia in men. These are all examples where, with reasonable regularity, a cis (that is, not trans) person experiences something akin to gender dysphoria.  The most spectacular case study available is the (tragic) case of David Reimer. Reimer was born male, and after a botched circumcision at 10 months a psychologist realized that here was a perfect opportunity to test exactly this hypothesis. They constructed female genitals, and Reimer was placed on female hormones and raised as a girl. He was depressed and ill-adjusted for most of his childhood, and transitioned to male immediately upon learning of his history in his early teens. In short, he behaved typically for a trans man (that is, someone who transitions from female to male).  As best we can tell, gender identity is at least partially determined by brain structure formed very early in fetal development. A few studies show patterns typical of our identified gender and not of our birth sex. Moreover, transgenderism correlates strongly with endocrine conditions - if we look at people born with externally female bodies, those with PCOS (which raises testosterone) are much more likely to ultimately identify as men; those with CAIS (which makes their bodies incapable of responding to testosterone) almost never do, to the point that single cases merited publication in their own right.   I would be comfortable never referring to myself as one gender or another if that were culturally possible.   Gender roles are part of, but not all of, gender. You might be comfortable (for instance) not playing football, but would you be happy if you woke up with breasts tomorrow?   So my supposition is that most cisgender people identify with being male or female out of default due to their genitalia   Most people are told by their parents - ""you're a boy"" or ""you're a girl"". Little kids don't, in general, have detailed knowledge of genitalia until someone tells them about it.   I feel like it could just be that, like strongly identified cis people, they identify strongly with cultural gender expectations (but the ones of the gender opposite their assigned gender). Or is there something more ineffable inside them than just checking a bunch of boxes in the column of the culturally defined opposite gender? Something that can't be explained? Or is it just different for each trans person, and therefore silly to even ask?   It can be any and either of those, or a mixture of them. Speaking for myself, I was not especially distressed by having a male body in terms of just going through my day. I wasn't happy about how I looked, something I just wrote off as being because I was overweight, and I could never see myself taking a male role sexually. But the idea of having a female body was exciting and - well, have you ever seen a little kid on the day before they go to Disney or whatever? It was like that.  I also do identify with some more culturally-normative aspects of femininity. I like skirts and pink, and I've allowed myself to be much more emotive and expressive as a girl than I was as a boy. While these are cultural constructs, that does not make them meaningless, and the reality is that expectations are placed on people based on their sex. I don't particularly want to retrain my voice, but to live any sort of normal life that's a practical necessity.    You may want to pop over to /r/asktransgender and read a bit to get an idea of how different people experience their feelings, or you can read a wall of text I wrote up last night about my own history."

I will definitely read your wall of text and haunt /r/asktransgender some. While I learned a lot from your response, both about transgender issues and myself.

Learning this stuff can be very humbling... and if you're as proud as I am, it can feel like a punch in the gut when you realize how little you knew or how wrong you have been.  Your points about genitalia are well-taken, and your points about hormone therapy and surgery for something similar to gender dysphoria are, too.  For the record, I am going to wake up with breasts tomorrow! I do have gynecomastia (possibly due to a medication I took as a teenager) and while I don't feel like my identity is somehow compromised by having breasts, I can see how it's totally valid someone would feel that way, and furthermore, I do worry about negative treatment due to other people's perception of me due to having breasts. And as you say, just because their perception is based on a cultural construct doesn't make it meaningless. Part of me really wishes I didn't have to be typed as either male or female but I would think twice about giving up dat sweet male privilege. Which makes your pursuit of identity all the more amazing to me -- you're making some significant sacrifices to gain a sense of wholeness. Give up something and gain everything. It's a beautiful paradox.  And on that note I think your excitement/Disney analogy was what helped me most with my question. Because whatever cultural or hormonal substrate underlies the issue, it's really about that thrill of allowing oneself to be oneself and become whole.

When we look at other people we see their eyes move and shift to meet our gaze.

We always see our own mirrored eyes staring straight at us, which is very different from the way we experience anyone else's gaze.

TooAfraidToAsk,2el6b3,blablalalabla,19,Tue Aug 26 01:54:35 2014 UTC,"The short answer is: no, it does not make you racist.  People might think that you're racist, though, because they assume that your intentions couldn't possibly be pure. While there are, throughout history, examples of people darkening their skin in order to portray a negative stereotype of a particular race, that in no way whatsoever means that anyone who darkens their skin to portray someone of a different ethnicity must also be doing so to portray a negative stereotype.  That would be as if I were to say that anyone sporting a toothbrush moustache is a supporter of Adolf Hitler, when they could just as easily be wearing it because they love Charlie Chaplin.  Yes, people used to do it for racist reasons, but it's the intention that makes it racist rather than the act.  The problem is that there are so many people who are unwilling or unable to see past it, and so in nearly every instance of someone darkening their skin to honour someone of a different ethnicity the term 'racism' gets very liberally thrown around.  If you want to do it to honour and celebrate someone of a different ethnicity, that most definitely does not make you a racist. Just don't expect everyone you meet to see it the same way, because while in an ideal world they'd understand, realistically it will at the very least be seen as insensitive by many."

The sides of the moustache are vertical rather than tapered. The style first became popular in the United States in the late 19th century, from where it spread to Germany and elsewhere, reaching a height of popularity in the inter-war years before becoming unfashionable after World War II due to its association with Adolf Hitler. Other names for the moustache include the Hitler, Charlie Chaplin, 1/3, philtrum, postage stamp, and soul stache.    Image i - Oliver Hardy (right) sported a toothbrush moustache.

They have lots of experience that tells them, people who darken their skin for a costume are going to be racist.   I'm going to be a little more complicated now:  When you create a costume, you are creating a text for others to read.  And they are going to put your text in the context of other texts that are similar to it, and they are going to use that context to read your costume; not only is that fair of them, it's literally the only way they can make sense of your costume.   Now for people familiar with the character you're putting on, they'll use that context as part of their reading, but there have also been a lot of people who have darkened their skin as part of a costume for a racist performance and that's your context too.

They song songs that make you feel powerful, because they talk about not giving a crap about what people think of you, just living your life the way that makes you happy and bending the rules of what's acceptable.  The combination of that, plus they actually (at least publicly) live the words they sing is really inspiring to youth culture, and to the gay community.   During puberty, when most teens are figuring out their first ideas of their sexual identity, the message they send is 'It's ok to be different'. It's okay if you're a guy and like to sew- you don't have to grow up and be a banker if your heart is in fashion, even if it's against traditional gender roles.  It's like, hey, if Lady Gaga can go outside without pants, and Madonna can publish a BDSM coffee table book, then I can go follow my dreams and desires too.  If they did it and were accepted, then I can do it too!    It should also be mentioned that the subject of their songs not only includes ideas of self acceptance, but being sexually free.  Personally I feel as though a bisexual r homosexual person, or one who has had to come to terms with themselves sexually somehow, is more likely to enjoy music that is sexually free because they are naturally more comfortable with their own sexuality.

The Dinobots group consists of several subgroups of robots, each of whose transformed mode is that of a dinosaur or similar prehistoric animal.  Dinobots are referred to as Dinotrons in the Japanese version, and Dinobots (ダイノボット, Dainobotto ?) in the Japanese dub of Transformers Animated.

The immune system of animals is remarkably good at killing fungi.  Unless you were severely immunocompromised (late-stage AIDS, preparing for a complete bone-marrow transplant, that sort of thing) this isn't a significant risk.  There are three fungal lung infections endemic to the US.  Blastomycosis is actually dangerous, but it only infects humans rarely.  Histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis are both common, but usually don't cause symptoms.  Combined with another disease, they are similar to pneumonia or TB.  Overall the risk is quite low.  TB kills about 500 Americans per year, blastomycosis only a few in isolated outbreaks.  This is usually the result of clearing infected land, stirring up spores.  Human-to-human transmission is possible but extremely rare, only a few cases are known.  For what it's worth, these fungi are similar to yeast and mold.  They don't produce mushrooms."

TooAfraidToAsk,2ckc5t,Quendalon,2,Mon Aug 4 15:22:37 2014 UTC,"Do you mean ""Why is pedophilia considered a mental illness while homosexuality is not?"". Again the criteria is harmfulness to the self or others. Human minds experience a lot of variations and are not accountable to any standard of ""normality"" in scientific terms. If someone deviates from what is considered ""normal"" by social standards but the deviation is harmless then it is not an illness. If it causes symptoms that are uncontrollable or very difficult to control and thereby causes potential harm to self or others, then it is labelled a mental illness. That's where the ""ill"" in illness comes from. If a child is born with purple hair, he/she is not ill, merely has a mutation with no harmful effects. If a child is born with a congenital heart defect, then he/she is ill. You carry in your body a number of microorganisms that have no positive or harmful effect, (like we all do) but that does not make you ill or infected. If you add the Ebola virus (or any other pathogen with harmful effects) to that rooster, then illness may arise. If you are afraid of dogs but you can control your fear when you need to, then you are not ill. If you panic for no reason when you see a dog you may have a phobia. As you see the standard is the same for physical and mental illness and it not a matter of ""political correctness"" to call one a mental illness and the other not."

TooAfraidToAsk,2bbkx1,whatsaphoto,14,Mon Jul 21 19:12:24 2014 UTC,"Congrats on the new job.  The biggest rules for office etiquette are basically the same as for life. Don't cause a scene, don't be obnoxious, don't create a visual or auditory distraction. Don't slurp your soup/coffee, don't play your music too loud (if you are allowed music in your space), don't hang things in your space that might be offensive to others. Don't gossip about coworkers, don't put people down, even as a joke. Be positive about things, not negative - even things like movies, music, etc. If you don't like something, don't rant about it. Don't assume that everybody will automatically like you, no matter how popular you've been elsewhere. Cute guys/girls are not just there to flirt with. Do not flirt with anyone before you get to know them.  Remember that you are the low man on the totem pole, and everyone else there knows more about how the office runs than you do. Even if you think you have an awesome idea for improving how things work, keep it to yourself for a bit - there may very well be a reason things are done in a way that doesn't make sense at first. Don't question your boss, even if you think you have a better way something can be done. Always do it their way first; maybe later you can improve the process.  Be helpful, but not obnoxious about helping everyone. Hold doors for people. Smile when you see someone you don't know. Be upbeat. If the job seems to be a drag after a few days, do your best not to show it at work. Take it to your friends/significant other, don't bitch about work at work (even if someone else is doing it).  Don't horn in on conversations, even casual ones. Well, maybe you can - you have to play that one by ear. Leave things the way you found them; clean up your messes, remove the used pod from the Kuerig coffee maker - if you have a regular old brew-a-pot system, never take the last cup without setting up another. Label your lunch in the fridge, and don't leave leftovers unless you absolutely plan to eat them the next day.  Above all, I think, remember that you and everyone there is there to work. If you become friendly with people, don't let it interfere with getting the work done. And have fun!"

My husband has the same fetish as you, and I'll admit I thought it was weird when he first suggested it. I was pregnant at the time, and wasn't lactating (most women only have colostrum, not milk, when pregnant). I thought it was weird, because it was kinda sexualizing a part of motherhood. We aren't super kinky or anything, but we are very open with each other- I've certainly suggested weird stuff he's turned down, or said yes to and vise versa. But this seemed too far!   After I had the baby though I changed my mind. I was willing to try it. Honestly summarizing my thoughts at the time would take longer than I have, but the basic idea is that I got used to breastfeeding and seeing my breasts as both sexual and maternal. The body has all kinds of purposes, I'm reminded of the pick up line ""damn girl, you shit with that ass?"" I grew to sort of embrace that, over time.   Anyway it really wasn't weird when we did it. It honestly was barely sexual, like you said it was very intimate. It's an important ritual with us now, something we do at the end of the day, something to connect us. Sometimes it's sexual, usually it isn't. Not sure how common it is, we've never told friends about it. According to him it's a popular fetish, but does that correspond to lots of women liking it? If you can communicate with your partner though, everything is possible. I've tried all sorts of things I never thought I would because of my husband, from breast feeding him to the Wire (also really good). You fill in each other's blind spots.   I don't know about inducing it though. How does that even work? I imagine most women won't want to take hormones or w/e to make it happen without pregnancy, but maybe you'll find a special woman."

However, that's not to say a kind of proxy war won't occur. US funding the Ukraine, and Russia funding the Crimea.  If your question is actually relating to if there was a WWIII in the future, what would the likely alliances be, the alliances would reflect already existing alliances.  NATO / Anglosphere: US + EU + Australia + New Zealand + Canada.  SCO: China, Russia and company. That ain't gonna happen until Russia and China actually have the ability to go to war with US, which is a long way away. Give it another 30-60 years and maybe.

Israel exited the Gaza Strip but today has turned it in to the largest open prison holding 1.5million people under inhumane blockade and siege. Israel continues to gradually land grab and steal more and more internationally recognised palestinian land in the West Bank. Gradually it will steal all of the West Bank as it did to the Golan Heights (Israeli Occupied Syrian Territory). Palestine is supported by more countries than Israel which in truth was born from Zionist Terrorism which hijacked all things Jewish and the Jewish Plight and inspite of Religion, Tradition and Law, went about decietfully aquiring a land which already had a people. Palestine was a land of Muslims, Christians and Jews, of Arab Ishmaelite and Jewish Israelites and For centurys they lived together in peace. That was until western Imperialist fed the diseased idea of nationalism to Jews in Europe and fed that same crap to the Arabs living under the Islamic Caliphate which once streached from the Gates of Europe to China and in it's last chapter was under the Guardianship of the Seljuk Turkish Dynasty of the House of Uthman (Ottoman). The West made contradictory promises to both Jews n Arabs and both fell for it despite the fact that Nationalism goes against Jewish and Islamic teachings. Today those stupid Arab nationalist have evolved in to freakin disgraceful Arab regimes and Israels birth and acts to survive would make the victims of the Holocaust turn n scream in their graves.  The problem is not race, ethnicity or Religion.. Those have been issues of unity and peace in days of old.  The Problem Is and Always has Been: Human Stupidity, Greed, Nationalism and Ignorance.

Right after WWII the competing groups struggled for influence.  The Israeli Jews seeing an opportunity, declared a Nation (Israel) and took measures to cement its foundation.  The ""Arabs"" in the region objected. They decided to fight Israel's existence in 1948 and lost.  They tried again in 1956 and 1967 and 1973.

The idea is by the end of your sublease you'll be familiar enough with the city to decide what area you want to live in permanently.   Obviously get a job first. You can't live somewhere without income!  Spend the first few days establishing yourself. Buy toiletries and essentials. Find the closest grocery store, pharmacy, restaurants, bar, etc.   Start meeting people within the first week. It's amazing how lonely even an introvert can get when you have absolutely no one to talk to.   And then explore as much as you can! Go hiking, walk around, try some restaurants.

Your first problem that you need to understand is, that if you are going to hit someone then you need to be prepared to severely injure them, if you are not ready to put someone in the hospital, or even kill them, then you have no real reason to fight. I you are being threatened with any form form of bodily harm, then the last thing you need to worry about is what happens to the person threatening you, yes there will be consequences latter, but it's better to be judged by twelve than carried by six. This is also why violence is always a last resort, I can not stress this enough to you. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO AVOID VIOLENCE. You new to understand that anything you do that involves physical violence can, and will more than likely escalate. If you throw a punch that successfully knocks someone don, the punch itself may cause barely any damage but their head hitting something when they fall could be lethal. A punch to the gut could seriously harm someone you didn't know was Asthmatic. I really hope you understand this. Know. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to fight with your bear hands DO NOT AIM FOR THE HEAD. The human head is very small in comparison to the rest of the body, and a very difficult target, to make things worse the forehead, the largest, and there for most likely place for your fist to land is also the hardest part of the human body. If you hit somebody here you with a bare fist you will most likely just piss them of and break your fingers. Feel the first knuckles of your index and middle fingers, this is what you will be striking with when you throw a punch. On the other hand the human torso is the largest part of the body,, and has some of its softest, spots making it a much better target for punches. Your much more likely to stop an attacker with six solid blows to the torso than twelve glances on the head. Being hit in places like the solar plexus( the v of the to cage where it meets the gut), floating ribs, and gut can easily leave someone winded, or in enough pain for you to try to get out of there safely, if you still can't get out of the situation you will now at least have an advantage this is the time where you should knock the person over; and stomp on them, hit them on the back of the head, try break a limb, or best find something to use as a weapon. I hope you never have to use this advice but again I'm going to beg you to do your best to avoid violence I'm the first place, because fights can always escalate, and there's always a good Chance that someone will get the best of you before you them."

TooAfraidToAsk,2aje0t,CalmYourVag,2,Sun Jul 13 18:00:06 2014 UTC,"Realistically, without training, pretty much anything stated in this thread will go out the window.  Nevertheless, if you did go and get training, you'll be told a few things:   Avoid the fight if possible; without sounding like this is Skyrim, your voice can be a surprisingly effective tool if used powerfully and confidently. Otherwise, only use necessary and reasonable force; if they pose a serious threat to your life, you have the legal ability to respond with a similar threat. If they end up in a wheelchair and you go to court, that will still be better than being dead. Remember too that while you might think it's a fist fight, unless you really know that person, you don't know if they're armed, and it could very easily turn into a fight with improvised weapons that could very easily result in fatality. A knife or other sharp object stabbing certain arteries can stop your heart in a few seconds and render you unconscious in about half that time. Never underestimate the power of a knife. If you are striking another person, do so with palm strikes to prevent damaging / breaking your hand / wrist. If you get really close, there's also elbows which are a lot harder to damage when striking; assuming you can keep up a guard whilst that close however. Also, it should be noted that a palm strike is probably less likely to kill, as it would be harder to fracture their temple, destroy their eye, etc. A good percentage of fights; possibly the majority of them, end up on the ground; don't let yourself get on the bottom and make sure you constantly protect yourself. On the topic of the ground as well, a lot of fight fatalities happen when a person goes unconscious or stumbles, and then hits their head on a hard surface.   tl;dr  Do everything to prevent a fight; use your voice to scare them off, etc, if necessary, use palm strikes, somehow try to fight over a soft surface like grass, and try not to let them hit the ground unconscious."

That bone is close enough and sharp enough to cut the skin when hit. The blood will drain into his eye and he'll get the message. You'll also probably give him a black eye.

If you wear them because being a cross dresser is your thing, (again, its a little unusual but nothing to be embarrassed about) then do a ""Hey big sis, you mind if I borrow some of your clothes?

TooAfraidToAsk,2a0w3s,bigDean636,6,Wed Jul 9 14:18:16 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing my previous comments got caught in the spam filter. So here's another try without the links:  How cautious do you want to be?  With regard to stripping, ""camming"" on sites like MyFreeCams or chaturbate seems to be relatively common. the barrier to entry is relatively low, but over time you might want to invest in better lighting, cameras and toys.  As far as privacy goes, I know that you can restrict access to certain regions (for example no one from your state would see your profile), but that isn't foolproof. Another option would be to wear a mask, I've seen some models do this, but it is uncommon.  I would guess that the probability of someone you know randomly finding you is low, but not zero.  Panty selling seems a lot easier, usually you will only need still photos, so you can just select angles which don't show your face. If you are really cautious, I would also take care to hide unique tattoos, posters in your room, etc...  As far as I can tell, it should be possible to send out envelopes without a return address, so that could be done anonymously.   You might want to take a look at /r/pantyselling, to get an idea for how it works and what prices you can expect.  As far as attractiveness goes, I have no idea what to expect from a 6/10, but in my experience your personality is almost as important as your looks.  If you are ""bubbly"", quirky, interesting or engaging, you will have a lot more success. Many people tipping on cam sites don't just want to see a naked woman, that's what recorded porn is for (with better angles, lighting, etc). The interactive experience is the unique feature.  One rather successful cam girl has the option for people to tip her to put on or take of silly hats, or to mute her. I've seen her on cam wearing 12 hats and being annoyed at someone, but she couldn't talk because she was muted. That was both adorable and interesting to watch. And far more fun than just seeing some random stranger frigging herself off."

""For example, the distribution of onsets of seven female lifeguards was scattered at the beginning of the summer, but after 3 months spent together, the onset of all seven cycles fell within a 4-day period.""   Martha McClintock's 1971 paper, published in Nature, says that menstrual cycle synchronization happens when the menstrual cycle onsets of two women or more women become closer together in time than they were several months earlier.  Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to cause synchronization.   After the initial studies, several papers were published reporting methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony including McClintock's study. In addition, other studies were published that failed to find synchrony. The proposed mechanisms have also received scientific criticism. A 2013 review of menstrual synchrony concluded that menstrual synchrony is doubtful.

I think imperialism is the main reason why people are dominated by ""light skinned"" countries is because of the early industrialisation that they had. The quick manufacturing of weapons would mean that other nations that has not the technology were at a severe disadvantage.  The development of transportation technology, especially sea-based technology, such as ships, were made possible because of the numerous waterways that encouraged these developments.   In the case of Japan, as it is a lighter skinned country, the Japanese interacted with the Portuguese (or was it Dutch?), and welcomed them into the country. For the most part they adopted the technologies that offered by the Dutch. They did close their ports to other European countries and, because of their location in the world, their isolation afforded them more time to industrialise and emerge as a New Imperialist super power. (Japan, USA, Germany, as opposed to just Britain)  If you think about it, Africa was torn apart by the European countries. They did not have an industrialisation so they had to fight the French, Dutch, British, Portuguese with limited weapons. In fact, these nations had a meeting on who would get what from Africa, as if they owned Africa. It's called the Berlin Conference.  In all, industrialisation and imperialism is what allowed nations to separate into ""first world"" countries and ""third world"" countries."

That being said, if there is, objectively, a higher number of shootings in recent history, it could be due to fact that the media, in trying to keep our attention, creates a sensation out of the news and it penetrates our culture, effectively creating a school shooting fad.  That's a theory based on the condition that there are actually more shootings lately.  I don't have the facts to say there are or aren't."

TooAfraidToAsk,27hs4j,ravia,2,Fri Aug 1 15:39:17 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of people in a lot of pain and want to lash out in anger. It's like a blister waiting to pop. Some are copycats, true, but the real root is the condition of these shooters. Aside from some who work themselves up into a state somewhat artificially, through paranoid beliefs, which is also a bit of a ""drug"" or ""high"", there are many who are in intense psychic pain.   Add to this that they experience this as a generalized thing. They become ""mad at the world"", or some sub-portion of the world (e.g., cops, or fellow students). This generalization is a kind of infantilism.   However, there are plenty of people who experience a similar, somewhat infantile ""oceanic"" experience of the world, but they are just happy, so they don't lash out. Many of them would also lash out if things went south. They accept their generalized experience without question, even thought they know it is somewhat ill-grounded. They know perfectly well it might not work out so well for some others, but pass that off and expect the victims of the unhappy + violence-prone others to be a collateral damage with which they are happy. Along with that collateral damage, they are content with the victims of that infantilism who do not hurt anyone else, but simply suffer on their own, and perhaps also commit suicide.  If you feel happy and know very well that things might easily have not gone very well for you, you're just depending on collateral damage and the suffering of others for your happiness. Many just want to cash their happiness in and you'd better get out of the way. Certainly such people don't want anyone questioning them. But you can do the math pretty easily: look at some happy people you know and ask yourself, ""now, does this person really seem like the kind of person who really gives a fuck about anyone else? People who really are different, people who have difficult histories or circumstances, etc.? Honestly?"" Most of the time, this is a very good indicator of where they stand on the unhappy sort of people in their world.   Just get out of their way and pray you never become that collateral damage, I guess..."

TooAfraidToAsk,26qsav,whatsaphoto,10,Thu May 29 00:15:56 2014 UTC,Russia was one of our allies during WWII. As such they are not shown in much negative light till they become our enemies during the Cold War.
TooAfraidToAsk,26qsav,cdb03b,2,Thu May 29 00:26:53 2014 UTC,"I know this is an old post, but it seemed worth answering.  Before WWII: Anti-communist sentiment in the US was present but limited.  The American public was in a major isolationist period.  Presidents Coolidge and Hoover reflected this.  Roosevelt didn't so much, but was limited by what the public thought.  Some probably viewed Stalin's purges of political figures as ""communists killing communists"".  The future role of the Soviet Union in world affairs is uncertain, suggesting a certain caution for US diplomacy.  Soviet society is very closed, limiting the spread of negative news.  During WWII: The Soviet Union was a US ally, if an uneasy one.  US propaganda aggressively targets Germany and Japan, painting them in the most negative light possible.  Although aspects of the Holocaust were known during the war, the sheer scale and inhumanity of it is not fully realized until the Allies begin freeing prison camps toward the end of the war.  This is captured in graphic images that are distributed widely with the express purpose of showing how horrific Nazi atrocities were.  After WWII: There is a major US-led effort to publicly vilify Third Reich leadership, leading to the Nuremberg trials.  Hitler is dead by this point.  After the war, the US-Soviet relationship quickly falls apart.  US propaganda efforts begin targeting the USSR and anti-communist sentiment quickly goes out of control.  By this point Soviet society is very closed; the phrase ""Iron Curtain"" is often associated with comments Winston Churchill made shortly after the war, although it was in use prior to that.  The closed nature of Soviet society and the extensive control of the media by the Soviet government means that Stalin's executions and prison camps are difficult for us to observe.  Photographic evidence is redacted to remove the very existence of some executed people.  Many are sent to the middle of Siberia where they die slow, isolated deaths.  We often don't know of Soviet government crimes until long after they occur, sometimes not until after the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s (long after Stalin's death).  There is another dimension to this also.  US history textbooks tend to portray a somewhat whitewashed version of US history, of a nation that can do no wrong (or when it does, quickly fixes it).  It is hard to reconcile that narrative with our wartime alliance with a dictator that murdered millions of his own people.  Hitler, Stalin, and Mao all killed lots of their own people, yet the way US foreign policy handled each was very different.  The political situation leading up to WWII is fairly complicated, and it can be hard to convey why we did what we did."

The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit. In surveys of American consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70% of respondents prefer over.   While many people consider this topic unimportant, some hold strong opinions on the matter. Advice columnist Ann Landers said that the subject was the most controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, the ease of detaching individual squares, and compatibility with a recreational vehicle or a cat. Celebrities are found on both sides. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy; and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.

When you just randomly approach someone you don't usually talk to at school or work or wherever, they will likely (and most often correctly) assume you want something. Think about it. That guy you know the name of, but don't ever talk to. He comes up to you, and introduces himself. Now, I don't know you, but I can almost guarantee that your first thought is, even if it's not in a ""I want to get out of this as quick as possible"" kind of way; ""What does this guy want that has caused him to start talking to me?""  As such, just walking up to someone is... well, it doesn't always work. my suggestion would be to wait for your friend to talk to her again, then walk over, and introduce yourself with something like ""Hey friends name. /turn to girl. You're girls name, right? I'm /u/Iamurcouch. Good to meet you. How're you doing?"" Then go from there.  The exception to the thing about not just walking up to people is usually parties. People are there to have fun, they're usually a lot more relaxed, and I can tell you from experience, if you just walk up to a person (doesn't even have to be a girl) and say ""Hey! I'm /u/Iamurcouch! What's your name?"" They will talk to you. Especially if they're drunk. Drunk people fucking love talking to people."

It's not uncommon for women to poop during birth and also not uncommon for vaginas to need stitching afterward. So poop to genital wound contact is not unheard of and there are procedures to minimize the risk of bacteremia (and resulting sepsis) in any modern maternal ward. Most cases of sepsis happen in medical settings due to secondary infections after surgeries.  Symptoms would be an elevated heart rate (tachycardia), either a high (fever) or low temperature (hypothermia), rapid breathing (>20 breaths per minute or a reduced PaCO2 level), or a white blood cell count that is either high, low, or composed of >10% band (immature) cells. You have to be careful about self-diagnosing rapid breathing/rapid heart rate since these are nervous responses, if you're afraid of being sick then naturally your heart rate and breathing will be faster...Symptoms should show up within 24 hours.  That being said, you should go to the doctor, sepsis isn't something you want to wait around to happen. I'm sure s/he will be understanding because, like I said, your situation isn't entirely unheard of in the medical world. All that's going to happen at this point (before symptoms are present/if early symptoms are present) is that s/he will likely prescribe an ointment to use on your wound and antibiotics which you can take at home. Most people who see a doctor early make a full recovery. If you wait for an infection then you will likely need to be hospitalized. I understand if you're in America and don't really have the money to see a doctor, but trust me going to a urgent care place or your GP and getting antibiotics will be MUCH cheaper than having to go into emergency care. Even if your blood is clean, you really ought to get something for your vagina, genital wounds are particularly prone to infection. Hope everything works out!"

TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,throwaway65956,10,Thu May 15 21:55:58 2014 UTC,"I'll take a stab at this.    Rape is pretty terrible because it puts the victim in a position of utter powerlessness over something that should be one of the basic things people have control over. It's usually really traumatic and can fuck people up big time.  Yes, there can be physical ""pleasure"". Your body is designed to react certain ways to certain stimuli, so if you stimulate a person's genitals for long enough it's possible that it can lead to orgasm regardless of how mentally not-into-it they are.  Piggybacking off of answer number two- if you stimulate a guy's dick for long enough, he may very well become physically aroused even though he isn't okay with you touching him. As a lady, I don't know firsthand how much control men actually have of their penises, but I would imagine it's sort of like when they get hard ons they'd rather not have.  I haven't really heard of any instances where rapists are called worse than murderers by the media- could you provide some examples? I could see an argument being made that rape is something that could really change the rest of a person's life for the worse, and that they'll have to spend the rest of their life dealing with. You don't really have to 'get over' being murdered. So worse in that sense maybe? The majority of murders are one time things. Most people who kill others do it in the heat of the moment or by accident and are very unlikely to ever kill anyone again. Rape on the other hand, is usually something that the rapist has a taste for. (S)he is usually a threat to others as long as (s)he is free, so we feel that we need to warn the public.  Romeo and Juliet laws allow underage people to have sex with each other providing they are within a certain age of each other. Each state has its own set of laws dictating what ages are okay.  There are tons of reasons for this one. Pick your fave!   I hope this helps!"

TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,britsonlydrinktea,6,Fri May 16 00:02:21 2014 UTC,"I feel like you aren't getting full answers to your third bullet point, so I'm just going to address that:   You mention that men can be raped but seem fuzzy on what that looks like.    There are a lot of horrible ways to rape a man, but just to start with, when a man is anally penetrated against his will, he's being raped; his penis has nothing to do with it.    Similarly there's forced oral copulation.   There's also rape by coercion, meaning he's threatened with something unless he performs.  Then there's rape by deception, where a man is tricked into sex with someone.  This one is complicated but basically he thinks it's he wants to sleep with, but he's been tricked.  He didn't knowingly consent to sex with that person.    Then there's rape through intoxication, basically the dude is drugged by another party, especially without his knowledge or even against his will.  Then, even in a direct physical confrontation, a guy can sometimes get an erection.     So that's a pretty horrible list, but the key take away is that anything that happens without knowing consent is rape."
TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,notreallyahugger,2,Fri May 16 06:07:47 2014 UTC,Also erections are controlled at local spinal level ie you don't require conscious input to have an erection.

TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,gralt,6,Fri Aug 8 21:28:39 2014 UTC,"Hello, female rape survivor here. I'll see what I can answer from your above questions. (Also thank you for the trigger warning. It helps me navigate through the internet and only click when I'm emotionally ready. I know that labeling things with trigger warnings has become a hot topic recently, and I want to tell you how much I appreciate them!)  1) It is bad because during the attack (how I generally refer to what happened to me) I had zero control over what was happening to my body in the most intimate places. There is a lot of fear for bodily safety, and also the emotional torment because I knew my attacker... he was my boyfriend at the time. I view it as unforgivable because sex is an opportunity to be incredibly vulnerable; for someone to take advantage of it and forcibly take it instead of being a partner in a consensual hook-up is pretty despicable. It is also bad because it leaves life-long memories that can lead to some pretty damaging consequences- just like anything else that is traumatic.  2) I had zero pleasure during the attack. There was a lot of pain and panicking. I was trying to wrestle him off me and saying ""no"" and ""stop"" repeatedly. I started to feel claustrophobic inside my own body.  3) Other redditors have answered this. This isn't really my realm.  4) Occasionally I wonder this as well. When I was in the depths of depression following the attack I wished he had killed me instead because at least that way I wouldn't have the flashbacks, nightmares, and panic attacks.   5/6) Not sure about the legal questions.  7) -Rape is taboo because the people who most need to talk about it are the victims and their supporters. However rape survivors are often blamed for the attack. Personally, I didn't want to talk about it because I felt very broken for becoming a statistic.   -Each rape survivor feels differently about their experience. Often, they may think that theirs wasn't a ""real"" rape or ""as bad"" as someone else's. And because of this, they don't want to say anything, even if they need help.  -It is also hard because I often needed to talk about when I had sexual difficulty in the relationships following, and no one likes talking about sexual dysfunction.   -Rape survivors also don't really like talking about what happened to them because it is deeply personal. It is also something that changes you and your identity in a way that only other survivors understand.   -People minimize the crime and it makes all of the issues we face seem melodramatic (the people who say ""that test raped me"" completely minimize everything I have experienced regarding the rape.)  Also, just another note: I refer to people who have been raped as survivors. This is for several reasons: in violent rapes those people can also be murdered, post-attack many have deep depression and suicide ideation, for those that press charges they need to survive the legal system and rape-kit sampling, and we are not just ""victims"" of a crime, we are continuing to live life despite a horrific disturbance.   I'd be open to answering any other questions. You seem to be very respectful in the way you ask."

TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,DownvoteBrigade80,3,Sat Aug 23 21:58:29 2014 UTC,"Might as well throw in some info:   its essentially torture, and considering how sex is connected to so much and very ""deep rooted"" it can mess people up on a pretty fundamental level It is possible.  Orgasm especially is a reflex reaction, you can't fully control it and in a lot of cases rape victims will ""zone out"" during the attack as a sort of defense.  I can't find the link but there was an AMA with a rape counselor that said ~3/4 of women they counseled had orgasms during their rapes, this of course is probably skewed since those who do have an orgasm are probably more likely to need counseling. Any guy who's had a hard on during gym class (that is, all of them) can attest to the fact that no, you can't really.  Running with even a semi can be extremely uncomfortable, and whats worse is that the uncomfortable rubbing tends to make the problem worse, not better. Torture and disregard for a person... Normally, a murder as some personal aspect to it that, as screwed up as it may be, you might be able to sympathize with... As above, murders usually do it to a specific target.  While rapists might target specific people, the rape itself is the instigating factor, not the person (murder typically goes from knowing the person to then committing the crime, not interest in committing the crime leading to knowing a person).  Because of this they are less likely to seek out someone to repeat the crime. These cases are terrible... Mostly because someone ends up taking the blame and then ends up on a sex offender registry for the rest of their lives. Sex is a taboo topic, activity, etc.  This further complicates things"
TooAfraidToAsk,25nuh3,irrerivan,2,Fri May 16 01:05:45 2014 UTC,"i am no expert on the matter so i answer what i can:   Why is it so bad? Like why do people call it heinous and unforgivable    it's psychological torture some people get over it, some suffer their whole live being unable to get intimate or trusting other people. it's the feeling of being powerless and the fear it might happen again. imagine a woman that was raped getting flashbacks to it while trying to get intimate with her partner   is there any pleasure?    rape is more about control, rapists are mostly (always?) loosers or aggressive people that want to feel powerful, like they ""own"" someone   I know rape can happen to men aswell, are men not in control of their penis?   yes, i am a guy and i wake up every morning with a ""hard on"" the penis gets erect when you are aroused but also from time to time just because (its a blood circulation thing) so it can happen to men who are, say, blackout drunk, but it would be pretty hard to get an erection on gunpoint, not impossible though."

TooAfraidToAsk,25o0ae,originalusername132,1 point,Thu May 15 22:58:12 2014 UTC,"That's entirely up to you. There's a few options available. It is often required that you do get your hair washed either at home or before the hair cut as clean hair is far easier to cut than greasy hair. It's also far less painful.  If you're going to a barber's, then they aren't likely to provide the option of washing your hair for you before you get it cut, so in that particular case I would recommend washing it yourself (but you'd only really be going there if you are male).  Now if you are going to a hair salon, there is a bit more variation available:-  You can wash your hair beforehand, and request a dry hair cut.  You can go without washing you hair, and request a wash and wet cut. There is also the added option of having them dry it for you at this stage as well.  And finally you can wash your hair beforehand, get it washed again there, and then request a wet cut. And then again the option of having it dried is available.  Furthermore, after this you can ask to have your hair styled. I believe this last step is offered in both barbers and hair dressers.  As for washing your hair afterwards, that is entirely personal preference. I personally do, as I do not have my hair styled at the hair dressers, and often am left itchy from tiny bits of hair that has somehow found its way down under my clothing. Getting a shower and a change of clothes after a hair cut is very relaxing for me, solely due to how stressed I get from being so itchy."

TooAfraidToAsk,25b0fv,SuperiorGyri,9,Mon May 12 11:41:16 2014 UTC,"Frankly, I think it's because most beauty pageants are in effect pageants for white girls. In the rare cases that non-white people win (like this year's Miss America), they tend to a) be fairly 'white-looking' ethnic people, and b) subsequently get harassed, insulted, bombarded with death threats, and accused of ~playing the race card. Separate ethnic pageants then serve the purpose of not only giving non-white people a chance to win and celebrate their own standards of beauty, but also to letting them do so without the abuse that would usually come with that.   It's a bit like having a gay pride, and then having a straight person complain about there not being a straight pride day. To which any gay person will reply something along the lines of 'yeah, no, that's because every day is already straight pride day.' Or with /r/TwoXChromosomes not being happy about becoming a default sub, because they liked being a safe space where women could give their opinions frankly, without men coming in and telling them how they're all wrong about their experiences as women.   Now, does an underprivileged white girl have the resources to go on the beauty pageant circuit by herself? Probably not any more than an underprivileged ethnic kid, and that sucks, so organizing a community event for them sounds like a great idea. But since non-specified beauty pageants are generally assumed to be white-dominated already, specifying 'just white girls' (who already have the majority of events catering to them) is just a cunty thing to do, especially with the United States' history of segregation and how ethnic minorities are still largely disadvantaged."

These parents don't hate white kids, they just want to make their child feel pretty among more people that look like themselves.  A white girl doesn't grow up thinking Asian women or Black women are more attractive than she is, it's just not a reality, it's not a mindset reinforced by American life nor the media, and you already know a black girl isn't going to win at a pageant where pretty much everyone else is white, and if she did people would say it was only out of pity, the reason it's racist to throw an all white pageant is because there is no non-racist reason to do so.

In my observations, it seems that black culture, especially lower class in urban environments, tends to not be concerned with stranger's judgement as much as other sub-cultures do. I see a lot of black teenagers on the bus talking very loudly, I see lots of black people having loud phone conversations (the stereotype of a black guy answering his phone in a movie would probably fit into this category, although I've never had that happen personally) , and when I see large groups of black people waiting at bus stops, they tend to be louder in general than your average crop of non-blacks*.  So, to answer your question, my guess is that it's a combination of that element of culture combined with the fact that an older man taking the bus is probably not living the life of his dreams and probably just gives less of a fuck than, say, an older black man driving his own car. I know this doesn't offer any solution, but just hopefully some insight.  *Disclaimer: I live in a pretty segregated city, so the line between black culture and lower-class urban culture is often blurred. I'm not racist and firmly believe that a persons' race does not dictate who they will be. But where they are born does. They're not poor and uneducated because they are black; they are just poor and uneducated, and because of the social-geography of the United States, many of them happen to be black.  edit: ALSO, just food for thought, you're probably taking the confirmation bias into account here as well. By that I mean you're not thinking about all the older black men that DON'T hit on you, just the few that do."

TooAfraidToAsk,248n6v,wollphilie,2,Tue Apr 29 22:05:32 2014 UTC,"I think there's two main reasons for this in Germany.   First, these laws stem from the time of the occupation, and the Allies really wanted to drive their point home -- that they'd rightfully won, but also that something like the holocaust should never happen again. An atrocity like this is something most people gladly would've liked to sweep under the rug and forget about, so instating legal consequences for people who publicly go 'holocaust? what holocaust?' is a pretty smart way of showing everyone who's boss.  Also, at least around here, we still have a pretty upsetting number of neo-nazis. While their party or their sub-organizations can't be forbidden outright just because they're nazis (cause that would be unconstitutional, and that's a good thing!), still having the laws against holocaust denial and demagogy in general means they have to walk a pretty fine line rhetorically or they will get in trouble for demagogy, plus nazi demonstrations (which have to be allowed because of free speech, which is also a good thing, although not very pleasant to be around) have a very limited array of symbols they're allowed to display, which in turn makes it harder for them to make an ~impact.   Producing evidence to the contrary will only change the opinion of someone who doesn't have anything at stake by changing their mind, and that's not the case for most ideological issues. Not only because of your self-image, but also because there's often a social aspect to it. The nazi party is very clever about targeting young people along the eastern borders in poor villages where there's fuck-all to do apart from hanging around the local youth club that just happens to be sponsored by the NPD, so people who slip into that mindset risk being set apart from a peer group that, more often than not, has a reputation for violence. And believe me, just because there's overwhelming evidence for the holocaust to have happened, it's amazing what 'evidence' the other side will and can produce. Just like with climate change, or evolution.  Plus I think, in Germany at least, there's still an element of 'well, but my grandpa wasn't a bad person!' to why some people are still susceptible to the NPD party line."

If something is offensive to one race of people, then the inverse can be seen as legitimately offensive to another race.   Racism isn't about 'oppressed' races or any of that bullshit. It's when people are making negative, stereotypical, derogatory, whatever remarks about a race in general, or about a person purely based on their race.  But that doesn't mean you should get offended by it. People making fun of white guys for not being great dancers? Not particularly funny, is certainly racist, but isn't worth kicking up a fuss.   The idea that you can be excluded from discussing racism because of your race is ludicrous and hypocritical."

If I decide I don't care, I don't think it's anyone else's place to be offended for me.   By that same token, if someone refers to all hispanics as Mexicans, it should be determined by the general consensus of the group as a whole, not outraged or decidedly not outraged people of other races.  As a white man, I think you get to decide what is offensive/racist to the groups you belong to.

Switching positions isn't at all mandatory (apart from 'logistical' shifting around after giving each other oral, obviously), and 'plain' missionary sex is a lot more common in a private setting than it is in porn, mostly because it sort of obscures all the squishy parts.   Porn is about what looks good for an audience, sex is generally about what feels good for the participants.   Very few women just come from someone sticking their dick into them -- the clit is where it's at. Very few men have a ten-inch penis and the ability to fuck their partner up against the wall for an extended period of time. Getting spunk in your eyes hurts like all fuck. Giving oral can be more fun than getting oral. Jackhammering can be great or lead to a bruised cervix, depending on the situation. Enthusiastic consent is the best kind of consent.

My advice would be to try to talk to each other, and don't rush anything.   Girls find sex much more pleasurable and they are better able to cum if they are aroused (""wet""). Foreplay is great, and foreplay doesn't need to be just about the girl.

Chances are, whatever she's going on at you about is only a small part of what's bothering her, and you, as her boyfriend, are just the closest thing that she can vent at.  Just sack up and take it with your mouth shut, because if you argue, no matter what you say, she's going to take that as you saying that she has no right to feel what she's feeling, or that she's stupid, etc, and that will get her really and truly angry at YOU specifically, and that is NEVER fun.  Just let her do her thing and keep your fucking mouth shut because there's nothing you can say that won't get you into real trouble.  Just wait until after she calms down (never, EVER tell her to calm down, because when you say ""calm down,"" what she hears is ""you're being stupid and irrational.""), and when she does, two things will probably happen:   You can discuss the issue like adults.  THIS is the time to make your case for yourself, NOT when she's going off.  Ask her what else is bothering her, because I guarantee, what you did to set her off is probably only the spark that lit the fire.  Just listen, and reassure her that you support her completely. She will probably feel really bad for going off on you, and will want to apologize and ""make it up to you.""   People's relationships go to hell because one or both parties is more focused on themselves than their partner.

TooAfraidToAsk,22t1yp,BmWalker93,31,Fri Apr 11 20:45:38 2014 UTC,In real life or as it applies to reddit? Real life just a bunch of guys sitting in a circle giving the guy next to him a hand job.   As far as reddit goes it's because how how the site is setup. It's divided into very specific subreddits and due to this you have a large group of people in these subreddits who all share generally the same idea. Due to this when some subreddits try to have a discussion or debate it's nothing but people who agree with each other patting themselves on the back telling them how smart they all are. There's no dissenting opinions or different sides to the debate and if there is it's heavily downvoted. This is what is generally called a circlejerk because everyone is just telling each other how great and smart they are basically.   As neutral example as I can think of off the top of my head is someone posts to r/aww a news story about science confirms that looking at pictures of cute things reduces risk from everything from cancer to the common cold. Top comments talk about how right the article is giving random confirmation bias about how they always knew this to be true. While the bottom of the list in the negative would be people questioning the authenticity of the news article or pointing out that the headline is a bit misleading. This would be circlejerk.

Source of fluid of article  Female ejaculation:       One very practical objection relates to the reported volumes ejaculated since this fluid must be stored somewhere in the pelvis, of which the urinary bladder is the largest source. The actual volume of the para-urethral tissue is quite small. By comparison, male ejaculate varies from 0.2–6.6 ml (0.01–0.22 US fl oz) (95% confidence interval), with a maximum of 13 ml (0.44 US fl oz).  Therefore claims of larger amounts of ejaculate are likely to contain at least some amount of urine. The eleven specimens analyzed by Goldberg in 1983,  ranged from 3–15 ml (0.1–0.5 US fl oz).  One source states that Skene's glands are capable of excreting 30–50 ml (1–2 US fl oz) in 30–50 seconds,  but it is unclear how this was measured and has not been confirmed. One approach is to use a chemical like methylene blue so that any urinary component can be detected.  Belzer showed that in one woman he studied, the dye was found in her urine, but not her orgasmic expulsion.  Some studies have described the fluid as a diluted form of urine, without the presence of Ammonia.

Even if there are no sperm, you still have most of the other components being secreted. There are no other cells besides sperm specifically secreted, however in the process of secretion, I would think that at least some amount of epithelial cells get stripped off the walls of those organs and ducts and the urethra as it is pushed through.

Wall of Text Coming  However, I will explain why people don't do as you're saying. There are several issues with your scenario here.  First issue: good job right out of college is not a reasonable expectation right now. A turbulent economy, a huge supply of people with degrees and competition is fierce. Quite a few people with expensive, great degrees are working at Starbucks and Walmart because it's better to have a job as opposed to no job.  Either way, assuming a person DOES get that good job right out of college, there are other things getting in the way of your savings plan there. You state a minimalist apartment, which is a nice idea but not always easy to find, especially in an area where people start off making 50k like that.   Then there are things like: health insurance, car insurance, a car or public transport costs, car wear and tear and maintenance, food, emergency expenses. And this is assuming everything runs smoothly in their life and nothing happens to them that interrupts their ability to work. Break your leg? Can't work for awhile, that's money lost. Get hurt and need an ambulance ride? Not covered by insurance usually, can cost thousands so there goes your emergency fund.   Another thing: the salary going up 3k a year is kinda unlikely right now. Raises are not a common occurrence anymore, so I wouldn't be so quick to add that to the equation, it's just not realistic.  There there is student loan debt. That's a whole 'nother ball game that can cost some people $200-400 a month.  Food costs vary and yeah, you can live on the basics there. You also probably wouldn't get to go out and have much of a social life if you are really trying to save a ton of money.  I really wish your idea was as simple IRL as you made it out to be because I wouldn't be in my current position if it was. It's just that I feel these days it's not a realistic concept.  TL;DR: I wish you were right."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,cleverpseudoname,6,Sun Mar 23 16:50:05 2014 UTC,"Quite a few medical jobs pay a shitload right out of school. I'm specifically looking at biomedical engineering currently. Entry-level wage for them is $45-50k a year, and it goes up pretty quickly. Since you were wondering what job would pay that to what is practically a college student.  But other than that, thanks for the reply. I guess it makes sense right now. It's not impossible, but a lot of variables make it highly improbable that one might be able to do this."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,cleverpseudoname,10,Sun Mar 23 17:11:43 2014 UTC,"Medical, yeah, but look at that debt you're facing, and you said right out of college but that is based off the assumption that a degree is a guaranteed job right out of the box.   But enough about that, the question asked was ""why don't more people do this"" and the answer could easily be ""because not everyone is leaving college with a degree in biomedical engineering"" and if they did then the competition would surge and the difficulty of finding said job right out of college would increase dramatically, so it'd be a moot point. Basically not everyone gets to start out in the adult world with such a good starting point as a job making 50K so that is why more people don't do like you said. And again, getting the job is one tiny part of the equation, so it's still not highly probable. Shit happens, things get in the way, emergencies occur that obliterate your savings if you have any, etc. You have to plan for the worst and hope for the best, even if you are leaving college with a desirable degree in a usually high paying field. That is half the reason we see so many people in their early-to-mid twenties still living with their parents.  I used to work at Walmart. They had a remodel being done on the place and there was a temporary worker there with two PhDs, and no, they weren't in Philosophy and Underwater Basket Weaving. Degrees are far from guarantees. I used to have that thought process when I was younger but then suddenly I'm 25 and reality hit. My bf is 35 and is still struggling, and he works his ass off. It's just not so cut and dry as I wish life was.  So no, still not highly probable, but I really really wish it was. I really do."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,arianw21,1 point,Sun Mar 23 17:23:55 2014 UTC,What if there's no debt? I'm in my 3rd year of college right now with no debt.
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,cleverpseudoname,5,Sun Mar 23 22:12:58 2014 UTC,"Ok, so you lack student loan debt and leave college and immediately land a job paying 50k and live in area where you can find a relatively cheap apartment, you have no pets, you use public transportation, you eat ramen for a majority of your meals, you are in incredibly good health with little risk of illness beyond the cold and flu... all of these factors fall into place, then yeah, it's entirely within the realm of possibility. It's just that in most cases, a few of those things don't happen or it at the very least takes awhile. It's not that you shouldn't aim for that or try to save your money like that, it's that you can't expect everyone to be able to do the same because of all these variables. It's great to avoid adding any student loan debt to the mix because I can speak from experience that it makes even the better situation so much harder.  So to sum all this up: if the stars align, it's not a crazy idea on its own. It is, however, crazy to assume its a simple thing that everyone can do, because life doesn't work that way. Congrats on keeping out of debt like that, btw.  EDIT: Sorry for sounding like an asshole. My bad."

If you don't name at least this much coming out of college as an engineer, you fucked up.   First issue: good job right out of college is not a reasonable expectation right now.   It is if you network during college, pursue an employable degree, and do internships.   especially in an area where people start off making 50k like that.    It's not the area, it's the degree and the experience and the job.   Then there are things like: health insurance, car insurance, a car or public transport costs, car wear and tear and maintenance, food, emergency expenses.   You are correct.    And this is assuming everything runs smoothly in their life and nothing happens to them that interrupts their ability to work. Break your leg? Can't work for awhile, that's money lost.   Everywhere I've worked, an hourly (Manish labor) employee goes on disability in this instance. Most salary jobs aren't affected by this.   Another thing: the salary going up 3k a year is kinda unlikely right now. Raises are not a common occurrence anymore, so I wouldn't be so quick to add that to the equation, it's just not realistic.   Most people I know who have engineering degrees and perform well get a 2-5% raise annually, more if they change jobs.   There there is student loan debt. That's a whole 'nother ball game that can cost some people $200-400 a month.   It costs a lot of people a lot more than that, actually.   Food costs vary and yeah, you can live on the basics there. You also probably wouldn't get to go out and have much of a social life if you are really trying to save a ton of money.   Yup, gotta find that balance.   I really wish your idea was as simple IRL as you made it out to be because I wouldn't be in my current position if it was. It's just that I feel these days it's not a realistic concept.   It definitely is, if you get the right degree and are willing to sacrifice eating out, going to bars, living in a nice apartment/house, owning a nice car, etc."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,PhysicalStuff,6,Sun Mar 23 22:25:13 2014 UTC,"Imagine there are two of you, named Q and W.  Q does as you suggest and puts aside something like 10 % of his income per year (which is quite a bit, considering other expenses, such as surviving), while living in a small rented apartment and spending as little as possible. After a few decades he'll have enough for the solid down payment on a nice house, even considering that property prices have gone up quite a bit during that time. Q now owns a home and doesn't have a whole lot of dept, though he still owes more than he owns.  Now, W, rather than saving, chooses to take out a loan and purchase a house soon after he lands his first stable job. After a few decades, at the time when Q moves in to his new house, W still has some dept left, but a good chunk of it has been paid off. Also, since the value of W's home has risen quite a bit since he took out the loan, he could, should he wish to, sell the house, pay off his depts, and still have quite a bit left for himself. In other words, W owns more than he owes.  So, it seems that in the W is better of than Q financially, and he got to live in his nice house for a few extra decades."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,wonderloss,5,Mon Mar 24 00:04:28 2014 UTC,"If Q makes a bigger downpayment, he will end up with either a better house, or better interest and a lower payment. He will most likely end up paying less for the house over the course of the loan than W. The increase in home value is generally in line with inflation. In neither case have we specified a time period, so whether or not W owns more than he owes is not a given. If it is on a longer time scale, so that W does own more than he owes, then Q has had plenty of time for interest to work in his favor on the money he has been saving. In other words, the situation is not cut and dry."
TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,PhysicalStuff,2,Sun Mar 23 19:52:26 2014 UTC,"Good point. I guess real estate should be considered an investment, though  usually a pretty sensible and low-risk investment in the long term. As with any investment, however, a certain risk is involved. It's not unheard of that people who made the sensible choice of putting their money in bricks have ended up ruined, often because of volatile market conditions like real estate pricing bubbles or insensible mortages.  The intent of my previous comment was to explain why it is generally a good investment, though I assumed a long-term stable market and perhaps somewhat idealized mortage options. These assumptions can well be questioned in the current economical situation.  EDIT: I admit that the situation I'm viewing this from is somewhat favourable when it comes to making long term investments, living in a country with free education, universal healthcare, extensive social security, high but stable taxes, a seemingly neatly recovering economy, and, for myself, a rather stable public sector employment. If you are in United States or a similar country your circumstances might be more volatile, which must of course be taken into consideration in your desicion making.

I make 42,000 a year salary, and I don't spend much money on ""wants"" (clothes, electronics, new camping gear, etc), mainly just ""needs"". You'd be surprised how quickly the ""needs"" add up.   Health and dental insurance provided by work, and I get around $100/month taken out of my paycheck. This doesn't include the ever increasing co pays and medicine costs. I also contribute 5% to my 401(K), and $250/month to a Roth IRA. Then there are utilities, rent, and car insurance. My car is paid off in full, but it still requires washes, oil changes, and maintenance. I'm in beautiful Colorado, so unfortunately the gas prices are outrageous. I travel a bit for work, so I fill up about once a week. Then there are the student loans. The lovely, lovely student loans. You can make good money straight out of college, it's possible, but chances are you're going to have student loans to thank for the degree that got you that job.  My biggest expenses involve my pets. I have two big Lab mixes and a cat. Food, veterinary bills, licenses, medicine, it adds up fast. These guys would never be considered a ""want"" instead of a ""need"", so there's no backing out of those expenses.  I have zero debt besides student loans. I pay my credit card off every month before it's due, and I don't buy many material items. I'm definitely able to save a good amount each month, but saving $40,000 in just a few years is unrealistic.

TooAfraidToAsk,215m78,RETROELECTRO,2,Mon Mar 24 02:43:32 2014 UTC,"I think the question is more about why the person is buying a house.   If they are doing it because they feel it is a safer place to raise a family than a very inexpensive apartment, the benefits of home ownership outweigh future financial considerations.   If they are doing it as speculation of home prices increasing, I would say they don't have enough faith in the stock market.  If they are doing it to have more room to party, financial considerations are probably not that high on the list.  Since you are 17, discussing in reference to your specific tax situation I wouldn't think is ver helpful, because the tax code can change. Even if you are very prudent, saving up $100k to put as a down payment on a house could take 10 years, since you are saving it in a very low risk environment in order to expect to access it in a fairly short amount of time. In 10 years, the house prices and lending market might have changed to the point that $100k down doesn't have as much purchasing power as $15k did 6 years previously. If you are able to save up $100k in just a few years, you are in a very different financial situation that the vast majority of people.   If you, personally, are making the assumption that you won't have kids by the time you have $100k saved for a house, you are going to have to find a partner that agrees with that philosophy, or wait on finding that partner. People that live on the basics in college do so because they have very little money to spend. If you continue to live very frugally after college, and all of your friends are making $50k a year, you are likely to find that your friends don't want to buy a case of cheap beer, they want to go to a nice restaurant and spend money on alcohol. They want to spend a few thousand dollars going to Vegas, or the beach. The women that were fine with fast food and a bottle of wine in college are going to expect a different lifestyle once they are out of college.   If you aren't planning to get married or have kids ever, why would you want to buy a house to live in if you were happy in a minimalistic apartment for so long?  Anyway, nothing wrong with trying to be prudent. Just keep in mind, you are 17, and even with your timeline you have at least 4 years before you can even start this plan of saving."

Once you have that degree and you get a job and have more money than you ever have had in your life it is very difficult to keep eating Ramen noodles and PB&J when you don't have to.  You reward yourself Starbucks coffee and eating out for lunch, you treat wants like they are needs, you give in to peer pressure (Joe has a new iPhone and Bob just took a vacation to Florida).

TooAfraidToAsk,20tmwu,Bakgrund,10,Wed Mar 19 16:35:13 2014 UTC,"Obviously, not all gay guys do this, but the phenomenon has actually been researched and there's a couple of contributing factors.   a) The gay scene before Stonewall (i.e. the beginning of gay liberation) was very much underground, as sodomy was a punishable offence in Britain and the US. Gay guys who didn't want to give in to societal norms, marry a woman, stuff like that, tended to cluster together in the larger cities, typically in conjunction with other marginalized crowds -- gypsies, traders, prostitutes, sailors, and especially theater people. It was quite a vibrant scene that played with gender norms a lot, and in some areas, developed its own lingo, Polari, partially to build group identity, partially because there was a necessity to speak in code sometimes, to protect the group from outsiders. After Stonewall, when the gay scene became less underground and less marginalized, there wasn't as much need for that kind of covert identity-building and a lot of the old-school culture disappeared, but there are still traces left, most notably drag culture. Still, language is a relatively easy (but obvious) way to differentiate your in-group from the masses -- which is the root of most slang -- so some gay men still use this register to differentiate themselves from straight dudes.  b) There's a way of speaking that has been titled Women's Language, or WL, that's characterized by tag questions, question intonation, and ""weak"" directives (more here). With more research, however, it turned out that it's actually a register used by all kinds of socioeconomically disadvantaged/marginalized groups, including immigrants and poor people of both genders, women, and gay men (who tend, or tended, to face more discrimination in the workplace).   c) There is some research into where homosexuality comes from -- I'm sure you've heard of the nurture vs. nature debate. Right now, it looks like it's most likely genetically and/or hormonally hard-coded, and there are some cross-genetic indicators. It's kind of like how red-haired people have a higher chance of having freckles and/or light eyes than dark-haired people, some traits tend to occur in combination. So, gay men are more likely to have cowlicks go the other direction (I think it's counter-clockwise as opposed to clockwise, but I'd have to check), have longer pointer than ring fingers, and a higher incidence of a smaller voicebox, i.e. a higher voice.   Likewise, lesbians are more likely to have a relatively larger voicebox (compared to the female average), but as they weren't anywhere near as actively persecuted as male homosexuals, there was never a need for a more active lesbian culture to develop. Consequently, gay male language is a much more obvious phenomenon.   If you're interested in an in-depth look at all of this, check your local university library for 'Language and Sexuality' by Don Kulick and Deborah Cameron, which is fantastic and very, very entertaining.  tl;dr nature, nurture, centuries of discrimination"

So, she was still, more or less, the same size as she was when she was, maybe, 6 months old.   She lay in a specially made bed that made it easy for her parents to change diapers, she had a tube to her stomach so she could get food.  In a way, it was sad, because she could never, and had never, experienced anything. Her life was so, so, different from mine and she had no idea how different we were.  She still had touch, obviously, so I would go round sometimes, and hold her hands, stroke her face, that kind of thing. She could hear things if they were REALLY loud, so every week, we used to go round, take tambourines, a keyboard, bells and anything else and play to her for a couple of hours. She would smile and it was, by far, the most heartwarming smile I've ever seen.   Unfortunately, she died aged 6. Her mum said that, given Charlie's circumstance, she'd had the best possible life condition and the best possible friends.

TooAfraidToAsk,20jp3r,RedLegionnaire,4,Tue May 13 09:12:43 2014 UTC,"This is something that i was discussing with some friends just a few days ago. I'm no expert, but I'll share our conclusion.  When you say that you're only attracted to females, you are expressing sexual orientation. Although it is still heavily debated, science leans towards the idea that sexual orientation is part of someone's nature. That means that unless a person learns to deviate from their normal orientation, s/he cannot help it if s/he is only attracted to a specific gender.  The main debate was over why exactly it would be considered racist to be attracted to a specific race.  Personally, I think that it's because race is the sort of thing that a person usually learns to be attracted to. So, in many situations, it would be considering one race superior while inferably considering others inferior (maybe not on a very extreme level, but it's kinda there). In other situations, it would be having merely a fetish for that race instead of actually appreciating that race (kind of like when a person only likes men or women because sex). Because this is not something that is engrained in nature and because a person can help it, this would indicate that the person is racist, even if on a minor level.  To clarify, ""situation"" refers to the observer's attitude, not his or her race or the race being observed."

This is a matter of definition.  Why is ""sexual orientation"" a part of our ""nature"" (what does that mean, again?) and a fetish for a race ""something we learn""?  After all, you've got societies like Ancient Greece where much more men were attracted to men, so it's very reasonable to consider the option that being attracted to a specific gender is ""something we learn"", too (even if not something we choose)."

TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,czwblitz,2,Fri Mar 7 03:43:28 2014 UTC,Absolutely. A self-diagnosis is going to be less accurate than the opinion of a stranger.
TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,GoldenSights,3,Fri Mar 7 03:57:23 2014 UTC,"I think the standard ""trolol doctor"" advice may not be very useful to you, because the way mental health systems work have yet to catch up with what we traditionally think of as ""medicine"". A doctor can very objectively tell you that your leg is broken, but when it comes to mental health it can very easily become a crapshoot and dependent on the very first couple of doctors you do end up seeing.   Is there some sort of way I could gauge what's wrong with me   Do you feel like life is shittier than it has to be? Mental health is all about quality of life. Do you feel like there is something about how you experience your consciousness that is painful, or extremely dissatisfying that you don't think other people suffer from?  Beware self-diagnosis; just because it seems personally relevant doesn't mean that you're necessarily likely to suffer from it - but it is important to have a broad understanding of what can go wrong. I'd recommend carefully reading all the wiki articles and random web health forums on all the mental conditions and only then thinking about what you're undergoing.  In the end, mental health is all about how your subjective experience of life.  So.  Depression/dysthymia: do you feel apathetic and listless and where your hope and optimism should be, there is just an empty void? Do you feel tired all the time, and do you find that it's incredibly hard to get out of bed in the morning? Do you incapable of pleasure in everyday activities?  autism: you would've known by now. To my my knowledge, definitely not something you gain post childhood. Do you have the capacity to empathize with other people? Are you overwhelmed with your own perception of other people's emotions? (How easily do you get along with people? Can you predict their moods/not let them affect you directly?)  bipolar: do you have manic phases? As in, are there period of times where everything is great! and you feel full of energy and really distractible and then at a moment's notice you become depressed/dysthymic?  Finally, paranoia, auditory hallucinations and apathy are also symptoms of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is unusual in children and to my understanding usually onsets during one's early 20s. Do you have lots of anxiety? Are you also depressed? Do you feel like you have a blunted affect? How do your auditory hallucinations affect your emotions?    Finally, it's important to distinguish possible causes. Many mental illnesses have genetic or early-environmental causes, but it's worth noting that a lot of them are exacerbated by stress. Are you under a lot of pressure right now? Huge amounts of stress could be pushing you over the edge and cause all of these symptoms, especially if you haven't been getting enough sleep. Sleep, regular exercise and diet, for most healthy people, are sufficient for maintaining quality of life.   Become informed with all of the above prior to talking to a doctor. Try not to guide the conversation into your own preferred/suspect diagnosis. Get a referral to a mental health specialist from your GP.  Hope that helps."
TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,hiffy,2,Fri Mar 7 04:30:37 2014 UTC,"I like everything you said in there, except for how you said OP should read up before going to a doctor. I'm no expert, but auditory hallucinations of a young child screaming sound like something that you shouldn't waste time on. (Also the way he described the scream as 'haunting' makes it sound like it is directly affecting his emotions already.) If I were OP I would go to a doctor right away and describe all of my symptoms without telling the doctor what I think I might have. Waiting to read up first might waste precious time."
TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,MiniCooperUSB,2,Fri Mar 7 05:30:21 2014 UTC,"I tried to address this above, but to go over my reasoning - it's super hard and time consuming to navigate mental health system, and it's often a crapshoot.  I mean. It's a crapshoot with any health issue. You really need to be informed about the possible range of issues you might have and be prepared to take charge in managing your own treatment - but it's especially bad with mental health issues.  It's exceedingly easy to see a doctor who is having a crappy day and walk out with a diagnosis that doesn't really address your concerns - and so you need to be informed about the range of issues and treatments at your disposal so you can meaningfully navigate your total range of options.  He should absolutely walk in and avoid biasing the doctor, but also have the capacity to think about whether it's worth second guessing said doctor. For instance, they may prescribe you medication whose side effects you are not comfortable with, and it's really worth being informed."
TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,hiffy,1 point,Fri Mar 7 17:00:32 2014 UTC,"Perhaps ""haunting"" was the wrong term to use.

TooAfraidToAsk,1zs2s3,Altostratus,1 point,Fri Mar 7 11:15:06 2014 UTC,"The wiki articles are actually pretty decent for a broad overview of how some of these conditions work or are looked at. Beware self-diagnosis; a lot of different conditions are co-morbid and so it's exceedingly easy to identify with a particular issue when in fact there are often fairly well devised diagnostic criteria that professionals use to evaluate them.  Look thru the wiki bibliographies, and treatment options - and also look through http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed for relevant papers. You'll often find literature reviews that talk about the latest up to date treatment protocols for different conditions (note: it's a little non trivial to figure out the precise medical language used)  If you go in and get diagnosed with something, it can be really helpful to have an understanding of treatment options; if a doctor pushes you towards meds when you might prefer to investigate say CBT first that's definitely worth knowing beforehand."

TooAfraidToAsk,1zr9lk,Raven_Rise,2,Thu Mar 6 22:49:50 2014 UTC,"In the US, that is almost correct, but not quite.  When you fill out your FAFSA, you enter in your tax information, i.e. income from the previous year. This amount determines whether or not you qualify for financial aid.

TooAfraidToAsk,1zr9lk,elfa82,1 point,Thu Mar 6 23:54:23 2014 UTC,"FAFSA, in the US, typically goes off your supporting income. If your father declares you as a dependent, then that's the information that will go onto your tax return. Also, if you're under a specific age, you'll need to declare emancipation if your parents are not supporting you (ie: your parents are separated, but not divorced and your non-custodial parent makes a lot of money).  Having said that, I would talk to a college financial aide adviser, they will know all of the rules/regulations relating to this and your specific situation."

TooAfraidToAsk,1zlguo,billy0246810,15,Wed Mar 5 03:50:40 2014 UTC,"The version I'll tell is controversial, but the most accurate.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has envisioned a return of Russia to superpower status. In order for the now re-energized nation to do this, it must win influence within, and expand, its existing sphere of influence. Putin, a former KGB officer, has even been on record despairing over the loss of the Soviet Union.  But the growth of Russia's sphere of influence is limited, at the time being. Russia has virtual control over the central Asian nations, but is territorially checked to the south by India, to the Southeast by China, and to the west by both NATO and the EU.  If you remember the 2008 South Ossetia War between Russia and Georgia, you may remember the cause of the conflict: Russia's desire to ""protect"" South Ossetians and Abkhazians who may be Russian citizens, although that statistic is very low. The war with Georgia came at a time when Georgia was attempting to enter NATO.  NATO, being an international alliance established with the very intention of countering the combined forces of the Warsaw Pact nations, now finds itself opposing Russia. However, the threat from Russia upon Georgia is now too great, and by engaging Georgia, Russia has also removed Georgia's ability to join NATO. NATO does not want to risk such a certainty for all-out war with Russia should they attack a Georgia that's in the organization, and Russia does not want anymore NATO members sitting on her bordersand preventing the growth of the Russian Federation in land and both political and economic influence.  Fast forward six years to today - 2014. Ukraine, finding itself in economic straits and having elected a pro-Russian government, has fielded offers for economic aid in the form of loans from both Russia and the EU. Now, whoever Ukraine borrows from also inherently buys into that entity's influence, as well. The government of Ukraine wanted to accept the Russian offer (and had already partially done so), but many of the people there were pro-EU.  This is where the protests began. Peaceably, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, mainly in the pro-West western and central areas of Ukraine, attempted to protest, but were (arguably) both fired upon and denied their right to protest. Allegations of both murder and torture of protesters sprang up, and the protests became violent.  Now, it is (controversially) worth mentioning that as this stage was unfolding, a Russian intelligence ship docked in Havana. At the same time, Russians, under the premise of defending Russian-speakers in Crimea, have secured the Crimean peninsula, in violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Essentially, Russia has taken advantage of the large Russian-speaking population of Crimea, as well as the presence of the Russian naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea, to actively engage the Ukrainian government.  Currently, the Russians have not ruled out a full-blown invasion and dismantling of Ukraine. The Duma (Russian parliament) has at least considered legislation which would more easily allow for the annexation of at least parts of Ukraine.  So, to recap, as it stands, Russia is eyeing its pro-West neighbors, most of them former Warsaw Pact nations, and wanting to bring them down a peg without risking all-out war with NATO. With Belarus virtually on board with a revival of a Russian superpower, this left the rebellious Ukraine as the only frontier country left that was neither pro-Russia or a NATO member.  Sorry for the novel, but a TL;DR is impossible for this one. I have a strong feeling this won't be read, but I enjoyed typing it, at least.  EDIT: Clarity."

Not realizing the effects it can have on judgement, as a non-driver I had to help my dad kickstart his car so he told me gently press on the pedal, and I did ever so slightly and the car reved like a mutha ucker , now I can only imagine how being the slightest bit drunk will effect someone trying to drive within speed limits, they must be going anywhere between 20 and 40 trying to stay at 30."
TooAfraidToAsk,1uq3it,ravia,0,Thu Jan 9 10:21:19 2014 UTC,"There are lots of angles to take on this, but I think one of the best is that it has to do with how they manage fear on on everyday basis. DD's do not feel palpable, real fear about drunk driving. They have various defense mechanisms for manging it, to the point of it being like ""muscles"" that help suppress that fear. Even viewing videos of accidents my be counterproductive, because this is just a kind of ""flexing"" exercise for them.   This points to the idea that in a clinical setting, rewards for having a real (and perhaps measurable) fear response may be a way to ameliorate the problem. That, coupled with training in how to be afraid. As well as inculcating a healthy philosophy of fearfulness (at the right times)."
TooAfraidToAsk,1uipxc,2Afraid2AskAboutCuts,23,Mon Jan 6 05:50:08 2014 UTC,"I cut for 12 years. It's not a weak suicide attempt. For me it was a way to distract myself from everything that was going on around me and inside my head. It calmed the chaos and let me channel it all to something I was able to control. It also helped me to snap out of disassociative states I would go in to. Watching myself heal was a reminder that I was alive. Pain was a reminder that I was alive. Blood was a reminder that I was alive. When you have control over nothing, even your own mind, you grasp on to the one thing you can find. As u/accio_chocobo said, a lot of the time when I cut was during anger, not sadness. It was easier to take out anger on myself than risk the consequences of outwardly showing anger in bad situations. It is incredibly addictive too because pain releases endorphin's in your brain which make you happy. If you are more interested in it, there's a really great book called A Bright Red Scream, you can pick it up Here  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask away."

They do that to distract you from the pain. Cutting is similar. When the emotional pain is unbearable, the physical pain is a more acceptable diversion.   There is an aspect of seeing the blood and feeling the pain of it that reminds you you're alive. It's almost cathartic. Then the endorphins kick in and you start to feel a little bit better, or at least a bit numbed to the overwhelming emotional pain that pushed you to that point.  For most people, it's not a cry for attention in any way. Most people cut in private, and most never tell anyone nor do they reveal their scars. And many cutters secretly have shame issues. They somehow feel as if they deserve to be punished."

When I get one (wherein somebody is basically cutting me, just with super-fast needles instead of a blade), at least for the time while I'm getting it, it pushes the depression aside. I can't think about the shit in my life that sucks, because all I can think about is the woman who's stabbing me in the arm a thousand times a minute. All I can focus on is the immediate moment, the physical pain. And it is wonderful. Just a half hour of not thinking about my shit. I try to get that from other places (movies, music, tv, gaming), but nothing does it quite the same, quite as well.  So, I've never cut myself, and I don't plan to start.

But, at the risk of sounding too graphic or overdramatic, something about the bleeding calmed me. I would just watch it and immediately feel calm.

Turns out, they only notice the cutting, not the suffering.  When you're depressed sometimes it feels good to wallow in it. It's comfortable and familiar. The depth of the pain became beautiful, so it felt good to indulge.  Other people I've talked to who were also cutters had very different reasons. Some did it because it was the only thing they could control. Some did it for the emotional release. For some people, it was the only time they could feel anything at all.  With time came emotional maturity. For most of us, after a certain point, the emotional pain associated with cutting outweighed the benefits of doing it."
TooAfraidToAsk,1uipxc,Karanime,1 point,Mon Feb 3 12:07:11 2014 UTC,"I cut for a while, still think about it sometimes. But, I did it because it gave me something to control. If I felt that I was in an emotional situation that was getting to the best of me, I'd cut. Either on my arm, or my shoulder. Usually, the worse the reason, the more I hid it. It's almost drug like because for me, the adrenaline from cutting made my more negative emotions go away. The only reason I stopped was because I watched as my wife (girlfriend at the time) was being hurt by what I was doing because she didn't understand that it wasn't me trying to commit suicide. She would cry because of it, so I quit because her being happy was more important to me. But, then I started smoking weed and that helped too."
TooAfraidToAsk,1uipxc,littlbat,1 point,Tue Jan 7 07:06:58 2014 UTC,"I used to cut. It used to be a mixture of reasons, the primary one being that I felt so dead and empty that it reassured me that I was alive and could feel something, even if it was pain. Part of it was that I thought the reason I was so miserable is because I was a horrible, useless person and it was a form of self punishment. And then....it kind of felt like screaming without anyone noticing. Like a more socially acceptable way of acting out. Was kind of hoping people saw and dragged me to somewhere where I could get help, but so, so ashamed of myself for it too.  When I tried to stop, I found it stupidly hard because it had become an addictive coping method...not just a case of just stopping. It took me several months to finally be ""all clear"", and a couple of years before I trusted myself around sharp things. Now I barely think about it."

For me, it was because I wanted to lash out, but I didn't want to hurt anyone else. I didn't even want to break stuff, because we were in a very bad place financially.  I also had been trying to convince those around me of the level of depression and anxiety I was dealing with, but felt like nobody was taking me seriously. I thought that if I cut myself, it was a chance for people who I felt weren't caring about me, to see the wounds (or eventually, scars), and get suspicious, notice I was hurting myself, and realize this was more serious than they'd been giving credit for.   Unfortunately (?) I did not succeed or persist at cutting, and instead went directly to my husband and told him what I had tried to do. It didn't quite go as planned..."

TooAfraidToAsk,1txny0,kapkaja,10,Sun Dec 29 09:43:06 2013 UTC,"If you're talking about how they know about you, they don't. They'll ask a random sample and work it out from there.  4 out of 5 women simply means they asked a bunch of randomly selected women (say 500) and work out the percentage of them.  4/5 of a random sample is probably similar to 4/5 of the wider population.  The more people they ask the more accurate it is, but they could theoretically have just asked 5 women."
TooAfraidToAsk,1txny0,TheTretheway,3,Sun Dec 29 09:55:59 2013 UTC,"Yes, that's what I thought. But 500 is too little a number. It just seems purely coincidental to me. Is there anything else they do?"
TooAfraidToAsk,1txny0,Handyland,13,Sun Dec 29 10:01:43 2013 UTC,"500 is plenty, and for most types of questions, you could actually get away with much much less.  What's more important is that the study is properly conducted, which is very difficult.  Here's why, using your orgasm example:  When speaking generally about every woman, the group you are sampling from must include every woman.  In the world.  This means having a list of every single woman in the world, numbering them, using a random number generator, then going and asking the women that you chose the question and recording their answers.  This also means very carefully asking the questions so that the subjects understand what you are asking, as well as asking them in a way that will not bias your subjects.    So, our first problem with all this is the 'all the women in the world' part.  It's virtually impossible to sample all the women in the world.  What about those living in minuscule communities in the middle of a forest in a war-torn country?  You just can't realistically capture the group you want to.  So you have to limit the group you sample from, and therefore have to limit the claims of your study.  So in the orgasm study, they likely asked women only in the US (for example).  But that isn't the only restriction.  They certainly didn't take a list of every woman in the whole country, and chose from there.  Maybe they went out into the streets to ask people, and chose every 10th woman that walked by.  Now this introduces more problems.  First, where are we asking these questions?  Downtown L.A.?  Now your results only represent urban women.  Ok, let's make a random list of every city in the country, large and small, and select a sample of those to ask in.  We'll take 50 cities, and ask 10 people in each.  Or maybe stratify it more, and take 10 random cities from 5 random US states!  That's all a bit better, but here's another bias: your study selects people who are more likely to go out.  Maybe women who stay in more often orgasm less.  Or more!  And if you're out on the streets at 3pm on a Tuesday, it excludes working women.  Weekends?  Poorer women who work every day!  But maybe these things aren't too problematic if we can claim that rich and poor women, urban and rural women, are just as likely to have had an orgasm as one another (note! this is different than ""will ever have an orgasm!)  Being out on the street also introduces the problem of bias in asking.  Let's say we stop Jane Doe, age 20 and single, and out with her ultra-conservative mother.  Jane has been fucking her boyfriend for a year now, but they aren't married, so Jane says she's never had an orgasm to a nod of approval from her mother.  Okay, fuck it, nix the street.  Let's call people.  Everyone has a phone, right?  Plus the privacy of being at home coupled with the state of anonymity may get rid of some of the holes in our study.  Plus, it's easier to get home phone numbers than some magical list of all women and a way to contact them.  Again, we have a problem of separating out the poor without phones.  Another problem with calling home phones is young people barely have them!  And that's sure to change the results of almost any question you want to ask.  Lucky for us, the orgasm question is relatively simple.   Have you ever had an orgasm? Yes.   Oops, what about sexually inexperienced women who think they had an orgasm, but will later come to laugh at the embarrassing time they had that didn't actually result in one?  One of the many problems of self-reporting, in addition to lying.  But there are much more complex questions out there.   Do you believe in God? Yes. He says, thinking of the Abrahamic God Yes... She says, thinking of a Hindu god Yes. She says, thinking of nature Yes. He says, thinking of the carving he made from the flesh of his neighbor that sits on a plinth in his room   I guess we have to refine that question...   Do you believe in the God of the Abrahamic religions? No! She says, cursing the blasphemers of Islam and Christianity, for they do not share her glorious god   And these questions are just a categorical ""yes"" or ""no"".  Once you introduce quantitative variables, you get even more potential problems!  Now we have confidence intervals, power, means modes and medians, r-values, t-tests, standard deviations, least-squares-regression-lines...  Oh boy.  TL;DR: Studies are hard."

All food you ingest takes several hours (usually 10-36 or so depending on what it is and how much) to digest and pass through the system. When you have to go to the bathroom a few minutes after eating, it is not the food you just ate that you are eliminating, it is the food from the previous day that was already towards the end. Your digestive system is like a queue, first in first out.  The reason this sometimes happens probably varies, but it can have to do with the amount of food you ate which is why a lot of people experience this after eating at buffet or after a holiday meal. Your body speeds up peristalsis - the rhythmic muscle contractions that push food along the tube - to make sure there is room. It can also happen if you ingest food that your body wants to get rid of quickly for some reason, or if it's hard for your body to digest, like high fatty foods if you have gallbladder trouble, for example."

TooAfraidToAsk,1tjjof,penguinluvinman,3,Tue Dec 24 07:03:50 2013 UTC,"Nope. In fact the symptoms come from the fact that the milk has to sit in your small intestine. Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency in production of the enzyme lactase that breaks down the sugar lactose. Lactose is a disaccharide (2 smaller sugars (glucose and galactose) attached together) that has to be broken down into it's two components. Lactose cannot be absorbed intestine as a whole molecule, so when you don't have enough lactase to break it down, it passes through intact. Bacteria that live in your intestines can then feed on it and ferment it to produce byproducts of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane that causes the various abdominal symptoms (bloating and gas). The unabsorbed sugars and fermentation products also raise the osmotic pressure of the colon, causing an increased flow of water into the bowels (diarrhea).  Additional fun fact: Adult onset lactose intolerance is actually the norm in pretty much all other mammals. Pretty much all other animals lose or have a great reduction in their ability to produce lactase after weaning. Yes, that means you should not give your cat milk once they pass the ""kitten"" stage. And a majority of the humans in the world (as many as 75%) are lactase non-persistent and suffer from some degree of lactose intolerance as an adult. Some groups of humans are unique in that we have ""lactase persistence"" and can still drink milk as adults. This gave the evolutionary advantage of helping to prevent things like osteoporosis. There's a fairly complex, but interesting, genetic mechanism behind it but I've already probably said more than you cared to know about it all.... </nerdrant>  Edit: Unless I totally misinterpreted your question....it does go through you like all the rest of your food. But it doesn't ""go right through you"" as asked in the OP - i.e. it doesn't shoot through your digestive system in a matter of minutes or bypass the rest of the food that has been waiting in line."

Say you eat something that moves through your digestive tract fairly quickly, perhaps a liquid food supplement or cleanse or even laxative. Would this liquid/sludge pick up things already in the tract, or would it pass around some things?   I read this article about a journalist who had an enema at a specialty enema-focused resort, and they sifted the stuff that came out, and a marble he had swallowed at age 5 came out. I always wondered if that were true, and how it would have stayed caught for so long."

But it's different for every girl, it's not like a universal model that works the same no matter who it is.  Also, I have met my fair share of girls who didn't know where the clitoris was, thanks to our amazing sexual education practices here in the states. :P  Speaking for me, personally, vaginal sex is the best, and it cannot be replicated without a penis. Knowing that the dude you're fucking is getting as much pleasure as you are is the best part of sex. Feeling a body against you, and the way the penis sometimes pulsates during orgasm...those are things that you can't fake.  Tl;dr: yes, he can."

Thus, there tends to be a great deal of ""overcorrection"" in which the fight for equality instead becomes a witch hunt hell bent on some sort of reparations/revenge for years of inequality & mistreatment. This sort of thing can be applied to any historically mistreated ""group"" of people, whether it be based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, whatever. Many would argue that it is precisely these sort of ppl give feminism & the fight for equality a bad name. So long story short, there's ""equality"" and then there is ""revenge"" (the better word is slipping my mind right now), and it is an entirely other & equally (if not more) intense situation when deciding if/when/how to account for/ make up for historical indiscretions acted out upon an entire group."

TooAfraidToAsk,1qkqtw,bagelll,16,Thu Nov 14 19:21:48 2013 UTC,"I think it's an attitude that is due to a lot of misconceptions about feminism and an overcorrection. Feminism is equality for all. Meaning that people should be treated the same and given the same opportunities regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual preference, race, etc. Feminism in no way means that women are better than men. But because there has been so much oppression of women, some attitudes have come about that to correct this oppression, we must act like women are better than men. This is not feminism, it's something else entirely. It's important to acknowledge that men and women are different due to biology. There are some things men can do and do better that women can't do or can't do well, and vice versa. But this does not mean that people shouldn't be given the opportunity to do those things. I think because of this, there is some innate competition between the sexes that is wholly unnecessary. Don't confuse feminism with women>men. People that believe that are just as sexist as those that believe men>women."
TooAfraidToAsk,1qkqtw,CYKL0N3,3,Thu Nov 14 00:48:19 2013 UTC,Feminism =/= Gender egalitarianism  Feminism has a built in bias towards women.

It's simple. These girls don't want gender equality. They just say that to make you think they do.  There are plenty of good feminists who actually want real equality, the good parts of equality and the bad parts.  There are also plenty of shitty feminists who want to have all of the benefits equality would bring, but also want to remain immune to the disadvantages equality would bring. They'll cry and scream that ""97% of CEO's of companies are men because patriarchy! Affirmative action!"", but when it comes to the fact that 97% of construction workers, garbage collectors and the like are men, they're mysteriously silent about affirmative action.  That's the kind of bad example of a feminist you're describing. It's not a big stretch from there to see how that kind of person would say ""oh yeah, equality all the way!"" when really they're not interested in anything but the benefits, and that they're using the word ""equality"" to try to make people think they're doing something righteous and good.  Some feminists actually care about equality. But not the ones who act as you describe. The only thing they care about is taking advantage of everyone for their own benefit while avoiding the negatives actual equality would bring them.

However for a more academic thorough read on the subject I recommend Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex.  To answer your question though, I think the notion that women are greater than men comes from a misconception about gender equality. Women and men are different in biological ways that means they can never really be treated equal, but that also doesn't mean that women should see themselves as greater than men. Just different. (Intellectually I think that women and men are equal though.) It's just the biological part that can lead to notion's of competition between genders because of the unequal footing there."
TooAfraidToAsk,1qkqtw,Black-Knyght,6,Thu Nov 14 00:23:40 2013 UTC,"I've read de Beauvoir's book, and I disagree that people should read it. I came across the title reading a pulp detective novel, and then picked up to see what the huff was about.  Worst mistake I've made in a long time.  While de Beauvoir presented some interesting notions about ""sex"" and ""gender"", and ""woman as a social construct"", it's readily apparent that she doesn't like other women, and seems to hate being one herself.  Her whole perception of her own gender colors the whole work and comes across in a really pissy voice. It appears that she blows up problems she has into problems for all women. So it seems she's pushing her personal agenda to the forefront of the second wave feminism. She all but accuses the reader of being the problem, and berates them for it for two volumes. She idealizes female sex in such a way as to shame women who enjoy sex with men.  I get it. It was the 40's, and she was pissed off being a woman in that era. And to be honest, I understand why she was angry. More than that, I support her right to be angry. But holding up The Second Sex as a ""more accurate thorough read on the subject"" in this particular thread will only help push OP towards the idea that feminism is not about equality, and more about something else.  And you're right. If you think women should be able to vote and own property, you are a feminist, a First Wave Feminist, but a feminist none the less."

I don't think she sounded angry when I read it at all. She was merely stating what was inferred from her existential position.   Beauvoir was in no way sexist against males, she had plenty of male companions, Sarte and Camus included. It was also a main point of hers that the women of her time had been taught to subjugate themselves, but offered up points on how this could be overcome which does not sound like someone who hates women either."

It's awesome that she didn't come at it as ""anything men can do, women can do too!""   I don't think she sounded angry when I read it at all. She was merely stating what was inferred from her existential position.   We'll just have to disagree on that one. I totally understand how her position would lead her to be angry, and it's not like it's completely in your face angry, it's just this undertone to her writing that leads me to feel this way.   Beauvoir was in no way sexist against males, she had plenty of male companions, Sarte and Camus included.   I never said that she was sexist against men. I totes know about her various male friends and colleagues.   It was also a main point of hers that the women of her time had been taught to subjugate themselves, but offered up points on how this could be overcome which does not sound like someone who hates women either.

Yes people are into it if it exists I assure you. My personal evidence for this is that most of my partners over the past few years have been into rape play. I always thought that was the one thing that very few people were into but from what I've seen in my relationships and from what people say online its more common than you'd think. Now I assume pretty much all fetishes are more common than you would guess. The thing is, most people pretend to be grossed out by a lot of fetishes because they are taboo and its a very personal thing. If you get close enough to someone in a relationship you're going to probably be surprised by what the person tells you they are in to."

As an example, people in positions of power, like say a judge or CEO, are more likely to be into dominatrix where they play the submissive role.  The point there being that fetishes seem to be an escape from reality for some.  The tidy will be messy, the timid will be violent, the shnosberrys taste like shnosberrys...   wait.

I think what you're asking is if it hurts the same way as it does to a man, and I'm going to say no. I've heard men say the pain is actually more in the abdomen than the groin, and takes your breath away, which isn't how it feels for a girl. It's a more sharp, localized, pain that (usually) quickly fades into a dull throbbing/soreness/bruised feeling as opposed to the debilitating, long-lasting, radiating pain that men experience. I'm not a man so I can't really speak to what it's actually like, I'm just going by what I've heard."

He asked if I ever jerked off while to the motion while they were doing it. No, I didn't.  There was never a chance to do it in the bathroom, and it seemed really gross with how shared it all was.

I try to hang out with someone 2-3 times a week. Usually more in summer.   A week in my life? Well my life has been pretty busy this year. I've come out of my shell a bit. Last friday after school, my friend had a birthday party with all our friends from Drama. That was fun. Saturday and sunday I did nothing. Monday we had a snow day so the same general group of people got together and went sledding and had hot chocolate and hung out. Monday through wednesday I did nothing. Stayed inside, did some work around the house, slept, played GTA 5, played guitar, etc. (I love my solitary time, don't get me wrong.) I tried getting that girl whose birthday party it was to come over to hang out but each day she was busy again. So today was thursday and I stayed after school for the first day of rehearsals for our school's show. Since the theater kids stick together, I already had a ton of people I knew with me. Even when my skit was finished, I stayed around just to talk and hang out with everyone else. And tomorrow, I am going with my friend to her semi-formal at her school and sleeping over her house.   I would have loved to be like my current self back in freshman year. And you sound like you want to also. Listen dude, afterschool programs. They're a great way to make new friends. If you can, try to pick something that meets up very often or even daily.   But whether or not I have a ""normal person's life"" is a matter of perspective. For me, ""normal"" is the people in my school who go to parties and go out places every free night with friends and get drunk and stuff. I suppose I could go for that life if I really worked at it, but it's not something I want to do. I like being alone and spending a whole day sleeping and eating. So who cares if it's normal or not? If you are content not hanging out with people, there's nothing weird or not ""normal"" about it. If you aren't content with it, you at least have the ability to change it!

Honestly, I don't know exactly what her friends thought of me or our age difference, but we always got along well, she always said they liked me, and it never really felt that weird.  My friends never thought it was strange, and never treated her any differently.  She was relatively mature for her age, intellectually and emotionally, and I, like most 17 year old boys, was slightly immature in the same areas.

But I wanted to provide an example where it worked out pretty well for everyone.  Bonus: We ran into each other completely randomly a few weeks ago after not having seen each other for several years, and I don't think either of us has had any lasting psychological damage as a result.  Have her friends, or your friends, said anything specifically that makes it sounds like they think it would be creepy?  More importantly, has she shown reciprocal interest, or is this situation still riding the HopeTrain?"
TooAfraidToAsk,1nvgxv,beckettsfool,3,Mon Oct 7 00:15:21 2013 UTC,"The 2 biggest things I worry about is her parents, and our mutual friends, of which there are many. I suppose if her parents aren't super conservative weird religious people they're not an issue. But kids my age are very judgmental and I don't want to lose a single friend just to be in a relationship with this one girl. I mean I guess they'd all come around eventually if I stayed in a relationship long enough to show I actually care about her.  Life's hard man."
TooAfraidToAsk,1nvgxv,beckettsfool,3,Mon Oct 7 00:31:19 2013 UTC,"If you're a person who shows integrity in your decisions, I can't see how anyone would have a problem.  If there are specific people who you think would have a problem with it, it is probably worthwhile to sit down and talk directly with them about your feelings on the matter.  When they see that your affection is real, not creepy, and not bundled with an intent to take advantage of this girl, they should come around.  If they don't, that's unfortunate, but it's their decision, and shouldn't stop you from trusting your feelings and going for something that you think will make you (and her) happy.  If enough of your friends understand, they will become your spokesmen when other friends try to trash your choices.  You're never going to please everybody.  Figure out what you want and then go for it.  As far as parents, you might even have an advantage.  You've had two more years to mature than her immediate peers, and if you can prove to them that you are someone deserving of their daughter's time and attention, there's no problem.  Life's hard, but it's not going to get any easier.  Figure out what makes you happy, and pursue it."

I was having to contend with convincing my friends that 22 is not a good age to date when you're 15 or 16 because of the serious creeper status of it.  But I don't think it's necessarily that weird.  I'd suggest holding off on any and all sex though until she's of legal age, even if you both really want to.  Just because there would be legal concerns there.  But as for dating and holding hands at the malt shop I don't think there's much issue.  Keep in mind that if you are interested in something that may go long term, you graduating and going to college is probably going to interfere with that more so than if you were the same age.  But I don't think it's too creepy, and if he were a nice guy I can't say I would have disapproved."
TooAfraidToAsk,1nvgxv,Blue-Nova,1 point,Sat Oct 12 02:28:24 2013 UTC,"I met one of my girlfriends when she was 15 and I was 18, there was about 3.5 years difference between us. I ignored how I felt for a bit but after talking to her so much we did actually start dating, because of her age though we took things amazingly slow.  The age difference isn't that much, and it becomes much less noticable as you get older, there's just few things you have to keep in mind though. Girls tend to mature faster then guys, but at 15 shes still not caught up to you in some regards, make sure you're not trying to push a relationship to far to fast, it's gonna be slower then relationships your friends have. You're also going to get teased by your friends, deal with it. I don't know how many times I heard the comment that I gotta go babysit my girlfriend. It's mostly just friends being friends but it does get old after a while.  It's gonna be different but if you think she's worth it go for it. My girlfriend and I were together for several years and eventually moved in together, it was definitly one of the more important relationships I've had as I learned a lot. If given the option I would do it again even though I know it didn't work out for us."
TooAfraidToAsk,1nvgxv,antidood1,1 point,Tue Oct 15 11:24:29 2013 UTC,"OP, I can't give you concrete advice on your own situation, since there's too many factors involved, I can only tell you about my own experience.  A bit of background first: I'm 18, my girlfriend of almost 4 months just turned 15 this week. This means she's more than 3 years younger than me, and she was 14 when we got into the relationship. We're taking things really slow, not only because of the age difference, or simply because she's young, but also because we've both never been in a relationship before this one.  I'm not 100% sure what the general consensus of the public about our relationship is. I'm sure there are people who think it's creepy, or just plain wrong. I do know that her parents are perfectly happy with it, and so are mine. And as far as I can tell, my friends are happy for me as well.  About the relationship itself, it's just great. I feel like I can talk to her really well. She is one of the people that best understand me for sure. The age difference is not a problem at all for me, nor is it a problem for her.  Now, to answer your question more specifically   So when/if you were around 16 +/- 2 years what would you have thought if your best female friend dated someone two years older than her?   I'd be happy for her, as I have realized that age is just a number (I'm disgusted by myself for using such a cliché, but it's definitely true for me).   And of course it's important what other people think, but I like to think like this: the people who make a problem out of it, are not people I want to have in my life. I understand people think it's weird, because it is pretty damn weird, but if they can't accept the fact that I'm happy with her, they aren't the kind of people whose opinions matter to me. And as far as my experience goes, the people who care about you will make the effort to look a little deeper than just ""ewww, he's dating a 14 year old, that's so gross"", to see that it's actually making me happy (and her as well). To be fair, I am very grateful for open-minded friends like that, because I realize it could all have been very, very different.  As you can see, in my situation, all factors have been pretty much perfect for a relationship (awesomely relaxed parents, cool open-minded friends, her being very mature for her age, etc.).  As for your situation OP, I think you should look at how these kind of factors are in your situation. That's only for you to judge. But, maybe even more importantly (horrible cliché #2 upcoming), do what feels right. Because only then you can justify your actions towards others. Things like ""I like to be with her"", ""she makes me happy"" etc. are the best, if not only right arguments to use against people who say you shouldn't be dating someone that young/old. And if they can't understand that, they might not be the kind of people you want to be with. (I understand it's not THAT simple, I'm just trying to provide some counterweight to the fear of losing friends/mutual friends)  Welp, so much for my rambling about this subject, feel free to ask... anything, I guess. And OP, I wish you the best of luck."

TooAfraidToAsk,1nqcwb,sephstorm,3,Fri Oct 4 16:33:14 2013 UTC,"The best way to describe the Order of the Eastern Star is as a female-led auxiliary of the Masons.  It admits both genders ages 18 and up; membership requires the men to be Master Masons while women must have a relationship to a mason (relative, wife) or having joined Job's Daughters or Rainbow Girls when they were younger.  Leadership roles in OES are occupied by women, with men serving solely in support positions.  For any Masonic lodge, you'll find a number of these other Masonic bodies affiliated with them, forming a ""Masonic Family.""  For women, there is either an OES or an ""Order of the Ameranth"" chapter.  For boys, you've got the Order of DeMolay, and for girls, there's Job's Daughters or the International Order of The Rainbow for Girls (Rainbow Girls).  I can't tell you the differences between the OES/Ameranth or Job's Daughters/Rainbow Girls, other than it might be regional.  Where I grew up (Wyoming), we had Job's Daughters, but in Montana they had Rainbow Girls.  In states with more population (i.e. every other state) they may have both."

TooAfraidToAsk,1nfr6d,sephstorm,18,Mon Sep 30 13:21:59 2013 UTC,"The issue ultimately comes down to: voter fraud is basically non existent, and any step you put in front of voters will reduce the eligible voting population.   But you don't let that stop you, you save up the money, up to $100 i've heard.   I think people in the middle class have a hard time imagining how these things are big barriers to actually poor people.   $100 is not a negligible sum when you live hand to mouth.    track down the documentation required   A lot of people don't have the required documentation; most people are simply not very good at this stuff. I don't have my birth certificate lying around; that's another cost and more time spent waiting.  Sometimes, not having a certain document leaves you in a catch-22, where you need proof A to get proof B and proof B to get proof A.   Some people say they live far away from a DMV   If you don't drive because you can't afford a car, that's a nonstarter (plus, see above re: lacking necessary documents). Not all offices open on weekends, which is especially taxing if you work two jobs.   The poors are lacking in both time and money, don't forget.  Finally,    then get in a van with others who need to go, and have a monthly drive into town to get people their ID.   Keep in mind that voter registration organizations are routinely harassed and targeted by Republican activists as being conduits for voter fraud, and most important that costs money and effort.   At the end of the day, you have to ask - WHY are you putting impediments to voting, and WHY are they designed in such a way to inconvenience the most disenfranchised?   It's trivial to conjure up people for whom getting their ducks in a row will cost hundreds of dollars and ten or twenty hours of time, and to see how most people who are not very politically aware will just give up.   Worth mentioning one last time that voter fraud is not problem that the United States encounters."

That's partly why the formulas break down, a 600 pound person with 400 pounds of fat does not need very many more calories than a 220 pound person with 20 pounds of fat. Yet the calculators will tell you you need a lot more (go try it). There is very little difference in caloric expense between a 400 pound person walking 5 min and a 180 pound person walking 5 min. (when the difference is fat). Unless you are training like an athlete your BMR is by far and away your biggest calorie expense,the work from a decent session in the gym might burn something like 230 calories which isn't that much when you compare it to ones BMR."

TooAfraidToAsk,1lsn7s,naygor,9,Sun Sep 15 17:34:40 2013 UTC,"The people who believe that it's all about calories in vs calories out aren't telling you exactly the whole truth. I don't blame them for having this view though, because if they're going to speak from experience, with all their body processes healthy and functioning normally, things will generally behave this way.  But, the human body isn't a jet engine. The way the human body processes the different macro nutrients (fats, proteins, carbohydrates), is evidence of this. Speaking of carbohydrates, there's evidence that, if your diet consists exclusively fructose (candies, sodas), you can expect higher triglycerides and worse insulin and leptin resistance, than if you ate glucose (starches).  Or, if you exclusively (say, under 50g of carbohydrates a day) eat fatty food, ketosis, a metabolic pathway  that a lot of people, save diabetics, probably never have heard of, starts to occur, which arguably may do some people good.   The body has numerous mechanisms in place to regulate appetite and body weight. Prior to the conception of a 'calorie', figuring out BMRs, and daily nutrition needs, people generally ate when they were hungry and didn't eat when they weren't. They would unconsciously over shoot their caloric needs by maybe 100, 500, 1000 calories on some days, and unconsciously under shoot on others, and in the end, their long term body weights wouldn't change all that much. What makes this possible is what health and nutrition researchers believe to be a hormone called leptin. I've heard this hormone described as a body energy availability 'thermostat', making the body more prone to energy expenditure and curbing appetite when energy is abundant, or more prone to energy conservation when deficient.    Long story short, you don't get to be morbidly obese and stay morbidly obese without significantly disrupting appetite regulating functions like these. Your sensitivity to leptin and insulin can make all the difference between whether those excess 50 calories you eat each day gets expended for energy or becomes that 5lb of fat hanging around your mid-section at the end of the year.   A lot of things don't help either. The neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine , are involved so you'll also see them more susceptible to irritability, lack of motivation, depression or any of the other myriad of mental health issues people might have. Chronic stress in any of it's forms, psychological or physical, directly contributes to inflammation, insulin and leptin resistance, and depression. And to further add to injury, being so overweight presents it's own kind of stress on the body. Not to mention, those involved in selling you your doritos, pepsis, cheez-its, and mountain dews, employ engineers, physicists, scientists, and chemists to basically exploit your biology to make you eat and buy as much of their product as possible."
TooAfraidToAsk,1lsn7s,flume,7,Fri Sep 6 03:02:30 2013 UTC,"losing and gaining weight is 100 percent thermodynamics. if you consume more calories than you burn you will gain weight. if you consume less calories than you burn you will lose weight. if you burn the same amount of calories as you consume you will stay the same weight. period. no exceptions.   the larger a body is the more calories it consumes. so as you get fatter you burn more calories. if you eat more calories than you burn you will gain weight. eventually you reach a certain weight where you do burn enough calories to match what you're eating, and you will continue to gain weight until this happens or you start burning more calories through exercise, or you stop taking in so many calories. if you do reach a point where you're burning just as many calories as you're eating, you will stay the same weight. you cannot begin to lose weight until you start eating fewer calories that you are burning.  unfortunately as you get heavier, you usually become more sedentary, so the extra base calorie consumption from having a bigger body is mitigated by reduced activity. therefore, continuing to consume the same amount of calories will likely continue to result in weight gain or at least maintaining the same weight.   if you're interested in putting some numbers to it, Google a site to look up your basal metabolic rate and then see how much it changes if your weight goes up to 300 400 or 600 pounds.  this is all spoken to my phone voice recognition so forgive me if there's any  lack of grammar"

They are also modified to be ""Roundup ready"", which means that when they are sprayed with an herbicide, it won't hurt the plant. As a result, they are being sprayed more and more.  One of the main problems with GMOs (in my eyes) is that we don't really know what we're doing. Even the tiniest mutation in genetics can alter someone completely. It only takes a tiny piece of DNA to be out of place to create disease and physical mutations. What genetically modifying food does is exactly this. It's moving around the DNA. We don't know how it's going to react in a new place. It may appear to be okay, but we don't know how it's going to affect our future generations by consuming these products (especially in such large amounts).    A recent study found that the hamsters fed with GM Soybean showed the growth of hairs inside the pouches of the mouth and the number of hairy mouthed hamsters was much higher in the third generation of GM soy fed animals than in others (Baranov et al., 2010).   PDF available here for anyone interested. Just did a general search for the hamsters (I heard it elsewhere before), and a final link to the PDF of the study.  *This is also true for organic fruits/vegetables, but they use organic pesticides/insecticides/herbicides so they are potentially less dangerous (and less effective) then chemical ones.  Hope this helps some."
TooAfraidToAsk,1kxuab,erath_droid,13,Fri Aug 23 18:30:03 2013 UTC,"One of the main problems with GMOs (in my eyes) is that we don't really know what we're doing.   Actually GMOs are the most studied crops ever consumed by humans or animals. Extensive studies and years of research have been done on GMO crops and established them as safe.  The alternative to moving single genes (which is highly regulated and studied) is to use radiation to mutate genes randomly and then plant and eat that mutant food. (Which is not regulated at all and can still be called organic.)   *This is also true for organic fruits/vegetables, but they use organic pesticides/insecticides/herbicides so they are potentially less dangerous (and less effective) then chemical ones.   Actually, most studies show that organic pesticides used on organic produce are just as toxic or more toxic than their synthetic counterparts. (The Bt toxin that Bt-corn produces is the same toxin that organic farmers spray all over their crops, by the way.)   Although humans are much bigger than what we are trying to kill, we're still consuming these pesticides in small quantities, but it does build up.   No, they don't. Glyphosate (Roundup) does not bioaccumulate in mammals (including humans) and has a moderately short half-life in the environment when used properly. (On a side note- the pesticides that glyphosate replaced have much longer half-lives in the environment and actually do bioaccumulate.)  Also, of the two PDFs you linked, the hair paper did not mention GMOs at all and the other one (which actually did cite sources) showed that practically every one of the studies found no difference between GMO and non-GMO diets on animals. (The few that did showed minimal differences that were questionably significant and concluded that further research was needed to eliminate other potential causes.)"

TooAfraidToAsk,1icszz,zifnab06,3,Mon Jul 15 19:44:15 2013 UTC,Not happy. Haven't been for the last 5 years. I can't see any change in that either.
TooAfraidToAsk,1icszz,oblivionapc,3,Mon Jul 15 18:59:17 2013 UTC,"I was happy, truly happy about 2-3 years ago. I had a shit job, lived with my parents, and not much room for improvement. But what made me happy was a girl, the first girl I had ever found and that felt the same for me as I did her. It was a long distance thing and rough, but I loved it, finally being happy. It ended up not working out, me and her are still on fairly good terms and all that. I got a better job, moved out on my own and life has been getting better slowly. However, I've only ever had that one girl (had to even call her a girlfriend, it was more a fling than anything else) and I really miss that connection. Worse is I feel like I'll never have it again. Wish I could, but something bigger than me always gets in the way.  So, I was happy even though life sucked, now life's better and I wouldn't say I'm happy but at least content."

As for plunging, maybe try working on your technique when the toilet isn't clogged so you can get some practice. What you want to do is get it at an angle so it gets a nice seal around the plunger, then just push. If you're doing it right, you should be able to drain all the water with the plunger."

Not to mention the possibility of needing a restraining order because a violent stalker is following you & causing damage everywhere you go: losing your job  because they're showing up at your workplace, having to move because they've tracked your personal cell number back to your home address, or having them go after your family.

One of my friends was deported after he talked shit about the university in which he taught (yes, he is not a smart man). 14 police officers came knocking on his door, took his passport through force, stamped a 'cancelled' stamp on his visa and gave him a 2-day visa on the spot. Just long enough for him to pack his stuff and leave.  Another one of my friends had to leave the country early after getting into a fight with another foreigner. Foreigner A was smart enough to search through foreigner B's stuff, put his hands on his passport and tear the page with the visa. He then walked to a police officer and told him to get a look at this strange guy cuz ""he looks like a famous dangerous guy"".  Even though foreigner B could claim good faith and had a photocopy of his visa, he had no other choice but to go and have a new one done. And in this situation, the only visa the govt gives you is a one month visa (at best) to leave the country.  The only thing that foreigner B could have done when discovering his visa was gone was to keep his passport in a safe at home and only walk around with photocopies of his passport + visa, hoping nobody would ask him any originals. Then at the end of his visa (if he remembers the date), he would have had to go to the Exit-Entry Bureau to get the 1-month exit visa (and eventually declaring his passport lost at the same time in order to buy himself 1 more month)  This being said, can you give us some more details?

I cannot use pads or liners on my period because the feeling makes me feel absolutely repulsive; I can understand why you wouldn't want to use liners.  I would recommend trying out the Diva Cup. I recently started using one of these and have fallen in love. There isn't the TSS risk, because it isn't absorbing your fluids, but you're still not leaking all over the place.

TooAfraidToAsk,1eh7zv,TheFallMan,74,Thu May 16 21:52:07 2013 UTC,"two VERY distinct issues:  1. traditional marketing of condom sizes - yes, this is nonsense. XL condoms really aren't that much bigger, and ""small"" condoms (called 'close fit' or 'snug fit') really aren't that much smaller  2. the fact that size matters, when it comes to choosing a condom - for both comfort, and safety. This is just math. The more latex has to stretch, the greater the force reciprocated back onto the thing causing it to stretch (the dick). Here's a SFW illustration of it. That's bad, when the force is too high. A difference in circumference (related to something called 'nominal width') of just a few millimetres, can mean the stretching force being reduced by a double-digit % - again, just math.  So, traditional condom marketing is bollocks. Getting the right size of condom for the dick using it, is most definitely not.  disc: I make 95 sizes of condom. Lengths from just 3"" up to 9.5"", and nominal widths of 41mm out to 69mm (vs 53-56mm for traditional condoms). You should also be aware that since 1993, no less than 11 independent clinical studies, all around the world, have identified ""fit"" issues that men have with traditional condoms, all concluding that 40-45% of men in any population will suffer at the hands of the marketing nonsense.   A growing body of evidence also links poor fit, with an increased chance of breakage (or slippage, for the smaller guys).   Why hasn't the industry changed? Well, it just so happens that making only a small number of sizes means manufacture is  quick, easy and most important of all... cheap.   This is before we talk about what happens for the guys who find a traditional condom is too big for them when unstretched. Latex can hardly shrink to fit. So it just slips, or falls off - which is clearly bad."

I got some lifestyles skyn large condoms and I was really surprised that they are at most 1/4"" wider. It made a huge difference though. It's a lot easier to maintain when your dick isn't getting squeezed so hard. It seems like the package is disproportionately larger.  Great business idea.

TooAfraidToAsk,1eh7zv,joetheyfit,5,Wed May 29 16:12:59 2013 UTC,"latex is the perfect material! we can make it just 45 microns thick (most condoms are around 70 microns) and when used correctly, with a water or silicone lubricant, it's extremely durable. It transmits heat, and sensation well - did you know, the latest fad in condom marketing (""feels like nothing at all"") is a material called polyisoprene. That happens to be.. that's right - latex! with the allergy causing bits removed).   It also comes from trees (near to most condom factories, the vast majority of which are in Malaysia or India, are huge latex plantations) meaning essentially an unlimited supply."

But you have demonstrated, with all due respect, a lot of ignorance (borderline conspiracy) in your ""points"":   Processing requires nasty chemicals such as carcinogenic formic acid, formaldehyde !!!, tetramethyltriuram disulphide (TMTD), nitrosamine, dimercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT), Zinc oxide and ammonia in third world conditions that generally amounts to slave labor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmLBOevKlfA   ISO 4074 stipulates the strict conditions that condoms have to manufactured in, in order to be saleable in developed countries. You may not be aware, but condoms are regulated medical devices, and they have to pass such regulations are the CE Mark in Europe, or the FDA (ASTM) controls in the US.   Zinc is considered toxic especially in food-contact applications and is a source of heavy metal in waste sludge and effluent water. As an alternative to the above, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ethanolamine, methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and propyl-4-hydroxybenzoate are sometimes used. Residues of these chemicals remain in the condom.   I'm just going to put this in the same box as ""vaccine conspiracy"", if that's okay? Ammonia, for example, softens up the molten latex prior to ""dipping"".   Latex allergies are very common and your risk increases with every exposure.   around 10% of people are allergic to latex, which is why we work hard on so called latex-free options. But you should be aware, the latest, polyisoprene, is actually latex but with the ""allergic-reaction-causing-bits"" removed   Durable? Hah! Latex breaks down in the presence of oils (even your skin's natural oils, to a degree), UV, oxygen. It simply isn't stable over time.   all modern condoms are tested to last 5 years in the foil, in sensible conditions. We're fairly sure we could push for 7 years, but better safe than sorry. You might not know, but a lot of condoms are manufactured up to 2 years prior to being foiled - at which point the 5 year clock starts ticking. The main degradation is caused by the interaction between the latex and the silicone lubricant. To test durability, we essentially use a big oven - so avoid heating your condoms to maximise their lifespan after purchase. As for 30 minutes of well lubricated rumpy pumpy? Extremely durable.   It tears or rips very easily. Tears propagate readily. Sizing condoms better would help but the material itself is a poor choice.   that's just nonsense. Cotton tears and rips easily, but still makes for a great clothing material. You just avoid tearing and ripping your clothes...   It has poor tensile strength.   it stretches to around 700% it's starting size   It does not transmit heat or sensation well - latex is an insulator.   it's an electrical insulator. At 70 microns thick, it transmits sensation just fine. The most common issues with condoms are actually related to size, not latex thickness (but people assume it is thickness.. explaining why ""thin"" condoms are such a lucrative market for condom manufacturers... hint: the difference in thickness between a thin condom and a regular one, is equivalent to about 1/5th the thickness of a human hair).   I understand you have a commercial interest in latex being the material of choice but it's certainly not the best. Cheap? Certainly. But perfect? Hardly.   It is a wonderful material for manufacturing prophylactics. And cost is super important in countries where ""retail"" is an unknown concept for acquiring condoms i.e. public health bodies distribute them for free to citizens. Modern condoms can be manufactured for pennies, to ultra high standards."
TooAfraidToAsk,1eh7zv,Calypsee,5,Fri May 17 15:55:15 2013 UTC,rumpy pumpy   Thank you.  [Also thank you for these informative posts! Came from /r/bestof :) ]
TooAfraidToAsk,1eh7zv,d__________________b,-6,Fri May 17 16:12:17 2013 UTC,"ALL LATEX PROCESSING requires nasty chemicals such as carcinogenic formic acid, formaldehyde !!!, tetramethyltriuram disulphide (TMTD), nitrosamine, dimercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT), zinc oxide and ammonia.  Period. You didn't even dispute that, you just mumbled something about immunizations (which are a good thing) and conspiracy theories and ISO 4074, which by the way talks about:  •Adequate protection against harsh environmental conditions  •Appropriate length, width and strength of the condom in relation to effectiveness, comfort and size  •Establishment of requirements for stability data (both real time and accelerated) to support stated shelf-life and expiry dates  •Allowance for inadequate systems of storage and distribution  •Appropriate packaging and information on how to use condoms  But doesn't talk about latex raw material procurement or processing techniques!  Being a regulated medical device or not, that doesn't change the chemistry of latex coagulation or the desire or need to use preservatives like formic acid, formaldehyde and ammonia.   Ammonia softens up the latex but it's still ammonia. Phthalates soften up PVC but that doesn't mean they are good for you.  Are you denying that carcinogenic formic acid, formaldehyde, tetramethyltriuram disulphide (TMTD), nitrosamine, dimercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT), zinc oxide or ammonia are commonly used to process latex?  Latex is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene, but all of the processing junk left in it is another story and all of the junk added to it is a whole 'nother story.   polyisoprene, is actually latex but with the ""allergic-reaction-causing-bits"" removed   Somewhat removed but other non desireables are still left in. Condoms tear and break. Sure, if you store them in a cool, dry space they are likely to retain their physical properties but they are still inherently flawed. They tear along molecular boundaries, being oligomers. How they tear and fail tends to continue propagating along the tear. Ever worn latex clothing? It's like a zipper.  Cotton tears and rips easily? Uhh, ever tried to rip canvas? It's 1000x as thick latex and still isn't easy. Ever tried to cut or tear cotton sheets with your fingernails? Now try it with latex.    You just avoid tearing and ripping your clothes...   Or your condoms. Or latex clothing. Avoiding is good but you don't make a boat out of tissue paper and hope to avoid water.   it stretches to around 700% it's starting size   That's elongation at break, not tensile. I thought you made and sold condoms? Some non latex rubbers hit 1200%. Latex has pretty terrible tensile strength. 14 MPa? Steels are ~ 800. Some urethanes push 50 MPa. That's over 7000 PSI.   At 70 microns thick   A human hair is ~ 100 microns. A typical atomic radius is of the order of 100 picometers. 100000000 picometer to 100 microns. 100 microns means there are 1,000,000 ""atoms"" (latex is a molecule but this is a back of the napkin calculation) of latex between the penis and any sensation. Woohoo, thin condoms - now only 800,000 atoms between the penis and any sensation. Latex monomers are springy, unlike stiff metal, so sensations are not easily transmitted between atoms of latex. That's why it is used to deaden sounds and quieting spaces - latex absorbs rather than transmits molecular motion.   it's an electrical insulator.   Yes and latex is thermally insulative too. Properties of Thermal Insulation from Durian Peel Fiber and Natural Rubber Latex Thermal conductivity measured in accordance with American Society for Testing Materials standard was found to be 0.026 W /m K with density of 143 kg m-3 which was close to the commercial insulator. The success of this study shown that the thermal insulation made from durian peel fiber and natural rubber latex exhibited a good thermal insulation and extreme potential to be used instead of the synthesis fibrous insulator.   Fiberglass batting has a 0.035 W/m·K, which is an R-value of 28.57. Latex in that study has a 0.026 W /m K value, which is a  R-value of 38.46!! Latex would actually be more than 33% better of an insulator than common fiberglass! Latex doesn't transmit sensations or heat very well at all!  I'm not saying latex isn't cheap. It is. But part of that is due to extremely poor labor conditions and the shitty low cost chemicals used to process latex. There are better materials out there but cost makes them less desirable.  If modern condoms can be manufactured for pennies, why do yours cost so much?"

For example, apparently there's loads of profit in condoms.. yet apparently it's also incredibly expensive to get them approved for sale (yes.. expanding the size range as we did involved a whole new approval process, which is still ongoing with the FDA after several years). Too expensive to even try and fix the apparent issue with using latex. So, damned if you do, damned if you don't. We wrote Gates asking for the money as we've already made a condom that men consider themselves more likely to want to use/wear (essentially what Gates is trying to do - improve usage rates).  Look into the German study (2012) re: carcinogens in (some) manufacturing techniques, of which the conclusion was not to stop using condoms, for example.   Look into the onshore manufacturing facilities that e.g. Trojan has, in the US (note, not all their facilities are in the US), for example.

Do you really think that a horse weighing 700-1000kg isn't able to defend itself? What about dogs with their sharp carnivore teeth and jaw pressure? If someone tried having sex with an animal and the animal didn't want it, the animal doesn't need to be able to explicitly say no. They'll just go ahead and kick, stomp, or bite. Or less drastically, just move away and reject the advance.  But then you get into the whole idea of people drugging or hobbling animals to rape them. That is fucked up beyond belief.  Anyway, I guess it's kind of a grey area. Like if you met someone at a club, and they were deaf/mute, and you didn't know sign language. If you went up and grabbed their junk, how would they communicate to you their consent or rejection?

It seems to me that if a critter shows no distress and is not being physically harmed, then there is moral latitude in how one interacts with it.  As for those who support research that involves the harm of animals. It seems to me, that they implicitly assent to the idea that animals may suffer for the benefit of humans -- whether that should be the testing of women's make-up, or the sexual release of some social misfit."

It makes no sense to me, that someone whose very demographic was oppressed for so long would be so like those who oppressed them. You use crass and rude words rather than express yourself calmly and logically.   And you know, I've long come to completely disregard societal views of weirdness. Just because it's the least logical way to oppose something.   ""Why don't you approve of interracial marriage?"" ""'Cause it's fuckin' weird. Them niggers shouldn't be doin' shit with white folk. It ain't natural and it ain't right.""   ""Why don't you approve of gays?"" ""Cause that shit just ain't right. A man and a man just do not belong together. Ain't natural. Do you see any other animals ever doin' that shit? No. The only natural relationship is between a man and a woman. Anything else is just damn weird and wrong.""  ""Why don't you approve of beastiality?"" ""Because that shit's fuckin' weird and unnatural. If you think a man fuckin' a dog isn't wrong you're a fuckin' dumb idiot who needs to shut his mouth. Shit ain't natural.""  I can see from your viewpoint why it's strange and even wrong. What I think you need to reconsider is the way you approach it. Strong moral beliefs have always existed, opposing this and opposing that. It is purely biased and does not attempt to look at it rationally. I do not claim to know everything, by any means. But the way I view it, is just like a human and a human. There are biological risks (like homosexuals and AIDS all over again), and of course there is the matter of mutual consent. If you are penetrating an animal purely to use it and pleasure yourself, that is equivalent to raping a human. However, I find that if a dog or even a horse mounts a woman (for example) and proceeds to vigorously penetrate her, there is hardly any lack of consent on the side of the animal. You may argue ""oh they just don't know what they're doing"", then it would seem you, too, assume things on the part of the animal.   I imagine you are not even going to finish reading all of this, and instead skip immediately to the comment box to enter your thoughts about how I'm deranged and a lunatic and have no idea what I'm talking about - which is why I'm putting this at the bottom. I welcome your input, as again I do not know everything and appreciate different perspective. But if you refuse to do so, how are you any better than any bigot whose only tools of expression for his feelings are yelling and rage, and who refuses to acknowledge any counter view?"

When you feel her jerking her hips toward you or moaning, keep that stroke and rythym. This is all for her pleasure, so you can't be greedy and fuck it up. Your tongue will hurt after a few minutes from the stroking. DO NOT STOP. Use your fingers to penetrate or help along her clit if your tongue needs a rest, but don't stop. Foreplay beforehand helps it go faster; petting, grinding, talking about what your going to do to her. Good luck! Oh, and if she asks don't ever tell her that she tastes like anything but fruit.

Sometimes slow and gentle the whole time is what a girl wants/needs.  Once you find a good motion, don't change it! Mixing it up constantly can make it difficult to get off. I lose the feeling if my SO changes it up when I am getting close.  Use one finger and curl it towards her G spot. Make sure you lick your finger first, all the way down to the knuckle!  Don't use just the tip of your tongue. Try to flatten and widen your tongue, so there is more surface area contact. There are nerve endings all over down there, not just the clit, so it feels good all over :)"

TooAfraidToAsk,1ef4t5,gbove,3,Thu May 16 00:57:30 2013 UTC,"I was actually in a house and I'm not much of a drinker (reasons at the bottom). Yes a lot of people gave me crap, but I just stood by my decision and moved on. Most of the time people don't really think twice about it.... some people even respect it (there are others like you/me/us).    Interestingly, I was scared/nervous to join a house bc of what I thought the stereotype was. I ended up being president in my Junior year and some (re: most) of my best friends are from the house. Houses also vary by campus and even on a given campus houses can differ a ton. There are tons of benefits w/ a house, but they aren't for everyone.  That being said, I have a bunch of great friends from clubs much like u/gbove said.   Ultimately you're not alone and it is important to find people w/ similar interest and values.  Reasons... I actually really enjoy the occasional night out, but three factors contribute in my disinterest on the whole: * I disagree w/ the mindset that one needs alcohol to loosen up * The cost of a drink at a bar is just not a good investment in my mind * Weight... always a fight and don't need the extra calories especially in addition to the previous points.

So, approximately 5% of the world population are native English speakers. Assuming that native English speakers represent the bulk of works published in English, it just seems unlikely that every other language's output of published works in the past ten years can't compete.   P.S. Listen to Thundercat, although I don't know what the deal with this video is.  Edit: For clarification.
