TryingForABaby,3e4htx,atlvulpix,5,Tue Jul 21 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"IIRC when you're on the pill it isnt a real ""menstrual cycle"" in the true sense, you only have a period because the withdrawal of hormones in the week off causes withdrawal bleeding.   What that basically means is, the pill stops you from ovulating, so you dont ovulate at all on the pill. So unfortunately your plan would not work."

TryingForABaby,3e4htx,urbaybeedoll13,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:31 2015 UTC,My OB dx'd me with possible PCOS but since I haven't been trying for a year yet we have to still wait to treat. What she did say though was that one of the treatments was to go on birth control for a month or two and then when you stop to immediately try because that is when you will be most likely to ovulate on your own.
TryingForABaby,3e4htx,Kelseyb,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:02 2015 UTC,"This makes sense. Thanks for your response! I am currently on the ""sugar pill"" week anyway.

TryingForABaby,3e4htx,Kelseyb,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:08 2015 UTC,"I would suggest temping. I didn't know about PCOS until I got off the pill late October. I don't ovulate. I don't have a cycle. I'm prescribed provera to regulate a cycle. Temping will help you find out if you ovulate, it's possible you're a late ovulator."
TryingForABaby,3e4htx,meaghanne,2,Wed Jul 22 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of doing this but I also thought, if I never see AF without the pill, does that mean I'm never ovulating? Or is it possible to ovulate and also not see AF?"
TryingForABaby,3e4htx,Jesb118,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:48:20 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct, if you ovulate, you will have a period. Some people who think they are anovulatory just ovulate really late. I went 180 days after getting off birth control without having a period. Got prescribed provera and started a new cycle. I started temping that cycle and thought I saw a normal temperature pattern so I didn't take my prescribed provera until I realized the cycle was dragging on and all the times my cycle looked normal it was just a coincidence. Now I temp and see that there's no pattern for ovulation, so I don't even waste my time with opks right now."

This cycle and last cycle my O days have been much later. They're generally around CDs 11 - 13 but now they're between CDs 18 and 23. Bizarre. OPKs have helped. CM has been different too. Both this and last cycle have been the only ones with more than a day of EWCM. I have my fertility specialist appointment in 7 days so we'll see if anything happens before then. I'm not holding my breath though.  Edit to add: I've also noticed that my BBT is much higher than what it was 6 months ago. Maybe the thyroid meds are kicking in. It was usually below 36C with pre O temps (regularly hovering around the 96.5F mark).

So the fact that you havent gotten pregnant while on the pill is no indication what so ever that youll neber be able to get pregant. The likely hood of you not having any eggs is rare. People with pcos have eggs. If youre not ovulating your dr will probably prescribe clomid to help.

Typically women ""even out"" to a regular cycle in their 20s, but it is difficult to tell when people are on a birth control pill for that period of time.    And anovulatory (or even long, unpredictable cycles) don't really tell you if you can't get pregnant.  A friend of mine had 3 month long cycles and got pregnant within 3 weeks of trying.    The pill is pretty darned effective.  About 95% of women who use the pill perfectly for 16 years have NO PREGNANCIES.  So basically, the pill worked as expected.  Even if you do have PCOS, you can still get pregnant, you might just need some pharmaceutical support (but that's for your OB to decide!)"

After our test (if it's negative) we will look into my hormone levels throughout my cycle and whether other drugs can help.   I'm pretty sure my husband is the issue though. He has cut out smoking weed and the doctor says it takes 72 days for new, healthy, less spazzy sperm to develop. So we are going to skip next month and do cycle monitoring again in September if we are still trying then.   Good luck with your wait! Try to think period until pregnant, not pregnant until period.

To avoid long term damage to anything vital, you need to make sure you get help in time.  Sharp pains without clear reason = doctor.  I don't mean to scare you, and you'll probably be fine, but in instances like this - better safe than sorry!  This is something you don't want to look back on and wish you had gone sooner. I would go to the ER or try to find a doc that would see me ASAP."
TryingForABaby,3dy9l0,MoodyMoose,5,Mon Jul 20 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you are really concerned about cost, I would try to get an appointment with your general physician as they might be able to see you sooner. But barring that just go to the ER."

Believe me, I understand that it very often is, especially when so many of us are scrimping every penny for fertility treatments etc., but try to remember that you come first.  Remember, hospitals will work out payment plans. We even recently found that the hospital my husband went to several months ago has a charity program people can apply for that often knocks half or more off the bill depending on circumstances-- just ask what your options are! It is worth getting help as immediately as the situation dictates; the money will work out somehow.  Good luck OP; I hope it's nothing serious."

As long as you are using PPE and a good fine hood, you should be fine with your basic organic solvents.  If you have any concerns, read up on the MSDS or chat with your safety officer. The good thing about TTC is we know exactly when we get pregnant and can let people know.  I know it's a personal decision, but when you do get a BFP, I would let either your boss or safety officer know because there may be special things that will need to be taken into account then. For example,  I used to work in a radiochem lab and then dais to lay them know if I got pregnant because there it's a lot lower radiation allowance for pregnant women (i.e. they would get me out of the lab)."

I've worried a lot about this and in the end, I'm pretty ok with staying in the lab with some minor accommodations.   This is what i've learned/my experience.   My OB/GYN was entirely unsympathetic and made me feel pretty terrible about the entire situation - she was 100% get out of lab! But i am the sole wage earner in my family and I spent my 20's training for this so ummm...yeah... no!  The nurse at work was a much greater resource in terms of what my resources and options were.   Are you in academia or industry?  If you are in industry you should have a reproductive health OSHA representative who can go through your lab with you and discuss risks and reasonable accommodations.  (Maybe you chose to wear a respirator, or a higher rated PPE and avoid specific solvents or reagents.  For example, decrease chloroform and acetonitrile exposure).   The company has no requirement to accommodate you while you are TTC . Talk to your supervisor.  I have a few papers that I'm putting off writing as long as possible so that I can minimize lab exposure early in the first trimester, because that's actually when I worry the most, up until balance and reach become compromised.

So those weren't ""your"" cycles, if you know what I mean.   There is no way of telling yet how long your cycles will be after bc, because it takes a while to settle in.  But more importantly: luteal phase has nothing to do with cycle length.  In a 28 and a 35 day cycle, your lutea lphase will still be more or less the same, you just ovulate earlier.  Cycles vary - the luteal phase does not."
TryingForABaby,3dxu0e,MoodyMoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:08 2015 UTC,"That's what worries me,  my last cycle FF said I ovulated insanely late CD 29, and then AF came only six days later (I have doubts that that was when I actually ovulated though) meaning I only had a six ay luteal phase.    If my cycle is its correct length then my luteal phase will be fine at 12 days, but since I'm not really sure how long my LP should be I'm kind of worried its not going to be long enough (I didn't track very well my first cycle so I have no idea how long that one really lasted)"
TryingForABaby,3dxu0e,MoodyMoose,3,Mon Jul 20 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly think FF is wrong, for one reason or another.  Maybe you didn't ovulate at all, given that you've just come off BC.  Do you temp? FF can only guess, and with insufficient data, those guesses are about as good as a semi random guess.   You say ""if my cycle length is at its correct length"" - that really isn't how it works. The length doesn't have anything to do with the luteal phase at all, like I mentioned.  No matter the length of your cycle, luteal phase is a separate thing, and it should always stay the more or less same.   Plus, there is no reason to worry about anything until you've been off bc for at least six months. It can take up to a year for the body to get back in the game. Anything weird going on now can, and should be attributed to BC.  Weird cycles are normal and extremely common after getting off hormonal bc.  Therefore, unfortunately there is no way of knowing how long your luteal phase is until you have had several normal non-post bc cycles.   But most likely: everything is just fine.

And most of the things you've made yourself worry about are not real. Yes, you had one - ONE - weird cycle. Most people have one weird cycle a year even if they haven't gotten off BC.  Sometimes they are freakishly long, sometimes they are freakishly short, and sometimes there is no period, just weird spotting.  Bodies are strange, and they will do weird stuff, especially after taking strong hormones for a long time.   You need to talk yourself down instead of further into the fear-loop ;-) Tell yourself to calm down and stop finding reasons why something is wrong!

In my experience of coming off the pill, things can seem to be normalised and then suddenly go out of whack. It really does take a while for your hormones to normalise again - you really have nothing to worry about right now.   Anyway - a 'normal' LP is anything between 10 and 16 days, so a 12 day LP is nothing to worry about.

While it's too early for implantation for me, I was curious if hormone increases could be to blame. However, I just started keto a few weeks ago, which has diarrhea as a symptom as well. Hopefully it means good things for you!"
TryingForABaby,3dxso0,lkSmash,2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"In your case I think the keto is to blame.  Typically, progesterone decreases GI activity. Hence pre-menstrual constipation and then the ever lovely period shits (since progesterone has decreased)."

TryingForABaby,3dv418,hopefuldreamer82,4,Sun Jul 19 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily uplifting, but I was curious so I made this graph. This is the cumulative yearly probability of achieving pregnancy given different per-cycle probabilities. A couple of notes:   An average, healthy couple has a 33% chance of getting pregnant in a typical well-timed cycle. An average, healthy couple has a 20% chance of getting pregnant in a typical NTNP cycle. Those with lower fertility might have a smaller monthly chance that's still not zero, e.g., maybe you have a 10% chance, or a 5% chance each cycle. These numbers assume that the couple is using the same TTC strategy every month and that their per-cycle chances stay the same over time (in practice, for most of us the chances go down as we get older, and if you seek fertility treatment then the chances go up - so this is assuming no medical intervention)   As the graph shows, even those (like myself) who seem to have a lower per-cycle probability of getting pregnant still have decent cumulative chances over a couple years of TTC.   You can also see that those with ""normal"" chances have over a 95% chance of becoming pregnant after a year, but not 100%. So in a chatroom with 100 members whose fertility is normal, 1-2 might still not be pregnant after a year.  On the lower side of things (where I have my eyes set lately), it also seems like there's a huge difference between 1% and 2% per-cycle chances in terms of the cumulative odds of getting pregnant during the 10 year or so window that most people have to conceive. So when they say 1-2% chances per cycle, those numbers are not equivalent!  Again this is not meant to be uplifting, necessarily. Just food for thought because I've been doing a ton of back-of-the napkin calculations of my chances lately and wanted to see things laid out plainly."

TryingForABaby,3dvna9,missammyy,4,Mon Jul 20 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry about the situation, and I see how that can be frustrating!  The libido thing - I have no idea what to do about that.  The first advice I give will always be: talk to him. Tell him about your wants and needs. But if that doesn't help, I have one less ""traditional"" piece of advice.  I'm a pragmatic, and I aim straight for the goal, so if this is a bad idea/inappropriate - let me know. Here goes: even though you cannot change his libido, you CAN get pregnant without actually having sex. If he masturbates now and then, he can give you a sample? Or maybe if that is less stressful for him, he can be encouraged to do so? That would fix the pregnancy bit, at least.  And if he doesn't want to, at least he'll understand your predicament. Maybe he'll understand better what this all means, if you present it to him like that? You know him and yourself, so you'll know if this could work or not.  I'm a random internet stranger, so if this idea is offensive: ignore me.   Maybe this isn't a viable solution for you, but I have actually heard people mention that they've done just that. Some just feel the pressure a bit too much because ttc makes it more ""serious"", and I know that solution has been used in such situation.   I hope you figure it out. :-)"

OPK's (ovulation predictor kits) can help in conjunction with temping to figure out when you ovulate. You'll want to have sex during that time to increase your chances. I see Wondfo opk's mentioned frequently.  Most people around here also seem to use Wondfo pregnancy tests. You can buy them in bulk on Amazon pretty cheaply and they're reasonably sensitive. I think a 50 count was about $18 last month.  Basically, temp to get an idea of your cycle, use OPK's to verify when you're most fertile, and test when you expect your period.

And it's not just my mom, either. We've all been told that it is dangerously easy to get pregnant. They've scared us into thinking that missing one pill is LIKELY to get us pregnant. No wonder all that fear leads us to believe that getting pregnant will happen once you stop birth control.   The odds of conceiving are 20-25% chance per month. And those are the odds for perfectly healthy individuals with perfect timing. I repeat those odds to myself all the time.

I learned that I rather have to cancel it and forfeit the money than keep missing out on activities and keep becoming more bitter. It was nice to have things to look forward to again."

It implies that someone can't conceive because they're not relaxed (aka they're doing something wrong. They're failing. )  Generally struggles with conceiving come down to a medical issue that isn't always easy to pinpoint. The heartache of repeated BFN's is amplified when people act like it's no big deal and you just have to 'relax' to make a baby. Just my two cents though."

Five long hard heartbreaking years. Everyone kept telling us to relax...which made us feel so much worse. Like people were implying we were doing it wrong or something. I know it may sound a tad over sensitive but really it's a sensitive topic and who can be rational staring down the seemingly hopeless barrel of infertility. I know my friends always meant well, of course, but I always tried to politely tell them it was just the wrong thing to say.

That, paired with the fact that there is always variability from test to test, is why I really recommend you step away from the pee sticks for a day or two (or even more...) and try again when you're closer to 11 or 12dpo. That way you don't have to be squinting or going cross-eyed to see the result. It's not worth the frustration!  At 8dpo, two-thirds of women who ended up being pregnant had negative HPTs (source).  By the time you get to 11dpo, almost 80% of women who were pregnant got positive HPTs (source).  As someone who tested at 7dpo and was confused, frustrated, and pissed off... then tested again at 11dpo and got a glaring positive that required no squinting, photo doctoring, or cross-eyed interpretation whatsoever... I really do recommend waiting a few more days before you test again."
TryingForABaby,3dqzps,UnicornToots,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely would never expect to get a strong positive at 7 or 8DPO (which is what I mistakenly thought I was at - did not realize it was only 6, or else I wouldn't have tested). My last pregnancy I got a faint BFP on 8DPO, which I know is very early. It doesn't happen all the time, but if you implant early (again, not the norm) then you can get an earlier BFP.   I understand the implantation and subsequent HCG doubling that happens leading to BFPs at different days, and I know that it is MUCH more normal for a BFP not to show up until 12 or 13 or 14 or even later DPOs. As I said earlier, 9DPO is the most common day for implantation, so it wouldn't be until days later that an HPT could pick up the HCG levels.   I was just confused at getting a faint pink line one night, then having my blood test reveal nothing the next day. Evaps are not normally pink, so I did not think that it was an evap."

TryingForABaby,3dqzps,lindsayblowhan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"Because (as I said somewhere in that wall of text lol) I had miscalculated my DPO and thought that I was either 7 or 8DPO instead - I did not realize at that time I was only 6DPO. I don't know how I made such a stupid mistake but that is why I tested. My last pregnancy I got my faint positive at 8DPO, which I know is earlier than others."

TryingForABaby,3dqzps,YoshiSparkle,2,Sat Jul 18 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. I do like to test early, but getting a BFN doesn't bother me or stress me out. In this situation, I was only stressed because I got what appeared to be a faint BFP and then the next day nothing. After going through a CP those fading lines are stressful, and that is what I thought was happening. Had I never gotten that faint line on Thursday, I would have been 100% not stressed or sad at all.   I know that 8DPO is earlier than most people like to test, but that is the day I got my first BFP, so it can definitely happen. There are also a couple others who within the past couple weeks have gotten their faint BFP on 7DPO - crazy early!! I know it's not the norm and it doesn't happen a lot, but sometimes it does."

For instance, the hcg shows up in your blood faster than in your urine, so a bhcg could show a >25 result while urine tests are still negative.   On the other hand, even if you have a low level of hcg in your blood, it can (and will) accumulate in your bladder the longer you hold your pee, so you could build up a higher level in that urine sample than you have currently in your blood.

My sister found out she was pregnant four weeks later, by a guy who was constantly cheating on her and isn't even in the picture now. My parents financially supported her through everything and she was getting handed things left and right..things she was so ungrateful for.   It was hard. I watched her belly grow as I tried for months on end to get pregnant again, but it just didn't happen. She had her baby girl a month after my due date. I was in the hospital room with her, rubbed her back, held her hand through the contractions and watched her baby being born. After it was all done and we were about to go home, I broke down. I cried so hard, I'm sure people thought someone I loved at the hospital had died. I got pregnant with my son three months later.   Life isn't fair, but I love my niece to pieces.

None of the kids knows for sure where they live, cause they keep getting shuffled around... And so many good people are stuck with fertility issues or other issues preventing them from having any at all.... Sometimes that just makes me rage a bit....

TryingForABaby,3dol22,mutha_fucking_nature,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of the above. I have a friend who was nursing her 9 month old and she'd gotten her cycles back (though they weren't super regular), had gotten a positive opk and is pregnant with #2! I think the return of your period would be the biggest indicator of you getting more regular again and fertility...but you don't necessarily have to give up nursing to do so. I think it varies widely from person to person, so YMMV. Best of luck!"
TryingForABaby,3dn13o,fluffybunny125,4,Fri Jul 17 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand how stressful and overwhelming and unfair all of this is. On the positive side, however, you are very lucky that your doctor is taking action! Doctors generally don't do a thing with fertility issues until the 1 year mark.   Did your doctor say you have PCOS?   My SIL has been trying for 15 months and is seeing a fertility doctor now (she also has mild PCOS), and she's on her second cycle with Clomid. Her doctor doesn't fuck around with things, so after their first cycle didn't result in pregnancy, they're doing IUI for this next one.   I would say to wait on the Clomid until you get your test results back. Blood work is important, as is an HSG, but ultimately a diagnosis of PCOS could determine your situation.   Best of luck with everything!!!"
TryingForABaby,3dn13o,jacobbaby,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"There was no mention of PCOS and I don't really have any of the classic signs. I know it's still possible to have it. I was on birth control pills for almost 12 years (first for acne, then birth control) so I have NO IDEA what my normal cycles are. So frustrating to feel so out of touch with your body. The first four months off birth control this year were longer, but seemingly normal cycles so I had high hopes for an easy road to getting knocked up. Haha"
TryingForABaby,3dn13o,lkSmash,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"The testing can be overwhelming, and the results can definitely have you over-analyzing every little thing (at least, I know I did.) I'm a little concerned that your Gyn wants you to go on Clomid right away without knowing the results of your testing first, unless he/she is just saying that this is the probable course of action. If so, it's awesome they're being so proactive.   I have experience with all of the testing, although I have PCOS, so I'm not sure if you're being tested for the same things. Did your OB/Gyn also suggest getting testing done on your SO? I got referred to an RE (fertility clinic), which my insurance covers some of due to my pre-existing condition, and they've been wonderful about testing and treatment. I've done Femara and various supplements, and the waiting is tough, and having sex at certain times/days kind of takes the romance/fun out of it.   Clomid has a higher risk of side effects and multiples, so you may want to inquire about Femara or other avenues. Some doctors have a strong preference in either direction, so just make sure you feel comfortable talking to your doctor. Good luck!"
TryingForABaby,3dn13o,fivefuzzieroommates,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"She made it sounds like Clomid would be the way to go after tests come back and I don't have an obvious issue like blocked tubes or anything. No mention of testing the SO, probably since the most obvious issue is my long/anovulatory cycles? She said you normally try Clomid for 6 months at the most, then I would need to be referred to a RE after that if I'm not pregnant.   I asked about the risks of Clomid, especially multiples, and she said while it's a possibility, she considers it low, especially with the low dose I would potentially be on. Which is interesting because a friend just went through some of this, and her Dr. actually prefers to go with Femera first because multiples is a higher risk pregnancy that she thinks is better avoided if possible. Ugh. So many different opinions. Thanks for sharing your experience with testing!"

First cycle my boobs hurt like a mofo (I felt like my nipples were bleeding every time I dried off from a shower) and the second cycle (which was 15 f***ing days of Clomid because my ovaries stopped responding) I was SOOO emotional.

TryingForABaby,3do10j,IVGreen,5,Fri Jul 17 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"The weightloss issue is close to my heart, so I want to say something about that! I really want you to succeed with that, and I agree that it is likely to help all your other issues. It might not fix them, but it is likely to help :-)  As far as weightloss goes, the one thing that always helps is counting calories. I know there are many diets out there, and I know keto is popular atm, but whatever diet you are on - if you are taking in more than you are burning, you still won't lose the weight. Not permanently. Eating healthy is good, but it's not enough. Nuts are healthy, but cashews have more than 600 calories pr 100 grams. This means that a large handful of them ""costs"" you 1/4 of your daily needs. (If your needs are 2000 calories)   And now the 2000 calory thing. Most labels cite that an adult needs 2000 calories. This is not true for most of us women unless we exercise a lot, or are very tall or very heavy. The more mass we have, the more we burn, basically.   If you count everything that goes in. And measure how much goes out - you will lose weight. You just need to make sure that you are taking in things that you like, in sufficient amounts so that you can keep doing it forever. Because this is not a diet, this will have to be a permanent change. :-)  If you commit 100% to learning about food, and the number of calories in that food, calculate EXACTLY what you have been eating. Then you will lose the weight.    This comes from personal experience. I liked to believe that I had special reasons for not being able to lose... It wasn't true. I calculated every little bit of food going into my mouth for two weeks, and I was brutally honest about how much I moved.  Turned out I was eating 200 calories to much every day. That is not much. That is the equivalent of a small sandwich...  So when I said: ""I don't eat that much"" I was telling the truth! I wasn't a slob. I was eating a tiny amount too much... But over time it added up... And it's hard to lose once it has added up...   So I started doing the math honestly every day. And it worked.  I actually looked at serious studies trying to disprove the calories in calories out-math.... Honestly...The studies show that calories in/calories out is the most reliable way to lose weight.  There are many bloggers who (for some odd reason) will have you believe that there are studies showing the opposite, but there aren't.  They keep citing correlation not causation etc, and that ""nothing is proven"". That is a lie...I've checked. There are so, so many studies that show causation.  Also, a lot of bloggers will also say that only 5% of weightloss is successful long term. That was so demotivating for me. It is true. BUT the same is true for smoking. 5% are able to quit....! Yet, hardly anyone smokes anymore.  I quit. Permanently.   You can be in the 5%. That 5% only shows ONE try per person. Large scale studies don't follow the subjects second or third try. It doesn't take into account that most of us try again when we fail. Eventually we figure it out, and we push through!  I don't know much about metformin. It might make it easier, and if your doctor recommends it - go for it. I've heard many people say it has helped them.  But the crucial issue is still diet and exercise, because that is what will help you for the rest of your life - and you childrens lives. :-)  You can do it!!! :-)"

TryingForABaby,3do10j,MoodyMoose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"Just based on my own experience, I truly, honestly believed I was eating 1500 calories. I even counted. I just didn't count closely enough, and I underestimated my cheat days. I'm not saying that is what is happening here. We are all different, but one must concider the possibility that there is miscounting or misunderstandings at work.  Foe example, I estimated the calory count of a slice of cheese, and other little things like that. Weighing them opened my eyes. I weighed the bread. Then I weighed the cheese. Then I measured exactly how much milk I had. And 5, 10, 15 extra calories started creeping up from all those little things, and it added up to more than 200 a day. It is so easy to miss something.   I'm guessing the nutritionist makes you do a food diary to check that the goal is being met? Do you log absolutely everything there? Even everything you drink?   I'm not accusing you of miscounting, but it is the number one reason why diets fail - misreporting. If that is not the case here, then I apologize, but I think it must be mentioned since it is so very common.  That's what happened to me as well. As sure as I was that it wasn't."

So far I haven't gotten pregnant yet, but I have ovulated without issue since starting the metformin / losing weight. That of course means I have to temp and opk and chart and all the rest because otherwise I would have no idea when I ovulated (or if I did, thank you temperature rises). Side effects from metformin are common, but you adjust with time. Usually they involve washroom issues. Not. Fun. Some women have harsher effects than others. As long as I stay on keto I don't have issues, but if I swap off, I tend to run back into the washroom issues. I've been trying for 7 cycles, about to start my 8th tomorrow.

I finally got AF and it was basically two days long and super light. Then my second cycle was about 39 days, AF was also around two days and light. Shortly after my first crazy ""cycle"" ended she did an ultrasound and it looked like at the time I wasn't O'ing. I don't have PCOS, but it just didn't look great. She told me to start Vitex. Since then I had two 28-day cycles and one 24-day cycle.

Are you temping or using OPKs to pinpoint ovulation? Temping is really the only way to guarantee you O'd, and on a specific day, so without that, there's really any number of things that could be going on :) Don't fret about it.

It could be a number of innocent things that cause it to happen. Four days late is very little. That is within normal variation of a cycles that are concidered regular. So, this cycle is still regular, actually.  You could just have had an anovulatory cycle. This is normal. It happens now and then. That will often make the cycle longer or shorter. A breakthrough bleeding will occur, or you'll skip it altogether.   You could have a corpus luteum cycst. Completely harmless. Usually resolves on its own with a few weeks, but  it can delay your period by several weeks.   These things are normal. I think you might need to take a deep breath and chill out. Your body is not a machine. 4 days isn't even outside the most normal norm. If you get worked up about this, then ttc, pregnancy and...life...is going to become unbearable.

I am no expert in bio chemistry)  There are actually multiple ""variants"" of the hormone. I am not sure, but I think it might just be called an androgen in the form. But they aren't just measuring a single level of testosterone. What they want to know, is the level of FREE testosterone. They calculate your free testosterone this way: total testosterone divided by sex hormone binding globulin [SHBG] Ã— 100.  Complicated....So what they are measuring is SHBG and androgens and then calculating how much free testosterone you are likely to have in your blood based on your other values. The free testosterone is what matters, because that is what is ""free"" to circulate and cause physical effects.   I am not a bio chemist or a lab tech, so I really don't know anything for sure. So the testosterone bit might be hidden in the other results, or the results might be lumped together as an androgen index, or just be called ""androgen-somethings"".  I don't know if they measure DHT for PCOS, but that is also a form of testosterone. The one that causes male baldness, in fact.

I guess you could compare it to the punt at the bottom of a wine bottle, with the vagina being the inside of the wine bottle? You can also see this tapered nature on diagrams of the female reproductive system. Also, the vagina is quite stretchy, so moving around the cervix isn't super hard.  Can you feel a (tiny) opening on what you suspect is your cervix?

TryingForABaby,3di296,rabidsmiles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"First of all, the cervix moves positions on constant basis. Your cervix isn't the back wall, dead end like you'd logically think it is. It sits more on the top and back of the vaginal wall that stretches and moves it. There is room past the cervix, usually where the semen gets deposited/pools. So think of your vaginal canal as being a round tube. At the top of the tube wall (but not the very back end of the tube), towards the back, there is an opening that will move as the muscles that support it move. I dunno how clearer I can try to be? Hope I don't confuse you!   Your cervix should feel like you've placed your finger on a Cheerio, though a squishy one. Some days the opening hole will be tightly closed and you get almost no CM after touching it. Some days, the opening hole will feel larger and it will feel squishier, wetter...and the CM that you collect will be slippery and stretchy. After a while, you will get the hang of it!"

If I've learned anything from reading and participating in this subreddit is that even the healthiest woman having perfectly timed sex, with the perfect diet, and all the special ""hacks"" can still take a year or longer to conceive. For every ""instant baby"" post you see on Facebook, there's 10 more others secretly trying and hoping.  With how many people there are in this group, you're definitely not alone. We're right there with you asking ourselves WHY? After all that time preventing pregnancy, why is it so hard to actually get pregnant when you're ready? We didn't think there'd be any trying either, and here we are. 7 months later and not even the faintest illusion of a BFP.  I suggest you work on trying to track your ovulation.

When I first started this it was super confusing, but here is what helped me. Download fertility friend: it is free for the basic version and comes with email tutorials that they send you in 10-12ish emails. They walk you through the whole process and there are little quizzes you can take. Before doing this I had NO clue what my body did or what it was supposed to be doing.  Then once you have the basic tools you can start integrating them into your daily routine. I found there was so much that you could do from temperature taking to OPKs to cervical fluid to cervix position. That it was too much to start with. Right now I'm on cycle #1 and I'm temping and checking my cervical fluid, that's it.   There are a lot of other methods but right now it sounds like you aren't even sure when you ovulate. I think it's time to figure your cycle so you have the knowledge to understand if conception hadn't happened due to timing of BD (baby dancing) or something else."

I truly hope you get your BFP soon, and that you have a sticky bean which will continue to grow over the next 9 months until s/he comes out beautiful and healthy.  About your friendâ€”I feel that those comments are both rude and ignorant, considering what you're going through right now. I'm currently 13 weeks pregnant and I'm in my very early twenties so I've not experienced your situation of TTC, but I thought I'd say anyway that I completely understand the frustration you feel when people say dumb shit like that. My best friend's little family (her, her husband, and their 4-year-old son) were graciously invited to live with us for 2 whole months while they found their own place. Fiance and I were TTC in this time and were on our third cycle of trying, which my best friend knew about. When we found out we were pregnant after CD40something, my best friend's husband would say stupid, sarcastic remarks like ""Oh, kids. Aren't they great?"" and/or ""This is what you have to look forward to in a few months"" when their child was acting up. This annoyed both my fiance and me because although we're not parents yet so we can't say for sure how our children are going to behave, we truly believe that our kids are not going to be anything like theirs. We'll have entirely different parenting styles, after all.  It is my belief that while every child can be difficult at timesâ€”every human has their off days, so of course a little person with barely any life experience and a developing brain is going to have their momentsâ€”it is the parents and guardians that actually shape a child's behavior. We are the ones to help guide them into themselves, and unless they're neglected they're not going to just grow into problem behaviors on their own.  Anyway, I just thought I'd sympathize with you for those type of ignorant comments. The rest of your struggles I admit I cannot understand, but my heart still goes out for you. It must be even worse when you're TTC and people are seemingly trying to turn you away from having kids in the first place.  Baby dust to you~"

I also have an aunt who keeps asking me ""if I don't want one of those"" whenever I get to hold a baby. I have wanted one for years, but knew I couldn't try due to our financial situation.  Everytime she has asked, I've just said ""oh, sure. Someday"". I wanted to cry and say ""you have no idea how badly I want one.

TryingForABaby,3degw6,LazyPancake,3,Thu Jul 16 10:26:32 2015 UTC,"It's hard, but remember - whatever we say, we say about ourselves.  So, when they're making those jokes, they're saying that they're uncomfortable.  They don't know how to react.  They wish they could give you their kids to help you feel better.  I mean, think about it, they're literally saying ""here, have my kids"" as a way to have you feel better about not being able to conceive.  To fulfill whatever desire it is that you have as being a parent.  Is it so literal?  Are they literally saying that?  No, but while we're in the act of interpreting things, we have a choice - we can choose to take it with a positive spin or a negative one.  But, I do know that you obviously get that they're not trying to hurt you.  I can see that.  I'm glad that you're not taking it personally, and as someone who tried for almost two years, I know how uncomfortable it can make you feel.  But just remember, they're uncomfortable to.  They are looking, and failing, to find words to comfort you because they truly feel empathy/sympathy for you.  If you carry that thought when thinking about it, knowing that your friends/family are desperately looking for a way to help, so much that they're fumbling and resorting to jokes, you'll take it much better.  You can even choose to say things like, ""You don't need to joke, it's okay.  I know it's uncomfortable when you know we're TTC, but I know you're here for me if I need anything.  You don't have to worry about making me feel better, just having you as a support is enough for right now.  Thank you for being helpful and supportive"".  I know that sounds contrived, but saying that will ease your discomfort, and while it may put them slightly out of it, they'll realize that they don't have to joke about it.  They can just be there for you.  Without being confrontational, you've asked them to stop.  And you've identified what you want them to continue doing.  Take all of this with the knowledge that I am trying to be helpful.  I cannot control the way you will interpret what I say, but I can only express that helpfulness is the sole intent and desire I have in making this comment.

TryingForABaby,3ddurt,mc2385,2,Wed Jul 15 21:39:36 2015 UTC,"Folate and folic acid are basically the same thing. The difference is that Folate is found naturally in things like vegetables while Folic Acid is a man-made derivative of Folate. While Folic Acid is fine to take, Folate is more natural, the body can absorb it better and may be safer for some. Some studies/articles I've read have linked Folic Acid (not Folate) in larger doses to be harmful to the body and statistically increased some rates of cancer. Additionally large amounts of Folic Acid can mask a deficiency of B vitamins. Overall, it seems that a small supplementation of Folate in addition to getting Folate naturally through vegetables and leafy greens is the best practice.   Now I'm saying this based on my research and reading. I am not a scientist or doctor, so I recommend doing your own research as well."
TryingForABaby,3ddurt,jicklegirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:31:21 2015 UTC,That all makes sense. I try to eat a lot of foods that have folate in them. I really would like to find a prenatal that does not have folic acid in it at all. I've not found a good one with folate.

Folate is actually what you should be taking instead. I'd suggest reading this article by Chris Kresser, but essentially, folic acid is the synthetic form of folate. Its not as easily absorbed and its not good in higher doses.  Because folate is rather difficult to find in prenatals, I get my prenatal multis on Amazon, as well as additional folate tabs and my DHA/EPA.  All three can be taken together and on an empty stomach. The multi is 3 times a day, folate and DHA once a day. DH and I have just recently started TTC, and I've been on this prenatal regimen for almost 6 months now. This combo of prenatals haven't made me nauseous or burped, although I do take the DHA with lunch, so that could be why. I WILL say the multis have a grassy/earthy smell to them, but I really like that the ingredients are natural and none of the synthetic stuff you usually find.  I got all this info from my SIL who now has a perfectly healthy 1 year old beautiful baby girl.

Polyps can be malignant or benign, though most are usually benign.  I'm sure they just want to confirm that it's benign before you start/continue TTC.  It may need to be removed depending on the findings.  I would definitely discuss the MTHFR deficiency with your doctor as you should rule out whether you're a carrier or you have the condition.  (I can't tell from what's written.)  Having the condition is much more serious as far as TTC is concerned because it puts you at a higher risk of recurrent miscarriage and neural tube defects should you become pregnant.  There are some different things that can be done if you have the condition to help you TTC.  Sorry, I wish I had better news for you, but that's what I understand from your test results.

Whatever happened before certainly doesn't count towards this cycle, since you were still on the pill.  You're just waiting to ovulate for the first time after coming off BC - it can take a while and it's perfectly normal. Personally I had my first period almost 3 months after stopping BC, some women ovulate two weeks later as if nothing happened, and everything inbetween is also normal. And impossible to predict.  Also, OPKs don't 100% predict ovulation - your body can gear up for ovulation (positive OPKs, fertile CM), then ""give up"" for some reason (no follicle becomes dominant, for instance), then try again a bit later. Only a sustained temp shift can confirm ovulation. Positive OPKs basically just tell you ""you may ovulate tomorrow"", but it's never guaranteed."

Since you can have multiple surges, it's impossible to know which one is legit. This cycle I had 6 days of positive tests, and I have no idea which day I ovulated, or if I even did. And I wish I had temped or just not used them alone. They only indicate that it ovulation somewhat likely to happen, but there are no guarantees without temping to confirm. I don't want to sound negative, but just warning you that you might end up with more questions than answers :-P   Of course, you could be lucky and they work perfectly and show you a nice, predictable surge.

TryingForABaby,3ddy9t,motheroffurbabies,7,Wed Jul 15 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"If the test is not calibrated for blood, then it might not work. I know that urine samples have half the levels of hcg compared to a blood sample, so if the test is supposed to pick up very low levels of hcg, then it might give off false positives when exposed to blood. Or, you might get an ""evap"" effect, where the test line absorbs the colour from the blood. This sounds like a potential answer, since the line faded. When the line reacts with the dye in the test, it gets darker - but if your blood pools in the indent instead - it would fade. Not trying to be a pessimist, but that could be why. Hope that's not the case!! Hope you get your BFP :-)"

TryingForABaby,3ddu9u,firemonkee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"Me too. Many.  But those stories are anecdotal.  They could have conceived inspite of low levels? This is not impossible, just less likely. Or the nipples could be sore due to changes caused by the concption itself? Or maybe they are the rare exeptions? I'm not saying this is the case. I'm merely sepeculating.  Without a large scale, detailed study it's impossible to say.  But this woman is making a scientific claim, and that means she should have something more substantial to back it up. And I am wondering if she actually does. Is she speculating, or does she have good evidence to support this claim?   If it has merit, then it might provide valuable information.  I just like exploring the scientific value of all the information out there so I know what I am dealing with, since there is so much to sift through.

Kind of freaking out because if my ovaries are following a L/R pattern, this is Righty's go and last time she needed to step up to the plate I had a cycle without a perceptible LH surge (April 19th chart) and with no mittelschmerz followed by a sad little 14 day cycle (May 16th) (I was using a different app at that point so forgive the scant charts!). I started taking vitex this month because I wanted to try to correct that from happening again, but now I'm worrying that I fucked everything up.  I mean, FSH and LH are brain hormones so there's no reason that the side of ovulation would have any effect on whether or not they were produced during a month...right? All other signs still point to still being fertile -- CF's still nice and stretchy, cervix is soft (so mamma's getting herself some tonight! mmmm hmm!) but I'm just...  WHERE ARE YOU MY EGGY?"

TryingForABaby,3d9dlt,TheeTreeThree,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:58 2015 UTC,Nice stable chart though! I'm jealous! Is it true that it goes from the left to the right ovary and then back to the left? Or does it just select the dominant follicle (no matter what side it is on)?   I suppose your eggs are still having a fight off which one is dominant? Hopefully you see that positive OPK soon!

I use the Terumo Lady C thermometer and because the instructions are all in Japanese I didn't know that there was a precision read option if you left the thermometer in after the initial 20 second quick read. Huge difference in the stability of my temps and I feel a lot more confident with a 3-5 minute read rather than a 20 second one.  TBH I'm not completely sure if there is a general pattern in the population at large, but mine seem to be rather orderly in their production pattern. I've read a few articles that seem to suggest exactly what you're saying about it just being a dominant follicle thing.

Yea I also read that sometimes it can also be that there is a dominant one but that it dies before the release and then a new one needs to be selected.

TryingForABaby,3dag8n,CrashyTitan,8,Tue Jul 14 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think your partner has a very good point. If you're going to start TTC for reals, then there are definitely some things that may be good to change. Sorry in advance for the wall of text!    Drink less. That doesn't mean go sober, it just means less. Not only will it save you $$, it'll make you and your partner healthier and increase chances of conceiving. I don't know how much is ""a lot"" to you, so it may not even be as bad as you may think. I, myself, definitely have a glass or 2 of wine a night, which some would even consider to be excessive. You don't have to cut everything out, but cutting back may be something to consider.  Cut out the weed. Or at least decrease it dramatically, and IMO I would not smoke if I were you, because you don't find out you're pregnant the moment it happens, so once you do that would mean baby may be getting a shit ton of weed in those early stages. Keep in mind that when people find out they're pregnant (generally 14 days after ovulation), you're already considered to be four weeks pregnant. My husband and I smoked weed for years (and him much, much longer), but both of us 100% stopped in January (when we started TTC) because we want to have a baby and do not want to be stoner parents. This will also help you save A TON of $$. We've been saving almost $400 a month since we stopped. Do you and your husband plan to smoke weed after your baby is born? If not, then it's probably best to start that transition now.  Do you have to cook expensive meals every night? I love to cook, and sometimes making a dish that requires a ton of special ingredients can really add up. But I seriously wonder what you could be cooking every night (or most nights) that would make things so expensive. Lobster? Filet Mignon? It's great you're cooking at home because going out to eat (which would probably be an expensive restaurant for you) is costly too, but maybe you don't have to do fancy every night? I don't know.  Savings is good! But... Even if you're not TTC, building up your savings is necessary for everyone in case of emergencies. It's recommended to have 6 months (which is tough to do) of savings in case you or your spouse lose their job, have a medical emergency, etc. Getting a part-time job on the weekends or at night would be great for making extra cash, but keep in mind to toll it will take on you. I could imagine that running a daycare is exhausting enough. Would you be able to take on that second job? Getting enough rest is important for TTC, and once you get pregnant, that could be a LOT to deal with as pregnancy is exhausting as well. How much could you save if you cut back on alcohol, weed, and expensive dinners? Are there any other adjustments you can make (e.g., subscriptions, buying in bulk, etc.) to save more money?  You and your partner are a TEAM! He needs to help. You said that your partner still wants to try this month. That's good! But he needs to realize that if he has specific concerns about being ""100% ready"" that he does indeed have the power to help change that. It is not just you, and it can't all be on your shoulders. He doesn't need to exactly ""lead the charge"", but both of you can sit down and agree to make positive changes and adjustments for both of you. It's a team effort. If you feel like all of the pressure is on you, communicate that to him. He may not even realize it.    Anyways, I hope this helps! Beginning TTC can be stressful and overwhelming, but you'll be fine!"
TryingForABaby,3dag8n,jacobbaby,0,Tue Jul 14 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I think his concerns are completely valid and I agree with them wholeheartedly.    In terms of drinking we tend to share a 6 pack of craft beers a night + split something else like a bud light lemonade-rita. The drinking is what concerns me the most. I'm honestly a little scared to completely stop once I am pregnant and I think that's making me want to drink more right now. In any case I really do want to cut back a lot, even if we're not TTC, but that has been an ongoing battle for months that neither of us has completely committed to. Weed is a different beast ha we both have anxiety problems and weed helps out with that a lot. We have been cutting back and we've been successful, but I feel we're still spending too much money on it. We definitely do not plan on stopping once we have a kid because we don't think it's a bad thing and it has improved our quality of life by a lot.  Our meals are expensive because we make EVERYTHING from scratch. The problem isn't necessarily that we're buying steak every night, it's that every meal has a million ingredients. So now we're just trying to have one big meal a week and then eat just simple healthy dinners the rest of the week and I can have leftovers of the big meal for lunch.  I'm not to worried about another job exhausting me. I've been wanting another one for a while but I didn't have a car, but I just bought a new car not too long ago. I've been going a little crazy actually due to the fact I feel like I'm not busy enough!  He's bad at talking, and I probably talk too much. Last night I did tell him that I feel like this is right, I know it's what we both want, and I want to commit to it, which means really being serious about all the issues he addressed. He just said okay and that was the end of the conversation. I knooooow his communication issues are an ongoing problem we have to tackle, and he's been doing awesome for the most part, really, but I get SO disappointed when he shuts down when we're talking about baby stuff.    Thank you for the response! I'm just brooding and it's naptime at work so I just have sleeping babies around me to remind me of all the babies I want lol"
TryingForABaby,3dag8n,oh-no-varies,6,Tue Jul 14 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much that you like to cook expensive meals, and it is true you may not be able to work a second job if you have a challenging pregnancy (I know someone who recently missed 4 weeks of work in their first trimester due to severe morning sickness) we cannot predict the kind of pregnancy we are going to have-- you may have an easy pregnancy and feel up to working more, but you shouldn't plan on being able to work more because it is equally possible that you won't be able to. None of us can know that in advance.   I would be more concerned about the drinking, particularly if the idea of cutting back or stopping once pregnant is causing you anxiety. I would suggest that perhaps you find a good counsellor or therapist to talk to who can help you manage the anxiety and can help you make the healthiest decisions for you and a potential baby. I see a counsellor and it is immensely helpful with my anxiety.   With regards to the weed, you may want to consider cutting down (both of you) as weed has really really poor effects on fertility, particularly for men. You may find yourselves taking a long time to get pregnant due to that, just something to consider.   I know it isn't what you probably want to hear, but if your partner thinks you guys aren't quite ready yet then you might want to seriously consider taking a break for now. Counselling might help you to come to these decisions together as a team, and might help you figure out how to make the healthiest decision for you and any potential baby.   I understand baby fever, believe me! For us, we knew in our hearts weren't ready quite yet a few years back when I had crazy baby fever, and I waited and brooded and cried sometimes, but I knew the best decision for this human being I was thinking of making was if we waited to resolve a few outstanding issues we felt should be taken care of before trying (financial situation etc).    The best thing you can do for your future child is to do your best to realistically assess your situation and decide if you are giving that potential child the best possible chance right now. If not, maybe focusing on having a family (not just a baby, they aren't babies for long!) will be the motivation you need to make some healthy adjustments.   I find it helpful to make these decisions by removing the idea of a cute little baby from the decision and instead imagining my 6 year old or 12 year old. What effect would these decisions have on this child that talks back to me, has tantrums, needs swim lessons, gets chicken pox, gets bullied or bullies others. There are a lot of financial and emotional factors we all need to be prepared for when we decide to purposely take on parenting. It's easy to get distracted by the baby lust, and imagining a child instead of a baby sometimes helps put these things in perspective."

More importantly, though, you are describing a lot of things that would make your doctor worry, like drinking 3+ beers/night and smoking weed often enough that you recognize it's an issue both financially and for your own mental/physical health.  Honestly, I would strongly recommend you go and talk to your doctor about these things as they are red flags for your own health.  Alcohol withdrawal is THE MOST DANGEROUS of withdrawals and I strongly urge you not to attempt to do it without at least talking to a medical professional.  Please please please go see a doctor."

Thank you for your concern, but I am definitely not near that level of dependency on alcohol.  I have quit drinking cold for stretches of time previously, just never really stuck to it. It is a mental dependancy, not a physical one. And in the case of weed, I actually do not think it has a negative effect on my health at all, actually quite the opposite. That being said, it is still VERY expensive at ~$80 a week."
TryingForABaby,3dag8n,jacobbaby,3,Wed Jul 15 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, I agree with what everyone else has written in terms of starting to make some lifestyle changes, so I won't repeat what they've already said. Regarding TTC specifically, you could take the time off that you need to make some changes, but continue tracking your cycle (ie. temping, OPKing, checking CM ... all that good stuff!) so that by the time you do start TTC for real, you'll have a month or more of data, will have a better idea of your cycle length, when you ovulate, etc. It might help you feel like you're doing something towards TTC despite not actually TTC.  Also, if you're not taking a prenatal multivitamin containing folate, you'd ideally start taking that now. I wish you all the luck in this! No one said this journey was easy, but I have full confidence in you!  Edit: Just re-read the other responses and wanted to add that I think (vague memory here) alcohol and/or weed can decrease male fertility by affecting sperm counts/motility/morphology (though it is reversible once the drugs are stopped), so that would be another reason to cut down/out the alcohol/weed."

TryingForABaby,3dag8n,janajinx,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"First of all, THANK YOU. I am so very grateful for your responses and it definitely helped.   Yesterday my partner and I talked more, and we have made some decisions. We are going to enjoy this weekend since today is our anniversary and tomorrow is my birthday, plus his mother is coming into town today (joy! ðŸ˜§). We are going to make some changes after Saturday, starting with our alcohol consumption. Last night we drank significantly less than we usually do and all was pretty good. I did have some slight anxiety when I tried to fall asleep, but I think that had more to do with the fact that I didn't smoke last night either. I'm not as scared about all of that now that I feel my partner is ready to make those changes with me. That is definitely a good feeling!   All I can say is that this whole experience is making me fall more in love with him everyday. In the past we've had problems with communication and shut downs/outbursts and it's amazing to see us trying so very incredibly hard to make this baby a reality. We have decided to continue trying, although I'm pretty sure this cycle won't produce anything of value due to the fertility issues of smoking weed. I'm excited to just enjoy this cycle and not stress so much though. I'm going to continue tracking my stuff, although I realized this morning that my basal thermometer does ZERO of the features it claims, so gotta get a new one of those. And prenatal vitamins as well!  Again, thank you. Your responses really did help and make me think, and many of them brought tears to my eyes."

A number of pregnancy related sites that many newbies (myself included) visit like 'the bump' and 'baby center' will tell you over half of couples trying to conceive will fall pregnant within three months. I even took my 'majority of couples conceive within three months' directly from baby center!   Its a very common statement. The reason I said it was to address how I haven't fallen into that bracket like many people thought I would (looking at you mum!)

I was told I was likely ovulating while I was ON the pill and taking it correctly leading up to me coming off it (I'd been on it 16 years).

There is one thought I find comforting when I encounter psycopaths.  They don't feel empathy or fear, and many think themselves superior and are happy about that. But...the only true emotion they have is anger. Smugnes is not an emotion. They are not truly happy. Ever. They are missing out on love and happiness.  Granted - they don't know that they're missing out on. But I know. I know that they live half lives. No...not even half.   They might find some fleeting, morbid joy in being horrible to others or ""winning"" at something. The flipside of that need to ""win"" and to be superior, is a constant feeling that they aren't getting ""what they deserve"". They don't always win. And they will never, ever be satisfied. Jealousy and anger is the result, because only people able to feel happiness can ever be content.   They are wolves in every way.

Plenty of people continue running, hiking, swimming, etc. during pregnancy because they did it before they got pregnant (but, obviously running it by their OB before continuing that regimen).  When TTC, I can't imagine that a doctor would tell a woman to stop climbing stairs!

After 6 months of trying, I decided to switch to something less intense (barre classes), and my period has come back a lot stronger. I also started to get better CM. However, after two months, I am still getting BFN. However, TONS of amazing women do cross-fit and have no trouble TTC. So at the end of the day I don't know if I made the right choice. I really miss cross-fit, although I am still feeling strong from barre classes (and have a bit more energy). I guess just listen to your body and do what feels right."

TryingForABaby,3d6wdc,snuglasfur,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:50 2015 UTC,I only used it externally and got my BFP this cycle. Never used the applicator.

TryingForABaby,3d6wdc,UnicornToots,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:55 2015 UTC,We just use it externally so no applicators. We miscarried that baby but I don't believe the hype that it causes less viable sperm to reach the egg. It's just lube not a fertility miracle. We use it to make sex more comfortable so I'd recommend using it however you feel is most comfortable. I imagine that stopping to use some applicator would kill the mood.

We used pre-seed for the first time on the 13th cycle using the applicator and I got a bfp! I don't know if it was a coincidence or the pre-seed that did it, but if/when we're ready to try for #2, we'll use pre-seed from the get-go.   I don't know how much of a difference using the applicator vs. not using the applicator would make, but my gut instinct says not much. Likes someone has already said, it just makes the lube more thoroughly coat the vaginal canal."
TryingForABaby,3d6wdc,themildones,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:58 2015 UTC,I would use the applicator and go way up there because I figured if it's laying on my cervix it will help the semen swim around. Also I had to hide the fact that I used it from husband. He hates lube.
TryingForABaby,3d6wdc,jwad1246,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:41 2015 UTC,I have heard a little about this preseed lube and i am wondering what the actually success rate of this lube is.
