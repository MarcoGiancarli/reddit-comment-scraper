aww,3c7tjy,behaliel,I think some people have posted pictures from the late 1800's of people dressing up cats and taking their picture.
aww,3c7tjy,Elementium,"Complete with little captions, lolcats-style. The one I keep thinking of is a kitten in a highchair with the caption, ""What's delaying my supper?""\n\nAnd old-times people thought that shit was hilarious."

aww,3c7tjy,shannondoah,Reposted in r/oldschoolcool
aww,3c7tjy,Darkless69,That cat has been dead since before any of us were even alive. It was dead before our grandparents were born.
aww,3c7tjy,Priority-Commenter,"Some grandparents...my grandmother was born in 1897. \n\nNot that it really matters, both the cat and her are still dead now anyway."
aww,3c7tjy,Zubo13,um rude you're ruining my moment of bliss right now so rude wow\n\n[7.5]
aww,3c7tjy,unforgivablecursive,HOW DID YOU FIND THIS?
aww,3c7tjy,shannondoah,"You know the guy that thought of it was super excited to set it up and take the picture, too, but I bet everyone he described it to thought he was insane."
aww,3c7tjy,scottmill,People have been drawing cats since at least the dawn of Ancient Egypt.
aww,3c7tjy,shwag945,"Hell they made their fertility goddess a cat, maybe a bit too much into it. Then again, their goddess of destruction was a cat too, maybe they knew what they were dealing with."
aww,3c7tjy,BulletBilll,I think they used to taxidermy cats into positions and make tableaux scenes from them.
aww,3c7tjy,EnIdiot,Pretty sure ancient Egypt started that
aww,3c7tjy,FartsWhenShePees,"Honestly, it was genius of kodak to choose that picture. It's actually pretty shitty, but just caught a cat in one moment. \n\nThe next year, I'm sure people blew a few hundred extra on film just trying to win with a better cat picture."
aww,3c7tjy,TheSkirtStaysOn,Started a loooooong time before that!
aww,3c7tjy,0818,"I have ancient Egyptians on lines 3 through 991. Something about ""Mau"" and kitties being gods."
aww,3c7tjy,atari2600,Awwwww and that Kittie is dead now
aww,3c7tjy,ChrissMari,"It isnt how they died that we shall remember, but how they lived."
aww,3c7tjy,vlasvilneous,It was a cat how do you think it lived
aww,3c7tjy,xWaves_,Purrfectly
aww,3c7tjy,rdubs89,Poor kitty had no money. She was a paw-purr.
aww,3c7tjy,fishsticks40,She had all of the lady's money. She lived like a purrincess.
aww,3c7tjy,Dindu_Muffins,It wasn't enough. She had to take a job earning meow-rly wage.
aww,3c7tjy,fishsticks40,I find this hard to believe. She owned her own company. She was the sole purr-prietor.
aww,3c7tjy,Moose021,"To avoid lawsuits, she turned it into a Limited Liability Corpurration."
aww,3c7tjy,Dindu_Muffins,"I dunno, my cat just had some salmon. So not so bad."
aww,3c7tjy,keanex,Your cat eats better than I do.
aww,3c7tjy,lets_get_hyyerr,"Me too man, me too"
aww,3c7tjy,keanex,"So you eat better than /u/lets_get_hyyerr does, or your cat eats better than you do?"
aww,3c7tjy,ericwdhs,My cat eats better than us both
aww,3c7tjy,keanex,I eat better than I poop.
aww,3c7tjy,DMann420,Glad to see you've mastered the difference between adverbs and conjunctions
aww,3c7tjy,IhateSteveJones,"Hmm, that cat does have a shit eating grin."
aww,3c7tjy,SomeConsumer,I gave my cat real wild-caught tuna yesterday. He vomited it on the carpet. Never again.

aww,3c7tjy,Alan_Smithee_,as is Kodak.
aww,3c7tjy,DpwnShift,"You might be thinking of Polaroid, which is dead.  Kodak is still around and in a lot of different industries.  They've lost their high and mighty place in the camera world but they are still a viable company."
aww,3c7tjy,dancingwithcats,Both are still around in the camera world. 3rd parties pay to use their names!
aww,3c7tjy,luger718,"What is a company, but a name?\n\n/s     well, kind of"
aww,3c7tjy,-wellplayed-,"A miserable little pile of patents, enough talk, have at you!"
aww,3c7tjy,Dexaan,So we can still take a picture of Pitbull in Times Square with a Kodak?
aww,3c7tjy,Psirocking,My glass lenses are Kodak.
aww,3c7tjy,Max_Thunder,"They've lost their high and mighty place in the camera world\n\n\nTrue. But also Qualex, their chemical company and paper and licensing in photo labs, etc. Truly a shadow of what they once were."
aww,3c7tjy,DpwnShift,"No ""sad"" content, \n\n\n\nYou broke the rules! I'm telling."
aww,3c7tjy,Jungian_Ecology,What is dead may never die
aww,3c7tjy,Scottydontno,Thanks buzz kill
aww,3c7tjy,mastersw999,It's name was Robert Paulson.
aww,3c7tjy,Jerry_the_Cruncher,The best thing about Reddit is I knew this comment was here even before I found it.
aww,3c7tjy,ilsotus,"That's how I feel everytime I watch old movies, I spend half the time wondering who in the cast is still alive."
aww,3c7tjy,PanSexualMicrowave,But it will live on forever in the Kodak hall of fame.
aww,3c7tjy,threestardot,Too real!
aww,3c7tjy,scrubius,One of its seven lives died
aww,3c7tjy,coolmtl,So is grandma
aww,3c7tjy,daimposter,That made me laugh harder than I should have
aww,3c7tjy,Miles0smiles,"you ruined my joke.. i came here to say ""that cat was dead long before the photo was taken"""
aww,3c7tjy,toiletennisracket,That kitty's name? Albert Einstein.
aww,3c7tjy,ilovelsdsowhat,Well that escalated quickly.
aww,3c7tjy,RainySkies88,"True\n\nBut still, that cat could have still been alive when Clinton was president. Or run over by a car 3 years later."
aww,3c7tjy,steavoh,Getting karma was tough back then.
aww,3c7tjy,Michael_J_Fart,"Was the caption ""Say cheese""?"
aww,3c7tjy,Jsdo1980,say cheese so the mouse comes then the cat smile
aww,3c7tjy,cdl_--,"I remember seeing that photo published. Could not say where, maybe in the special section of the Sunday paper? But I remember it."
aww,3c7tjy,judiwth,This is the best photo ever taken with a Kodak camera. The best.\n\nedit: I just want to emphasize yet again that I have never ever seen a photo this perfect taken with a Kodak camera. When I saw this thread I was assuming it had to be a fake. Naturally. But it really checked out. This photo - deservedly so - won one of the highly coveted Kodak awards. I didn't think I would ever see something like this in my life. It's kind of like Woodstock just better.
aww,3c7tjy,putabirdonthings,That is a great photo.
aww,3c7tjy,1893Chicago,When someone tells me I'm pretty.
aww,3c7tjy,pfftiful,So tell us: what happened to the cat? Good kitty? Did he/she live a long life?
aww,3c7tjy,valleyvictorian,Now she also won getting to the front page on reddit. Yay for granny
aww,3c7tjy,Kingbasquiat,"That is like the beginning of Cat pictures on the front page, and all over the internet."
aww,3c7tjy,Xameless,Cheesin!
aww,3c7tjy,we_wants_the_redhead,What did she win ?
aww,3c7tjy,Nymik,"An instant camera, it was their polaroid rip-off, but it was recalled years later after they got sued."
aww,3c7tjy,pilsung,"For $915 Million. It was tough. Kodak never recovered. Most of my family used to work there, most of it is gone now."
aww,3c7tjy,notfin,Well that sucks. Do you own a polaroid now?
aww,3c7tjy,Blipblipblipblipskip,My uncle worked at Kodak for years. He eventually got laid off. Then he died.
aww,3c7tjy,MisterVega,Wow I didn’t realize Kodak literally fired people.
aww,3c7tjy,Michmatch,The original Cat Memer. Your Grandma is a legend.

aww,3c7tjy,scrubius,Cats.
aww,3c7tjy,DogFashion,Pictures of animals who have since passed away always make me sad. Unless kitty is alive and well and 42 years old. That'd be great.

aww,3c7tjy,MitchNYM,It's sad to think that kitten has been dead for over 25 years.
aww,3c7tjy,squitzeaux,"Your grandmother was ahead of her time, taking pictures of cats in the 70's. Hahahah"
aww,3c7tjy,trickman01,I bet your grandma never though that that little contest winner would be shared with millions of people across the world.
aww,3c7tjy,RaCailum,That cat is taking a second grade yearbook photo.
aww,3c7tjy,Psychoprozac,Sounds like your grandmother belonged here.
aww,3c7tjy,aerosmithguy151,Your grandmother must have smiled always at that cat since they can learn behavior and I will be damned if that cat is not smiling!
aww,3c7tjy,BoxOfBlades,Cats broke the internet before the internet was even INVENTED! mind blown.
aww,3c7tjy,kevmacgov512,Cats are a timeless karma mine.
aww,3c7tjy,9gcc,Times were simple then
aww,3c7tjy,woozy99,Was it the only entry?
aww,3c7tjy,BlayneTX,"Let them downvote you to hell, you have one believer. \n\nThe level of photography in Kodak contests in the 70's was very high, and the photographers had actual skill, since there was no Photoshop. \n\nIt's hard for me to imagine that this photo won anything.  However, speaking the truth is some kind of a warm-fuzzy violation"
aww,3c7tjy,svenniola,OP's Grandma is full of shit.

Dont be a victim.\nEDIT:To all the people saying i'm a bad dad, there were plenty of happy times before I crushed his fragile little neck. When I would watch tv on the couch he would be waddles down on the ground and then make his way up my leg and then my body and then plop his little duck bottom right on the top of my head and watch tv with me.

aww,3c99af,theacorneater,I've owned a few ducks and to be honest they're as low maintenance as pets come. Just make sure to get a pair so they have company. Bring them into a caged area at night so they aren't eaten by foxes/coyotes and yeah that's about it.\n\nPut out a container of water big enough for them to get in. It will vary from breed to breed and even from duck to duck how much time they spend in the water but they do like cleaning themselves.\n\nYou can get special duck food but they'll also eat bugs and what not out of your back yard to supplement their diet.

aww,3c8ii0,monkeybugs,"Heat waves are pretty tough on pregnant cats.  If the heat gets high enough, the kittens will have birth defects.\n\nI live in Yuma, Arizona and I've seen it happen.  One of the family pets is a weird little calico with about half a tail.  We think she was born some time in July five years ago.  \n\nWe're lucky to have a veterinarian as a family friend.  She lives a few houses away from my parents and the calico regularly visits her.  She doesn't think the cat's tail was amputated, and that it's a birth defect.  I did a little research and found out that tails and legs are sometimes deformed when the mother is exposed to high heat.\n\nFurther, the calico's coat is weird.  Pretty normal up front, but about halfway back, it gets stiff, like a dog's hair.  Very odd, and not like any cat I've seen in my 42 years.\n\nThe calico was in pretty bad shape when I found her in the alley.  Along with the weird tail, she was nothing but skin and bones.  She was losing hair from malnutrition, had a few infections and had to have a few infected teeth pulled.\n\nNow, there is a happy ending.  The calico is ridiculously friendly and let me pet and pick her up about a minute after I found her.  I brought her inside and gave her all the food and water she wanted.  That went over pretty well, and she moved right in and slept on my bed every night.  My parents fell hard for her and guilted me into giving her to them.\n\nThey're retired and they baby her.  She visits most of the neighbors and get loads of attention and treats.  Everyone loves her.  Including the veterinarian, so she gets handled by a vet almost every day.  She's very healthy and if she ever needed anything, the vet would treat her ASAP.  Not a bad ending for a little alley cat.\n\nSince she moved in with my parents, I've adopted a big gray tabby girl and three black cats.  All wonderful pets and I still see the calico when I visit home 5-6 times a year.  She clings to me and drools for an hour when I show up."

aww,3c7e6s,Radoasted,"Hey everyone!  Sister here again. :)  I've LOVING all the compliments!!!  Many of you have asked for the recipes and they definitely are no secret.  Someone even posted both cookie recipe and the icing recipe but I don't use the icing recipe they posted.\nHere's the cookie recipe:\nhttp://www.sweetsugarbelle.com/2011/06/basic-sugar-cookie-recipe-2/\nRemember, using powdered sugar instead of granulated reduces the  spread of the cookie and eliminating all baking powder/soda also reduces spreading so you have a much flatter area to work with when decorating.  Also, baking them fast and hot reduces spreading as well.\nHere's the icing recipe I use:\nhttp://sweetopia.net/2012/01/royal-icing-recipe-free-illustrated-recipe/\nI don't make any changes to that one.  It's awesome!!!"

aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"No, that's my neighbors sons name.  No judging...."
aww,3c7e6s,Lockraemono,"Thanks for linking the recipes! I have never made cookies like this before, so incoming noob question: how do you get the icing to be so flat and pretty? Have you ever done a video of you simply putting down the icing? I can't picture how this works."
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"I have never done a video myself because there's so many videos out there already.  Seriously, that's how I learned.  Just go to youtube and search for royal icing basics.  You can learn in about half an hour!"
aww,3c7e6s,Lockraemono,"I definitely will, this looks too fun!"
aww,3c7e6s,starrynyght,How do you get the icing to be so uniform like that? The icing is so perfect that they look fake!
aww,3c7e6s,Moar_Cuddles_Please,"The cookie is outlined using a thicker consistency icing first, then ""flooded"" with an icing of the same color but with a thinner consistency to obtain the flat, smooth icing finish. \n\nThat certainly doesn't explain her infinite patience or amazing artistic skills though."
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"The CORRECT way of doing that is exactly how you said.  Thicker consistency for the border, thinner consistency inside....HOWEVER, I'm actually way too lazy for that and I use the same consistency for it all.  They only time I use a thicker consistency is when I need the frosting to hold shape.  That's hardly ever though..."
aww,3c7e6s,nickynips,How do you fill in the middles using the same consistency and still get that flat look? It doesn't look like you pipe in the middles so I am curious how you achieve this with 1 consistency
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"I pipe in the middle.  I use 10 second icing for all of it.  I don't pipe all the way to the edge of the cookie, so I don't need build that wall with thicker icing like you would if you did go all the way to the edge."
aww,3c7e6s,nickynips,"So you outline first, then pipe in the middle with the same icing? It's amazing how flat it comes out, I thought you'd be able to see the piping lines. Great job"

aww,3c7e6s,son-of-a-mother,"Beautiful! I'm inspired -- I want to start baking. \n\nAre you an artist? Do I need to have artistic talent in order to get such perfect images on the cookies, or are there tips and tricks that you can share?"
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"I am most definitely not an artist.  I can't even draw stick people.  I do some of the more detailed work viz wax paper transfer.  I'll print the image on my computer and then put a piece of wax paper on top and make the image.  Example: Cubs cookie and Perry the Platypus.\nOnce the image is dried, I just peal it off, and set it on top of a freshly iced cookie.  It looks great!"
aww,3c7e6s,son-of-a-mother,The fact that you're not an artist makes the cookies even more amazing. I'm definitely going to try this! Thank you!!

aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"I have!!  I've made vegan cookies, and then gluten free/dairy free for my nephews.  I just googled a recipe and made sure to eliminate any baking powder/baking soda because those cause spreading and I want to make sure I have a flat surface for decorating.

aww,3c7e6s,PixiePurple87,She's really great! Be sure to cross post to /r/cookiedecorating
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"Aaand subbed!  I'm a huge SweetAmbs video fan, now a whole sub?  Awesome."
aww,3c7e6s,Jenicsaco,"If it's not a secret recipe or anything, could you ask her for her icing recipe? I make really good sugar cookies, and I love baking. My dream is to one day open up a cupcake/cookie shop, but I can't for the life of me get a good icing recipe for cookies that will set properly/quick enough that it doesn't just turn into a giant blob of colour! Her cookies are the best I've ever seen!"
aww,3c7e6s,moogooguydan,"Actually the recipe I use is this one:\nhttp://sweetopia.net/2012/01/royal-icing-recipe-free-illustrated-recipe/\nThe hardest part is getting the consistency down...once you master that, it's a piece of cake!"
aww,3c7e6s,Jenicsaco,"My first reaction, ""Some people need to be pushed off a cliff. It isn't fair to be able to do something so perfectly.""\nSeriously though, these are so darn incredible! How she does this ""for fun"", and isn't rolling in cash from a crazy successful cookie business is beyond me."
aww,3c7e6s,BoopsDoodles,"Most people don't want to pay several dollars per cookie which is the only way this can be even a little profitable.  There is so much time and effort involved in making cookies this nice.  My SO and I make cookies about half as professional as these and people always tell her to quit work and school (pharmacy) and open a bakery. It takes 2 days worth of work (including drying time) just to make 50-100 cookies and it's hard to ask much more than a dollar per cookie. \n\nPeople that do this do it because they like doing it, not because it's a lucrative business."
aww,3c7e6s,n0saj,"That's totally fair! I hadn't considered the creation time..Eesh. That's some impressive patience! \nI wish I had that kind of skill, too. :)"
aww,3c7e6s,catsandblankets,Mind sharing the recipe for the icing?
aww,3c7e6s,GingerAloeCactus,do all the cookies taste the same??
aww,3c7e6s,moogooguydan,"Yes, it's just a sugar cookie recipe and icing w/ food coloring"
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"Are her recipes a secret?\n\nI tried to do this recently and firstly, couldn't get the cookies to hold their shape through multiple attempts (yes I tried adding flour, people) and my frosting kept being too melty to hold specific shape too. Sad face."
aww,3c7e6s,ROUS_Do_Exist,"It's not a secret no, but I know it's taken about 300 attempts to really master it. They are so delicious though, seriously!"
aww,3c7e6s,andjew,Have you tried coating the outside with a wash of egg? That's how I get my hamentaschens to hold their triangle shape.
aww,3c7e6s,Mitoni,Try putting them in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes after cutting them out.  Do you use butter or margarine?  When my SO and I make cookies we put each batch of dough into a gallon ziplock bag and flatten it as much as possible with a rolling pin then put them in the fridge until we are ready to bake.  They will be too firm to roll right out of the fridge but will soften enough after 10-15 minutes.  Invest in some rolling pin spacers (shouldn't be more than 10 bucks) because if your cookies are different thicknesses they will all bake differently.\n\nMake sure you are using a recipe for rolled out and cut sugar cookies.  The dough should be very stiff.
aww,3c7e6s,Limberine,"He is right, that answer is yes...except for picture #2.  Those are vegan and tastes...vegan.  :)"
aww,3c7e6s,reddithatesmee,She sure has young friends - most are between 2 and 12 years old! :)
aww,3c7e6s,reddithatesmee,she should open a shop. seriously.
aww,3c7e6s,Slothkitty,"She already has so much going for her. Two kids, and a wedding videographer business. I agree though, I could sell the crap out of these cookies, but it's genuinely just for fun for her!"
aww,3c7e6s,krymsontied,Most that enjoy baking can't stand it once it turns into an on demand thing for business. It takes a certain type of folk to do that day in day out.
aww,3c7e6s,KyleGrave,"I would say the most that would happen is a website and the sell is the intimate nature of the buying experience. Take any franchise or pop culture icon and have a discussion about what would translate well into a cookie. Wondering how it tastes? We'll mail you 6 frosted cookies for X amount towards your future purchase. All we need is a perfected shipping method, a gorgous website, and through the buying experience the realization that these cookies are special; then even $10 a cookie doesn't seem so bad. Plus, remember this is all for fun and no one wants to get crazy here, we all have things going on. I'm looking at it more from the angle of monetizing her hobby, so she can earn some extra cash, but still have fun with it. She does NOT need or want the pressures of all of that."
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"Does she have any youtube videos on how to ice like that? If not, she should totally make one....or more. Those are awesome. Mine turn out looking totally rubbish compared to hers, and I thought mine were ok....until I saw hers."
aww,3c7e6s,JamesGravy,"This would be an excellent idea for her since she is so busy with her kids and business. Opening a store is A LOT of work, but her YouTube videos would blow up u/radoasted"
aww,3c7e6s,SuchCoolBrandon,"Actually, I should teach her Vine and she can do some Time Lapse videos, right? The world has enough How-To's, right?"
aww,3c7e6s,nurb101,"It would be cool but I'm sure most people want to see how she actually frosts them! You could probably skip the baking part though. Tons of moms would love a DIY for their kids birthdays! I'm sure most of his is sheer talent but she could do different videos for different designs and characters, for sure."
aww,3c7e6s,SlippingAbout,It just takes patience and a steady hand. She showed me some techniques that are quite simple that help\n a ton!
aww,3c7e6s,kairisheartless,"Yes, especially the frosting part"
aww,3c7e6s,Rae_Starr,The spelling of those names are atrocious.
aww,3c7e6s,princessbrybry,"No, I don't want a ninja turtle party, I want a Donatello party!"
aww,3c7e6s,RangerBob19,I was reluctant to include that one just because it bothered me so much that she didn't go all the way and include all of them!
aww,3c7e6s,marnie3353,I did what was ordered.... ;)
aww,3c7e6s,Drawtaru,I wish I had friends.
aww,3c7e6s,CookiesByIngrid,"Happy 444th birthday, Rebekah!"
aww,3c7e6s,Drawtaru,Her friends need to stop thinking they're clever with the way they spell their kids' names.  \n\nAll they're doing is forcing their kids to grow up having to spell their name everywhere they give it.

aww,3c7e6s,KevWill,"http://sweetopia.net/2012/01/royal-icing-recipe-free-illustrated-recipe/\n\nMake a big batch and then separate, thin, color, and bag it.  I swear, sometimes the prep work takes longer than the actual decorating."

aww,3c7gon,summiter,That paint job along your baseboard trim is top notch.
aww,3c7gon,cbCode,"Thanks for pointing that out, in a way I ended up enjoying that more than the cat."
aww,3c7gon,TheAmiableMedic,"I imagine to get it so perfect they removed the baseboards, and painted them separately."
aww,3c7gon,akua420,"Or, ya know, masking tape."
aww,3c7gon,retrogreq,"There are a few problems with masking tape.   One, even the best kind can leach paint underneath, or warp if you live in a humid place.   Two, it is difficult and extremely time consuming to put it on exactly straight, I used to work for a painting company during the summers of university and after many summers of doing it I still had a hard time getting it perfectly straight.  And three, last of all, it sometimes will pull the paint off when you remove it, which is a giant pain in the ass.  \n\nI just assumed, since the baseboards are also brilliantly white and not scuffed, that it was painted while the walls were painted, and to do that they are removed. It's actually quite easy, and much faster than taping."
aww,3c7gon,akua420,"Zoom in on the picture, and look on the bottom left part of the baseboard, I would put money on them using masking tape.\n\nAlso, if you worked for a painting company, didn't you use dehumidifiers whenever painting indoors?"

aww,3c82b2,mas_tequila,That's awesome! I've only seen 3 wild foxes for a total of 2 seconds during my entire life. Elusive little things!
aww,3c82b2,mwho,Which one liked hugs the most
aww,3c82b2,Mike_Facking_Jones,I ended up just getting mine from the auction house.
aww,3c82b2,babywhiz,Was the assembly difficult?
aww,3c82b2,CigarGuitar,So what do they say?
aww,3c82b2,mfnjc,What do the foxes say?!! \n\nYou know what no.. Just no.. I am so sorry.
aww,3c82b2,jams354,Boooo!!!
aww,3c82b2,desenagrator,this is totally photo-shopped.  Seriously you need to get out more
aww,3c7o90,rvtjess,Frenchies can't swim that's why he is terrified of the water!
aww,3c7o90,norrischrism,"His owner wants him to know how to escape the pool so if he ever fell in he would know how to get out. We would carry him to the middle and he would frantically swim to a wall and we'd divert him to the stairs. He figured it out pretty quickly, but he would try to hide behind the flowers around the perimeter of the pool... which was kind of moot because his shark fin was always giving his location away, haha."
aww,3c7o90,norrischrism,He is a handsome fellow for sure :) that shark fin looks good on him! I need one for my two!
aww,3c7o90,Li_3303,I've done this with all my dogs.
aww,3c7o90,bannana,"If he falls in the pool he without the float vest he will more than likely drown, frenchies and bulldogs are too heavy to swim properly. They usually die in water where they cannot stand."
aww,3c7o90,fleetofrobots,This. Even pitbulls are so dense it's hard to keep their heads above water. Mine loves to swim but only where she can touch the ground.
aww,3c7o90,emmaleth,"Regardless, it's smarter to teach him where the steps are so he has some chance at getting out of the pool than no chance at all. Plus, their pool is completely gated so there is no access unless you open the gate and let them in. The owner is a vet and I'm an RVT.\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter either way, though, as he refuses to go anywhere near the pool, lol."
aww,3c7o90,bannana,"Yes, they can. I don't know why the urban legend that French bulldogs, English bulldogs, pit bulls, etc. are too dense to swim is so popular."
aww,3c7o90,emmaleth,"the urban legend that French bulldogs, English bulldogs, pit bulls, etc. are too dense to swim is so popular.\n\n\nI know why, because every single one of these sites say so: \n\nhttp://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/adoption-info/health-safety-your-frenchie/frenchie-heat-safety/\n\nhttp://www.petmd.com/blogs/fullyvetted/2006/july/poolside-safety-prevent-pet-drowning-deaths-6591\n\nhttp://abrifrenchbulldogs.com/Information.html\n\nhttp://www.cesarsway.com/dog-behavior/basics/10-Interesting-Facts-About-Bulldogs\n\nhttp://redwhiteandbulldogs.com/english-bulldog-fact-fiction/\n\nhttp://www.rarebulldogs.com/health.htm"
aww,3c7o90,HighUnicorn,"The first one says ""few Frenchies can swim."" The second gives advice for all dogs, even the supposed swimming breeds. The forth points out that they have a higher risk of drowning because they're brachycephalic. The airway issue is still a problem even with a life vest and has nothing to do with density like others in this thread claim. Bottom line is that some bulldogs can swim, but should be watched just like other breeds.\n\nThe comment I replied to, ""Frenchies can't swim"" was an awfully broad statement. Any breed has individuals that can swim and some that can't."
