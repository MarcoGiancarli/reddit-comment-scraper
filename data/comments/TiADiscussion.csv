Not even for ideological reasons, despite my reputation this sub. From an objective perspective, it's poorly argued and poorly constructed. You attempt to tackle a bunch of different issues in each paragraph instead of exploring or properly explaining one idea at a time. Each paragraph should deal with one or two concepts, and explaining your justification and arguments about that concepts. Leaping from idea to idea without explaining your argument isn't effective. Each idea should logically transition into the next.  You just kind of throw out ideas and move on. Your thesis argues that we need egalitarianism, not feminism, but then you don't mention what egalitarianism is or why we need it. You don't touch on the ""roles set by nature"" that feminism challenges. You don't really explain how the percentages of stay at home parents have anything to do with the idea of male privilege. What does your mother's poster have to do with otherkin? What is the connection between feminism and otherkin? Why do you take an entire paragraph to describe you CSI-ing a video to track a woman from a video that has been deleted? And how is that video representative of the many complex ideas about what feminism is?"

TiADiscussion,3e4h7u,poobah34,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with his assessment. The thesis should be the main overarching point that your paper attempts to prove. Each paragraph should develop a sub point for that thesis and should focus on a single idea and lead into the idea developed by the next paragraph.   Also, some general tips on style, try to avoid using references to other parts of your paper such as using the word ""this"" to reference a quote. Using ""this"" a lot gets boring, instead try to come up with some sort of more interesting noun to describe what you are referencing. ""Is"" and other forms of ""to be"" are also boring, try to come up with verbs that express more meaning.  It's not always easy to use these tips but they are certainly worthwhile to practice and use in your papers. Anyway, I'm not an English teacher, so I'll just shut up now. Good luck! :)"

Ultimately such a project is doomed to fail. How do we decide that someone is man/woman as opposed to male/female. Male/female are biological terms and you determine who is what simply by lifting a skirt(or measuring hormones or some other empirical method).  But we determine who is man or woman by their behaviour, their atributes or actions. This is why it is so easy for 3rd wave feminists to call it social construct.  My point is, even if we would lose our bodies and would try not to ""socialize"" gender behaviour, people would still have consciousness and free will, therefore would still differ with actions and opinions and some of those would bear resemblance to what we now call man/woman dichotomy."

It's an interesting question I've talked about with an SJW friend of mine. Her belief goes beyond respecting the particular unique pronouns of each person. She believes that our society should stop using gendered pronouns altogether. Instead of assigning male/female at birth, let the child grow up and decide to call themselves whatever they wish. When they do grow up, instead of assuming he/she, we ask them what their pronouns are.  Men's and women's sections would no longer be needed in stores. Instead, they will be replaced by the ""People"" section, where people look for whatever they need without the bias of gender. The two examples she mentioned were tampons and male/female deodorant. What is so special about deodorant that it discriminates based on sex/gender (interchangeable here)? And since not all tampon users are female, cisnormativity would also be addressed with this new store organization.  In the same discussion, we were talking about racial segregation. So this ends with ""Instead of living according to some arbitrary societal gender roles, or experiencing biases due to race, we can start looking at the only race that matters: the human race."" How profound.  TL;DR - Anything designated for male/female/man/woman would basically smear together to become ""For people."""

Believe me, she thought this through. I asked her what her ideal world would be and a world without gender differences was her first answer.  EDIT: I told her that the men's and women's sections are there for easy organization, but she said it's still segregation.

She specifically wants people to no longer feel ""othered"" for not fitting into a gender binary.

In children, the desire to be of the other gender must be present and verbalized. This condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.    and   It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.   The blanket statement that gender dysphoria is not a disorder is just wrong. It plainly is, it's just that not all transgender people are experiencing gender dysphoria, the key requirement being impairment of function and distress, which I would argue is quite common given the social stigma associated with transgender individuals."

People are so quick to find examples that basically just rhyme with whatever they are trying to do. If you put a gay person in a room with no external influence, they can pretty much just be gay and be fine with it. It's society and the rest of it that creates problems, from what I've seen. Someone with gender dysphoria can't just stand in the room, it seems like whatever they have puts them in a state of crisis that needs to be addressed.A visceral discomfort or state of being that can't be left alone. Currently the only way to address it is surgery and cosmetic stuff, as opposed to a pill that makes the person comfortable with their sex. It seems like an illness where the only cure is transition.  On the other hand, I've talked to some trans people and given them that choice: if you were able to get surgery to transition to the different gender, or take a pill that made you comfortable and at-ease with your current gender, which one would you take? A surprising amount said the surgery rather than the pill, meaning there's some other cultural or identity shit going on, like they have the ""soul"" of the opposite gender in them that can't be addressed psychologically."

TiADiscussion,3dxkcq,Wylanderuk,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah they have a target lock, but people with other mental illnesses have target locks. A depressed person may have a target lock of suicide and a schizophrenic could have a host of other target locks. Being unhappy with your current state doesn't mean you actually understand what it means to be in the state you desire. A man with gender dysphoria does not actually understand what it means to be a woman - he will not go through many of the important milestones many women go through in their lives, as well - all he has is the understanding that something is ""wrong.""   And this is aside from the other transgender people who seem to believe that liking things of the other gender makes them that gender. For example, boys who like dolls and dresses. I don't believe this actually makes someone transgender, so this is strictly reserved for the biological and medical state of gender dysphoria.   So if they spent their life being unhappy with their current state and yet have no real concept of what it is to fully transition yet, the pill would cure that unhappiness. It would make that crisis-state and discomfort go away. It would address the issue. Unless you are arguing, as I pointed out above, that there is some inherited or constructed idea of what the other gender is and they identify with that, like they believe they have the soul of that gender inside of them."

Theoretically, it would be possible to treat being transgender like any other mental illness but for several reasons (ethical, practical and so on) we can't.  Does this mean that you should just throw everyone who identify as transgender into therapy and think that it would solve everything? No, just like you wouldn't treat someone with chronical depression with solely therapy.

A lot more expensive than cochlear. Implants.   Get off this The SurgeryTM fixation. That does cost a lot, but there are many cheaper ways to help alleviate gender dysphoria. The cheapest and easiest thing is calling people by the right name and with the right pronouns. That costs you nothing, but makes them feel a lot better. There are also hormones that cost about as much as insulin for diabetes. While that adds up over a lifetime, it's actually much less expensive than anti-depressants or anti-psychotics for depression or schizophrenia.

If the suicide, substance abuse, depression and overall rates of mental illness and other issues among trans people are anything to go by one could easily make the argument that they're actually a lot more impaired than people that grow up deaf.   It's interesting because the trans movement borrowed the concept of the social theory of disability whole cloth from the disability rights movement. The idea that disability is not a personal issue but a societal one; that it's not created by physical impairment but by lack of access and the presence of barriers. In the same manner, I've seen it argued that gender identity disorders are simply a result of lack of social acceptance and access to resources.    Get off this The SurgeryTM fixation.

Gender dysphoria is a disorder according to the DSM (the DSM doesn't use the word mental illness, but if you insist on using that word instead of disorder...). It's an important distinction because transgender is something you are, dysphoria is a hopefully temporary condition you have. The APA is quite careful to point this out.   You and others are quite assertive when it comes to this but you're not at all precise or careful about it. That makes you wrong. That makes it clear that you have more learning to do before you act like you're an expert. It's also the difference between being offensive about it or not.   I've also seen it mentioned that external factors often contribute heavily to the distress of being transgender, which is true. That does not fall under the category of gender dysphoria automatically. Being estranged from your family, losing a relationship, or losing a job can be stressful. Distress associated with those things fall under generalized anxiety disorder. A trans person who is happy with their body after transition, but is still underemployed and struggling with money would have generalized anxiety disorder if the distress is strong and consistent enough.   So, please, can we say that there are disorders often associated with being transgender, not that being trans is, itself, a disorder?

A mental disorder indicates a statistical medical abnormality which causes any degree of distress or complications. A mental illness is on a completely different level.  But that's not what bothers me. What bothers me is the rabid insistence on calling the entire thing a mental illness. It's frankly insulting and belittling. It's especially bad when people use it as a justification for being accepting of transgender people. ""Oh, they're only slightly mad as a hatter, so we should simply accept that because it has basis in medicine. Also they need treatment"".

Don't tell me that the fact I can't walk the street without being constantly stressfully hyper aware that people probably don't see me as the gender I wish to present is normal, because it boosts my anxiety through the roof and makes me sob myself to sleep. I don't think there's a better word to describe that than having a disorder/mental illness, bruh  The fact that people do see it as a disorder is, in my opinion (and opinion of many others, from what I've heard), beneficial. Doctors and psychologists are bound to help us because our condition is medical. For example, I don't have to pay for my surgery, because I am not getting it for shits and giggles or to feel pretty, but because it will greatly improve my mental state.   transgenderism is a ""mental illness but trust me I'm all right with trans people"".

TiADiscussion,3dxkcq,bergini,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"ITT: Everybody misunderstanding one, gigantic, important thing.  The distinction the APA has made with the change from Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoric Disorder. They went away from diagnosing the identity(i.e. being transgender) and moved to diagnosing the discomfort by living as the gender assigned with an individuals birth sex(i.e. Dysphoria).  The problem with claiming ""transgenderism"" is an illness is multifaceted. First of all, it's a complete disregard of the APA model. Secondly, it makes the claim that even after treatment these individuals are still mentally ill. That does not make sense. If you have an individual who is depressed, and meets all the criteria, and they take SSRI's along with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and at a later date no longer meet the diagnostic criteria you wouldn't continue to call them depressed or mentally ill. Hence, if we treat gender dysphoia through transition and trans individuals no longer qualify for the disorder you can't just blanket label them mentally ill.  The other main issue at hand is that, often, calling ""transgenderism"" a mental disorder is often ""concern trolling"" or a way to disregard or look down upon those who are transgender. It can often look like, ""These people are obviously mentally ill and we must deny them the treatment they want, and that the APA has agreed upon as the best course of action, because it disrupts how I personally think of society. For their own good, of course. Can't allow these good people to hurt themselves.""  So basically stop being lazy and calling ""being transgender"" a mental illness. Instead make the distinction and say ""Gender Dysphoria is a mental illness,"" otherwise you're lumping yourself together with people who are actually transphobic and are intending something entirely different with their words."

I guess logic would lead me to the conclusion that amputating the limb of someone with Body Integrity Disorder would remove their mental disorder but would physically handicap them, exchanging a mental health issue for a physical health issue. Not that the mental/physical symptoms are necessarily equivalent, but I don't think you see this kind of trade off in someone who suffers from Gender Dysphoric Disorder or at the very least it's narrowed to potential issues with hormones or surgical complications."

Frankly, as a Jew, whom everyone knows is a Jew, has Jewish family, has known various Jewish people and has some understanding of how Jewish communities feel, I think any suggestion of them being institutionally disadvantaged or oppressed for being Jewish in America today is utter nonsense. Antisemitism exists. It usually comes from backwards idiots and it usually manifests in messages online that only serve to expose and belittle the poster. But if I had to accept a power + prejudice justification for the word there's no way I could agree it exists.

TiADiscussion,3dyzef,EmptyEmptyInsides,3,Mon Jul 20 21:20:22 2015 UTC,The fact he got elected twice pretty much shows it had little affect...the one thing that happened that I would have thought would have had a negative impact was being awarded the noble peace prize for some speeches.
TiADiscussion,3dyzef,JaronK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:54 2015 UTC,We have no way of knowing the effect.  It may simply be that an unpopular outgoing president and an uncharismatic opponent in round two gave him enough of a bump to survive despite the racism angle.  And there was definitely a racism angle... but it may not have reverberated as much as it would have a decade earlier.

Meanwhile regular fans decide to piss off and the constant money stream dries up and then publishers bitch about the death of the medium, never seeing that it's kinda their fault.  If you want to see a current comic series that actually has great female characters try the Injustice series.

That isn't to say there wasn't some odd ones. Some TiA odd, some odd odd. Several had ""do not contact if you do not understand consent"" I have to wonder how one who does not understand consent would understand that they also are being told not to contact someone. One hit about every tumblr stereotype. The person was using some of those tumblr pronouns, asexual, rainbow hair, if I remember they had a list of phobias, liked discussing every social issue. Funniest part is she checked me out and apparently found me uninteresting, guess we felt the same about each other.  Feminist ones aside was one girl seemed nice in every way, but she listed she loves Jesus about 6-8 times through a moderately sized profile. I wish her the best, but I she would probably not be entirely happy with an atheists nor and atheist with her.

TiADiscussion,3dzw5b,Danktron,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, if you say ""I'm not a feminist"" to most educated women, you may just as well have said ""I'm a misogynist"", which, of course, is a deal breaker in any hookup or relationship and rightfully so. Most educated women go by the dictionary definition of feminism, which is simply equality. So if you aren't a feminist by that definition, then you are indeed a misogynist. What they don't understand is SJWs have so corrupted the modern feminist movement that many people who are indeed feminists by the real definition don't identify as such, because they don't want to get lumped in with the crazy SJWs.   In the future though, if any woman asks you if you're a feminist, say yes. Most women aren't the SJW kind of ""feminist"", but they will not tolerate people who think they are inferior and rightfully so."

If look it up in the dictionary, all it means is advocating for equality between men and women. By that definition, everybody should be a feminist.  The feminist movement, however, has a specific set of goals. The people in the movement use the word synonymously with their twisted version of ""equality"", turn most men off from the word, and then complain about why more men aren't calling themselves ""feminists"". They only have themselves to blame for that. But you're unusual among women I know; most of them insist on being called feminists but are in fact egalitarian (or feminist in the equity sense of Sommers); with a lot of women they get taught the dictionary definition (from history lessons) but don't join the movement because they got better things to do. But they don't abandon the word, because they were never treated badly by ""feminists"" unlike most men I know, and don't realize how depraved the SJWs are in co-opting the word."

No. There is absolutely nothing everyone is supposed to be. I do not like feminism, partly because of this attitude of ""but feminism is The Equality"". You realize that advocating for something doesn't mean they actually do it well or that they do it in a way that I (or anyone else) can agree in for sure, right? PETA advocates for animal rights. On paper it sounds awesome. Until they start kidnapping pets, advocating for putting them down, for not testing on animals even when it is for important medication that can save millions of people, taking away and killing all support animals, etc. I'm not sure how long we can keep repeating No true Scotsman. University feminists are protesting against Sommers, she's basically excommunicated. We can say the bad ones are a vocal minority, but they achieve things. They get support. They inserted themselves into academia, media, they do the researches on rape/domestic violence/gender relations/etc. They are the ones terrorizing people, pushing for absolute bullshit rape laws, getting people fired, getting products changed. Really freaking active minority. Feminism is not my chosen, beloved thing. If it can't show me a face that will make me feel inclined to take the name and join, then it is their fault.

That's a problem with the movement. They think they're the only ones that are worthy and righteous, and everyone else are misogynists who ""don't understand feminism"". Special snowflakes indeed. Feminists, in history, didn't always agree. They argued a lot. But they didn't shame each other as misogynists, like they do now.

So, I draw a distinction between a ""feminist, of the traditional sort, who lives in the modern day"", and ""modern feminists"", which are a new breed.

TiADiscussion,3dyaz4,young_fella,6,Mon Jul 20 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you in sentiment, I think it's important to note that as humans, we do sometimes have to acknowledge and support other people's feelings even when they might lack normative justifications for them, and even if we personally disagree. It is true that, in itself, feelings ""prove nothing about the act being bad or good,"" but since feelings are an inevitable part of the way we parse decisions (they are how we sort through mental clutter), interpreting all feelings as nothing more than aesthetic preferences (like which foods or music we enjoy) is a little dismissive. Things that affectively please people go in one pile, things that they're disinterested towards in another, and things with negative affect in a third. And we do this pre-cognitively.  So saying ""The fact that Sadness is represented as chubby makes me feel bad"" is an implicit expression of a normative principle: that we should not associate negative affect with chubby-ness, especially in children's cartoons.  You are free to disagree with that justification or the principle it espouses, but to paint it like it doesn't exist or like we should de facto assume leftists express feelings merely to shut down a conversation is disingenuous.   I also think it's important to distinguish people who merely feel that a certain thing is problematic and those who go the next step into trying to convince others that they, too, should be offended. Not every disagreement over whether something is good or bad entails a political contest, and this goes for both people like you and SJW's. Just like you should not pretend that your annoyance towards SJWs who express feelings is bias-free or obviously true; there are good arguments on both sides. The problem is when we paint weird, untrue Manichean dichotomies that end the conversation before it begins. It even becomes impossible to agree to disagree when people can't decide what we're agreeing to disagree about."

The point is just that justifications for general principles come in different forms, and it's dishonest to say that affect isn't one of them. To just say ""your feelings don't count"" all the time is dumb because people aren't just saying ""this is my feeling"".  The way people feel should be a part of the consideration on social issues because humans often make decisions in certain areas (but not others) based on the way they feel about the options, not as rational actors. Think about religion: atheists and religious people are fundamentally speaking different languages (they evaluate the justifications for and against religion differently), and nobody cares because they're all having too much fun pretending the other Just Doesn't Get It. That is why feelings matter.  Stop pretending we're all the fucking Nietzschean Ubermensch who can logic away everything."

TiADiscussion,3dwtlm,ThisWaterIsCold,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"Because the average black person in America (or African American if you prefer) has 29% European ancestry:  http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2013/02/how_mixed_are_african_americans.2.html  And until very recently miscegenation was very stigmatized in America. There's no good way to put this, but this suggests that much of the European ancestry in black Americans today comes from the slave owners who raped and impregnated their black slaves.  Allegedly only 1.4% of white Americans owned slaves at the height of slavery (http://www.vice.com/read/hey-v12n5) - I'm not sure if this number is reliable, but when you consider how many (predominantly white, or at least non-black) people immigrated to America after slavery was outlawed there's little chance that the amount of slave owner ancestry would be comparable.  The fact that slave owners raped their slaves and even enslaved their own children only adds to how utterly abhorrent the institution was. Which should be a part of how anyone reacts to this. But it's also an object lesson on how judging a person on ancestry alone is completely inappropriate."
TiADiscussion,3dwtlm,EmptyEmptyInsides,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense.   I don't think this is a good argument for why white people shouldn't have to feel bad about slavery. It isn't like black people whose ancestors were conceived of master-slave rape (which is most of us) benefited from the institution of slavery. I feel like  at any point before 1970 or so, white people benefited from not being black. Even today there is a pretty strong case to be made that because of the way black people were historically treated in America,  you are better off being white. I think that is what white people who bitch and moan about being made to feel  bad about slavery are missing. It isn't about ""your ancestors owned mine so you are (likely) better off"" so much as ""my ancestors were owned so I am (likely) worse off""."

But I don't think it's fair (or productive) to place a specific burden on white people to feel bad or guilty over slavery. All people should feel bad about racism in America and support a less racist society. Understanding the context and origin of racism (in the case of racism towards black people in America, slavery is the most dominant factor by far) is vital for understanding racism in America, and for example the context in why so many black people are so much worse off.

Not everyone who is transsexual will transition but many do. It's become a politically incorrect term over time though, probably because it has ""sex"" in it. I prefer it because it is specific and accurate to my situation.  Transgender is an umbrella term that covers anyone who is gender non-conforming in some way. This includes transsexuals, cross-dressers, genderfluid, etc. Lately it's become the politically correct way to refer to transsexuals and most of the time it's used that's what people actually mean.

I'm trans as well and would not say it is similar. I've never really longed for my missing limb or felt like my body was wrong because of it. Being trans to me is more ""something that should be there isn't, and the thing I have instead is wrong"", phantom limb is more ""something that used to be there is gone"".  EDIT: I should add that born amputees do get something called phantom pain often, because of malformed nerve endings.

TiADiscussion,3dw8at,tetsugakusei,3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"I'm fascinated by how the western narrative of trans is not universal. The western narrative takes the issue of trans very seriously (and indeed why not). So that to be trans is extraordinary bad fortune and that the people who suffer ""by being born in the wrong body"" (as the narrative coheres) cannot be dismissed as faddish or (and this tends to be the greater criticism) as fetish. This narrative, however, is greatly undermined by the looser reality in non-western countries of trans individuals.   In my last job, around 10-15% of my students were trans. They were typically the prettiest girls in the room. But their behaviour tended to have an ironic twist. Sometimes, for example, they would lift their skirts to show their underwear to their classmates. In other words, they didn't quite believe it themselves. Of course, the counter-argument is to make the Hegelian point that to be a woman requires recognition of the other.   One of my students took me by surprise when, as she put it, she was 'man-hunting' during the lunch break. She told me that she became a girl because she could ""get more guys"". She said her heart was a man's. This is obviously a rejection of an ontological trans position. It has a double-impact since people judging trans will be more accommodating the more beautiful the transgirl is (this is, of course, wrong, but it is the way of the world).   Knowing all this, and the way they clearly undermine the western narrative of ""I'm a woman born in the wrong body"", to what extent are you prepared to moderate. mediate, away from the po-faced current narrative. I note a deep conservatism in the trans position: a desire to be mainstreamed and for gender to remain a clear cut divide. And this conservatism shows up its more unpleasant side by the trans demonification of men who like trans as 'tranny chasers'.   If you accept my claim that the western position of Truth on this issue is simply a currently dominant truth (with a small 't') then the issue broadens.  You obviously could not suffer from gender disjunction if you were the only person on earth. It must be the product of the valences of the dialectical relations with others. So the western narrative (""I'm trapped in a man's body"") despite being contingent has had a huge effect on your life. I'm intrigued how you balance the historical contingency of your condition and the nature of your identity.   EDIT I note that I've been downvoted. This is in line with expectations. The dominant narrative will always punish awareness of its contingency. Part of the western narrative is to claim a universalism. Indeed, it can only live with this condition.  I should point out that I am deeply in favour of queer rights and strongly campaigned for them."
TiADiscussion,3dw8at,nomalaise,2,Mon Jul 20 09:32:17 2015 UTC,You obviously could not suffer from gender disjunction if you were the only person on earth.   That's not as obvious as you claim.
TiADiscussion,3dw8at,inyouraeroplane,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:50 2015 UTC,You could have no concept of another gender if you had never come across any person of the other gender. This is drawn out in a sub-narrative by trans that they watched a TV documentary on trans and realised that was them. Identity is socially formed.
TiADiscussion,3dw8at,gleepeyebiter,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"But, at least for some, transgenderism is more than just that. It's the feeling of being the wrong sex. Sex isn't socially formed. It's biological. So it is possible a person could find their body feeling wrong without seeing anyone of the opposite sex.  In this case, the documentary thing would be simply putting a name to a problem they had already had. Not exactly an uncommon occurrence in life."
TiADiscussion,3dw8at,tetsugakusei,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"It's the feeling of being the wrong sex   Feelings don't simply float around as ether. They appear with 'intentionality'. They are attached to something. I appreciate the sub-narrative is ""I just feel something is wrong', but this simply begs the question, as we are pre-supposing a foundational ""I"".   The OP was clear with her ""I"": ""I'm a Trans Woman"". The empty 'I' is immediately asserted. You should be immediately on guard: what on earth does this sentence mean. It is up there with ""I am a diligent person who always tries to be kind to others"". The very moment she makes that claim in her head it is busily undermined. Note this literally happens in this AMA. The OP promises to ""answer(ing) any questions you may have"". And yet she noticeably does not answer mine. Mine requires her to drop the ego. She is required to ruminate.   This is not some great insight or revelation, we all have this experience of emptiness of the ""I"". David Hume famously dismisses the persistent ""I"", Hegel would not know what you meant, Lacan would laugh.   I can't help but(*) notice, it is only in countries with high levels of narcissism that the most popular psychoanalysts are the 'Ego psychology' type. I wonder where the OP comes from. She is manufactured in her culture. Her false being is enough to prime her to open up an AMA.   Of course, and this is key, I don't care what you think. My interest was to see the strategies and ploys she uses to defend this ""I"". Note, I am greatly sympathetic-- no, I am more than that, I am entirely with her-- but I am interested in the darker depths of the topic, not the banality of 'when did you feel you were a woman?'. I understand that to open herself up on this point undermines the dominant narrative that has slowly spread in western culture, but I don't think opening up on a reddit AMA will do her any harm. Just go for it Ms OP.   (*) The Lacanians among you will enjoy my use of the infamous ""but""  in this sentence of the anti-Cartesian ""I""."

That's very implausible, but maybe true. Them lifting their skirts to show off their genitals to everyone? Yeah, no. That didn't happen. Pretty much anyone with even minimal amounts of social competence knows you don't go showing your genitals (even clothed) to strangers, especially not if you're trans because a lot of idiots are out there who will hurt you if they find out.  What also absolutely did not happen was someone telling you they transitioned only to pick up more men. It is way harder to find a partner who will remain interested in you once they know you're trans than to just be a gay man. Nobody transitions for that reason without some other problem underlying it. If someone did the ""I'll become a girl so I can find more guys"", but wasn't actually gender dysphoric, they'd end up developing gender dysphoria since their body wouldn't match their mind and people wouldn't treat them like the gender they see themselves as.   Imagine if you woke up tomorrow with a vagina and everyone treated you as a woman named Heather and if you told them that's not your name they'd think you were crazy and needed mental help. That's what someone with gender dysphoria goes through all the time. It's not ""Hmm, I bet I could pull more guys as a girl"" or ""I wonder what this would be like. Better go through a bunch of therapy, socially uproot myself, and pay a lot of money out of pocket for medical treatment to find out."""

I know anything that is binary is considered horrible and oppressive, but fuck it. You are not asexual if you do feel sexual attraction with conditions. It reminds me of a girl I knew who said she's basically vegetarian, but she eats chicken and fish. Honey, you're not a vegetarian then. Edit: Another thing is... to me it  sounds like these things kinda give proof and ammo to people who say asexuality is not real, just picky girls do it, who will suddenly change their mind the moment they get properly fucked by the right person.

The people rejecting that set of ideas realized that they needed to name it in order to define it and point out why it was wrong.   Do SJW's inadvertently believe in Social Darwinism?    No. Modern sociology of race seeks to explain race (how racial divides formed, how one group gained power, how this power manifests itself) without resorting to biological superiority arguments.    If being white or male is always a position of superiority in need of social correction for the sake of ""equality"", is that an unspoken admission that minority groups and women might be inferior or incapable of ever holding that same position?

They don't believe it's inherent that whites and males have positions of superiority, they believe it's more or less arbitrary. If you really press them on it they won't get into detail about how that might have originated though. They don't really think about it, especially not about race.  There are some SJWs who think that male superiority basically originated because of the greater strength factor and then it grew from there. But as far as they're concerned the superiority is arbitrary beyond that and they believe it's long due for change. Since certain patterns in society are so resistant to change they are increasingly more convinced that they are extremely hard to change despite being arbitrary in origin.  For example, SJWs might complain about the fact that most CEOs are white males (even over the proportion of the population) but they will chalk up the white part to initial white domination over other races centuries ago. They won't really further question why whites dominated over other races centuries ago instead of the other way around.  And they will chalk up the male part to initial male domination over women some hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years ago. And they will explain that using physical differences. They won't really ever get to psychological differences between men and women."

TiADiscussion,3drgay,transitivecurves,34,Sat Jul 18 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a racism binary where you're either racist or you aren't. It comes in degrees. Having a black friend at the very least says something about you not being at the extremes of racism towards black people, but doesn't mean you have zero racism.  ""Having a friend"" is itself not a binary either. Maybe that person you call a friend gets something from your acquaintance but otherwise just tolerates your bullshit. That could mean you're at least not so insufferable in your racism that no one of that race could possibly want to be around you. But let's say this person vouches for you, says something along the lines of ""I'm a black person who has experienced a fair amount of racism in my life, and my friend isn't a racist. If he were I wouldn't be his friend."" That means a lot more than just simply saying you have a black friend.  There was something like this one that SadPuppies guy where he was called a racist and responded showing he married a black woman and had a child with her. He got accused of using the black friend defense and using his wife as a shield. But in his actual defense message his argument that his wife knew racism and would have kicked him out on his ass years ago if he were one. In other words, he trusts and values her judgement on this more than someone like Arthur Chu, and for good reason."

I also find ""I have a gay/trans friend!"" annoying, because the shit those people tend to say when that friend is not around is still terrible. In general, the reason it doesn't ""count"" is because it's not a relevant or valid counterargument against someone who has just called you out on saying something racist/homophobic/transphobic."

If yes, then his relationship with Pat is irrelevant.  It's not irrelevant in the sense that Bob is hateful of all black people, because technically, he isn't. It's irrelevant because people put greater emphasis on judging a whole group of people over treating someone as the exception.  Also, I think Bob likes Pat because Bob himself values something about Pat that puts Pat above his skin color. Because he doesn't know anything about a random black person, the only thing he could judge them on is their skin color.

It is possible he/she is an immigrant (say Indian or Chinese) and this therefore very insecure about acceptance in a white group. They may keep quiet about things that offend them simply because they don't want to lose favor with the group.

Anyone remember the ""environmentalists"" that were featured on Penn & Teller: Bullshit signing petitions to ban dihydrogen monoxide? None of those people were able to answer basic questions about climate change, pollution, regulations... they simply used ""saving the planet"" as cover for a collectivist agenda.

TiADiscussion,3drepz,dovercliff,8,Sat Jul 18 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"My view on this is simple. If you're a private individual, wandering around and having fun and what have you, then no, there's no onus on you to explain yourself or educate others. Just like when we're over on TiA - we're not, despite what some people think, engaged in a great crusade against the ""SJWs""; we're having a laugh (this can vary over the course of a discussion, but our aim isn't to be a serious business subreddit; see Rule 4). But that changes the instant you lay your hand on the mantle of the advocate or the activist - which is what a lot of these social justice people on the internet do. You will see it in the bios of the tumblrites - the words ""activist"" or ""advocate"" - and in their tags, and you'll see it evidenced in their actions, such as when they criticise someone or something for whatever their cause of the day is. Or rather, in the how - their manner is consistently of someone who expects you to agree with the position outlined by them.  And then, in the cases relevant to this discussion, when asked to explain why they hold that view, out comes that line about ""it's not my job to educate you"", as you note above. Well, they're wrong. When they come out and speak as though they're the authority on the topic, it is definitely their job to educate. They want their audience (not just the object of their criticisms, but any outside observer) to respect and agree with the position they hold, and often do so without either explaining it adequately, or outlining the reasoning that led them to that point; this is, frankly, bullshit. They present the conclusion as a fait accompli, and just expect everyone to nod and agree; depending on the circumstances, they also expect apologies, grovelling, or conversions to the faith.  Yes, I can get the exasperation when explaining the same simple (and, to the explainer, self-evident) thing for the nineteenth time in an hour (I've worked retail; I know exactly what that is like), I can get the desire to not defend your identity and existence from the unwashed masses (I've grown up gay in a conservative area); but when a person takes on the role of the advocate, they lose the right to go ""piss off, I don't have to explain anything to you."" An advocate's, or an activist's, entire function is to convince others of their position, which means explaining the merit of holding it (not just tearing down alternatives); if you won't do that, you're a piss-poor activist. When it comes to the basic things, if a person honestly cares so much about something, and they're doing their ""activism"" online, then they can surely type up an FAQ, or a set of pages with basic concepts outlined (properly referenced, of course), that they can refer people to; the tumblrinas spend so much time on complicated ""About me"" pages with ninety-five gender pronouns, surely they can create one more page outlining the fundamentals of their positions. Anything else is simply lazy; worst-case scenario, they can leave the enquiry for tomorrow. It's not going to grow legs and run away while they go to bed.  To put it simply; if you want the authority of the preacher, you must take on the responsibility of the teacher, or I have no reason to listen to you, let alone respect you or the position you hold. Flippantly throwing out the line ""educate yourself"" is the abrogation of that responsibility. It's also fucking infuriating."
TiADiscussion,3drepz,Sabbath90,5,Sun Jul 19 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree but then again I don't. I think that it's vitally important to be able to argue for things that seem obvious. In fact, I think it's doubly important if it seems obvious because just because it seems obvious to me doesn't mean that I can convey that idea to someone else nor that I've even thought about it.  So I live in Sweden and arguing against the right to marry for homosexuals is sort of the same as stating that the earth is flat. In one way, this is good, it means that we've come to a point were it's simply obvious that everyone should have equal right. On the other hand, it's bad because what happens when someone who've never argued for gay marriage in their entire life meets someone who argues against it? They're going to get bulldozered and look a fool if they're speaking in front of an audience. It's vitally important that we as people should be able to argue for what we believe and give an account for why we believe it and that we teach the next generation the same thing.  This is a thing I see a lot in the left in Sweden, they simply state things like they're obvious and then act like you're an idiot for arguing with them. I'm convinced that this lack of critical discourse is one of the primary reasons why we have a extremely conservative and nationalistic party that got 15% in the last election.

A: Educate yourself. It's not my job to.  I think the tone in which this is uttered conveys not just a frustration with having to expend effort to explain something but a bitterness towards a perceived greater ignorance in society.  If you're tired of being asked questions the easier thing to do would be to not say anything when people ask. Actually, the easiest thing would probably be to not attack them in the first place since it's obvious that it would make them wonder why they're being attacked.  ""It's not my job to educate you"" isn't an excuse, it's a continuation of the criticism. Both towards their target and society at large. Their view is that society needs to change so that people will start to understand how terrible they are. Their contribution to that is not in individually informing others (although sometimes it is) - that would be shifting responsibility to the marginalized party which is its own offence. The contribution is instead in shaming others so their viewpoints become less socially acceptable. If you're being told that you're not going to be educated then chances are that the person sees you individually as a lost cause anyway, at least unless you show enough resolve to heavily challenge your own thinking independently."

From the point of view of making any coherent argument, yes, the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim. But they're not trying to win an argument (at least not so that you personally feel like you've lost an argument), they're trying to shame you and make you feel unwelcome in their space.

For example, if I were to ask ""Why should I identify as a feminist?"" because the answers are so politically and personally motivated, what I Google could sway me away from what whomever I asked intended. Maybe I would find all the good that feminism has done, even in its third wave. But then I might find all the man-hating and counter-racism as well.  If their goal is merely ""This person will be educated by someone other than me,"" then it's goal attained. But if their goal is ""This person will reach the same conclusions and feelings that I have,"" you risk actually pushing them further away.  I'm not saying that I need the person's biases to be influenced ""correctly."" I'll look at all sides regardless and come to my own conclusions.

Because it takes time and research to develop that level of empathy for some outlier group, most people wouldn't bother learning, so you make yourself an even greater outlier by pushing curious people away. That doesn't help anybody... unless your goal in the first place is to keep your circle exclusive."

TiADiscussion,3drepz,Wylanderuk,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:42:25 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between ""I don't need to teach you"" and ""It's not my job"". Someone needing to be taught something doesn't mean that they're entitled to the teacher of their choice.   The fact of the matter is that sometimes it isn't worth people's time Attempting to educate someone can be a frustrating and difficult process. People have lives and needs outside of their identities, and more often than not, that takes priority. Spending an hour teaching someone who disrespects your entire existence isn't something that everyone wants to do all the time. Or trying to teach someone who isn't willing to make the slightest effort to educate themselves with readily available answers before coming to you."

TiADiscussion,3drk0i,Zaiush,13,Sun Jul 19 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"Most people who get upset about non-POC/white people using or giving themselves ethnic names are upset because the names are usually rooted in culture (so cultural appropriation) and those people can give themselves ""ethnic names"" to sound cool while never having to feel what it's like to be teased for your name or forced to change it because no one can pronounce it. There is a trend on tumblr, usually amongst the Asian fandoms (so anime, kpop, jpop, the like) where people will simply ""assign"" themselves Korean or Japanese names that are either completely off base or just totally random, which takes away the value of being given a name by a family member that has a specific meaning (i.e. Korean names traditionally use Chinese characters, which have their own meanings).   The second problem is probably what the POC are more concerned about. That some people will go around telling others to ""use my Korean name~"" when they don't know how it feels to be mocked for your ethnic name, and to have people constantly tell you that you should adopt a Western name to fit in. That those people can just take what they like from a certain culture, but never have to really, truly experience what it is like to be born and raised in that culture, and that they can just drop it whenever they feel like it doesn't suit them anymore.  I don't think it's much of an issue for things like screennames or tumblr urls or anything like that - some people might get annoyed with rp - but the big issue is when someone touts around their ~ethnic name~ like its the latest trend."
TiADiscussion,3drk0i,bingutabi,2,Sun Jul 19 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"Alright that's the view I can understand. Thank you for sharing it.  Now, it is starting to look like they're onto too hard on people who actually don't parade their foreign name/nicknames (and there are a few who didn't reveal their ethnicity either). So, it's looking like they may have their priorities a bit skewed.  I actually don't see too many of these names being callout for actually parading it around/misusing these names/what have you, but rather the reverse. Which, made me start this discussion. Perhaps I'm a bit too optimistic, but I see nothing wrong with liking/wanting names not of your own ethnicity, as long as you did your research behind it and respect the meaning and the culture of that name. That is usually common among most decent artists (majority of whom I follow on tumblr).  Weeaboos on other hand...let's...not get into that.   Everything else though, I finally get thanks to you, and I will encourage to be careful of choosing names from now on. Thank you!  PS. RP is a very grey area regarding names, since you're basically playing as a fictional character and not yourself...but OCs is very iffy...."
TiADiscussion,3drk0i,bingutabi,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure about going around policing everyone who might be using an ethnic name as an alias or nickname, since some of those people may actually be that ethnicity or part of that ethnicity and there's really no way to prove it online. Even if they're not, as long as they have done their research and are respectful of the culture, it should be fine. Using a fictional character's name is fine too, as long as you're not going around telling people you're of that ethnicity when you're not. So imo it's reaching a bit for those ""name police"" to be running around telling artists who have taken on, say, Japanese fictional character nicknames to make it more clear that they draw anime or the like that they're racists and evil and etc, etc.  I'm glad that this makes sense to you!

I think it's kind of important though, and I like discussing the origins of SJW theory because they scare the shit out of me.   Everything established is a tool of oppression to the SJW. I think this is why some people use the term Cultural Marxism. In Marxism everything that exists in society -- government, churches, social organizations -- are a reflection of the class system, and have the function (if not always the intent) of maintaining the status quo of oppression. SJWs often replace the class system with something cultural -- usually white supremacy or patriarchy. They also take most of the nuance of Marxism away -- everything is intentional. Whereas in Marxism some institutions rise naturally from the class system, but aren't purposefully created to oppress because they meet certain spiritual or material needs of people, to SJWs white males created science to oppress. They did this consciously, engineering it to this purpose.   Now SJWs are not Marxists per se -- that would be an insult to Marx (who I am not a fan of in any way -- I take issue with his materialistic philosophical stance, but that's neither here nor there). They not only change the means of oppression from the class system, but they reject all nuance. SJWism is, in my view, a Marxist-inspired form of postmodernism that actually more closely reflects fascism than communist ideology. This is because of its explicit rejection of Enlightenment values. While Marxism saw itself as an evolution of Enlightenment principles arising from fissures in class conflict resulting from economic change (industrialization), SJWs reject Enlightenment thought because it was lead by white males. That ad hominem reason is enough. Logical fallacy? No problem! SJWs reject logic itself, as it's also created by white males. Circular reasoning? Well, we've rejected logic, so it doesn't matter. What does matter? Feelings.   It's important to point out that this line of ""reasoning"" is what the fascists adopted almost exactly. Fascism also had its roots in Marxism, which was then taken and perverted with racism and xenophobia. Mussolini, Robert Michels, Greggor Stasser, Joseph Goebbels -- all these people (and many others) were socialists before turning to fascism.   SJWs and fascists are almost identical from a philosophical standpoint. They difference is the target of xenophobia. Fascism ""punches down"" while SJWism ""punches up.""   This isn't a complete explanation of their ""reasoning."" I didn't go into postmodernism which is a key ingredient."

It is much more attracted to more literary/humanistic types of inquiry. It also tends to take an activist approach, subordinating the project of acquiring knowledge to the project of ""emancipation.""     In the U.S. and most of the English-speaking world, much so-called ""continental"" philosophy, including postmodernism, poststructuralism, critical theory etc.--is viewed (rightly, I would say) with great skepticism by philosophers. Scientists also tend to take a dim view of it. It is popular, however, in those parts of the humanities that tend to be sympathetic toward left-wing politics and activism. Furthermore, the view that inquiry into the truth must be subordinated to politics (aka Lysenkoism) is common among such folk.      Of course there does tend to be a kind of bone-headed reverence for science in the States (and in Reddit...). One can go too far...and this is often called ""scientism."" It's pretty common to hear people say really, really stupid and ignorant things to the effect that straightforwardly empirical science can answer any question, that humanistic inquiry is always nonsense, etc. (Dawkins and NDT are really bad about this.

As for science approaching cold and unfeeling, that can sometimes happen. And we do indeed need to account for societal, economical, and cultural factors when deciding public policies. I see science as being the bottom line in this case, especially for hard sciences. An example would be the massively complex task of creating policies to counteract against global warming. You can't just ask all companies to cease all un-green operations full-stop.  In social and biological sciences, the cold and unfeeling sentiment can come from statistics, which is immensely important for quantification and validation, but is subject to a lot of leeway in interpretation, so subjective input to the result is not completely out of the question.  One important aspect of research that's especially important for soft sciences is that research papers are dialogues, not the final say. When SJWs point out flaws here and there in a paper and discredit the whole thing, they are not necessarily wrong in their criticisms of the flaws, but their mentality is not aligned with the purpose of ongoing research. No single paper, especially in social sciences, is going to give 99% confident and definitive results. The idea behind papers at the frontier of research is to talk to other researchers saying, ""Hey guys, look at this. I found something pretty interesting and you should take a look into this too."" Over time, and possibly tens to hundreds of papers later, academics warm up to the idea and becomes confident in its validity. The response from SJWs is analogous to reading someone's 50-page first draft of a novel, finding a few awkward-sentences and plot holes, then saying, ""Look at this shit! You clearly can't write and you should stop and go kill yourself!"" You can't give them any (merely) suggestive research results because, often, the result is not meant to be final, and because they will be on major defensive mode 100% of the time. And unfortunately, a lot of topics in social sciences remain undefinitive for a long time.  tl;dr Skeptism is good, but only when you can accept ambiguity in the result of ongoing research. SJWs do not do this and are simply on 100% defensive mode."

Of course, rape is vastly underreported, but I find it hard to believe that 20-25% of all women will be the victims of rape or sexual assault through their lifetimes. I guess if you torture the stats, by using the largest number produced for sexual assaults per year (1.3 million or so), convert it into a proportion of the female population, and then doing (1-rate)life expectancy to get the probability over a lifetime, that's where you might get the 20-25% from. Disparities in crime rates, arrest rates, conviction rates, and incarceration rates between races. Mainly, they complain when you point out that black/Hispanic people commit more crime, which is what accounts for a large portion of their higher arrest, conviction, and incarceration rates. To them, if the arrest, conviction, and incarceration rates aren't representative of the population, it must be because the police, judges, and juries are racist, and you're racist for pointing it out, as if you said ""black/Hispanic people are criminals"" as a blanket assertion."

I get aggravated by this as well, because by sweeping the problem under a rug, it doesn't get addressed in the way that would actually solve the problem.

TiADiscussion,3dlb7p,owlowlingson,4,Sun Jul 19 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"It's even better than you think. The documentary had a massive impact in Norway. The research centre that dismisses the suggestion of differences between the male and female brains was actually shut down as a direct consequence of the programme (episode 3 or 4, i think).   The documentary follows the same line each episode. The famous comedian who is the documentary maker first approaches an SJW infested research place, he records them. He then travels to the UK (hugely anti-SJW at its universities, although its media can be pro-SJW) or to the more rational SJW of the USA (e.g. Janet Halley and the North-East feminists etc.) and shows them the recordings, which are then laughed at by the academics. He then records them, takes it back to Norway and shows the stunned Norwegian researchers.   You actually get the feeling that the SJW researchers have never read a literature review in their working lives. It's a similar feeling I get when reading the badsocialscience subreddit. There is a simple point that the Harvard feminist makes about her SJW feminist 'friends'. They tend to be made up of women brought up in ultra-conservative flyover states such as Louisiana, or else ultra-liberals that are so outside the norms of society that they often end up in psychotic states later in life (e.g. Shulamith Firestone). Neither of these archetypes exist in the UK. But a quick flick through the past posts of SJW subreddit members indicates these traits are rampant among reddit's nutty SJWs.  I just wish they would read some books. As a minimum: Kennedy, Bersani, MacKinnon. Halley describes the SJW's posture as 'paranoid structuralism'."

This is particularly interesting in topics where even the relatively mainstream liberal is wrong; just watch the IQ levels programme. Awkwardly, for me and many other liberals, IQ tests are useful, accurate and do what they intend to do, and this means the average IQ of a Kalahari tribesman is not as great as a Korean, and this is not because of the social environment in which they live. When mobs scream down scientists over IQ tests, after the impatient mob has moved on to another topic, a few scientists typically publish articles in defence of the original 'sinner', but their articles are usually unread and forgotten.   *For an extraordinary attack on 'social construction' may I recommend Bruno Latour's book 'Reassembling the Social'. It is particularly ironic since it was because of him that the word came into use. His concern with the phrase is that it implies something is unnatural or wrong or tentative. When, as he strongly argues, 'construction' actually means something is strong, solid, truthful, eternal. Every scientific fact is a construction.

I don't think you're acting so much as a SJW as much as you seem to stand up for them at every turn. It's jarring, given that we're on an anti-SJW subreddit and yet I hear you give justifications for everything they do that you seem to agree with.  And no, I don't say this lightly.

That doesn't mean I support everything that they say or do.   Cultural appropriation is not a SJW concept, it's an anthropological one. It's their approach to the topic and the extent to which they believe in that differentiates them. Someone asked why it was considered bad and I explained to that effect.   ""Educate yourself"" is a fact of the world. No one owes your their time and effort to educate you on a subject just because you ask.   You specifically asked ""Why do people think this way?"". I presented an argument why they might. Don't ask why SJWs think a certain way and then call someone a SJW for explaining their reasoning.   You aren't getting trolled because someone eloquently presents an alternate viewpoint on a discussion sub. It's supposed to be a discussion sub, not a circlejerk. Trying to understand why someone acts a certain way or the beliefs that guide them elevates the conversation and allows for better discussion.

TiADiscussion,3dlm1x,tamaravel,13,Fri Jul 17 07:02:57 2015 UTC,"But what does this mean?   When they say decolonize your mind they're saying you have, due to colonization and what they see to be our racist culture (which is in their mind a consequence of colonization), many subconscious biases, opinions and ideas that are from their perspective racist, classist, or just helping whitey stay at the top, and they're asking you to get rid of them.    what do you guys think of this idea?   Examining the influence that your culture has had on you I'd argue is always a good idea so you don't end up locked in patterns of thinking or behaviour that you go along with because you never questioned them. However as with all things this can be taken too an extreme where instead of just examining the ideas you hold because of cultural influences you just reject them because they have western roots, and ""decolonizing your mind"" as seen on the main sub is often used this way, and in such a case that's just silly.     Is ""decolonisation"", of the mind, especially, really possible?   I don't really think anyone can through simple awareness completely remove the influence of the culture they were raised in on their thought processes, although they, through awareness, can consciously alter their behaviour so that it doesn't reflect these traditions or deeply ingrained patterns of thinking.   I'd also argue that on a collective level if everybody goes about rejecting the cultural influences that surround them then I think social cohesion, people just getting along, would drop noticeably, and if you're doing it and no one else is that'd probably have some negative social consequences."

I would just add that from the academic perspective this figurative colonization is less a ""white"" or ""Western"" invasion, and more of a function of globalisation, i.e. the effect global capitalism has on a given culture.  In America, this gets tricky because really our entire culture is defined by capitalistic pursuits.  Some argue that we become consumers of culture itself, commodifying peoples beliefs, practices and traditions.  Decolonization would be an attempt to get capitalism out of your culture, and to get back to your roots outside of capitalism.    Of course this is all very poorly understood by Internet SJWs, and it has become just another buzzword used to pass judgment on others, especially to feel self-righteous against others who nominally are apart of a minority but still adapt capitalist attitudes and behaviours."

TiADiscussion,3dlm1x,TriangleDimes,2,Sat Jul 18 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"I wrote a long response on this topic in another thread  edit: tl;dr version -- like fascists, SJWs explicitly reject Enlightenment ideas of empiricism and logic. Communists don't.     Okay, reading over this, this got longer than I intended, sorry. I think it's kind of important though, and I like discussing the origins of SJW theory because they scare the shit out of me.  Everything established is a tool of oppression to the SJW. I think this is why some people use the term Cultural Marxism. In Marxism everything that exists in society -- government, churches, social organizations -- are a reflection of the class system, and have the function (if not always the intent) of maintaining the status quo of oppression. SJWs often replace the class system with something cultural -- usually white supremacy or patriarchy. They also take most of the nuance of Marxism away -- everything is intentional. Whereas in Marxism some institutions rise naturally from the class system, but aren't purposefully created to oppress because they meet certain spiritual or material needs of people, to SJWs white males created science to oppress. They did this consciously, engineering it to this purpose.  Now SJWs are not Marxists per se -- that would be an insult to Marx (who I am not a fan of in any way -- I take issue with his materialistic philosophical stance, but that's neither here nor there). They not only change the means of oppression from the class system, but they reject all nuance. SJWism is, in my view, a Marxist-inspired form of postmodernism that actually more closely reflects fascism than communist ideology. This is because of its explicit rejection of Enlightenment values. While Marxism saw itself as an evolution of Enlightenment principles arising from fissures in class conflict resulting from economic change (industrialization), SJWs reject Enlightenment thought because it was lead by white males. That ad hominem reason is enough. Logical fallacy? No problem! SJWs reject logic itself, as it's also created by white males. Circular reasoning? Well, we've rejected logic, so it doesn't matter. What does matter? Feelings.  It's important to point out that this line of ""reasoning"" is what the fascists adopted almost exactly. Fascism also had its roots in Marxism, which was then taken and perverted with racism and xenophobia. Mussolini, Robert Michels, Greggor Stasser, Joseph Goebbels -- all these people (and many others) were socialists before turning to fascism.  SJWs and fascists are almost identical from a philosophical standpoint. They difference is the target of xenophobia. Fascism ""punches down"" while SJWism ""punches up."" This isn't a complete explanation of their ""reasoning."" I didn't go into postmodernism which is a key ingredient."
TiADiscussion,3dlm1x,EggplantWizard5000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think there's a bit of truth to this in that post-modernism and fascism tend to look at modernism skeptically. I would say though that fascism tends to look at premodernism with more affection.  The obsessions of fascists: racial purity,  a warrior spirit, absence of degeneracy, aren't really part of SJW thought.  Anyway I see SJWs as communist+. They are often literal communists, and then apply that notion of class struggle to various other types of ""oppression"". Feminism is emphasized and class struggle de-emphasized but not abandoned. They have some similarities to Fascists and Nazis but this seems to have more to do with horseshoe theory than being influenced by their writings. Most would probably ban Nazi sympathetic writing but consider Marx necessary for a full education. Actually I agree people should read some Marx."

That is, when they say that a respondent is a sexual assault victim, about half of them or so answered no to the sexual assault question but yes to something like the ""unwanted touching question."" That is, they took away the agency of women to decide whether or not they were assaulted or raped and instead made that decision for them based only on how the women answered sometimes vague questions.   Next, you take the response rates you get for rape/assault and multiply by 5 because you only asked about the previous 12 months, multiplying by 5 gets you to 5 years of college. Which is problematic because questions like ""have you been raped in the last 12 months"" are likely to return false positives when you ask that of someone who was raped but it was 15 months ago. A better way to do it would be to poll graduating women and ask them if they were raped during college.   So after multiplying their results by 5 to get to 5 years, THEN they multiply by 10. Why? Because only 1-in-10 rape victims actually report rape. Basically they argue that 9-out-of-10 rape victims will lie on anonymous surveys.  How do they know that? Because they say so.   That gets them to something like 20% of women being raped during college, when the real reported figure is something like .02%. Even if you say that only 1-in-10 actually report rape, that only bumps you to .2%.   So in the conclusions section they address why it might be that their results are 100x higher than other studies and sources. Now I think the reason is that they double the number of rape victims by counting that women who said ""no"" to the rape question but yes to a different one about drunk sex, and take that 2x figures and multiply it by 5x for 5 years and then by 10x to account for women lying about rape even on their anonymous survey. So let's see that's about 2x5x10 = 100x. Seems like that might account for the 100x figure you have compared to other studies.   Nope.  They concluded that their rate is higher because their study uses amazingly worded questions that are better able to illicit ""yes"" answers. How are their questions worded better than others? Well, they often use anatomical terms like ""penis"" and ""vagina"" in the sentence and they claim that using loaded terms like ""insertion of a penis into your vagina"" is more likely to trigger an emotional reaction that results in a higher response rate.   Read some of their questions and you'll see they are not worded great or anything. It's obvious they were just doing anything they could to get as high a figure as possible.   I'd like to do a similar study. I'm going to ask 1000 people if they have been abducted by aliens in the past year. 1 person says yes, but only 1 in 3 alien abudctees will report abductions. So now I'm at 3/1000 or .3%. But that was in just the past year. So I multiply by 70 to account for average life span and now the result is 21% of people will be abducted by aliens."

I like my breasts, and my vagina. They're cool AF. They're useful too.   Due to an endocrine disorder I rarely get periods, my body is kinda male-shaped (shoulders, hips, the works), and I'm rather hairy - I have the beginnings of a mustache and there are like five very thick very resilient strands on my chin. I understand, intellectually, that those things would distress most girls (and they distress many people with my condition). But I've never been bothered by it. I've never, well, felt anything about it really. I refused treatment for my disorder.  I would like a penis. I mean, I'd really really like one. Not only to have sex with, it's sort of just the thing to have, you know? But I don't want just a penis, I want a penis with my vagina and breasts. But it doesn't particularly bother me to the point of dysphoria. It's more of a wistful fantasy, like if Dumbledore showed up and offered to wave his wand and give me a fully-functioning dick I'd accept in a heartbeat but on a daily basis it's kind of meh, though I do catch myself acting...penis-y from time to time. Mostly I don't care what's down there as long as I can get off with it.  Sexual orientation doesn't have much to do with it but I identify as bisexual, though some people would classify me as pansexual or even asexual. The whole mehness about how I perceive my body extends to everyone else I guess, I really don't care if you have a dick or a vag or both or neither and I really don't care what you think about them as long as we're both getting off. Both sets of genitalia (and the attached secondary sexual characteristics) hold no inherent attraction for me. I think it's the act, the concept of fucking itself that's a turn-on.  Finally I identify as a girl mostly because it's what I've always done, it's the body I'm in, the country I live in still sends gay people to prison, and it doesn't really bother me. I don't care how I present; I swing all the way from very feminine to very masculine. Pronouns are a toss-up as well - most people go with she/her but I've gotten quite a few he's and they's that didn't bother me in the least. If I'm presenting/feeling particularly feminine I may point out I'm actually a girl. I detest ze and xir though. Yuck.

It's enough to say that the ""female brain in a male body"" feeling transsexuals report is more than just wishful thinking, but there's still plenty we have yet to understand about how gender identity manifests. If something new emerges that shows it could be possible, I'd accept it.  If I met someone who identified as genderfluid, though, I'd probably guess that there's a high probability that they're trans and repressing it to some degree- people who repress a trans identity often feel like their dysphoria goes ""on and off"" and take advantage of the times it doesn't affect them in order to convince themselves that they don't really have to transition.

It is foreign to my experience. But I have a hard time truly visualizing a billion, and believe in Bill Gates and the Chinese. I consider it possible, and am not going to dismiss it out of hand. Hormones are crazy powerful things, and sharp shifts and drops could leave you feeling some kind of way.   I 100% do dismiss, say, otherkin out of hand. No, you aren't part dragon. But transcats was a fucking rare and beautiful human being. Troubled and sad and sometimes hilarious, but rare and beautiful.   I understand how people can feel profoundly disconnected from society and from the norm. That society and the norm don't offer more to stay ""loyal"" to is more troubling to me than that small groups of  people can't seem to find it, with or without scientific basis. I will respond positively and make reasonable accommodations for that underlying issue, especially since, in the case of gender, it costs me nothing at all to be polite."

TiADiscussion,3djlxe,lifeonthegrid,8,Sat Jul 18 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"(frankly I imagine they would lose their shit at me calling it this despite the fact that gender dysphoria is classed as a mental disorder)   Gender dysphoria is NOT classed as a mental disorder any more. That was removed in the DSMv5. It's the secondary distress (e.g. social backlash from presenting as your identified gender, distress at having your identity invalidated or attacked) due to dysphoria that is a problem; gender dysphoria is explicitly not considered a mental problem in itself.   The amygdala cannot grow and shrink the required amount on a day by day basis. The brain cannot rewire itself overnight to make you feel male or female.   Male and female characteristics lie on bell curves, with no small amount of overlap. There are cis women with beards, and cis men with developed breasts. For genderfluid people, a possible explanation is that they fit in between the two peaks of the curves.   Signs of gender nonconformity in both homosexuals and people who go on to develop gender dysphoria have been widely known to begin showing before they can even talk properly.   Lots of binary trans people don't show signs until later on. Lots of non-binary people do.   I don't think the outward symptoms of fluidity (i.e. sometimes wearing male clothes) are in any way the same as what a person with gender dysphoria goes through.   Genderfluid people suffer from dysphoria. It waxes and wanes, like (nearly) every trans person's dysphoria, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Wearing clothes to affirm your identity is exactly the same behaviour as a binary trans person might perform.   Want to wear trousers today? Wow, looks like you're identifying as male today then! Is that how gender works? Is that really how anyone thinks gender works?   No. This is a total straw man.   Instead, it seems to me that they see transgender people's struggles, and want a slice of the oppression pie, but without any of the actual discrimination, mental anguish or painful, life-altering surgeries and medical treatments.   OK: first, genderfluid people have dysphoria. They have to deal with that, maybe less often than a binary trans person, but no less really. Many pursue medical treatment (hormones) to help alleviate the dysphoria, and have to deal with the medical system, which may not recognise their identity as valid. Also, AFAB people often bind or have top surgery.  Lastly: do you really believe that visibly non-binary people don't suffer discrimination? You're pretty much guaranteed to not pass some of the time. Being visibly trans sucks.    Edit: OK; sorry if this comes off as angry or whatever. I guess it is, but I hope you read it anyway.  One last thing which didn't really fit anywhere, genderfluid people don't identify with their assigned gender, so are non-cis by definition, ergo trans."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,punkbrad7,9,Fri Jul 17 11:36:13 2015 UTC,"I think people who are genderfluid experience dysphoria in a way that resembles the trans experience, but is ultimately different in a noteworthy enough way."

TiADiscussion,3djlxe,sp8der,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:00 2015 UTC,"First, the genders are masculine and feminine (and you could add: androgynous). Second, masculinity and femininity are somewhat similar/analogous to extroversion and introversion.  Third, its the most common thing in the world for people to feel more extroverted sometimes and more introverted at other times. So it shouldn't be any kind of surprise that at least some people can sometimes feel/act more masculine and sometimes more feminine. I, for example, am a dude. I don't consider myself ""gender fluid"" nor any other odd thing. However, I grew up on an isolated , rather bacward farm, where nobody was bending over backwards to play their gender roles. To be honest, the obsession w masculinity and femininity are much more pronounced in cities and in the media.  (Note: this was not some kind of hippie farm. It was just an ordinary farm.). Given my upbringing, I had to learn to act more masculine when I went to school. It's armor against bullies, and its more attractive to the average girl. In private, I'm still a bit more on the feminine side in some respects. I'm kind of emotional and stuff like that.  This is just the way a lot of people are. Masculinity and femininity vary sometimes from minute to minute. It's simply nbd... This is only a puzzle if you mistakenly adopt the SJW/TiA theory about transgender issues. Old-school feminists were right: gender is a pretty unimportant thing, it is only loosely correlated w sex, we should expect it to be really variable, and just generally should stop making such a big deal about it.  The new fashionable theory on the left goes all-out in the wrong direction. Gender is super-important! A man who acts feminine is actually a woman! If you don't have the traditional pairing of sex and gender (Male/masculine, female/feminine) then you have a special brain abnormality that makes you a different kind of person!  This theory even tries to pretend that 'man' and 'woman' are terms for genders, not for sexes...which any competent speaker of English can see is false...and non-competent speakers can easily check the OED... Having a kind of variable gender really only means something like: you have moods. This is not puzzling in the least...except for those who are in the grip of the SJW/TiA confusions about the subject..."

TiADiscussion,3djlxe,implicitself,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:11:31 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you. I've had those misgivings about the whole 'gender-fluid' thing for a while.
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,implicitself,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"people realize that gender isn't real -- to differing extents. some people don't have the wherewithal to escape the social pressure, others adhere because of an insatiable romantic fantasy, some people are just too old to significantly adapt their viewpoints on the matter in any direction. we were raised to see people as gendered: if you have a dick, try to act like a badass. if you don't, try to act like a princess. it's accepted to be as natural to us as are consonants, vowels. it's a cultural institution to caricature our chromosomes for the sake of simplicity, maybe for the sake of sex.   i wouldn't consider myself either ""trans"" or ""genderfluid"", but in a way, i am, insofar as i have shirked my social responsibility to act either hard or soft. in explaining myself and my motives to your typical normal person, who for the sake of argument is completely ignorant to anything they haven't seen on TV, it would be tempting to try to translate it into pseudo-scientific terms like ""bisexual"" or ""bigendered"" or what the hell ever..  aye, it's bad form, logically and otherwise, but how else can gender (and sex, and other psychological processes) be easily communicated? humans don't understand themselves yet, and it will be a little while until they do. it's easy to see the need for these new terms, even if i'd rather just see them all abolished and a culture of actual individualism emerge."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,Mouon,7,Thu Jul 16 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"I'm male but I'm not a particularly manly man. I don't do stereotypically male things. I'm not sure it warrants a phone book of different labels to deal with, though. I understand the importance of breaking down gender roles, but a problem with that is that it's highly unlikely that they are completely socially constructed.   People who are genderfluid claim to move between female and male roles (and dress, etc) on a regular basis, but ultimately, they still adhere to fairly shallow stereotypical behaviour as a means of expressing this, in my opinion."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,implicitself,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"you find it unlikely they are constructed? you believe them to be instinctual, and necessary for proper function?   it's easy to conflate the two -- a persons natural manner and the one they take on while adapting to a situation. in a vast majority of people, the former is completely obscured by the time puberty is over. the latter, that's gender -- it is an anthropomorphic mask for the benefit of others. there are like, a dozen reasons humans simplify themselves into an identity, but that identity is never even close to being the sum of the biological system it attempts to describe."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,Mouon,4,Thu Jul 16 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"people realize that gender isn't real    Thats quite a bold claim. On what basis? Theres a difference between natural behaviour tendencies of people based on whether they are male or female - which is caused by both sex and gender interwoven, and social customs loosely based around it. The problem is, some people don't know the difference and either they try to impose the social customs loosely based around it, or they assume that its all just due to arbitrary social conditioning and that male and female behaviour is just due to social conditioning, as if we are blank slates. Both positions are mistaken."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,implicitself,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"okay, gender is REAL, but it isn't NECESSARY. you don't need to genre-fy yourself in order to live in society, even if it tells you outright that you do. this might indeed be the crux of the matter: that we are doomed to make cultural tools of every kind, and to mimic those who we consider to be most like us, even as many of our cultural tools are based on faulty assumptions and serve only to make us inflexible in our identities, or further someone else's ideology. most people are only equipped to look at human beings at face value; until you understand the nature of humanity, it is all you can do, really. puberty is like a factory, churning out people fresh from their most impressionable years operating under the assumption that if they don't act a certain way, they'll never get laid. it's neurotic, because then we have to dismantle all that stuff to learn how to love other people/ourselves in a healthy way."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,Mouon,3,Fri Jul 17 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"okay, gender is REAL, but it isn't NECESSARY.   Its kind of the result of evolution. Discussing whether its 'necessary' is irrelevant, its real and plays a real role in how we think and how we behave as men and women.    you don't need to genre-fy yourself in order to live in society, even if it tells you outright that you do.    Well the point is most people naturally fit well with gender tendencies, and thus don't need to artificially make themselves conform to gender. Of course there are some social expectations and stereotypes that go too far and exaggerate things, like the overly macho guy who walks with a swagger or barbie doll women who act like they are from Mean Girls. But while they are more noticeable, most people don't actually try to be like those.   that we are doomed to make cultural tools of every kind, and to mimic those who we consider to be most like us, even as many of our cultural tools are based on faulty assumptions and serve only to make us inflexible in our identities, or further someone else's ideology.    Look mostly we just act according to are natural inclinations. I personally am not that masculine, but I'm about masculine enough and I'm definitely not feminine. I mean, I do have a small adams apple and I don't exactly have a square jaw, but I am good looking. I'm nerdy and geeky and introverted, but while I could do with getting more confidence with women, in terms of 'being a man' in the eyes of society, I'm not doing to bad. Its unfortunate for straight guys who are feminine, but its just a fact that women won't find them attractive unless they get in shape to some degree and get more confidence at talking to women, stuff like that. As for gay men who are feminine, they can just be twinks.   most people are only equipped to look at human beings at face value   I'd say many of us can look beyond face value.   puberty is like a factory, churning out people fresh from their most impressionable years operating under the assumption that if they don't act a certain way, they'll never get laid.    Not true. Firstly, the desire to get laid (and 'spread the seed') is written into the psychology of men from evolution. Secondly, while social conditioning is a factor, natural inclinations are more of a factor, and so men since teenage years trying to do certain things to get laid is to a significant degree just boys and men being boys and men. That, and responding to what women are actually interested in from men, which varies.    it's neurotic, because then we have to dismantle all that stuff to learn how to love other people/ourselves in a healthy way.   Are you saying we should try to reprogram our minds and the mins of others so that they stop thinking in terms of gender, because that would be artificial and unhealthy. Expecting people to view people in a not gendered way just isn't plausible."
TiADiscussion,3djlxe,87612446F7,0,Fri Jul 17 10:23:52 2015 UTC,"why isn't it plausible? did you have a point to make about the necessity of gender? why do you personally need it?   if you can claim you don't feel it's influence on you, that's because of course you don't, a human's internal logic is below it's conscious control, and often somewhat beyond introspection unless you're a pretty hardcore meditator. who is born able to identify with any precision what is going on inside them? who is born knowing when not to go along with whatever other people are doing/saying? who can say what drives them to their desires? they can only say what their desires look like, what they feel like. i tend to think that the more specific they are, the more unattainable. unattainable standards of beauty aren't a positive thing. that much is accepted.  how much experience do you have with LGBT people in real life? my argument was always that these people do not need to be labelled ""queer"", not from outside, not from inside. in their personal and professional lives, they are doing the same exact things that their more 'heteronormative' brothers and sisters are doing. loving other human beings. they have preferences, and those preferences are certainly tied up with all manner of nature and nurture. that's fine. but that's all it is, it needs be no more than that. we don't need an extra level of abstraction on top of that for the categorization of people, or love.  it also seemed implausible we'd ever get to see a world where such people are considered full fledged human beings, with every same right and privilege enjoyed by others. one might argue, hey, it's instinctual to be scared of people who are different than you, and so why try to fight it? well, they're probably 99.9998% similar to you no matter how different you try to make them out to be. but people prefer their false dichotomies. they prefer myths to reality. they'd rather politics be right and left, not common sense. man and woman were once considered so different, and this was the engine in the ideology of oppression... that feminism was supposed to address. now we know the differences are far more subtle, mostly manifesting in expression. our motives are identical. one must concede that on some level, our sexual motives are similarly similar.   it follows that gender is one of the reasons sexism continues to thrive. by taking our incompletely understood natural inclinations and codifying them into our culture, we've robbed ourselves of our ability to choose for ourselves the hows and whys of sexual attraction. it becomes a group activity, this creepy ideological obsession, people looking at each other like objects needed to fulfill themselves (sexually or otherwise), even to gratify their own egos. it's so common in this world, i almost consider it self-evident. it's not healthy, but i doubt human beings will always be so naive about themselves, about their psychology.    you might similarly call implausible the acceptance of polyamory, for whatever genetic/social reasons you might cite. but you are capable of reason, no? the tough questions should not daunt you, right? can you tell me why having an open relationship is immoral, and why people believe marriage between man and woman sacred? is it instinct, or is it our inability to imagine a world different than ours without being scared?"

TiADiscussion,3dkqsv,CoMaBlaCK,9,Fri Jul 17 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between cultural exchange/diffusion and cultural appropriation. Cultural exchange is the organic spread you refer to, with people of different cultures interacting. Cultural appropriation is a one-sided transaction and can be done without ever interacting with a minority.   I don't think people are trying to stop the spread of concepts, but rather, it's an issue of giving credit where credit is due. No one is trying to stop people from appreciating Native American designs. They're trying to stop Urban Outfitters from taking designs from specific native cultures, repackaging it as a generic print, and profiting of it.   Not everyone who takes something from another culture gains a better understanding of that thing or that culture. That's one of the primary issues that people take with cultural appropriation, specifically, the adoption of important iconography without showing respect to it.    I also disagree with the idea that cultural appropriation results in less alienation for the culture. Especially since a lot of cultural appropriation is repackaging minority concepts for a white audience, while shunning the originators. Miley Cyrus reinvented herself through twerking and got a ton of credit for it, while the black women who had been twerking for years got glossed over. It also shouldn't be necessary to have a piece of someone else's culture for yourself in order to understand them."

The native headdress is a war icon from a few specific Native tribes, but is adopted by white people as a generic symbol of all things Native. It'd be like a bunch of people in Vietnam wearing Purple Hearts as a fashion statement that represents America. I'm not saying that you personally would be offended by this, but I'm sure you can imagine the reaction.    As for mascots, there are still very real Native Americans alive today in America.

As an American I find little issue with the concept of Vietnamese wearing purple hearts and considering there isn't much major outcry to American flags being burned I doubt there would be any major outcry to a similar situation with any other American symbolism being either vandalized or worn as accessory. It's not hard to come to the conclusion that Native Americans may share the same point of view.  The Native Americans were not treated any differently from any other conquered subject in world history, we don't mourn the colonization and brutalization of the Anatolian Greeks at the hands of the Turks nor we do we weep for the displacement and colonization of Manchuria at the hands of the Chinese throughout the early modern era. There seems to be a profound double standard when it comes to perceptions and treatment of Native Americans, they're humans just like the rest of us and their culture and history should be analyzed with the same fairness we show others."

It is about what the consequence of using another culture is to the people of that culture in a context of power imbalance.   For example, I'm an Indian dude in US. Take Indian culture - it has good parts and bad parts. However, I see in the media, good aspects of Indian culture (such as colorful clothes, tasty food, bollywood music and dance moves) being attached to Western people in movies, TV and music industry. While simultaneously, the bad aspects of Indian culture (sexual repression, socially inept, nerdiness, bad western dressing style) being amplified and attached to Brown people. Potrayals on media have very real and tangible effects on how minority persons are perceived in social circles, professional circles and dating circles.   You have people crediting Elvis Presley with Rock-and-Roll and Miley Cyrus with Twerking, and simultaneously saying 'Black Culture' has contributed nothing to America besides violence and welfare queens. You also have people having terabytes of anime on their computer, or wear Om pendants and have Buddha tatoos while simultaneously saying Asians are good for just winning mathletes and spelling-bees, and don't have any artistic talent. They are ""typical STEM-y"" doctors and engineers, and nothing more.  Here's the thing. We have a lot of Diwali and Bollywood celebrations and welcome white people to wear ethnic clothes and do ethnic dances as a means of respectful participation. However, there are a lot of those rich LA-liberal-hipsters celebrating ""Bollywood themed"" private parties, and simultaneously exclude Indian people from their groups, because apparently Indians are all embarrassing nerds with funny accents.   And its very difficult to call out people on it in real life amongst friends without looking butt-hurt or whiny, because that further adds to the stereotype that Indian dudes are too sentimental or weak, and so no Indian dude will say anything about it."

Or maybe the same thing with a videogame series or an author or something. Different people (usually with more money and power than the original group) come in and change the thing that you liked. They miss the point of what made it valuable in the first place and whitewash it for a mass audience. That's not a perfect analogy but it's the same kind of concept.  To be fair though I think most instances of people complaining about cultural appropriation are bullshit. It's fine if a white person wants to wear a kimono or have cornrows. I get more iffy when it's something like sports teams appropriating native american culture.

To give you a rough idea of where I am politically, the political compass tests usually put me around the center of the green box, with maybe a few lines in more into box 13.    However, the disconnect I feel from internet SJW's comes from their unnatural social evolution that they thrust upon people.    For instance-A new idea emerges, lets say transgender rights.  Of course there are doubters and people generally afraid of change-any person with observation skill knows that being scared of new ideas is a human thing.  If a person merely asks a question that doesn't flow with the narrative, they are shouted down as being full of hate.  I tend to think that ignorance is more or less a product of a poor education system, poverty, and other social ills.  Which is why I also believe that narrowing the income/wealth gap would solve a lot of the current social ills on a broader level.    However, I don't think the typical millionaire wanting to pay less in taxes hates poor people, but rather he simply has not lived the experience and calm, rational and RESPECTFUL discourse might sway his beliefs.

It's quite wrong, in fact, to oppose equality and freedoms.  But that's not what SJW stand for, now, is it? SJW is about taking something unassailable (racial, gender, sexual equality) and expand it into the crazy zone all while screaming ""you're against equality"" if someone points out the crazy. There's a marked difference between saying ""no matter what gender the person you love, you get to have a legal contract with them"" and ""don't you ever use the word 'sloth,' it's ableist and it triggers me"" or demanding to be addressed as a hamburger-and-fries-kin with associated pronouns."

Like for example with safe spaces, it's a good idea for people in disprivileged groups to have those cuz it can feel isolating being one of the only people on campus in some disprivileged group, and I think a lot of those safe spaces are lifesaving (like LGBT centers preventing suicides and self-harm), and I want everyone to feel safe on a college campuses.

You get these miserable people who are angry at themselves and the world, and they want to lash out at everyone else in a socially acceptable manner, and I think the social justice community has offered them that opportunity on a silver platter. A lot of the ""rules"" (you can't be racist against whites, privileged people have to 'shut up' around the oppressed, etc) create an environment where it's ""okay"" to verbally abuse and bully others. The other person is not allowed to fight back, otherwise they're a ""bad ally"" or, labelled misogynists/transphobic/ablist/racist/etc.   With safe spaces for example, the concept itself is fine, but people twist it into this whole childish clubhouse ""neener neener, you can't come in here! And if you do, you're not allowed to talk and we get to say WHATEVER we want to you!"" So... it's not really a safe space anymore, it's a space where one group gets to abuse another with abandon. And it's not REALLY because they want ""oppressed voices to be heard"" it's because they're miserable assholes who are looking for a target to direct their rage and anger.   If they wanted to REALLY benefit themselves and other marginalized people, they'd spend less time talking about how much privileged groups suck balls and more time coming up with actual practical solutions, which requires actual concrete goals (for example, getting involved with local politics, redrafting laws that harm certain groups, etc).   I was physically, verbally, and emotionally abused in my childhood by one of my parents (I like to joke I'm a card-carrying member of r/raisedbynarcissists) and a lot of the behaviour I see among social justice groups reminds me SO much of the abuse I received. My abusive parent had a whole whack of excuses for why they felt ""in the right"" with their behaviour; they justified abusing their children because ""I was stressed/had health issues/it was your fault for being difficult"" etc.   I've no doubt that many of the people in the social justice community have faced true inequality, or have been mistreated terribly.

Other core tenants were kindness, service to others,  equity, and most importantly, the inherent worth and dignity of every human being. SJWs don't adhere to those. I don't see them working to make society more just.   I really resent them because thanks to them, ""social justice"" has this new negative connotation. The social justice I was raised with was centered around Martin Luther King Jr's  idea of a ""beloved community"", a society where one's race, social status, gender, etc... would have no impact on their quality of life. SJWs don't want that.  I think at best, they are mean spirited and obnoxious,  and at worst, they reinforced the societal divisions that true social justice is about tearing down."

Our laws are practically equal. In fact, the only racially systemic laws and policies I see in practice are those that give minorities a privileged advantage over whites and asians. Women also have similar systemic privileges.   I'm not saying that racism and misogyny no longer exist. It's just that with the few exceptions I mentioned, it is no longer systemic. It is a human condition that will always be prevalent within any society that can never be completely undone, and outside of our governing legal systems, shouldn't even be tried. People have a right to their own opinions, no matter how bigoted those opinions may be.   I also don't believe in other forms of social justice, even when it comes to disparities of wealth and income. Others having more does not make me have less. There is nothing immoral, unjust or wrong about wealth inequality. It's not an issue to be outraged about. People gain wealth by providing necessary or superior goods and comforts to others.

As such, it's only right that a dictionary at least include the SJW definition in supplement, though BS it may be.  Of course, they don't actually want that.

One is that radfems tend to dismiss transexuality as a delusion, while SJWs sometimes expand the definition of trans to include anyone who doesn't conform to all gender stereotypes at all times."
TiADiscussion,3dgjo1,purpleblossom,6,Thu Jul 16 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"I gotta correct something here, more than others like /u/youngrifle  and /u/notatallexpected have. (Please note that I use the terms male/female for sex and men/woman for gender.)   Radical feminists created the ""gender is a social construct"" theory in the 70's to invalidate trans people.  Trans people in the 90's took it up to validate non-binary people and those who don't need to transition completely from their sex to their gender. The 'gender is a social construct' theory actually is contradictory based on their transphobic reasoning that society made up gender (and yes they mix in sex too) so if a male claims to be a woman, it's because they want to ""appropriate women's struggles"" yet if gender is made by society, then there is nothing that stops males from being women and females from being men. Many radical feminists are so certain of their gender that they won't even refer to themselves as women anymore because males have ""sullied it."" The people making up crazy pronouns (and the ones listed here are not counted) are teenagers who either claim to be trans and aren't (transtrenders/genderspecials) or young trans kids so easily taken in by the transphobic feminist gender theory that the main feminist movement has taken and run with (ignoring the original purpose of it and not changing a thing) that they think it's completely logical to make up whatever they want to explain something when they are really trying to quantify the smallest things about themselves and think that will help them in the long run when it hasn't yet for most people because the small things obscure the bigger picture of life."

Of course it probably meant gender roles and stereotypes but it quickly turned into gender identity and recently biological sex.

Quite possibly though, it could be that very experience with overt and ugly racism that led her to become a SJW.  Jessica Valenti (most of you probably heard of her), author of the popular feminist book The Purity Myth. Though that book wasn't necessarily SJW in nature as it was merely a criticism of abstinence-only sex education, abstinence pledges, and the culture of chastity, her other writings have been. Most notably, she has written that fraternities should be abolished, not because of anything about sex discrimination or equality, but rather because she thinks fraternities promote rape and misogyny towards women. That article was written in response to the alleged UVA rape as recounted in the Rolling Stone, which we all know by now was a false allegation.

It's like false accusations when it comes to rape; I think feminists should be very concerned about false accusations because if they create an environment where the mere accusation of rape is enough to damage someone for a lifetime and make the girl a hero, then the credibility of real rape victims will be compromised because people will stop trusting anyone accusing another of rape, even if it's true.

The only reason I even remember it (she wasn't very memorable back then, she's gotten a lot better on the actual delivery, feminist writers or not) is because one of the friends I was with had actually been raped that way, and recently. He left in the middle of that bit and we found him in the bar about ten whiskey sours down."

But if they make nothing but posts like this then they're almost certainly sincere or trolling, ie they want at least some readers to not be in on the joke.  The question becomes one of who they are trolling. Someone who sounds like an over the top extremist SJW could be trolling anti-SJWs (by getting them to react and show that they're falling for strawmen of what SJWs are actually like, showing they have no idea) or SJWs (by mocking them and trying to get them to actually agree with their posts)  Frankly I find them kind of annoying and even disrespectful and wouldn't mind if there was less of this.

I will also say that, having been a moderator here on tumblrinaction for about a year, there are so many blogs that I wanted to believe were satire for reason 1) above, that upon closer inspection clearly were just the tumblr blogs of someone that stupid."

TiADiscussion,3db1pu,Armadilloassault,-10,Fri Jul 17 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"This is just ""Do what I say, not as I do"". It's fine for TiA to miss obvious jokes and work themselves into a tizzy over something innocuous, but it's wrong for Tumblr to do so because of reasons."
TiADiscussion,3db1pu,lifeonthegrid,11,Tue Jul 14 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Like I said, TiA is a subreddit intended for and directed at humour. For those on tumblr that miss the joke, there's no harm if they just miss the joke, but if there's an SJW that takes it and rolls with it to spread misinformation, that's when they need to be called out on it. Likewise, if someone on TiA uses something to spread misinformation, they should be called out on it, too. But that's not the same as trolling along with a post from tumblr. Most of the comments on TiA ""working themselves into a tizzy"" is just them pretending to speak as if they were SJWs performing mental gymnastics anyway."

Yes, people are reactionary, a lot will just go with the flow in a thread like this, it can get annoying. It doesn't help that there have been actual links to posts which say things like this less ironically. Like the one that said black people should pretend to laugh at white people's corny jokes so they don't get shot up. And this sort of thing is hardly unique to TiA.  I do have to agree with u/lifeonthegrid on one thing though, TiA is clearly not solely about humor. I don't think I've laughed at a submission a single time."

TiADiscussion,3db1pu,HerpthouaDerp,-8,Tue Jul 14 22:56:41 2015 UTC,Are you claiming that the only way written satire can be blatant is if an /s is at the end? Satire in the written word predates the internet by more than a few years and plenty of people have been able to figure it out.
TiADiscussion,3db1pu,lifeonthegrid,8,Tue Jul 14 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"First of all, that is not what I am claiming.   like with an ""/s""   ""/s"" was an example - one of the ways it could be explicit.  Second, satire has also been well known before the age of the internet to be hard to communicate effectively, and easy to misunderstand, especially through text. Mix it with the current age of the internet, where written text is much less eloquent and thought out, and it's understandable for people to miss the joke.  EDIT: clarification and fixed redundancy"

Whenever the issue of crimes committed by black people come up, there's always people who are quick to blame a lack of black fathers of the black community being irresponsible for the crime. So by doing the exact same when a white criminal, they're making fun of that entire line of argumentation/pointing out how absurd it is."

TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,Cartesian_Duelist,18,Tue Jul 14 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"I am now immediately suspicious of all women's issues, as it seems they are used as political platforms more than anything. Every seemingly paramount one I've seen almost always amounts to women's choices, or is not actually a real issue. It is increasingly obvious that feminism is merely the secular religion.   Take the Hobby Lobby ruling, for instance: it was the most in the-the-line-with-the-law ruling I've ever seen where my personal convictions--I don't believe private entities should have any say in the health care of the public--were not in line with the law as it was written.   If you took a look on reddit, you'd have swear the Whitehouse was just bombed by extremists and the U.S. was renaming itself to Gilead. Everywhere, histrionic morons acted as if women's rights had just been rolled back 100 years, that this was proof of patriarchy, etc., etc. More level-headed comments talking about how this was a good thing in terms of getting the U.S. closer to a public option and detailed similar situations with employees of religious charities being able to simply petition the government to fill in the gaps left due to the beliefs of their employers within their private insurance were downvoted into oblivion as mansplaining and so on.

TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,Huitzil37,11,Tue Jul 14 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to have a debate about this, but I would say the most important issues right now are a) violence b) access to education c) human trafficking I guess.   Men are more often victims of both A and C (overwhelmingly so in the case of A) and B is not an issue in the regions where feminism is trying to punish people over it.  ""Violence is a women's issue"" is a lie. It is the perfect example of how feminism lies and should never, ever be trusted about anything. Women are safer than men. Women have always been safer than men throughout the entirety of human history. Every single example feminists bring forth of how dangerous it is to be a woman -- NO MATTER WHERE -- is something where men are in more danger of greater harm and feminists ignored it. Those white First World upper middle class feminists are, without exaggeration, the safest any group of human beings has ever been in the last hundred thousand years.   To believe that men need to do more to protect women from violence, that feminism is justified because of the violence women face, is to believe that men's lives have literally no value and their safety should be disregarded entirely."
TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,Cartesian_Duelist,7,Tue Jul 14 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"It's actually overwhelmingly so in the case of C) as well.

TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,Huitzil37,7,Tue Jul 14 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"Except that A: the originator of this thread was talking about White First World feminists, you brought up Third World feminism, it is relevant to talk about how Third World feminism is used to justify First World feminism since that was exactly what you are doing. (The discussion of whether feminism is actually needed in the Third World, as in the thing that is called feminism and has an effect on the world rather than the abstract perfect Platonic ideal that feminists claim but never really exists, is probably too complex to go into here.)  B: When girls are kidnapped or killed for wanting to go to school; boys are still getting it worse. Like, remember Boko Haram in Nigeria? Horrible terrorists. They kidnapped a bunch of girls for going to school, and it caused a huge outrage, people demanded they be stopped, people said this was proof of how dangerous it was to be a woman. Boko Haram kidnapped all the girls... and murdered all the boys. What was more, they had been murdering all the boys for a good while -- six months or more, I am pretty sure -- and just letting the girls go, telling them not to go to school again. Nobody cared. They were murdering boys for trying to get an education, and nobody cared. They continued to murder boys, and started to kidnap girls, and suddenly everyone cared, and only cared about the girls. Women in warzones who go out to gather firewood are regularly caught and raped, and this is used as proof of how horrible women have it... women are the ones doing this because when the men go out to gather firewood, they are regularly caught, raped, and then murdered. But nobody cares, because they are men. Nobody is even capable of perceiving it, because they are men, and the drumbeat of ""men are threatening, women are victims"" goes on unopposed."

TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,iribrise,8,Sun Jul 19 07:32:53 2015 UTC,"No, but I think the background noise is definitely hurting their causes, particular for transgender issues. I'm pretty supportive even though I think the science is out and we need more data. I'd rather behave in a way that doesn't make someone more depressed, as long as they're not telling me to say the sky is green. But every so often, I'll get into a discussion with my boyfriend. He's very pro LGB issues-- he's dating a bisexual, after all, and he's not condescending or weird about that-- but he'll ask, ""what rights do transgender people need that aren't being respected right now?""  And to be honest, even though I read a lot about these things and am quite sympathetic, I can't give back a good answer. A lot of the problems are bureaucratic fixes, like simplifying the standards to have your sex legally changed. Some are impaired by ideology-- he thinks that hormone therapy and reassignment surgeries should only be covered by insurance so often as mental illness medication and therapies are. I don't think the government should write a law enforcing it, so I'm on that boat too. But the way transgender issues are often spoken about, they're asking for things no one gets-- a kind of guarantee of respect for who they are and their validity on this earth. No one gets that. You can't have a ""right to be respected,"" that's not how respect works. It's hard to know what someone's supposed to be campaigning for when the messaging is so unclear.  I think part of the issue is that while in some ways, same sex marriage was also just a bureaucratic demand, people who wanted to get married weren't occasionally telling him that he, as a cis person, was personally responsible for their murder or suicide rate and that kind of rhetoric is very popular for transgender issues."
TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,nikkitgirl,5,Tue Jul 14 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"In some ways there should be a right to be respected, at least by government officials/workers while representing the government. Nobody should be mocked by police officers or DMV workers, and you may think it's a nonissue because it doesn't happen often, but it's not uncommon for trans people. There's also the fact that officially trans people can't serve in the military, and people can be dishonorably discharged for transitioning. Then there's the fact that people are currently trying to take away trans rights with bathroom laws. Furthermore, one of the biggest issues is that along with sexuality, gender identity is not a protected class in most places.  Most of the issues are bureaucratic, social, and/or part of bigger issues, but legal issues still remain."

They have legitimate grievances, but they're neo-Marxists. They wholeheartedly believe a system that's only led to mass suffering and death is the solution to their problems. The only solution.  There are lots of neo-Marxists in the radical left--it comes with the territory, but they're leveraging the gender guilt (yes, I did just modify white guilt) to influence broader feminism to see capitalism as inherently masculine and that violent and Marxist anarcho communism as the answer.  Ever wonder who's pushing the line ""heteropatriacal capitalism"" the hardest? It's the radqueers.  And that scares me, a loud-n-proud democratic socialist."

TiADiscussion,3d8jfj,shouldnbeonreddit,5,Tue Jul 14 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Nope. They're too steeped in complex jargon to get the support of the everyman, too radical to get the support of the loud voices of politicians and celebrities (which they don't want anyway), and, while they have data supporting the legitimacy of their grievances, they don't have data supporting the legitimacy of their proposed solutions. They're just going to continue to distract from and belittle the baby steps that the LGBT+ movement is making because every baby step made by the progressives is a baby step away from the mass discomfort and subsequent upheaval required to enact the radical, violent revolution they want.  In short, they're basically tilting windmills because progressivism, the dominant force right now, is the enemy of neo-Marxism."

SJW types are hurting very worthy causes with their atrocious behaviour.  Someone mentioned being ""immediately suspicious"" in another comment and I think that's a good way to put it.

The only difference is the party they vote for, if they vote at all, because the minorities think that the Republicans are for rich white people (not completely off the mark, but given their own views...).  The cause of that? They aren't educated to be any better. The culture of most poorer places around the world, rural and inner-city America being no exception, is that of ignorance, and with ignorance comes old, outdated ideas about the role of women and homosexuality (roughly the same all over the world; most pre-modern societies were patriarchal and intolerant of homosexuality). Though it's aided by religion, it is not the primary cause; poor rural people in, say, China and Vietnam have the same attitudes without Christian/Islamic religion.   The educated Hispanics and blacks that I know are not like this, but unfortunately, most of the Hispanics and blacks I know that went to my college became either SJWs or close friends with SJWs, because there is a lot of pressure at top-tier private schools to ""represent"" your race/ethnicity if you're an underrepresented minority.

I'm black, and when I was younger I would say both white and black people expressed an equal amount of homophobia. But when I grew older, the tide shifted, and I found black people expressing it in harsher ways, and white people became more tolerant and supportive.   Personally I'm not too fond of the ""white colonialist"" excuse. Mainly because I feel that people are responsible for their own actions, and they can choose what they want to believe. I find this excuse dehumanizing as if to say black people have no control over their thoughts and do whatever the white man tells them to.   I grew up in a strict religious household, and despite being taught how evil the LGBT was, I personally came to the conclusion that everything my church said was full of shit. And I don't see why others can't do the same.   Homophobia in PoC communities is a big elephant in the room, that somehow the press seems to look away from. Buzzfeed may be quick to pull tweets from white right wing conservatives, but in my reality, I might stumble into the BET comment section and read about how ""we are in the end of days"" and how ""disgusting"" I am for having a rainbow avatar. (And that's just a sample of the nicer comments.)  I'm not going to argue over which race is more homophobic or what not, but I would like to see social justice communities, especially the mainstream press, spend more time encouraging LGBT equality within PoC communities. I think it's a thing we've been ignoring for too long, and the ""white colonialist"" argument gives people an excuse to continue behaving terribly to LGBT youth.   To put it this way, complaining about white people doesn't fix the situation I'm in, but reaching out, educating, and encouraging tolerance in PoC communities will do wonders to my quality of life."

From what I have seen Blacks and to a lesser extent Latinos tend to have a higher percentage of uber christians. Uber Christians tend to be homophobic. So higher percentage of uber christians tends to lead to a higher percentage of homophobia.   Also it seems like white culture in general is more open to homosexual activity. For example, I didnt really associate with white people(almost entirely due to my geographical location. I aint gunna lie I lived in the hood. There arnt many whites in the hood) until I went to highschool. Because of that the difference between black and white culture is fairly startling. One thing I noticed is that White men engage in much much much more behavior that could be percieved as homo erotic than Black men do. Just off the top of my head things like the wide exception of gay jokes, sack tapping, and just the general openess about the male sexuality that isnt explicitly about females just doesnt go down in the black community. I never heard one of my black friends talk about what porn they jack off to, but I've heard many of my white friends bring it up. I also played football, both in the hood and in highschool. On the highschool team the majority of the team showered together and there were alot of shenangians, like manginas. That type of behavior among a group of black dudes would be unspeakable."

While there is no such evidence for ""species dysphoria"".   Quick example: studies show that trans people have brains structured closer to the gender they identify with than to the sex they were born as. Whereas, a human can't have the brain of a dog or a dragon.  We have a scientific theory for how trans people can come about. The current thought is that trans people are the result of abnormal hormone fluctuations in utero. Basically the same mechanism that leads to certain types of intersex conditions. But we don't have a scientific theory for how otherkin can come about. It's not like there are ""human hormones"" that can get mixed with ""dragon hormones"" in utero. To truly be an animal in a human's body is an impossibility. Whereas it is very plausible that someone can be a woman in a male's body or vice versa, given what we know about how hormones effect the brain and body (and that's not even taking into account agreed-upon sociological principles like the difference between sex and gender)."

TiADiscussion,3d6cp2,CanadianWizardess,29,Mon Jul 13 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"It is a common misconception that being trans has to do with gender roles or stereotypes.

Most of that stuff is societal.  What I mean by ""female/male brain structure"" are things like men having more grey matter than women, women having larger corpus callosums than men, etc. It's pretty well accepted in the field that the human brain is sexually dimorphic. The WRONG thing to do would be to conclude things about men and women and gender based off of these brain differences. Ie; ""oh, men have more grey matter, so they're obviously better thinkers."" We cannot draw conclusions like that.   Our brain wiring and hormone levels effect both our sense of self and how we view our bodies. My favourite discussion has to do with the brain ""map"". The brain maps out the body. As in, arm is here, leg there. It's why you can touch your toe without looking, because your brain just ""knows"" it's there. It's also why phantom limb syndrome exists. There is some evidence that trans people have a brain map of the opposite sex. This is why, for a trans man, having breasts and a vagina seem so wrong, because his brain literally doesn't recognize them. Instead, the brain thinks there should be a penis, but a penis search sends up a 404 error signal. This is basically the reason for gender dysphoria. Pretty interesting stuff."

No, I don't think it makes sense to classify gender dysphoria as a mental illness. For one, the brains of people with mental illnesses (like depression and schizophrenia) almost always show abnormalities, whereas the brains of trans people are technically normal and healthy, they just aren't congruent with the person's sex. The condition lies not with the brain itself (or with the body itself), but with the misalignment between brain and body. Two, gender dysphoria can't be treated like other mental illnesses can be treated; ie, with talk therapy or medication aimed at altering brain chemistry. Three, classifying gender dysphoria as a mental illness has no clinical utility.  It's better to think of gender dysphoria as being an endocrine or neurological disorder, rather than a mental disorder."

TiA believes what it believes on this issue out of fear of being called conservative...or worse...""transphobic.""  TiA is bending over backwards to accept a position that simply isn't true and doesn't make sense. Furthermore, the sex/gender distinction does not support the TiA orthodoxy, but does just the opposite.  Take Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner's sex is male. Jenner's gender is feminine. But TiA has bought the completely false SJW line that woman is a gender. 'Woman' means adult female human. Jenner, being unequivocally male, is therefore unequivocally a man. A feminine man. WHICH IS COMPLETELY COOL. I'll fight for his right to wear dresses...but the very point of the sex/gender distinction is that being of eg feminine gender does nothing to effect your sex...which is male or female depending on your biology, and which has nothing to do with your gender. Against these very clear arguments, TiA marshalls some shaky brain pseudoscience and some garbled gender studies sophistries... On these issues, TiA is full SJW."

Autism spectrum disorder has a rate of occurrence of 1 in 68 in the U.S., which is close to 10 times higher.

TiADiscussion,3d6cp2,Mouon,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Being trans is in no way similar to having schizophrenia or autism spectrum. The APA states specifically that being transgender is not a mental disorder, and gender dysphoria is classified as a medical disorder in the DSM (and basically the only reason gender dysphoria is still in the DSM is to ensure standards of care for trans people).  Can you give me an example of society being rearranged or pandering to trans people? Because I honestly can't think of one. It seems to me that it's more the opposite: society is stacked against them in almost every way."

If it was all about identity, and we had to respect whatever people ""identify as"", then identity would exclusively become a thing people manipulated in order to demand a particular type of treatment or accommodation from others.   The actual difference is because of the empirical evidence we have of the existence of transgender people, and our knowledge of gendered fetal development. Most people don't actually know that difference, because most people adopt new social premises by being shamed and ridiculed for not thinking them, convincing themselves they always believed it, and then shaming and ridiculing others for not thinking those things."

If you'd like to dispute that comparison, feel free to do so logically. You cannot, however, just say that it's invalid and leave it at that.  For the latter, I was under the impression that the current modern movement was to define ""gender"" exactly as how people ""identify"", with ""sex"" being reserved for any biological component."
TiADiscussion,3d6cp2,MosDaf,8,Mon Jul 13 23:36:55 2015 UTC,"You cannot, however, just say that it's invalid and leave it at that.   Because no matter what species people identify as, they are still human even if they think they are not. In any case its not 'identifying themselves' that determines what they are, but rather how they are innately in their mind.  Whereas in the case of trans people, they innately in their mind have a gender thats contrary to their sex. Its not a matter of how they identify, but of how they are. Otherwise anyone could identify however they wanted and their gender, species or whatever would change accordingly, which would be absurd.    I was under the impression that the current modern movement was to define ""gender"" exactly as how people ""identify"", with ""sex"" being reserved for any biological component.   Correct, but anyone who applies reason can work out that thats clearly nonsense. If it were simply self identification, then trans people would be able to choose to identify as the same gender as their sex and 'cure' themselves from being trans, but we know that can't happen. It can't be a mere social construct, gender has to be something people are born with - a natural wiring in the mind to think and feel and act in certain ways characteristic of one gender or another. Each gender not being arbitrary social constructs, but real neurological differences that usually appear between men and women. Sure there is traditional and social fluff and norms etc associated with gender, but it itself is clearly a real objective thing in our minds. Its not a coincidence that in the vast majority of cases people have the same gender as their sex - its because they are interwoven, and when they are not, when gender and sex are not aligned, it causes serious problems for people - i.e. transpeople.   Men and women are naturally different in the mind:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hope-relationships/201402/brain-differences-between-genders  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2711771/  The thing is, the brain is both neurological and pychological, and a person's psychology is based off their neurology, and their neurology is biological. Sure there are social factors too, but in effect, gender is biological. Its only by semantic categorization that gender and sex are put in different boxes, despite them being interwoven and usually coinciding."

TiADiscussion,3d31ss,RytheGuy97,27,Mon Jul 13 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"Tumblr (like Facebook, LiveJournal, and Twitter) is REALLY focused on personal identity.  In each of those spaces, when people talk about something, the identity of the person talking in at least as important as what they are saying.  Making it a really natural fit for ideologies centering on identity politics concerns (although FB is mostly reigned in because you're performing identity stuff mainly for people you know in real life, where normal rules of social civility keep people somewhat more in check).  At the other end of the spectrum, 4chan has an extremely aggressive anti-identity culture.  Every is Anon (except for moot).  I think reddit is somewhere in between the two.  When I'm reading conversation threads on reddit, I almost never, ever recognize (or even pay attention to) the names of who's writing, except locally up a thread.  (note that reddit communities and chan boards DO have their own group identities, of course - I'm just talking about the role of personal identities in the course of normal conversations)  So you could say, if you agree with that, that reddit's culture about personal identity (and the values around it) are just deeply at odds with tumblr et. al.  From a certain perspective, you could say reddit cares, generally, within subreddits, much more about arguments and ideas than who is saying them...  ... which is exactly and precisely why folks from these more identity-oriented communities have to come in and announce that if you don't care about identity, it just proves that you are a straight, white, cis, hyper privileged male.  Because according to their ideologies, no one can ever escape their identities.  Not caring about some aspect of identity is the literal definition of privilege.  Note, too, that in saying I think reddit cares more about ideas, I'm not saying it is automatically any better at having, recognizing, or caring about thoughtful, nuanced, or complex ideas.  Sometimes it is, very often it isn't.  But in most of the bigger subs, there's usually not too much focus on interpersonal drama between our pseudononymous handles inside the subs themselves...  ... except for in cases where mods or admins are involved who are (wait for it) heavily identity-based and recognizably connected to those identities...  ...or in cases where the identities of various subreddit communities are in conflict (say, KotakuInAction and GamerGhazi, or TheRedPill and several subs, or Atheism and christianity, or...), hence the no-brigading rule, to prevent that kind of interpersonal drama.  You could take this a step further and say that one of the core argument of the Enlightenment is that ideas can be separated from identities.  Communities based on identity politics ideologies flatly deny that's possible.  Other communities (like reddit at it's best, I think) would say that that is an ideal worth aspiring to - maybe we can't ever fully transcend our the particularities of our own identities, but we can strive to, and wallowing in them just makes people into wildly awful divisive uncharitable tribal dumb assholes.  One might argue."

TiADiscussion,3d31ss,pineyfusion,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how the different ways social websites are set up has a strong influence on how the hive mind of its community develops. As someone who's been on Tumblr a while, the way the community works is so different than any forum could ever be.  On Tumblr you have to have followers to be seen and the people with the most followers get the final say in everything. There's sort of this weird cult of personality surrounding the popular bloggers,  not unlike youtube stars or ya know, actual celebrities. Someone tries to argue with a popular blogger and they get laughed at by all their followers and sent messages. If you have a lot of followers you don't even have to argue just say something like ""lmao"" and they'll immediately be validated by all their followers.  It's this bizarre kind of system where only the people with the most followers get a say in anything and at the point the community's at now the only people who are going to get to that point are ones that submit to their narrow worldview. It's very... authoritarian. Reddit is kind of in between like you said. For the most part anybody can have a say in anything and have it seen although sometimes you get upvoted or downvoted by the particular hive mind of whatever sub you're on. 4chan is on the other end of this spectrum. Almost everyone is anonymous and there's no kind of point system but this leads to a lot of boards being kind of a clusterfuck.  Although I've never seen someone connect the way the website focuses on personal identity with the identity politics that are so prevalent in the community now. That was really enlightening."

It's easier (slightly) to produce an echochamber on tumblr than on reddit so it attracted people who (rightly) fear dissent.   Modding a sub like /r/communism requires active work to remove all the trolls, but with tumblr all a user who sees an objectionable viewpoint has to do is unfollow, or delete the post.  As a result on tumblr it is easier to deal with opposing views (by ignoring them) and continuing on with your own perspective.  It's no accident that tumblr has a prominent Neo Nazi community, insular ideologies must by definition love tumblr for what it provides, a place to stew."

TiADiscussion,3d31ss,notatallexpected,3,Mon Jul 13 15:22:21 2015 UTC,Bias in moderation is a very quick way to produce an echo chamber on reddit.

Unless someone is threatening you, and threatening people is disallowed, effecting their real life than you can just not read, or disagree with comments you find bigoted. The bigots do deserve to stay on reddit because reddit is a discussion platform."
TiADiscussion,3d31ss,lifeonthegrid,-3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"It's a straight up fact that no one has a right to post on reddit. Reddit has never had completely free speech. And some people disagree with the ethos of blindly supporting free speech in all contexts.    Reddit being more progressive on some issues isn't the result of free speech, it's the result of demographics. And people would still be able to debate abortion or talk about weed without being able to devote entire subs to the hatred of minorities or encouraging rape.   Reddit is a discussion platform which is dragged down by bigots, who have ruined several subs that have nothing to do with bigotry. Discussion can and does exist without blatant bigotry. I have had plenty of real life discussions, none of which would have been improved by a stranger in the corner screaming about the Jews."

Having subs dedicated to hate speech are easy to avoid, I simply don't go to them and the odd bigoted comment I refute or ignore. That's also making reddit a place of approved debate topics.   A big point of internet conversation in general is being able to debate topics that would be considered inappropriate in real life. Things like abortion or weed aren't really controversial topics anymore like they were ten years ago.

I disagree that reddit would become a place of approved debate topics if they banned hate subs. Those subs aren't about debate, they're about promoting their own brands of bigotry.

Also, the time he lived in was very different, when you could justifiably say that their was a lot of racism, that black people were discriminated against and men generally had more of a say so in society.  50 years on we've achieved a lot of equality in the west, we've enacted equality laws and have made or are in the process of making a lot of progress, and we don't really need a load of whiny teens or ivory tower academics messing it up.   Many people don't have an issue with freedom and justice for all and if that's all SJW's wanted then I doubt many people would have an issue as such, but they go about things by blaming 'white-men' for slavery as if we still hold slaves or something.  My issue with SJW's is how they twist these goals, and social-democracy and barely understand what they're saying, I don't think from what I know of Martin Luther King that he was so ill informed about what he was trying to achieve."

The campus administrators who redefined consent in response to the rape hysteria we've had in recent years ""actually did things"". Hell, those who rioted in Ferguson, Baltimore and elsewhere ""actually did things"". I don't quite agree with the SJW = slacktivist definition; SJWs can ""actually do things"" for their cause. Not that MLK was definitely a SJW, but that's not how you tell a SJW.   we don't really need a load of whiny teens or ivory tower academics messing it up.   My point was that it's quite possible that MLK would consider those ""whiny teens"" or those ""ivory tower academics"" to be for the most part correct, given what we know of him and his views. It's quite possible that he would side with the SJWs today. There's no guarantee, but I consider it a strong probability.   they go about things by blaming 'white-men' for slavery as if we still hold slaves or something.   MLK seems to have believed in collective guilt, given his statements on ""white people"" and ""white moderates"", with those moderates referring to those that didn't quite go as far as him. He was very eloquent with what he said, and in the end he did a lot of great things, but I wrote this thread because I feel like his radical side is ignored by most people and he is seen by the American public as a more moderate figure than he actually was. Somehow, I would get the impression that he would be lumped in the same category as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, which means that lots of modern-day people would see him as a SJW if he were alive today."

MLK did live in another time where what he was saying had some relevance, whether he would agree or now is up to any ones guess though, we'll never know.

I think I could agree with some things that SJW's want, I'm sure we could all find something in any ideology that isn't bad, I'm not an SJW so I don't give into the 'us' and 'them' identity politics that SJW's do, it's their methods, the hate and the pseudo-politics that I could never agree with."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,lifeonthegrid,3,Tue Jul 14 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my point wasn't ""OMG MLK was a SJW"" but rather that I'm struggling to figure out if I was right in calling those who condoned the riots SJWs, given that they claim that MLK would have supported them. I sincerely hope that MLK wouldn't have, but if he did I would either have to say that MLK was a SJW and would be one today, or not call those people SJWs, which is what they were going for. Ultimately, MLK didn't live long enough for us to know, but I speculate sometimes to question my own beliefs about MLK and what he stood for - I know modern portrayals of him are a bit too sanitized, and know he was a bit of a radical...but I don't know if he would approve or disapprove of the modern SJWs."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,lifeonthegrid,5,Tue Jul 14 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem to me like MLK was condoning, excusing, or encouraging rioting but explaining that the rioters are people who felt like they're left with no other recourse in order to be heard. And that it's wrong to use the riots as an excuse to ignore their cause or castigate the people.  If someone used the same words in response to riots today I still wouldn't consider them an SJW. A lot of black people in America today are in a really bad position in society and at least on some level this is reinforced by racism.  What crosses into SJW territory is saying that whole cities should be burned to the ground to make white people understand what it feels like to have a shitty life, or that any white person who doesn't endorse rioting and looting regardless of the circumstances is clearly a racist. Which are actual things I've seen people say. That's pretty much the cornerstone of being an SJW in my mind: focusing on how nasty white people (or man, or cis people, etc) are, how they have no business speaking and need to constantly reflect on how great their life is and think of what they can do to help those poor people they're oppressing. I really don't get that vibe from any quotes I've seen from MLK, he was really fighting for improving conditions for people by addressing specific societal problems."

I'm questioning if I was wrong in calling people who condone the rioting SJWs, given that MLK did indeed say this, and I wondered if those SJWs were indeed carrying on his legacy, which is more rebellious and radical than what typical people imagine it to be."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,not_his_nibs,4,Tue Jul 14 02:20:23 2015 UTC,"If you think MLK was too forceful in his demands, then that reflects more on you than on him."

If you honestly think that being hesitant about the prospect of abolishing capitalism, for example, reflects poorly on me as a person, then I'm not sure what to say to you. I am not speaking of his protests against segregation, or against poor working conditions, but rather some of the more radical things he has said and done, things that gave pause to moderates and liberals of the time. It's some of the lesser-known things about him that gives me this conclusion - what he was known for was only the tip of the iceberg."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,ClintHammer,2,Tue Jul 14 00:14:28 2015 UTC,His protests against segregation and poor working conditions did give pause to moderates of the time. There were and are people who are more concerned with a disruption of the status quo than they are with actually dealing with any of the issues. Trying to advance social progress inevitably creates discomfort and worrying too much about people's feelings/comfort is an albatross.
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,lifeonthegrid,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"His protests against segregation and poor working conditions did give pause to moderates of the time.   True. But given TiAD's generally center-left political leanings, I just think that many of us would have considered MLK, rightly or wrongly, to be a SJW if he were alive today. He was pretty far to the left for both the 1960s and now, and given his ""you're either with us or against us"" stance, I can't help but think that some of us would have been the ""white moderates"" he complained about because we have question marks over what happened with Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Freddie Gray."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,ClintHammer,2,Tue Jul 14 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"MLK was right about many things but he also was incorrect about some, because he was human. He cheated on his wife, he engaged in plagiarism he also is a huge reason why the civil rights movement succeed. No person is infallible. He is an admirable man, but that doesn't mean it's wrong to disagree with him on some things.  I think SJWs are taking the wrong part of his legacy. It's how he really helped bring America together, helped integrate it, uses non violent protest that is MLK 's lasting achievement. Especially now there is no excuse for rioting, it is of no help to anyone. We need to prosecute and punish people who participate in and cause riots."

Especially now there is no excuse for rioting, it is of no help to anyone. We need to prosecute and punish people who think participate in and cause riots.   That's what I was hoping for, but I sometimes wonder if the SJWs are merely a continuation of MLK's legacy, which is far more complicated and less clean than what most Americans see it as. If that's the case, then I would have to either say that MLK was a SJW, or (what the SJWs were going for) that I was wrong in calling them SJWs, because they are picking up where MLK left off. I think people tend to forget that their heroes were not always perfect (case in point: Nelson Mandela was a violent saboteur prior to his imprisonment, which is where he learned his peaceful ways), and so you can disagree with something a ""hero"" does. I think what the whole debate over what MLK represented during the riots was what MLK meant to them: whether he was a saint devoted to the cause of non-violent protest, or a revolutionary bent on overthrowing the oppressive system that we had (and according to the SJWs) have today, non-violently if possible, but violently if necessary. You could make cases for both depending on what you quote from him, which is why to many historians his legacy is actually quite complicated and subject to different interpretations."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,ClintHammer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"I think asking if MLK was an SJW is the wrong question as SJWs are a modern occurrence, they are distinctly a product of modern over protective parenting, internet culture, post modern/post structure academic thought radically simplified, these are all things that didn't really take off until MLK had already passed.   MLK was a civil rights activist, SJWs aren't big fans of civil rights like free speech. They don't have the pragmatism of Dr. King, he lived in the real world and wasn't dealing with things like microagressions. The closest they come to continuing in that tradion is they claim a link to it, to absorb some of the legitimacy the civil rights movement has.   If anything they are probably close to Malcolm X (I am biased, as I really don't like what Malcolm X stood for, am of the opinion it did much more harm than good), in support of violence, rioting etc (King was understanding of how people were driven to it, which is different than considering it a positive response or a productive one)... they are closer to the part of the civil rights movement Dr. King was critical of, and even then I think they'd be criticized for being sloppy and unfocused in their actions.  I've come to think of being a hero, is something a person does, not something they are. We should be able to admire heroic actions, heroic attributes while also wanted to avoid the flaws of great men and women."
TiADiscussion,3d6m68,ClintHammer,2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always find it ironic when SJWs say stuff like ""MLK would have supported us"", bringing out that quote about rioting, when they have a much more accessible figure in Malcolm X. I guess it's their attempt to make themselves look better, and there has been no shortage of blog articles during Ferguson/Baltimore about how MLK would have been fine with the rioting, or how ""white people"" (non-SJWs) misuse MLK's legacy to shut down legitimate expression of anger."

TiADiscussion,3cycvt,Cartesian_Duelist,5,Sun Jul 12 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"So, politically speaking, I am a strong individualist myself, but /u/lifeonthegrid raises a good point. The logic here is deeply flawed. There is a little nugget of wisdom buried in the poop though. Identity politics as a whole demands a dangerous question ""Who is entitled to an opinion?"" Unlike most political issues, being on reddit actually qualifies as taking a stand on this question; reddit is, after all, built on principles of absolute freedom of speech, and by corollary, freedom of opinion.  In the recent years of my life I've had the pleasure of meeting a lot of people who I can talk these issues about, an I'm often quoted as saying ""I've had about enough of 'us and them politics' things would be a little better with some more 'you and me politics'."" This is because of a couple different reasons:  1) Group identity excludes conversation. Its possible to talk to member x of 'group x' and perhaps change their opinion, but any logical progress you can make will be undone when they return to their social circle (i.e. Tumblr). People have changed the way I see the world talking to me face to face. Identity politics, by its very nature, puts a buffer between its members and other ways of thinking.  2) The nugget of wisdom in OP's quote: No two people have the same experience or whole identity. To say that ""These are the issues that face us and this is how we are going to deal with them"" demands either that a member of group x either concede, and potentially compromise something else they stand for - or be forced to say ""because I don't agree with thing tangential to group x I must not have identity X"" An easy example would be a feminist who believes in a statute of limitations on abortions (""Sometime around x months a fetus becomes a human baby with its own rights"" would be the logic I was picturing).  In any case, politics based on identity is a bad idea. Of course, you all may disagree, potentially for very good reasons. If that's the case you should say so to me and You and I can talk about it."

It's an interesting fault to note with representative (as opposed to directly democratic) systems of government like what the US employs. Representation means that inevitably (unless you are the representative) you'll have to sacrifice some of your opinions for the ones that matter most when you vote. That results in lumping into groups, and then those groups sacrifice and lump further and so you wind up with the two-party system that we all know and hate. Huzzah!"
TiADiscussion,3cycvt,AmoebaMan,3,Mon Jul 13 21:08:10 2015 UTC,"""By acknowledging that different traits interact, you're ceding that no two people are truly comparable and alike and thus its pretty much useless to divide them up into groups and pretend all members of said group are the same/have the same experience""  This is a terrible argument/conclusion. Saying that people's experience's aren't identical isn't the same as saying no experiences are comparable or similar. That's a huge leap in logic.   And the second half completely misses the point of intersectionality. Intersectionality acknowledges that people have different identities, which results in different experiences. Intersectionality explicitly argues that individuals have different experiences and that there isn't a homogenous experience based on a single identity."
TiADiscussion,3cycvt,lifeonthegrid,4,Sat Jul 11 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"It's also assumes that it means that their interests are mutual and not competing.   On a slightly different poimt intersectionality's problem is it requires the leap of faith that all oppressed groups benefits, won't be at the cost of another. Also it only aknowledegs indentity in complications from overlapping membership. The conclusion of indentity being personally varied is eventually you have to see it isn't membership(s) based, that it can go beyond the social to the sheer individual. Group membership is nothing more than a flawed proxy from individual wants, needs etc..."

Sure, things have gotten waaay better, but It wasn't that long ago when I was growing up that the idea we would be we are today was absurd.    And I remember back then, It was basically a fact that Lesbians would receive social acceptance more easily in the mainstream than Gay men; because a woman who is a lesbian is still a woman.   And isn't breaking the rules of ""femininity"" by dating other women.    Whereas a man who dates men lost some element of his manhood in the eyes of the mainstream.    That stigma has  been vanishing lately;   And now that things are more equal, the history is being revised.    I think the problem, at its core, is that the SJW scene is chock full of people who are just pissed off and angry.

I think most people involved in social justice activism wholeheartedly believe in creating a just society, rather than a vendetta. But I do think social media as a medium of activism is conducive to creating echo chambers and grandstanding, and it's far easier (and let's be real here, more fun) to grandstand an extreme idea than a moderate one.

TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,Bannedfromthenet,23,Sat Jul 11 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"I think you've confused being gender fluid and being transgender. Those terms are usually distinct, though they both involve gender dysphoria.    Let's say you're biologically a girl. ...you hate all your girl features like your boobs. You just really want to be a boy. You want to have a male body and such. Or maybe it's the opposite. Or something different.   Your example describes a transgender man - a person born biologically female who self-identifies with the male gender. This person is NOT gender fluid. He accepts traditional views of gender and identifies with one of them (male). He just happens to lack the physical body to match his mental state.  While I can understand being transgender, I cannot wrap my head around the idea of gender fluidity. Can one be gender fluid but not transgender? If so, how? If not, why bother with two different labels?"
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,wave538demon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:10:16 2015 UTC,From an outsiders perspective I feel like it just seems like extreme gender dysphoria and that you are never comfortable with your gender. Although this seems like a serious issue more than a gender identity.
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,Tommybeast,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:05:24 2015 UTC,"Well I guess I should have explained it out better. They may identify with the male gender,but other times not identify as the male gender other times they may be okay with the female gender or want to  be none.  It isn't a picking and choosing thing from one day to the next or the like.  The way I understand it is you can be Transgender and not gender fluid.  This is to say that you may want to be biologically one gender and translation to  to the other and be okay with that. So that's not genderfluid.  But you can transition to the other gender and want to be the different one or nether. Then you are transgender and gender-fluid.  From what I know genderfluid or gendqueer falls into Trans issue but it's not necessarily Trans in that some people don't transition for one reason or another.   I just know it involves gender dysphoria.  Also the ""kill all cishets"" people are a problem.  But there are people that have gender dysphoria where it's like there trapped between two spaces is the best way I can put it."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,9,Sun Jul 12 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"That's not being genderfluid,that's just not being a complete stereotype.  Defending nonsense like this cheapens the meaning of the word dysphoria.   If you only have dysphoria some times, you're just a typically awkward teenager.   Gender dysphoria isn't a teenage phase or peeing sitting down, or any other angst, it's a recognized disorder with diagnostic criteria and accepted treatment."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,lifeonthegrid,4,Sun Jul 12 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"Plenty of other mental conditions vary in their intensity and symptoms, why couldn't dysphoria?"
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,4,Sun Jul 12 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work like that.   Someone who is very tidy doesn't have ""ocd light"" they have a normal range personality trait.   Some degree of a variance from the median in gender identity isn't a gender identity unto itself.   It's possible for some people to suffer more from their dysphoria than others, but that doesn't mean that genderfluid is a medically accepted thing.  Tomboy is also not a medical diagnosis, it's a normal range personality trait, not a physiological disorder. Treating it as such does a disservice to literally everyone involved"
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,lifeonthegrid,9,Sun Jul 12 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Plenty of mentally ill people have depressive/anxious/bipolar episodes. Their symptoms don't manifest 24/7, but that the lack of symptoms at a given moment is not an absence of the condition itself.   Dysphoria could also manifest itself in more than one form."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,jelly_cake,6,Sun Jul 12 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Replying here because it seems most relevant, but it's more a reply to all of your comments in this chain.  You're 100% right about dysphoria coming in varying degrees of severity and time. One of the more frequent topics of discussion in /r/asktransgender is how dysphoria comes and goes, and how sometimes feeling ""ok"" with your gender doesn't mean you're not trans. Also, there are many types of dysphoria (e.g. social, genital), some of which can be difficult to recognise, (e.g. hormonal dysphoria). People experience these in differing amounts.  Also, for anyone who's curious, AMA. I'm binary MtF, and have been on HRT for about five months."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,EmptyEmptyInsides,2,Sun Jul 12 05:24:13 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about something. Have you ever found binary trans people resenting or having difficulty taking seriously genderfluid people?  I ask because for at least a lot of trans men and women there is an assertion that their gender identity is in some way physiological, something they were born with and perhaps recognized at a very young age. Someone who switches between gender identities would seem to fly in the face of this, suggesting instead a psychological or perhaps hormonal condition, or a sociological response. Which opens the door for arguments that gender identity is something that can be treated, or that a trans man or woman could actually be genderfluid and therefore may regret undergoing potentially compromising and difficult to reverse procedures like SRS.  Is any of this a reflection of the truscum vs tucute dichotomy that is often referenced on TiA?  I've seen some backlash in the analogous situation of LGB vs people who claim fluidity in sexual orientation."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,jelly_cake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:31:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a huge amount of contact with other trans people; pretty much all my friends are cis, most of them are straight. On the internet, most of the trans people I've talked to would be accepting of genderfluid people. I don't personally have any problems with ""tucutes"", although I don't really see the point.  Interesting that you mention fluid sexuality. The subreddits/communities I'm part of seem to generally endorse it as an idea. The notion of a fixed sexual orientation from birth fits some, maybe even most people, but the general view seems to be that it can (legitimately) change for others. The important distinction is that it's not a ""choice"" or something voluntary; it's still inherent to the person. It's like the weather: it changes, but you can't choose it."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,5,Wed Jul 15 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"That still doesn't mean that genderfluid is anything but a label.   Like I said elsewhere otherkin is a label.   It might even be caused by an actual disorder, but that still doesn't make it a ""thing""."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,lifeonthegrid,2,Sun Jul 12 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"If people experience dysphoria in waves or in cycles, in a way that is different from people who identify as trans do, it's a thing."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,-2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"Normal people also feel that.   They don't like changing with the other boys in gym, or they are uncomfortable with various gender roles throughout their life. That's in the normal range, especially in adolescents.   Treating that with hormone therapy or even more drastic surgical procedures (as op suggested) would be medically irresponsible."

However, it isn't hard to imagine someone who lives with dysphoria, yet have varying levels of dysphoria as time passes."

It's a way many people actually feel.  It's not just some of the time,but a significant portion of the time.  I'd say for a lot of people there's a lot of questioning involved about gender.  It's not about activities or how you go to the bathroom. Let's say your a female biologically.  It's sort of like being between things. Sometimes you may want to look act behave and be male for all intents and purposes and all that brings. Other times you may feel that you don't want to be or look like any gender.    Lots of LGBT places and therapist deal with Genderqueer issues like this."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,0,Sun Jul 12 01:04:25 2015 UTC,They deal with otherkin issues too.   That doesn't make it a disorder.

And I pointed out that therapists deal with otherkin, but that doesn't make it real, you switched gears and only wanted to talk about lbgt centres as if that was a higher authority.   If you go to a therapist and you tell them you think you're a wolf, and you say you read about it online and it's called otherkin, he's not going to say ""That's not a thing"" and kick you out, but it doesn't make it a thing either"
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,2,Sun Jul 12 01:37:05 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about therapist though I know I mentioned them but I mean places that have resources for people in the LGBT Umbrella.
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,wave538demon,0,Sun Jul 12 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the same people who put forth gender fluidity also argue that gender roles are stereotypes that society creates and perpetuates, so there isn't necessarily a contradiction there.   A better definition of gender fluidity might be a constant state of dysphoria, where one is incapable of being comfortable with any traditional gender label. This would exclude those who identify with one gender but sometimes feel that they don't always conform to that role.   It would also exclude the transgendered - even if a genderfluid person changed their outward sex through hormones and surgery, they would still lack a stable gender identity to match that new appearance."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,jelly_cake,0,Sun Jul 12 01:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's coherent with itself, but that doesn't mean it's right.   Something built off a false premise can follow along logically and still be wrong.   Look at everything the ancient Greeks believed."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,Princeso_Bubblegum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I'm right because of internal consistency.  We have a group of people who do not fit into our existing gender labels. For clarity's sake, we need to find a label for how these people view their gender identity. Hence, gender fluid.   All I'm saying is that, again for the sake of clarity, we need to define gender fluid so that it only refers to gender fluid people, and not tomboys, girly guys, angsty teenagers seeking attention, or the transgendered who would be perfectly fine living as either male or female."
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,wkpaccount,-1,Sun Jul 12 02:13:42 2015 UTC,So you feel the best answer is to add more labels?
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,Penguin--Soldier,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Answer to what? There are people whose genders are neither male or female. Labeling them as ""gender fluid"" is not a solution to their dysphoria; it's a convenience of language."

TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,wkpaccount,2,Sun Jul 12 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm almost disappointed that I missed this argument because of timezones. Anyway.  Genderfluid people experience their gender as a variable thing. Sometimes they feel comfortable with certain pronouns, other times different ones. Sometimes they feel their body should be a certain way, other times it's different. (That doesn't mean they just sometimes notice their dysphoria and sometimes don't. It means they sometimes actively feel like their body should be one way, and sometimes actively feel like it should be another, incompatible way).  Genderqueer is sort of an umbrella term for nonbinary, i.e. anyone who's not just a man or a woman. Genderfluid is a type of nonbinary, but not the only type. Not all nonbinary people have fluctuating dysphoria in that way.  Also: nonbinary is a type of transgender, because transgender means ""gender different to that assigned at birth"". If you want to distinguish between nonbinary people, it's clearer to say ""binary trans people"".  (And while I'm here: I'm nonbinary, AMA)"
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,ClintHammer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:26:57 2015 UTC,What is it that makes you feel nonbinary? I've always had a hard time trying to understand anything outside of the binary because I can't imagine that you don't feel like anything.
TiADiscussion,3cyl5h,wkpaccount,2,Sun Jul 12 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly know - all I know is that I don't actively feel like a man or a woman. Other contributing factors are that I feel much more comfortable being referred to using singular they (rather than he or she), using a gender-neutral name, non-gendered words (like person rather than man or woman), and that I would feel much happier if my physical sex characteristics were different."

I just went over to Google scholar and I didn't see any respectable peer reviewed medical journals that talked about treatment of genderfluid with hormones.   It's possible some Trans people undergo hormone therapy who claim the label ""genderfluid"" but that's literally what a made up label is.

Yes, white people get called out for being racist whenever they dare to talk about race in a conversation or debate.    On the other hand, white people are the majority in America and there are privileges associated with being white.

TiADiscussion,3cxw7f,YarsAndTopol,-3,Mon Jul 13 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm implying that if their ancestors allowed themselves to be subjugated, they better direct their demands to THEM.  Well, you have to be naive to think that it's solely the black people's civil rights movement was responsible for the changes in the treatment of blacks - in fact, it was just a fraction of the solution. If the american whites - who were a majority and power - said NO, little would have changes. So in reality, the black civil rights movement should've owed it to the white establishment that it was taken seriously, and not kicked to the curb."

TiADiscussion,3cxw7f,YarsAndTopol,0,Mon Jul 13 05:43:06 2015 UTC,"Hrm, once again I reiterate - the black civil rights movement was largely allowed to exist by the white establishment, and it was endorsed by it. It didn't achieve its goals solely in an all-out power struggle.  Real class revolution, where people took what was theirs by force? The October Revolution in Russia. There you can't say they were allowed to revolt by the czarist governement. That was an actual clash and power re-balance.  Did something like that happen with the black civil rights movement, and I missed it?  And don't you dare tell me I'm somehow racist for speaking out about historic facts. You know which blacks did actively struggle? The Haitians. The countless independent African states, including South Africa, which overthrew colonial regimes. For better or for worse, they faced an opposition and revolted over it.  American blacks, who were let their rights through some gritted-teeth, condescending gesture of whites? No so much. So it's not black people in general at fault, but american black people's fault. They're going down the road their ancestors started, posing not as a strong equal, but a pouty demanding child, and that's why the actually get none of the respect they think they deserve."

Blacks were jailed, attacked, and killed for their nonviolent protest yet they didn't fight back and continued until they achieved equality. How is that perseverance and character less respectable than groups who use violence and tear down the system? The fact they won white allies makes it more respectable.

Presenting information to the contrary threatens their world view and sense of self, which freaks people out.

I might say ""The jews are the cause of societies downfall.""  The progressive might say ""Free Palestine! Death to the jews"".

It's saying women can't be held responsible for their actions. It's telling us we aren't capable of making our own decisions when we're intoxicated and that's so fucked up. Some of us want to drink and hook up with people. Why is that wrong? Now the guys we're trying to hook up with might decide not to just because they see stupid shit like this. I really, really hate this message. I don't get why it's not called out more from the woman's perspective. We're not just victims to be preyed on by men when we're drunk.

TiADiscussion,3cwgy2,booya666,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know the answer to your question, but I do know that the definition of rape in several jurisdictions in the US does, or did, include language about ""penetration.""  So you only technically tape someone in those jurisdictions if you penetrate them with something. In these jurisdictions then, it seems like this situation would've possible if having sex with a drunk person was having sex without their consent, since only the man would do any penetrating in the majority of situations.   That said, I think the idea that drunk sex is legally rape is largely a myth. Sex with someone who is incapacitated is rape, so if someone is so drunk that they are basically just lying there without awareness, then that's rape, but just having enough drinks to start making bad decisions is nothing like that. The problem here is that if you actually had two people in this state, they really couldn't have sex since they'd both just be lying there without awareness. So the situation where both are equally drunk but only one person was raped is pretty much impossible practically.   College campuses are big on cutting down on rape and sexual assault, and they aren't afraid to use scare tactics and bend the truth if it suits them. They also aren't really concerned with whether something is legal rape, they make their own rules and administer their own punishments. So while legally a situation like the one described in the poster seems practically impossible, I could easily see someone getting expelled from a school in such a situation. So perhaps it depends on who's defining it."

Rape law is not uniform, and varies from state to state. Older laws are based on penetration by penis, or performing intercourse.  Under either of these models a woman cannot be convicted of rape (unless she's trans).  I don't think any states still use the archaic ""Penis penetration"" laws, but I do believe quite a few still require you to perform intercourse in order to actually commit rape.  In a state that only requires you to commit a sexual act, or considers penetration by any body part, it's a more level playing field.  I should point out, the FBI has broadened it's classification of rape to be more inclusive since 2013.  As to why this poster is shit.  Drunk is a very broad term.  It starts .08 BAC, which is around two standard sized drinks, and goes all the way to passed out.  How drunk are both parties?  Is Jake just over the limit, and Josie is at the vomiting on her own shoes crying stage? Are the both really blitzed?  Are they both at .09 BAC and a third party reported it?  This poster is trying to paint a scary picture, and using the vaguest terms possible.  I actually doubt this is the work of an SJW or even legitimate activist, and more a scare tactic from admins trying to cut down on behaviour they don't want to deal with.  As well as giving them the ability to say they tried."

TiADiscussion,3cvjfe,ejlilley,6,Sat Jul 11 10:23:30 2015 UTC,"""As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.   Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard -- a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party -- an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed -- and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army -- row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.   Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.   In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!' and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.

Unless there's a plot about how this trans character is trans, they are not going to be noticeable as trans. I've met three trans people in my life, and in each case I had no clue until I was told.  A trans character in a film or show, that isn't about how they are trans is going to appear to the audience as non-trans in most cases I think. Its not like there's a neon sign or something to give them away, and somebody just going about their life, doing their best to pass as their preferred gender is not going to look remarkable in passing, they have in fact done their best to be unremarkable.  Plus trans people are rare enough that people don't think trans first when they see ambiguous gender, or other physical indicators. Stereotypes like butch lesbian, or tomboy, pop to mind far more readily than trans. So again, if its not called out as trans its not going to be obvious that's what the character is.   So at that point, any writer is going to be thinking ""Why bother making the character trans at all?""   I think that's why we typically only see the stereotypes, you'll either get a serious film about trans people and their issues, or the stereotype, or nothing at all, because being trans isn't remarkable in media unless the plot point is about being trans."

It may end up a travesty, which I really don't want.  I'd rather writers and video game producers or what have you stick to what they're good at, rather than massively fuck up what could very well be a great character. They could of course do some research and interact with trans people to actually get a feel of how trans people are, but even then, it's a difficult thing to do. For example, there was this comic I was reading, and one of the panels showed a desert, with the caption Dubai, Saudi Arabia.

TiADiscussion,3cmo51,TriangleDimes,3,Thu Jul 9 04:10:44 2015 UTC,"The thing you need to realize about Redpill is that it is just a general term; in its purest form it is counterculture and contrarian. That's how I've seen it used these days, anyway.  You will see people say shit like ""Redpill me in Hillary Clinton"" or ""Redpill me on the Jews"" and what they're asking for is ""what is the fringe opinion"" or ""what is the information I will never find in the mainstream media?"" Some of it is great, some of it is awful, a lot of it is conjecture. Much like Radical Feminists are a reaction to a perceived masculinity takeover in society, so the Redpills are a reaction to a perceived femininity takeover of society. They are essentially different sides of the same coin, as Radical Feminism can really be applied to anything. You could imagine someone saying ""Radfem me on ___"" and it would be a similar conversation as Redpill, except the other direction."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,bigdirtypissboner,3,Thu Jul 9 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"The irony of the whole thing is that this exact attitude is the product of buying into unrealistic portrayals of ""alpha males"" and some culturally constructed idea that the only way they can achieve self worth is through having sex with as many women as possible.    Keeping with the ""red pill/blue pill"" metaphor, their whole ethos is just as ""blue pill"" as all the stuff they spend so much time railing against."

It's not like there's some cosmic scoreboard keeping track of this stuff.  Just cause your brain is telling you to do it doesn't automatically make it good.  We're also biologically predisposed to fling our crap at each other, does that automatically make it ""good""?  I'm not trying to be pedantic here, it's just that they worship this ideal of the ""alpha male"" as dictated by other people and change everything about themselves to fit that mold because they believe it'll bring them pussy in droves.  All while bashing ""blue pill"" guys who bend over backwards to get every woman they meet to like them by being a doormat.  You don't see the irony there?  Sure, one might get laid more than the other, but at the end of the day they're still both slaves to some mythical ideal of women."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,not_his_nibs,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"I really hate this everyone should have to be themselves just because they are themselves line of thinking. On one side you're saying naturally inclinations are bad and on the other trying to fit a mold (which is an inaccurate way of describing altering unsuccessful habits, behaviors to attain a desired goal, if you play a sport, you learn to get the motions right to make the goal, you don't hang on to habits that work against it.).  What it means to be ""alpha"" is not simply socially dictated either. Active alpha is acting in a way that due to our nature aids in seeming dominant. Dominance is good because it means one gets more social capital and choice.  It doesn't mean it's bad either and it's certainly not simply socially constructed. Also we are not biologically predisposed to fling our crap at each other. It's not a drive like the most central imperative, procreation.  Nice guys think liking equals sex. It doesn't. The only irony is people doing something to get a goal which doesn't help. Wanting sex without emotional attachment is the opposite of bending over backwards. It's getting what one desires without the cost or comprise that makes relationships much more inefficient and costly.  TRP takes a more convulted approach, and adds too much drama, mythos and advocates stringing a girl along instead of just having sex and moving on to the deal imo, which is unnecessarily hurtful to said woman being lead on. It's also laced with unnecessary bitterness."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,bigdirtypissboner,5,Fri Jul 10 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"You're putting a whole lot of words in my mouth my friend.  I don't think we're having the same conversation.  And based on your last paragraph, I'm not entirely sure I understand what your point is either.  I don't really wanna argue how much of the red pill is true or not, cause honestly I really don't care.  I'm just gonna say that, in my experience, their theory misses a whooooole lot of nuance in human interaction.  There's a whole world of people out there who aren't constantly trying to play mind games and fuck each other over at every turn, and I don't think they understand how remarkably transparent they are to most people."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,not_his_nibs,0,Fri Jul 10 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't putting words just responding point by point; that it isn't socially constructive, that fucking alot and dominance is not a negative goal, that it isn't ironic per se and it's not being a slave to women like being ""blue pill"" is.  Agreed on the last part. Also to even just get laid alot, the mind games aren't necessary. My point is there is nothing wrong with someone trying to make themselves into someone ""alpha"" and fuck alot,  just TRP is a really odd way to do either. Most of the success comes from it's mildly more effective than being a push over, advocates weight lifting, and if you talk to more women you have a numerically better chance of at least some success. It's like if you don't work out at all, even a really ineffective routine will give results.  Male promiscuity and dominance not a silly socially constructed goals, and at the end of the day everything is equally pointless, we all die at the end so if someone wants to do it, no reason to make it into a negative. TRP though does it in a hurtful, inefficient manner, and misses the mark. We both agree TRP is bad, just why."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,bigdirtypissboner,2,Fri Jul 10 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"You are putting words in my mouth.  I never said fucking a lot or being dominant is a negative goal.  I'm not saying natural inclinations are bad.  I'm not even saying that what they do is bad.  I'm saying that society told them their self-worth is dictated by how many girls they have sex with, and the guys over at the red pill bought into it.  And if they wanna center their whole lives around getting laid, then more power to them.  But it's the whole ""we see the reality of the way the world is and everyone else who disagrees with us or doesn't spend all their free time trying to get laid is a blue pill beta chump"" mentality that gives me no qualms about making fun of them."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,Number357,4,Fri Jul 10 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"TRP teaches men to not only view women as inferior, but to view other men as inferior as well. Pretty far from an MRA mindset."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,not_his_nibs,-2,Fri Jul 10 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't even see the problem with putting up numbers, I get it's a backlash because sex that is physical, isn't intimacy based for guys that don't want the later are ""slut shamed"" now by many people who claim to be progressive. Emotionally empty sex is vilified for men now that it's being less for woman. Sex can be physical and not based on wanting to know, or liking the whole person.   Things like pick up artistry there isn't anything wrong there. It's how TRP wants to keep these women around, manipulate them into loyalty, it's like freindzoneing only with sex and using women who actually want a relationship, instead of finding ones that don't, because TRP hates women with high partner counts.   I also think being alpha is better than being not. People are too senstive and having had some awful periods in my life less whining and more stoicism helps to actually get shit done. So I'm an advocate of the whole traditional masculine values.  That being said, Redpill is oddly very submissive. If you hear how they speak about natural alphas with fear and awe it's borderline sexual, or how they endorse ""never outshine the master"", it's just really strange, I like evo-psych and have a fascination with fringe beliefs so I've lurked, read more about it then I should. It's just a very strange mindset. It's not tradional, it's reactionary."

They've got the same persecution complex, the same habit of dismissing opposing opinions immediately and the same fondness for getting worked up over petty bullshit (despite showing the opinion pieces of two different people that was accompanied by a 'discrimination' flair). Just as tumblr frames men/MRAs/whatever as a sort of bogeyman /r/mensrights has a habit of making feminists and SJWs as a bogeyman they've built up so much they can can blame anything on, I remember when the buzz about the male pill happened there was a reaction of 'feminists will hate this' because reasons.  They're just as dismissive of female problems and feminism as tumblr feminists are of male problems and MRAs. And while they've quick to make tired 'TRIGGERED' jokes when a piece of media makes a joke they deem to be offensive to or dismissive of men they snap to a tumblr level of outrage. They're convinced society is anti-man and convinced feminism is responsible. It's circlejerky, it's toxic, and like certain parts of tumblr it has become an echo chamber where rational thought and discussion is lost in a mass of bullshit and feels.  I also can't take a group seriously when they dismiss wage gap statistics because examining the entire male and female population is misleading before telling me that the US education and workplace death gaps are problems that should be dealt with...using statistics examining the entire female and male population as evidence."

I visited /r/GamerGhazi to see whether they gave me the heeby-jeebies like /r/KotakuInAction (the answer is yes). They literally had a post talking about how KiA would hate the new Mad Max movie because it had a strong woman.  They seriously bought into their ideology so much that they thought GamerGaters hate women. GG, for all its faults, fucking loves powerful female characters. There's a reason that Metroid game that portrayed Samus as less awesome (Other M was it?) was famously hated.  I saw similar things on KiA about Ghazi, and from MRAs about feminists (and vice versa, of course).  It's just bizarre. Why can't we just discuss the things that people actually say and do rather than inventing shortcomings for them?"

MRAs don't ""dismiss"" the wage gap, we believe that it can be accounted, for the most part, by women's and men's choices and should not be something that the government or private interests should seek to ""rectify""—which is in step with our general stance on equality of opportunity vs. outcome.

TiADiscussion,3cmo51,pineyfusion,6,Thu Jul 9 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"When it comes to the wage gap, I don't necessarily dismiss it, but I think that feminists are going about it all wrong. What they should be focusing on is the top if of value, namely the value that society places on jobs that are predominantly women compared to jobs that are predominantly men. Would you say that this is at the very least a viable discussion to have? Obviously, it's not a perfect one but I still feel as if it's one worth having.   I know there's other variables that come into play when it comes to the wage gap, but I do feel like there is some creedence to the idea that some jobs that are predominantly filled by women SHOULD be paid more than they are now. Not because they're women, mind you, but because they're jobs that are thankless are underappreciated. And maybe there's sexist undertones to that and maybe there isn't. But isn't it worth talking about at the very least?  I just wanted to get an MRA perspective on this. I consider myself a feminist but I have a distaste with the way feminism has been going these days and I feel like maybe if MRAs and Feminists had some honest conversations, maybe there wouldn't be such a hostility."

Problem with that is it goes off the rails quick, economically.  Engineers are worth more to the economy than daycare providers, and they are worth more for a reason.  Playing with that will introduce weird incentives that lower overall productivity.  Most likely, men are seeking these jobs because they are higher-paying and higher status.  If you want more male elementary school teachers, aside from handling the pedophile hysteria issue, you might try just flat out paying more.  It's also not clear yet how real/widespread hypergamy is.  If, say, 30% of women are just plain turned off by lower-earning/status men (and not just due to cultural brainwashing), then this whole plan is fucked anyway.  Also, men work a lot more hours.  You could also try pro-labor actions to enforce overtime properly."

People can get stupidly unreasonable with it, but I think if you use it like within their fields, then there may be something there. I mean obviously like you wouldn't pay a day care provider and an engineer the same. That's just silly. I was only trying to think of why exactly some of the jobs that are predominantly women are valued where they are and if they should be valued more or less. I think those are the debates that should be had. It won't solve the pay gap, but perhaps it'll bring some understanding one way or another.   I think the only thing that you can really do at this point in time is to just encourage women to make their own choices of going into STEM or taking less glamorous but higher paying jobs. If they choose to, that's great. If not, well that's their choice. Personally, I know I couldn't go into any STEM fields because I'm awful at math and physics. I wish I was because I'd go into those fields in a heartbeat.   Thanks for replying, by the way.

Women tend to gravitate, for whatever reason, towards jobs that have long term stability and that aren't generally required to constantly refresh/update/retrain skills. Those jobs tend to be kinds of jobs that any capable person could do with nominal training and experience, so they're not particularly well valued by society even if they're essential to that society's operation."

TiADiscussion,3cmo51,FireWankWithMe,0,Thu Jul 9 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"""Strawmanning"" seems to be a term people are very keen on using even when they're not 100% on the meaning of it. In this instance I'm not in any way strawmanning, I'm just stating my opinion of the /r/mensrights stance. Nothing you've said is news to me, and I'd still describe it as dismissing the idea the wage gap is an issue.  The stance you've just outlined is absolutely not in step with the MRA stance on equality of opportunity vs. outcome though. If it was then MRAs wouldn't consider the education gap or the workplace death gap to be issues because those can be just as easily explained by choices. I've yet to see an explanation of why the wage gap isn't a problem but the education and workplace death gaps are. The argument that the statistics can be accounted for by choices is missing the point though because when it comes to the wage gap feminism wants to explore and shift the context which leads to those choices being made, and presumably the mens rights movement does too when it comes to the education and workplace death gaps."
TiADiscussion,3cmo51,Eryemil,15,Thu Jul 9 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"You're wrong; in two ways. When MRAs mention those two subjects it is, primarily, to highlight the hypocrisy of the current status quo. Very few of us actually want 50% of firefighters, soldiers etc. to be female---because we understand that with the exception of some very rare outliers, women don't actually make good firefighters or miners or whatever. When we talk about male workplace deaths is not because we want more women to get killed at work; it's not even because we want to equalise the numbers of workers for fairness sake. It's because it is one data point of evidence of the suffering endured by men, even while certain groups whine about how hard it is to be a woman compared to men, in spite of all current and historical evidence. You know what our actual consensus for addressing male workplace deaths is? Better procedures, equipment and conditions in dangerous industries. Compare that to the feminist approach to improving women's poor performance, which almost without fail always involves giving women unfair advantages.  As to the current boy's crisis in education. Lets start with the fact that, even though females are doing better than boys they still get perks at every turn. It's NOT an even playing field; there is no equality of opportunity. Not even close. That alone demolishes that point of contention. But it doesn't stop there. Unlike what feminists claim, boys aren't just doing relatively worse---they aren't just looking bad because girls are catching up---they are regressing.   Women don't get paid as much as men because they don't deserve it and there is very little evidence that it has anything to do with institutional forces.   On the other hand, boys and young men are failing to thrive and the reasons why are in every college scholarship form, in the structure of our educational system, in the sex distribution of educators---I could go on."

But even bringing it up at all is hypocritical in itself because like the wage gap statistic it doesn't differentiate between different income levels, fields, or job types. Either statistics that examine the entire population rather than looking closer are bad or they're not, but right now /r/mensrights picks and chooses when they're appropriate.   Lets start with the fact that, even though females are doing better than boys they still get perks at every turn. It's NOT a playing field; there is no equality of opportunity. Not even close.    Can you outline some of the perks women and girls get? It sounds like there'll be quite the list if we're not even close to equality of opportunity.   in the structure of our educational system, in the sex distribution of educators---I could go on.

The fact that more men die at work than women is sad, but the reasons are obvious and no one is to blame. It's just an result of men exploiting a niche that women cannot compete in, or really have a need to. Desperate men that cannot do anything else work in the mines or oil rigs---women find a husband or clean toilets/wipe up old people's shit. The fact that women as a whole earn less than men, is also unfortunate (though not quite in the same level) but is also a result of women's choices and relative lack of need as well as the ability to exploit opportunities that men cannot that nonetheless leave them earning less.  I REALLY don't understand your point here. Yes, the wage gap exists. So what? It's no one's fault but women's, as far as we have evidence. Just like men dying at work is the result of men's choices. It is still unfortunate---both are. But you DO NOT try to address the issue through lying (claiming it is due to discrimination) or demanding unfair advantages. (that 40% of high level management should be legally mandated to be female, hiring freezes for men, school programs that divert resources to encourage women to become CS majors) Find a fair way to do it, such as the equivalent of strengthening work safety laws etc. and we won't care.   EDIT: Putting a stop to the constant whining about how terrible life is as a woman would help to. It's, at best, myopic and self-centred. You know another gap MRAs often talk about? The empathy gap.   Can you outline some of the perks women and girls get? It sounds like there'll be quite the list if we're not even close to equality of opportunity.   Scholarships, government and corporate programs, restructuring of the education system to favour their learning needs etc.   How can you not say the same thing about the structure of our workplaces and the sex distribution of employers?   There's evidence for one and not the other? Starting from the fact that female teachers are biased against boys and in favour of girls, corroborated by other research that shows that women have greater in-group bias than men makes for a compelling if minor part of the argument.   But this, by itself is only a minor point. Time and time again it's been shown that once you account for enough factors the wage gap virtually disappears."

They just use the excuse ""feminists would be mad if the genders were reversed, so we should get mad too."" It seems like it's gotten worse over time as well. When I first started reading over there I hardly ever saw petty shit, but now it seems like that's most of it, that or bad things feminists did. I've gotten mixed results when I've said as much over there.  Also I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that last paragraph, but I think I agree. You can't on the one hand say the wage gap isn't a problem because it's due to personal choices, and on the other say that workplace deaths are a problem. Either society is pushing men into dangerous jobs that pay more, and women into lower paying safe jobs, and that's a problem, or it's not, and they're choosing on their own, and it's not a problem."

But sometimes too much anger and grief builds inside this community, especially from people who were victims of the system (divorced fathers or painted as rapists).

But I feel like this is an issue with the reddit MRA subreddit, and not the MRM. There's a certain number of subscribers I think you hit when its inevitable the sub will become an echo chamber. The way reddit works as a system kind of forces you into that box as soon as enough people are around to downvote your opinion, rather than leaving an opposing comment.   As for divorced fathers, or wrongfully accused, I can't really blame them. It's probably the only ""safe space"" they can go to express themselves without self policing. If you have ever read into real life male support groups, a lot of it is blowing off steam, and some of the conversation can get aggressive. It kind of reminds me of the lesbian woman who posed as a man for a few months in 2006 and almost went crazy because of it, here's what she had to say about a mens therapy group she participated in.

That said, she did come out of the experience with a lot more empathy for men. She is still a feminist and sees it in terms of ""patriarchy backfiring"" to some extent, but she went in expecting that men would have it all compared to women, and came out with a much more nuanced understanding, which is cool."

I mean I've been seeing stuff like ""nobody complains about lack of women doing physical demanding jobs"" which I guess is true yet at the same time ""Women shouldn't complain about not being able do x job because they're simply not strong enough"".

TRPs are not a more extreme version of MRAs because they are totally different things.   One is a political movement, the other is a life philosophy. It's like saying that there are liberals and extreme liberals are ""vegans"". It's just a different thing.

Thesee type of places really do believe that women should not have agency in many cases, especially when ""mating"" is concerned. Men's rights though seems better but still fosters some degree of bitterness towards women as a group. It's better but I think it suffers from the same type of ""if others gain rights I lose rights and vice versa"" mentality. It also seems to atttact dolivorcees getting fucked over by the system and while I understand the anger they have, it is just one of those things where too much negativity can pool together and feed off itself.

TiADiscussion,3cmo51,Billlington,3,Thu Jul 9 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with MRAs is they have a lot of the behaviors they complain about in feminism. For example, ""western women are the most spoiled, privileged group on earth and have no valid issues"" seems just as common of a viewpoint there as ""men are the most spoiled, privileged group on earth and have no valid issues"" is in feminism. That attitude really hits me hard as a trans man when I try to articulate the things I experienced and hated about being female. A lot of the times when people bring up disadvantages of being female in MRA-heavy spaces, they're unfortunately dismissed as spoiled brats with no real problems. I especially hate it when that Self-Made Man book is brought up - holy shit, a woman who identifies as female prefers being treated as female instead of male? Ya don't say! That doesn't mean being a woman has no disadvantages at all, and said disadvantages are absolutely glaring when you never wanted to be a woman in the first place.  And the few times female-specific problems do come up, I've seen people try and explain why they're actually men's problems, or justify them using stereotypes.  However, I think men's issues definitely need a lot more attention. I prefer to stick to egalitarianism though, because while MRAs are better than tumblr feminists from what I've seen they both tend towards ""my gender is more oppressed than yours"" and negative stereotyping of the other gender for my tastes.

The Red Pill was nothing like I expected, and not in a good way.

Trans men get much less media and popular attention than trans women. Hostile depictions of trans women often portray them as fetishists and sexual predators, and as men who ""cut off their dick."" Not to mention the massive industry selling exploitative pornography featuring trans women. These hypersexual associations make the suggestion that a child is a trans girl instant clickbait.  Trans men treated like sub-eunuchs; not sexual, not predatory, just kind of pathetic. A female child's desire to wear clothes designed for boys is not treated as a fetish or sign of sexual perversion the way a male child's desire to wear clothes designed for girls often is.

In fact, they complain when others complain about tone; SJWiki actually has an article on ""tone policing"", which is a tactic used by anti-SJWs complaining about the anger of the SJWs. The SJW attitude on such tone policing is one of even more anger, because to them, anger is always righteous in the hands of a SJW, and a POC SJW especially. According to them, when they're angry about something, you're supposed to listen and understand what made them angry, instead of bitching about it. You're supposed to submit to them like a good little Student of Social Justice(TM) and vow to never ""step on their toe"" again (their favorite analogy with the tone/anger argument is ""I have every right to shout and get angry at you if you step on my toe and refuse to get off"", with stepping on one's toe referring to any microaggression that you do not properly apologize and repent for).

We need to be careful with that just as much as tumblr should. Anyway, if you want the short version, here's the definition from the video:   Politically far-left. Interested mainly in identity politics and what groups or collectives one belongs to. Low integrative complexity.   If you've never heard of integrative complexity before, that's okay. I hadn't before watching this video either, but I think it's an interesting if somewhat abstract metric to consider. Basically, your level of integrative complexity is your willingness to be open to other ideas that you may not agree with or be aware of. Large swaths of the internet are notorious for having low integrative complexity, and while tumblr is a prime offender it would be dishonest to say reddit doesn't have its own issues with this too. Also, having high integrative complexity doesn't mean you have no opinions and are completely spineless when it comes to your ideology.

It either has a ridiculously long definition that has not and will never be used correctly, or a ridiculously broad definition that could apply to anyone with strong liberal views.

How do you know if someone is ""willing to use authoritarian methods such as silencing and shaming to get their way"", without directly asking them, or searching through their online history?   As for me, I tend to look for patterns of behavior, so I do indeed search through their online history to see if there's a pattern. But the more common way to tell is by reading between the lines of what that person says. If the person in question wants a certain type of speech to not be allowed in an atmosphere that is supposed to have a lot of freedom of speech, such as a college campus, then I can reasonably conclude that the person lacks respect for the freedom of speech, because they are willing to violate it in that instance, and that they are willing to silence and shame anyone who dissents, because they want to disallow a certain viewpoint to be expressed (silencing) and will excoriate it (shaming) if it happens. If the person says that we should not use the presumption of innocence in rape trials, then that is lack of respect of the rule of law, because they are willing to violate it in that instance.   Should a few examples be generalised to characterise a person's personality? And finally, what good does it serve to have hyperbole in a definition (""gets offended for everyone and everything""- come on)?   Another reason why I search through a person's online history is because if it is just an isolated incident, then I give him benefit of the doubt, and so that I don't fall for the fundamental attribution error. But if there's a repeated pattern, then there's pretty good chance that it is part of a person's personality. As for gets offended for everyone and everything, of course that is a hyperbole, but they certainly get offended at much, much more than a typical person would, to the point that if you say anything that is controversial in the least to them, it is likely that they will get offended.   SJW is a silly term. It is a simple way of dismissing the views of another person entirely. It turns a person considered enemy into a raving lunatic, when in reality they are a person with families, friends, and pet cats. They may have weird, ridiculous views that you hate, but they are people. Be nice, listen, talk politely, and everything will be fine.   It certainly can be used to dismiss someone's views entirely. But just because they are a person doesn't mean I should accord their argument the same respect as if someone were to argue with more facts than feeling and subjective opinion. The term SJW just means ""your arguments are batshit insane and are not worthy of consideration"".  And as for ""be nice, listen, talk politely..."", that's exactly what a SJW doesn't do. They wouldn't be SJWs if they did, and it is unfair for you to insist that one side be polite while the other side gets to spew whatever bullshit they want. In fact, that is exactly the SJW playbook: when a PoC is talking, you listen. Anything other than complete submission, complete niceness, and politeness to them, any skepticism at all, means that you're an unrepentant bigot. On the contrary, the SJWs themselves, and PoC SJWs especially, get to be angry, because they are the ones ""facing all the oppression"" and so have a right to be angry at someone who is oppressing them."
TiADiscussion,3cnlo8,BinJLG,11,Thu Jul 9 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"Tumblr is a hive mind, for the most part.  Lets take, for example, Xkit Guy, the dude who made patches for the websites ""broken"" features. Everyone loved him. Then, someone insinuated that he was creepy to them, but refused to provide evidence or come off anon. No one else came forward with any similar stories, but that tiny anon rumour spread like wildfire and they ran him offline.   Fast forward a couple of months and Tumblr has updated again, and everyone's yelling ""where is xkit guy??? help us xkit guy!!!!"" comepletely forgetting that they had driven him offline with their baseless hatred.   And when they were reminded of it? ""I don't think so, I don't remember that, It wasn't my doing, It must have been those others, well was he creepy"" etc, just a bunch of delusional blame shifting."

TiADiscussion,3cnlo8,Diablo3RuinedMe,9,Thu Jul 9 08:52:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's Princess Syndrome mixed with rage addiction.   Tumblr users tend to be middle to upper middle class girls in their teens and 20's. They've grown up with too much of everything, especially praise. They've been told from day one that they're perfect little princesses, not just in their home but by the school system and the media as well.   It gives them an enormously over inflated ego, and it also makes them not want to try: they believe everything should be handed to them, and thus far, it has been.   It also makes them bored.   Thats where the rage addiction comes in.   It takes them away from their boredom to constantly be angry about something, it doesn't matter what it is. They don't care what they're mad at, as long as they're angry and can pretend they're doing something. When it's over, they forget about it, like any other junkie.   However, the princess syndrome insures that they can't just be mad, they have to feel like they've won. Which is why feminism is still so big on tumblr: its a neverending source of rage. If they won, they'd forget about it."

TiADiscussion,3cky8p,Cartesian_Duelist,7,Wed Jul 8 23:21:38 2015 UTC,"I had inklings of what SJWs were after the Daniel Tosh incident in 2012, where they kept insisting that he endorses rape because of what he said while doing a stand-up act to silence a heckler, and that's where I first heard about the 1-in-4 rape statistic and how women are supposedly in constant fear of rape, anywhere, anytime. I didn't quite know they were SJWs back then; I just considered them annoying idiots that didn't know what a joke was and didn't know how actual women acted.  In 2013, there was the Trayvon Martin decision. I honestly did not have a problem with the verdict given how unclear everything was, but hoped that Zimmerman would get his comeuppance sometime later, as I didn't find him sympathetic. Evidently, many of my FB friends disagreed. A guilty verdict was the only thing they could accept, and anything else was a grave injustice to all Americans and blacks in particular. I still didn't know of the term SJW though.  It was in 2014 that I really got familiar with the term ""SJW"". Ironically, it wasn't Gamergate that did it for me, but Ferguson. It was those who defended the rioting, using MLK's quote ""a riot is the voice of the unheard"", claiming that there needs to be a revolution, or those who were quick to call anyone who had doubts about the decision a racist, where I really saw how bad this was. This was the first time where I was hounded for being ""privileged"" (I'm not even white!) and saw all the SJW arguments on race in their full glory: black people can't be racist, racism requires institutional power, and that being poor has nothing to do with it. I was told to ""educate myself"" and told that treating people without regard to race was racist. I was told to stop speaking for black America when I said that I sympathized with what they're going through and that I had no problems with the protests, but I couldn't support the riots. It was then that I began to see how much they are similar to the right-wing Christians; they are equally a cult, with their equally strict rules that don't make sense to anyone outside the group, with shaming tactics used against anyone who disagree, and had their own version of what is considered proper, pure, and morally correct.  I then thought back to the various rape/sexual assault incidents that were in the news and how people reacted them, always believed the accuser, wanted lower burdens of proof, and claimed that trials in which there was rigorous cross-examination were traumatizing because ""no one would ever want to falsely accuse given the amount of harassment that they would get"" (they like to use the 2-8% false accusation rate statistic to say that virtually everyone who accuses has been raped). They cheered when 4 accused rapists at my school were proven guilty, and then bemoaned the appeals process (which they enthusiastically support if it's any crime except rape) when a mistrial was declared and the trial had to happen all over again, which would ""subject the victim to even more harassment from the public and from the defense attorney"". I realized that they were the same people outraged over all of those topics, and I realized that there was a small but growing group of my classmates who had become SJWs in college, and that I would be in huge trouble if I went against them.  I then found SJWiki and took a hard look at their worldview; what I found was a blatant disregard for scientific fact, emphasis of feelings and individual experiences, and an inverted social status hierarchy where the most oppression points according to intersectionality wins and gets to do whatever they want.   2015 has been no better. What turned out to be a fair protest against one of my school's professors for making prejudiced remarks about Islam took a turn for the worse when those students refused to let her come back and debate the issue, for fear that it would make Muslim students feel unsafe. Then Baltimore happened, which was Ferguson all over again, then Charleston, then Tim Hunt. Interspersed within are endorsements of Bernie Sanders and how much better it would be if the US were to actually become a socialist country (not SJW by itself, but not surprised that they would love him). Associated with that, though, was economic SJW-ism, in which supporting any non-left-wing economic policy means you're an oppressive shitlord bent on exploiting the working class, and that those policies would not have the side effects that economists typically warn of (none of those economic SJWs have studied economics, which is why they think that). The outrage machine never ends now, save for Gay Marriage Day (6/26), and I've basically stopped browsing Facebook because of how much this has become."

At my school there are sorority girls, fraternity guys, STEM majors, actual minorities (they are the worst, typically), and poor people that are SJWs.  I'll give you an example of economic SJW-ism:  SJW: Let's raise taxes on the rich/corporations to 90+%! Nobody should profit or make more than (insert some amount here, typically in the millions)!  Sane person: Wouldn't that risk rich people and corporations fleeing-  SJW: You heartless, greedy bastard, you'd rather children starve out on the streets than for those evil corporations and rich people to give up some of their profits! You oppressive shitlord, check your goddamn class privilege!  There are fair and legitimate arguments for higher taxes, more union power, and even sometimes higher minimum wages, but it's the namecalling those who disagree with them that makes them a SJW on economics."

That's hardly confined to the SJW end of town; if I had a dollar for every time someone on the right called me a dirty name over economics I could feed a family of athletic teenagers for a week.   That's the point entirely. The economic SJWs are no better than the right-wingers who cry ""socialism"" at any suggestion of government intervention in the economy or at any tax increase. Everybody's been saying how SJWs are the mirror images of right-wing conservatives; this is an example. They namecall anyone who doesn't agree with them and say that they're a bunch of privileged, rich, greedy bastards who want to see children starve to death, in the name of social justice (in this case, economic equality)."

TiADiscussion,3cky8p,dovercliff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the SJWs I know concede that class exists. They just say that it's only part of the problem, because you can still get racially profiled or discriminated against even if you're a rich black/Hispanic person, while you won't be if you're a white poor person. They say that you can still get catcalled or threatened with rape as a rich woman. That's all true, though being rich makes all of this much less likely. The stereotype that SJWs don't acknowledge class issues comes from the fact that they don't emphasize it as much and there aren't many that focus on them, but like I said, there are some that do. Maybe you've never met any, but they are there and they are pretty horrible as well.  I actually know a few that specialize in being an economic SJW, and are typically the ones advocating for absurdly high taxes, absurdly high minimum wages, tariffs and other trade barriers, and advocate ""buying American"" or ""fair trade"". Though there are superficially sound arguments for each of these (which are debunked on a regular basis in /r/badeconomics; /r/badeconomics is essentially the TiA for hilariously bad economic arguments on Reddit, mostly found in cesspools such as /r/politics), those SJWs don't even bother to use them, and instead resort to namecalling and shaming their opponents as exploitative corporate shills, shitlords, and psychopaths who utterly lack empathy for their fellow human beings who are poor. They also have the habit of hating on economists and the study of economics in general; it's the same thing as ""science/logic is racist/sexist"" except with economics. One of them once told me that I was being ""brainwashed"" when I said I was an economics major; they say that studying economics just makes one heartless and indifferent to the suffering of the poor, because apparently economics teaches you to ""fetishize markets and profits above all else"" and the whole subject is just rationalizing greed.  Being true to their SJW selves, none of them have even taken an economics course, and instead get their views from SJW websites which idealize Scandinavia as some socialist paradise where everyone is happy while paying their exorbitant taxes and yet are still developed countries (the truth being that Scandinavia is still quite capitalistic, even if taxes are higher)."

It's either that or for some it's shock humour, because in some social circles that sort of joke referencing a backwards stereotype is somewhat shocking and unexpected, and becomes funny from that.   I do understand that jokes often are used to reinforce ideologies and there are definitely racist jokes that are ""pro-racism"" but I'd argue just as many ""racist"" jokes are anti-racism, and you can often tell the ideology behind the joke with how it's delivered and the actual content."

TiADiscussion,3cj4y2,NaGeL182,72,Wed Jul 8 09:00:49 2015 UTC,"Shaming attacks are, sadly, an effective method of controlling and suppressing opponents and their ideologies. You turn them into caricatures, present them in a very bad light, attribute them negative traits and similar.   Feminism uses a lot of shaming attacks against MRA to discredit the movement, nothing else. If you shift the public opinion to believe that the MRM is composed of misogynistic virgin neckbeards who harass women because they are friendzoned, who'd want to listen to their arguments?   Most of the arguments used against the MRM are fallacious. Some are basic shaming, as above, some other is concern trolling (""It'd be better for the MRM if you followed the feminism example, worked with them, listened to them""), the vague-attack-without-evidence (""I want to support the MRM, but I go check their sub and there's so much misogyny! Such a shame they are wasting a good movement!""), the mixing them up, on purpose, with PUA or other groups of the manosphere, the ""feminism is already taking care of men's issues"" attempt to discredit the necessity of the MRM and a long list.  The problem with shaming attacks is that, while you may convince neutrals that this is true (as you can see in plenty of places), some others will remain skeptical, decide to do some research by themselves...and suddenly they are discovering that they were lied to. No one likes that.  What is funny to witness is how the attacks on Gamergate are total clones of what they have been against the MRM. It's just following the same catalogue of shaming attacks. Reminds me of the anti-male shaming catalogue. A lot of the shaming attacks by those who try to break with the traditional gender roles are about...enforcing the traditional gender roles on men."

RoK is basically in the same category as SJW feminism, but people tend to see feminism as a good thing because historically feminists have accomplished positive things, and as a result are more likely to view the extremists as not part of the mainstream movement.

TiADiscussion,3cj4y2,uptotwentycharacters,54,Thu Jul 9 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'll present the other side of the coin since I almost got involved in IRL MRA meetings and found it to be so awful that I actual think it's reputation is an understatement.   Reasons I think they've earnt themselves a bad name   The same reason SJWs have - they're easily offended and quick to call 'problematic' along partisan lines. In MRA facebook groups and the subreddit (look on the new stream) there's a great deal of people who are offended on behalf of people who don't really need it.  They have a vocal minority, spurred by groupthink, that effectively has a false view of history. Again, this is a mirror of what they're poised against (think Horseshoe Theory). The 19th Century was brilliant for women because they weren't responsible for debts and they weren't actually beaten or raped.  They have the same views of science. It's pick and choose to support an agenda - sound familiar? A paper comes out saying men and women are different and men process problem solving differently - that's good science. Another paper comes out showing how embedded subconscious bias is - that's bad science. The conclusion comes first, the proof second.  A vocal minority essentially hate women et al. I don't mean that they met a women and frown at her, but I do mean that there's a lot of ""Women just want to fuck men over the marriage"" or ""Women don't want kindness in a man, they want and need to be treated badly and that's a choice the government should respect"". I've heard both of those verbatim and was quite shaken.  The current associate with The Red Pill and Return of the Kings. You'd be shocked to see how associated these movements are - every MRA I ever met thought 'Game' was important and that I should 'take the red pill'. Someone once described 'game' as the 'operational response to gynocentracism' with 'withdrawal as the tactical response and Men's Rights Activism as the Strategy Response'.    Before you jump on me for being 'unfair' (""the science on subconscious bias is bad!!11!!"") just question whether it's because you have compared their methods with those of SJWs and they come up authentically favourable or if it's just that you agree with their conclusions based on your own experience."
TiADiscussion,3cj4y2,dagbrown,22,Wed Jul 8 10:35:15 2015 UTC,"You have good points.  I think the MRAs have some good points too.  I'm not a member of the community (and I'll probably demonstrate that by what I'm about to say), but I certainly agree with the good points they make. Men should be treated equally to women in things like child custody and time off work when a child is born, for example.  I have no argument with that kind of reasoning at all.  It's just sensible.  I also believe that in a domestic-abuse situation, weaponry is the great equalizer.  A woman can stab a man just as dead if she has a knife, as he can stab her.  I also believe that it's just as possible for the woman to be an aggressor in a domestic-abuse situation as it is for a man to.  I count myself lucky that I've never been in a domestic abuse situation in either the aggressor or aggressee role, so fortunately that's all hypothetical for me.  I feel for anyone who is the victim of a domestic abuser though.  I fear that if I became a member of the MRA community, the good points they make might well be drowned out by the negative things you mentioned, though, and that would serve to alienate me, much like how /r/atheism is a fantastic way of chasing atheists away from visibly identifying as atheists.  Me, I've resorted to saying I'm not religious (if it ever comes up), just to avoid being associated with the Internet atheism community.  Then again, the MRA community is a granfalloon (thanks, Kurt, for that excellent word), much like /r/atheism is a granfalloon for atheists.  It's a bunch of people who think they're members of a community because they think they agree on some idea or other, but they're really just people who use the idea as a point of identification above all other things.  Some toxic people who hate women and happen to be loud and obnoxious about it can totally taint the community at large, especially for people outside the community who might only get a carefully-curated-by-people-wishing-to-slander-the-community view of things.  Which I'm pretty sure is what's happened to the men's rights community at large.  It is especially unfortunate, though, that many people have been caused to conflate the mens-rights community and the pick-up-artist community, which actually is actively misogynistic (and misandrist to boot, they just hate everyone it seems, especially themselves)."

I'm now at the stage where unless there's significant societal change I can't ever see myself getting married because it seems like such a bad deal for man - especially a masculine man.   The only reason I bother dating is because I have particular personal circumstances which make it a bit easier for me but when my friends complain about how hard it is to find what they want I typically council withdrawal because the odds are against them.   That all said and done, Men's Rights Activism is a decent response. It's profoundly toxic and it's association with the pick-up-'artist' community is far too close for it to be a coincidence - I've heard 'game' expounded by too many politically aligned young men to believe it's a conspiracy."

There's still lots of good and logical people running around there, but in the last year there's been a big surge of groupthink and taking offense at everything.  I certainly support some MRA issues, and think that there is a lot of fact and reasoning behind many of their arguments.  The reason I would never consider myself an MRA is because they're poised to become just as bad as feminists (it's just that Feminists are the establishment atm), and the subreddit is already headed in that direction.  How ""reverse gender"" type posts used to work is that they pointed out the hypocrisy of say making fun of men, but not being allowed to make fun of women within a given context/trope, but the hypocrisy was the focus.  What started to happen was that instead of trying to make it that both sexes were okay to poke fun at, it's started to lean towards ""we're gonna be offended by everything too"".  It's gone from ""we should have some dumb wife tropes too"" to ""we shouldn't have any dumb husband tropes"".    Don't get me wrong, there are still legit base issues there, but there are now a lot of rage frenzy type posts.  Yeah, certain news sites or what have you are super biased and generally bad, but foaming at the mouth just because they said something remotely related to women isn't doing anything but scaring away moderates.  I went looking into the MRA because of the outrageous claims and found that they were pretty much all unfounded.  I think though that recently they've started to acquire members that are the caricatures they were made out to be (the man baby ones, not the rape apologists).  My guess would be that it's from the MRA's anti feminism stance that they're starting to draw in some people that are all about being the victim, just from the other side of the fence.  However insofar as your initial assertion that they earned the bad name, they had the bad name pretty much from inception and long before I saw anything remotely like what they were slandered as."

I disagree with some of your points, mainly in 4 and 5 which is very subjective and in my opinion often due to their much more vocal opposition. (I have personally never had an MRA advertise red pill to me, and from my experience many MRA threads take pot shots at Red Pill to show they are not the ""bad ones"".) However, I have to completely agree with number one. It's the big thing that turned me off from being a MRA participant. Just look for a thread about circumcision and see what happens if you go against the circle jerk or appear to be neutral about the issue. At this point I wouldn't be surprised for them to go full feminist, slap a cruel sounding acronym on anyone ""pro circumcision"" and then run them out of the community. It seems like many MRA's are more often focused on trying to mimic modern victim feminism, rather than creating a space where individual male voices can come together to be heard. That sucks."

Shit like the Red Pill is a huge embarrassment and it doesn't help to sweep it under the rug and pretend they don't exist. Gamergate has the same issue with parts of it being worthwhile but other parts being embarrassing garbage. And whining that someone said something mean on twitter doesn't really make you look good, it makes you look as whiny and petty as a SJW getting offended because people have free speech.

You could even argue that the near entirety of the bad connotations associated with the MRM is due to these other male focused groups. So if they are truly 'expelled' you would think at least one function of the MRM would be to denounce these other groups that take away from their message.

I fail to see how a single popular MRA talking to people in TRP indicates that the movement in general has links to TRP, despite your insistence that she was ""courting"" them. You actually seem upset that she was talking to them in a polite manner. You know, having a conversation. Enough with the ""with us or against us"" nonsense.  Also, the stereotype of MRAs being associated with TRP existed long before the AMA one month ago and you know it. The fact that someone had to provide that evidence to you, yet you were making the same claims before it, somewhat weakens your case.  This isn't even a case of the way radfems get ""mistaken"" for regular feminists. This is a completely different group that generally doesn't pretend to associate with the MRM or vice versa. The confusion comes almost entirely from sources outside both groups. Yet you're very insistent that it's the fault of the MRM only, that any sympathy or empathy towards TRP is the same as active endorsement.

As there are more people who believe the latter than the former, they're a tempting pool of allies even if their vision of society isn't compatible with MRAs' views either.  Also, there are instances where feminists oppose MRA positions even though they have no impact on (or possibly a slight benefit to) women, and which they thus have no legitimate grounds for opposition other than for the sake of maintaining a monopoly of victim-status.

TiADiscussion,3cj4y2,JaronK,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"If you’ve heard of the manosphere, it may have been in the context of Elliot Rodger, the 22-year-old self-described ""supreme gentleman"" who on May 23, 2014, in Isla Vista, California, murdered six people. In a YouTube video he posted the day he stabbed to death three men in his apartment and opened fire on a sorority house at UC Santa Barbara, he declared the slaughter a ""Day of Retribution,"" revenge for the world’s failure to provide him ""the beautiful girlfriend I know I deserve."" Rodger was a student of several manosphere philosophies, but his most active connection was through a forum called PUAhate. Most of its members embrace MGTOWdom after trying and failing to adopt the ways of the pickup artists hence the ""hate""at which point their bitterness brings the angriest of them to the politics of Elam.   Oh look, an attempt to link Rodger to MRAs. What a shock. Thank goodness for the complete lack of sources or references on this claim, or I might think the writer was full of crap.   Some of A Voice for Men’s biggest web traffic days followed Rodger’s murder spree. The media attention surrounding the Isla Vista shootings was a twofold gift for the group, driving new recruits to the movement and allowing A Voice for Men to present itself as the moderate middle.    Except for the part where the increased traffic came entirely from social justice folks and some of the mainstream press incorrectly saying Rodger was an MRA. Rodger wasn't some sort of extremist MRA, as the article implies, he wasn't one, period. Weird how Jeff missed that.   Some men tried to distance themselves from Rodger with a hashtag, #notallmen. Many more womena million within daysresponded with #yesallwomen, as in, yes, all women have experienced variations of the misogyny that led Rodger to his crimes.    That is a spectacular confusion of cause and effect. The hashtag #notAllMen, IIRC, had already existed for some time, and was revitalized in response to #YesAllWomen. Which itself was in response to Rodger killing and injuring more men than women, which was conveniently omitted from the narrative.   The manosphere did not like this. ""Men are your benefactors, your protectors, and your providers,"" a writer at A Voice for Men explained. ""So the next time you trend a hashtag about us, maybe you say ’thank you’ instead.""   Wait, let me quote more of the context. I've highlighted the omitted bit.   Making this about gender is even more ridiculous. Four of the six people killed were men. Nobody would tolerate it if white people went around demonizing black people whenever an act of black on white crime occurred, and pinning this on an entire gender is even more despicable than that. Men are your benefactors, your protectors, and your providers, we are quite literally dying to please you. So the next time you trend a hashtag about us, maybe you say “thank you” instead.   Weird. It's almost as if they were cherry-picking things because of bias, even though the GQ article specifically mentions MRAs complaining about being cherry-picked by journalists in the very next paragraph.   Leaving aside the sheer amount of wrong packed into that one paragraph....   To wit: Elam’s proposal to make October ""Bash a Violent Bitch Month,"" in which men should take the women who abuse them ""by the hair and smack their face against the wall till the smugness of beating on someone because you know they won’t fight back drains from their nose with a few million red corpuscles.""   A statement which the original article clearly said wasn't sincere, and was satirizing Jezebel responding to a report about F>M domestic violence be treating it as empowering for women. The article was later edited to make the satire even clearer, so GQ has even less of an excuse before limply going ""well, Elam said it was a satire"" as if it's an excuse made later., as if people aren't subject to being biased towards first impressions.  And most tellingly, there's no connection made between The Red Pill as a movement and the red pill as a metaphor. And one which has been a pop-culture meme for over fifteen years.   The manosphere consists of several different groups whose only real commonality is that they're primarily concerned with men. Going to one MRA conference run by AVFM isn't representative of the entire 'sphere any more than going to /r/trees is representative of Reddit.  Is this all you've got? Because it's weak sauce. In Wikipedia-speak, try for primary sources next time if you're claiming there's a connection."

My feeling is that it's better to discuss this by speaking out against the minority of people trying to use legitimate structural oppression of women as a way of furthering their own agenda.

TiADiscussion,3cj4y2,lifeonthegrid,3,Wed Jul 8 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"NeuroticIntrovert has a brilliant post on this subject  ""I think the most fundamental disagreement between feminists and MRAs tends to be on a definition of the word ""power"". Reframe ""power"" as ""control over one's life"" rather than ""control over institutions, politics, the direction of society"", and the framework changes.  Now that second kind of power is important and meaningful, but it's not the kind of power most men want, nor is it the kind of power most men have. I don't even think it's the kind of power most women want, but I'll let them speak for themselves.  Historically, that second kind of power was held by a small group of people at the top, and they were all men. Currently, they're mostly men. Still, there's a difference between ""men have the power"" and ""the people who have the power are men"". It's an important distinction to make, because power held by men is not necessarily power used for men.  If you use the first definition of power, ""control over one's life"", the framework changes. Historically, neither men nor women had much control over their lives. They were both confined by gender roles, they both performed and were subject to gender policing.  Currently, in Western societies, women are much more free from their gender roles than men are. They have this movement called feminism, that has substantial institutional power, that fights the gender policing of women. However, when it does this, it often performs gender policing against men.  So we have men who become aware that they've been subject to a traditional gender role, and that that's not fair - they become ""gender literate"", so to speak. They reject that traditional system, and those traditional messages, that are still so prevalent in mainstream society. They seek out alternatives.  Generally, the first thing they find is feminism - it's big, it's in academic institutions, there's posters on the street, commercials on TV. Men who reject gender, and feel powerful, but don't feel oppressed, tend not to have a problem with feminism.  For others, it's not a safe landing. Men who reject gender, but feel powerless, and oppressed - men who have had struggles in their lives because of their gender role - find feminism. They then become very aware of women's experience of powerlessness, but aren't allowed to articulate their own powerlessness. When they do, they tend to be shamed - you're derailing, you're mansplaining, you're privileged, this is a space for women to be heard, so speaking makes you the oppressor.  They're told if you want a space to talk, to examine your gender role without being shamed or dictated to, go back to mainstream society. You see, men have all the power there, you've got plenty of places to speak there.  Men do have places to speak in mainstream society - so long as they continue to perform masculinity. So these men who get this treatment from feminism, and are told the patriarchy will let them speak, find themselves thinking ""But I just came from there! It's terrible! Sure, I can speak, but not about my suffering, feelings, or struggles.""  So they go and try to make their own space. That's what feminists told them to do.  But, as we're seeing at the University of Toronto, when the Canadian Association for Equality tries to have that conversation, feminist protestors come in and render the space unsafe. I was at their event in April - it was like being under siege, then ~15 minutes in, the fire alarm goes off. Warren Farrell, in November, got similar treatment, and he's the most empathetic, feminist-friendly person you'll find who's talking about men's issues.  You might say these are radicals who have no power, but they've been endorsed by the local chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (funded by the union dues of public employees), the University of Toronto Students Union (funded by the tuition fees of UofT students), the Ontario Public Interest Research Group (funded by the tuition fees of UofT students), and the Canadian Federation of Students (funded by the tuition fees of Canadian postsecondary students).  You might say these people don't represent mainstream feminism, but mainstream feminist sites like Jezebel and Manboobz are attacking the speakers, attacking the attendees, and - sometimes blatantly, sometimes tacitly - endorsing the protestors.  You might say these protestors don't want to silence these men, but a victory for them is CAFE being disallowed from holding these events.  So our man from before rejects the patriarchy, then he leaves feminism because he was told to, then he tries to build his own space, and powerful feminists attack it and try to shut it down, and we all sit here and wonder why he might become anti-feminist."""

There was one article I read about a bunch of young Asian women who return to China/Korea because they disagree with being adopted into the U.S. so much. They were arguing that even though their mothers were poor, young, unable to care for them, sick, whatever, being kept by them would have been better because at least they could grow up in their culture. It was quite sad. These women don't seem to realize that had their birth mothers kept them, they never would have had the education to learn about things like ""cultural appropriation"" or certainly the money to be able to travel to another country.  Being familiar with the domestic adoption system in Canada at least (my parents tried to adopt), I know public Children's Aid agencies do try to place children with adoptive parents of their own race. This isn't a new thing though, it's been like this for at least 15 years. Cross-cultural adoption is not flat out banned but they'll only do it if there is no possible family of the child's race. I have heard some stories about Native children being placed in white foster homes for years and years but then suddenly their band decides they want them back years later and there's no questioning that, they go back. The private adoption system is more flexible and I have seen kids placed with parents who are not of their race. The difference is with the public system it's free but people wait forever to adopt and typically it's mostly children with special needs or abuse histories, and people almost never get that perfect newborn baby they want. In the private system it's a quicker process, there are more babies, kids who don't have as many issues and the sort of teenage mother, unexpected pregnancy or parent with an illness or financial circumstances is more common, but you have to pay upwards of $10,000 to do it."

I am in a non typical 'relationship' if you can call it that so I wanted support because it's been difficult to deal with.   /r/polyamory recently managed to dispose of its SJW mods and is actually worthwhile now - you can post there as a straight cis man without being accused of just wanting a harem.    I could have been one of these people if I grew up with Tumblr considering what I've been and go through. I am so glad I only grew up with 4chan.    Me too, man. I never thought that's something I'd be thankful for, but 4chan helped me grow a thicker skin and not worry so much about what other people thought of me. Nobody's perfect, of course - sometimes people still get to me, just like they did to you. It sounds terrible and cynical, but often the people you need to be most wary of are the ones who seem the most welcoming. They get you to open up to them and then they use it against you. It never gets easier, but what does get easier is dusting yourself off and moving on.  You'll be alright."

TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,Manakel93,31,Wed Jul 8 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"Your mistake was trying to play oppression olympics in the first place.  There's no winning with people who want to play that game.  If you play that game, whoever's most oppressed gets to speak and the other person must be silent.  Therefor, there is a strong imperative to win and not to listen to your opponent.  Bad game, all in all, and it never goes well.  For what it's worth, you can always pop over to /r/polyamory.  We're pretty welcoming there.  With that all said, let's talk about privilege for a moment, because the word you're using isn't the same as the one they're using, and unfortunately getting that wrong paints you as an outsider in some groups.  So let's make sure you at least know what they're saying... it'll help.  I'm assuming you're basically going with something like the dictionary definition, where it's about unearned benefits that someone gets, and it's usually a sum total (a person is privileged, or not privileged).  The social justice version of privilege doesn't work that way... you're not ""privileged or not privileged"".  You're privileged in some areas, and not in others.  Yes, you have white privilege and male privilege... and you don't have certain other ones (straight privilege, for example).  See, ""privilege"" in this context is ""the privilege of being seen as normal or default in society.""  It's a way of noticing that there are specific advantages to that.  You get them even if you're hurting in other ways.  A white guy who's homeless is pretty fucked up, and has some real problems to deal with, but he still has white privilege, which will help him compared to a black dude in the same position.  For you, white privilege helps you a bit where being black (but otherwise in exactly the same situation) hurts.  This doesn't invalidate the pain you feel or the hardships you've dealt with, but it's there, and it's a nice thing to have. So when you said you don't have privilege, that's wrong... you simply have a different set of privilege than this person leading the group.  Because privilege comes from being ""normal"" in a category, it's easy to miss when you have it... that's why you can so easily see the problems you have for having PTSD and being gay, but maybe you're not seeing the benefits of being white and male and such.  Here's an easy example: as a poly person, you have to out yourself as being poly when you date someone, and you have to have that talk with them where they figure out if that's okay.  As a mono person, you'd never have to do that... and most mono people would never even think of that.  With that said, she was using it wrong too.  ""Privilege"" is an empathy tool... you use it to understand when you have advantages you wouldn't otherwise see (such as not being followed around the store by racist security guards, or being slightly more likely to be hired for many professions due to being male).  It's not something you use to win arguments, because if used there it sounds like ""you're not allowed to speak because of your race/sex/gender/whatever"" and that's the opposite of the purpose... it's not a silencing tactic.  And that's what you felt when she did that.  You felt silenced and unheard, and you felt you had to justify your right to speak by stating ways in which you've been hurt.  That's not how it's supposed to work at all.  And of course, her slavery thing is completely stupid."

For instance, making it known in interviews/on applications that I'm gay I've gotten (highly competitive) opportunities that I might not otherwise have gotten.   Being a minority has been far more of a boon to me than a burden, even though I have been through some shit that straight people don't have to deal with."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,hyunhochang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"""Average"" being the key word here. We're talking about generalities and aggregates, not predestinated absolutes. White people, in general and on average, will have it better off than black people, in general and on average, in the United States. That said, it is possible that a white person could be worse off than a black person in the same situation or situations due to his or her skin color. It's even possible that a white person could go about his or her entire life being disadvantaged vis-a-vis a black person due to skin color. That's absolutely not the norm and we wouldn't expect it to happens often, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.  Another complexity is that privilege and power are contextual to what situation we are in. To take it to an extreme example, let's say that a black youth who looks like what society expects a thug to look like is put on trial for murdering a white woman. That black man will be disadvantaged due to both his race and gender in the criminal justice system, which is a clear example of privilege. However, in the fatal interaction between him and his victim, the black man was the one in power. Further, he likely benefited both from biology with superior strength and stature than the woman and society since he was more likely to have experience fighting.   Talking about races, genders, or other broad classes of people having power and privilege over others is a reductive abstraction. Sometimes looking at power and privilege that way is still useful, but we need to remember that life is a lot more complicated than convenient theories."

So it can't be that bad, it easy for you to get out your situation!"" do you not see the 15 levels of fucked up that is?   While I do feel a lot can be accomplished by trying to see things from others point of view, shaming people for some unseen privileged does nothing to foster understanding. By invalidating the struggles and hardships a person faces simply because of some nebulous ""privilege"" you feel they have. At this point it has been abused so much that most people shut down the moment it is mentioned. Not to mention that the kind of people who spout this crap almost always refuse to bring up class privlege, which is the one thing to rule us all. It doesn't matter what color or creed you are, you have money you win. So forgive me as someone who grew up very poor and who had to file for homeless aid at one point in her life, I find it hard to take the yelling and screaming of oppression from predominately upper middle class people seriously."

Instead of seeing a homeless man and feeling empathy and seeing that his lot in life is shit, people who spout this shit go, ""well he's white so it isn't as bad.""   That's not what it means at all.  He's homeless, and that's bad.  It's just an awareness that a black guy might have it tougher in that position too... which generally isn't a shot you take a homeless white guys.  The purpose isn't to say ""your disadvantages in life aren't so bad"".  It's not to invalidate your hardships.  It's to say ""here are some specific advantages and disadvantages you might not otherwise see.""  This is generally aimed at people in average positions.  So no, it's not fucked up, you're just not using the concept correctly there.  Furthermore, it's not about shaming at all.  The goal isn't for people to feel bad about privilege, it's to get them to recognize it so they can help share it with others if they can.  Everyone should have that privilege... not no one.  At the end of the day, white privilege isn't the problem... it's the fact that other ethnicities don't have it.  So no.  It's not yelling and screaming of oppression, nor is it invalidation.  If anything, used properly it should include things like ""economic privilege"", which is the set of advantages you get for growing up with the kind of economic advantages most people expect you'd have (like the ability to work just one job to keep food on the table, or the ability to have a car if you want one, or the ability to go to college instead of working, and similar)."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,TypoFaery,10,Wed Jul 8 04:43:33 2015 UTC,"But the problem is that is how it is used. It is predominantly used as a shaming tactic and as a tool to silence others, like the OP. And I am sorry you cannot sit there and tell me that even used in the most enlightened way it isn't meant to imply that you should feel a little bad for having these privileges. I mean when you use a loaded term like privilege you are going to cause people to become defensive.   Privilege has always been seen as something unearned, that you don't deserve. That somehow you have it easy. So when you go to someone who's life has been a giant pile of strife, adversity and pain and proceed to lecture them on how privileged they are you are coming off as a unfeeling asshole. And as altruistic as the original idea may have been, this is the monster it has become. It is now seen as a way to silence and shame others."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,JaronK,0,Wed Jul 8 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"You'll notice how I specifically talked about how using it as a silencing tool or shaming tactic is a misuse, one that even one of the people who coined the SJ term condemns.  That's how it's often used on people outside of SJ circles, because fools use the concept to argue.  But when it's used properly (which it often is, in normal non combative conversation), it works just fine.   And I am sorry you cannot sit there and tell me that even used in the most enlightened way it isn't meant to imply that you should feel a little bad for having these privileges. I mean when you use a loaded term like privilege you are going to cause people to become defensive.   It's literally in the definition that it's not about shaming or making people feel bad.  It's about making people feel empathy for the plight of others.  It's not ""you have privilege, now feel bad!""  It's ""you have these specific privileges, so you haven't had to deal with certain problems.  Make sure you're aware of those problems that others deal with, and maybe you can help them or at least understand their situation and perspective.""  But even then, it's not supposed to be some lecture.  It's part of a two way conversation.  Generally, when I talk about privilege, I use examples that I share with the person I talk to... both being white, for example.  And I use examples where neither of us have it... both being poly, for example.  It's not about talking down to people.  It's about talking with people with the purpose of creating more empathy.   Privilege has always been seen as something unearned, that you don't deserve.   Yes to the former, but ""deserve"" isn't quite the right word... it's neither deserved nor undeserved.  Privilege has always been something you got from the outset, but it's not necessarily underserved or wrong.  A child born into privilege was often seen as a very good thing.  Don't we all want that for our children?  And since we're talking about your benefits gained from your birth nature (race, sex, gender, etc), that applies just fine.  We don't ""deserve"" to be white exactly, and we certainly didn't earn it, but that doesn't make it a bad thing.  It simply is.  And it comes with certain societal benefits that we might not be aware of if we haven't lived without them.  That's all it means.  Now I absolutely acknowledged that the woman the OP describes is using the concept wrong, because you never use it in an argument, and certainly not to say that someone's not allowed to ask something.  Frankly nothing he asked about had anything to do with privilege.  But do you think a woman like that would be any less assholish if she hadn't fixated on ""privilege"" as the insult?  I mean for god's sake, she decided attaching information to something was slavery just because she was black.  Obviously she's just reaching for anything.  That's not the fault of the concept of privilege here, any more than her comments were the fault of the concept of anti-slavery activism.  She's just an asshole."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,TypoFaery,3,Wed Jul 8 05:57:39 2015 UTC,"As I said, the concepts behind the privilege debate are good and sound, the flaw has always been in the language used. Even if you feel that the word ""deserve"" is not the right word it is still how others interpret it. Think of any conversation, in any work of literature or film when the term privilege is used. There is always an underlying implication that it is undeserved. Especially in most Western countries. Things like ""work ethic"" and ""paying your dues"" are pretty common terms thrown around. Anyone who is seen as having not had to work hard or overcome adversity to get the things in their life is seen as weak, spoiled and privileged. All negative terms. So why in the world would that term be used to attempt to foster understanding and compassion in others when it has such a negative affilation."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,vvarden,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:12:15 2015 UTC,"Privilege theory can be misused, but that doesn't mean it should be completely dismissed. You can win the debate when you work within the existing framework of discussion; dismissing it outright won't win you over.   Instead of seeing a homeless man and feeling empathy and seeing that his lot in life is shit   Thing is, though - this is a statement influenced by privilege theory. And the most common type of privilege (one under-discussed, IMO) is wealth.   I'm gay, but come from a fairly comfortable position in life. Growing up sucked - especially with a pretty conservative religious family living in the Midwest. But now, I'm able to live on the West Coast, graduate from a good college, I've gotten to travel, and start a life doing what I want to do.  To many of my gay friends both here and back home, that's not an option. Many of them are stuck in shitty situations because financially they don't have the opportunity to do something different. I recognize that I've been pretty privileged (or blessed, in religious-speak) to have these opportunities. Doesn't mean I'm a worse person than them.  Wealth privilege is similar to sexual, race, gender privilege. As a gay man, there's a lot of shit I dealt with and still do deal with on a regular basis. And as much as I could try explaining it to you, you'll never fully understand what it's like. I can recognize that the same shit exists for people of other races and genders, too. I may not be black, but I get what it's like to feel disenfranchised. Being aware that there's a dynamic that I'll never truly understand is what privilege theory was created to explain.  Shaming people may not always foster understanding, but /u/JaronK wasn't shaming anyone. He was explaining that privilege can be an incredibly useful empathy tool. Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,TypoFaery,3,Wed Jul 8 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am too jaded on it and have run into too many people abusing it to ever feel comfortable with it. I see nothing wrong with having empathy for the struggles that others face due to things they cannot change. Everyone should understand that some people have issues and adversity due to how our society reacts to different outliers, but I honestly feel that the privilege debate has become so warped and twisted that it cannot be salvaged.   I am sure I am not the only person who has had a hard lot in life and then others come and brow beat them with talk of privilege. As I said, the concept may have been born from the most altruistic intentions but it is not how the majority of people are using it. You have universities using the concept of male privilege to silence male students in debates by saying they should allow others to speak first.  So you have to honestly ask yourself, if you are finding that you have to constantly explain away that no, it isn't meant to shame people and no it isn't meant to make you feel bad, that even universities are using it incorrectly, that perhaps the initial premise is flawed?   I honestly feel that the main culprit of this whole problem is the language used. As I said in response to /u/JaronK, privilege is a loaded term. Instead of using language such as empathy, understanding and compassion (which are terms that are meant to foster understanding of others) the term used was privilege. Which even before this whole mess has had negative connotations. It has always been a loaded term and for it to be used to foster empathy and understanding seems asinine to me. It, from the outset, comes off as accusatory and not expecting someone to get defensive and feel guilty when you accuse them (even in the most kind way) of having a privilege that others don't is niave."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,vvarden,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it sometimes does need to be used in an accusatory way. There are instances where people aren't empathizing and do need to realize why they aren't.  I remember last year around pride one of my fraternity brothers was upset there wasn't a ""straight pride parade"" or a ""white history month."" And it was like... dude, there's a reason those things don't need to exist. Privilege language was really the only way to get through that the dynamics are so completely different if you're in a minority group. It's changing now, but it's still not the same.  Having male students wait to speak on female-focused issues before women speak isn't silencing male students, it's asking them to wait their turn. In some of my classes dealing with women's and gay issues, there were a few straight white guys who wanted to have the first and last say on everything. Debates are good! But maybe let the people more impacted by the issues speak before interjecting with ""gay marriage shouldn't be legal"" or ""I don't rape, so it's not an issue.""  I sympathize with stuff like #notallmen and what you're saying, but dismissing the other side completely and assuming it will all be hunky-dory if we don't use the privilege language won't work out, I don't think."
TiADiscussion,3cgv0k,TypoFaery,3,Wed Jul 8 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"I see from your post you are assuming I am a man. Well, I'm not. Also if you need to shame someone into feeling empathy then there is a problem. Perhaps you should have talked to your frat brother about why he felt this way? Perhaps he was feeling shamed for his orientation? Perhaps he was feeling (no matter how unjustified) marginalized? Maybe someone had told him he was a bad person for being straight and white? You don't know because you didn't ask if perhaps it was coming from a place of shame and hurt? If you had talked to him about where these feelings were coming from you could have used the opportunity to show him that this is how many LGBT people feel and then expanded on how much larger and more oppressive it is. There are better ways rather than shame. ( oh and for the record, I'm bi too)   I really hate getting into slippery slope arguments but sometimes it has to be done. So here we go. While yes, people who have experience in a topic should be given a chance to speak first, but these proposals are not just in instances of minority or women's issues (and for the record framing rape as only a women's issue is sexist as hell). What if in that classroom that is discussing rape and sexual abuse there is a male victim in there? A lot of talk I have seen about this being enforced is framed as ""women are uncomfortable speaking up in classes so we should make it so they can participate easier.' Which on the surface seems reasonable but when does it stop? Why should a student be told to sit down and be silent because of their sex? The casual and quite frankly blatant dismissal of male issues is quite rampant and saying that not only do your issues not matter ( and make you a misogynist!) but now you aren't even allowed to speak.   Equality is not achieve by marginalizing others but by empowering people to speak. By encouraging people to empathize and relate to others. All this talk of silencing people and privilege does is divide people. I never said we should throw out the privilege argument, I said we need to change how we use it and the language we use. That you don't foster understanding by using derogatory language. Which it is. Privilege is often used as an insult.   Examples:  ""What the hell do you know! You are just some privileged little shit who has everything handed to you!""   ""Right, like you would know. Sorry but not all of us are privileged assholes like you""   See my point yet? Like I said the concepts and intention behind it are good, it is the language we use that I take issue with."

Regardless of any other factors, wealth gives an individual a distinct advantage in almost any situation one can think of.

I took some shots of the main weird ass mod talking about how the group isn't about equality or even for people interested in polyamory. There's a small cabal of us in the group who monitor their posts on a daily basis. At one point someone made a post about steam summer sales and how their dom in the group, Gabe,  had turned into a findom for everyone involved in the group.   Regardless I joined out of curiosity but that group is the most perverted form out there. Everything is twisted about and the mods and their Cadre of pals toss b&hammers left and right. If a mod so much as posts about ""their struggle"" it'll get a billion circle jerk comments.   I deal with ptsd every day and Tia, and lurking the discussions, has helped to put things a bit in perspective for me. That grpup is toxic and I wouldn't take anything there with any sort of weight. It'll just drag you further down. Unless you play their team and play it well, you'll get annihilated. There have been members in the group who actively sought out ex-members for the far as reasons. I won't name names and I won't go any further details though I believe that It should not exist, or at least the current mods should not be in control  There's a new side group that's called poly travel that's small right now but very accepting.

TiADiscussion,3chlqq,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:05:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have no idea why you're being downvoted because you are right on the money. One of the big psychological reasons yaoi is such a big thing is because teenage girls feel more empowered to explore their sexuality through a safe male avatar. Everything from first times to fetishes, it can all be experienced through a masculine/femine-but-still-male dichotomy in yaoi. I'm not even joking, there have been multiple papers published on this. In Japan women's sexualities are still repressed big time in terms of allowing women their own sexual agency, so yaoi is a big seller as a substitute, because it allows both the worship of masculinity from a straight female perspective and the worship of feminine ideals in the ""bottom"" character. With how female sexuality can be tamped down in the Western world as well, I can see why many women find yaoi to be a safe, relatable concept."

Have you read any of the academic stuff on this? It falls more in line with what I am saying. There is an element of young girls who find male sexuality to be ""scary"", mainly because, well, they're young girls and haven't really interacted a lot with regards to romance and the other gender, but a lot of it is just about exploring sexuality in a distanced manner. You do need to remember this stuff is all produced in Japan, where male sexuality is often portrayed as predatory in fiction regardless of if it is heterosexual or homosexual. Also, many ""tops"" in homosexual works are portrayed as sexual omnivores, the 'a hole is a hole' anecdote come to life.   I've heard it said often by gay men that the expression straight male sexuality is legitimately the most sexually repressed one there is, which people think is absurd when they see all of the T&A everywhere, but when males actually consume and enjoy it, they are derided as lechers.   Speaking as a bi person, I think both men and women who are straight end up having a weirdly repressed relationship with sexualized things. Guys are lechers, girls are sluts, etc."

So some people feel like it's OK to hate white straight men for being white straight and heterosexual. There's a loophole that helps them justify it and explain it away as OK and not bigotry but basically it goes with grassprivledge's post about the original sin. It's OK since they're not privileged and they're hating their oppressors. It's the same situation when someone who is bullied in highschool becomes an asshole later on in life to compensate.

Basically the more extreme your views are generally means you're a more extreme person who thinks in a more black & white fashion, so you're just more likely to enforce your views in extreme ways.  Sometimes different ideologies may reach similar conclusions about how to enforce their views, just the reasoning is different. The ""horseshoe"" theory is dumb because, for example, it's the same logic that gets people who are anti-Islam labeled ""right-wing"" even though their reasoning for opposing Islam may be because it conflicts with progressive views."

I'm a college political science teacher and my specialty is in public opinion. I, along with most political scientists, are not proponents of horseshoe theory. It's just not that popular. While most political scientists advocate analyzing behavior and how various measured opinions correlate to each other, with some very notable exceptions*, it's  ideologues that seemed more worried about charting people's political views. Most people are not that ideological. There are two main reasons for this: 1) they are apathetic about politics in general; 2) they are not sophisticated enough to be ideologically consistent. (Not everyone agrees on that second point. I do.) I'm not arguing that ideology doesn't really exist, or that it's not relevant or useful as a concept, or that's it's irrelevant. It's just not all there is. (I would argue it's less of a cause of things, and mostly something that is caused.)   My own little pet analogy for SJWs is Plinko. You know, that game on the Price is Right? (Incidentally I wanted to not that Bob Barker is awesome ). You drop a Pinko chip, and might go one of several different paths to get to its eventual destination. It might bounce far to the right, or the left, and it can potentially land all kinds of weird places.   This isn't to suggest that you should not reference horseshoe theory. I'm not that anal. It's just a pop-polisci term that's popular on here, and since it's referenced so much y'all should probably know some of this.   *If anyone wants some citations for what I'm saying here, I'll provide them."

(And yes I know this is America centric, but it is a pretty good example of the blowback that happens and how quickly it turns on the left.) at the end of the day the blowback from such bubbles bursting gave the world Reagan, Thatcher, etc. for better or for worse. The truth is the Bubble always bursts. It always will. More so with the extreme left SJW crowd.

Nixon ran on a platform appealing to the ""Silent Majority"" and he won two terms.

By '72, Nixon had actually improved the average American's situation quite a bit, and it wasn't until after the election that the scale of Watergate was really known.

TiADiscussion,3cbudk,Billlington,3,Wed Jul 8 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting time we live in, and I think it has a bearing on how this will play out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK, this is one of the first social movements of its time that's really swelled in the ""bubble"" era.  The online social-media landscape we have now is very efficient at creating circlejerks and hugboxes for even the most fringe of fringes. While SJW ranting isn't the most fringe thing in the world, it's certainly not mainstream, and the modern incarnation benefits a lot from the fact that indignant self-righteousness is a game that can be played at home, quietly, perhaps even anonymously, as you so choose. This, plus the fact that networks are global, gives an outsize reach that cements some degree of effectiveness, even for whackadoo positions.  The second element to the bubble, of course, are the walls. The most extreme walls are intentionally-segmented spaces, like ""locked"" groups, invite-only Facebook, or even self-isolation by Twitter blockbot. Walls needn't be solid, though-- lines on a map will suffice. If everyone can find their niche, nobody need leave it. Reddit is largely wide-open, but I needn't go to SRS, and I don't, and they needn't come to TiA, and they don't. Wall or border, we're all just frothing up our resonant-amplified wharrgarbl, and it's all too easy to forget the rest of the world exists.  So, place the start of a somewhat-fringe view into that environment. It's like a greenhouse-- perfectly suited for growth and protection. While I still feel like the backlash is going to hit pretty hard once this stuff breaks out into the cold harsh light of day-- It's silly, after all, as seen in how the 1990s blew overblown political-correctness' head off when it dared to stand up-- I think the contemporary social-media environment means that, in part, it doesn't actually need to break out as much.  And the other funny thing is that with isolation growing to be the norm, it becomes harder and harder to even know what the score is, much less predict the trajectory. Ironically, I'd say that if you ask a TiA'er and an SJW about the spread of fringe SJ ideology in a few years' time, both would probably overestimate it, while if you asked any other subculture, or cobbled together what tatters could be called a ""mainstream"", you'd end up with blank stares. Even the news-media isn't an equalizer any more-- along with the rise of social media came the fall of print and television media, and the viewership for those shattered into a mess of individual newshounds who slowly gravitated toward smaller-scale, highly-tailored news sources. Not only is it easier to think on an obsessive scale, it's getting harder to glean knowledge that's not on that scale. Even right now, I wouldn't trust myself or anyone else here to give an honest read of the popularity of these opinions in the world at large. We're all down in it, so everything looks distorted by proximity and anecdote.  Anyway, I suspect what you'll see is a tradeoff of effectiveness for tenacity, and a trailing taper more than a popping bubble. There won't be a revolution or even much of a lasting recognition, but it won't go away, either. Some reasonable bits will float up and be accepted, but the subset of people who care too much will still be in their own, winning and losing little insignificant battles for a long time to come-- no more, no less."

(And, yes, I'm being amerocentric, but that's regular practice for SJWs.)  Here are my reasons:   This is a bigger version of the atheism boom we saw about 5 years ago, which only had steam as long as it had resistance. Atheism activism died of lack of opposition (because, really, aside from some defunct laws, what oppression does an atheist face?), and solidification of stereotypes (chubby, white, acne, fedora, ""euphoric""). The former is still there for the SJ movement (in its latest incarnation), and the latter is starting to settle in (and Big Red is putting forth a respectable effort to be that stereotype). The burst of Atheism activism lasted... like... maybe 4 years? It slowly built up then quickly crumbled, and the SJ movement definitely had a nice slow buildup. It's breakdown time will depend on the resistance it feels in the next few years (hence the contingency of presidential affiliation). People are gonna start getting disillusioned because they're just fucking lazy. The apex of social justice activism would be a (neo-)Marxist revolution (see: radqueers), but when you walk the streets (in the US) do you see a Marxist uprising occurring anytime soon? People are fat n' happy. Dunno about you but the image of a bunch of 20 somethings with dyed hair, three too many facial piercings, and a gender identity that'll make your head spin doing an armed march on DC is farcical. What's more, do you see Marxism working in the US in our lifetimes at all (peacefully or otherwise)? I don't. There are millions of well-armed people far too set in their ways to allow that to happen. (And besides all that, Marxism is simply an unproven system, whereas restricted capitalism has shown itself to work quite well.)   As an aside, start putting your chips on the Ironic Misandrists™. If they do what they claim, then they're to SJ what Pastafarianism and 'Satainism' are to Atheism; highly effective, noisy, and (hopefully) hilarious activists (even if they aren't right now)."

I love Atheism as a philosophy and am fascinated (no condescension implied) by what it all means; living without the crutch of believing that actions get you heaven points and ""you just have to believe"" mentality; But Atheism as a political movement is, by its nature, contrarian to religion. Many conservative-minded people who would go on to chastise and demonize atheism see it as the opposition to what they grew up with: community, understanding, and love. And, if I may, it's difficult to imagine atheism talking about anything other than that they oppose religion (seen by many as a net good), which can rub people the wrong way.  I believe in separation in church and state (and if any Christian says  otherwise, read them Mark 12:17 ), love theistic debate that tests my beliefs, all that jazz.

The large majority of these classes that people are triggered in are required for either general education requirements (i.e. no matter what you're majoring in, you must take English 101 or whatever) or required classes to complete the major. Very few of these are in electives, otherwise they have an even flimsier excuse for why they're trying to avoid it than they already do.

TiADiscussion,3cd1j5,Sariel471,17,Mon Jul 6 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"Gender is different from gender identity. Gender identity is biological, it is an internal drive to want a male or female body whereas gender is a series of expected behaviors for each gender. There is a ton of scientific evidence for this:   What causes transgenderism?  It's been theorized that transgenderism is caused by social influences, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Scientific evidence does indicate that transgenderism is caused by a brain that is not properly masculinized or feminized due to a combination of genetic and pernatal hormone exposure factors. Let me list off some evidence for this:   ""They found significant differences between male and female brains in four regions of white matter – and the female-to-male transsexual people had white matter in these regions that resembled a male brain (Journal of Psychiatric Research, DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006). ""It's the first time it has been shown that the brains of female-to-male transsexual people are masculinised,"" Guillamon says.""  ""Surprisingly, in each transsexual person's brain the structure of the white matter in the four regions was halfway between that of the males and females""   In female to males (FtMs) these regions matched the brain regions of men and in male to females they are halfway between male and female. Not just that, these regions are believed to be related to body perception.   ""It connects the parietal lobe [involved in sensory processing] and frontal lobe [involved in planning movement] and may have implications in body perception.""   http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan.html#.VXj_v0aIUxJ  This study also found another brain structure that differs in transgender women:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289  This study also indicates that transgender people have different brains:  http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530%2815%2900030-X/abstract?cc=y=  Another research group made a graph to show these differences:  http://transascity.org/files/science/Brain2.jpg  Why would these differences in brain structure exist if they didn't cause gender dysphoria? This also shows that mentally, you can argue that transgender people were always the gender they identify as.  On top of that, trans women have less exposure to androgens, which are responsible for masculinization in the womb   Our findings support a biological etiology of male-to-female transsexualism, implicating decreased prenatal androgen exposure in MFT   http://www.psyneuen-journal.com/article/S0306-4530%2805%2900177-0/abstract  Also, studies of identical twins and fraternal twins are used to determine if something has a genetic component. Identical twins have exactly the same DNA and share the womb, and fraternal twins have different DNA and share the womb. They are used elsewhere to prove that things like bipolar disorder, autism, and personality all have a genetic component. In sets of identical twins that have at least one twin that has the studied condition have a higher rate of both having the same condition than fraternal twins, that proves that that condition is at least partly genetic.  And in twin studies of transgenderism, they prove just that.   ""More specifically, within this combined data pool there is a 33.33% concordance among monozygotic male twins compared with a 4.76% concordance among dizygotic male twins. In addition, there is a 28.38% concordance among monozygotic male and female twins compared to a 0.34% concordance among dizygotic male and female twins.""   So the concordance rate (rate of both twins having the condition) for transgenderism in male and female identical twins is 33% and 28.38% while the rate for male and female fraternal twins is 4.76% and .34%. That shows there is a large genetic component to transgenderism. So why are twin studies useful in studies of other conditions but not transgenderism?  http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html  For more reading on twin studies:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study   .   then is transgender when a man physically has a penis but mentally has a vagina?   Yes, a trans woman sometimes feels she should have a vagina, though some of these women don't wish to change.   A common dogma of feminism is that a woman doesn't have to be feminine to be a woman.   Where exactly in the transgender movement are they requiring trans women to act feminine? As far as I know, the transgender movement doesn't care how masculine or feminine a trans man or women acts. It just turns out that most trans men and women want to dress like their gender like practically every other man and woman. Is this really surprising? If you have a problem with this, why don't you go out into the street and try to convince everyone who walks by to cross-dress?"

TiADiscussion,3cd1j5,booya666,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"I think there's an important distinction to be made here. In the brain gender theory (what is argued above), your brain has a sense of whether you should be on team male or team female, and then you are more likely to adopt behaviors from that group. So, you look around and the people you identify with are wearing dresses, so you figure you should to. I think a lot of feminists feel threatened because they think that the claim is that stereotypical behaviors are somehow etched into the female or male brain. So your female brain makes you want to wear dresses because that desire is just programmed into women. That seems silly to me at least."

TiADiscussion,3cd1j5,BoredDead,14,Sun Jul 12 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"The other major change of transgendered men is aesthetic. The only real way they can pass as women is by wearing makeup and dresses, having effeminate voices, and getting boobs.  Without the cosmetic change all they are, are men with fucked up penises.   You obviously know very little about transgender people and yet you write this garbage.   After hormone therapy a trans man and woman doesn't have to do anything to pass. They truly have the body of the opposite sex. Biologically, this is about 90% true. The change from hormone therapy is far from only aesthetic. Let me explain:   Is transitioning even possible?  The transition that Caitlyn Jenner had involved many expensive surgeries. That was necessary because hormones would be less effective at her old age. However most trans people really only need an inexpensive medication to transition. This is called hormone therapy and it involves suppressing one sex hormone and replacing it with another, and it is as powerful as it sounds:  http://imgur.com/5tanp (female to male)  http://i.imgur.com/c6FNl.jpg (male to female)  http://i.imgur.com/UcNNs.jpg (male to female)  http://imgur.com/unxNSEH (male to female)  Saying it is biologically impossible to change sexes misrepresents the issue. A transgender man can not currently be 100% biologically male but saying a transgender man is 0% biologically male is highly inaccurate. There is incredible power in suppressing one sex hormone and replacing it with another. In the womb, hormones decide gender, not chromosomes (some people have XX chromosomes and are born male with male genitalia). If these hormones are responsible for gender inside the womb, can't they be considered to change gender outside of it?  The face, chest, voice, decreased libido, reduced muscle mass, and redistributed body fat of a trans woman are biologically female. The face, voice, increased libido, muscles, body hair, increased weight, and increased appetite a trans man have are biologically male. And of course a trans man and woman both look indistinguishable from other men and women. I would say a transgender person can have 85% of the things the opposite sex has, and none of the things they are missing should prevent them from being considered as the opposite sex. Just because someone can't reproduce doesn't mean we no longer define them as their gender anymore, so that standard is ridiculous when applied to transgender people.   Hormones are so powerful that a trans man can actually compete physically with other men in professional sports. Chris Mosier is a duathlon athlete who is going to compete in the 2016 men's world championship, and he was also born female.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mosier  This is utterly amazing, this means that a top level female athlete could undergo hormone therapy and there isn't any reason why (now a he) couldn't be a top level male athlete.   So the changes trans men and women undergo are far more than cosmetic."

You're free to read, but it's going to veer off topic.  You've correctly noticed a conflict within feminism on this. There are bitter bitter fights on corners of the internet about this between people who are fighting that their feminism is the real, considerate one. I have personally found the more vocal of gender-critical feminists as more obsessed with transgenderism than they are interested in the removal of gender roles (that supposedly underlies their interest in the subject of transgenderism).   Again, gender crtitical feminists have always come off really weird to me - like half the time I don't believe them when they say they think gender is purely social - a lot of them give off a weird female supremacy vibe to me - yeah, sure, men are all out to get you, and many people born as a man will change into womens clothes take hormones, and be treated like aliens by the rest of society, and it's all just to get you because they're angry entitled violent sadists who like to hurt women and can't stand how better and standing strong women born female are. Right.  But I'm not interested in writing about them specifically. They're a relatively fringe group so it makes more sense focusing on this ideological conflict as it is dealt with in the mainstream of feminism.  Most people advocating for feminism on the internet are going to bracket away this contradiction if you asked  Lots of SJWs would, despite their proud affiliation of themselves as having expertise on gender, not be able to respond to these problems with a coherent theory of gender.  I used to be a SRSer, and the one time this topic was brought up (not by me) the stock answer was ""gender is a new and evolving topic! we can't really know!""  Most of them actually simultaneously argue for (A) public education about transgender men and women having a scientific basis as being super duper important, and (B) practically zero biolgical personality differences  when responding to men discussing the subject (even comments pointing to cross-cultural analyses, etc will be dismissed as universally a ""biotroofs"" agenda - as if that if you cared about equaltiy, this is an area of scholarship that you'd understand we need keep at bay until society is equal, because the public can't handle nuance. In their mind the public is too ready to interpret anything to fit their preconceptions).  To a large extent they're right to be wary because so much of the rest of society is ready to assume biology when socialization could be a culprit - but their kneejerk dogmatic response means they are actually forced to resort to ridiculousness like ""who knows!"" or a popular comic in that crowd: what is the gender spectrum? a bunch of scribbles ""fuck off""  But here's the better of their ideological angels:  But the rare really bright among them, who have taken at least a course in civics at high school or college, frequently are capable of arguing a coherent theory of gender that makes room for these seeming contradictions. It goes like this:   Sexual dimorphism does extend to the brain, a large part of that is hormones, but there's plenty besides hormones. There's been respectable studies that have found a correlation between people who self-identify transgender and people who have unusually distinct brain features similar to the opposite sex. The sexually dimorphic personality traits can loom large enough in an individual person's life that transitioning to the opposite gender in public and personal life can be beneficial to them. But in aggregate, there's so much variety in sexual dimorphism - for example, individual observation skills charted by gender would be mostly overlapping distributions, with women's distribution shifted only slightly to the right (and same the other way for spatial analysis with men) - that on a social policy level, it is more practical to treat everyone as equal - to start from the presumption that differences are due to socialization.    (and the same for transgenderism, on a practical level the benefits of giving them the benefit of the doubt has greater social utility for the majority of people it would be relevant to)  But again, yes, taking away the convenient brackets does reveal a lot of loose ends  This actually ties up a lot of loose ends in regard to their political activism, but reveals a lot of loosed ends in regard to trying to punish private entities for not pressuring (in their mind enabling) the public to be more equal: e.g. trying to prevent sale of toys that signal that they are intended or more likely a good fit for a particular gender, establish affirmative action in well-paying industries where women make up a small proportion of the workforce. We can assume women and men are perfectly equal, but in cases where there actually are things women are less interested in doing than men (as has been brought up before, at any given moment in time, women in wealthier countries are actually more likely to make the choice (among jobs they are equally capable of doing as men) to pursue stereotypically feminine jobs even at lower pay)  Perhaps this is men and women ""indulging our gendered selves"" as one paper put it from gender roles. If we just use the right carrots and sticks to get women as 50% in hard sciences across the country for a couple generations we can fix this once and for all! We have to at least test and see, right, and then later let the chips fall where they may biologically - it may be a much lower difference than we think!  Well, maybe - but now we're reaching the limits of the ""social pragmatism with much benefit and low cost to treat everyone as equal."" I mean at first with higher incentives for women and special programs for women - which there are many already, you're going to see some wins of women entering the field - but those are probably the ones already teetering towards it anyway.   ""Society must always assume socialization first, ask questions later, at all costs"" just like ""must assume biology first"" often looks a lot like unsavory priorities in regard to inequality  The question becomes as a society not just ""how much are we willing to pay"" but ""is this the best method to improve women's welfare in their professional lives."" A much better cost-benefit (and a better one for economies overall) is public daycare so skilled women do not have to drop out of the workforce, even for just 3 or 4 years, and end up getting a lower position than their particular skills deserve. That is bad for women, and bad for the economy.  So I think erring towards assuming perfect equality, but not hanging onto the topic in either direction (nature! nurture!) once it becomes a toughie on this subject, the question becomes what is your priority - advancing women's welfare and equality in general as fast as possible, or seeing a few more middle upper class women bump up to upper class? Because ""having more women there will inspire other women"" trickle down feminism?  Compared to say, unprecedented unappetizing and questionably ethical legal ideas of institutionalized affirmative action for a particular industry in schools, public daycare is an easy to politically win for feminism (because of the economic benefit) and it brings about a lot of progress."

The Germans believed they were oppressed by Jewish people and were fighting against their oppressors.

Like, a nearby wealthy city to me  passed a law recently attempting to criminalize homelessness. I volunteer with a woman who runs a homeless shelter in my city and she was trying to expand into this rich city, but they denied her the permits. Pretty much just because they don't want to have to look at poor people.  A lot of people who make the most difference when it comes to charity are indeed wealthy (eg Bill Gates), but this is simply because they have the time and/or resources. My experiences tell me that the typical rich person is a bit more selfish than average, coupled with being completely out of touch wih what it's like to be a member of the working poor."

That said, I'm not sure that SJW-ness can drive people to insanity of that magnitude. A lot of people will disagree with me on this, but I believe that SJWs really are doing what they believe will help certain minorities. For a lot of SJWs, it drives them to the point of bigotry, but if they show their support and get the attention of their desired underdog, it's mission accomplished already. Solidarity -- however misguided -- is the goal. Vocally unifying against oppressors is just a bonus.   SJWs are idiots, not psychopaths.

Many rich and powerful people are selfish and ruthless in seeking more wealth and power, and like it or not that contributes to the inequality and injustice in the world.     I agree that people living in miserable conditions are more likely to do bad things.  That shows up in all the statistics and no one is denying that poverty and being a shitty person are highly correlated.  But what are the reasons for that poverty?  The social justice view is that poverty is mostly caused by oppression from the powerful, and that bad behavior by the impoverished is excused because their poverty is not their fault."

Living on 30k as a single person is pretty luxurious by American standards.     Being poor and receiving welfare... yeah, it's not really helping anyone but the governments, no?   My mom and I were on welfare when I was a kid.  She was a single mom, because my father was in prison (and he deserved to be there).  She had been working for an hourly wage before she had me, but there were no jobs that would let her afford child care and so she was unemployed and moved into government housing to take care of me.  We collected welfare until I was about 8, at which point I could stay home alone while she went to work.  My mom says the best thing she ever did was to raise me.  I think her attention early in my life had a lot to do with me being excellent in academics, I was a genius kid and I went on to get a PhD in theoretical physics and work at some of the top universities in the world.  I had a tough early life, we were very poor even with the welfare and other government assistance.  If that wasn't hard enough while growing up, I'm also a male-to-female transsexual!

Hopefully she could've found a job if she was denied or couldn't collect welfare. However, genius kids are one in thousands, where other welfare recipients are mostly abusing the system and don't bear any fruit.   So, the question is - does the economy need to suffer a burden of dozens of thousands leeches in hopes that one of them is a brilliant theoretical physicist?

Thus why poor whites were so vehemently anti-black.  Giving a rise to black voices definitely threatened their ability to be heard which was already very small.  However, that power dynamic does not exist anymore in the U.S. and SJWs have no understanding of how direct action does not have to mean physical violence."

Especially when the ""oppressed"" are not oppressed by any reasonable standard, and the oppressors aren't really oppressing.  Thing is, that we attach the concept of virtue to ""oppressed"" people, and shield them from critisism based on the fact that they might be disenfranchised in some ways. But virtue = ! oppressed status. Being a member of an oppressed group doesn't mean that the person is virtuos, or if they are, that the same quality is should be umbrella-ed all over the other members.  My favorite example of this, is South Africa and the Soviet Union in the 1920s. The so-called ""oppressed"" groups, after violently gaining power, made shit far worse for even THEMSELVES, than it was before.   LOL at the downvoters.

TiADiscussion,3c6ydo,BreakBricker,9,Sun Jul 5 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story - and I do think that you made a good effort in not turning into the eternal victim, but a thinking and sensible person instead.  You're actually completely correct on the way we treat people through the lens of humanization and dehumanization.  I can share a bit of my own story. I was a rather scrawny and small kid in my school. And at first, I was constantly confronted by MINORITY kids. We had quite a massive ethnic population in our town (and to be honest, a lot of these people were engaged in illegal and criminal activity), and being a member of a MAJORITY population, I still got bullied by them. Not for long tho, because I was an aggressive kid, and fight after fight earned the cred.  But later in life, it lead me to adopt a very intolerant view of the minorities. It even, to some degree, influenced my decision to enlist in the army as a chance to go into the countries where these people had originated, and ""put some order"" there. Which I did. But even after returning from the service, seeing how these people fucked their lives up, I held the same views. Racist to a degree, I'd have to admit. And during college, I proudly upheld these views, and on the internet as well, and was confronted by people, who in returned, dehumanized ME.  Fastforward a few years, where my journalist job forced me to abandon much of the political activism, because there was simply no time or sense left to it. I had made some work on myself, trying to adopt a more reasonable stance in society, to improve stuff in constructive ways rather than being a hateful bonehead - donating to charities, doing some community work, etc. At that time, I had posted in a personal blog that it's a civic duty to donate blood, and how I did on a scheduled basis, and half of the replies I got was ""well what does an imperialist murderer like you know about helping people"" and ""best you can do is go and kill yourself"".  That had driven me to the same conclusion as you did. People love their black and white thinking, their comic-book mindset of morality. They don't stop to think that hey, a racist could become a racist because he had faced violence and no recognition or justice for it himself. That a rapist might have been a victim of sexual abuse themselves. Not that it extricates such people from the consequences of their actions, but it doesn't automatically make them ""NOT people"" and evil incarnate. And that understanding the mechanisms of it, could help lessen the cycles that go on.  A lot of blame I'd actually put on the whole prison system. Prisons breed new criminals. They're not the places where people can reflect on their actions and correct their behavior, but ingrain it harder and actually break them into becoming WORSE. And when these damaged, mentally ill people are freed into the public, and go on to commit more crimes and deal more violence, we go ""told you! these people are beyond saving!"".  Noone is given a chance, basically.   Today, when people laud me for my work, I can't help but think, what if they knew me 7 years from now? They'd probably want my scalp on a pole, and no matter my contributions, no less. It doesn't lead to a very healthy attitude, of course. Our societies lack the culture of responsibility, and firstly, the responsibility to see our own fault."
TiADiscussion,3c6ydo,YarsAndTopol,3,Sun Jul 5 14:46:45 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your situation, and I think you must be lauded for coming out of that perspective and trying to better yourself as a person. It's difficult to see our own faults, especially when we have been shaped by the events that have happened to us. I can't say I didn't harbor anti-Muslim tendencies for a while. I did, but I didn't act on them. I was eternally suspicious of Muslim people and tried my best to steer clear from them, in order to prevent that sort of thing from happening again. But I realize that that was wrong of me, and it was hard to come to that realization, a lot more difficult than most would imagine, and I think you'd empathize with that somewhat. We're not infallible, even when we're the victim.  Life should be about growth, and growing into better people, and I'm glad you did just that. Thanks for sharing, I know it must've been hard."
TiADiscussion,3c6ydo,YarsAndTopol,2,Sun Jul 5 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know exactly where you're coming from, for me it was Muslims as well. And unfortunately, it really isn't that simple. Do Muslims, for example, do as a culture, and allow things to happen, that are reprehensible? Yes. Do they need to be pushed back against in certain areas? Yes. It's not completely unfounded. But then, extremist backlash of indiscriminate intolerance would only make them more sure of the correct way they're headed, and so on and so forth. These issues are complex, not prone to be solved through bold, unimaginitive activism for both sides, and rely on decades of work. But no, people want everything and now, and insist than in every case there's a victim and a perpetrator, and that one must be coddled, and the other utterly destroyed.  The objective reality is that in most cases, victims and perpetrators are the same people, societies and cultures.  The really pathetic thing about this, and I think you would agree, that when someone dehumanizes you, all it does is make you feel more in the right, not critically assess yourself because the critisism is wrapped in a thick layer of direct hate of you as an individual - and your natural response is to start dehumanizing those of that opposing front in return. It's basically ""if these people wish me harm, why shouldn't I wish them harm? That's exactly what I'm going to do, there, have your cake and eat it too!"".  And whoop-de-do, we're all rolling down the hill in a vicious cycle of smug self-righteousness. Not every person has the faculties to smash the breaks and ask where they're heading, and the those that surround them not only not help, they're gleefully stoking the fires."
TiADiscussion,3c6ydo,Captain_Alphabet,7,Sun Jul 5 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"I very much agree with this, thank you for posting it. I am involved quite deeply in the leftist student movement in the United States, so I know many people who hold the sort of views we usually repudiate here at TiA Discussion. One of the biggest problems I have with their worldview is that it is usually black and white - anyone who hold a remotely conservative or reactionary viewpoint is judged as if that viewpoint is their entire existence. People become one-dimensional objects to be shouted down and hated.   I feel like this can be solved by teaching people to think in shades of grey, and also to try to understand why humans do and believe the things they do. I, as an ardent leftist, sure as hell don't agree with conservatives but I don't hate them (after all, both my parents and grandparents are conservatives). Of course, there are some actions which we should not and perhaps cannot try to humanize the perpetrators, such as mass shootings or cruelty against animals / children."
TiADiscussion,3c6ydo,SantasElfBitch,3,Sun Jul 5 14:22:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this. I think it's important to not only be conscious of your own feelings but others as well. It's so easy to stay angry at someone who wronged you. It's not so easy to try to understand why they may be acting the way they do. This doesn't excuse the terrible things they do to you, but it still helps to get a better understanding of someone's situation instead of simply writing them off as the villain.   My mom told me that my grandfather was an abusive alcoholic to his wife and kids and he was that way because he fought in WWII and had PTSD. It doesn't excuse the terrible things he did, but it at least provides an explanation and goes to show that even though he did horrible things, he was still human and dealing with his own demons as well.  As for people changing, I think it's easier to forgive bullies if it happened when you were a kid. For me, I was bullied in elementary school and middle school. One of the girls who was mean to me then I actually get along with very well now that we're in our early 20s. Hell, I don't doubt that I've done some really mean shit when I was a kid, too. I honestly can't find it in myself to still be angry about things that happened over a decade ago. Especially since things happening back then were so petty compared to now. We were stupid kids back then. Kids sometimes take things too far without realising how hurtful they can be. But we grow up. We learn to be better people as adults and that's what matters."

We like science because the benefits of science have accrued to people like us: first world, middle class or higher, dominant culture, etc. We get to buy the iPads. We get to use the monstrously expensive neonatal intensive care units that our insurance pays for.  The costs of science have accrued to people at the bottom. It was barely a generation ago that our government was deliberately injecting black men with syphilis (EDIT: This was the Guatemala Study, my bad) and refusing to treat them. Even today, in many medical trials, the companies get people abroad to bear the costs, while developing drugs that we get to use.  Ours is a very Enlightenment-esque worldview, where we believe science and reason are good things that will improve the human condition. This is very fashionable on the internet, but not everyone shares it: because science and reason have utterly failed to improve their condition.  In the case of this telescope, this is absolutely true. This is just another case where the benefits of science accrue to people like us: we get to see and learn more about space, whereas the costs accrue to the communities actually living there.    I'm not saying we shouldn't build the telescope, but the protestors absolutely have a point, and we need to account for their interests, have a dialogue with them, and make concessions if necessary."

On that note, it takes orders of magnitude more investment in terms of man-hours of scientists and physicians to develop today's most advanced medical treatments than to execute such public health interventions (the latter of which has orders of magnitude more of a benefit, lol). Thus, for better or worse, the benefits of creating state-of-the-art ICUs and developing better medications accrue mostly to us.  What I'm trying to say is that ""science for the sake of science"" is not really a justifiable position to those at the bottom of society, because they get limited benefits from what most of our scientific and technological investment goes towards.  Now here's where the trap springs: you and I both know that we need both basic science and a lot of front-end effort before we can get actionable knowledge that can be applied to medical and industrial uses. And we're fine with that, because we don't have to brook the costs.  But it's indefensible if we don't address the concerns of people who do have to brook them."

Is it?  I would point out that the polio vaccine was deployed, in the third world and elsewhere, despite the fact that it was known that some small fraction of people receiving the vaccine would suffer side effects, some of them quite serious.  In spite of the fact that there were known, quantifiable physical harms being delivered by the vaccines, it was decided by the medical and governmental community that the benefits outweighed the risks.  In the case of the telescope, there are no quantifiable risks to building it, unless we accept the possibility that the native Hawaiian gods will smite us for our insolence.  The harm there is, at best, psychological, and arguably, aesthetic.  The payoff from the telescope may be lower and more long-term than mass polio vaccinations, but it doesn't seem too hard to make the case that the potential harm is consequently quite a bit lower for the telescope than the polio vaccine.  Let's consider another scenario, though.  Imagine it's 1957 and the proposal is to build a launch site on the summit of Mauna Kea, to kick off America's participation in the great 20th century space race.  Forget the logistical problems that ruled Hawaii out in the first place, and pretend that it's the best possible site within the American sphere of influence.  In that case, we could certainly make the same argument about the potential harm to the native Hawaiians - it is a spiritual harm, at best.  And we could turn around and say that the benefits of spaceflight are similarly remote to the natives - we're just indulging our white people fantasy of sailing to the stars, and the locals see little if any benefit.  Or do they?  With the benefit of hindsight, we can see all sorts of things that spun off from the space race - everything from weather satellites to pacemakers to digital communications and computing were advanced, or even directly descended from advances in spaceflight.  How many third world lives, or even Hawaiian lives, have been saved by early warnings of typhoons from orbiting satellites?  How many lives stand to be improved by access to cutting-edge agriculture or medicine or engineering via computers and the internet?  How many Hawaiians have pacemakers right now?  And could any of them have possibly predicted the benefits of spaceflight in 1957?  The point is - and I think from your penultimate paragraph, you're quite cognizant of it :) - that we don't, at this point, know what benefits we are giving up, what the opportunity cost of not building the telescope might be.  Might be nothing, might spark a revolution that directly benefits every single man, woman, and child on this green earth.  Are the harms, in that case, outweighed by the potential benefits?"

Maybe find a native healer who can discover a way that the gods might smile upon the building of the telescope.  Although, to be honest, I think the second is a bit silly - I strongly suspect that the number of modern Hawaiians who worship in the fashion of their ancestors is vanishingly small, making this more of a cultural heritage thing than a truly religious thing.

Even disregarding Christianity's majority status, if we're to take the ""tyranny of the minority"" argument they make seriously at face value, then we've not stopped biological, astronomical, or cosmological research for the sake of Hinduism, or Islam, or Judaism.  Nor have the countless scientists who've come from those cultural and religious traditions been held back.  Let's examine this another way. Some native Hawaiians are protesting. Fair enough. And yet how many share their cultural beliefs and aren't protesting? Are we supposed to listen to only one set and not the other? Which Hawaiians are we supposed to speak over?  Which rich traditions are we supposed to respect when one or two or ten of them say, ""that offends me!""  Yes, native Hawaiians lost their land. Their palaces were stormed by the United States. Their homes were seized in eminent domain. And they suffered for it.  Such is the nature of history. Such it is that in looking through the long and storied achievements of human history are they often, if not always, stained with blood. Even as we enter a new century, we can look back at the past century with sorrow. Even those that aren't bloody are still horrible: Turing's triumphs in World War II destroyed because when he closed his eyes at night he imagined his hand stroking hard pecs and not soft breasts. Or perhaps Rosalind Franklin's snub as a Nobel Laureate when Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were honored.  And those aren't counting the times that science has had a body count, such as the Nazi exposure research that has saved lives at the cost of life. Research that would have saved as many lives had it been conducted ethically and morally and without a cavalier disregard for human life -- and research that would have spat into the face of the lives it cost had it been thrown away, the very definition of ""died in vain"".  Such is our history.  But speaking of history and conquest, which conquerors are we supposed to pity, and which are we supposed to revile? If we're to hate the white men for conquering Hawaii from the Tahitians who migrated there after 1000 AD, are we supposed to hate the Tahitians who conquered it from the Marquesans who migrated there in the first millennium?  If conquest is evil, if conquerors are to be stopped, then are we supposed to consider the taking of Hawaii be whites to be some sort of cosmic poetic justice a thousand years in the making for the Tahitian migration to Hawaii eradicating Marquesan Hawaii?  What is the magic, arbitrary expiration date on conquest? When is not considered evil anymore? When no one's left alive to speak out against the original injustice? Or is it a time limit of a thousand years? Can a telescope be built in 2778?  What too about a telescope is it that offends the gods and the ancestors who dwell in that paradise? Is it so crowded in the volcanic afterlife it will push them off the mountain? Are the gods and souls there so weak that, even though they can live on after death, a concrete edifice will destroy them? What is it about the telescope that's dangerous to them? It's shape is entirely arbitrary -- is it the concrete and metal and glass and plastic? If it was made from volcanic rock and lensed from volcanic materials, would it be transparent to the intangible souls that dwell there?  If a god moved in there in 1300 AD, can he not simply destroy what offends him? Or, since he moved, not move elsewhere?  How do we pick and choose which conquerors to love and which to hate? How do we pick and choose what materials will destroy gods and great-grandparents?  How do we pick and choose which places are sacred -- of which the Earth is completely covered -- and which are only ""sort of"" sacred?  These questions have no logical answers, because they can't be answered. If, for example, we're to say conquerors are to be hated, then the native Hawaiians are to be hated, and therefore not listened to, and the telescope may as well go up. If we're to excuse their conquests, then we must excuse all conquests, and thus the telescope may as well go up.  This is true of any question written above. But it's not true of the question that follows this, which is: Are we the living, and the future living not yet born, to cede land endlessly to the dead, until the earth belongs to them, and be forced to, in essence, stand on Zanzibar -- assuming that's not sacred anymore -- not because of any overpopulation that Brunner imagined, but the polar opposite: An Earth so belonging to the dead that beyond our crowded island no one dares build or tread or explore, lest they step on the Earth that covers the ghosts and bones of those who no longer need the space.  And the answer is this: Yes, the spaces down here do matter. But they belong to the living. Should history fail to walk inexorably forward because our ankles are seized by the skeletons of the past reaching through the ground, we won't honor the dead; we'll join them.  Aside:   They were predictably terrible—the ugliest mix of armchair pedants, experts, and racists you could ever imagine. But the worst part was that a mere few years ago, that was me.   Why is this always the case with SJWs? Haha, just kidding, the answer is obvious: They've migrated from one intolerant, authoritarian system to another."

At the end of the day is the same irrational religious beliefs trumping scientific progress. The only difference for a SJW is one is mostly or entirely marginalized PoCs and one is mostly or entirely privileged whites; therefore one is a legitimate concern while the other is 'white tears' or whatever they want to call it.  And as I see it, you either regard all religious objections to scientific progress on 'sacred grounds' (which is what the Boxplot article talks about) as equally valid or you don't; you can't pick and choose which ones you support or not.  Would they support that woman who protested the Deep Impact experiment saying it ""ruined the natural balance of forces in the universe"". Does she not have a fair claim with her objection? I doubt a SJW would think so. But make it a small group of marginalized people instead of a white Russian woman, and they'd probably be singing a different tune.  I'm with you in that 'religious harm' is one that I'm also ok with inflicting, and if people cave to the protesters on religious grounds, on what basis do SJW reject the exact Evangelical reasons for being against stem cell research?"

I also grew up on the big island, with the last generation of telescopes in view every day, and I've gotten to go on insider tours of telescopes like Keck and Gemini (up close to the lenses and mirrors, as well as the optics tables and instruments below).    I am against the building of the thirty meter telescope, and have been opposing it since it was first being discussed many years ago.  The scientific positives do not outweigh the aesthetic negatives.  Probing the universe is a magnificent goal, but Hawaii is a unique and special place on the earth.  Mauna Kea is the  highest point for 2000 miles in any direction, in the middle of the the massive and beautiful pacific ocean.  I don't think that search for magnificence in the cosmos outweighs the value of magnificence on our own precious planet."

That is, if the design of the telescope was changed to blend in with the surroundings or in some other way, you'd support the project? I personally think the proposed design is already pretty pleasing as far as aesthetics go.  Also, I don't feel like describing the telescope's operation as ""searching for magnificence"" really captures its value. Say, what if observed certain phenomena that would make us reconsider current physical theories and calculations? There's concrete utility to be received and, perhaps, exploited in the future. The value of the mountain without a telescope is simply spiritual/aesthetic/recreational, which is something but not much. I could actually envision the telescope being a boost for all three of these values."

We can always say ""what if...?"", but that's a pretty flimsy argument given the empty track record so far.  The last 30 years have been a golden age for telescope based astronomy, and I think that's great - but nothing useful has resulted.  Let's be honest about our motivations: we build telescopes to fulfill fundamental curiosities, not because we expect a useful pay off.    There are other places to build telescopes.  The TMT is not even the largest next-generation telescope being proposed, that will be the Extremely Large Telescope in Chile.   I would like to see more orbiting telescopes like the Hubble being built; although I realize they are very challenging to make and are more of a compliment to ground based telescopes than a replacement.  The point is that Mauna Kea is a unique natural wonder, whereas there are other almost-as-good / in-some-ways-better places to put telescopes.    The TMT would be the tallest building on the entire island of Hawaii, and would be quite visible from all the cities and towns.  Knowing how these things go, islanders do not get much respect and the TMT will probably get their way if they are persistent.

They're pro-science as long as it's anti-religion, but a lot of them come down as anti-science when science stands on its own. It is true that the immediate benefits of scientific and technological advancements tend to only go to the wealthy. New gadgets do typically start off as toys for rich people, but over time they do normalize and spread out to everyone. Just look at cell phones these days. Now almost everyone in the US has more computing power in their pocket than we sent to the moon.  So ultimately I think the anti-science viewpoint comes from their desire to oppose anything that helps the privileged, even if it will eventually help the underprivileged as well. It makes no sense to me, but neither does most of this stuff. It's just short term vindictiveness.  Another thing I've noticed is that a lot of these people seem to want to improve quality of life for the underprivileged, but they also want humanity to go extinct so that we stop ruining everything.

Rules involving taxes, next of kin, divorce, etc can be applied in either case without significant alterations. I don't believe this is the case with a polygamous marriage. In order for polygamy to be viable you would need to come up with additions to the laws which would extend marriage into an n-party solution rather than just two parties, and extend it in a way that is fair to everyone.  That's where the question gets a little sticky for me. If the question is just ""Do you want polygamy legal?"" I would currently say no, given that the current legal framework of marriage doesn't make sense for an n-person union.

In your example, if B and D are already married, and B wants to marry A and C, then D must agree or divorce B, and A and C must agree to also marry D (if D doesn't divorce B), and A and C would also be regarded as married to each other."

(The first 3 would solve many issues and be relatively simple, the others somewhat harder.)  One would be to allow the signatory of any contract which includes reference to a spouse to nominate another adult (with that person's agreement, of course) to receive all benefits and accept all obligations of their spouse in that contract, irrespective of their marital status (with some mechanism for withdrawing that and offering it to someone else).  Another would be to forbid any discrimination on the grounds of marital status (which is done in some countries but not all).  Another would be to allow any person to nominate an ordered list of individuals to have the role of their nearest relatives in law, which takes precedence over any default near relatives as established by marriage or biology.   I'd also eliminate spousal privilege in law (and all the others apart from lawyer-client, which is necessary for the operation of the law).  I'd abolish all alimony, except where the paying party used abusive means to prevent the recipient maintaining their earning capacity, or where explicitly provided for in a prenuptial agreement.  Child custody could be handled by granting custody equally to both biological parents (if the father can be found—if he cannot within a reasonable time then both his rights and obligations are nil unless and until he is found and voluntarily accepts them), but allowing either parent to alone give up their half-relationship in the legal abandonment window, or afterwards with the consent of the other parent(s), and allowing second-parent adoption even if the child has more than one parent, provided there is the unanimous consent of all parents.  A final, and more controversial (because it would inevitably harm a few married couples), change would be to remove all tax benefits from marriage and instead give equivalent benefits to either cohabiting adults or to parents as appropriate."

Instead, I'd like to address this asinine idea that supporting gay marriage but not supporting polygamy is necessarily hypocritical.  Here's the thing. You may take ""consenting adults"" as the foundational moral precept that informs your support for gay marriage, but I don't, at all. Instead, my foundational moral precept is equality, i.e. all men are created equal, and no legitimate government can prohibit certain people from rights or privileges on the basis of a natural condition of their birth (race, sex, etc). There can be legitimate prohibitions on certain things (drugs, polygamy, endangered tiger pelts) that apply to everyone equally. You may think the particular prohibitions are stupid, but that's different from the equality argument.  Prohibiting same-sex marriage is bullshit because it uses a natural condition (sex) as the basis for determining whether you can do it or not (You may marry your beloved, but only if you have the right genitals) It's the same damn argument we had with Loving v. Virginia. Polygamy, in contrast, is a radically different structure that is prohibited to everyone, equally.  That's why they're different."
TiADiscussion,3c4tff,masstrespass,12,Sun Jul 5 06:15:34 2015 UTC,"I support gay marriage. I supported the recent Supreme Court decision.  I will never support polygamy.   My main reason is consequentialist. Polygamy creates societies with surplus men, increased intrasexual competition among men, crime, and violence. You can read more about the matter here. The British Columbia Supreme Court arrived at a similar conclusion.  Now, SJWs try to counter this by saying ""Polygamists have always been around! Just like LGBT people have been around since the dawn of time! Laws don't change things!""  Sexual orientation, as far as we know, is biologically ingrained. Thus, LGBT people exist and will exist independent of social norms. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no evidence of biological polygamy or even biological predisposition to polygamy.  Polygamy is a behavioral choice, a choice whose manifestation is contingent on many factors, including societal approval or disapproval. I mean, unless you want to argue that people in polygamous societies are biologically different to us, you have to concede that polygamy is a matter of behavior, and thus societal countenance can help it appear more often.  In the absence of societal countenance, polygamy is and will be limited to the most liberal and sexual people who don't care much for said approval. These fringe bohemians are a minor issue at worst. But if polygamy receives legal sanction, then what do you expect will happen? People who wouldn't have participated in the practice before now start doing so, now that a major barrier is gone. Wealthier men start accruing multiple wives. And we get all the attendant problems that the scientists and judges I linked to discussed.  That's the crux of the consequentalist argument against polygamy, I think. Here's another good article on the matter, as well as a counter to the claims in the article you linked.Oh, and there are other reasons as well.  1) Some people say it will become a shield for men to import multiple dependent women from abroad and take advantage of them. This starts raising issues of consent, coercion, and abuse.  2) It will be a complete nightmare for divorce and inheritance law. What happens when, after a father dies, his estate mostly went to Wife 1's son, but Wife 2's son contests the validity of the will? This isn't a hypothetical, this WILL happen.

TiADiscussion,3c4tff,Subrosian_Smithy,2,Sun Jul 5 06:42:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is that the two aren't equivalent. Polygamy has occurred in the vast majority of human cultures on Earth, though it gave way to monogamy in most of them. According to the science on the matter, it has to do with the problem of surplus men that polygamy inherently creates.  In contrast, polyandry is very rare in history, possibly due to a male in a situation of polyandry not being sure of paternity. It has really only occurred in societies as a way to control birthrates and halt population growth, as in some Tibetan tribes and in famine-stricken, suffering regions.  I don't doubt your experience, but we have to remember that there is a massive sampling bias here. Right now, our culture (and legal system) strongly frowns on polygamy. The only people who are willing to go against that are people who heavily skew liberal and sexual.  The issue is that when our legal system, and slowly after that, our culture, stop frowning and starts smiling on the matter, we'll have many more people participating in the practice (unlike sexual orientation, polygamy is a behavior). Then, we'll see a lot more polygamy, as we have in history.  As for polyandry, that's more of a wildcard. The dream is that it will become as popular as polygamy, but honestly, given what we have observed in history, the evolutionary concerns over paternity inherent to polyandry, and how we know that the male sex drive dwarfs that of the female, I highly doubt that polyandry will become popular outside of fringe bohemian circles."

The United States as a whole would reach that ratio if, for example, 5 percent of men took two wives, 3 percent took three wives, and 2 percent took four wives — numbers that are quite imaginable, if polygamy were legal for a while. In particular communities — inner cities, for example — polygamy could take a toll much more quickly. Even a handful of ""Solomons"" (high-status men taking multiple wives) could create brigades of new recruits for street gangs and drug lords, the last thing those communities need.   Declining interest in marriage doesn't really matter if all we need are some people interested in marriage and bigamy/polygamy to get the ball rolling on destabilizing society.  It's a false equivalence to relate this to the drug war. We have little if any evidence or literature to suggest that the drug war has been successful. We have evidence covering millennia of human cultures to show how polygamy, which has existed in some form over the vast majority of cultures, failed and has been phased out.

In my opinion, polygamy puts too much of a strain on familial relations and can lead to a disconnected sense of relationship and (cue the irony and pitchforks) may really affect the sanctity of marriage.

It's irritating enough when that comes from a female feminist, but when a male feminist comes out and says it's absolute pure misogyny, the kind they claim to fight against.     Like, feminism says it's about women's choice, and freedom, etc.  But then Onision, a man, comes around and says women HAVE to follow this, and if they don't, they're either stupid or unenlightened.  He gives himself a pass to treat women who aren't feminists like complete shit.  He's a sexist, against women AND men (by his own admission) and he uses feminism as his shield to project it off himself.  A man truly feminist would never suggest or imply a woman should have to do anything besides follow the laws of their land and attempt to be a decent person."

He knows his fanbase is primarily teenage girls (who tend to be just as horny and dumb as teenage boys). His most recent ex AND his current wife were both underage when he fuckedmet them  He's a piece of shit who has treated most of the women in his life like shit.

Did she really believe that fucking Ramsay Bolton would treat Sansa like a princess?   What happened is that they (stupidly) expected that Sansa would somehow morph into a fucking ninja and murder Ramsay in some completely horrific awesome way, thus allowing them to Mary Sue themselves into vicarious heroism.  This despite the fact that Sansa is almost completely passive during the entire story - and even more so in the books than in the show - and basically gets pushed, moved, or manipulated from one setting to another throughout the series, through no desire or choice or action of her own, as you mentioned.  You'd have to be a complete dumbass to actually expect that to happen - that's just not how GRRM rolls - but I think they did, and when they were denied the chance to have that I Am Woman Hear Me Roar moment, they reacted badly.  Very badly."

TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,augustelantier,8,Sat Jul 4 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"The Sansa rape was horrid storytelling and character development. It set her back to season 2, when she was Joffrey ' s victim. Maybe SJW overreacted,  but it is not a reason to believe that the show runners handled Sansa' s storyline correctly."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,augustelantier,4,Sat Jul 4 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it was a terrible way to handle Sansa, but she wasn't a good character to begin with. I believe it was the rape itself that pushed the SJWs away, not the storyline. Really, if you're looking for poor storytelling and awkward digressions, it would Bran's warg arc. That was utter shit compared to Sansa's rape."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,lifeonthegrid,2,Sat Jul 4 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree. She is a coherent character,  with a very interesting storyline into the vale. Her story in the books seems to make her more aware of the game (not saying she's going to be a master player immediately, of course) and moving forward. You may not like her character,  I understand, but in aFfC she is a far cry from the girl she was in aCoK. I personally love Sansa and I am willing to discuss her if you wish.   The rape is also another problem. Sorry if this sounds like SJW talk to you,  but using rape as they did in the story is a very very very tired trope. Like, it is unbelievably cliché, boring,  predictable and incoherent. In the show,  rape has indeed been used as a cheap way to create drama and it is (God I feel bad saying this word) problematic.  But Sansa 'srape is more like the cherry on top of the cake : it follows Cersei's rape, Craster's daughters rape and others. And even worse : tommen's rape, that has been played for laughs. It all shows that the show runners have no problems using rape as a plot tool, whether a tragic or a comedic one,  and that's not good quality TV.   Also,  many things were shit in the fourth and fifth seasons. Bran and Sansa are ones among many."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,augustelantier,3,Sat Jul 4 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"Well I can't say I've read the books, because I haven't. I agree, rape has been used far too much as a plot point, but can you really say it was used less than, say murder? My opinion of Sansa was all to do with the show and not the books, really."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,EmptyEmptyInsides,-4,Sat Jul 4 17:54:43 2015 UTC,You can't tell the story of Game of Thrones without murder. You can tell it without rape. It's apples and oranges.
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,___Rhand___,3,Sat Jul 4 20:29:00 2015 UTC,"You can't actually say that. Murder is as much a part of story development as rape is a part of character development. You can't argue that a story would remain the same if you cut out a part of it.  Rape is a tired trope, but you can't simply say that ""Well, if we removed it all it would be the same"" because the characters wouldn't be. In some ways, rape is a crucible that (mostly) female characters go through. Similar to how Theon's torture was his crucible, rape is a part of character development."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,Thiscoward,2,Sat Jul 4 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, rape should be part of character development. Let's say, Cersei's marital rape by Robert when he forced himself on her (not shown but she reflects on it IIRC). It is linked to her character development and one of the reasons she killed her husband. Or Daenerys's rape by her husband progresses towards a more equal relationship as she affirms herself as a Dothraki Queen. In the books,  a character named Pia is raped but her rapists are punished,  to show the character development of Jaime. Jeyne,  whose role is played by Sansa,  shows Theon's path to redemption. That's rape being correctly used a a plot device.   Now,  Sansa's rape accomplished nothing. It breaks her character development to progress Theon's.  The Cratser's daughters rape,  or the little girls abuse by Meryn Trant  are just here to show bad guys are bad. These are all added by the TV show. Contrast that with the books,  where the Mad king's rape of his wife is used to ask the question of the Kingsguards role: should they blindly obey the King or do what is right? This question is what tourment Jaime through the whole story.   Rape isn't unfilmable and should never be. But,  if it doesn't have a point,  if it just shows that a bad guy is bad or if it breaks a character's arc,  then it is useless."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,TheDefinitionOfSmug,4,Sat Jul 4 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"Jeyne, whose role is played by Sansa, shows Theon's path to redemption. That's rape being correctly used a a plot device.  Now, Sansa's rape accomplished nothing. It breaks her character development to progress Theon's.   I don't understand how you can view Jeyne as a proper vehicle for Theon's redemption then say that Sansa in the same role accomplishes nothing. Even if you think it hurts her development it still helps Theon, so why would it now accomplish nothing?  Personally I think that Sansa is useful in this role in ways that Jeyne isn't. Finding out that her brothers could still be alive, allowing some level of reconciliation between her and Theon, both in what we've seen and what could be to come.  No, that's not how the books have done it (I haven't read the books but am familiar with the storyline). The show has to make some compromises because some things just don't work as well there; they got enough heat for shelving Bran this season where I don't think viewers would have been happier with them shelving Sansa. There wasn't an awful lot going on at the Vale this season and forcing things there could have had a more dramatic departure from the books than this did.  I don't think the Sansa rape was there to show the bad guys were bad, I think it's a natural consequence of putting Sansa in Winterfell, which opens up other doors both for her arc and other arcs (not just Theon but the Boltons, other North factions, Brienne, potentially Jon and the wall, etc). You can't marry her off to Ramsay and have this not be the inevitable result. Maybe they could have showed and mentioned it less altogether with it still being heavily implied, perhaps that would have appeased people but I'm not sure why it should have, at least on more than an emotional level. They could have made her more callous and domineering and seem like less of a broken victim over it. I could see them having done better here, but that's a fine line to walk. They don't want to make her too emotionally broken. I do think they've still managed to work in some development along these lines in her interactions with Myranda and particularly when she talked down to and shamed Ramsay for being a bastard and serving a bastard king."
TiADiscussion,3c3q5z,Thiscoward,3,Sun Jul 5 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I would say that Daenerys is the feminist's pet character, not Sansa. Many people see her as an empowerment fantasy.  She rises to power in what was heretofore very much a man's world. She doesn't play by the rules (sometimes violently so, as in Astapor), she makes her own. This is in contrast to Brienne, who adheres strongly to personal codes of honor and despite aggressively challenging gender norms, receives anemic support at best from feminists or indeed anyone.   She has the radical outlook and ""change the world"" mentality of the sixteen-year-old she is, except she has dragons and supersoldiers, which give her the means to accomplish her vision. No doubt many younger feminists with such outlooks wish they could actualize their dreams for the world - but Daenerys can, and that's why they love her.  She has a lot of ""you go grrrrl"" moments and a lot of lines that seem designed just to induce that reaction among her audience (""hurr hurr break the wheel."")  She is the great white savior, coming to destroy and rebuild the societies of the ignorant brown savages for their own good, which seemingly appeals to many feminists since I can hardly see any of them critiquing such racially charged scenes.    So yeah, I would say Daenerys is the feminist pet character. It annoys me, because I'm stuck in a world where people who talk about GoT can talk about nothing except how awesome Daenerys is.  But as for Sansa: most people I talk to just find her annoying. Shame, because I think she's a really interesting."

But also I like the position she is in of a young person with a good deal of power learning what she needs to do. She has good advisers, two (three ish?) armies under her belt, a name of note, a mind to occasionally make good moves on her own, and dragons. But she fucks up a lot like neglecting the dragons when they are a top tier weapon, leaving towns she had just conquered, poor choices on understanding cultures she takes over. Basically I have hopes she will be great but being 16 isn't there yet.  Oh, and for her constant want for peace and happiness she can get very violent, that disturbs me. Zero to sixty on the roasting people alive for unproven crimes thing.  But I know exactly what you mean about people worshiping Daenerys. From some conversations it seemed the people thought she could do no wrong."

Yeah, I've always thought it was pretty clear that GRRM's arc with her was eventually going to be, ""Hey, nice ideas and all, but grow the fuck up"" -- something she's potentially set up to learn from Tyrion.  I hope he doesn't soften that message due to some swell of pride for the good intentions of modern youth. I imagine the book will hold the course, but the show might indulge some of that, which does suck because that's the thing most people will see... but at least maybe the original arc will exist in some form."

Nearly forgot she now has Tyrion as an adviser, excited about that as early on I wanted her and him to enter into a loveless political marriage so they could gain from each other.

Identity matters a whole lot, and their role models have to be a part of the oppressed class, but also rich and famous. He being nonwhite is a big plus, as we all know, white people oppress, and hence cannot be role models. She is in control of her sexuality: The problem isn't with women being sexualized, it's with who is doing the sexualizing. That's why we find feminists railing against video games with scantily-clad characters, citing that they have no agency of their own. That's a whole other discussion in and of itself, but she is ""in control"" of her sexuality, so her lecherous behavior is exposed.   3.She isn't conventionally attractive: Her body isn't the thin, white model that SJWs have convinced themselves is the norm for attractiveness. She's even gotten ass enhancements. While she is thin, she doesn't conform to the patriarchy beauty standards SJWs hav set.

It's a moderately nuanced situation, so I'm not surprised that the media, social or otherwise, is mangling it so thoroughly. For posterity: there are three points that are worth mentioning:   If Nicki Minaj feels that she has taken control of her own sexuality, and thus that anything she agrees to do is, implicitly, her expressing that sexuality. she's not wrong. (points: social justice bloggers) While it is convenient that Minaj is so personally validated by her stage persona, the reason we get to see her on a national stage is because music executives approve of that persona, which may have even been crafted for her. Her success is or was contingent on cooperating with the suits and all the nebulous external forces they  represent.

TiADiscussion,3c05ef,silverjazz,11,Fri Jul 3 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't write ""you're only transgender after you transition publicly"" like you inserted, I wrote that she hadn't transitioned at the time of Pulp Fiction, without saying outright why this was relevant. I thought it was implied by the context.  I don't think anyone is saying that Cox is the only actress that could have played the role in OITNB. The point is that that role is relatively unique and significant, and her being black has nothing to do with that even if it hits on TWoC appeal.  Don't know why you think I'm commenting on OITNB if you think I haven't seen it but I have and I don't see it as especially SJW. I haven't read her interviews so she could very well be an SJW herself but that doesn't mean the show is particularly SJW, even if SJWs like it."
TiADiscussion,3c05ef,carlinmack,8,Fri Jul 3 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"Of course trans people are still trans before undergoing transition, but there's clearly a difference between an actor who is not out or transitioning and one who is out, transitioned, and doing activism to support trans people.

Jenji Kohen is an expert level SJW panderer and she knows they fetishize black and transgendered individuals so she killed two birds with the casting of Laverne Cox. Keep in mind she was a reality TV star before her role on OITNB. While Arquette had been acting for decades and surrounded by actors her whole life.  There's also a sense of if its black it's better, Taylor Swift is out there fighting multi billion dollar corporations who are 'oppressing' poor singer song writers many are poc/women/transgender and all the labels sjws love. They hate TS and find any reason to gather more people to hate her.  Beyoncé steals from singer songwriters with the help of billion dollar corporations and she's beloved by sjws."

Alexis Arquette has not been in the public eye for decades and it doesn't really matter that she was surrounded by these other actors. That is why she is unpopular.  So what if Laverne made her way into acting through reality TV? That's not related to the discussion.  Taylor Swift doesn't actually get that much hate tbh, she recently made the music video to Bad Blood was very well received as it featured many nonsexualised female celebrities. She is also a self proclaimed feminist and fights the medias stereotype of her being a heart breaker  (If you want someone tumblr actually dislikes, try Meghan Trainor or Iggy Azalea)  Can I get a source on the stuff about Beyonce?

TiADiscussion,3c05ef,EmptyEmptyInsides,9,Fri Jul 3 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"Okay so I suppose I am classed as tumblr. I don't like her music, but I do like the things she stands for. She tells her fans to stay at school (link) and get the best grades they can because not everyone can make it as an entertainer. While being silly and sexual, she is also very serious and has a business.  Also Nicki is talented. I am not a fan of hip hop but it is easy to see the difference between her and Iggy's freestyles (struggling to find the video comparing them). Tumblr dislikes Iggy because her fame seems to not be the result of talent. (If you listen to Iggy's freestyle in concert it is very difficult to make out the words.)   Btw concerning white hip hop artists, Macklemore realises that he is appropriating black culture in his song White Privilege - if you don't understand the SJW argument I would recommend listening or at least reading the lyrics"
TiADiscussion,3c05ef,carlinmack,5,Fri Jul 3 18:20:02 2015 UTC,"That's fair, I can see how encouraging children to stay in school and owning a business are legitimate reasons to idolize her. Also, I can admit she's definitely more talented than Iggy Azalea (though, imho, not very talented overall.)  However I'm still not understanding why just being white in the rap/hip hop industry is appropriation of black culture. Sure, the genre has been predominately black in history, but does that mean that rapping is strictly a thing that black people do? It seems racist to say so. Culture is important to identity and I understand that, but music is something to be shared, that everyone should be allowed to try. Hating on white rappers just for being white seems to gentrify the genre more, and reinforce the idea that rap/hip hop is a 'black thing.'  However, I might just be looking at it the wrong way. What are your thoughts on it?"
TiADiscussion,3c05ef,EmptyEmptyInsides,2,Fri Jul 3 18:43:13 2015 UTC,I think the main points behind the appropriation is the imitation of accents and white people talking about stuff they haven't done to try to fit in. People don't get angry at eminem because he mostly speaks about his experience living as a poor white in a bad neighbourhood. (Macklemore on the other hand speaks more about social issues and his experience being one of the rich white kids at school)  It seems to me that Iggy talks about shooting people and doing drugs but there is no real evidence that she's done any of that.
TiADiscussion,3c05ef,Tacticalrainboom,4,Fri Jul 3 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"Aren't there also black hip hop artists who are fake gangsta, some who were even born in upper class families? Should they be accused of cultural appropriation too? Because clearly they aren't."

Because by creating a proper family and raising kids to be good persons and proper citizens(in my opinion) is one of the main way's of improving society and evolving it and the human species. But I am not advocating that everyone needs to start having kids right now, nor that it is the only way to improve society. But that most people should at least think of it and try it once they are in the financial position to do so and have found the right person to start a family with. My reasoning for this is that this is how society functioned and evolved in the west for centuries and it has worked( not necessary the nuclear family but just the family in general as older families tended to also include grandparents under the same roof)  Some people do use it directly as an excuse. But most ""rebellious"" teenagers rebellion encompass the potato-gender ideas as a way to be as different as possible from their parents and to ""stick it to the man and another part of the rebellion is to not try to start a family."

No one is required to procreate, and even if they were, I think most gender specials on tumblr are using their ""uniqueness"" to be unique and to have something to whine about, not to forestall having kids or getting married. I mean, a lot of the people we talk about on here are teenagers or people in their early 20s - people who probably aren't even really thinking about starting a family anyway.   I'm also just confused by the line in your post saying that all things gender related are related to biological sex. What do you mean by that? When I say I don't really buy into gender, I mean that when people say they ""feel"" like a boy or a girl or a stargender or whatever, all they are doing is subscribing to a set of gender roles: ""I like football and the color blue - therefore I am a boy!"" type thing. To me, that's really self-limiting. I'm a woman because I have the reproductive organs and DNA of a woman. That's it. Obviously there are people who truly have sex dysphoria. I'm not denying that.

I mean that. Most guys like sports and are expected to like sports because of the two sexes they are the ones who are better. Most women like cooking and are expected to cook because it is seen as a more nurturing activity and expected of the female sex. I guess most of my reasoning is due to the culture and society I am raised in (Romanian) where gender is not even a word in the language.

It won't even be an option when the fossil fuel runs low ending the green revolution.
TiADiscussion,3byfs9,raindient,3,Fri Jul 3 09:10:14 2015 UTC,"Except that the old people are useless as most of their skills are becoming worthless and it's nearly impossible to re train them, meanwhile we haven't increased the life span of a person by that much.  And there are too little people being born to counter that.  Meanwhile unemployment is caused by multiple factors:  Cheap labour is not cheap in the west. Need of a worthless diploma even for manual labour jobs. Small companies taking a giant hit with the economic crisis meaning there are less jobs. And lots of people taking up education for jobs with few opportunities and low pay, like arts.  And this is not about growth but maintaining a stable population. Because if that is failed. Most states will go through massive instabilities and issues do to the states not having a working budget, companies lacking the markets to sell their products and a increase in the vulnerability of areas to disasters or economic problems."

Some people choose to be child free and that's fine. That is their decision. Some know they'd be a bad parent or they literally just don't want kids.  Second, some people are sterile. They literally have no purpose in life according to you.  Third, I am transgender and if I could have kids I would. That's not an option for me because the HRT has made me sterile. Add to that that my boyfriend wants to remain child free.  From a purely biological stand point you'd be right about procreation being the objective of any species.

TiADiscussion,3bya7p,caelitus,7,Fri Jul 3 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"There is a concise writeup of the shoplifting tag and its pitfalls here. It's worth a read.  The gist / my commentary: Some people surely shoplift food, clothes, and medicine for their very survival. There are other threads and other times better suited to talking about these people, since the shoplifting tag is about something else entirely. The shoplifting tag is for people who steal makeup and other luxury items and post about their hauls on omg kawaii anarchism (◡‿◡✿) tumblr blogs.  As always, motives vary. Some probably sincerely believe that their actions are ""anticapitalist"" and somehow are cheat-codes to hurt the bottom lines of the upper .01% of incomes. These people are critically wrong. Some others want specific free shit, and others still just enjoy the rush theft provides, or the social support they have found among fellow thieves.  Does that help?"

They don't steal cats and Macy's dresses and Sephora makeup. They don't feel so disgustingly, contemptibly proud of what they're doing, and if confronted by it, probably wouldn't screech about ""sticking it to the man"" or whatever.  No, kleptomania is an actual disorder and Tumblr is the place to go to make people feel that stealing is right. And even if they don't have kleptomania and are just a bunch of prissy rich girls, they'll still feel that it's right and that they're 100% safe on Tumblr when they post their hauls.

Personally I don't care if someone shoplifts from a huge corporation, but if you're going to live the rogue lifestyle its fucking stupid to post it all over Tumblr.   I've seen some people act as if shoplifting is this massively atrocious moral crime, its honestly not. Its not a good, moral thing, but at the end of the day most of these people are kids and who among us did not shoplift as a teenager?  No way should we endorse it, but kids are getting up to way worse shit.    Most of us do illegal things all the time. I love to steal pens from doctors offices and such. If I find a nice writing pen at work or just sitting around I can't help myself. I don't steal pens from stores...just pens that are in use. I can't explain this behaviour of mine.     Lol @ self righteous downvoters, I'm sure if we looked into your lives they'd be soooo perfect!"
TiADiscussion,3bya7p,strawberrylime13,2,Fri Jul 3 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"maybe not, but I don't fucking steal and use the excuse  ""oh they are huge corporations"", like it's no big deal to them.

TiADiscussion,3bya7p,nahbro80,0,Mon Jul 6 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"It's not an excuse to justify behaviour, but it is different than stealing from a person/small business.  In the grand scheme of things, it's really damaging society.  Those corporations are damaging society more by their own practices, and while shoplifting isn't a way to ""get back at them"", I find it really difficult to give a corporation worth millions (probably billions) any sympathy.    When I worked retail, cutbacks were never made for LP. It's somewhat of a myth that if someone shoplifts, the whole company (and the world!) will crumble.  The rates of shoplifting haven't really risen, it's just that there's this trend of documenting it on Tumblr.    I'd just like to hear of one situation where a person is called into their boss' office and told that the pen/cd theft limit has been reached, and so they must let them go. The number 1 thing to influence payroll is sales and conversion.  I've just never heard of LP getting so out of control that they have to start letting people go or raise prices.  My store pulled $50,000 in sales one MORNING last year during Christmas.  I'm not sure what the shrink was, but we were usually in pretty good shape.    I also really resent some of what I've seen people doing where they essentially dox these kids and turn them in themselves.  People need to stop being fucking internet heroes - they have no idea if they are helping or actually hurting these kids by doing that.  I guarantee most of these kids will stop the behaviour on their own, and if they don't, they will get caught somewhere along the line."

TiADiscussion,3bwr41,Namkcalb,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:03:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, but everyone must be clear that I didn't write this.  *Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, ""politically correct"" types. All we are trying to do is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call ""feelings of inferiority"" and ""over-socialization.""  FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY  By ""feelings of inferiority"" we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strictest sense but a whole spectrum of related traits: low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. These feelings are expressed as political correctness. They have their stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual, white males from middle-class families.  Although leftists identify with minority groups, the leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to satisfy everyone's needs for them, take care of them. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition, as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation.  Modern leftist philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But their attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false (i.e. failed, inferior). The leftist cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual's ability or lack of it.  Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. The leftist cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Self-hatred is a leftist trait. Hostility too is a prominent component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for power.  OVER-SOCIALIZATION  Our society socializes children by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society's expectations. The over-socialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality. Over-socialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another. Leftists of the over-socialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.  Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem. The goals of today's leftists are not in conflict with the accepted morality: the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. These have been deeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes). Leftists, especially those of the over-socialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles. In effect, however much he may deny it, the over-socialized leftist wants to integrate everyone into the system and make them adopt its values.  By their own account, violence is for them a form of ""liberation."" If they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like. Today's society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society.*"

Many of our prime ministers were far from perfect, but that doesn't make them any less important. Seriously, John A. was an alcoholic and Mackenzie King was totally nuts and had seances with his dog, but they made an impact on the country for good or ill. Honouring them for their contributions can be done without worshipping them as though they were perfect beings; they were products of their time.   My main concern is just the expense on a struggling university (I did my undergrad there and they're so terrible with money) as well as the aesthetic aspect. Blouw is planning on having a statue of every prime minister, since the artist who wants to design them got rejected by the city of Kitchener. I don't know where they could possibly put them without looking horrendously kitschy, especially since the university fits in a city block and there isn't much free space. Wilf sitting in the quad makes sense, the university is named after him (albeit mainly because his name matched the acronym for Waterloo Lutheran), but no one else really fits.

For example: discussions of unjust actions done to blacks by white police officers amount to 'white privilege' because that particular whitey hasn't experienced it.   It's not a privilege though if it's an injustice done to someone else. Talking about it as a privilege towards white people only amounts to how we can make white people less privileged. It says nothing about removing the injustice towards blacks.   So in my opinion, these discussions by white people are inherently narcissistic.

If you don't mind me painting with a broad brush for a moment, Americans are generally brought up to believe in high ideals and the greatness of America and the rightness of its institutions.  However, American history, and for that matter world history ~1500-1950 -does- have a strong element of ""nasty things Europeans did to everyone else,"" of which have very visible and present impacts in the modern day; depending on their political orientation, they may see this as still ongoing.  This dilemma and cognitive dissonance can be pretty jarring--how can America both be the ""Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave"" and the bloodstained playground of robber barons?  And more personally, how can someone be a ""good person"" while directly or indirectly benefiting from the evils of the world and it's history?  For a fair number of people, the answer to these questions is ""white guilt.""  I'd say a tangentially-related topic is a kind of...cultural self-blindness.  It's easy for people, or at least some people, to devalue and take for granted the culture that they live in--to borrow a well-worn metaphor from the SJWs, it's the water they swim in.  Meanwhile, when/if they're exposed to aspects of another culture, it's something new, fresh, and exotic.  It's not hard to see people, especially the ""white guilty,"" valuing and fetishizing other cultures above their own.  As for myself, I'm white, male, a history buff, and somewhat multicultural, so I've lived some of this.  But I've made my peace with it, and I appreciate American and European culture as well as those farther abroad."

In other words, you have went from empty prairie to the center of the world in less than 400 years. Do you have any idea how freaking great for the world as a whole what white people (and a little bit of black people) have done in the US? You invented industrialism. You founded a country for the first time ever, based on religious freedom. The US is (or at least was) the land of the free. Slavery had been common all over the world for thousands of years, but it was first illegal in the US. Then a loophole caused one guy to be allowed to actually own a slave (he happened to be black if that matters), which opened up for actual owning of slaves, making slave trade much more profitable and common.   American history is the biggest success story for white people ever, and the amount of horrible things done are actually quite low. (at least compared to the rest of history) It's basically just that they drove the indians off their land, and held slaves (like the rest of the world at that time) which they are guilty of.   It is unfortunate that there has been so much racism in the US though. However, by being racist against each other one doesn't solve that, that only makes an even bigger gap between people. I think ""colorblindness"" is the best way to avoid racism, benevolent or not. However SJWs don't want that, they want victim privilege for black people, and they want to be able to hate with a clean conscience."

To put it another way, I think that some of them definitely think that what their ancestors did was wrong, but they probably also still harbor at least some racist ideas. In a racially-charged culture, it's hard not to.   One reason these situations may seem awkward to you is that I think the self-flagellation routine is often an indirect way of someone trying to prove to you that he or she is not a racist, without saying it directly.

Ultimately, tho, it's a misplaced emotional response. For one, being the beneficiary of the prejudicial treatment of others does not mean that you're guilty of perpetrating it. For another, it's just not very useful. It's nice that people recognize injustice and want to help, but the feeling of guilt usually leads more to people doing superficial things that are visible to assuage their guilt.

TiADiscussion,3brpp9,night1172,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"I sincerely think that the United States government, and elites in the upper echelons of corporate power, have done some awful things through the course of our nation's history: the deaths of native peoples across this continent, the slavery of blacks, and hatred of the Irish in the late 19th and early 20th century just to name a few of the governmentally sanctioned issues.  In many cases, these practices benefitted predominantly white, moneyed land owners, corporate leadership (also predominantly white throughout our history), and the government itself.  What I don't think is that it is my duty to confess the sins of people with the same skin tone as myself and ask for forgiveness every waking hour of everyday.  The first of my European ancestors did not land on this continent until 1895 and they were both Irish who wrote about the hatred of Irish men and women and the contempt they found in New York before migrating to Texas to be farmers.  Then followed the Germans in the early 1910's, and then the Czech in the 1920's.  All of them received much the same hatred because of their immigrant status.  Two of my ancestors married Native American women and raised families with them in the pandhandle of Texas, writing about the treatment of their children in the schoolhouse for being of mixed races.    The sad fact is that while our family history cannot compare to one filled with slavery or murders due to race, I, like many other ""white men"" have a family lineage that is not purely white and filled with ""privilege"". That is not to say that I do not see that being raised where and when I was raised has given me benefits that are not seen in this country's ghettos or the ""projects"" and other low income areas of America where our government hides minority and white poor alike.  But much of the ""white guilt"" you'll see paraded out in public is done by glad handers who want desperately to feel an emotional charge with someone who has had it worse than they do, so that when they go home at night they can say ""I did something today...I feel so much better about myself!""    So, yes, I think hey are trying to impress you or anyone they consider an oppressed group, while the rest of us quietly go through our day doing whatever it is that we do and trying not to be what SJW's paint us to be, which is privileged shitlords, but rather just living our lives out and being just as confused about the meaning of life as anyone else is, regardless of sexual orientation, gender, race, eye color, or number of fingers and toes."

TiADiscussion,3bt07p,airs_eight_white,3,Thu Jul 2 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"Social justice warriors have adopted tactics and positions associated with the right and the extreme right, but they are not conservative.  As Haidt explains, one of the largest differences between liberals and conservatives is how they regard the concept of fairness. Conservatives generally consider equality of opportunity fair, and contrariwise, liberals advocate for equality of outcomes. Currently, outcomes are not equal, but formal equality of opportunity exists in most of the West.  Therefore, social justice has descended into a massive exercise in the ultimate attribution error. Successful people are dismissed as merely lucky, unfairly advantaged, reliant on a biased system, or otherwise undeserving of a positive outcome. They are the oppressors. Racist, sexist, backwards. Evil.  For example, the book Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell, posits that good outcomes are merely a matter of chance and ends with the remark: ""Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success."" Similarly, The Ant and the Grasshopper (which Haidt mentioned) was remade during the New Deal Era to portray the ant as cruel and uncharitable.  Social justice warriors take the attribution error to a ridiculous extreme. Even the perfectly ordinary behavior of the ""oppressor class"" is imbued with malignant purpose. Hence ""manspreading"". Because even sitting normally reinforces the patriarchy and victimizes all women everywhere.  But...  Here in the United States, equality of outcomes will never actually happen. The Constitution (Amendments I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, XIV) makes a move to democratic socialism impossible, and it is highly unlikely that the Constitution will be amended or scrapped.  With no legal recourse to advance their agenda, social justice warriors have resorted to the Puritan punishments of public shaming, social alienation, and excommunication. Insults like ""shitlord"", ""man-baby"", ""virgin neckbeard"", ""regressive"", and ""literally Hitler"" are all attempts at finding a scarlet letter for the modern age. Having your employer shamed into firing you because you were branded a bad person on social media is the new version of having to live alone on the edge of town.  Oddly, they have also adopted the anarcho-capitalist notion that property owners have supreme authority over behavior in their spaces. The push for Title IX hearings on campus and the drive for censorship of ""offensive"" content right here on Reddit are excellent examples.   How many times have you seen statements like: ""Your so-called rights only have to be honored by the government. This is a private space. You have no rights here."" or ""That just means you can't be arrested. It doesn't mean there aren't consequences."" coming from the social justice fringe?  And of course, there is the seemingly religious dogma and evangelistic fervor. Social warriors even fling accusations of heresy and apostasy at other liberals. For the sin of not being liberal enough.  Now, I'm not saying that income and wealth inequality are not a thing, or not a problem. They are. But the solution doesn't lie with social justice warriors."

Basically, there is zero support for actually getting better, there is just a big echo chamber where people with problems tell each other that mental illnesses are a strenght that should be embraced and should not be treated. I wouldn't probably be wrong if I said that this mentality has already caused suicides.  And don't even get me started on the self-diagnosers and the toxic (fuck I hate that word) cults which form around narcissist people with nothing else wrong but their personalities. Those who use the whole social justice thing for their own agenda, the ones who love to blame their ""illnesses"" when they act like huge assholes, expecting that to relieve them of any responsibility.  I get it, some people can't get medical care and have to make do. But the suckers that shout that all doctors are ableist and you can only trust yourself and the internet when figuring out what is wrong... The whole idea is flawed to it's core. If you truly are mentally ill, you CAN'T make an objective analysis about the situation, because your thinking process is, well, in a disorder. And even if you could view yourself objectively, through magic or dimensional portals or something, you still couldn't do anything because you don't have the training required to actually diagnose those illnesses.  Psychiatrists actually study these things, they don't spend over five years high-fiving other able-bodied white upper class cishet males (probably gamers too, gross) in medical school and they definitely don't specialize in the field just to fuck with mentally ill people and laugh with other able-bodied white upper class cishet males in the backroom while sipping fine wine and thinking how stupid all those patients are."

My fiance has to deal with the nastiest, craziest mood swings; I say terrible things, I act like the worst cunt you could imagine.  Every time I self-destruct because of my mood disorder, I take responsibility for it. I can't totally control what I do when I have a swing, but I'll never stop trying to prevent them. When I come back to sanity, I take responsibility for the shit I said and did, I apologize and try to plan for the future so I won't repeat the same mistakes, hurt the people I love.  These fucking kids act like because they think they have a mental disorder, the world should bow and bend to them. They act like they're not responsible for anything, and should never be held accountable for their actions. They focus on yelling about people using ""abelist slurs"" like crazy/insane/delusional, but those of us who actually have a fucking chemical imbalance happily own the fact that we are crazy, insane, and delusional.  This is clearly something that really hits a note with me. The worst fucking part is that they've taken away the safety/security some of us felt about telling people we have mood disorders. I used to not be shy about admitting that I have bipolar disorder to people, even if I didn't know them well. It's the biggest defining characteristic of me, and since I'm medicated and working every day to get better, I didn't feel ashamed or anything to tell people. Now, I don't tell ANYONE; I'm not even sure if I'll submit this comment. Because why would anyone believe me? Having a mental illness is a tumblr thing, right? Everyone claims they have that shit. Even though they'll never go into detail about what they have to the degree that legitimately diagnosed people can (eg I have bipolar disorder type 2 with rapid swings; plz find me one person on tumblr who ever even acknowledges there are multiple classifications of bipolar disorder). I feel obligated to back up the announcement of my diagnosis by listing off the medications I take, just to prove I'm legit. I shouldn't have to feel compelled to do that, I shouldn't feel like everyone will think I'm a fraud, but thanks to tumblr, that's life now.  Sorry for the rant. I think about this a lot."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,adderalldependent,3,Thu Jul 2 00:21:44 2015 UTC,"Anxiety disorders have been so diluted by idiots claiming to have them who clearly don't that I've seen multiple reasonable people on tumblr question whether they're a real thing. Absolutely no one will genuinely take you seriously if you talk about it at this point, they may tisk in sympathy but they think either you're lying, it's just a trend not a debilitating range of mental illnesses, or that it just means you're shy."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,frumfrumfroo,2,Sat Jul 4 08:37:32 2015 UTC,"It is infuriating that they indeed cause problems for the rest of us to talk about our issues. Mainly this is what stops me talking about my bipolar (yay type 2 rapid delusional high five) to anyone but my most closest friends. And the internet, because I can control the anonymity level here.  It's not just tumblrinas, they are only the latest incarnation of this trend of blaming everything on mental illnesses. But goddamnit, they are the most annoying version I have seen to date."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,Spysnakez,5,Thu Jul 2 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"[They] never seem to consider that it is an illness aka something bad that should, if possible, be treated.   I've mentioned it before, but I've always been really confused by people who are against ""ableist language,"" which for them includes  any colloquial term that refers to mental illness. They don't seem to realize that ""crazy"" has a negative connotation because craziness is, y'know, undesirable, the same way that pain is. I think for a lot of people it may be identity politics gone overboard. No one gets offended when someone says ""Fuck cancer,"" or describes something as ""a cancer"" because no one thinks that cancer is a part of their ""identity."" But these people can't understand that an attack on mental illness is not an attack on them personally, and that people can support mentally ill people while shit-talking their conditions, or just using them as an innocent metaphor."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,wastingtime14,2,Wed Jul 1 16:43:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but since our minds/brains are...who we are, I can see where mental illness becomes a large part of an identity. Many mental illnesses are thought to be a spectrum with quirky personalities on one end and full blown mental illness on the other. So I can see where identity, already being wrapped up with things like personality and how one behaves, can also be wrapped up with mental disorders. Even when being treated it's kind of hard to define a ""baseline,"" like is this person acting/thinking what is normal for them or is it due to the medication they are taking?  Having said that, I think that far more than ableist language or colloquial terms , self diagnosis and misrepresentation of mental illnesses hurts people with actual mental illnesses the most."

TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,CoMaBlaCK,2,Thu Jul 2 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"This isn't so much an sjw thing as it is a human thing. I've seen people from all walks of life self diagnose themselves and blame behavior on illnesses they believe they have.  The problem I have with sjws is their desire to be mentally ill. As humans we should strive to be better, glorifying mental illness is a step backwards."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,EmptyEmptyInsides,3,Wed Jul 1 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're kind of overgeneralizing some Tumblr groups to SJWs at large, which extend far beyond Tumblr and don't really seem especially bigger into self-DXing than anyone else is (same thing with promoting otherkin, or even HAES for that matter, even if these subgroups happen to also often include SJWs)  Is using mental illness as an excuse for bad behavior really that common either? I know there was that recent post where someone excused death threats as being the product of a PTSD event, but I couldn't find any actual traces of this post on google, and there were some people claiming it was a troll.  The biggest issue I see with SJWs and mental illness is if you try to use it in any way as a contributor to someone's terrible actions instead of purely external factors like the patriarchy promoting sexism and racism. What I've seen is SJWs make the claim that considering mental illness as a contributor to atrocity stigmatizes all people with mental illness, even though I never see anyone saying that all or even more than a small number of conditions can contribute to violence, nor that they will for more than a small number of individuals diagnosed with it. I think the issue is with referring to ""mental illness"" generally instead of a any specific condition, but of course people do that simply because they don't want to try to diagnose people."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,frumfrumfroo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:30:23 2015 UTC,"I have seen posts virulently defending and even advocating for self-diagnosis on mental health support blogs, defining the reason its validity cannot be questioned as a social justice issue. Doctors and/or the DSM is ~phobic, telling people to get professional help is classicist (because of US healthcare) or ableist, no one has my experiences or can understand me but me, etc.  I've also encountered a huge number of tumblr SJWs who scream at people and will use mental illness as a shield if anyone tries to engage them. It's the reason their behaviour should not be criticised, no overreaction or misinterpretation is their fault, and other people can only speak to them at all on very specific terms. The attitude is overwhelmingly that everyone should change to accommodate them rather than that they should try to get better. The very suggestion that getting better is possible is offensive to some of these people.  It's common enough that I felt incredibly uncomfortable telling someone that my MH issues get in the way, because it was like I was acting like these disingenuous drama queens and making excuses."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,EmptyEmptyInsides,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:25:10 2015 UTC,"Fair call on that first bit. I wasn't quite sure how to word that part of tumblr - the otherkins, the headmates, the ""everything is ableism"", the ""everything triggers my PTSD"". Tumblr seemed like the best generalisation since they are the ones who consistently provide the blog evidence (and this is TiA).   The main ones that come to mind with using it as an excuse would be the headmates. I dunno, I get the impression that there are circles that see any form of addressing the illness is really just ***normative. Is there a word yet? neurotypicalnormative? The illness is worn as a badge of pride, and not something that should be changed..."
TiADiscussion,3bq3ya,ANONYMOOSE_111,0,Wed Jul 1 07:04:59 2015 UTC,"Headmates are interesting. I haven't read much from Tumblr on this, but I'm going to assume this is the same thing as Tulpas, which I've read a bit about on websites and r/Tulpas. Tulpas seem to be deliberately created split personalities, that can manifest as very distinct and real. That's not exactly the same as split personalities that arise from a pre-existing condition like DID, and from what I've heard the Tulpa community strongly suggests that people with DID don't engage in it.  If this is what headmates are I don't think I'd necessarily consider them a symptom of mental illness, or their creation an attempt to make oneself mentally ill. I do suspect that a lot of people who make them are very lonely, and while I've heard claims that therapists and psychiatrists have endorsed it as a healthy coping mechanism I'm not completely convinced. But a lot of that is just having a hard time understanding something that is so unintuitive and counter to how we think our minds normally work - but that by itself doesn't necessarily make it wrong or bad."

Opposing homophobia is a good idea, but in an echo chamber it becomes a bad idea where all hetero people are now homophobes. Same with opposing transphobia. And when somebody says ""hey guys, there's no reason to hate all cishets"", then somebody inevitably accuses that person of internalized prejudice.

TiADiscussion,3bmsr0,notatallexpected,25,Wed Jul 1 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"Prejudice is prejudice and I don't see why someone can't have prejudice against a group they're part of. Like lots of feminist men have today. But I'd say internalized prejudice is a poor name for it. Internalized implies something that has become ingrained in a person's thought processes/personality/subconscious. Probably most prejudice is internalized to some degree. It seems like ""internal"" is being used to refer to a group over the individual which is kind of a chilling reflection of identity politics.  Claims of internalized-prejudice are also very often used to negate someone's experiences or perspective. You think you've never been sexually harassed or oppressed? Must have internalized misogyny. That kind of thing. The other issue is that in making things like sexism, racism, and so on require societal institutions and standards it has left the personal element of prejudice behind. So people are said to have internalized racism if anything they say or do supports the ""institution"" of racism or stands in the way of someone's attempts at anti-racism, regardless of whether or not that person has any kind of prejudice. So yeah, I think the term is poorly constructed and often misleading and dangerous, on top of not really very useful.  Note that hating some attribute about yourself doesn't necessarily make you prejudiced against people who have that attribute."
TiADiscussion,3bmsr0,CHR1571,7,Tue Jun 30 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"True, especially the part about how most prejudice is internalized to some extent, whether it's against your own group or against the other. How could one be racist if they haven't internalized racist values?   You think you've never been sexually harassed or oppressed? Must have internalized misogyny.    That's referred to as ""negating someone's experiences."" It's when someone else tries to say that they know your own life experiences better than you do. It can come from either side of a discussion."
TiADiscussion,3bmsr0,thisisanalt3,4,Tue Jun 30 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"It does exist, I think. For example, Muslim women who hold such extremely reactionary views that they willingly join a group like ISIS, probably have ""internalized misogyny"" to some extent.

TiADiscussion,3bmsr0,Lowbacca1977,2,Tue Jun 30 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"I tend to think of prejudices as stories, narratives that serve as simplified explanations of the world.  I remember reading Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali and was struck by the clan system found in Somalia, each clan has traits associated with them like stubborness and this becomes adopted by the clans, they live the stereotype.  In this way stereotypes (that aren't explicitly and exclusively negative) are often adopted by those they would apply to as a sort of identity, a person of Irish descent who drinks a lot because he's Irish for example.  The extent to which this is a real problem depends on which stereotype is being adopted, but I suspect this is a behaviour that is more or less intrinsic to human nature, we all seem to want an identity, and invent it along the way to greater or lesser extents. Everyone is prejudiced, even against themselves, perhaps even especially against themselves. It's part of being human.   I find that incredibly condescending to assume if someone disagrees with SJW views that it's because they have internalized prejudices as opposed to thinking for themselves and coming to their own conclusion.   It's more than condescension, it's pseudo intellectual snobbery and it reflects the rigidity and dogmatism that plagues their minds. ""For there is only one path away from our glorious truth, and it is that of self hatred, nothing save that could lead you astray.""

TiADiscussion,3bhmpg,robeph,11,Mon Jun 29 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"See, this is a common misconception.  Tumblr is rife with all sorts of subcultures,  it is not,  however,  a segmented entity, like reddit with subreddits.  Instead you have a web of crosslinks and this and that.  I mean there's stuff on there that doesn't see the light of day.   Problem is,  the web formation of notes/reposting etc,  create what amounts to a single site version of the older webrings,   where each site had other sites linked too with similar content.   Except this allows for exponential growth as followers of followers of followers tack on to each.   Making loud voices much louder.   You'll find plenty there completely distanced from these,  but they're not clearly obvious with the loud voice of the SJW radical whackadoos."

I've got acquaintances tell me I was appropriating the Korean culture because I ate Korean food (that my mother made and gave to me???) while they regularly spoke English sentences sprinkled with Japanese words.

Well, maybe not SJW (though I used to post in the Fempire), but this was back in the good old days where we were all stridently leftist, progressive people who thought conservatives were mouthbreathing, deluded, morons. Then came Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlie Hebdo, ISIS, GamerGate, UVa Hoax, Mattress Girl, etc, and we realized the Left could be just as doctrinaire, narrative-pushing, and willfully ignorant as the Right.  On the whole, I'm fine with people on the Left, but I'm annoyed at people on either side who are insane fanatics. I'm not going to befriend someone who says gay people are icky or blathers on about how immigrants and Muslims are imps of Satan. But I'm also not going to befriend anyone who says we should ""listen and believe"" and accept mere accusations as proof of crimes, or justifies wanton rioting as some sort of ennobled ""uprising.""  I threw out some of my leftist friends over the past year or so, and I don't regret it. Anyone who accepts the lies of ideologues on either side of the political spectrum adds nothing to my life.

As the old-school feminists suggested, gender just shouldn't be such a big deal. From a bird's eye view, it's pretty crazy that people get so obsessed with matching sex and gender. There's just nothing e en remotely wrong with a girl or woman acting or dressing as boys or men usually do, nor with a boy or man acting or dressing as girls or women usually do.  The trendy theory, now a strictly-enforced orthodoxy on TiA, is, to cut to the chase, that gender is extremely important and that e.g. acting/dressing like women conventionally do can literally make you a woman.  The  true and more enlightened view seems to me to be the old feminist view, however: gender is superficial and largely conventional. So dressing like women normally do doesn't make you a woman. The point is to see how relatively unimportant gender really is, not to buy into the blinkered view that gender is of crucial importance."
TiADiscussion,3bjsn0,MosDaf,7,Tue Jun 30 12:34:47 2015 UTC,acting/dressing like women conventionally do can literally make you a woman   I think you have a skewed concept of what being transgender is.

There are people out there that don't separate what they feel from what they think and give them the exact same merit in conversation. The way I feel and the way I think can be totally different things because one is rational and the other is not. I try and separate them and be clear about them the best I know how, this is the only responsible way to handle it. Feel your feelings and think your thoughts but recognize that they are not the same."
TiADiscussion,3bh8pd,bluescape,3,Mon Jun 29 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"There are people out there that don't separate what they feel from what they think and give them the exact same merit in conversation.   That seems to be because they don't spend much time in introspection. ""Smartness"" seems to appear in different forms (or at the very least in my experience people which appear smart).    At the lowest level there seems to be the ability to regurgitate information.  Unfortunately this is where the bar is set in our educational system.  Can you remember this stuff?  Good, you get A's, you are ""smart"".  By such a metric though, Google is incredibly smart.  Typically when people get in high school or college, they start questioning all that information that was stuffed in their heads, but unfortunately they usually go about it in an emotional sense and tend only tend to agree with what feels right without really fact checking.  This is why things like Supersize Me get taken in as fact, when in actuality no one could recreate his results.  It's also why things like the ""1 in 4 women will be sexually assaulted"" study can just get churned out and taken as gospel.  I've found that for the most part, when people mature as intellectuals, this is typically the stop they get off at.  This seems to make things worse as people now believe they have researched and therefore their opinion is informed and therefor they can be indignant about being questioned when in actuality they've laid no such well researched foundation.  The highest level I've come across, is the idea that a person doesn't know, that they could be wrong, but that this is the best opinion they can make based on the information they have.  In addition to this mindset, it's absolutely important that people know how to research which is also often times where people come up short (as I said, they typically just go with whatever feels good).  It's also important to know how to think critically.  For instance going back to the 1 in 4 sexual assault study, while it was from someone with credentials, upon reading the study you find that her definition of sexual assault is pretty broad, and her sample size for her information is rather small as well as rather skewed.  Of course you can only know that if you read the study and have some grasp as to why the information is bunk.  Unfortunately this level of scrutiny also takes the most time, and it's often time the average person can't/won't commit, and once again we end up in the feels zone.  At this point I think I'm just rambling, and it's even more complex than my few paragraphs really illustrate, but I think you get the gist of what I'm trying to get at."
TiADiscussion,3bh8pd,MosDaf,5,Wed Jul 1 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I disagreed with Hitchens about a lot of things...but he seemed to be basically the kind of guy who is ok with people disagreeing with him on reasonable grounds. Though, again, I disagreed with the guy a fair bit, I really like a lot of things about his attitudes, and he serves as a reminder that you don't have to toe the liberal line on everything to be smart and reasonable and admirable. In fact, as you move left on the spectrum, away from more centrist liberalism toward more left-liberalism, and then on to illiberal leftist views, you encounter those who are just as brainlessly pious as the most dogmatic extreme conservative. IMO, liberals in general are terrible at recognizing how bad and unreasonable and illiberal such people are. Hitchens, however--like Orwell--was not subject to that illusion. And that's really my biggest complaint about the neo-PCs / SJWs--they're radical, illiberal, irrationalist leftist dogmatists. They've got what's basically a secular religion, complete with their own various versions of original sin...inherited collective guilt for something that happened before our birth. Everyone is born in sin becomes, for example, everybody's racist, and so on. Liberals used to be the iconoclasts, poking and prodding and questioning and making fun of hollow pieties.. But whenever the illiberal left kicks up its heels, as it did with the PCs in the '80's and '90's, ""liberalism"" becomes less liberal and starts looking more like some kind of wacky cult, with its shibboleths, and awe-struck attachment to a new terminology, its intolerance of dissent, its eagerness for public shaming, confession of sins, etc. Yeah, Hitchens would shred these morons, as he shredded the PCs."

The states were not in any similar situation to the colonies of the British Empire. They all willingly joined (or were founding members) of the United States. Some confederate states like Texas had a war fought over them specifically so they would be a part of the US. They also had voting rights in Congress and got some amount of money back in tax-paid infrastructure, mail, and military defense.  Congress had been more than accommodating to slavery, agreeing to let the South keep whatever slaves it already had in 1808 and their descendents, then allowing all states south of 36 30' to keep slaves, and letting places like Kansas and West Virginia decide slavery for themselves. South Carolina, though, decided to panic as soon as they knew a Republican would take office because muh states rights, so they seceded before Lincoln even took office and got the other southern states to join them. Lincoln didn't really want to abolish slavery in 1861 and if the war hadn't happened, he probably wouldn't have, but the South pushed him into fighting back by making the US capital city border a different nation of malcontents, by firing back on US troops sent to maintain order in the newly seceded Virginia, and by tearing a union that worked better than the sum of its parts to pieces."

Think about it: Why is the swastika still shocking? Well, because it was put in a box very quickly and banned outright in the places where it had the most impact.  If you look back and consider what actually did the most legwork to take power away from the swastika, it wasn't taking it down... it was the American cartoons making fun of Hitler. It was Mel Brooks messing with it in the The Producers. It was the Sex Pistols and Siouxsie Sioux wearing it to decontextualize it and make fun of the very idea of a symbol having power.  We don't operate with that language anymore, and that's the issue with the Confederate Flag. It simply hasn't been mocked enough to be put to bed yet; as it is, doing so would only serve to superheat the hate of people who believe in it. We have to keep it around long enough to neuter it of its power through utter mockery, and a lot of the big moral statements about how evil it is actually work against that goal."

The whole point is that moral fervor makes this task no easier, nor does it make you more correct than you were to begin with. And you were correct to begin with, but being unable to see the bigger picture makes that correctness functionally useless. The only power being correct gives you is the very minuscule power of a single tiny little vote that might not even get a chance to be counted.  Of course it shouldn't be on government buildings. Duh. But believing that is not mutually exclusive to addressing the potential fallout of its removal. If you want to be anything more than a voice disappearing into the crowd, consider more than just right and wrong. Why not try and figure out how to make the world a better place? Hint: You can't do it just by being morally correct.  You have to be prepared to consider the conundrum that fervently tearing down the Confederate Flag is going to reawaken people to its power. What happens when paranoid rednecks feel threatened? Well, I'll tell you, it's a hell of a lot worse than what happens when internet intellectuals/pseudo-intellectuals feel threatened. So if the choices you're given are, ""Tear down that oppressive symbol, with the risk of reawakening the violent racism lying dormant in the south"" or ""Accept the status quo but find a more subversive way to help eliminate its power,"" then what are you going to choose? I'm not saying those are the only options -- I can't know. You can't know. But if it's something you refuse to think about, I can't respect that. I can't help but consider the personal benefit you get from the more dangerous option (that is, the satisfying-but-illusory dopamine rush of self-righteous anger). We all like to think about doing our part to make the world a better place, but sometimes that means developing the capacity to think more critically, without pride, to outsmart the opposition. I can tell you, because I live here: If a southerner's weakness is anything, it's his intellect. Why challenge him in terms of righteous moral passion? He has the home-field advantage in that game."
TiADiscussion,3bg0wu,TheDefinitionOfSmug,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"Nothing about my position changed from one comment to the next, and nowhere have I said I want to ""tear down"" all confederate flags anywhere but government buildings.  My actual position is that it has no place anywhere on any government property outside a museum, and that the opinions of people wearing it proudly should matter about as much as people wearing a swastika proudly. You can wear it if you want, but you're wearing the symbol of slavery, and I am unconcerned about any reactionary outrage that may result from taking off the capitol building."
TiADiscussion,3bg0wu,ArchangelleDovakin,2,Mon Jun 29 03:42:45 2015 UTC,"I understand your position perfectly well. Yes, ""tear down"" was my choice of words, and it's not an implication of scope; colloquially speaking, to ""tear down"" a flag, do you have to remove more than one? Do you have to do it on private property? No. ""Tear down"" means to remove it with moralistic passion because of how wrong it is, which is precisely the mindset you're expressing.  I don't believe in it on public or private property, and that's why I think it merits a more planned approach -- because, like you, I don't believe in forcing it off private property, but I also realize my belief isn't going to undermine anyone and I hope to find a solution which effectively discourages its use privately without infringing upon the right to expression. Personally, taking it off public buildings only for it to resurge in private is not enough for me. The fact that it's not as deeply stigmatized as the swastika is precisely why we need to be taking a more in-depth look at how to sever its power.  If simply stating a position is enough for you, and you don't mind the possibility that stating that position makes no difference whatsoever, well... I can't force you to think harder about it. But neither can I see it as having any merit."
TiADiscussion,3bg0wu,vvarden,-4,Mon Jun 29 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"I think you are overstating the number of people who are going to put it up in response to removing it from the capitol if they didn't already have it up anyway. They may put up an extra one, they might buy another flag shirt, and I say let em, but the more important metric being the number of people is unlikely to move in significant measure.

If you do, then I don't know what wonderful pocket you've found, because the only thing stopping people around here is the fact that they can't get one at Wal-Mart. I've already seen the numbers go up. Besides, it doesn't have to affect some massive widespread blob to matter -- all it takes is one extremist to be pushed too far. Sure, that extremist is responsible for his actions, but those actions still occur and are still tragic. Even goddamn Y.A. lit can communicate the philosophy that, for a given group who is not in power, the dormant hope of some far-off future day when they can finally rise up is often the very thing which prevents them from rising up today. The hope of a better opportunity is what prevents them from risking it on a shitty opportunity. But if you remove that hope, people feel shafted and are more willing to take that risk. And yeah, that's Y.A. lit, but like I said... all it takes is one to cause a tragedy.  Anyway, I'm saying it should undermine people. I'm not sensitive to their feelings... It's what they'll do with those feelings that I worry about. This is a pretty bare-bones example, but to me, before forcing the issue of taking it down, wouldn't it be more effective to start a street art campaign to plaster it everywhere... except with dicks and kittens in the center? OK, maybe not dicks, because that limits the accepting audience, but kittens still work. What if the gayest parade you've ever seen marched through a (safe, but appropriate) southern town with confederate flags instead of rainbows? I'm pretty much serious about this. Satire is one of the more powerful things nowadays; first it was a generation of kids learning everything they know about politics from the Daily Show and Colbert, and now look at the sociopolitical pull of John Oliver -- his show helped net neutrality pass, his show put attention on FIFA sponsors who then pulled their support... and yet, somehow, even he staked the flag debate on the morality of it.  That said, I'm not saying there's no moral message to be used. I'm just saying it's a much more complex problem, and it takes a lot more than that to really work. It takes a whole culture, doing what cultures do, not simply getting into the bland mathematical politics of it."
TiADiscussion,3bg0wu,vvarden,-6,Mon Jun 29 04:29:19 2015 UTC,I honestly don't get where you're coming up with this notion that using the flag in a satirical or cartoonish manner is going to convince anyone to take the flag off the capitol who doesn't already think it shouldn't be there in the first place.

Nobody knows anything precisely, but the least you can do is consider all the possibilities. At this point in time, we're not the people sitting on the committees and organizations who are making these decisions, which means we can have free and open discussion about the absolute depths of human possibility, and yet we so rarely take advantage of that -- we just favor making big moralistic platitudes. Platitudes which are, of course, correct, but that doesn't mean we're getting anything done by saying them.  I'm sorry, but maybe your confusion comes from the fact that I'm not actively trying to show how angry I am about how evil the flag is. Well... so what? I still want it gone. ""Doing the right thing"" can be done many different ways, and often it has to be done many different ways to get done at all. You can also ""do the right thing"" the wrong way; this insistence on not only wanting the flag removed, but also wanting to be able to say ""URRRGHHH THESE FLAG SUPPORTERS, THEY'RE ALL SUPPORTING SLAVERY AND OPPRESSION! WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WHAT'S WHAT!"" is so fucking adolescent, I can't even tell you. If people would start acting like adults about it, and if just a few people would think it through more cleverly, they would get this shit done so much faster.  There's just this blindness people like yourself and the other poster have to negative byproducts, where you say, ""Well, there's no way to know."" Well, read some goddamn Jung and Chomsky and get back to me. The left has always been best off getting things done by undermining regressive mass behavior... not by engaging in it. In all issues except the direst and most literal of human rights (that is, not symbols' relation to civil rights), it's always achieved the most with a less threatening ""peace and fun for everybody"" approach. The fact that progress is still being made nowadays does NOT mean that it's moving as fast as it could, nor does it mean we won't pay the price for it during this next election or the one that follows. For the last goddamn time: I'm not saying these progressive goals shouldn't be pursued. I'm saying there's a way to accomplish them AND minimize the swinging of the anger-pendulum toward the right because that pendulum always comes back and screws us in retaliation. I'm saying they should be approached using our strengths to their maximum potential, and our strengths are not in yelling about things -- they're in strategy. They're in cultural ideas. Progressive ideology has a monopoly on so many modes of thought with so much potential to be used in clever roundabout ways (entertainment, educators, all sorts of tertiary initiatives which benefit the huge population of American poor and could be leveraged for their support), and yet its constituents are beginning to take the same direct, moralistic approach as the right used to have -- and that approach is what caused Bush to live in infamy, and lost the Republicans the last two elections.  By the way, I'm a southerner. Is it supposed to be offensive to say southerners run more on their passions than on complex ideas? Because in my experience, the sort of southerners who stand in the way of solving these problems are pretty much the ones who would voluntarily confirm that that's their mindset. It's incredibly ironic to me that, when I highlight a southern weakness which if properly leveraged could actually make strides in eliminating the flag we both want gone... you find a way to call that hypocrisy on my part. Who cares? It's a piece of the puzzle. I can go fuck myself with my hypocrisy. I'm nobody. The point is to try and find where that puzzle piece goes. You can choose not to believe it, but you're not doing yourself any favors. The numbers are what they are, offensive or not, and those are the numbers here."

TiADiscussion,3be6nj,iribrise,11,Sun Jun 28 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't engage with your friend too deeply on this for a start, because we see again and again SJW's etc trying to draw people into some kind of debate that they're not interested in.  This new interpretation of the flag as some kind of 'identity flag' is entirely new, entirely unprecedented and pointless.  People usually show the flag to say that they're happy with the progress being achieved for LGBT people, and that's the correct thing to do.   .  If you are personally celebrating this then there's no issue, if people don't show solidarity then all we have are SJW's spilling there hate, and on the other side a group of people complaining that 'gay marriage is evil', which the SJW's will then extrapolate to mean all people other than them feel, because this feeds their narrative.  .  So to answer your questions explicitly.    what do I even say to this?   Don't respond, or if you must be brief in your rebuttal and don't engage any further on this subject at all, that's the only way to manage this.   What does she?    She has nothing to say on this issue. And she doesn't really care either.   Why the hell do people think like this?   Because when people have a narrative and have this 'victim' power (by which I mean SJW's not LGBT people), they're afraid to give it up.  This is another issue they can't keep going on about, yesterday they were worried about the pay of Chairman Pao, today they're concerned about poor black people who still face discrimination by saying that gay marriage is only for rich gay men.  There is no argument, the goal posts always change, you can only win by being yourself, and not engaging with this."

Not any of my friends, but definitely some on other social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr. I would also expect real-life SJWs that I know to insist that everyone changes their profile picture, given how much they're into symbolism and how they think everyone who doesn't do everything they do is against them and everything they stand for.  But then again, when have SJWs been known for their consistency and logic?  As for me, I avoid making explicitly political statements using Facebook just because I don't like following the crowd (even if the crowd is doing something good, like on Friday), which, as I can see, can get riled up over something as inane as the color of a dress or dumping icy water on their own heads (this doesn't extend to anyone who actually donated).  That being said, I have absolutely no problem with those who made any kind of positive statement on Friday, and indeed am elated that the SJWs I know took a day off from incessantly whining to say something ""positive"" (by that I mean mocking actual bigots for once and changing their profile pictures)."

Some of the threats have allegedly involved photos taken outside their home or similar signs that the person knows exactly where to find you.

Been about five years since the last one and I'm still rolling right along.  There are lots of squealing idiots on the internet. That said, the ones who were persistent about such things I tracked down as they weren't smart enough to hide their IPs and other details to make vague insinuations as to where and who they were to get them to go the hell away before I called the cops on them. That said, the threats were delivered to places I administrated so I could pull such shenanigans. Social media makes that much more difficult.  I've considered offering to help a few of the people who get these things as unless they're dealing with non-idiots I can probably run them down, but the effort is rather trivial in most cases as at least one person on twitter has already proved by calling some idiots mother on him. But really, I have little doubt they've received threats and in their mind sets they will be readily intimidated by them. This generally leads the idiots to think it'll work on anyone, which rather quickly gets them burned when they hit the wrong person. At the same time, some have either been faked by them, or sent by a third party to deliberately start shit(I may or may not be glaring at the chans right now), and there's been actual evidence of that chicanery too."

Basically what ""girlfags"" are is super yaoi fangirls who take that shit over into real life. They are touchy, obsessive, inappropriate, and all around disgusting. They would hit on gay men and ask them gross, inappropriate questions about their sex lives, and eventually the gay guys on tumblr got sick of it and went ""Hey, cut that shit out, it's making us really uncomfortable.""  As expected, the spoiled little rich bitch shits on Tumblr lost their minds because how dare someone tell them no?!  So then came the whole ""Gay men are super misogynistic and sexist because they won't fuck girls"" thing, followed by a flood of ""They're super privileged because they make more money than girls and there's two of them"".   It's fucking ridiculous, and it all started because gay guys didn't want women all up in their sex life, and it's very similar to what happened with trans men.   Just a little over a year ago, Tumblr was all about trans men, but it was in a weird, sexually aggressive way with lots of use of the word ""boycunt"" and it made trans men understandably uncomfortable, and they were like ""hey, no, stop. Thats gross and offensive and really, really demeaning and creepy"", to which the spoiled brats on tumblr responded ""FUCK YOU YOU FREINDZONING BITCHES"". Fast forward to now, and they have this narrative where they claim trans men are violent and predatory, because trans men told them to stop being predatory and they can't stand being told no."

Now, I'm no prude, I have no problem talking about my sex life with my close friends but I barely knew her. It was weird.   I could have maybe understood it if she was a young teenager but she was fucking 22. My friend told me she would ask him all about me and shoehorn her way into hanging out with us. I tried talking to her and letting her know how she was acting wasn't cool but it flew over her head. I even got that great speech every bisexual man seems to get about how it's 2007 and I don't have to ""pretend"" and I can just be gay.   Then another one of my friends found her livejournal and on there were a bunch of stories she wrote with me and various fictional characters in a multitude of sex acts. It was really creepy and weirded me out. And apparently fictional me takes a fisting rather easily."

The guys can't help it that they aren't attracted to women, otherwise they probably wouldn't put up with all the social difficulties inherent in being homosexual. I hate to speak in absolute terms, so I will say that maybe a  subset of them can actively alter their sexual proclivities, but if those people exist, they are profoundly small in number.

I believe people think that the scale was meant as some sort of slider, like in character creation in Skyrim, and you could scroll it up or down to the desired sexuality. As someone who was once very distraught with my own sexuality, it's actually an affront that people say this.

I'm not going to assume you are straight, or gay, but if you are straight, then it'd probably have no bearing on you because you weren't being treated like a lesser citizen. But to people in the LGBT community, it really is an important issue. Because there are still so many problems in the country that LGBT people face that each battle has to be fought tooth and nail for.  Marriage was but one of those battles. But did you know that there are still many places in the country where LGBT individuals can be denied service at restaurants and businesses? How about how some states can legally refuse to rent out or house LGBT people, and in fact will evict them if they find out after the fact. How about workplace discrimination? And that of ALL homeless youth, LGBT teens make up a vast amount of that number.  Don't get me wrong, I find the NSA spying scandal reprehensible, and tax evading corporations are the scum of the earth... but it is a wee bit callous to say that an IMMENSELY important win for the LGBT community isn't important."

At what point does a group become so uncommon that no one's bothered to discriminate against them?   The word ""fringe"" could mean groups with perfectly valid concerns which are simply not discussed in the mainstream, or groups which are actually wrong and on the fringe for a good reason. I'd be cool with the first, not the second.    (For example, what makes the LGBT community worth fighting for but not the queer/questioning, intersex and asexual, or QIA+ communities?)   Think about what the goals of each of those communities might be. Queer is a somewhat political catchall term. Questioning essentially means you might be LGBT but maybe not, so they largely deal with the same issues. Intersex people have completely different concerns which are also valid, the main one being to prevent unnecessary cosmetic surgery on infants. Asexual people mainly want people to be aware that they exist and are not some kind of pathology."
TiADiscussion,3ba2a4,notatallexpected,2,Sat Jun 27 07:19:10 2015 UTC,"I mainly asked the question about being ""fringe"" because I've seen the opinion floating around that because trans people only make up some 0.3% of the population as opposed to, say, 3% for LGB folks, there's less need of a push to help them. So to these people, from a population standpoint, if the group comprises of less than an LGB-percentage of people, the group becomes too rare to care about... as much. Same goes for the QIA+ groups.  I think I can somewhat understand that viewpoint, especially since being trans is extremely complicated compared to being gay. Understanding trans issues beyond the surface would require people to educate themselves, which most are too lazy to do. Most can understand what it's like to be sexually attracted to someone, or why it's wrong to treat someone differently based on skin color. But that relatability doesn't really exist for trans/cis or intersex/not intersex people, which makes it more difficult for average person to care as much without some research."

With Trans however, it's become a social, financial, and a medical issue to where there's a lot of public money that has to be thrown at it. From lifelong therapy, to drugs, to plastic surgery, to SRS, there's way more money on the line for this minority group."

We got rid of the death penalty a long time ago, but we brought it back to execute people who conspired with nazis, then we outlawed it again. We're are part of NATO, and participate in most military adventures, so I wouldn't say there's a difference there.   A major characteristic of Dutch culture I think is that much more feminine whereas American culture is more masculine. The Dutch value cooperation over competition, we think rehabilitation is more important than punishment, and out political system is based on party leadership cooperating and negotiating. Also a big difference is how little Americans care about being happy. We have effective equality between the sexes, which has lead to most women working part-time, because they value happiness over success.  Sorry for the rant, but as for your question, I would say we care more about quality of life than Americans. So we have more expansive social programs, we take more vacation than anyone else in the world, and we want people who are suffering to have the option to stop the suffering."

For another, Polygamy would inevitably lead to wealthy, high-status men accruing large numbers of wives. This creates a large number of de facto surplus men, which poses problems to a society. A lot of people who supported gay marriage on consequentialist grounds (like me) did so because we saw large benefits from extending marriage rights with few if any problems. Extending marriage to include polyamory has much more limited benefits, and strong negative consequences.   I think the support for it among Americans at large would be anemic at best."

TiADiscussion,3b9v9z,oversoul00,6,Sat Jun 27 07:11:20 2015 UTC,"About 6 months ago is when I started getting this side of the argument  I feel this is strongly showing through the race discussion   Was it Ferguson? I really started to notice, starting with Trayvon Martin but really starting in earnest with Ferguson, a much more polarized conversation on race in the US. I can empathize with the feeling of not being able to disagree- I got dirty looks and snide remarks for even suggesting the idea that the court rulings weren't off the mark and might have been because of a genuine lack of solid proof that the police (or a cop wanna-be, in the case of Zimmerman) murdered the guys.   It makes me just want to bow out from all discussions which will then get some of them angry at me because ""I can afford to ignore it"" and it just feels like it's useless arguing.   That's what I call the ""you can't be neutral on a moving train"" mentality, popularized by Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States (good read if you want a socialist/SJW-ish perspective on US history, but incredibly biased, which Zinn admits to), in which silence or not saying anything is siding with the oppressor because 1. since the oppressor is dominant, there needs to be loud voices from everyone to overthrow the tyranny, and 2. non-marginalized populations, according to them, have the virtue of not having to care because the issue doesn't affect them, while with marginalized groups those same issues affect their daily lives. At school I try to fend them off with excuses (exams coming up, too busy, want to stay off of social media for a while), but the best thing to do is to bow out, at least on social media. If necessary, cut out your activity on social media so they forget that you exist. In real life circumstances, try to stay away from SJWs if you can if you're going to be talking about controversial stuff. Only talk about political issues in the company of people that you trust. (Ironically, that will mean that the SJWs are causing non-SJWs to create ""safe spaces"" for themselves to talk about political issues in a less polarized manner. TiAD is a great example of that, and it's great.)  In my case, I cut my FB activity to a minimum (I only use it to message people and to post about major personal life events) to keep a low profile. I also tend to go about my business at school, without causing fuss or bother, and generally look like the average student. So basically, I did ""bow out"" of all discussions, and it's done wonders for my sanity.   I just wish I could have a thought that won't get people close to me upset because I said the wrong thing at one point. It's just a landmine and I just don't want to treat people like garbage, is that so hard?    Well, I'll say this: someone who very easily thinks others are treating him/her as garbage is very inclined to treat others as garbage, simply because they'll be so suspicious of everything you say. I honestly don't think they're worth being friends with. It's a shame, especially if they weren't SJWs when you first became friends, but for the sake of your sanity, I would suggest finding new friends- look for those that have a more laid-back disposition (no guarantees though; SJWs can come in all shapes and forms, all majors represented, interests, etc.). You'll find that good friends aren't as quick to pounce on small mistakes, and if what you said is actually offensive, try to walk you through it and make you understand why, in a manner that is respectful to you.  PM me if you want to ask me more questions or reveal any info that you don't want public."

What I saw was on my Facebook feed was SJW (I unfollowed them earlier but specifically checked their accounts to see what they posted) and non-SJW alike celebrating the decision, with the SJWs perhaps being more mocking of the bigots rather than purely expressing happiness (not that I disagree with the SJWs there, but the SJWs I know were more likely to say stuff like ""suck it homophobes"" or ""let the unfriending begin"" vs. the non-SJW ""so happy that love wins""). My only thought on that was ""well, even they can spend a day being happy about something, in their own way"". I didn't end up posting anything spectacular or change my profile picture to rainbows, because I tend not to share much on FB outside of personal life events and because I have a natural aversion to ""following the crowd"" on social media, even if I know the crowd is not doing anything bad or anything that makes me uncomfortable, because in the end most social media storms, like the dress color, the ice bucket challenge, etc. are merely fads and people will go back to their lives.

TiADiscussion,3b7azl,crackyJsquirrel,3,Fri Jun 26 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"I'm very pleased with this decision. But I've seen a lot of comments mocking Scalia for being mega salty in his dissent. I haven't read much of it but this part stuck out to me, because I unexpectedly found myself agreeing with it:  ""If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: 'The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,' I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."" - Scalia   I find the opening passage he quotes extremely wishy washy. The Supreme Court's job is to interpret and uphold the Constitution, and I believe they did so correctly. But is it really their job to start talking about the power of love, or how the Constitution gives the right to ""define and express identity""? Is that in the Constitution? Is that relevant to gay marriage? It strikes me as the liberal judges getting overly caught up in their decisive victory in a very long running culture war.  Bans on gay marriage, ""abridged privileges and immunities"" of millions of American Citizens, violating the Fourteenth Amendment. That is why SCOTUS was right today, not because love is good."
TiADiscussion,3b7azl,punkbrad7,6,Fri Jun 26 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"Reading the opinions, I have three main reactions to this.   It's good to have marriage equality. It was a long time coming. I'm not quite comfortable with the way we achieved it. I agree with the dissenters that the Court overreached, although I don't think it's quite as dire as Scalia made it out to be. A federal law would have been more appropriate. I share Alito's reservation that the decision emphasizes the pair bonding aspect of marriage rather than the stable environment for raising children aspect. It seems to me that is the one the government should be interested in. Note that this isn't an argument against same-sex marriage, since they can procreate (through surrogates/sperm donors) or adopt like any other couple."

TiADiscussion,3b7azl,eyeballfrog,3,Fri Jun 26 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"People think it is overreach because they think it should have been left to the states to figure out democratically. But personally I think it went exactly how the conservative right made it happen. When two sides debate the issues, some states make it legal, some states do not, some states go as far as making specific laws to allow people to discriminate based on religious reasons. When the opposition creates these situations, people will start to go to court and challenge the anti-laws for their constitutionality. Then at some point these cases are going to make their way up to the SCOTUS. And when that happens they can easily show the constitutionality of allowing same sex marriage and boom, they change the landscape. It didn't have to come to this, but the side opposing forced it there in my opinion."

My only problem with this is that 5 unelected people's judgement over what is or isn't equality just changed a whole country without one single vote.

Just like the silly ""Death penalty is unconstitutional"" idea : who ever voted to say that ? Nobobdy. Simply, 3-4-5 judges (depending on the time) think that, according to their own little vision of the world, ""meh that's pretty cruel and unusual, so why not change the whole thing"". If you want this to be a way to govern a country which by the way brags as much as it can about being at the pinacle of democracy, then so be it. But this decision, while it is a victory for gay rights (which I approve), is neither democratic nor very correct. Just 5 people agreeing a new social norm.

Posters were not a wise choice, as you were advised last time around.  Tips:   Your school probably is not going to punish you for asserting that the wage gap is more complicated than people think it is. At worst, you will be socially unpopular. Posters are not a medium conducive to debate. They are a soundbite medium, and in this case they can be freely and anonymously censored. Both of these traits mean that if you take a controversial or unpopular position (as you have), you will lose. Changing minds is mostly about planting the seeds of doubt and being congenial. It isn't glamorous and nearly nobody is going to congratulate you for it. If this doesn't dissuade, you, then start taking advice from people who have been where you are now.

Taking something that should be as straightforward as science, where there is a provably correct answer, and then talk about climate change or evolution and half the US is claiming liberal/secular/communist propaganda is being put into the public classroom.  And it gets even worse when talking about the liberal arts. So who decides that a piece of education is free of ideology and why should we trust that they are unbiased?  A better system is where we have professors of known bias and they present opposing viewpoints. Unfortunately, completely impossible in an environment of Title IX and micro-aggressions.  Perhaps we could have a 'prove it' attitude where professors have to defend their lesson plans. That should theoretically destroy women's studies, except it would probably be other women's studies professors doing the judging.

Edit: actually, I would not say postmodernism distorts the meaning of words.  Rather it completely changes them to mean what they need to mean. Language itself, according to the postmodernist, is a tool of oppression, and therefore traditional meanings are used to oppress by those in power. Objective meaning itself --and by extension objective reality -- is oppressive, and thus should be rejected. This is more dangerous than mere nonsense; it's intellectual nihilism. So yes, meaning has been distorted long before postmodernism, but never before has a philosophy been based on rejecting all meaning, then contradicting that very act by assigning meaning, all by using the justification that logic itself is flawed, so yeah, anything goes."

But of course, freedom of speech and all that is still important. People on Reddit are quick to laugh at racsim, but they can't claim to be anti racism with the way some people behave in /r/blackpeopletwitter or /r/unexpectedjihad. But again it really comes to personal preference of humor.  But I especially don't think it's an appropriate joke to make a day or two after someone has been killed.

The whole ""he dindu nuffin"" is a meme from /pol/ blasting the way the media has reacted to many of the racially charged incidents over the past few years and how it likes to white wash things to create a narrative. Redditors don't really get this and just spout it out because 'lol I'm so funny' circlejerk that reddit's voting system reinforces."

However I wont cede the point that making a joke, even an off color or poor spirited one, is suddenly more wrong because something happened. Would calling someone a faggot be more wrong the day after a gay person got murdered than it would be the day before?   Serious question. If you know it's racist, why are you finding it funny, especially now? Or are you a racist yourself?   Are you kidding me? First off I am admitting the joke is racist using the broad definition of the term, not that its use necessarily reflects a direct and actual hatred of black people. Do you laugh at fucking anything? Americas Funniest Home Videos for example is almost entire people being injured or embarrassed and made laughing stock nationally. That is fucked up. Are you some kind of misanthrope?"
TiADiscussion,3b3vqp,vvarden,6,Fri Jun 26 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"In fairness, I've been seeing this as a response to the recent shootings. Perhaps not on TiA, but elsewhere. Seeing that same language defended here (especially now) makes me a little uncomfortable.  So soon after a high-profile hate crime? Yes, I'd say calling someone a faggot would be worse. The already-loaded term now carries with it even more recent scars. It's why hate crime laws exist.  Following Charleston, 9/11, etc., many comedians took a break. Humor's really important - yes - but sometimes can be inappropriate. Commenters who don't have the same tact can say what they want, but just because it's for ""humor"" doesn't mean it's immune to criticism.  ""Racist by the broad definition of the term""?

It's distasteful and unfunny, in my opinion.   Comedy is great, but it shouldn't be necessary to berate people  who say emotionally charged things to get a laugh.

I think the reason that people worry about feminsts and SJWs right now is that their beliefs aren't that well known. Mainstream media uses feminism as a positive term, and people still say things like ""Feminism is the radical proposition that women are people too."" It's still seen as the movement from decades past that vastly (and I think positively) reformed our civilization toward gender equality. Those of us who are more well-read in the subject tend to see objectionable post-modern thinking and obnoxious ideas like patriarchy, rape culture, and whiteness as a system of oppression.   If it gets any worse, the mainstream view of feminism is going to catch up to the actual radicals. People like Anita Sarkeesian have gotten to do the rounds on mainstream liberal media as though they were actual honest crusaders for truth and equality. Already, though, look at what's happened to Feminist Frequency during E3 this year: their weird school of radical thought is pretty much openly derided by games media, developers, and so on. Despite all of the trolls and poor reporting on GamerGate, it was an angry backlash to radical SJWs and 10 months later media is starting to see GG's SJW opponents for what they are."

Try developing video games that are only for the hyper-sensitive, and not the video game market (i.e., Sunset). See how that works out for you.   In the real world, the consumer is king and courtesy is mandatory. You're allowed to hold unpopular opinions, but you will be expected to behave.

The first point is relevant because a lot, and I mean a lot of feminists and SJWs have a view of legitimacy that derives from their narrative being published by people at Harvard. I've seen it argued that MRAs are not a movement because they don't have a body of peer reviewed work. The problem with this is that there's really nothing fancy about a body of peer reviewed work if the entire field is malarky. Patriarchy/critical theory/ect may all have scholarly articles that determine what contributes to the theory, but just having a sociology journal doesn't make it true. You don't need to convince me that people peer review and publish this stuff, you need to convince me that the whole field doesn't stand on the shakiest of shaky legs. But the only thing that can be challenged is what is allowed to be published within the field, not whether the field itself is a crock of shit or not.   In other words, to quote Noam Chomsky (possibly out of context, i have no clue) ""What you’re referring to is what’s called “theory.” And when I said I’m not interested in theory, what I meant is, I’m not interested in posturing–using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever. So there’s no theory in any of this stuff, not in the sense of theory that anyone is familiar with in the sciences or any other serious field. Try to find in all of the work you mentioned some principles from which you can deduce conclusions, empirically testable propositions where it all goes beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a twelve-year-old. See if you can find that when the fancy words are decoded. I can’t. So I’m not interested in that kind of posturing.Žižek is an extreme example of it. I don’t see anything to what he’s saying. Jacques Lacan I actually knew. I kind of liked him. We had meetings every once in awhile. But quite frankly I thought he was a total charlatan. He was just posturing for the television cameras in the way many Paris intellectuals do. Why this is influential, I haven’t the slightest idea. I don’t see anything there that should be influential.""

It's no doubt been posted in KiA before, you could try searching for it.  My Social Psychology class taught us that there was in fact a mechanism for it to do all of these nasty things, but there was so many flawed aspects of their reasoning that I nearly went mad when it came to that lecture. Essentially they used studies that relied on priming and self report surveys about hypotheticals and the such that ""proved"" that they created associations about violence and sexism and the like by playing games. However they didn't control for whether the participants were gamers nor the expectancy effect, and at the end of the day this is all beside the point that violence and sexism have been plummeting since video games became a thing (definitely not a causal effect either imo, but I think that it's valid to say that it disproves the opposite).  So at the end of the day it's ""inconclusive"", however I wouldn't worry about it being a thing really.  EDIT: Also I believe that a portion of the whole ""reinforces gender roles/ patriarchy blaaahhh"" is mostly rhetoric borrowed from philosopher's that are studied in Communications classes.

TiADiscussion,3av8p9,fuckingliterally,2,Tue Jun 23 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"Subject-expectancy effect:       The subject-expectancy effect, is a form of reactivity that occurs in scientific experiments or medical treatments when a research subject or patient expects a given result and therefore unconsciously affects the outcome, or reports the expected result. Because this effect can significantly bias the results of experiments (especially on human subjects), double-blind methodology is used to eliminate the effect.  Like the observer-expectancy effect, it is often a cause of ""odd"" results in many experiments. The subject-expectancy effect is most commonly found in medicine, where it can result in the subject experiencing the placebo effect or nocebo effect, depending on how the influence pans out.  An example of a scenario involving these various effects is as follows: A woman goes to her doctor with an issue. The doctor diagnoses with certainty, and then clearly explains the diagnosis and the expected route towards recovery. If he does this convincingly, calming her, removing fear and instilling hope, she will likely, through the positive expectancy, experience the placebo effect, aiding in her recovery. On the other hand, if her doctor had had little time for her, was uncertain about the diagnosis, and had given her a prescription, combined with a message along the lines of, ""this may help sometimes,"" and added a message about possible horrible side effects (combined, say, with the patient having talked to a neighbor who also speaks along the same lines about the horrible side effects), then the chance of negative subject-expectancy, or nocebo, becomes quite large.

It's not a direct brain-washing, but subtle hints like Princess Peach (feminine as fuck) being saved by Mario (manly plumber to the rescue!)  According to neurologists, it's what we see is what we learn through repetition. So if an idea is being presented in media so often, we start to believe that is how X Y Z act. And SJW theory states that because of patriarchal media, we all are subconsciously sexist and should repent for our sins.  Source: Former Gender Studies Student/SJW jaded."
TiADiscussion,3av8p9,Violets11,3,Wed Jun 24 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"I just don't see how the Mario games would actually end causing people to believe that men are the saviors and women are the defenseless objects that would need saving. Aside from that, my question to you is do you believe games like Mario, Double Dragon, and games that portray women in a sexual manner actually contribute to a sexist mindset? I've played games that have fallen under these categories all my life and I don't believe any of those portrayals hold any real world truth."
TiADiscussion,3av8p9,Violets11,4,Wed Jun 24 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"Like I said it's not an obvious assertion, but some people are influenced by how medium is shown and what it could represent to people. So for some it can represent stereotypical notions of man saving woman, therefore X more able then Y sort of thing. It's down to a lot of things like cultural upbringing and what you've been exposed to.  So in regards to your question, I personally believe that it is dependent on personal biases and how you see women as a whole. I'll use League of Legends as my best example;  Average people see a LoL character and go; Yeah X is attractive, then move past it. They still do not believe that woman are just sex objects, women are people too and wouldn't treat anyone badly.  Minority of people see a LoL character and go; OMG SO HOT then kinda snowball into LEL MAKE ME A SANDWICH as seen a lot on a lot of xBox Live chats and what have you. These are usually young, influenced by peers, puberty, maybe bad female influences in life/insecurities etc. Then sometimes those kids grow up to be of The Red Pill, some fall back into the average category.  So to sum up what I'm saying, personally I believe that video games, like ALL medium (music, television, cinema) have the ability to create sexist mindsets. But this only tends to happen when an individual falls into a minority category where they are more susceptible to becoming sexist. No one is born with an Original Sin of sexism, it's developed over time because of real world factors.  Also, when it comes to advertising, it's simply sex appeal taps into human sexuality/desire. There's nothing wrong with that, like sexy games/princess-hero tropes unless you actually believe these to reflect real world truths. Then there's an issue based upon your background or individual insecurities.  Feel free to C&C this :)"

TiADiscussion,3av8p9,TheEsqimo,2,Wed Jun 24 07:41:51 2015 UTC,"My old professor for video games and the individual actually has done studies.  It's really hard to say something as concrete as ""video games cause sexism"", but we can notice trends. Dill, Brown, and Collins (2008) found that exposure to sexualized avatars promotes behavior in individuals which is more forgiving of sexual harassment. Fox (my professor :D), and Tricase (2013) found that females who are forced to play as sexualized avatars participate in more self objectification (primarily focusing on self-efficacy through personal physical attributes).  The problem with these studies (as with most all Communications studies) is the groups are not as diverse as gamers usually are. It's almost always college-aged psychology / communications students, many of whom do not self-identify as gamers.  tl;dr: trends have shown that they certainly can, but it's always going to be open to interpretation and circumstance."

TiADiscussion,3awgn7,thechampionofnothing,7,Wed Jun 24 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard to argue that there's zero gender-based discrimination in the workplace. And since men are more motivated towards earnings and more stereotypically conceived as suited for higher paying jobs it's more likely women will be discriminated against in these fields (there are probably other fields where men are discriminated against, but they're also probably much lower paying - like child care)  Most people, maybe all people, carry biases and prejudice against others based on a superficial evaluation of traits and association. Unfortunately, that is human nature. The first step to addressing this is acknowledging how pervasive it is. The last thing anyone should do is think that their group is exempt (and that is, ie, only a white male problem.. ironically using prejudice to deny prejudice)  The big issue is that people today are looking at the pay gap in America - where women with full time employment earn on median 78% what men do - and without further investigation blame all of it on discrimination. Even though it's easy to see there are many other variables. Was John offered 28% more money than Jennifer was? We'll have to wait and see since the article only says he was offered $4000 more, but somehow I doubt she was only offered ~$10000.  This may sound like nitpicking, where afterall no level of discrimination should be acceptable. But it's important to understand all dimensions of the problem. Otherwise people are going to be blamed for something they aren't doing, and no attempt to fix it will actually succeed, short of overcompensating by discriminating against men."

On its face this would seem to make the other, newer study trump this one (although it doesn't say anything about salary it's hard to believe that they'd be more interested in hiring women while paying them less). While 3 years isn't a lot of time there's been a huge recent push in public consciousness of women in STEM.  This is one thing that really irritates me with a lot of feminists today. There's close to zero acknowledgement of or even interest in what they should consider to be progress. A lot of popular statistics and quotes are continually peddled around from sources that are as much as 30-40 years old, being passed as eternal and immutable truths."
TiADiscussion,3awgn7,EmptyEmptyInsides,4,Wed Jun 24 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"Men are more likely to negotiate their pay. Average man in the US works 41 hours a week, average woman 36. Men are more likely to go into the STEM fields, women are more likely to go into the social fields. In countries where pay differences between the fields are minimized (such as Sweden) women are much more likely to choose a social field over a technical field. Over 90% of workplace fatalities happen to males. (But the actual number of workplace fatalities [~4000/year] at the going price of a human life [~2 million] means that this barely contributes to the earning gap.) Women have lower job attachment. They're more likely to retire early and that's not even including children or maternity leave."
TiADiscussion,3awgn7,PaperStew,3,Wed Jun 24 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"My thought about it is that they're going about the wage gap thing the wrong way. They're focusing on the overall gap between the average man and average woman. That is misleading as hell because when you look at it with a smaller scope, you'll see that men and women make the same amount if they have the same jobs and if they work the same hours and are in the same location. Otherwise, there's a hell of a court case there.   What they SHOULD be focusing on is the value that society places upon jobs that are dominated by women vs jobs dominated by men. THAT is a discussion worth having and worth analyzing. It doesn't mean that either side is right or anything like that, it just means that I think there's a legitimate argument if you look at it from that angle.   And also, the encouragement of women working in those kind of jobs that men have that pay better. Though they're doing that right now anyway."

You don't include everyday after when the sub is back to the way every other sub operates as a part of the experiment.   So far as informal hypothesis testing goes, it fucking literally doesn't get any better.   That makes as much sense as ""I shit my pants the other day and ended up winning on a scratch ticket, that must mean I'll always win the lottery if I shit my pants first"". It's anecdotal evidence and nothing more.  We're also ignoring the very possible scenario that people intentionally were fucking with the sub to see how the mods would react.

You literally told someone that had struggled with suicide and depression to try harder next time. You've shown a complete lack of empathy in those posts and essentially said that depressed people are sociopaths.  I am pretty sure that is the behavior of someone who is a sociopath themselves. Please get counseling before you actually talk someone into killing themselves. You obviously have your own issues to deal with.
TiADiscussion,3atw2j,Wylanderuk,-1,Tue Jun 23 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"You forget to mention that the person I told to ""try harder"" was a pathetic attention whore who was very busy insulting me at the time.  What was I supposed to do, embrace the asshole while he was busy spitting in my face?  I have plenty of empathy; I simply reserve it for my friends and the people I like rather than the people who are attacking me.  Let me make it real simple for you.  People who are kind to me = good people = positive value = NEED HELP  People who attack me = bad people = negative value = NEED HARM  If this moral clarity makes me a sociopath, then so be it.  But I have a ton of friends who are intensely devoted to me, and justifiably so - because loyalty is what I care about most, and so in any sort of crisis situation, they know with 100% surety that I'll be on their side.  When a friend of mine once broke up with her mobster boyfriend and he said he would kill her grandmother, why do you think I was the first person she called for help?  Because she knew that any of her friends who were pussies like you would probably start navel-gazing about ""empathy,"" while guys like me never waste any of our sympathy or compassion on bad guys - we simply decide what team we're on and then we act.  In the comment that you're referencing, if the douchebag whom I told off had apologized for his rude comments, I would have been more empathetic and I would have apologized in kind.  Instead, he chose to double down on his obnoxious behavior, so I did likewise.  Empathy is a two way street, and people who don't offer me any empathy have absolutely no right to ask me to empathize with them.  Your call for me to show empathy when the other side was actively spitting venom at me really makes me think of you as a self-righteous prick."

If you disagree with a particular opinion of someone in a thread that's cool, upvote the ones you agree with and allow a space for the like- minded folk to best represent their own ideas, free of feeling the need to be constantly kissing the ass of the majority opinion or becoming antagonistic over getting brigaded.

One of the main issues (and the reason I barely comment anymore) is that when people make the same mistakes, you end up repeating the same corrections. You could make a three or four page pdf with the responses to every SJW claim and just reply by numbers.  As TiA gets new waves of readers, they formulate the same responses and the cycle continues.  As to toxicity, I don't see it. Groupthink isn't the problem it is on other subs due to the fact that we have good mods who won't delete comments that don't break rules. The language used can be harsh, but there are usually people reminding others to chill when they start to take it too seriously."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,lollerkeet,10,Tue Jun 23 06:08:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's a little less tolerance for those who consider themselves feminists who still read and post there because of their disdain for the modern approaches to feminism.   And there's times when things are posted that I actually kind of agree with but are overblown to be the worst thing ever.   Though overall, it's not that bad of a place. There's the asshats but there's always asshats."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,pineyfusion,2,Wed Jun 24 14:54:21 2015 UTC,I think I generally agree with your statements.
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,11,Wed Jun 24 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"I think TiA had has a bad habit of downvoting things simply because it isn't the viewpoints held by the majority, but I wouldn't go so far too call that toxic.  As for the transphobia, I do tend to notice more but I think it's more that the transphobes are starting to discover TiA rather than that TiA is breeding them."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,sryii,4,Tue Jun 23 06:35:00 2015 UTC,"One thing to think about, since TiA does bring in a lot of new people many of them are getting exposed to things they've never thought about before.  I came here knowing next to nothing about what transgender meant.  If anything I've learned more about do many facets of life on here that I would otherwise never have had exposure to."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,2,Thu Jun 25 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"That's true, but at the same time the people I'm thinking about definitely have seemed to have thought a lot about their stance of trans people (in terms of quantity, not quality that is)"
TiADiscussion,3as88p,psychotwilight,4,Thu Jun 25 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I give props to the stellar TiA mods for removing all of the hateful shit really well. They do sometimes make weird decisions, but they do a great job of moderating. The only really noticeable toxic thing is that a lot of the comments are getting stale. There are really only 3 types of comments- discussions, funny threads, and circlejerking. That last one makes up the vast majority of the TiA comment section, mainly because people make the same damn jokes over and over and over again. For example, ""Check your ______ privilege, shitlord!"" and any variation of the phrase ""strong independent womyn"". Both of these prominent examples are relatively bigoted and just plain uncreative. And most of all- they're just annoying."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,psychotwilight,3,Wed Jun 24 00:49:14 2015 UTC,"relatively bigoted and just plain uncreative.   I would agree on the latter count, but don't understand how either remark is bigoted. Would you explain?"
TiADiscussion,3as88p,mightyenano,0,Wed Jun 24 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"well, I an huge on tolerance, and it just seems to thinly mask an intolerance of people who honestly identify as what these remarks parody. I don't get otherkin or a whole bunch of other gender things, but I'm not going to be the one who denies someone that belief."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,silverjazz,12,Thu Jun 25 01:53:59 2015 UTC,I honestly can't look at it on Sundays anymore. Everyone just gets so smug about being right that they seem just like the other people who are so smug over being right.
TiADiscussion,3as88p,slabsquathrust,13,Tue Jun 23 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"Especially now that we're getting things like Fox News or someone saying ""The only privilege is money"" tagged as sanity. The bar for sanity is pretty low these days."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,InOranAsElsewhere,7,Tue Jun 23 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I will say it again, I hate Sanity Sundays.  I come here to laugh at people saying extreme things and trying to justify their sayings as morally superior.  I can get plenty of sanity in the real world."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,slabsquathrust,10,Tue Jun 23 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, as Sanity Sundays were a recent event. After enough people posted ""TW: Sanity"" for the quick karma grab and diluted the sub, those post were referred to /r/TumblrAtRest.   However, the modteam recognized that sanity posts helped break up the rage, so Sanity Sunday was added for that occasional dose of non-rage inducing material."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,InOranAsElsewhere,8,Tue Jun 23 06:41:04 2015 UTC,It probably isn't a bad idea.  Days upon days of the same garbage from tumblr could force us to slowly shift to an echo chamber like them.  Seeing the lighter sides helps avoid the confirmation bias.
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,4,Tue Jun 23 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"That was the thinking behind it. At the time, the sub was getting more and more angry, when the initial goal was light-hearted mocking and pointing and laughing. Beyond that, when TiA was smaller, dissenting opinions and discussions were more likely, and it was thought that Sanity Sunday might help to encourage that."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,airs_eight_white,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:49:30 2015 UTC,Idk why this is downvoted. It's an entirely valid opinion to have.
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,2,Tue Jun 23 06:30:53 2015 UTC,"Because other people like sanity sundays.  Because other people don't just come here for the empty purpose of laughing at things.  Because the ""real world"" is not the bastion of endless sanity that the previous guy wants to believe that it is."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,airs_eight_white,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"Cool, except the downvote system is meant to censor shitposters, not people you personally disagree with. I like that TiA can be a place for discussion, don't contribute to it degenerating into a circlejerk please."

It has literally never worked that way anywhere on reddit, ever  Any illusions on your part that it ever did was because people you happen to disagree with were the ones being downvoted  Wishing for it to be otherwise is wishing for the sun to rise in the West, and the moon to come out at noon"
TiADiscussion,3as88p,airs_eight_white,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:13:57 2015 UTC,"It has literally never worked that way anywhere on reddit, ever   Yes, it's not a part of reddit's rediquette page, nor heavily implied in it's mission statement or anything.   Any illusions on your part that it ever did was because people you happen to disagree with were the ones being downvoted   Your point being? Freedom of Speech only for the things you agree with isn't freedom of speech. Of course you are not forcibly removing the person's right to free speech, but it heavily promotes self censorship. I've seen plenty of posts that got downvoted simply because they were contrarian, and soon after the author had deleted them because of it. KiA and to an extent TiA are both places were people talk about how both censorship and coerced self- censorship are toxic byproducts of SJW's and the people they surround themselves with, why is it that you are so complacent with it occurring within the community? Yes, I've seen comments in the negatives that I've agreed with, but I've also seen comments in the negative that I upvoted not because I agreed with them, but because this whole notion of downvoting something simply because you disagree, on a website that is in the middle of trying to maintain an identity of being a community where one can speak freely is just dumb."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,6,Tue Jun 23 10:53:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's not a part of reddit's rediquette page, nor heavily implied in it's mission statement or anything.   Nothing about either of those things changes that it has literally never worked that way anywhere on reddit, ever.  Sorry to be the one to break it to you that redditiquette is a fairy tale, but redditiquette is a fairy tale."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,airs_eight_white,-1,Tue Jun 23 11:13:27 2015 UTC,"So you're going to just use the ""well other people do it so why can't I"" argument to ignore the entire body of my post that states that promoting free expression is a fundamental aspect of this website? I know you're trying to make some adult, pragmatic, ""well in the real world"" argument, but you have done nothing to refute any philosophical aspect of what I'm trying to say. This is the internet. No policy is going to be perfectly implemented. If you think that a bunch of children ignoring the rules justifies you bringing yourself down to their level, then congratulations, you're contributing to why it is Ellen Pao and the people working with her can ban subreddits in the name of ""creating a safe space"" while seeing themselves as being on the moral high ground. You're contributing to the ""one too many kids were being assholes on the swings so now nobody can use them"" mentality that is growing on this and other websites. You might think that I'm being hyperbolic, but the philosophical position that you hold here is what their entire worldview is counter to. ""Allowing complete freedom leads to abusing that freedom, so some censorship is needed"" is the authoritarian counterpoint to what it is you are trying to argue, and I don't even think that you realize that."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,wolfdreams01,3,Tue Jun 23 11:55:15 2015 UTC,"Christ that's a lot of words.

TiADiscussion,3as88p,slabsquathrust,3,Tue Jun 23 13:27:05 2015 UTC,"I think you're putting way too much value on those Internet Points.  Do we get free airfare or discounts at 10,000 Karma?"
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:08:35 2015 UTC,Hahah don't feel bad.  I'll survive without the internet karma.  I just don't browse too much on Sundays.  I don't really care if it stays or goes.  If enough folks like it I certainly won't suffer spending a day with less time on reddit.
TiADiscussion,3as88p,fuckingliterally,3,Tue Jun 23 06:37:01 2015 UTC,If looking at screenshots of tumblr have taught you anything it's that you should be interpreting this as an attack on you personally and that this patriarchal acceptance of Sanity Sunday should be abolished!

TiADiscussion,3as88p,MosDaf,3,Tue Jun 23 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree, but then I'm sure I'm (falsely ) thought to be ""transphobic."". Though I'd argue that that's one way on which TiA has become  sjw -ized.  I think that everybody ought to be able to live their lives as they see fit, and that absolutely includes people who are transgendered. But I don't think that e.g. Caitlin Jenner is a woman. In fact, I think it couldn't be cleared that s/he isn't, and the arguments for the contrary view are patently fallacious. I in no way hate nor disrespect people who are transgendered. I merely disagree with the majority here about a biological/philosophical issue. I generally keep it to myself because I realize that TiA does not/want to discuss that issue. When I do point out the confusions that underwrite the new orthodoxy, people here get pretty pissed, and the downvotes roll in. My own view is that TiA is so eager to prove that it's liberal that it stumbles all over itself to be as PC as possible on this issue. My $0.02"
TiADiscussion,3as88p,lifeonthegrid,2,Tue Jun 23 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your opinion on it, and we'll probably never share an opinion on the matter. I see comments popping up more frequently saying things that are actually hateful towards transgender people in tia prime. They generally get downvoted and deleted and I've slowed browsing down because of them.  While she (or myself) are not biologically female, we are still women. White matter microstructures in the brain are different for men and women, where as a transsexual is somewhere between before HRT. Also the David Reimer case to me shows that there is an innate gender identity. Nurture might have some part in it, but there is definitely a biological element.  There is a new study coming out soon that hopefully will add to the slowly growing body of evidence supporting transsexuals."
TiADiscussion,3as88p,lifeonthegrid,8,Tue Jun 23 03:33:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I know this issue is not to be discussed around here, and I certainly don't want to point to things that might make you or others feel bad...but 'woman' means adult female human. Jenner is not female ergo Jenner is not a woman. It's extremely politically incorrect to say so, but that's the simple fact of the matter.   I'm totally behind Jenner and others living their lives as they like...but as a simple matter of biology and English, Jenner isn't a woman. I doubt that the hypothesis about structural brain differences holds up. Even science is susceptible to political pressure...  But even if it does, brain structure is not definitive of maleness and femaleness. The really chilling thing is to see purely scientific/conceptual questions being assimilated to political ones. Not by you, incidentally...but by thehive mind that has decided that we must all not only be accepting of transgenderism--which is true--but that we must all also accept biological/conceptual theories about maleness and femaleness. That is, the hive mind has decided that one can be a bigot for believing the wrong theory....even though there are actually better reasons for that theory than for the politically correct one. That's straight-up Lysenkoism..."

Rule 3: DON'T BE A SCHMUCK.   3A: Don't make fun of people with genuine problems like cancer, autism, or depression, or some medical issue that you might not believe is real, but feel free to make fun of anyone who's self-diagnosed with something and is clearly bullshitting. You know where the line is.  3B: Also, treat your fellow shitlords excellently. Don't tear them down just because they're a proud feminist (or MRA, or libertarian, or communist or whatever). Respectfully disagree, if you do. Personal attacks are dick moves, so don't make them (and that goes for how you respond to the mods as well). Name calling or starting a flamewar/general dickheadness will not be tolerated. Be civil, we are here to laugh.  3C: Also, Try not to post blogs where the blogger is under 16. It is not always going to be apparent, but when it is, don't post it. The rationale here is that 13 year old otherkin is a lot different than a 30 year old one. One is a kid that is likely just going through a phase and the other one is a grown ass adult that has made a choice to be otherkin. That is just an example though and other areas we deal with have the same sort of rationale. There is no need for a ton of people goofing on a dopey kid when there are a ton of dopey adults out there.

TiADiscussion,3as88p,Tohsakas_Anus,5,Tue Jun 23 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"Friendly reminder that if you're going to directly characterize someone (or their views) as -phobic, or an -ist, or as a bigot..., you need to explain what in your opinion makes them so.  Why? Because accusations of bigotry, even when wholly justified, are not something to be causally bandied about. Doing otherwise is ultimately nothing more than an intellectually dishonest and lazy way to dismiss a position out of hand--at best. At worst, it is a bullying tactic. Both approaches are commonly used by SJWs.  This is TiA. We're supposed to be better than that, here."

TiADiscussion,3as88p,orderingrabbits,2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"I should have thought this would have been obvious, but discussion on Reddit does not take place behind closed doors. We all speak in a public sphere here, even if we only directly speak to one person. Public discourse carries obligations that private discourse does not.  Do you really not see the issue? Characterizing someone in this fashion without stating why is simply lazy. If someone is a bigot or phobic or what have you, there is a reason this is so, and those reasons can and should always be named. Not doing so--in public, at least--is dishonest. It removes the other person's ability to defend themselves by responding to the accusation. There, is after all, is nothing to actually respond to--and yet, such accusations, even baseless accusations, tend to be incredibly powerful. Nobody wants to agree with a bigot, after all. Even on things that have nothing to do with that issue.  Remember too that bigotry is a remarkably pernicious human trait. But it never stands up--has never, not even once--to meaningful scrutiny. Light should be shone on it whenever it is found."

TiADiscussion,3as9ou,cold_white_silence,6,Tue Jun 23 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty pervasive.  Watching movies and tv shows is where it's pretty damn obvious, though, at least on a superficial level. Pretty much every single piece of media will feature at least one heterosexual relationship. Yet many times, when there's one gay character, people will complain about ""gay stuff being thrown in their face"". Game of Thrones fans' reaction to Loras and Renly, and people's reactions to Sense8 sometimes can make this privilege obvious.  That doesn't mean it's inherently a bad thing, however. I'm not condemning the Marvel movies for not having a gay character, because I get the economics of the situation. It's a little frustrating that you can have Star Lord seducing girls across the galaxy, which ""promotes a straight agenda,"" but not have any LGBT characters. Doesn't make the movies bad, but I'd love to have a more inclusive blockbuster some day.  Media's pretty small in the grand scheme of things, though, and most of the other stuff is obvious - marriage, adoption, social settings. But movies are easier to explain the concept :)"
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,vvarden,3,Tue Jun 23 05:45:34 2015 UTC,"Just a question. Do you think this inclusiveness in hollywood should reflect the numbers? Wikipedia says that 3.8% of Americans fit under the label of LGBT. Is 3.8% of characters enough?   As an aside, it is honestly pretty apparent when a characters sexuality is important to the plot of the story, as compared to when it is just there to be there. As a book fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, it was not painfully obvious that the Knight of Flowers was gay, as it made zero impact on the story. However in the television series it was clearly added for shock value, adding absolutely no real substance."
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,cold_white_silence,3,Tue Jun 23 05:57:24 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree that Loras being gay is a minor element, especially in the show. his character plays prominent role as Renly's lover trying to bring him to power, and because they're both gay it's an effective way of illustrating how the Tyrells play the game. But shock value? That's... a little offensive, honestly. Unless all the sex scenes are ""shocking"". Racy? Lurid? Yes, but we've all known ASOIAF is both those things for some time.   I'm not really interested in meeting a quota. If the story's worth telling, tell it. I don't need to be straight to find Iron Man cool, black to understand the pain of 12 Years a Slave, or be a robot to feel WALL-E's loneliness. People don't need to be gay to watch a movie with gay characters, either. We're all human, and we all have human problems."
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,vvarden,0,Tue Jun 23 06:28:00 2015 UTC,"But shock value? That's... a little offensive   Really? Offensive? I just re watched the scene to make sure I wasn't making an ass of myself. And while I find the shows use of sex as the forefront to exposition crude, the scene just wasn't needed. It wasn't well written, it wasn't well delivered, and the only things learned from it were: Loras and Renly are gay, and Loras is ambitious on behalf of Renly. So yes I think the scene was essentially a blowjob delivery vehicle, for the sake of their being such a scene.   I just asked the original question though because you mentioned    ""It's a little frustrating that you can have Star Lord seducing girls across the galaxy, which ""promotes a straight agenda,"" but not have any LGBT characters.""    It just seems like an odd movie about which to even talk about sexuality. I mean... of the main 5 characters 2 of them are pretty much non sexual. One has a dead wife and doesn't seem to think about much but violence and one liners. And the other two are kind of the only characters left open for the two scenes of sexual tension they did put in the movie. And considering the amount of liberties they took with the ruining the Nova Corp, and ruining Ronan the Accuser, as well as severe changes to Drax and Peter Quill.  I am glad they didn't take it any farther than they did by making someone more different for the sake of being so."
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,Wylanderuk,5,Tue Jun 23 06:49:19 2015 UTC,"Regarding Guardians, I'm not saying that a character should be gay. I'm just indicating that straight is the default - PG13 seduction scenes are fine, as long as it's heterosexual (not saying he should be gay, btw).   In GOT, many sex scenes aren't ""needed"" in the show, per se. But Renly and Loras's fleshed out the characters and motivations. Blowjob delivery? It wasn't even graphic (the ""play with her ass"" scene would be more ""shock"" than that one). We can disagree on the quality of the execution; I just wanted to say that for a scene to be ""shocking"" simply because it's gay is a perfect illustration of this ""privilege"" in action."
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,vvarden,3,Tue Jun 23 07:23:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just indicating that straight is the default   Well yes, because it actually is, when something is over 90% likely to true then it is the default by definition.  I mean if the sited figure is correct 3.8% of the population Hell lets go for 6% then any more than that is over representation.  For the record  I don't really care much if there are gays/lesbians in a show I am watching or a book I am reading if it does not detract from the show/book."
TiADiscussion,3as9ou,Wylanderuk,2,Tue Jun 23 07:36:48 2015 UTC,The question OP asked was about privilege. I'm just trying to illustrate that by straight being default it pops up in a lot of ways. I'm not looking for a quota at all.  You say it doesn't detract. Good! For a lot of people it does.

Yes, and straight characters aren't immune from that either.  But I've seen that same argument of yours used in pretty much every instance of a gay character, regardless of quality of writing. From Brokeback Mountain (good) to turning Iceman in X-Men gay (huh?), people say it's ""shoving it in their face."" That's why it's a sensitive topic."

Patriotic ads around 4th of July and Christmas-themed ads pander to American patriots and Christians, but it's accepted.  In many places, you can still be fired from your job for being gay. Wells Fargo took part in LA's Pride parade a couple weeks ago; I'd rather have too-earnest displays of inclusiveness be the norm instead of no one stepping up to say anything.  It's a fine line. Gay Iceman is pandering, but so's pretty much every social issue covered in mainstream comics (Black Panther, female Thor). But it's a sadly necessary midpoint before inclusiveness becomes the norm (Black Panther's pretty well-rounded as a character now, for example)."

I also don't know why they had to have original Thor lose his powers and not just have her discover she's also a god.  Marvel in particular seems to be riding the social justice train pretty hard, for less than noble reasons. If you think they just now started to care about representing women/racial minorities/GSM within the past 5 years, that means the company is either thinly veneering over their bigotry with tokens or Disney doesn't want their bottom line to be affected by Tumblr being up in arms.

Having watched a few episodes, they really never really rise above that. So it was a show about identities told in a sci-fi way.   But this is the genre that deals with space and time travel and these huge ideas about exploration and science, so to a lot of people it just seemed like a small, petty show that thought it was a big show. It is pandering, in my opinion. I think they designed it to be that way and thought it could live on the same level as Stargate.   But this is fucking sci-fi, it's not a genre unfamilair to homosexuality and diversity and social-futurism, gender roles and different the clash of different societies and their values.

When you grow up, you have far more role models to work with and you're not seen as a freak by your peers (which is a major issue in high school).  You're also WAY more likely to find someone who's at least vaguely capable of dating you that you're interested in (imagine being the only gay kid in a school, at least the only out one).

In socially liberal areas with laws forbidding discrimination, legalized marriage, and an accepting populace, not as much, especially if you have a family that is fine with it as well. In the latter case, the only real problem is a scarcity of potential romantic partners and perhaps a high rate of STDs.  You really can't quantify how much privilege each individual LGBT person has.

Referring to yourself is completely gender neutral in all cases I can think of.  Then as you said in direct conversations it is rarely brought up. Especially with art blogs it is a ""I made this for *name*""   Although as others have brought up that in a conversation between more than two people the he/ shes become more necessary. I suppose on the internet messages tend to be more direct. There are less group interactions that would require such words. Or maybe the people I watch use pronouns less simply because like me they don't know the other people's gender."

My advice is to get out of Tumblr entirely or make a new account about non-SJW topics, unfollow all your SJW friends' feed on Facebook, and do not talk about politics with your SJW friends, if you want to talk to them at all. If they can't shut up about them, then you can cut them off from your life without shame - they aren't good friends anyways. In my case, my SJW friends are far better in person and don't talk about politics as much, and are more reasonable when they do (partially because they don't see me as their mortal enemy, the conservative Republican).  As for finding moderate friends, my tip is to look for science/engineering/math majors, but that is still no guarantee as I personally know a good number of STEM major SJWs, just not as many in proportion. Another place to look is outside of school - very few independent adults are SJWs outside of university professors, some lawyers, and actual social justice activists. Join campus organizations in college focused on a specific interest that is not ideologically based - you'll find a good mix.  Best of luck to you, and I hope you can find more reasonable friends.  Also, advice to anyone who thinks they're trapped in an SJW bubble:   You'll know you're too far in when you see the world's people in shades of privilege, when you start to feel ashamed of yourself and your privilege (if you're white, male, straight, etc.), if your SJW ""friends"" belittle you over problematic views or anything else, or if you see everything as problematic."

I have exactly one friend who's an SJW, but all we talk about is Magic: The Gathering. You could say she's my buddy because of one very focused hobby that we share. We don't talk about politics or political leanings, and instead we just hang out, and don't let it come between us. Of course, she's a ""moderate"", even though we don't see these much nowadays. She believes in rape culture, but doesn't quite care about the ableism or HAES shit. So I mean, it doesn't permeate every discussion we have.  However, if the SJW-ness permeates every discussion you have with your friends ever, then you do need to find a new friends circle. I'd suggest going out, and talking to as many new people as you possibly can.  I'm mildly autistic, so I wouldn't be the best at giving advice about how to deal with social situations, but here's how I do it. I make my feelings perfectly clear at all times, maybe this works for you, maybe it doesn't. I would make it perfectly clear that this sort of conversation doesn't jive with me, that if you can jettison it for the duration of the time I'm present, I'd stay and we'd have a good time, but if you can't, I'm sorry, but I can't abide by it and I have to leave.

They considering themself non-dysphoric genderfluid asexual demi-romantic. They're very open with rude to their parents, and our moms are friends, and their behaviour was starting to affect my relationship with my own parents, which wasn't stellar to begin with. When they started wearing ''dead men don't catcall'' shirts and putting ''QUEER'' (a word that, as they were aware, the rest of the friendgroup still takes offense to) patches all over their jackets, in short when their behaviour was making me uncomfortable and affecting my relationship with other people, I cut it off. At that point I think it's hard to make yourself the douchebag. Explain your grievances. Give them a chance to fix it. If they lash out at you, as SJWs tend to do, back out.

TiADiscussion,3aodfl,Penguin--Soldier,3,Mon Jun 22 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"Okay the comments here are, honestly, a bit ridiculous. Y'all being a bit too Tumblr :). There's no need to hate on them or tell this guy he should be happy his friends are gone. He's in a weird and confusing place.  So, firstly... ""usually I try not to let people's political leanings take lead over their character. These SJWs want their political leanings to be their identity"". I can relate. I was in the exact same situation. I made some friends after moving cities, and many of them went varying shades of SJW in the next couple years.   It can be very difficult to separate someone's personal identity from their political identity, but it's important to recognize that the whole ""SJW"" thing (really, SJW is a huge blanket term for so many different walks), in whatever form someone chooses to interpret it, isn't so much a political choice but a lifestyle choice. I'm not going to say social justice is a religion, that's going too far. But many people treat it as one, in the way they integrate it into their day to day lives.  If they have made the decision to affect their personal identity by adopting new viewpoints, they run the risk of alienating their friends. It's a risk you run changing the person you are all the time. The onus is on them to maintain their friends and balance their personal change with their personal relationships.  We live in a world that assumes (at least, up through college) a fairy tale version of friendship that lasts forever. The reality is more subtle. Most people I've met have a few very close friends, maybe even just one. But the rest come and go as you move through your life, and your own personal identities change. They're not the friends you'll keep for all your life, but friends of opportunity and convenience. That's not a bad thing.   You can definitely bridge the gap and get past that, but it depends on both you and them. If they're not willing to bridge that gap as well, you probably won't ever get anywhere."
TiADiscussion,3aodfl,Wylanderuk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"I am a girl, actually, I don't know if that changes how the friendships work...I feel like girl friendships are a lot different than boys', but I'm not a dude so I can't say.   The thing is, I get easily annoyed with them already, but the SJW shit is the icing on the cake. I think I'm a pretty shit friend, seeing as I really don't care if people shit talk them or not on here. But I see what you mean! If these people were actually genuine best pals of mine, I'd be a lot more eager to defend them. While I would say they're my closest circle of friends, they aren't the true best friends who I trust with secrets and emotional turmoil.   I think that, to use your words, ""friends of opportunity and convenience"" describes them perfectly. I think that is my major flaw here: pretending friends of opportunity are the ones I need to keep around forever. I think I'm now realizing that I don't want friends who let their social politics run their lives. It has caused so much negativity in my life and every time I am with them, I'm walking on eggshells and waiting for them to make a snide SJW-esque commentary.   Thank you for these words: they truly helped me figure out some stuff!"
TiADiscussion,3aodfl,Wylanderuk,2,Tue Jun 23 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"I have some friends that aren't really SJW but do from time to time discuss or repost things that involve that mindset. I find it difficult to deal with since I've had a negative experience with a friend turning SJW and the fact a lot of that stuff makes me angry in general, so I generally have a zero-tolerance policy on anyone talking about it with any kind of regularity. The issue here is however, that I can't just drop people I've talked to for 1+ year or even longer just because they talked about my favorite upcoming game being 'problematic because boobs"".   I just mute them temporarily instead."
TiADiscussion,3aodfl,Toby-one,2,Mon Jun 22 11:59:08 2015 UTC,Frankly if your going to cut them out of your life completely why do you care what they think?

TiADiscussion,3aodfl,psychotwilight,5,Mon Jun 22 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"I think my main issue is that my social circles overlap a lot.

Whenever they try to push me into retarded discussions on facebook I just ignore them (It's great that you can turn off notifications for specific conversations now) and if they try to start one in real life I just smile and wave and go to the fridge to get a beer. So far they've been smart enough to get it and have stopped bringing their shit up when I am around.  The only thing I'm worrying about now is that my best friend who is normally a very cold and analytical person has fallen under the influence of a SJW woman. He's started talking about non-problems like if they are actual problems and he's started using the word ""problematic"" for non-problematic things that annoys this woman he's met. So now I'm worried that I'm going to have to cut his legs off and throw him into a volcano."

Maybe I'm paranoid, but it's happened to enough people I know both online and IRL that I can't afford to take chances.  The funny part is that I agree with them about 70% of the time and among my remaining friends I'm the resident SJW. I've actually become considerably less SJWy over the past couple of years thanks to being with my girlfriend.

TiADiscussion,3aodfl,LukeMara,5,Tue Jun 23 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Ah yes!   Alright so they aren't really extreme but here's a few things I've heard from my SJW friends.  1) I expressed my hatred for a female character because she was boring as shit and was only introduced for a really stupid plotline. I was told this was misogynistic because I didn't have a good enough reason for hating her. ""You have to at least appreciate her as a female character!"" is almost exactly what I was told as well. That day, I learned that you have to like female characters even if you hate them.   2) I asked if it was racist to say that Swedes and Kenyans have beautiful skin. I was told yes. I said something about how I'm just trying to make an effort to be more aware of racist language since, y'know, I genuinely didn't know if it was racist to say something like that. Then, I got told ""wow, you sound like every typical white person trying to be a good person"".   3) ""I have vowed never to have a boy as a friend again. I've learned from my mistakes."" ""My life has been so much better since I've only befriended girls and decided to stop being friends with boys."" ""Boys are boring, I'm so past them."" (That one was said in the presence of a boy).   4) During the Charlie Hebdo hype, I saw a lot of stuff on my Facebook. Basically, everyone decided that if you even mentioned Islam in the conversation about the shootings, you were being islamophobic. My friend posting something along the lines of ""instead of being islamophobic and gross, you could just focus on grieving for the 12 lost lives and their families"". This was about a minute after I tweeted something about how the shooters did it in the name of radical Islam and stating that isn't Islamophobic. I have little doubt her status update was geared towards me.   5) I posted a really long rant about American Sniper shortly before deleting my Tumblr (this was after seeing my friends post incredibly misguided posts about the film). In the post, I basically said that people should see the movie and understand the context of some of the quotes they're complaining about. It's not supposed to be a pretty movie, it's a WAR FILM. My friend posted right after something along the lines of ""I hate when my friends have wrong opinions, but I can't explain why I disagree because I don't have the ability to argue.""  6) Anytime I bring up my heritage, they all get all sarcastic about it. Even though they're white. At a party, I was bonding with a guy over being a certain percentage of Irish. I said that I was mostly German, but with a good amount of Irish, Hungarian, and English. Friend 1 makes a stupid joke about how were all equally white. Whenever they do that, I just say I'm proud of my heritage. I said ""But I'm like really German, I have family in Germany."" And Friend 2 starts questioning me like ""Oh you do? Really? What family?"" I say my uncle and cousins. ""What cousins? I've never heard of them..."" I name them off. ""Well, how much do you talk to them?"" That night, I learned that not talking to your German cousins every week means they aren't really your cousins.   7) One of my friends said that she jokes a lot about how she's going to start free bleeding to make a point about tampon prices, but if they get more expensive, she would actually do it. She then complained to me a lot about tampon/pad prices, even though I told her they're not that expensive and people have to pay for toilet paper too. She compared it to condoms. I said condoms are used to prevent STDs as well as pregnancies, so there's a reason they're given out for free. Plus one is a contraception, the other is a hygienic tool. Women benefit from condoms too. She stuck by her belief that tampons should be free.   8) We're all 1D fans (sorry guys, I've failed Reddit), but one of my friends went on a rant about how girls shouldn't see Harry Styles as supportive of women just because he ""held up a sign for that shitty HeForShe campaign"" (even though he's supported women in various other instances but w/e). She expects better from her boy band faves. Because unless they're supporting your cause CORRECTLY, they're not doing it at all! Because HeForShe puts the focus on MEN and HOW DARE MEN be considered ALLIES?   9) They all hate capitalism but not ONE could tell you why besides repeating empty arguments from Tumblr. One also said that big businesses would barely have a problem with raising the minimum wage to $15, but her proof was lacking and she didn't seem to have an informed opinion about it.   10) One is still mad that Louis Tomlinson said the N word back in April 2014.   11) They all believe sexism and racism are one way streets. They actually use the same repeated argument of ""racism isn't about hurt feelings, it's about power!!!!!!"".   12) They use the term fuckboy regularly to describe people they don't even know all that well.   13) They hated this one girl until she came out as having an eating disorder. Then all of a sudden, they hero worshipped her and ignored the fact that they were rude and mean to her for years.  They're pretty mild overall, now that I type it out, but it's one of those things where I've been friends with them so long that I know their ill will. They're angrier online than in person."

TiADiscussion,3anfxo,elbenji,5,Mon Jun 22 00:30:30 2015 UTC,I think it boils down to what humans are instrinsically attracted to. Fairer shaded skin on women of any skin colour seems to be seen as more desirable across the globe. In general

TiADiscussion,3anfxo,anthemlog,17,Mon Jun 22 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"Well, the biggest part of the problem is that this whole ""Blackout"" thing was spawned on social media.  Largely by those who are strict believers and enforcers of segregation style ""anti-appropriation"" measures.  The ones who believe white people shouldn't eat Mexican, or Indian food, or wear any sort of clothing from other cultures.  A large of portion of those who started and certainly latched onto the whole ""Blackout"" thing are those who already believed heavily in excluding others.  So by almost course of nature they're going to play the exclusionary ""No!  This is  my thing!"" bullshit because that's what they've been doing all along with everything else.  Like everything else with SJWs, the best response is to say ""fuck 'em"" and just have you do you.  Let the the haters whine and cry all they want and just do what you want.  Blackout itself isn't that bad an idea, but a lot of those who latch onto it are your typical tumblr/social media style assholes."

The captions were all like ""LOOOOL"" and ""You go giiirl!""  I guess its possible the friends were in on it and could take it, but it seems so Goddamn low to me to post a picture of yourself tearing down people you call friends to make yourself feel better.  And the amount of people supporting it was bullshit.  It encourages people to engage in friendships with fucked up boundaries.    I hate sliding slope arguements, but I can't help but wonder how long it will be until we start to see (if, that is) any real racially based violence against whites. I don't forsee it as a huge problem, but I'm sure there's going to be a spike in that area before everything settles down again."

If they have a pertinent point, and aren't trying to actively get your panties in a bunch, and if that's just a consequence of your shitty mentality, then they're not a troll.   since women aren’t supposed to be heard; we’re just supposed to shut up and look pretty.   If you're loud and obnoxious, you're supposed to shut up. If you make a scene, you're supposed to shut the fuck up. This has nothing to do with being a woman, it has everything to do with you being a fucking loudmouth cunt.

You're supposed to be docile. Everyone's supposed to be docile, you fucking idiot. We're all supposed to be kind, and polite, and most of all, not causing a fucking ruckus wherever the fuck we go.

Some people - the sociopathic 10%ers at the top of the social totem pole - have figured out that this whole ""social justice"" system can be easily manipulated to earn them all kinds of social or actual capital. Just play your victim cards right and hate the right people the right way, and you'll find yourself climbing to a position of power and influence you never dreamed of having in the real world.  Others - the 90%ers who completely lack self-awareness - simply enjoy the feeling of victimhood. Makes them feel special and important, like they really matter. When the average tumblrina reads in someone's blog that it's tooootally oppressive to her when a man sits with his legs apart on the subway because he's asserting his dominance and privilege over her, her eyes turn into dollar signs and she says to herself, ""so I AM a victim! I'm so important now!!!""  There's kings and there's pawns. There are those who know exactly how the real world works but manipulate narratives in their favor, and then there are those who simply enjoy the sensation of being in the narrative and are willing to suspend their disbelief to make it feel real."

For example, there's ones out there that have shit like ""I am against affirmative action"" that scores you racist points.  WTF?  Since when is that a racist opinion?  There's scores of reasons to be against affirmative action - namely being race shouldn't be a factor in giving someone a position in a school or company, and the entire concept being racist to begin with.    Yes, I know what the Harvard test is about and I've taken it.  It's not subjective in that sense, but since you can't possibly eliminate other variables (maybe lighter skin tones are easier for the eye to see on computer screen and thus score more favorably, etc), it doesn't really tell you anything.    TL;DR you can't test for racism because it's inherently a subjective distinction.    PS. Your brain naturally favors people of your own race or the race you grew up around.

Since when is that a racist opinion?   I'm not surprised in the least. Why? The underlying theory is that since there is institutional and past racism that stains our society, banning the use of race-based measures merely lets the past racism's negative effects continue into the present without doing anything about it, and you are in effect perpetuating the disadvantage for PoCs that was brought on by past policies such as slavery, segregation, etc.   It is best summed up by a quote from Lyndon Johnson: ""You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.  You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ""you are free to compete with all the others,"" and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.  Thus it is not enough just to open the gates of opportunity. All our citizens must have the ability to walk through those gates.""  THAT, in a few sentences, is the entire underpinning of affirmative action, and why the modern civil rights community says that being against affirmative action is racist.   PS. Your brain naturally favors people of your own race or the race you grew up around. Science is a racist bitch!

I never claimed that you could get rid of unconscious biases, but you could, with practice, prevent yourself from acting on them in such a manner that treats people unfairly. For example, the IAT can be cracked such that you get a ""neutral"" score, making it seem as if you don't have racist attitudes. That is an example of overcoming your own unconscious biases by conscious practice. The young children did not have any incentive to and so let their unconscious biases affect their actions. But if you are really, really serious about not demonstrating (in action) any biases at all (having them is the not the same thing as demonstrating them), you would have to consciously practice at it."

The things that don't have the tax aren't things deemed to be necessary, they're things the government wants to subsidise. Fresh fruit and veg aren't taxed because the government wants to incentivise healthy eating.   Arguing that tampons shouldn't be taxed is the same as arguing that they should be subsidised. Why should they be subsidised? Other products that only one gender uses are not subsidised. Condoms are, but that's because the government wants to encourage their use so that people have fewer STIs and unwanted pregnancies. And they're a bad example anyway because both men and women buy/use condoms, just because it goes on the penis doesn't mean the owner of said penis paid for them or was the only one wanting to use one.

Imagine you think you're fighting for the interests of what you see to be an oppressed collective, and then a member of that collective stands up and acts as though they're in favour of that oppression. Then add that this person probably just jumped in the debate when you said that all members of this oppressed collective stand with you and that the only way someone could be against you and your group is to have some sort of prejudice against this oppressed collective.   Suddenly you're ability to character assassinate all your enemies is gone, your moral superiority as the speaker for the oppressed is suddenly damaged and it's all because of some ungrateful prick who likes being oppressed and can't see that they are because they're ignorant of all the courses and study you've done to understand the subliminal meanings in so many day to day activities.

While there's a (inevitable and kind of impossible to avoid) problem with pushing your beliefs upon one of your own kind in the first place (or doing so to anyone for that matter), the largest problem of course is that feminists aren't actually being oppressed by western society, and most certainly not systematically (though it could be argued that some societal problems remain, and fact of the matter is they do).  Feminism nowadays is a stolen title, and the equivalent of a rotting corpse filled with maggots, simply using the body to defend themselves from criticism by accusing anyone who disagrees of being ""against equality."" Having known and had firsthand experience with (perhaps the extreme side of) ""feminism"" as a kid when my parents split, I have nothing but disdain for the inequality that modern feminism has created.

Quaker beliefs are rooted in the notion that men and women are equal in the eyes of God; they are fundamentally no different.  Push back and say if they aren't Christian they don't deserve the right to or hold jobs. When they flip out, point out that the early first-wave American feminists were Quakers. In other words, push their shit back down their throat.  You can do that with blacks and Republicans too. Pretty funny.

TiADiscussion,3akxji,EmptyEmptyInsides,3,Wed Jun 24 02:31:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's part of the the philosophical basis for most of these movements.  Marxism, feminism, etc, all share a root idea of ""classes"". So it's one class against another, if one class is down another is up, or if one class in up another is down.  Class warfare is the model they use in understanding the political dynamics of the society.  So when you work from the understanding that anyone who does something that helps the other class is putting themselves down to lift up the other class, it's treason.  Not because it is, but because the basis for understanding the act is the constant warfare that your model assumes must be happening makes it look like treason.    The above dynamic is usually false.  Everyone works to their own best interests, sure.  But the assumption that it's thermonuclear war all the time is false.  Most people eventually get that.  They get that the personal isn't always political, and that's ok.  Heck, it's normal for those things to happen.  It's normal for a husband and wife to talk through all the decisions regarding children and decide together how to handle the wife's job.  Not as enemies, but as actual partners.  Cooperation and compromise between people is normal because most of the time, it's not about politics but about what works for those two people on that problem.  I find the usual class warfare models to be useless in figuring out what's going on.  Usually, both sides are doing hard core game theory to get most people what they want."

TiADiscussion,3akxji,Bla34112,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the context in which you've seen this. I'm not sure I can explain it very well, but I hope this makes sense. I'm definitely not saying this is right, but I'm going to try to explain it.   So if you truly believe feminism is about equality, you believe that feminists are people who want equality for the sexes. And if you think about it that way, people who are anti-feminism must be anti-equality. If you're a woman who doesn't want equality, you don't want to be equal to men (obviously). If you don't want to be equal to men, you must be stuck in the past, in a time where women couldn't vote and couldn't do many of the jobs they can now. Thus, if you're anti-feminism, why would you want to be allowed to vote or work? Those things would just make you equal to men.  Does that make sense?"

It doesn't help that the actual feminist answer to people who think abortion is child murder is literally ""I should be allowed to murder as many of my children as I wish"".

Disclaimer before I go any further, I am not going to be making an argument that abortion is wrong or that it is murder, I am simply making a statement about the Left. I think that our generation's lack of ability to take responsibility and tendency to shift blame has resulted in this idea that [hetero]sex is something that happens to women as opposed to something that they participate in. As such, pregnancy is something that happens to women as well, not something that they had a hand in. As such, the abortion debate (coming from the Left) that they should be allowed to ""murder"" their children comes from the idea that women should have the ultimate say in whether or not the ultimately carry a child to term.

In America, at least in some Southern states, there is no access to abortions for 500 miles, and for very poor women or women without cars who need abortions it can basically still be a fight for access, especially where they've passed waiting periods for abortions.

That's not to mention that there are sure to be costs associated with keeping it in the artificial womb, and a lot of people get abortions for financial reasons, and the state or insurance would thus either prefer abortion or make it a pain to sever links between the parent and spawn. (To assume capitalism isn't ruthlessly profit driven is idiocy)  And when the baby is done, what happens?

Manspreading, it seems, only has any controversy due to its title. Anyone can do it, and it's merely a form of sitting.

I think that's a good thing, but I suppose not everyone would agree.  Apart from that though, modern feminism has if anything seriously fucked up western society... it's replaced some former wrongs with equally terrible or worse ones, particularly in regard to the equality/impartiality of the judicial system... and it continues to promote such inequalities.  While I like to be specific about wording, fact of the matter is modern day ""feminism"" is more often than not simply poorly concealed misandry.  TL,DR; modern day ""feminism"" has ""accomplished"" creating a biased, discriminatory society and culture.  edit: I said I wouldn't start fights in this sub and I meant it. However, I would like to let the downvoters who simply downvote based on opinion and no valid reason know that I think poorly of them, and their lives are worthless in my eyes.

Modern feminism seems to be highly authoritarian, take for example mandated quotas for women in STEM and boardrooms, or manspreading laws.  Sure their ideas on gender roles are slightly libertarian, but they don't actually affect legislature, we already had the freedom to reject gender roles.  Additionally they tend to praise femininity everywhere and masculinity in women, but are highly critical of masculinity in men, so instead of actually dismantling gender roles they are attempting to create a new standard of what is socially acceptable.  Of course, ideas of masculinity and femininity are highly subjective and if you asked a feminist about what constitutes either you would get a very different opinion than from someone who considers themself egalitarian."

So in this example, black people can be racist in a black neighborhood because that is their power in terms of social capital and etc.  Honestly, it's complicated and people try to simplify it too much, but your answer is yes.

TiADiscussion,3akog3,ArchangelleDovakin,11,Sun Jun 21 04:27:16 2015 UTC,"Well, depends on how you would define groups. There is very little in common between our current group and first wave feminism for example. The current group is mostly focused on intersectional oppression, the first wave had the backing of the KKK focused on getting booze banned. The right to vote was a side effect because women at the time were much more likely to vote in favor of banning the sale of alcohol and could be better leveraged as a political bloc. Not to mention the entire white feather campaign. I guess being connected to prohibition, the klan and lobbying to set up the draft generally are things groups try to distance themselves from so it's rarely mentioned unless you look for it.  Second wave feminism, was the origin of what we think of feminism. It has the creation of academic feminism, radical feminism, the patriarchy and is heavily influenced by Marxist thinkers. I would generally lump second and third wave feminism in together because third wave feminism's only major difference is the inclusion of intersectionality in addition patriarchy theory because of the recognition that feminism up to this point had been pretty focused on white women issues."
TiADiscussion,3akog3,HiddenHerald,6,Sun Jun 21 08:02:54 2015 UTC,"first wave had the backing of the KKK focused on getting booze banned. The right to vote was a side effect because women at the time were much more likely to vote in favor of banning the sale of alcohol and could be better leveraged as a political bloc.   That's an extremely disingenuous interpretation of how women got the right to vote, and suffrage wasn't the first or only legal inequality they overturned (in fact, it was one of the last). The KKK didn't see an influx of temperance women and spontaneously say ""we should give them the vote because they'll vote for temperance!"" For one, the KKK wasn't the the origin of the temperance more movement and wasn't the most important organization in that movement, and for a second, the suffragists already had a movement independent of temperance. This is also a very US centric view, since the UK was where a lot of early feminist thought and agitation happened and where propertied women first gained enfranchisement, tho I think they had universal suffrage a few years after the US.  The first wave of feminism wasn't all Christian conservatives, either. Early feminists like Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony argued for the universal human rights for women and blacks alike from a secular ""natural rights"" perspective that posited that women should not only have equality under the law with men, but also that women and men were fundamentally equal. Their organization's support for black rights and their antebellum support for abolition cause a huge rift in early feminism and the suffrage movement, and it was their brand of radicalism that would later incorporate academic rigor to become second wave feminism. Therefore all three waves have a strong link tying them together, as you've already accepted that the third wave is an extension of the second."
TiADiscussion,3akog3,ArchangelleDovakin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Oh no I totally get that. I would go so far as to say that second wave feminism exists because of the downfall of the Klan and the start of the civil rights movement along with some self reflection about how the first wave treated minorities. Not to mention it was a good political move to try and swell their numbers. Also yes there were people in the first wave who were not horribly bigots, but even by the standards of the early 20th century the suffragettes were pretty frigging racist.  And yes I am a bit biased to the US perspective."
TiADiscussion,3akog3,HiddenHerald,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. Modern feminism often has very little to do with equality, or women's rights. I'd argue they are if anything the exact opposites of the original women's rights movements, who simply wanted equality.  ""Modern feminism"" is little more than a mockery of the original, and ""feminism"" is merely a title being used in this regard, having been given new meaning in modern times. Modern feminism has very little to do with equality (at least on a legal basis) and everything to do with grabbing more ""rights"" over the other gender, which is a disgusting abuse of the title and of equality itself.  The original feminists got women some defense against career discrimination, the right to vote, etc, etc... in other words, they leveled the playing field. ""Modern-day feminists"" are to thank for the current mess of a legal system we have in place for accusations of domestic abuse/rape, and the decidedly biased courts for divorce, child support, and custody battles...

What really annoys me is how the have managed to convince so many people that they are feminists by giving them the dictionary definition, and telling them that if they aren't feminists, they are misogynists.  It's not hate to disagree with an ideology.  Imagine if Marxists went around telling people that Marxism is the belief that working class people deserve the same rights as wealthy people, completely leaving out all the stuff about state control of assets and means of production, and as a result any criticism was met with denouncing that person as a capitalist pig."

We classify in many different respects, usually as a result of our judgments of salience.  We don't just choose to classify people as male or female. Rather the male/female distinction genuinely is an important one given human interests. It's not that we just picked it out of a hat or something."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,uptotwentycharacters,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:13:22 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's an arbitrary decision. I'm saying we choose to classify people as male or female because it's a useful distinction.
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,MosDaf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well, its not merely useful, its true. That is to say, there is a real, biologically important distinction between male and female. Pure science doesn't care about what's useful, just about what's true.  If we didn't recognize the male/female distinction, that would mean that we'd basically be clueless about much about biology.   We don't really choose to distinguish between male and female any more than we choose to distinguish between rocks and cows. In fact, we probably couldn't ""choose"" not to no matter how hard we tried. The distinction is real, and forces itself on us as one of the very first facts about human biology that we recognize. Hope that doesn't come across as overly contentious, but its actually a pretty important point."

TiADiscussion,3ag99p,FlaredPants,25,Sat Jun 20 15:38:02 2015 UTC,The whole point of intersectionality is that different groups of women face different sets of problems. You're using the founding principle of the idea to critique it.
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lifeonthegrid,12,Fri Jun 19 23:38:42 2015 UTC,Well that's the idea but isn't its main use for privileged upper-middle class women who write blogs to claim they're oppressed?

TiADiscussion,3ag99p,inyouraeroplane,6,Sat Jun 20 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's a token attempt though. Feminism is still for middle-class white women, it's just saying ""But I have black friends!"" now."

TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lauchs,11,Sat Jun 20 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"A fair point, but I would argue those attempts to address that aren't successful.  One of the things that was constantly brought up is ""hierarchies"" but with the oppression olympics even feminism seems to operate on a hierarchy. White vs. PoC, Straight vs. LGBT, disabled vs. able, etc...  Feminism can't have it both ways.  E: you were downvoted for breaking the circlejerk smh."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lifeonthegrid,8,Sat Jun 20 00:44:19 2015 UTC,"Different women face fundamentally different issues. That doesn't mean feminism can't address fundamentally different problems. And while you may believe that the attempts made to address it haven't been successful, it doesn't mean people should stop trying or that the cause is somehow invalid.   It's not oppression olympics to say ""As a group, gay people are discriminated against in society and straight people are not"" or ""As a group, disabled people are discriminated against in society and able bodied people are not"". It's not a competition, it's a statement of fact."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lauchs,7,Sat Jun 20 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"True, feminism can deal with fundamentally different problems. That being said how many times have you seen predominantly first world problems, eg, the door holding, vs most people in that gender studies class wearing clothes that were made by mostly exploited female workers in sweatshops.   In my mind, until feminism rhetoric attacks these sorts of issues as strongly as say manspreading, I find it morally hypocritical."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lifeonthegrid,8,Sat Jun 20 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is that people tend to focus on problems in their society, since those are the ones they are most likely to experience and be able to have an impact on. Especially for problems that are relatively simple. I don't see this same argument being made about people who care about the environment and focus on cleaning up a local park instead of stopping global warming.   Is it hypocritical? It depends on who you ask and what their views on sweatshops are. It's a complicated economic issue. But calling people hypocrites for talking about sexism in their own society and not engaging with the issue of 3rd world sweatshop labor reeks of ""whataboutism"".   Lastly, there's plenty of feminist rhetoric that does attack economic exploitation of women, both domestically and in the third world. It's been around well before the first manspreading thinkpiece."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,lauchs,12,Sat Jun 20 03:19:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, your environmental example is perfect.   If most environmentalists complained about North American parks being dirty and drove to their meetings in SUVs (like wearing shirts made by exploited women) I wouldn't be very impressed with their environmentalism.   Most serious environmental groups don't spend their efforts picking up litter. They do occasionally, but most efforts are spent on larger, systemic global issues. Feminism does spend a lot of attention, focus and energy on those rich North American parks.   I don't care if it's your society and it affects you, if your goal is to make women equal, then focusing on the richest women on the planet doesn't really pull at my heartstrings.   One of the reasons Men's Rights Activists are reviled by feminists is because there is an understanding that women have it tougher than men so we should focus on women's issues. Why is this logic  completely ignored when it comes to the majority of women stuck in the developing world?  Sweatshops are somewhat complicated but only because we allow them to be. At the end of the day, if it became uncool to wear things produced by modern day slaves who occasionally burn to death making our clothes, sweatshops would stop. If we demanded that our shirts were made by people paid not North American wages, sure, but more than a few pennies a shirt, and argued half as loudly as we do when Marvel doesn't make a Black Widow toy, we'd have this problem licked.  While yes, there is some rhetoric, in mainstream media, (I'm thinking NYT, Slate, Huffington Post etc) there are significantly more articles about relatively trivial offenses, vs things that exploit women and perpetuate that exploitation."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,garybuseysawakening,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"There's a world of difference between SUVs and buying t-shirts from sweatshop labor in terms of their respective problems.   Your main problem is assuming that everyone who is interested/concerned with a problem, i.e the environment or gender equality, must do so as part of a serious group. However, this is not the case. I can be aware of casual sexism and discrimination in my own society and be a feminist, the same way I can recycle and drive an energy efficient car and care about the environment. You don't need to work exclusively on a single large scale issue.   The fact of the matter is most people aren't qualified to deal with the most pressing issue. I think the environment is an important issue. However, I'm recognize that there are professionals who've spent their whole lives working on and studying these issues and probably have a much better understanding of it than I do. So I'll let them take the lead on solving the big problems and I'll make sure my office recycles.   Bringing it back to sweatshops,  most freshman sitting in a gender studies course (which is the scenario that set this all off) lack the knowledge of economics, global trade policy, the politics, economies and cultures of the countries where these sweatshops exist, to be leaders on the fight for sweatshops.   Sweatshops are complicated not because we want them to be, but because of globalization. Require too many protections in one country and production can just up and move to another, poorer country with less regulations, taking the primary source of income for any number of families with it. Sweatshops are a way of life for many people now and it's a delicate situation. I can confidently claim that it's bullshit that there's no Black Widow toy without impacting anyone's livelihood. I can't confidently claim that there's a simple solution to worker exploitation in the age of globalization and mass poverty.   MRA's are reviled by feminists not because they claim men have issues, but because enough of them claim that men have it WORSE than women and focus primarily on anti-feminism instead of men's issues. And it's a different situation than the one you're complaining. Comparing two different problems in one society is different than comparing two different problems in two completely different societies. I also disagree with your categorization of women in America as the ""richest women on the planet"" given how many Americans are in poverty in today, especially in comparison to similar countries.    If you're getting your feminism exclusively from the media, then you're going to be getting exclusively the feminism that sells ads and gets page clicks. An article on ""manspreading"" is clickbait, it's a stupid and controversial piece that will draw much more attention than a radical feminist critique of capitalism. There's a whole world of academic feminism, and plenty of important works and ideas that you won't find making headline that are still important and discussed within the context of feminism.   Lastly, this all started about when someone complained about intersectionality. The entire point of intersectionality is to teach feminists about multiple modes of oppression and that different women face different challenges based on their identities outside of womanhood. So complaining that feminists don't focus on the big picture when someone is defending the idea that's supposed to do that is short sighted."
TiADiscussion,3ag99p,magikorpse,6,Sat Jun 20 06:52:39 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I never knew the other side to the MRA story, so thanks for the lesson! I was wrong and in retrospect I think my understanding of that may have been nothing more than speculation. Though, I do think some members have gone too far as I have seen videos of guys who start their meetings by talking about how women's issues are more significant. Much appreciated!  I do not at all believe that everyone who wants to express interest must do so as part of a serious group. However, if you are going to act like a serious group and invoke serious language, consequences, campaigns, firings in the name of equality, then yes, I'd like you to think about how that power is being used.   ""f you're getting your feminism exclusively from the media, then you're going to be getting exclusively the feminism that sells ads and gets page clicks."" For me, this is the largest problem. The feminism that most people see and interact with is rife with specious reasoning, an almost vapid sense of self interest and a terrifying aura of righteousness. I mean, the very first search result for manspreading got me this ""Entire blogs have been created to document the culprits who don’t comply. Even actor Tom Hanks was publicly shamed, being called the “new face of manspreading.” Hanks excused himself, saying that the “train was half empty.”"" (granted, it's a loaded search team, but I think it highlights the problem) I wish real feminists would call this nonsense out. If you feel it is silly, say something. Let people know this doesn't represent feminism.    People do devote time, energy and effort into these causes, that don't even deal with real issues. If it's a hobby, fine. But read the anger and dismissiveness of even a casual glance of shitredditsays. It's a tone of ""those people are just the worst human beings ever"" ALL THE WHILE WEARING CLOTHES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY MADE WITH BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS FROM WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  Yes. I find there is something hypocritical there. I wouldn't give much credence to what a slave owning plantation owner had to say about equality and I don't think we're that much removed.  ""I can confidently claim that it's bullshit that there's no Black Widow toy without impacting anyone's livelihood. I can't confidently claim that there's a simple solution to worker exploitation in the age of globalization and mass poverty.""  This pair of sentences works as a great demonstration to me. The Black Widow toy decision was made by a profit seeking company, with market research, not a nonsensical anti woman vendetta. They didn't make a Hawkeye toy either. Inexplicably, the least powerful avengers don't have toys. They also don't have long running comics either. Weird yeah? Does the company owe you that toy?   Meanwhile, sweatshops exist because we don't talk about them every day. If every week a new anti sweatshop tweet happened, if even a tenth of the zeal with which we chase, attack and often destroy people for their dongle jokes, a shirt from a friend or an insensitive tweet. If any of this rage and self righteous fury were directed at sweatshops, we could end it. Brands could, and would, because capitalism does nothing better than respond to market demands, make a niche with well treated foreign factories. Livestream the damn thing if you have to. People want organic food more than they care about slaves. Everyone who was shocked, just shocked by 12 years a slave while wearing sweatshop labour... I mean, it's crazy. It's ridiculous. And this is women and children. Who desperately need help. And you're letting bullshit feminism take the mainstage instead? And in a lot of corners of reddit I'm probably seen as the misogynist asshole for pointing this out?  If people tweeted, tumblrd, reddited, protested, rallied, got celebrity support (ie, the things modern feminism is great at) there would be a market demand and we could see change. But instead, we get blogs about manspreading.  Feminism is the media darling and it is being wasted chasing nonsense! Feminism did amazing things, from suffrage to being treated generally as equals. Now that legacy is being used to pursue the most mundane and ultimately superficial ends instead of actually fighting for equality. It seems easy and selfish. Feminists before fought for voting rights, to be accepted into universities and all jobs and now, instead of fighting for the women they themselves exploit, are taking the moral highground about comedy and, ironically, apparel?  Additionally, I think things like the wage gap are as complex if not more so than sweatshops. And when minor issue feminism dominates the conversation it is hard to have a real conversation about solutions. The wage gap is a hugely complex economic  phenomenon without simple answers. Even just a part of it, maternity leave, is a hugely complex issue. As long as maternal leave is more common than paternal leave, it will affect how a business hires, or more commonly, promotes. My office does a year and a half maternity leave. I'd guess more than half of them have two or more kids. That's a huge business cost. For them as well. A woman with three kids has almost lost half a decade of work experience and promotions. Dealing with that is some interesting economics and as you put it ""I'm recognize that there are professionals who've spent their whole lives working on and studying these issues and probably have a much better understanding of it than I do. So I'll let them take the lead on solving the big problems""   Or, endlesly misues the 78 cents on the dollar stat over and over again.   The idea of intersectionality as you express it sounds great. It sounds a lot like empathy. But, if you don't think women in America are the ""richest women on the planet"" than I'm not sure about that empathy. About a third of women live India and China. To say that life in America is in any way even remotely as hard as life is there is mind boggling. Yes, compared to the top 20% of the world, some American women are probably near the bottom. But the difference between there and even half way is worlds apart."

Your statement seems to be trying to say:  ""Straight people aren't discriminated against for being gay""  Well of course not, they're straight.

Being an amateur that relies on tropes is not the same as being a sexist.  Neither is being a movie director or studio head that only cares about putting out movies that test well and will bring in the box office numbers.  Not everything is written to carry some great message, or to be a magnum opus, either.  If you think it is, why don't you head on down to the fucking romance section of your local book store.  Tropes are frequently deployed in horror (and action) movies because these movies are rarely about the characters or story.  They're about monsters, or seeing things explode.  Similar thing with romance movies and even books.  Video games looking for a quick easy justification and motivation for their main characters to have will go for those tropes as well.  Remember, the main point of many video games is to play them.  To shoot things, to disembowel things, to come out ahead of other players, to take on some sort of challenging gameplay and come out on top.  Many times the stories will be nothing but lazy justifications for that gameplay.  This does not make the writing any sort of -ist.  It makes the writing secondary to the gameplay, and perhaps almost certainly devoid of any great meaning.  And don't try to play ""it doesn't matter what the author intended, other people are getting this message out of what they wrote.""  If you want to play the ""Death of the Author"" argument, you can't hold the author responsible for what others see in their writing.  If the writers views, beliefs, and intentions with his writings do not matter when talking about the messages that writing holds, then that writing does not reflect the views, beliefs, and intentions that the writer holds.  It's a two way street.  You can't say their intentions don't matter to what the writing actually says, while also saying that the writing secretly reflects their intentions!  It doesn't work that way!  None of this works that way!"
TiADiscussion,3aijva,Gyroo-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this you really nailed it.  I see a lot of anti-gamergaters saying that if you want games to be treated as an art from then don't complain when it is subject to criticism.  The problem is that a lot of criticism is just simply not valid, especially regarding sexism.  It's very easy for critics to make an argument interpreting a game as sexist, but a lot of the time their criticism comes down to ""female character was not empowered enough, therefore misogyny"" or ""player can do kill/shoot/dismember women, therefore misogyny"", which can almost always be flipped on their head to interpret the game as  misandric.  It's disappointing that this is happening because almost everyone just wants more well written female characters, however we're stifled by feminists insisting that any women must be a caricature of the ideal empowered woman, and must have no body parts exposed or be sexualised in any way.  The only safe option left is a female Islamist insurgent dressed in a burqa.  Tropes Are Not Bad seems to be increasingly relevant in these sorts of discussions, especially regarding games where plot is not really the main focus."
TiADiscussion,3aijva,Thanatar18,2,Sun Jun 21 13:06:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Is it sexist? It could be argued yes, as you pointed out.  Similarly, it could be pointed out that the prevalence of self-sacrificing male supporting characters is also sexist promoting such a role, or perhaps that the presentation of certain (predominantly male) characters as brutish and aggressive is sexist. I won't deny that the ""damsel in distress"" trope is certainly more common, but overall I suppose my point is it's not really harmful.  I suppose a better way to phrase it would be that it's not so much sexist as it is stereotypical; there's a fine line of difference in that sexism denotes discrimination of some sort, which is lacking in this context. Personally, as an asian I myself don't have the best opinion of stereotypes and they're annoying as hell, but even then they're certainly not racist/sexist.  To be honest, I'm gonna go the next step forward and say I actually enjoy the feminist frequency series by Sarkeesian. I might not care for her giving gaming a bad rep (IMO) in mainstream media, and originally I actually despised her as I saw her as criticizing everything I considered my childhood, but in all honesty, she's never stated that such games should not exist. (for the record, I stay away from GamerGate in general, though I enjoy things from both sides of the argument)  Anyways, TL,DR; it's not sexist, it's stereotypical; personally I don't see harm in it as people are free to make what they want and enjoy what they want."
TiADiscussion,3aijva,Mouon,5,Sun Jun 21 11:44:09 2015 UTC,"So I hope we can mostly agree that heavy handed use of the damsel in distress trope is a little sexist   I don't see how its sexist for a female character to be saved by a man in a story.    because she's just kind of an agencyless placeholder (or a character reduced to one) needs to be rescued by a knight in shining armor   The thing is this isn't actually whats happening in stories when people say it is. And when it is, its pretty trivial and benign.   It really just doesn't matter whether someone saves themselves, or is saved by someone else, or who they are saved by. If a woman is saved by a man in a story, it doesn't mean that all women need to be saved. Feminists just read sexism into trivial and benign things, because they are looking to see it everywhere since it justifies their ideology for there to be sexism everywhere, and since there isn't, they need to interpret it in."

The reason these ""issues"" are so trivial is because everything is taken in the context of the game: Mario saves Peach, The End. It's not Mario saves Peach--a woman--because he is a man, reflective of society's sexist culture. Who thinks like that?  If you're bringing up a point that nobody outside of social justice circles ever thinks or worries about, I think it's more a case of overanalysis than some subconscious culturing by the sexist patriarchy. You could argue that most people are ignorant (i.e., they don't consume media critically), but I would argue that ignorance is exactly why it's so trivial in the first place.  I highly doubt most women would take issue when the (fictional) character in distress is a woman. If you told a woman ""But look at how women are being portrayed!"" I would bet that their response would be ""It's just a video game."" If the targets (women) of the negative aspects of sexism (e.g., Peach is the weak woman who needs saving) don't care, how could it be anything but trivial?"

Should we also point out that there is something wrong with a man being the primary villain in these kinds of games?  Most men don't care that male characters always seem to be the villains because it's just a video game. Same with women and damsels in distress. Sure, there might be something wrong, but it's an issue that is rightly deemed trivial by many and only has relevance in social justice discussions.  If you want to extend the relevance of female depictions in fantasy media to real-life, I would like to see relevant research showing how women are at all affected by stories like Peach's or Zelda's."

There's multiple representations of men, so they aren't defined solely by their gender. But when there's only one woman in the story and she's defined by her gender and her helplessness, over and over and over again, it sucks.   People repeating the same basic structure over and over again isn't just a matter of social justice, it's a matter of interesting story telling. Plenty of people don't want to see the same plot rehashed for the umpteenth time with no variation.   Peach and Zelda have long histories with numerous iterations, some better than others. But they matter less as individual stories than they do as part of the much larger collection of stories, which IME, strongly favors male protagonists and damsels in distress."

My problem is that it's taken as a social justice issue at all. It sucks? For who? I don't care about the feelings of a fictional character, and I won't extend the depictions of people I see in video games to real people. Most people keep the fantasy in their screens.  Even if Peach is defined by her helplessness and gender, that's one particular woman (as opposed to ""women"") being represented that way. Since she's not even real, it's hard for me to see why it should be considered a problem beyond boring storytelling."

TiADiscussion,3aijva,Mouon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"Sex and gender, while separate things are interwoven in that those of the male gender tend to have brain patterns and behaviours different from those of women due to their sex, and vice versa. Different tendencies among men and women are caused by sex, to a significant degree. Sure theres made up fluff round the edges, like whether men wear trousers or kilts or whatever, or women wearing skirts or dresses or whatever, but the causal connection from sex to gender is there.  Now, based on that, it becomes clear that men acting in certain ways and thinking in certain kinds of ways, and women acting and thinking in certain kinds of ways, differently, naturally leads to a tendency for men and women to naturally fit into certain different social roles without socialization, just due to innate tendencies. This was observed in the Israeli Kibbutz whereby they brought up boys and girls the same but boys end girls always acted different.    Therefore, gender roles to a significant degree are not something we need to purge from the minds of people in society, but rather men and women acting as they naturally do. Sure in the past it was to a significant degree imposed, and sure there are bullshit rituals etc associated with gender, but gender roles are not something we need to purge from society, not at all.  Therefore, the trope of men saving damsels in distress in games and films is more them just responding to demand that is rooted in natural tendencies to some degree (like desiring to protect women and women liking women who can protect them), and lazy unoriginal game developers, but its not a problem to be solved at all. There is no problem."

TiADiscussion,3aijva,sugar_bottom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Regardless of my personal feelings on it, I would submit the argument that the ""damsel in distress"" is a useful stand-in to create the Hero's Journey quest archetype.  For various reasons, this quest fits nicely into the video game format and allows for character development of the main character, which is the focus of story-heavy video games: there is internal reflection and a change within the main character (the same way the hero's journey creates this in written stories).    Unfortunately, this may leave said damsel as a poorly developed, flat character.  This could be due to time constraints, or purposely done since the focus of the story is elsewhere (likely on the main character).  There's nothing wrong with having a flat character to drive the plot or to complement more highly developed characters.   Ideally, (at least, for some people), a well-developed narrative-driven game would develop both the damsel and the main character.  I don't play enough of those style of games to really speak to that, but I'm sure our resident gamers can come up with some examples.  Anyway, that would be my argument.  It's a plot device, and there's nothing inherently wrong or misogynistic in that."

The concept was introduced by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), who described the basic narrative pattern as follows:  A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.

TiADiscussion,3aijva,Gyroo-,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"In the case where there isn't really much of a narrative it definitely isn't sexist.  The trope is used as a generic call to action, and because it is so well known and used, the player instantly understands that the objective, narrative wise, is to rescue the damsel.  The games that use it are usually older games that were highly mechanical in nature, for example the mario series.  In this case I don't think it is fair to criticism the use of this trope, or its repeated use over multiple games, as the game is focused heavily on mechanics.  I agree that in games that have more narrative elements like Heavy Rain, the trope will be used to get an emotional response from the player.  Sarkeesian says that the damsel in distress creates a male power fantasy that alienates a female audience, and this is sexist against women.  I believe that she is wrong that it creates a male power fantasy; It is simply taking advantage of the fact that a stronger emotional response can be generated by putting a female character in danger than a male one, and the emotional reaction will be similar to both male and female players.  There are two possible ways to see this: either male characters being in dangerous situations is so common in video games that the player will not exhibit an emotional response to this, or the player, not the developer is sexist in some way, and the developer is taking advantage of this to get an emotional response, most likely because the majority of players (male or female) are conditioned to feel more empathy towards women.  In regards to the agency of characters, to say that it is bad for a female (or male) character to have their agency removed is to deny the antagonist any agency.  Remember that death is the ultimate denial of agency, so what can the antagonist really do to characters in the narrative if they are forbidden from removing agency?  What can you really do with a female character if you criticize any character flaws or plot events that detriment them?  Also, to deny a single female character agency is not to suggest that women are not agents.  A female player will project themselves into the character just as a male player would, it is not really the avatar that is the agent, the player themself is the agent.  To say that women are denied agency in video games is to say that women are incapable of playing."

Just say something about how terms have to be used casually to be de stigmatized and have their power stolen, that this fellow shouldn't speak for racial groups that they aren't a part of, call them a white saviour that doesn't believe in linguistic drift if you want to start a fight, and then say that no malicious intent was there in the use of the word, it's a casual joke among friends, and that maybe this person should focus on the actual active racial injustices that exist in the world.   Personally if I'm gonna say something that's a racial slur I try make sure I'm with people who'll roll with it and understand the joke I'm making or I preface my statement making sure people know there isn't any actual negative intent."

I've almost completely resorted to posting all my opinions on sociopolitical subjects to secret right-wing groups. I find them to be largely reasonable except on a few topics where we pretty sharply disagree. Most notably: transgenderism, immigration, and abortion. Also on topics of religion and ""degeneracy"" (whatever that means lol.)  It really didn't use to be this way. I used to feel perfectly fine hanging out with other liberals, who were fairly open minded and actually had a decent sense of humor. Now any joke, no matter how innocuous, is a micro-aggression and makes you ""scum."" I am patriarchal shitlord and a rapist, who needs to repent for his sins, and bow down before the mighty POC, etc etc.   It's quiet unbelievable what happened to some people after they went full SJW. Real shame, honestly. These days I triple check I'm surrounded by right-wingers before I make any joke about anything."
TiADiscussion,3abrcg,positif_,12,Fri Jun 19 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"It's because the left has come to the point where safety or perceived safety is conflicting with freedom (of speech). Once staunch defenders of freedom of speech beyond governmental protection, they are now embracing ""safety"" and ""comfort"" over liberty, and thus they have backslided on their commitment to free speech (nowadays a common statement from them is ""freedom of speech only protects you from getting arrested""), mostly due to the efforts of feminists, NAACP, etc. who have complained that what appears to be an innocuous joke reflects very dangerous attitudes like sexism or racism, and don't understand that you don't have to actually endorse a viewpoint to make a joke about it. Their basic argument is that offensive jokes are essentially ""fighting words"" because they incite hatred towards minorities and if people laugh, those minorities have to worry if they'll get lynched, raped, etc. because they have an audience that condones someone making fun at their expense.  Right-wingers, on the other hand, don't give a shit about offending people- being nasty towards people not like them is what they do. That's why you see them being more supportive of those same offensive stuff that the left gets outraged over even if it's not friendly to conservatives- they're applauding people who, like them, is willing to say ""fuck you"" to the outrage brigade within the left, irrespective of their own views."

Yeah I find this to be insanely ridiculous. If making fun of = lynching, then I must constantly be wishing death upon all my friends and relatives. It's incredible that these people can't understand that sarcasm/humor =/= hate.   As much as I am supportive of transgender rights, Caitlyn Jenner is not a holy figure. She is not above criticism, ridicule, or sarcasm just like the rest of us. And neither are black people or other so-called ""protected"" groups. I am treating them no differently than I would treat anyone else, instead of putting them up on a pedestal and worshiping them. I guess that makes me an awful bigot."
TiADiscussion,3abrcg,positif_,9,Fri Jun 19 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"A perfect example of this would be the Daniel Tosh incident in 2012. The exchange went something like this:  Tosh, while in the middle of doing a stand-up comedy show: ""People say you can't joke about rape. Why not? Rape is hilarious!"" (that line actually is very close to a line used by George Carlin, before he made jokes about ""rape culture"" and the ""asking for it"" defense)  Girl: ""Rape jokes aren't funny!""  Tosh: ""Wouldn't it be funny if she were raped by 5 guys, like right now?""  There was a huge uproar over it among SJW circles, and their primary argument is that Tosh used ""fighting words"" to incite the crowd into raping her, and that because he ""thinks rape is funny"", he would condone it if some people from the audience were to actually rape her. Feminists have said that threatening rape, even in jest, like that is commonly used as a tool to silence women who dared to challenge men. They fail to understand that you don't have to endorse a viewpoint to make a joke about it. Besides an apology, nothing happened to Tosh; he got to keep appearing at comedy clubs and kept his TV show with Comedy Central. But you could imagine what it could to someone less respected and renowned.  Nowadays, the left views free speech as an annoyance. They repeatedly reiterate that free speech is only there to keep you from getting arrested for saying something, and that all their outrage and intimidation is righteous. Anytime someone defends an offensive statement using what they call the ""free speech argument"", they get pissed, because they don't want any free speech protection beyond not getting arrested (and that, only because they know nobody will change that part of the Constitution). Why? Because they want people to lose their careers over microaggressions.  As for their view of comedy, they see it as fulfilling a social purpose of making fun of the privileged and powerful. They cannot stand it if a minority gets made fun of, because it goes against their perceived ""purpose"" of comedy. They often point to George Carlin, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert as an example of great comedians because of their left-wing views, but they forget those comedians loathed political correctness as well and even made fun of the PC brigade at times."
TiADiscussion,3abrcg,hfwang18,4,Fri Jun 19 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"Why? Because they want people to lose their careers over microaggressions.   I think another facet of the problem (from the perspective of TiA'ers, at least) is that the consequences only cut in one direction.  To cite one recent example, there was that Brit scientist (a Nobel laureate!) who said men and women working together in the lab can lead to romantic complications. A rad-fem shitstorm ensued and said prof was forced to resign.  Just weeks earlier, a female Brit uni official (the ""diversity officer,"" lol) tweeted her approval of killing all white men, and she gets to keep her job."

A lot of the people posting were actually female science majors (yes, at my school, even sorority girls and engineering students are often SJWs), which lent them credibility, but I thought they were jokes not to be taken seriously, and that females in STEM are generally hardier than what typical SJWs make them out to be."

TiADiscussion,3abrcg,blessedbyyeezus,8,Fri Jun 19 04:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I disagree that transitioning makes you 100000%x more likely to kill yourself. I think being hated, vilified, and ridiculed by your family, closest friends and the entire world is what drives those people to suicide. Waking up every morning and seeing something you wish you weren't, etc. It all piles up and takes a toll over time.   As far as recruiting, I sort of understand where you're coming from. Actually being non-binary is extremely rare. Last time I checked, only 1 in 30,000 people are born transgender. That amounts to like 0.00003% of the population, and yet somehow a bunch of 20-something girls on my newsfeed and 100% of tumblr users are transgender these days. Something clearly doesn't add up. But I think it's just a gimmick for the pretend-trans people. To show the world just how much they are against the evil cisnormative, white supermacist, capitalist patriarchy and whatnot.

The truly sick part is that in both cases, these pretenders attack real sufferers because they're icky and weird.   Seriously, these kids just have way too much time on their hands.

As for the red pill, its a hateful ideology which manipulates men whove had bad experiences with women or bitter from their lack of success, and lure them in with self-improvement rhetoric to an ideolgy that demonizes women. It isn't something characteristic of the right as a whole at all, and you can't judge the right by it.

I feel like for transgender people we have all sorts of reasons why it's more or less valid to be transgender but I don't think those reasons have been finalized once and for all. I also don't think that people are accepting of transgender people because of those reasons. They are accepting because we've reached the right point as a society. The majority of people just don't care if people want to live as and transition to another gender.  I think a lot of people are wondering why someone can't live as and transition to another race.   It's similar to being transgender because it's a live and let live question. It's dissimilar because the reasons provided to support transgender status don't carry over.  But at the end of the day I think the question still stands. Not as some ""gotcha trannys!"" aha moment. But as a live and let live question. The arguments against transracial...ness sound very similar to the arguments made against being transgender by TERFs.   At the end of the day I don't really care because I'm not trans anything or against trans anything. But I'm not finding the definitiveness in these arguments that others seem to. I think live and let live. Why can't someone (assuming they don't commit fraud) live as someone of another race?"

So, since we've aligned the idea that gender is ultimately meaningless using the same terminology by which race is also meaningless, then we line the up question of if one can be discounted why can't the other? Never mind the real target of gender as a social construct is gender roles. Never mind that the race as a social construct has been rolled along to discount various racist bullshit over the years.

The fact that the mainstream transgender conversation got so far away from the science was really disheartening to see. I've seen two articles saying that transracial and transgenderism are different because race and sex are scientifically different.

I like the term “genetic groups” since the term “race” is wildly misleading, and “ethnicity” is more to do with culture.   Though any significance in the difference is not proven, there is a difference between average brain size between whites and blacks  however, the differences are not as striking or as obvious as with men and women, and there’s obviously a lot of misrepresentation and pseudoscience regarding this very politically charged issue.  It also seems counter intuitive to me that the idea that there are more pronounced biological differences between men and women, and that race is a social construct, would be arguments in favour of transsexualism and against transracialism. One would think that the differences in race being primarily cultural or cosmetic would make transitioning more viable.  I grew up here in South Africa, and have seen plenty of black people with whiter skin than mine and blonde hair. They’re called albinos, but they don’t disprove the idea that Africans have darker skin. I hope you aren’t going to pretend that there are no racial stereotypes in America, or that they don’t generally apply to any real people, even if they are exaggerated.  I don’t care if people call me a racist. A huge amount of people from all over the world call me a racist for being born a white South African. I got beat up at school on a regular basis by kids I’d never met because “whites are racist”. Go to Tumblr, or any sociology department at a major university, and you’ll see the idea that all whites are racist no matter what they do is regarded as a legitimate theory, despite its seeming hypocrisy.

Brain size of article  Race and intelligence:       A number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group.  And some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between Africans, Europeans and Asians. J. P. Rushton has argued that Africans on average have smaller brain cases and brains than Europeans, and that this is evidence that the gap is biological in nature. Critics of Rushton have argued that Rushton's arguments rest on outdated data collected by unsound methods and should be considered invalid.  Recent reviews by Nisbett et al. (2012b) and Mackintosh (2011) consider that current data does show an average difference in brain size and head-circumference between American Blacks and Whites, but question whether this has any relevance for the IQ gap. Nesbitt et al. argue that crude brain size is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ, for example brain size also differs between men and women, but without well documented differences in IQ. At the same time newborn Black children have the same average brain size as Whites, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in postnatal environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect Black children.      Relevant: William H.

Now merely acknowledging them makes you evil.

Also, Jim Crow didn’t take all rights away from blacks, it gave whites and blacks different rights according to their race, just like affirmative action.   Yep   Remember, it’s wrong to judge all black people on the behaviour of a few. It’s fine to judge all white people on the behaviour of a few a hundred plus years ago. Also, having pride in your race is stupid because you had nothing to do with it, but you should feel shame for all the bad stuff your race did. Even though every civilisation in history invaded land and practiced slavery, whites are uniquely culpable for it, even though they started the abolitionist movement and rolled back their system of colonialism.    Not to mention, well... anyone who is at all curious should click his username."

There are plenty of examples of fantastically successful ""collectivist"" laws, like the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, which demonstrate how reasonably tailored statutes can be effective even if they rely on some notion of group identity.  As I just posted, America hasn't overcome institutional racism yet by a long shot. Some of the problems might be self-correcting over time, but some almost certainly are not. Take the wealth gap, for instance. The average Black American has one thirteenth the wealth of the average White American, and when they both hand that money down to their children the problem will continue.  A purely individualist approach fails to account for issues like the wealth gap because it doesn't show up when comparing two individuals side by side. It comes from analyzing broad statistical trends among groups, which is what you've defined as ""collectivist.""  None of this is to say individualism is bad, but that the truth lies in the gray area in the middle, not in the black and white picture painted here."

I understand that collectivism isn't always a bad thing, like your point about the civil rights act, but that existed when it was necessary. The whole goal of civil rights was not to be the ""other"", and instead part of the the underlying collectivism of being the nation's people, instead of a separate group in that nation. I guess that's what I meant by individualism, when it comes to a nation- you don't have to do identity politics with people, because you'd all be the same main ""group"", and therefore other things would be your identity.

Racism is at the top right now because of the police brutality going on and the rioting in Ferguson and Baltimore.

Most of the non-radfems I followed were definitely passionate about feminism, but they usually put other issues first.  Occasionally causes move up and down the hierarchy depending on current events, but being a woman generally earns you way fewer oppression points than being another demographic.   Edit: I should also note that homophobia is only ranked above sexism when applied to LGBT+ women. A lot of people are starting to turn on gay men because they think that gay men (especially white and cis ones) are misogynistic. This is thankfully not a very widespread belief even among SJWs, but homophobia against women usually elicits a slightly stronger reaction than homophobia against men."

In my opinion, it's not about making sure the oppressed no longer feel oppressed; it's about making sure the oppressed no longer feel they're alone in being oppressed. Hence, this shaky, manufactured idea of unity. If a supposedly oppressed person is wrong, it's because they were raised to believe that oppression is the only way to live and they should instead join the oppression circle.

I think it’s inspiring how closely we’re all related, not just humans but all forms of life, and how now extinct hominids like Neanderthals live on in a sense with some humans still carrying markings of their genetic legacy. However, our close relation in no way disproves general differences. As we can see with our genetic similarity to our  non-human fellow primates, a little difference can go a long way."

Geneticists call us a “small” species, which sounds like a bad joke  {143}  given that we have infested the planet like roaches. What they mean is that the amount of genetic variation found among humans is what a biologist would expect in a species with a small number of members.5 There are more genetic differences among chimpanzees, for instance, than there are among humans, even though we dwarf them in number. The reason is that our ancestors passed through a population bottleneck fairly recently in our evolutionary history (less than a hundred thousand years ago) and dwindled to a small number of individuals with a correspondingly small amount of genetic variation. The species survived and rebounded, and then underwent a population explosion after the invention of agriculture about ten thousand years ago. That explosion bred many copies of the genes that were around when we were sparse in number; there has not been much time to accumulate many new versions of the genes.  At various points after the bottleneck, differences between races emerged. But the differences in skin and hair that are so obvious when we look at people of other races are really a trick played on our intuitions. Racial differences are largely adaptations to climate. Skin pigment was a sunscreen for the tropics, eyelid folds were goggles for the tundra. The parts of the body that face the elements are also the parts that face the eyes of other people, which fools them into thinking that racial differences run deeper than they really do.6 Working in opposition to the adaptation to local climates, which makes groups different on the skin, is an evolutionary force that makes neighboring groups similar inside. Rare genes can offer immunity to endemic diseases, so they get sucked into one group from a neighboring group like ink on a blotter, even if members of one group mate with members of the other infrequently.7 That is why Jews, for example, tend to be genetically similar to their non-Jewish neighbors all over the world, even though until recently they tended to marry other Jews. As little as one conversion, affair, or rape involving a gentile in every generation can be enough to blur genetic boundaries over time.8  Taking all these processes into account, we get the following picture. People are qualitatively the same but may differ quantitatively. The quantitative differences are small in biological terms, and they are found to a far greater extent among the individual members of an ethnic group or race than between ethnic groups or races. These are reassuring findings. Any racist ideology that holds that the members of an ethnic group are all alike, or that one ethnic group differs fundamentally from another, is based on false assumptions about our biology.  But biology does not let us off the hook entirely. Individuals are not genetically identical, and it is unlikely that the differences affect every part of the body except the brain. And though genetic differences between races and ethnic groups are much smaller than those among individuals, they are not nonexistent (as we see in their ability to give rise to physical differences and to  {144}  different susceptibilities to genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs and sickle cell anemia). Nowadays it is popular to say that races do not exist but are purely social constructions. Though that is certainly true of bureaucratic pigeonholes such as “colored,” “Hispanic,” “Asian/Pacific Islander,” and the one-drop rule for being “black,” it is an overstatement when it comes to human differences in general. The biological anthropologist Vincent Sarich points out that a race is just a very large and partly inbred family. Some racial distinctions thus may have a degree of biological reality, even though they are not exact boundaries between fixed categories. Humans, having recently evolved from a single founder population, are all related, but Europeans, having mostly bred with other Europeans for millennia, are on average more closely related to other Europeans than they are to Africans or Asians, and vice versa. Because oceans, deserts, and mountain ranges have prevented people from choosing mates at random in the past, the large inbred families we call races are still discernible, each with a somewhat different distribution of gene frequencies. In theory, some of the varying genes could affect personality or intelligence (though any such differences would at most apply to averages, with vast overlap between the group members). This is not to say that such genetic differences are expected or that we have evidence for them, only that they are biologically possible.  (My own view, incidentally, is that in the case of the most discussed racial difference — the black-white IQ gap in the United States — the current evidence does not call for a genetic explanation. Thomas Sowell has documented that in most of the twentieth century and throughout the world, ethnic differences in IQ were the rule, not the exception.9 Members of minority groups who were out of the cultural mainstream commonly had average IQs that fell below that of the majority, including immigrants to the United States from southern and eastern Europe, the children of white mountaineers in the United States, children who grew up on canal boats in Britain, and Gaelic-speaking children in the Hebrides. The differences were at least as large as the current black-white gap but disappeared within a few generations. For many reasons, the experience of African Americans in the United States under slavery and segregation is not comparable to those of immigrants or rural isolates, and their transition to mainstream cultural patterns could easily take longer.)10  And then there are the sexes. Unlike ethnic groups and races, in which any differences are biologically minor and haphazard, the two sexes differ in at least one way that is major and systematic: they have different reproductive organs. On evolutionary grounds one might expect men and women to differ somewhat in the neural systems that control how they use those organs — in their sexuality, parental instincts, and mating tactics. By the same logic, one would expect them not to differ as much in the neural systems that deal with  {145}  the challenges both sexes face, such as those for general intelligence (as we will see in the chapter on gender)."

There's no good evidence that racial differences in intelligence are due to natural selection, nor is there reason to expect that they would be. As Pinker says:    In theory, some of the varying genes could affect personality or intelligence (though any such differences would at most apply to averages, with vast overlap between the group members). This is not to say that such genetic differences are expected or that we have evidence for them, only that they are biologically possible.      I also don’t understand the logical leap from “we’re all closely related” to “the genetic differences that do exist therefore have to be solely cosmetic”.   Natural selection puts pressure on racial groups to become more different in their cosmetic (physical) traits in certain environments while it puts pressure on them to become more similar for all other traits. My previous comment with the passage from Pinker explains why.   The difference between the sexes is a single gene- either it is expressed as an X or a Y.   This is flat-out incorrect on more than one level. For one thing, sex differences are not due to a single gene. Secondly, phenotypic differences do not necessarily vary in magnitude in accordance with genetic differences. The phenotypic differences between the sexes are enormous (different organs, different physiology) because the genes are designed specifically towards those outcomes. In contrast, a pair of people could be genetically ""unrelated"" and still look like identical twins or still have very similar minds.   Comparatively, the differences between different biological groups of humans is much larger, even if the majority of variation takes place within groups.   The phenotypic differences between racial groups are much smaller than the phenotypic differences between the sexes. The relative size of genetic differences is mostly irrelevant because they have different roles in each case. Genetic differences between the sexes originated by natural selection. Genetic differences between the races originated by genetic drift first, then natural selection influenced physical traits.   I’m not convinced by the slavery or oppression argument. We don’t see this same trend with Japanese Americans, who have been more oppressed far more recently, or Slavic and Irish populations who have a history of slavery, indentured servitude and discrimination.   The argument is not that slavery or ""oppression"" causes racial differences directly, it's that cultural norms and values differ because of past historical factors. And they are resistant to change. The hyper-honor culture of the black community and the education-oriented cultures of certain Asian communities are sufficient to explain racial differences in intelligence within a given country. This doesn't mean that genetic factors play no role, only that the evidence doesn't call for it.  A good test of the genetic explanation would be to measure whether intelligence varies according to the racial makeup of individuals, e.g. whether people who are 70% black are more intelligent than people who are 90% black, on average. I don't think this would be the case but I'm not aware of any studies that attempt to measure this."
TiADiscussion,3ad785,ParanthropusBoisei,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"I said that differences would be overall, not down to every individual. The different “races” do not have clear borders; it’s more like a fuzzy gradient. I also never said I knew for certain to what extent these differences are biological, only that the idea shouldn’t be dismissed offhand. Also, there is no evidence that humans are equal all over with regard to brain function. We know there are differences between individuals, so there being overall differences between groups is not unthinkable. I have never seen any evidence that all humans are equal with regard to genetic propensity for intelligence or personality, only things like Steven Jay Gould’s “The Mismeasure of Man” where he pokes holes in turn of the century junk science which had its own political agenda.   You are a physical organism. There are no non-physical or spiritual traits.   I was under the impression that the genetic difference between men and women was either an x chromosome or a y chromosome, with different genes being expressed differently depending on this variable. Are you saying it’s down to more than that? I’m no geneticist, and am always happy to be corrected.   phenotypic differences do not necessarily vary in magnitude in accordance with genetic differences.   Unless you want to argue that there can’t be average differences between racial groups with regard to intelligence or demeanour, in which case the lack of variation in the human genome is apparently paramount.   I fail to see how genetic drift in tandem with natural selection would produce differences smaller than natural selection by itself. Obviously the difference between male and female has a much longer history than between different population groups. My point was never that men and women are less different than whites and blacks, only that the difference in both cases was genetic. Or that, if it was a “social construct”, then transitioning should be easier, since there actually is no difference besides our apparent shared hallucination.   If the differences in intelligence and personality are cultural rather than biological, why are adopted children more similar to their biological parents with regard to intelligence? Why do identical twins separated at birth turn out so similar? If the evidence is inconclusive, we should stay at a point of uncertainty, not default on the idea that the differences are cultural because we would prefer that to be the case.  That’s not a bad idea for a test, however, as I’m sure you know, the way genes work is you either inherent one gene or the other. As far as I understand it intelligence is due to various genetic factors; there is no single gene for intelligence. So either way, if mixed race children fall into one category or the other or in-between wouldn’t be completely conclusive."
TiADiscussion,3ad785,boredcentsless,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Let's backtrack a bit. I am not challenging some of the ideas that you think I am challenging. For example, I am fully aware of the role that genetic differences play between individuals, but you are confused if you think that individual differences are relevant to what I am challenging you on. I am challenging your interpretation that we should expect psychological differences between the races. For example, you said:   There seems to have been enough time to develop obvious physical differences though, despite our species being so closely related. I haven’t seen any reason to believe that our brains are somehow immune to genetic mutation and natural selection. Different groups living in such wildly different environments are subject to different evolutionary pressures.   And I tried to correct you in saying that natural selection would tend (on the whole) to make races more similar psychologically (and more different physically) for reasons that Pinker described in the passage I linked to. Again, this is not to say that innate psychological differences could not exist, only that there isn't evidence to support them and that they aren't necessarily expected in the first place.  You also said this:   I don’t understand why people think that differences in skin colour and bone density are adaptive traits, but differences in intelligence aren’t.   In response to this I again tried to explain to you why one might think something like this for scientific reasons.   I fail to see how genetic drift in tandem with natural selection would produce differences smaller than natural selection by itself.   Your assumption that there have been different selection pressures on the psychologies of different racial groups is not based on a good understanding of evolutionary theory and it is probably a false assumption. Genetic drift would be a better candidate to explain genetic psychological differences between the races (because individuals differ in this way) but firstly there isn't any good evidence for that, and secondly genetic drift is an inherently poor candidate for explaining differences between large groups of people.   If the evidence is inconclusive, we should stay at a point of uncertainty, not default on the idea that the differences are cultural because we would prefer that to be the case.   For racial differences in psychology in particular, there is good evidence that cultural factors (norms, beliefs, values) explain much of the differences. Either the correct explanation would turn out to be that culture and biology both play a role (however big or small) or that only culture plays a role. I think you're right that staying uncertain is a good idea, but I think you're wrong to suggest that we should expect that biology plays some role in these differences based on evolutionary theory. That's my entire point really. Your suggestion isn't actually based in a good understanding of evolutionary theory like you think it is."

TiADiscussion,3ad785,bmmbooshoot,9,Sat Jun 20 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right. The institution of racism remains alive and well in the US. Unfortunately, the current state of dialogue on subjects like ""white privilege"" isn't doing much of anything to help this problem. If anything, it's making it worse.   I wrote an explanation on this subject a while back, here it is reposted:  I would say that anyone who uses the phrase “educate yourself” has no interest in advancing the cause of equality. Let me use this comic to illustrate my point.  There’s certainly a lot of data presented that shows that the US is deeply unequal society, and whites enjoy a number of societal advantages over blacks. But who is the audience here, someone naive that isn’t aware of this? You don’t need to convince me, I’m well aware that inequality is a serious issue across many lines: race, gender, sexuality, you name it. The data presented is convincing by itself. Yes, privilege is very much a thing. Yes, racism is alive and well in American institutions, and that is a bad thing. I am—and rightly should be—opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, and similar injustices. Okay then, what can we do about it? This is where the comic falls off the tracks. No explanation for these inequalities is offered other than just “privilege”, full stop. Without a deeper understanding of the forces at work that cause increased college dropout and incarceration among blacks, it’s difficult to come up with a solution.  Implicit in the comic is an absolution from white guilt. Sure, she admits to benefitting from her race and sometimes catches herself being racist once in awhile, but that’s okay, because she speaks the magic words of privilege theory and wrote a comic about it. Therefore, she has done her part to defeat racism. Even if she does still benefit from it and the white supremacy power structure continues unabated. But she’s a good person, see? Individual people being “good” will have no meaningful impact on an unjust power structure. But hey, at least our conscience is soothed.  What especially sticks to me is the comic’s condescending, self-righteous tone, complete with the punchline of “fucking educate yourself”. Really? Has anyone, ever, been persuaded by this type of argument? “Ugh, I can’t believe I have to explain this to you.” How pretentiously juvenile can you get? The writer of this comic and the people who reblog it do so as a means of establishing their social justice street cred. It doesn’t matter what the people outside of your circle do, or if you convinced them to change their minds about white privilege. What’s important is that they get a social reward within their own group. It’s much easier—and more personally rewarding—to swap jokes or outrage than it is engage the rest of the world to try and make a positive change.  I can already hear the replies coming, “Pombologist is a mansplaining, tone-policing racist.” Here’s the other half of the online social justice quandary: criticism of the movement is taken to be a tacit opposition. It is black and white thinking at it’s worst. Do you side with the victims, or do you side with the racists? In the same way that parroting the same lines offers a reward, going against the group carries a hefty risk. Criticism is taken to be an act of betrayal, and the would-be ally for social justice is not merely expunged, but publicly humiliated in the Twitter pillory for indecency. How does this make anything better? How do you achieve social change by ostracizing your allies, or demanding that you never be criticized?  The Internet makes it amazingly easy to filter out the people and things you don’t want to hear. By constantly surrounding yourself with the “right” kind of people, it’s easy to be convinced that not only are you right, but that anyone among the unwashed masses who disagrees with you is wrong, and comically so. Within this bubble, the battle is already won. You’ve painted a pretty enough picture that convinces you that injustice is defeated, save for a few of the willfully ignorant outside the gates. Who needs to be an activist when you can just surround yourself with people who already agree with you?  I really do think that most people are aware that racism exists in America, and are consciously opposed to it. So, what’s the solution? My complaint with this comic is that it details a political problem and offers no solution other than a patronizing demand for the oppressors to “educate themselves”. This is such a bizarre attitude for an activist to take. In fact, it’s pretty much the opposite of activism. Change requires action by its nature. The status quo doesn’t need activists. Herein lies the problem with the current dialogue of privilege theory; it is not used as a way to critically examine how injustice occurs, but rather as a moral bludgeon. A condescending war cry of “check your privilege” may draw attention to the problem, but it will not fix it, nor win any converts.  Changing an unjust structure is not a problem with an easy or obvious solution. But what I can say is that it will not be accomplished without allies. Change is most certainly possible, but doing so will require activists to motivate people outside of their clique to help them, and right now, the online social justice community is failing in that regard spectacularly. There is no actionable plan, only hipster-esque self-congratulation. If you are serious about making the world a more just place and tearing down racism, the patriarchy, or any other unjust institution, then it is, and always will be, your job to educate us."

As far as I can tell, the author of the blog post has severely mangled the data to get to the conclusions he draws.  The first source he cites is an anonymous ""Harvard professor of sociology."" I tracked down the source of the quote, and it isn't from a Harvard professor or even one professor at all. It's from two professors, one at UChicago and one at UM St. Louis publishing in the Harvard Law Review. He appears to have made the extremely amateurish mistake of confusing the journal of publication with the author's institution.  Further, the HLR study does not at all support the conclusions he tries to draw. Here is a direct quote from the abstract:   Race and ethnic disparities in violent offending and victimization are pronounced and long-standing.   What the article does argue is that racism from overt discrimination isn't statistically significant and that the primary source of those ""pronounced and long-standing"" disparities is indirect effects, e.g. a cycle of poverty going back generations.   This blog post has quoted only the first part about there being no direct effects which, out of context, makes it sound like the professors concluded that the justice system doesn't show racial disparities. This would have been clarified if he'd included the very next paragraph of text, which clearly contradicts his claim.  The second source he cites, this time by name, is a 2006 article by Engel and Calnon. This fellow claims that the Engel and Calnon study disproves with popular ""driving while black"" claim that cops pull over whites less often. Let's see how well that interpretation comports with the authors' actual conclusion:   The findings show that young black and Hispanic males are at increased risk for citations, searches, arrests, and uses of force after other extralegal and legal characteristics are controlled. Additional analyses show that minority drivers are not, however, more likely to be carrying contraband than are white drivers.    Answer: Not at all. All the analysis he does afterwards to spin the data as disproving discrimination is not present anywhere in the article, although the way he words it makes it sound like he's still citing Engel and Calnon, when in fact they directly controvert his argument.  Alas, I don't have time to go through every single one of the sources he cites and refute them one by one, but the sheer number and magnitude of the errors revealed in a brief fact check of just the first two suggests this author either is extremely incompetent, has maliciously misrepresented the data, or both.  TL;DR  That author is a total hack who blatantly lies about data. The actual studies cited directly contradict most of what he says."
TiADiscussion,3ad785,sugar_bottom,0,Fri Jun 19 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"What the article does argue is that racism from overt discrimination isn't statistically significant and that the primary source of those ""pronounced and long-standing"" disparities is indirect effects, e.g. a cycle of poverty going back generations.   That is literally what he said:   Sampson and Lauritsen review several studies on police stops of pedestrians. I’ll be coming back to and citing sources from this Sampson and Lauritsen article many times during this discussion as it is one of the most rigorous and trustworthy analyses around – Sampson is Professor of Sociology at Harvard and winner of the Stockholm Prize in Criminology and his review is the most cited one on this topic I could find, so I assume he represents something like a mainstream position. After reviewing a few studies, most notably Smith (1986), they conclude these sorts of police stops demonstrate no direct effect of race – in any given neighborhood, black people and white people are treated equally – but that there is an indirect effect from neighborhood – that is, the police are nastier to everybody in black neighborhoods. Although they don’t say so, the most logical explanation to me would be that black neighborhoods are poorer and therefore higher crime, and so the police are more watchful and/or paranoid.   I think you didn't read the link.  You just assumed he thinks that racial discrimination doesn't exist then attack him for it.  Here is his conclusion:   Summary There seems to be a strong racial bias in capital punishment and a moderate racial bias in sentence length and decision to jail. There is ambiguity over the level of racial bias, depending on whose studies you want to believe and how strictly you define “racial bias”, in police stops, police shootings in certain jurisdictions, and arrests for minor drug offenses. There seems to be little or no racial bias in arrests for serious violent crime, police shootings in most jurisdictions, prosecutions, or convictions. Overall I disagree with the City Journal claim that there is no evidence of racial bias in the justice system. But I also disagree with the people who say things like “Every part of America’s criminal justice is systemically racist by design” or “White people can get away with murder but black people are constantly persecuted for any minor infraction,” or “Every black person has to live in fear of the police all the time in a way no white person can possibly understand”. The actual level of bias is limited and detectable only through statistical aggregation of hundreds or thousands of cases, is only unambiguously present in sentencing, and there only at a level of 10-20%, and that only if you believe the most damning studies. (except that you should probably stay out of Memphis) It would be nice to say that this shows the criminal justice system is not disproportionately harming blacks, but unfortunately it doesn’t come anywhere close to showing anything of the sort. There are still many ways it can indirectly harm blacks without being explicitly racist. Anatole France famously said that “the law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich as well as poor people from begging for bread and sleeping under bridges”, and in the same way that the laws France cites, be they enforced ever so fairly, would still disproportionately target poor people, so other laws can, even when fairly enforced, target black people. The classic example of this is crack cocaine – a predominantly black drug – carrying a higher sentence than other whiter drugs. Even if the police are scrupulously fair in giving the same sentence to black and white cokeheads, the law will still have a disproportionate effect. There are also entire classes of laws that are much easier on rich people than poor people – for example, any you can get out of by having a good lawyer – and entire classes of police work that are harsher on poor neighborhoods than rich neighborhoods. If the average black is poorer than the average white, then these laws would have disproportionate racial effects. For more information on this, I would recommend Tonry and Melewski’s Malign Neglect: Race, Crime, and Punishment in America. They begin by saying everything above is true – the system mostly avoids direct racist bias against black people – and go on to say argue quite consistently that we still have a system where (their words) “recent punishment policies have replaced the urban ghetto, Jim Crow laws, and slavery as a mechanism for maintaining white dominance over blacks in the United States”. If you want something that makes the strongest case for the justice system harming blacks, written by real criminologists who know what they’re talking about, there’s your best bet. (warning: I haven’t read the book. I did read a review article by the same people, which the book is partially based on) Some police officers say the reason they are harsher in poor urban neighborhoods is that the expectation of high levels of unruly behavior necessitates unusually strong countermeasures. For the same reason, I am screening all comments for the next few days. If you post one, expect it to show up eventually or perhaps disappear into the aether.

Let that sink in for a moment: 0.8 more times a month over placebo. (I must admit it is pretty humorous to think of what .08 of a pleasurable sexual experience would look like, if manifested literally.)   I think you're somewhat confused about the meaning of those numbers. Here, from an FDA Briefing Document is a bit of context:   From a median baseline of about 2-3 SSEs per month, flibanserin resulted in a median placebo-corrected increase of about 0.5-1.0 SSEs [Satisfying Sexual Encounters] per month. From a mean baseline of about 1.8-1.9 on the FSFI [Female Sexual Function Index] desire score , flibanserin resulted in a placebo-corrected mean increase of 0.3-0.4 (the FSFI desire score range is 1.2-6.0).

Not to knock your rant, but the 100mg one seems to have shown significant improvement, and it's a 20% improvement.

If you're friend zoned it's best that you come to terms with the fact that there's almost no chance it'll turn into more and move on.  If you're the friend zoner it's scummy to use that to your advantage, let the person know without a shadow of a doubt that there's never going to be anything more and let them go find happiness.  Too often I see the friendzoner take advantage of the person being friend zoned by keeping them on a string and it's sad."

You effectively keep it gender neutral, as well as addressing the potential for both entitlement and manipulation.  Bravo!  Probably the best I've seen it described so far."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,CoMaBlaCK,2,Fri Jun 19 19:56:20 2015 UTC,I know it can go either way so I didn't want to put a gender on either example.  I do know that I was friendzoned HARD once when I was little and it was silly to act the way I did for someone who wasn't ever going to see me that way and I was more at fault then anything about the whole situation for not getting over it sooner.
TiADiscussion,3aan75,strawberrylime13,12,Fri Jun 19 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"My theory on the friend zone (as a female) is thus:     If someone is attracted to you, friendship is not going to stop that.  Despite what I see constantly in television and movies, many couples start off as friends.  Friendship is a great foundation for a relationship to grow from.  You get to know the person with no pressure, you can flirt, hang out, etc, without there being this whole great big pressure of ""dating"".    So, when a girl (or sometimes a guy) says, ""Oh, it would ruin our friendship!""   ...... it's not the friendship, they just aren't into you.  If you had asked them out before becoming friends, they probably would have said no then.  This doesn't mean they'll never like you, I've had times where I told a guy friend I liked him, heard the ""Oh friends blurg"" thing, only to have him ask me out eventually anyway.    In my view, it basically blames someone for not being into another person.  Why is it now the ""friendzoner's"" responsibility to adjust the relationship to suit the needs of the person with the crush?  If the friend harbouring unrequited attractions has been offering things to their crush in hope of getting love back, it's not a horrible thing for the admired person to keep acting as normal.  Nothing has changed for them; this is their friend.  If the person with feelings is uncomfortable, they have every right to stop providing these things or even end the friendship.    This is just my personal experience, and I'm not really a feminist, but I have noticed a trend wherein men act like things with women are a series of token and reward.  As a girl, you notice the ways in which guys behave to gain your attention or favour, and you feel somewhat obliged to reward it somehow.  If the reward is not offered, a confrontation can often occur.  This is not me saying ""omggg men r dangrs n violent"" whatsoever, just that I've had a few experiences where the other person's behaviour left me completely shocked and astounded.    The friendzone, to me, seems like a way of shifting blame or avoiding the pain of ""she's just not that into you.""  It's not your fault, she's just a friendzoner!  Yeah!  Except it's never usually that simple..."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,dermanus,3,Thu Jun 18 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"Real, but there's always at least two sides to every story. Sometimes a person complaining about the friend-zone hasn't been forthright about their interest. Other times the friend-zoner knows about their interest and uses it for their own ends.  And there's infinite shades of grey in between those two options."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,itgscv1,3,Thu Jun 18 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Can you blame people these days? Especially for guys they are told all these things about what not to do. Don't approach girls anywhere, its creepy and they are tired of random strangers trying to pick them up.   You have to be nice, caring, considerate, never pushy, patient, supportive, etc etc. Guys are told, or think from all kinds of media that if he does things for her, shows that he respects her, etc she might come to appreciate him and give him a chance.   A lot of people, but especially guys (since it's almost always guys pursuing) don't know how to go about it directly, and society tells them not to. Just be yourself, you'll find the right one eventually, etc is repeated over and over in media and there's really not a lot of male role models for guys to look up to.  The recent demonization of nice guys really saddens me, if these guys really thought they were entitled to sex they wouldn't be in a friend zone, they would be going after other girls instead of wanting that one special girl they really like. They try to do what they think is right and are attacked and ridiculed, attacked and shamed."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,strawberrylime13,2,Fri Jun 19 00:39:31 2015 UTC,"Women get just as much pressure. Men often have impossible standards, with every guy I've dated I've felt like I've been about to crack to meet their ""standards"".  I've discovered men say they want a certain type of girl, but there's always an ethereal element they're looking for that has been promised in every movie"
TiADiscussion,3aan75,itgscv1,2,Fri Jun 19 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Women just have to be attractive, men don't really care about your job, your education, your career, your intelligence. All you have to do is not be unattractive to the guy. If you are loving, caring, take care of him, and take care of yourself, you are already leagues ahead in what you bring to a long term relationship.  How many times does the average woman get approached asked out/week vs the average guy? The group being pursued has the options, hence they have the standards to be selective. The group pursuing has to meet criterias a, b, c to just qualify for a shot. I think it would be pretty revealing to women if you had to approach guys and face rejection. See what it's like to cold approach a stranger and try striking up a conversation and get a number.   The only guys that might have impossible standards are the celebrities, super rich, or the top few % of guys in terms of looks.   Guys are shamed for objectifying women, we have fat acceptance movements, haes, all different niches of porn to cater to various guys preferences. Yet look at the media, what is the stereotypical male? 6 ft+, six pack, muscles, usually white, handsome. There is very little variation in what women consider attractive vs what guys find attractive. For me as an asian american, a very large percentage of asian women in college refuse to date asian guys.  It's quite common to hear about huge lists women have for their future husband, where in media or online do men talk about a list of standards? In many areas men are giving up on dating altogether because it just isn't worth the effort to them. It could be your social circle, but the majority of guys don't have sky high standards.   Take a look at online dating profiles, girls can easily say they refuse to date guys under x height, guys that don't make $y/yr, any guy with less education need not apply. There was that survey a few years back where women said 80% of guys there were below average. That in no way is rooted in reality.  Men and women were asked, if they had any deal-breakers for going on a second date, what would those be? And men named three.  Women named 300 things that would be deal-breakers for a second date."

If you are a 7, but never had a guy ask for your number/etc, then either you don't get out much, or you are severely overestimating your attractiveness. A 9 will have guys swarming if she goes out. Guys care about looks first and foremost, unless you are 11/10 guys can't believe you can be real, there will be guys approaching.    Eugh, where are these men!?   Hanging out at home or with buddies, playing video games, doing hobbies they like instead of going out looking for girls. Check that askmen thread, a ton of guys have given up because they don't even register on a girl's radar. I personally have some friends with STEM degrees, making 80-120k a year that have given up on dating because they were completely ignored for 5-10 years.  The one common denominator in your dating pool was you, and you say that you choose all of them. That shows not that guys in general might have high standards, but that's the kind of guy you are attracted to. Also since you are the one choosing, you are over looking all the other guys you could have potentially dated.    I genuinely feel that men want a controlling, domineering, somewhat vapid woman.   Your first paragraph doesn't support this at all. If a guy isn't used to hanging out on weekends (very telling) or doesn't want to get picked up at 3am, then they absolutely do not want a dominating so.   As for my end, all I look for in a guy are the following: I am physically attracted, funny, smart, kind, passionate about a thing. That's literally it.   That's still 4 things more than most guys."

I suspect most people who deny its existence are simply very socially obtuse, or much to ideologically driven to care about the truth.  Suggesting that no one would manipulate another persons romantic feelings for them, to gain favours is tantamount to suggesting people would never manipulate other people. It's a stupid persons opinion.  Or much more directly, a defensive persons opinion, because the sad truth of it is a lot of the vehement denials come from people who have done this, or people who it is currently being done to. Long story short, it's dickish to string people along, it's pathetic to seek romance from someone who doesn't find you attractive.

And as the term is never used by women to talk about guys /s , it's considered a form of intimidation of women by SJWs, who are ready to use the UCSB/Isla Vista shootings as evidence that guys talking about being ""friendzoned"" creates an unsafe environment for women, who would, according to them, be pressured to enter relationships with apparently ""nice guys"" or else get killed like those girls at UCSB, or raped."

TiADiscussion,3aan75,uptotwentycharacters,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"That is what its been changed to, however it was/is someone knowingly (normally) taking advantage of the wannabe suitor to get all of the advantages for them but no pay out for the poor bugger getting taken advantage of.  Normally done by women to others (was going to say men, but I can see it being done to a lesbian TBH).  On the other side of the gender scale the closest I can come up with is ""fuckzoned"" ie good enough to bang but not good enough to have in a relationship while dangling the possibility of one for the person being taken advantage of.  Both are scummy behaviors, but its normally the first one thats has anything more than a emotional toll."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,lessthan3yorkies,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:05:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's a problematic concept because of how it's used. It basically just means unrequited love but I've often heard it used to say that others are in the wrong for not finding them attractive. People who use the term ""friendzone"", in my experience are often those who feel they are somehow entitled to a romantic relationship. It also seems to be coupled to the toxic idea that romance and friendship are mutually exclusive, that romantic love cannot develop from a friendship. The obvious problem with this is that it causes people to seek relationships exclusively with strangers, and they often try to push for a serious relationship before they get to know each other."

TiADiscussion,3aan75,OPPRESSIVE_SHITLORD,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:20:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's a term that's changed meaning recently. I'm fairly certain that it used to mean a sort of perennial ""back-burner status"" where the target of the affection would fail to turn a suitor's advances down clearly (not necessarily intentionally -- it could be caused by poor communication on both or either's side), leaving the suitor ""dangling"" with an emotional charge that's neither allowed to go anywhere nor allowed to be properly grounded or redirected.  In recent years, though, it seems the ""friend zone"" merely means having been turned down with a ""I just want to be friends"" line.  Now, the old sense of the term does exist, but is pretty rare after the mid-teens. Most people learn to communicate well enough to avoid it, and the intentional friendzoners are rare. With the latter term, though, no, that doesn't exist. That's just being turned down."
TiADiscussion,3aan75,Wylanderuk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"It's real. I think there are some people who do it on purpose, some people who do it accidentally, and some people who do it because they think they are being nice and don't want to break someone's heart. I think it happens in men and women, but I think it affects men more due to the nature of the courtship process, hormones, and the drive of testosterone that so much influences the male experience.   I do think it easily crosses over into the insufferable ""nice guy"" zone where dudes think that worshiping and fawning over and giving presents to women entitles them to sex, like if they just hang around and white-knight them then they will receive a reward. I think the majority of these people would go away if they were taught about actual seduction and conversation skills and how to improve their own lives before trying to drag someone else into them.   I think a lot of these guys look for love/relationships as a medication for their own sadness, which explains the desperation and hamhandedness of their techniques a lot of the time. I talked to a guy like this the other day and had to explain that a relationship is a reward, not a prescription. If you make yourself into a desirable person - and there are many ways to do this - you will find people begin to desire you. Friendzoning, from what I've seen, happens due to proximity. The dude latches onto the first bit of female attention they get and they are trying to figure out how to reconcile it with the hormones and testosterone and all that other shit listed above."

It's easy to feel like you've 'debunked' something when you've used terrible statistics or whatever yourself, even if your side of the issue is the correct one in the end.  So a sub like that would need to have a culture of friendly 'debunking debunking', where someone can politely say 'actually, your debunking relies on some shaky stats or a not very good study', and that person is treated as having done a good thing, instead of being berated for breaking the jerk.  Of course, you can go too far and poke holes in any study (it turns out most science is imperfect in some way), so people would have to be careful not to devolve into disbelieving literally any study either.  It's a fine line between trusting everything you read in science and dismissing it all, and the grey area in the middle is fraught with the potential to selectively trust things that supported your ideals anyway.  So you have to be very careful not to fall into the trap of making selective demands for rigor."

I also think there's a great deal of pandering going on in the mainstream media to appease that demographic. It's gotta be so easy. And there's still the distinction between identity politics and economic policies. But honestly, I can totally see people identifying as whatever race they want going mainstream in 20 years.   I'm half white and something else, and while I don't really identify as anything besides myself, I could probably claim either and nobody would press me about it, or call ""cultural appropriation"" on me.    But what happens when someone is a mix of all races? If they're equal parts white, black, asian and indian for example, can they just pick whichever one they feel like? Who decides the authenticity then?  I honestly think this whole situation is a symptom of the concept of racial identity collapsing on itself. I don't think people are going to homogenize quite like this projection, but if they did, who is to say what race they are? What percentage black would Rachel Dolezal have to be to claim ""blackness""? I think it's clear that institutional/systemic racism has proven itself more of a threat than personal/individual racism, but if that is out of the equation, race wouldn't even be a relevant attribute besides superficially.  It seems most criticisms of her (besides lying about it all) stem from claiming blackness while still benefiting from ""white privilege"", but that suggests that the real measurement of a person's ethnicity is through oppression in relation to other races, while genetics are the only actual scientific signifier of racial phenotypes.

The nonstop ""diversity"" and ""mulitculturalism"" mantras at most universities are kind of a PC holdover. There's not much wrong with those ideas properly understood and in moderation of course, but thats a different story. The point is that angry PC nuttiness lives on in watered-down form...but still with the mindless cultishness...  In some cases, the most radical and laughable PC ideas reemerged among the SJWs and are now mainstream...one thing that turned moderates against PC was the then-laughable Antioch College policy that guys had to ask for explicit permission before advancing to each level during sex...""can I kiss you?"", ""can I touch your boob?""

Excessive staring can used as part of a case for workplace sexual harassment.  It can be considered a form of harassment in schools, and many gyms have a no gawking policy on top of a no phone policy.  However, ""Stare Rape"" will never be codified into law or taken seriously as a term.  Respect for minority cultures is an important issue, and is the issue concerning things like the Washington Redskins controversy.

The most important part of ""fat acceptance"" is self-acceptance.  But this modern version of body acceptance takes the easy way out and projects people's self-esteem problems on others, which I think is a terrible mistake and only makes the problem worse.   Another aspect of this (and the whole post-modernist SJW mentality in general ) is that people aren't being taught one of the most important things in life: nobody gives a fuck about you, and you are not entitled to having people appreciate you just because you're a human being. When you realize and internalize that, it's something that frees you and allows you to live as yourself and do the things you want.  Sorry for going off-topic, but to me all of this is related. When you don't ""solidify your own self"", you start seeing oppression everywhere, and that's what generates concepts like the ""Male Gaze"" (which has become indistinguishable from ""sexual interest"")."
TiADiscussion,3a1juv,kyapu_chinchin,7,Tue Jun 16 17:06:08 2015 UTC,"The most important part of ""fat acceptance"" is self-acceptance.   This really is it. You can demand other people love you all you like. Until you love yourself you won't be happy. There will always be people in life you want to belittle or judge you for their own reasons. That's their problem, not yours.  For a lot of the rhetoric it's obvious they care a lot about what other people think of them without realizing no one thinks about them at all."
TiADiscussion,3a1juv,dermanus,3,Tue Jun 16 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize for going off topic, as it does all feed into the same conversation.    The most important part of ""fat acceptance"" is self-acceptance.   This is certainly the intention and a worthy message. Unfortunately for some people, self-acceptance isn't enough -- which ties back to my point. It doesn't matter if you accept yourself, everyone else has to accept you too, and find you attractive. For men this is somewhat easier, because we (in an effort to get laid) have prioritized other character traits that others can find attractive: humor, intelligence, creativity, ambition. Women are trained to value their looks above all else. I guess what is so frustrating is that this is what they should be fighting against -- the expectation to not rely on others to protect them, be it a man or culture at large."

It's widely suspected that this is due to two reasons:  A. She was a pornstar and that is a career path that goes counter to everything the typical Tumblr feminist believes in.  B.

You can't just look at one factor that supports your agenda and deem the argument settled.  For fucks sake, I don't know whether it is scope insensitivity or just the empathy gap at work here, but the comment that WOMAN made (I love how you infantilise her as a way of reducing her responsibility, par for the course when it comes to gender relationship---female hypoagency strikes again) is monstrous.

By getting all riled up by her statement, you show exactly the reaction they want to provoke.  Also it's quite safe to assume that this woman was never intending to actually kill someone. That doesn't make the statement ok, it just puts it into perspective.  Now, with Hunt we have to assume that he sees female scientists differently than male scientists. Actually, we don't have to assume that, we know it, because he said so (and he meant it, as he told the BBC). And, unfortunately, we also have to assume that this state of mind influenced his actions in the past, namely that he treated his female PhD students and post-docs differently.  You're comparing apples to oranges here, and if you really think it's always only the message that counts, and never the messenger, I'm sorry."

If you're making offensive statements publicly in work hours then I would say your employer absolutely has the right to sack you for that.  Besides, as a female scientist I would be wary of working under someone who'd expressed views like that. Nowadays I would just roll my eyes and choose someone else as a supervisor, but as a prospective undergraduate already feeling terrified at the thought of leaving home and the rest of it I rejected universities for less. You could argue that that's on me, but unfortunately the institution's still the one that loses out financially if prospective students are being put off – which doesn't make it right for them to sack him, but I can understand why they felt the need to.

I don't necessarily think that'd be wrong mind you, but what I mean is that it applies universally, to all points of view.  Then again let's not forget the larger context: it was a joke.

Your entire point is built upon a ridiculous characterization rarely found outside the fempire. I don't have to answer it in a manner that placates your Philosophy 101 requirement because your only point is bullshit. How do you refute the claim ""feminist all want to jack alpha male sperm?"" You don't, because it's a stupid, shallow point that does nothing but reflect how reinforced my own viewpoint is. I assume you also subscribe to the belief that conservatives are pro-life because they like keeping women in their place. Just like it would be stupid for me to say that all progressives dream of a classless, borderless world devoid of private property where each contributes according to his ability, it sounds ridiculous for you to make the inverse statement. That's why I called it a strawman: it is. It's a caricature devoid of any basis except for your own biases.    Reactionaries have 100% of the time been negative in my experience.    And your experience alone is where everything you're saying is coming from. So you should probably stop acting like it's an iron universal truth.   In theory, want to return to an old status quo is not negative or positive. In the context of western society, being reactionary is negative.   It's only negative because you disagree with what you think it is, and considering almost everyone holds some views that are reactionary and some that are progressive, you probably don't really know what it is. Which brings us to your initial post   TiA is still predominantly a very moderate and reasonable group, we just have to work to keep the fringes on the fringe.   Let's be honest for just a second here, by moderate, you mean people who think pretty much just like you. Because you can be moderate, and I can be moderate, and we can still not agree on much, and that doesn't make one of not a moderate.  This is TiADiscussion, not TiAcirclejerk.

Or something like a domestic violence support group, where the 'safe space' part in theory means that victims can discuss the issues they might experience, without fear of being mocked or without your abuser being there, two things which would probably make people very much afraid to get the help they need. The problem is that there's usually additional segregations on those so certain groups that aren't the majority in that arbitrary segregation often can't even find a space entirely.  Basically a completely reasonable thing, if you don't artificially add restrictions on who is allowed into the 'safe space' and what counts as violating the 'safe space', and basically aren't a dick about it.

TiADiscussion,39qxx2,Toxic_Seahorse,7,Sat Jun 13 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"Depends how you actually define microaggression. Along with other SJW terms nobody can actually tell what it really means, because it just tends to mean what someone wants it to mean at the particular moment in order to suit their own agenda.   From what I can gather though (just from Wikipedia, I refuse to view that Buzzfeed article) it's an unintentional action or saying that reflects the views that are ingrained in society, or some shit like that. So ""all men are rapists"" wouldn't count because the people that say that are very much conscious of what they are saying, as opposed to if it was like someone said ""oh well he was male so he must have been a rapist"" in casual conversation without thinking."

TiADiscussion,39qxx2,Anonymous_Ascendent,10,Sun Jun 14 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"No, because there is no such thing as a microaggression. Microagressions, much like cultural appropriation, do not actually exist. Rather, it was a concept manufactured by would-be social justice heroes so they would have something else to be offended about.   The very definition of aggression includes purposeful, deliberate action. Microaggressions, however, are unintentional. Anything unintentional cannot, by definition, be aggression. You can act like an asshole. You can say something culturally ignorant and offensive. But you cannot commit a microaggression. It's an absurd and oxymoronic concept."

There's nothing contradictory in describing something as ""aggression on a smaller than average scale"".

TiADiscussion,39qxx2,EggplantWizard5000,-3,Sun Jun 14 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"Hostile can be defined as unfriendly. An unfriendly attitude/behavior towards another on a smaller scale than average? That's completely compatible with the concept of a microaggression.     Yes, everyone makes unintentional insults and slights. However, not everyone receives them at the same rate or about the same topic. There's a difference between someone accidentally insulting your cooking once and minorities consistently hearing unintentionally racist/homophobic/etc comments from people who don't realize what they're doing. And it's not a special snowflake bullshit word, it's useful for describing a specific experience/concept that is otherwise lengthier to define. Is ""racism"" a special snowflake bullshit word for ""discrimination/hatred on the grounds of race""?"
TiADiscussion,39qxx2,lifeonthegrid,2,Sun Jun 14 03:29:27 2015 UTC,the mistake you're making is thinking you can reason with people who get offended by the word ''aggression'' using logic.
TiADiscussion,39qxx2,owl_party,6,Sun Jun 14 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"This is one of the many cases in which the SJWs build confusion into their very terminology. Literally and compositionally, a ""micro aggression"" would be a minor act of aggression. But thats not the way the term is used. It's actually used to describe minor annoyances, innocent mistakes, etc.  As is typical of SJWs, they use this term to sneakily and melodramatically upgrade a small irritant into ZOMG AGGRESSION. So though the concept can make sense, it doesn't given how it is actually used. It's like the term 'rape culture'...its plain meaning is not consistent with its actual jargonistic use. Presumably a ""rape culture"" would be a culture in which rape was typically condoned or promoted. But the term is actually used to describe e.g. the U.S., of which that is obviously not true."
TiADiscussion,39qxx2,MosDaf,0,Wed Jun 17 14:18:24 2015 UTC,Clearly it's a conspiracy built to confuse and trick people into believing it and not simply a term that whose components aren't as accurate as you would like it.

Time after time they've demonstrated a perfect willingness to plug their ears and la la la la their way through any external criticism - they build their platform around wage gap and rape statistics that were debunked years ago by people who have nothing to do with either SJW or anti-SJW.   Their currency is entirely guilt and appeal to emotion - that's how they win PR battles. That's how they get big companies to bow to their will. That's why it's taken so long for people to start calling them out on their BS. If you disagree, you're a bigot. If you disagree on any women's issue in the entire world, you're a sexist. If you disagree on any racial issue in the entire world, you're a racist. If you disagree on any issue regarding various cultures, you're an imperialist.  So no, it's not at all hard to believe that they would describe a small transgression that literally everyone commits from time to time with such a gnarly label as ""microaggression"" so that they could apply it selectively against people who are guilty of wrongthink."
TiADiscussion,39qxx2,Jkwoftw,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I really wish people would not downvote based on simple disagreement. I don't think you're right, but I'd like to think this is a place where (unlike SJWs) we can civilly disagree and discuss this stuff.   Yeah, hostile is being unfriendly. The thing is, no matter what definition you use, aggression is overt. It's inherent within the very concept. Microaggression is not -- it's taking out the aggression part of aggression. So I stand by my point that any word that means unintentionally aggressive is an oxymoron.   I think you have a point that minorities have to put up with a lot of unintentional shit that whites and straight people don't. I concede that. And it does rise above the level of insulting a person's cooking. However, I don't think we should invent terms that make no logical sense to describe them. ""Insensitivity,"" for example, is a better description of what is happening. The only disadvantage is that it doesn't semantically maximize the victimhood of the target in the way that ""microaggression"" does."

Firstly some people do believe that racism means ""white people being prejudice towards black people"" because that is the primary kind of racism we hear about. That definition fails anyway because it doesn't account for groups of poc's being prejudiced towards other poc's. This is also the root of the ""reverse racism"" thing, because under this racism is one way street.  Secondly, what you witness with most ""Sjw"" types (a term I'm not comfortable with entirely) is the confusion of 'Institutional Racism' and 'racism' Often in academia, 'racism' is used as short hand for 'Institutional Racism'. This is a problem because they're different. ""Racism"" is prejudice based on race. It's personal, individuals are racist. ""Institutional Racism"" is racism perpetuated by the mechanisms of power. By bureaucracy and government ect.   In the west today, the institutions of power do not discriminate against white people. This is where ""racism against white people doesn't exist"" comes from. However, it's reached the point that people have stopped even thinking about the difference.  People also often think that if you say ""it's possible to be racist to white people"" what you mean is ""White people are regularly discriminated against"". Which isn't true."

That is what it has always been. The short version is that it promotes empathy on an individual level by trying to sidestep prejudice.  For example, you aren't a gay black girl in a wheelchair, you are Samantha. Who you are may be totally influenced by all of that, but you might not be influenced by it at all. The only way to figure it out is to go in cold and get to know the person. But what you don't want to do is start looking at her as disabled and someone who is probably sad all the time, or she is angry because she is black.   It promotes tribalism. Like, you are gay so you need to have these key opinions and tow the company line. You're Indian, so you need to have these beliefs, and this person is black so they need to fall in line with these narratives. It happens on all sides, I've seen way too many Black and Asian kids excommunicated from their race for some shit that didn't click with the group.   The people saying it's ""white privilege"" are the same types who say everything is white privilege. Every bad thing is going to lead back to that Moriarty. It's proposed by people who really, really, really want an identity. They don't have an identity of their own because they are young and stupid, so they want to hard-code all this other shit into race and sexuality. Rather than break down boundaries between people, they want to create boundaries and they want their zone to be cool and angry and be able to say whatever they want. You think your black friends experienced ""microaggressions?"" Maybe they did. But then again, maybe they didn't. Maybe they've had all sorts of boons heaped onto them due to white guilt. You never really know by looking at someone, so tossing away those prejudices just saves time and energy.   Every argument I have heard to the contrary simply promotes prejudice, but a prejudice that they are comfortable with."

You could perhaps draw a distinction between race and nationality there in the same way that people draw a distinction between sex and gender.

TiADiscussion,39o4e7,NewOrleansAints,10,Sat Jun 13 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"First, if it's a ""gender is a social construct therefore""-argument then that's clearly circular and we should throw that one straight out.  There are biological elements associated with gender as there are with race, and the two both have social elements as well. There is no definitive building of race or gender purely on biology or experience.  I think the way to distinguish what's going on here is to establish a racial equivalent of sex, as sex relates to gender. I think this is actually what you are getting at with regard to the Japan example. In other words you might have a biological race and a cultural identity. In your Japanese example your cultural identity would almost certainly be Japanese.   If we divide it up like that: sex-gender race-culture, then I think it becomes clear that we actually already operate like this in the world to quite some extent.    But to make something clear, the above was NOT what she did.  She did not claim to have lived however long embedded in black communities and have become part of minority culture (which she almost certainly has done). What she claimed was that she was African American. She did not say, ""I am biologically male but identity as female"" or ""I am biologically Caucasian but culturally black"". She said ""I'm black"".   To be clear too, and to make a more appropriate comparison, a man presenting to a psychiatrist saying ""I am biologically female"", would not be treated as a transgender person. That would be delusion, not dysphoria. Again, I have a couple of other videos where I talk about the nuance of how we define mental illness here and here."

White American, itself an official U.S. racial category, refers to people ""having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa"" who reside in the United States.   Based on the definitions created by the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Census Bureau, the concepts of race and ethnicity are mutually independent, and respondents to the census and other Census Bureau surveys are asked to answer both questions. Hispanicity is independent and thus not the same as race, and constitutes an ethnicity category, as opposed to a racial category, the only one of which that is officially collated by the U.S. Census Bureau. For the Census Bureau, Ethnicity distinguishes between those who report ancestral origins in Spain or Hispanic America (Hispanic and Latino Americans), and those who do not (Non-Hispanic Americans).   The U.S. Census Bureau asks each resident to report the ""race or races with which they most closely identify.""

Things are even worse with sex and gender. And worst of all, most people say ""x is socially constructed"" without any clear meaning in mind at all. If you look through almost any discussion using the term, you'll see massive, debilitating equivocation.      However...yeah, if anything the intellectual left has recently been pushing the line that race is a ""social construct"" even harder than the claim that gender is. What do they mean by that?  Well, pick whatever you like from the various interpretations above...or from five or ten others. Fact is, they don't mean anything determinate at all...or they switch from one meaning to another depending on what's rhetorically convenient. There are, of course, real biological racial differences. Though sometimes they are exaggerated. There are also fictional racial differences...ie ones people made up, ones that aren't real. But race is certainly not entirely a social creation or social institution. However, racial differences tend to be relatively superficial. They aren't terribly significant biologically. Sex, by way of comparison, is a very significant biological difference. So...yeah, you're right, really.  If you're going to call one of those things a social creation or socially-sustained fiction or WTF ever they happen to mean by ""socially constructed"" this time....then yeah, race is more like that than sex is.  So it should be easier to make the case that Dolezal is black than that Jenner is a woman.     However, of course, the SJWs are committed to conclusions that don't seem consistent-- Jenner is a woman but Dolezal is not black. (Oddly, TiA agrees...) It's very difficult to maintain both of those conclusions. Since race is less firmly grounded in biology than sex, it should be easier to change one's race by doing things like changing one's appearance, living as the other race, etc.).     Some people try to reconcile these positions by gesturing at alleged brain differences in trans people, or by arguing that Dolezal isn't sincere, but is lying for personal gain. Neither gambit works, however. Fist, the brain difference claim probably won't stand the test of time. fMRI studies are often impressionistic and badly done, especially when political motives are afoot. Even if these hypotheses do stand the test of time, we have no evidence that Jenner has the brain difference. Further, no one seriously seems to be arguing that Jenner should not be accepted if it turns out that Jenner does not have the relevant brain abnormality. In short, the (probably fictional) brain differences are a red herring.  As for the other point, it simply isn't true that Dolezal is crooked or insincere. She's wrong...she simply isn't black...but she seems sincere. She really does seem to have a bunch of nutty beliefs, and really does seem to think that, in some weird sense, she's black.  Finally, for all we know, there might also be brain differences among ""transracial"" individuals...     It's almost always possible to gerrymander some rhetorical fancy footwork to assuage the pangs of cognitive dissonance, though....  If you are more interested in maintaining the conclusions you prefer than in understanding the facts, you can almost always cook up some way to convince yourself that you don't have to think, and don't have to change your mind..."

They talk about gender and race as social constructs when giving the rest of us bigots a ""history lesson"" on racism and sexism and how they were artificially created to oppress women and minorities, but they seem perfectly content with perpetuating those constructs if it means special treatment for those formerly marginalized groups, or accusing us of ""colorblind racism"" if we dare say that race doesn't really mean anything, because they say it ""erases the experiences that minorities had to face"", and make the dubious assertion that minorities cannot afford to see the world in a colorblind manner."

TiADiscussion,39o4e7,lifeonthegrid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of little nitty-gritty aspects that can play into how race is determined and a lot of it is very nuance. Sometimes race is classified by the shape of the skull, sometimes the amount of melanin in someone's skin, sometimes it's the One-Drop rule (depending on the region) but nationality doesn't play into it. You could be white but born in Nigeria and it won't make you black. You could be black but born in Norway and it won't make you white.   And there's always the issue of mixed race people, too.   I remember there were these two fraternal twins in my 6th grade class who were half black and half white but the sister looked more white (pale skin, blue eyes, blonde hair) while her brother looked more black (dark skin, brown eyes, dark brown hair) but does the fact that the sister is white-passing make her any less black than her brother?  Anyway, in regards to comparing race to gender, that's apples and oranges, really. There is a neurological aspect that plays into being transgender because I guess it's been shown than men's brains work a bit differently than women's brains which may be where our society constructs its ideas of gender in the first place. But there have been no studies (at least none that my ignorant self is aware of) that show that there's a difference between a black brain and a white brain.   TL;DR: Race and gender are both social constructs but race is more based off of a mix of culture along with other small physical characteristics and the way a society chooses to classify those things all depends. The way society constructs gender is more based off of neurological aspects that are common according to sex which are then reinforced as gender roles.  I hope my rambling made at least some sense. I apologise."

You can't legitimately say you're part of a race unless you have some combination of culture, ancestry, and appearance such that are in general associated with it. Your white-Japanese example certainly has Japanese culture, so there's some legitimacy to a claim of being Japanese.  Meanwhile, the differences in the brains, biochemistry, and behavior of a man and woman account for much of the socially constructed gender difference. Behavior, hormones, and appearance can be changed to match the ""brain gender,"" so there's an actual way to be transgender without it being a charade.   A lot of the furor over Dolezal is about just that -- the sense of it being a charade. When you say you're African-American, you are in essence saying you have some black ethnicity and live in America. When that turns out not to be true, it makes us wonder why she put so much effort into seeming black and how it benefited her in the short run.  The timing of this right after an enormous media sensation on transgender is leading some people to make comparisons without really thinking about why they may not be valid comparisons."

See American racial divide vs European.  Sex, biological sex, is not a social construct.  Transgender people actually have the 'wrong sex' for their brain or the 'wrong gender' for their body (the name is the result of decades of politics.  Literally, it is best understoon as  one whis gender is across from their sex, or as using the common gender (where it is the same as sex)) It's a brains thing.  As far as I know, there isn't a brain difference between races that would cause transracial people to exist."

She said she is still focused on the threats she received in the mail.  A police report filed in March questions how hate mail ended up in the PO Box for the Spokane chapter of the NAACP. On Wednesday, the Spokane Police Department released an eleven page report into their findings thus far.  In March, Spokane NAACP President Rachel Dolezal claimed she found an envelope with pictures of lynchings and references to local cases concerning race.  However, investigators later noticed important marks missing from the package.  It was delivered to a post office box. But it did not have a date stamp or barcode according to an on-going police report by SPD.  Staff said the only other way for a unprocessed letter to land in a PO Box would be if it were placed there by someone with a key or a USPS employee was involved.

In other words, since there's no reason to believe that the gendering mechanisms within the human brain operate perfectly all the time (since nothing else about the human body does either), and the existence of biological variants on gender is well-confirmed, it's likely that gender variation has been a thing ever since there were humans.  However, the developmental system of a human couldn't produce a fox brain without a catastrophic failure that would kill the host.  Likewise, there's nothing to indicate that differences in brains between races are anything near close to magnitude of sexual dimorphism, and it would be very strange if there were.  There's no fake outrage, just a touch of the classic ""someone is wrong on the internet"" feeling.  Edit: Nothing about being brave, either.

You know that dressing as a different sex and race isn't illegal, it's just rude and weird.  And it would still be really weird if a black woman used Hollywood makeup to dress as a white man.  It's kind of like faking a disability, which is disrespectful to people that actually have that disability.  (Only there it's worse, because we, rightfully, make special accomodations for the disabled, and that costs resources.)  People have to live with the random social bullshit other people put them up to because of their race.  That's not just made-up SJW bullshit, racism still exists in this world.  Someone that is disguised can just slip off the disguise and lose the heat, just like someone pretending to be blind can just stop pretending to be blind.  But a black man is a black man 24/7.  For a somewhat analogous situation, people respect members of the military in the US precisely because of the stuff US soldiers have to put up with.  They don't want to give that same respect to others who don't.  This is despite the fact that not all soldiers have to put up with the same level of bullshit, and not all <insert race here> do either.  Some people complain about treating transgenders as their target sex, saying something along the lines of ""they say they're women, but they're really men!""  The thing is, neurologically, that's not really accurate.  They're not lying about it for whatever reason.  And treating transgenders as their target sex is important for their mental health outcomes.  Once we hit the early Transhuman era and anyone can race-flip all they want, go ahead and knock yourself out.  At that point, race and gender will be rendered largely meaningless."

Unfortunately, there is a lot of precrdent to allow school to make their own disciplinary standards, which is why you see a lot of the cases against schools in either civil suits or reverse-title IX suits.Schools are very afraid of being labeled apathetic to sexual assault, and have been using Title IX essentially as cover to something they've wanted to do for a while: avoid bad press and civil suits. What nobody expected (surprise surprise) was that the moral panic about campus rape is just that: a panic, based on unreliable statistics.

Unless we were to become like SJWs ourselves and believe every accusation of domestic violence or rape, I see no problem with playing her.  Those SJWs would pounce on her in a heartbeat if she were a man, even without evidence, but it is the right call, given that US Soccer is sane and trusts evidence (or the lack thereof) over the word of an accuser, to not suspend her for the WWC.

TiADiscussion,39jk7u,Raudskeggr,46,Fri Jun 12 07:51:23 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: We haven't changed. The so-called social justice warriors have.  I disagree. I think the outrage reflects more on how the insanity from the radicals has changed, rather than how we here have changed. The extremists have become bolder. The crazy is more blatant, more in your face than ever. Tumblr moved from people claiming to be cats trapped in human bodies to ""ironically"" espousing hatred and genocide.  At the risk of dating myself, I became an adult when what would become the Internet was still relegated to research labs. The kind of dross you see highlighted here was relegated to pamphlets, generally unpopular books, and small groups of quiet lunatics. The only conversations about killing all men or ending capitalism took place in smoke filled rooms with bad electronic music playing softly in the background.  The rise of the internet bloggers changed that. Most of the social justice hives like Salon, Slate, Huffington Post, Jezebel, et. al. began as blogs. Tumblr is a micro-blogging site. Twitter is a collection of nano-blogs. The loons monetized virtual victim-hood, and some of them have become comfortable enough to tell the world what they really think. And what they really think is sometimes horrifying.  [TW] This is where it gets a lot more serious, complete with a nasty history lesson. Continue at your own risk.  At the turn of the last century, the new American science of eugenics was spreading through US college campuses like a wildfire. In 1915, so-called ""progressives"" and ""feminists"" were either debating their favored solution to the dysgenic crisis (yeah, it was the gas chamber) or wringing their hands over how the Bill Of Rights stymied the progress of their movement.  Non-profits were formed. Books were published. Propaganda rags called for immediate action. Charities donated money to the cause, including quite a bit to this one particular fellow... Laws were passed. Inalienable rights were suspended. Many were forcibly sterilized. Some were killed.  In 2015, so-called ""progressives"" and ""feminists"" have dusted off last century's rhetoric. They jokingly call for genocide. They ironically spew hatred. And no, I am not suggesting that the social justice warriors are going to be putting on brown shirts and sending people to camps. I'm not stupid. But I am bothered that they now dare say that shit out loud. That is a huge change.  But, they are absolutely serious about stripping away the rights of their ideological opponents. There have been many entries on TiA about ""no platform"", the banning of ""hate speech"", the desire to criminalize criticism of feminism, the contempt for due process of law, and much more.  Eugenics was discredited, and its champions slunk away to hide under rocks and white-wash their past. But a lot of damage was done before then. I take things more seriously now because the ""social justice"" movement has started doing some serious harm.   We can laugh at a lot - perhaps most - of the shit here, but some of it just isn't funny any more. It's not us. It's them."

Sometimes you need some reassurance that you're not the crazy one, or at least that you can have a civil conversation about it without much risk of being screamed at and called horrible things. When it comes to laughing at people I don't get that much out of it, and for that reason I'm not really that into the posts that are about otherkin or other cases where people are just kind of doing their own thing and not really bothering or hurting others.  I actually started out at r/KotakuInAction for similar reasons (if a more specific reaction to how those issues w/the gaming media resulted in people getting blamed and levied with terrible accusations w/o any real evidence), but my concerns are more with SJWs in general and less with the gaming media in specifically or ""ethics in game journalism."" That, and I felt less and less like I aligned with a lot of the culture, opinions, and methodologies there either (and have some similar feelings about it that you expressed about TiA), so after a while of staying off I hopped over to here.

TiADiscussion,39nktw,pikkamakk,4,Sat Jun 13 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think the issue here is you don't understand the actual phrase ""cultural appropriation"", which is okay, many SJWs don't either.  Exchanging of ideas, fashions, etc, isn't seen as a big deal, as you said, happens all the time.  The actual ""appropriation"" part, is when actual ""cultural and traditional"" things are taken, for the person's own use, often against the wishes of the original owner. The big (and probably most legitimate) fuss in the states right now is the Native headdress.  This is an item of religious significance, and you see hordes of Paris Hilton wanna be's wearing them to all the big music festivals, as a fashion accessory.  Many of the tribes have asked for this stop, as an act of religious respect.  So naturally, in the state of Oklahoma the governor's daughter makes it a point to wear one when her band performs.  A similar thing, that didn't get a lot of attention due to the time period, was the Catholic rosary.  I saw a number of people wearing them to nightclubs after Boondock Saints hit the mainstream.  Again, this is an actual item with religious purpose, and some morons are wearing them as flashy jewelry.  The disconnect occurs when people on social media conflate fashion, or entertainment, with ""culture"".    EDIT:  I should probably point out, this is a thing that can't necessarily be stopped either, especially since people will always push the line further out.  I'm waiting for the day I'm not allowed to wear an Ed Hardy shirt, since I'm not white."

Basically it goes along the lines of:  Wearing a Utilikilt is not cultural appropriation, it's a man skirt with pockets.  Wearing a specific tartan, that holds some significance, but you just think the Irish are cool (or the ever popular ""my family is from Ireland""), may not be religious appropriation.  Last I checked the Irish were divided between Catholic and Protestant, and the kilt comes from the Celtic and Gaelic cultures, who had different gods.  Also, the Irish wore solid colored kilts, tartans are Scottish and Welsh.  I know that answer is a bit oddball, but I've actually met ""that guy"" with the kilt.  A few times actually.  Dia de los Muertos is really only a Mexican thing, sprouted from the indigenous traditions mixed with Catholicism, so calling it religious appropriation would confuse the hell out of people in Boston.  It's not to say you can't take ideas from other people, and even do it in a respectful way.  All Soul's Day instead of Day of the Dead.  Kirituhi instead of Moko.

It's how Miley Cyrus becomes the face of twerking in America and how Iggy Azaela gets nominated for a Grammy. The people behind the cultural creations don't get famous, don't get paid, and don't even get credited.

It shows how dedicated/delusional Stannis is to his cause, it shows that there is nothing Melissandre won't do to serve her god (big difference between putting leeches on a twenty something and buring a small girl alive, it's Shireen's tragic downfall as her desire to be loved and willingness to do anything for her father backfires. It makes sense from a story perspective.   I can't say this about the Sansa scene. What did it accomplish? We already know Ramsay is awful, he had Theon tortured, raped, castrated and broken. Knowing that he's a rapist doesn't inform his character or his motivations. As for Sansa, It's not like we haven't seen her victimized enough. She's not a character that was in need of another obstacle.

TiADiscussion,39horb,pleasure2kill,15,Thu Jun 11 20:00:04 2015 UTC,"Privilege is a lot more complicated than Tumblr seems to think. The basic idea of ""checking your privilege"" is basically about trying to understand the other person's experiences and recognize that they may have faced certain challenge that you did not. But privilege can't be thought of simply as a quantity, since certain traits can give you an advantage in some areas and a disadvantage in others. I also think it is useful to distinguish between ""natural"" privilege which just arises on its own in culture (like men being more likely to be taken seriously on certain topics, and on the flip side women being more likely to receive a light punishment for many crimes) and ""artificial"" privilege which is basically what affirmative action programs are, ""artificial"" doesn't mean the privilege isn't real but that it was created by conscious intention, usually in an attempt to cancel out the natural privilege that exists. A black person who lived in a region with lots of racist whites would still be privileged from affirmative action since it's a legal requirement, however in ordinary social interaction they would be disprivileged due to their race and the attitudes of those around them. Whether they are privileged or disprivileged overall is not easy to define."
TiADiscussion,39horb,uptotwentycharacters,5,Thu Jun 11 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"That's kind of my point though - there are a ton of examples where one person has a certain privilege in a certain situation, and that changes depending on the person and the situation.

And in some cases it can be said that one group is obviously privileged (though this is less true today, at least in the first world, than it was in the past). But viewing privilege as a binary (having privilege or not having it) or even as a one-dimensional spectrum (some groups have more privilege than others) really isn't accurate, it's a bit more complex since some groups may be privileged in one way but disprivileged in other ways. There certainly isn't open, systematic oppression in modern America like there was against black people in the 1840s American South or Jews in Nazi Germany. The error made by SJWs is that when they learn that one group is privileged they try to fit it into some kind of black-and-white, oppressor-versus-oppressed framework, which isn't really an accurate representation of privilege in modern society."

It is sometimes an introduction to, or stepping stone to, consensus decision-making in which simple majorities have less power.  The theory behind the progressive stack is to counteract the experience that people who are part of the majority or dominant culture are generally encouraged to express themselves, while people from minority or non-dominant groups are mostly silenced or ignored. In practice, ""majority culture"" is typically interpreted by progressive stack practitioners to mean white or male or young adult, while non-dominant groups include women, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, non-white people, and very young or older people.    The ""stack"" in the Occupy movement is the list of speakers who are commenting on proposals or asking questions in public meetings. Anyone can request to be added to the stack. In meetings that don't use the progressive stack, people speak in the order they were added to the queue. In meetings that use the progressive stack, people from non-dominant groups are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, by facilitators, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to ""step forward, or step back"" based on which racial, age, or gender group they belong to.

It's a useful thought exercise to do for yourself to ask what unconscious biases you have (we all have them) but the way it's usually used is to tell someone to shut up and know their place.   some extremely poor people get scholarships and tuition assistance - is that poor privilege?   In that case I'd say no since it's intended to make up for a lack of resources others have. However you could be poor and have privilege in other ways like your race or sex. I'd say privilege is much fuzzier with those two than with rich/poor.   TL;DR: It seems to me that ""privilege checking"" is just a big pissing contest, and you can always point to people with less or more privilege than you, regardless of social status, age, gender, race, because we are all unique with unique upbringings and life experiences.

As it stands, there is little reason to panic. People are often quick to insist that TiA is a hateful and vitriolic subreddit that harasses the bloggers it links. I won't deny this ever happening, but it is imperative to remember that this is a minority of users.  TiA on a whole has never, and will never, endorse harassment of any kind. Indeed, it is fairly frequent that we ban users for harassing the bloggers (breaking rule 1). The admins are aware of this, and are aware that we take all steps we can to prevent harassment.  But what about all those subs that just got banned? Well, with the exception of /r/FatPeopleHate these were all relatively small subs, and at least 2 of them I personally know harassed reddit users. Now, I recognize that that is little excuse on a website supposedly dedicated to free speech, but it's important to recognize that TiA does not do these things.  TiA is unlikely to get banned any time soon, though it may be abandoned in a reddit mass-exodus, because the admins are kinda digging their own graves."

Seriously, if SRS was mind-controlling the admins, they would've gone after a much longer list of hate subs. FPH was targeted because of its size and prominence, and very explicit hateful intent. Whatever reddit's little constitution is, it's still a company with a fiduciary duty not to alienate all its advertisers.  It also, y'know, WAS known for generating direct harassment of individuals, including, recently, Imgur staff. In fact the Imgur thing was probably the tipping point. That's really not a practice you can reasonably equate with SRS brigading.  Anyway, like I said, I predict that this thread will be a really interesting indicator of how TiAD breaks down along the lines of cancer/cabal/Paoyongyang hysteria.

I fully expect TiA to get killed by the Paotriarchy for ""harassment"" or ""hate speech"" or some bullshit. I don't support this new direction at all, but well I've already written a long post about the current state of TiA so I won't shed too many tears when it happens. It won't kill the community TiA has cultivated anyway - Voat already has a TiA of its own and I'm pretty sure 8chan does too.  And that's all I really have to say on the wider issue of how Reddit is now being run too. People will just move to better sites. Reddit is committing suicide if they continue killing popular communities and forcing those users away.   There is no need to get mad and create conspiracies, however freedom of speech has always been a basic rule of Reddit and banning controversial communities in order to create a ""safe space"" is completely opposed to that ideal.  Of course they have the right to revoke their free speech rule as a private organisation, but likewise the users have a right to move to better sites. Voat and 8chan are right over there, there is nothing super special about Reddit. Some subreddits that have been anticipating a ban for a while even already have their own dedicated forums ready to go for when the Purge strikes.  Nothing will change at the end of the day as far as the communities behind these subs go. The existing users will just scatter to different parts of the net. All that will happen is Reddit will lose a massive portion of its userbase.  Can you Diggit?"

TiADiscussion,39bzwg,nothin_incriminating,24,Wed Jun 10 20:27:53 2015 UTC,FPH allowed only screenshots and enforced blacking out of personal info. They technically take more precautions against brigading than TiA currently does.

I'm not hating on TiA and how it's run, I'm just saying if the admins want to shut the place down they can still make an excuse for it no matter what you do.  Whether or not that will happen has yet to be seen but let's face it, this isn't looking good so far. First the CEO announces Reddit will be a safe space. Not even a month later FPH is banned. I think they will shut down all controversial communities in time. I don't know if the decision is ideological or business orientated but either way I think it is very likely to happen."

I dunno, I think you're overestimating how many people come to reddit for the unregulated identity politics bitchfest. If they start policing free speech beyond what would be permitted if they were the US government instead of a private company (and I doubt that they will), well, that would suck, but I would still hang out here among other communities of hobbyists and garden-variety slackers.  Honestly, I think people who overly fret about the admin police state need to stand up and go outside.

Do not underestimate the number of people who use Reddit solely for these big subs like FPS or TiA and solely for the purpose of blowing off steam and saying things which would be considered politically incorrect. Those users make up most of Reddit including the defaults. If they have to tip toe around eggshells they will go to another site where they don't.  This is a buyer's market. A simple internet message board is a dime a dozen. Anyone can make one if they can be bothered to pay for a hosting account these days.

Those hobbyist or self-improvement subs with real utility, or just mindless entertainment subs? Are there any other sites with such large communities organized around such specific, fractal subjects?

That doesn't mean the whole site is bitching about SJWs, it just means people want to enjoy the relative anonymity of the internet by venting and having guilty pleasures.  I think some hobbyist subs will remain sure, but how big are those compared to the defaults, let alone FPH or TiA, most of which contain non-PC comments constantly. I don't think the defaults will get deleted but more heavily moderated absolutely.  The above includes ""mindless entertainment subs."" They all make jokes which could be considered offensive.  And even the ""hobbyist"" subs... how will they decide what to keep? Perhaps /r/trees is not a ""safe space"" because it discusses and encourages illegal activities. You can throw /r/drugs out too then. /r/darknetmarkets definitely has to go. /r/onions and /r/tor would also have to go then.  And so on... if they ban things due to feels they can literally ban anything. And even if they don't, the things they do ban will alienate enough of their users that it will cause damage to the site.

If they had gone full bore they would have destroyed reddit almost immediately. Instead, they did the ""smart"" thing. Ban a couple of subs and let the backlash die down. Sure reddit will lose some views but not a whole lot (or so they thought).  They were hoping to inch their way towards a sanitized, marketable reddit. Unfortunately for them, unless they're planning on selling out really soon it's not going to work. The only reason this site is so popular is because of their (former) commitment to free speech. With that ideal now gone, this site is going to start hemorrhaging users and its marketability is going to drop fast. It's already being reported that voat.co is experiencing slowdowns from the influx of new users, what do you think is going to happen after the next round of ideologically motivated bannings?"
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,RedAero,20,Thu Jun 11 00:44:35 2015 UTC,Yep. They wouldn't kill off a lot of subs all at once. They will space it out and take time to make up their reasons. But Reddit is now Digglr if this is the future of how the admins will act.
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,SirSoliloquy,4,Wed Jun 10 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"So why stop at FPH? What about the other fatshaming subs like fatlogic and FPS? Why go for the big, popular one if they're trying to sanitize reddit of fatshaming?"
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,RedAero,19,Wed Jun 10 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"So why stop at FPH?   Because they're attempting two things at the same time. They want to ""clean up"" reddit but they also want to keep their users around.  Someone thought that banning FPH and HamPlanetHatred would accomplish both these goals but banning all the fat hate would be going too far. If ideology was their sole concern I've no doubt that we'd see a fully sanitized (and nearly empty) reddit.  I'll believe it's only about 'safe spaces' once they start banning subs from the SRS side of things (Ghazi, Bluepill, badhistory, etc.). Since that will never happen, I'll never believe it."
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Raudskeggr,8,Wed Jun 10 20:10:58 2015 UTC,From what I understand is FPH had a big problem with users tracking down the people posted there and harrasing them. Like it was said above they did the same with imgur staff. It seems that the bannings are more about the poop touching and less about the hateful opinions.
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Wylanderuk,5,Wed Jun 10 20:39:13 2015 UTC,"If we see more of this happening regularly, we'll know it's true.

TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Huitzil37,13,Wed Jun 10 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"Of course the community was hated. Even non-SJWs found it easy to hate a sub formed around the hatred of fat people. So yeah, if you read the threads about its banning you'll have a lot of people talking about how disgusting the sub was.  You know what you won't find though? Any evidence of brigading or  harassing. There's a lot of people saying that it happened, there's a lot of assertions without evidence that it occurred. No one links to anything though.  Contrast that with SRS. You can see their brigades roll in and the scores dip before the almost inevitable backlash causes karma to rise again. If you ask for evidence of SRS brigading/harassing you can get well documented cases. Evidence of FPH doing the same? Not so much.  If this was really only about harassing/brigading, SRS would be the first to go. Everyone knows it, even the SRSters."

SJWs don't take things over by threatening people in power so they unwillingly comply with SJW demands. SJWs take over by threatening people in power until they become SJWs themselves.

They won't tread carefully and won't stick to their reported policy. They are not capable of that.

They already showed that the stated policy is a sham. If they were really intent on getting rid of brigading, doxing, and harassing subreddits, SRS would have been one of the first to go.  But doing that would be the death knell for reddit. If an SRS sub were to be banned, SRSters would immediately take to their blogs, twitter, tumblr, etc. and decry the ""hate"" they experienced. Some of the most prolific writers for the victimhood industry are among the SRS ""alumni"". Sarkeesian, Wu, Wong, Futrelle, etc, have a huge amount of pull and wouldn't hesitate to burn it to the ground.

TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Lepontine,10,Wed Jun 10 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"People were still being harrased though and sending the people posted their nasty comments/emails/whatever. Hell, just yesterday or the day before Imgur staff was getting harrasing messages (and no, it wasn't just politely disagreeing with the decision). They did have a problem with people harrasing the individuals posted on that sub and apparently the mods didn't do enough to stop it.   I'm not going to say the ""behavior, not ideas"" line is 100% bullshit. There are a plethora of legit racist, homophobic, etc subs that they could have banned today but didn't. I'm taking a wait and see approach for now."
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Magoonie,7,Wed Jun 10 19:25:22 2015 UTC,People could say the exact same thing about TiA.  They were very strict and honestly probably even strict than TiA is.

TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Gravelord-_Nito,17,Wed Jun 10 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"TiA and FPH are different though. FPH just posts somebody because they are fat. TiA doesn't post something just because a person is queer/a women/disabled/etc, things that are posted here are because somebody says something stupid. That stupid thing they said is the point of discussion for TiA.   Also from what I'm understanding is FPH users really were getting out of control with the no touching the poop rule and their mods weren't doing enough to stop it. TiA mods seem to be more on top of it and while we occasionally have a poop toucher, it's not that common."
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Gravelord-_Nito,7,Wed Jun 10 19:28:25 2015 UTC,The most important thing is we tackle the full range of the people that are controlling what subs stay and go.  We oppose them directly and they will find some reason to ban us too. I don't claim to have visited fph much but I did coincidentally go over there over the last 48 hours and they were set up exactly like we were.   They'll have a reason to ban us just like they did fph and r/niggers but instead of being straight forward and explaining we hurt their fees we will be told we broke some kind of reddit wide rule like the others.
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,ArchangelleBorgore,8,Wed Jun 10 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"Most of my experience from FPH comes from SRD (boy has that sub gone downhill in the past year) and the linked drama. I'm not saying you are wrong by the way, you may very well be right. I'm taking more of a ""let it play out and see where it goes"" attitude. I am interested in how this is going to go though.  I remember when the admins tried to draw more women into Reddit by making TwoX a default. Most people saw it as a mistake and they were right as it ended up hurting two subs, both TwoX and TrollX."

TiADiscussion,39bzwg,Gravelord-_Nito,3,Wed Jun 10 21:02:21 2015 UTC,Except fph was very strict and mods were super active. Banning any post that contained personal information or links to people. I don't think I ever seen a post with personal information last more than a minute. And people who were found to brigade did get banned as well.
TiADiscussion,39bzwg,ArchangelleBorgore,2,Thu Jun 11 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"Really? I'll be honest I don't know that much about FPH as it wasn't a sub I frequented. Most of what I saw was drama through SRD or when it hit the ""all"" page.im just wondering how common was it that users would touch the poop? I do remember one incident where a women found out her picture was on FPH (she was in some shallow water). She complained about it on social media and contacted the mods to take it down. This was all posted on FPH. Not too long later she shared nasty, harrasing messages she recieved through her social media.   I'm just wondering how common stuff like that happened. And I do believe behavior like that is unacceptable and the users responsible should be shadow banned."

I mean in TiA or any meta like sub the people featured aren't actively bothering the people on that sub. I have seen trans people bothered by otherkins though since they feel it makes a mockery of legitimate trans people and the issues they face.   Anyway, I think you're trying to compare Otherkin post to FPH posts and I do believe there is a difference. The comments in otherkin posts are more in line with what you just said with it being a weird community and those involved being silly with some playful mockery. I don't see widespread hate and nastiness in those comments. Of course you'll see the occasional asshole but that's rare.   It might just be me but I've been seeing less otherkin on TiA which I'm all for. The topic has gotten old and it's the same jokes/comments every time. It gets a bit tiresome. There's actually a few jokes in TiA I wish would just be retired."

She withdraws her consent from this afterward (because his was, by the standards, already withdrawn due to incapacitation), but continues the oral sex because she feels ""pressured to"" by the fact that there are people in the room outside.  If you withdraw consent from oral sex performed as a woman on a man, all you need to do is stop sucking his dick. It's not hard, particularly when the man whose dick you are sucking is out, and not exactly able to shove your head anywhere.    How. Just.... how?"

How can they make him responsible for the existence of other people? Even those people shouldn't be made responsible for a woman deciding she ""feels pressured"" without their knowledge or intent.

This bit though sounds like a conspiracy theory. You're presuming that SJWs have some sort of infrastructure and leadership more than the charismatic leader/grab your pitchforks type they've shown in the past.

Maybe they'll work out from there but I doubt it, SJWs are terrified of black women ""side eyeing"" them.  They've already been caught doing it already - that video where the woman walked through the street being catcalled, it was nearly all black dudes doing it and they did massive damage control- but the race aspect has been keeping them back. Being called racist is white kryptonite. I think what will happen is (like Leigh Alexander complaining about ""Hood Men"") they will attack the culture of masculinity first in a more abstract way and then work their way to the specifics.   This will be hard because there's so many urban white females trying desperately to appeal to black culture (upper-middle-class trust fund bitches wearing giant hoop earrings and saying ""on fleek"" with the cadence of a librarian. See: Broad City, Girls, etc.) Ultimately, they have made inroads into bitching about hip-hop through white apologists like Macklemore and Iggy Azalea, with the co-signing of Nation of Islam cunts like Jay Electronica and Tumblr Radfem retards like Azalea Banks so I don't think it's that far off.   The good news is that since hip hop, despite being a very progressive and radicalized culture, is very conservative and will actually fight back against this shit. I mean, hip hop culture is like the SJW boogeyman: a bunch of loud, strong men appropriating other peoples' work and cultures, surrounding themselves with sexuality that they seek to dominate and is strongly capitalistic. Plus you can throw in the homophobia, violence, transphobia, and general offensive subject matter.  They're not going to win that battle and if there's one thing hip hop culture is good at it's making white people feel like shit, so I don't think these SJWs will get far. Their own eagerness to claim racism about everything will turn on them."

TiADiscussion,39b994,iamyo,29,Wed Jun 10 17:52:20 2015 UTC,"It goes like this:  Gay men are sexist because they hate vaginas. Also they are cis males so inherently bad.

Another way to look at them could be ""transtrender,"" someone who wants to be transgender for internet status. I think it was them who came up with the term ""truscum,"" which refers to people who experience the dysphoria and get the surgery. It's as if to say ""those transsexuals are such elitists."""

OP is asking why they chose the words 'tucute' and 'truscum' to describe those concepts.  Truscum seems obvious enough - they're people who say that you're only truly trans if you have dysphoria. And presumably the people who think they're scum are the ones who picked the name.  And they gave a cutesy little name to themselves, but why they picked 'tucute' is a mystery to me."

TiADiscussion,39b994,iamyo,14,Sat Jun 13 07:25:25 2015 UTC,"I can't speak so much on them turning on transgender people but I do know about them turning more and more on gay/bi men. It seems like a general attitude is developing with SJW's/some feminists where they seem to be throwing queer men under the bus. Examples are that big women's conference in U.K where they voted and passed a motion banning gay men from appropriating black women culture (that's kinda offensive to me tbh). Rose Mcgowen I think her name is (she was the redhead on Charmed) bitching out gay men for going to a LGBT+ charity event instead of her feminist event and getting snippy with them. Even an article on a feminist website on why marriage equality is bad. Numerous articles about how gay men are inherently misogynistic. Like I said it's a general attitude that is growing a bit.  My theory on why this is happening is because gay men are getting more and more acceptance and rights. I think the SJW's are thinking that because of this, on the oppression scale of wonder gay men are getting closer to straight men in power and privelage and whatever else they think of. And we all know how they feel about straight men!  Another factor I have a theory on is gay men are really starting to distance themselves from the ""pet fag"" role. Some women out there seem to believe that they are owed a gay friend to go shopping with, gossip with, etc. These are commonly called Fag Hags, I've run into some and I'm not a fan. Now, just because a women is friends with a gay man doesn't mean she fits into this category. But you can usually sense if they do, basically they just want to be friends with you just because you are gay. There's a pushback against fag hags and I think that's causing some resentment.   I know this was long winded but I hope I answered your question. Feel free to ask any others you have."
TiADiscussion,39b994,doubleunplussed,14,Wed Jun 10 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I guess as an older woman I would say that the first I ever even HEARD about feminism was from a very out gay man (youngest and  most out gay man I'd ever met in college at that point). He was a super duper RAD feminist, completed my conversation to feminism (but with good arguments for he is an intellectual powerhouse) and then told me that many gay men are misogynist. This was his view. But that last thing I still don't get because gay men rarely have the personal anger that misogynists usually have.   It's blowing my mind feminism is a thing now--I only get this from reddit. 25 years ago the only feminists were like this one woman English professor. And everyone hated her and said she was a dyke. Feminism was not on the radar of most people and when it was it was a bad thing.    Somehow it is seen on reddit as the mainstream thing everyone does and being against it is the radical thing.  But in real life, how many feminists are there, really?  Ever since my friend said this, I try to understand what he means-- I've never actually met a misogynist gay man. I spent much time in San Francisco way back in the day and gay men were very big on their space and not wanting women in their space. So there were restaurants it was pointless to go to because the waiters would never take your order--or would like 10 hours later. But that's not misogyny, I don't think. They created a 'gay man space' in the Castro district. It was really just a way to make the space gay men only, I'm pretty sure.  But you couldn't keep teens out of the gay bars and clubs because they were so much better.   Does it still exist, this space? That's one of the weird ironies of gay acceptance. The more the wider society makes it no big deal the less need there is for a very definitive culture of gay men only. Oppression is bad but it does bring people together in a weird way.  I don't think I was a fag hag but I did have a lot of gay & lesbian friends. But I had a lot of Asian friends, lesbian friends--just whomever you meet who is social will introduce you to their social network and I am not social but I do get lucky and find extroverted friends.   I cannot imagine a single one of my gay male friends every wanting to go shopping--with me or any woman. This might be a high school thing-like a young thing to survive the horrors of teen social life until you meet more gay men.  Does it continue in adult life?  I'm really troubled by this whole thing. We only get any progress when people are allies--gay men, lesbians, women, people of color, everyone. In my history, people can be snippy but they are generally allies and patient with each other--and try to have a dialogue that is mutually enriching and makes us better people and more able to live together in society.  I also like people to be kind and understanding toward one another general. You know--kind to Republicans they meet even if they are freaked out about the Republican party, try to listen to what people say and think about it for a bit even if it seems HORRIBLY WRONG because there is the tiny chance you are wrong, etc. That last one can drive you crazy though.  I guess social media is making this all really difficult. And people don't have so much interpersonal contact in real life with people who are different from them. Everything becomes a battle and an echo chamber.   Now I'm just this old lady saying 'kids today!' shaking my head, sadly."
TiADiscussion,39b994,iamyo,2,Wed Jun 10 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"how many feminists are there, really?   As an educated person with liberal politics, they are everywhere. I use OKCupid pretty often, and every second profile mentions how she spends her time smashing the patriarchy, and how you shouldn't message her if you don't think there's a rape culture. I'm not exaggerating at all. These people might be in the minority in the group of ""humanity as a whole"", but they are overrepresented in the group of ""people a left-winger is likely to encounter on campus, at political events, and on dating websites"".  On OKC they are highly matched with me because we're on the same side of poitics. And because there's no politically feasible way to exclude them - the only way I could make sure I'm not matched with them is to answer that ""A woman's place is in the home"", or ""yes, women have an obligation to shave their genitals"" in the match questions, things that I don't believe, and would make sane women think I was a bit nutty.  It's hard to meet liberal educated women who haven't absorbed at least a bit of the insanity.

Once people have $15/hr paychecks, they will start spending, which will increase most small business' customer base. Which will increase demand and increase the employment opportunities.  That wont happen as long as there is fighting about it, and it looks like it will be, like all other regulations, fighting tooth and nail to get enacted - and by the time it does get enacted, it'll be outdated and too low an amount.

An ""economic SJW"" will typically hold views left of European-style social democracy, and will put everything in terms of sticking it to the rich, as opposed to simply making them pay somewhat higher (in percentage) taxes and removing special tax breaks from them. It is an ideology based more on hatred of the rich rather than the prosperity of the average person. Of course, these kinds of economic SJWs were the founders of socialism back in the day; they don't use the label anymore because socialism failed. It is this socialism that John Maynard Keynes could not stand; he wondered ""how a doctrine so illogical and so dull can  have exercised so powerful and enduring an influence over the minds of men, and, through them, the events of history."" He added that ""class war will find [him] on the side of the educated bourgeoisie.""  It has been found that the furthest left economic policy that works well is the Scandinavian social democratic system, and even that is a fundamentally capitalist system with a generous welfare state that does its best to not impact the labor market. Also, those Scandinavian countries, even though they pay high taxes, those taxes aren't exactly punitive, and their top-class government services make them worth the cost to their citizens.

It is related to xenomelia, ""the oppressive feeling that one or more limbs of one's body do not belong to one's self"".   BIID is typically accompanied by the desire to amputate one or more healthy limbs to achieve that end. BIID can be associated with apotemnophilia, sexual arousal based on the image of one's self as an amputee. The cause of BIID is unknown. One theory states that the cause of BIID is a neurological failing of the brain's inner body mapping function (located in the right parietal lobe). According to this theory, the brain mapping does not incorporate the affected limb in its understanding of the body's physical form.

This will collide with the subtle acceptance of pedophilia in general on places like Reddit and the Chans (despite many vocal opponents including /pol/ and many feminists, unlikely allies.)  All these weird, fucked up worlds will meet. We will be having debates about age of consent and how they should have the freedom to date an older person but they don't consent to sex, until they do.   I can see it starting a few ways, but I think it's going to have to do with teens aggressively sexualizing themselves in online and spaces and in public, then it will go ""just because I am doing this does not give you the right to objectify/sexualize me"" (which is already happening,) and then ""so what if I want to be objectified? It's my body,"" and then ""talking to older men helps some of us with our self esteem, some of us need that acceptance and encouragement"" (because predators tell them whatever they want to hear, of course.) Like how we used to laugh at things years ago as so over-the-top, then watched in horror as they become accepted and seriously debated, we will see the dawn of fucking NAMBLA validation.   This may all sound overblown but I actually think ""age"" will be some sort of future-front in this movement which is largely either racial or sexual and has a lot of very young people involved.   Aside from that?  Drugs.  I can see a lot of the ""grown up"" SJWs idolizing damaged people (as they often do) and they might push for some junkie-acceptance bullshit."
TiADiscussion,397ual,fuckingliterally,9,Wed Jun 10 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find it, but there's been an article posted on TiA about the writer of some big news site defending a female teacher having sex with one of her elementary school students, basically just saying ""oh, little boys would kill to fuck their teacher!"" type shit. Pedophilia acceptance is already on it's way, I just seriously doubt it'll ever include male pedophilia, for obvious reasons.  As for ending drug prohibition, that's also a productive goal, so I doubt that'll ever happen. They'll probably try to criminalize alcohol consumption before legalizing any others."

That's a legitimate, political, Libertarian-leaning thing and I think they not only don't give a shit about actual change, they're spooked by everything ""right wing"" which they think Libertarianism is.  I said it mainly because these people compulsively identify with the underdog; in the same sense that they use Marxist terminology not because they have anything to say about the working class, but because they hate the mean rich people and all the power they have. They have a child's understanding of how the world works and it only goes so far as individual rights, meaning stuff they can anecdotally prove.  So I can totally see them going to bat not for drug legalization, but the way people treat junkies and addicts. They won't have anything to say beyond ""these people are people!"" A reasonable person would say that total drug legalization platform should go hand-in-hand with increased mental help and addiction prevention initiatives, but these people don't give a shit about that, they want us just to stop being bullies to the crackhead on the corner."

This is already a thing with the more cutting-edge SJWs, less cutting-edge SJWs will be accepting of it and reblog things even if they're not yelling about it themselves. Poly ships are increasingly popular in fandoms too. There are polyamory groups out there thriving, and they're starting to hit mainstream (I've seen a few articles on them), and I think it's only a matter of time before they start clamoring for the right to marry multiple partners. Once that starts the SJWs will latch on and turn the rhetoric around polyamory sour. They'll come up with something like poly-phobic and shit on ""monogamous scum"" or whatever. I think I'd actually support legalized poly marriage because why the hell not, but I'm not looking forward to the latter part.   My second guess which will hopefully never go mainstream and just stay in the SJW-o-sphere is aromantic allosexuals. (That means they're sexually attracted to people but not romantically attracted.) There are a few blogs out there dedicated to them and they are all cesspools of SJW jargon and bitterness. I don't think it will be long before they're recognized as the bottom (top?) of the aromantic/asexual food chain given that they get left out of aro/ace recognition weeks and support posts and all that. Excluding them will soon make you a shitlord of the highest degree."

However, I would agree with the goal of feminism; that is equality between men and women. I would definitely call myself socially liberal, somewhat economically liberal with support for a semi-regulated capitalist market, with a bit of libertarianism thrown in for good measure. Basically I can see the pros of most political philosophies that people propose.  With that said, it's not so much the underlying ideology (wanting equality between all peoples; but that term has different meanings depending on who you ask) that SJWs stand for that I hate, but the damaging way in which they try to go about trying to achieve it. I think that their reactionary, call-out culture, and hypocrisy does more damage the goal of achieving equality more than anything else and as a socially liberal person, that bothers me.   For some SJWs they are misguided, or in their own way have a hypocritical logic behind their views, or other just following the crowd because it's the 'in thing' to do.  The thing with the whole SJW philosophy is extreme black and white thinking (oppressor vs. oppressed, white vs. PoC, etc.) with a lot of actor-observer bias (basically anything wrong that happens in their life is the result of someone or something else cough the patriarchy instead of some failing of their own), and application of a lot of relativism (which is where the lack of criticism for problems like misogyny in other cultures comes into play).  As a person dealing with black and white thinking in some aspects of their live, I can sympathize with how hard it is to shake it off, although that is not to excuse it. I can understand why these three features of the SJW philosophy are so prevalent, but again that is not to excuse it.  Don't make the mistake of thinking their are SJW feminists, radical feminists and academic feminists. There are a lot of overlap between the three. Most of the SJW ideas have some history in academia. I've see it turn well intentioned, nice and caring people into bitter hateful 'activists' after taking the 'social justice' type courses in university."

We see these ideologies everywhere and their two common traits are starting at a conclusion and working backwards, and having a ""logical"" answer for everything (even though the ""logic"" usually defies reality, and most classic rules of logic). This is the way every cult has operated.  I come to TiA for a sort of schadenfreude at the expense of those that have fallen for these toxic, black-and-white ideologies."

TiADiscussion,395b2b,Vilsetra,6,Tue Jun 9 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"What I'm referring to are trains of thought like this: * Patriarchy is the subjugation of women by men for the benefit of men * Men are also harmed by the patriarchy  Those two cannot be true at the same time because the second argument nullifies the first one since a system set up to benefit men cannot simultaneously harm men.  I think that it is better to call 'the patriarchy', societal expectations (making it gender neutral since both men and women contribute to enforcing the expectations that each gender has attached with it). I would go so far as to not refer to the West as even patriarchal since while there are fewer women in positions of power, they are by no means forbidden from occupying those positions (the wants of women aside)."

Both Fundies and RadFems operate in a similar fashion, as in they take the most literal interpretation of their basic premises and follow them to their natural conclusion. And just like with both ideologies, their moderates can be genuinely good people, but that doesn't mean that their beliefs can't be fundamentally flawed (or that their beliefs are based in a philosophical tradition grounded in fundamentally flawed ideas).

TiADiscussion,395b2b,Autumn-Moonlight,7,Wed Jun 10 08:12:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, there is a couple things that I would like to see happen that SJW's talk about a lot. I'd like to see more positive LGBT representation in the media besides just gay and occasionally a not super sexualities lesbian. Especially trans representation, now I'm not saying we need ten trans characters in every show, I'm just saying there's so few and among that few there's a minuscule amount of them not poorly portraying trans people. I think if a few of the popular shows threw in one or two (with personalities and characters beyond their identity) it would really help fix the public opinion to trans people are all mentally ill men in dresses, and with the whole Jenner thing going on its clear the public would benefit. I also would like to see at least one talked about non-binary character. This one is a little more personal to me, but I still want a little more discussion about the non-binary that isn't completely stupid. It also might make it a little more of a pressing issue in the world of psychology and could launch studies exploring why some people consider themselves both male and female or neither. This would personally help me and a lot of non-binary people to come out as we'd have something to base our identity off of and have clarification that we aren't bullshiting ourselves, and gives us something to explain to people close to us if they call it bullshit. It could also help differentiate from the people who really aren't trans/non-binary before they get hormones and surgery like a dumbass. Obviously these aren't the top priority issues of the entire world, but they still mean something to me.   SJW's do talk about things that are actually important sometimes, they do it rarely and when they do they usually type unintelligibly, but they do it. I just think most of the time people here dismiss actual problems simply because an SJW brought it up and that somehow automatically makes it trivial."

TiADiscussion,395b2b,pineyfusion,8,Wed Jun 10 03:23:04 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a feminist but I'm more of the feminism of the individual as in I would like to be treated as my own person with my own views and my own opinions. I'd like to represent myself and not be the voice for anybody else since that wouldn't be fair to them. I'd like the right to suck at something and not have it be attributed to my gender. And I'd like the right for other women to be treated as such too. I don't want to be shamed for my choices in life unless if the choices do warrant shame (and only if that shame would also be put upon men in society who make those same choices) and I don't want to be defined solely by labels. Modern feminism wants to be defined by their own prettier labels that don't go into the heart of any of the issues their labels stand for.   And the thing is that when I do call myself a feminist, I piss everybody off. Some think of me as a misandrist who thinks that everything is sexist and that I'm a moron for thinking that there's legitimate misogynistic problems in the world and that calling myself a feminist isn't the right term. On the other side, they don't think I'm the right kind of feminist (I actually had a feminist say this to me before IRL) because I want to see women called out on their shit and I find that the feminist movement these days has a hard time doing this.   I think that rape culture is a thing on college campuses but I think a lot of it has to do with a lack of education and a lack of anybody having actual honest conversations about rape and sexual assault. People are just fearmongering and afraid to talk about this stuff out of fear for hurting others in one way or another. How else are we going to be able to move forward if we can't talk about this and actually have honest and legitimate debates?! I get that PTSD is a thing and I get that some people get triggered by things and they have my sympathy. However, it's just so frustrating because rape culture is something that should be addressed but everytime it's addressed, someone will get uncomfortable if someone doesn't say the right thing and then claim that they're triggered.   I think that privilege is a thing but I feel like they talk about all this other privilege stuff but they miss out on the biggest aspect of privilege -- economic privilege/social class privilege. That is extremely important and the fact that people don't check this privilege really bothers me. Nobody's asking you to stop talking about privilege, but if you have a privilege and you're going to ask others to check it, then be sure to check your own including if you or your parents make good money. Yes a rich white man will have more privilege than a rich black man. However, I find it hard to believe that a rich black man will have less privilege than a poor white man.   I'm a liberal socially and situationally economically. The latter means more that in an ideal world I'd be more economically conservative but because the system is so fucked up against poorer people now, I'm economically liberal so that they can actually have a chance or get a break to help pick themselves up off the ground. It's hard to say ""Fuck you, I got mine"" when others have been working just as hard and get nowhere because of things that work against them in one way or another.   Racism is a problem in this world still but to act like it's not a thing that white people experience is kind of ignorant. Of course, at least in the USA, it's not to the level of others but it's still there. The racism that we hear being talked about that white people in the US don't experience is institutionalized racism. I feel like just calling that just racism (like the stuff we see these days with the police and other racist bullshit out there) takes away a lot from the issue. It gives away an air of acceptance of the matter rather than saying institutionalized racism which makes it sound like something that need to be changed and changed now.  Also, the equation of racism = prejudice + power is actually a very weak argument because you can take that equation and you can use it easily to prove the point about how racism against white people IS a thing. It's all in the lens that you use. Like say you zoom into a certain neighborhood that is predominantly black and say a white guy gets beat up. The white guy isn't in powers since he is outnumbered. Wouldn't that be considered racism? Or what about if you look to Hawaii? Does that mean there's no such thing as racism in Hawaii because there is no majority population (also when you look into the state government, it's racially diverse too)? Or say we take the lense and move it over to other countries. White people sure as hell aren't in power in Asia...if they were kidnapped or they were beaten on account of their race, how is that not considered racism? Or even Zimbabwe where white folk aren't allowed to own property and are actually oppressed by the government in that country? You see that equation is faulty to begin with so to use that equation is not very helpful to their argument.   The thing that bothers me the most about this SJW stuff is the absolutely condescending tone towards others and the way that the people that they're trying to help in one way or another are treated so infantile and like victims. Victim is a terminology that I despise because it's so impersonal and it treats somebody as a statistic rather than a human being. People should be treated like human beings, not as agendas or subhumans. We're all in this shit together and we're all individuals.

And realy, i wont think of her as a woman. I cant help myself in that. I know a trans woman in real life and you know what. It ends up beeing weird. Ideologically, i can at least treat her as an undateable woman. But when it comes to how my brain reacts to her its basically an out of the ordinary scenario that i dont have any direct answers for.   Socialism   i consider myself an economic socialist, so im obviously biased here, but yeah i see myself as one. I think most SJWs realy only go for cultural marxism, they dont even give a shit about the economic implications of socialism   Multiculturalism   Multiculturalism is just a nice sounding code word for Segregated Society which always leads to poverty, different standards in education and crime.  Furthermore i dont believe that western countries should become Multicultural in any possible definition.  The People native to a country have a self given right to that country as far as im concerned. A right that only they themselves can uphold.   I think every nation should have a place to grow unhindered and to govern itself, without international sensibilities hindering it, as long as actual self governance is in place.  So basically i dont count fascist systems or places where  a large part of the population doenst get a say such as women in saudi arabia.  Im also not a fan of cultural Globalism and i think that distinct ethnicities and cultures make the world and interresting place. The notion of ""diversity"" as it is pushed by SJWs is imo highly undiverse and actually just just boiling it all down to something extremley shallow and inoffensive."

TiADiscussion,395b2b,losinwanderluster,2,Sat Jun 13 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"For all intents and purposes, I agree with 90% of the issues that Tumblrinas stand for. As a woman, I very much appreciate the work that feminists have done to pave the way for my generation. But I really don't appreciate radical feminists who claim that their experience represents the experience of ALL women. My gender has never in my life been a barrier for me; if anything, it's been a privilege. As an upper middle class white woman with two degrees working in a field dominated by women, it would be utterly laughable for me to claim to be oppressed by society. I realize that most women in the world aren't nearly as lucky, and therefore feminism is a necessary thing. Hell, I even call myself a feminist. How could I NOT, knowing that just 50 years ago the life I lead would have been nearly impossible?   But Tumblr feminists just piss me off, and I can't even put my finger on WHY. I think it's the patronizing tone of nearly every single of their posts and their incessant victim complex. It's like they want every woman to feel like a victim of SOMETHING, like they're fragile little porcelain dolls who need to be coddled and protected at all costs. And like, that's the same mindset that dominated the Victorian Era. Women were held on a pedestal in society, considered too fragile and virtuous for things like politics, heavy labor, and even ""offensive language."" If Tumblr feminists want a ""safe space"" they ought to look no farther than the ladies' parlors of the 19th century, to which women were relegated during social events while then men talked about weightier matters.   Furthermore, radical feminists have this notion that if the world were ruled by women, everything would magically be better. As if female politicians would magically not be corrupt or bigoted or stupid. I suppose I'm just of the opinion that women are EQUAL to men, no better, no worse. Anything a man can do, a woman can do, including mess up a country. (I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter and I'm so sick and tired of people telling me I should support Hillary instead because she'd be ""the first female president!"")   I guess a major theme that feeds into my annoyance with Tumblr social justice is the constant slinging of accusations that aren't backed by substance. When ""rape"" can mean anything from ""attacked at gun point by a sexual predator"" to ""a man looked at me lustfully"" and ""racism"" can mean anything from ""literally in the KKK"" to ""12-year-old white girl with dreadlocks,"" the words become ambiguous and lose their weight. Hell, I've been called a racist on Tumblr for drawing humanized fanart of a KIDS' SHOW and not making the main character black (canonically, they are all animals, for christs' sake).   Obviously, some things are just wrong and should be addressed. But this ""callout culture"" just gets tiring. Literally everyone on the planet makes mistakes; everyone holds certain prejudices, and everyone says dumb things. We can be like ""hey man, that thing you said wasn't very considerate to X group of people"" without being like ""LET'S DOXX THIS GUY BECAUSE HE'S A RACIST HOMOPHOBIC ASSHOLE."" I just think that every story is much more complex than it seems, but Tumblr SJWs are so quick to attack people for the slightest perceived wrongdoing.   And another thing I've noticed is that it's hardly ever the people who DISAGREE with social justice causes that they go after. It's the ones who agree with them, but just not ""properly."" It's the feminists who aren't radical enough, LGBT advocates who aren't vocal enough in their support for fringe identities (think demisexual), white allies who ""step out of line"" while trying to support PoC rights, etc. It just pains me to see them attack people who, for all intents and purposes, are ON THEIR SIDE. You would think, logically, that if two people both believe that women should have equal rights in society, rape is bad, unarmed black teens shouldn't be getting shot by police, trans people should have their identities recognized, and gay people should have the right to marry, they would get along well.   As Tumblr proves, CLEARLY NOT."

TiADiscussion,395b2b,mrtrotskygrad,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"I work in historic preservation. Lol, that's why I think about 19th century parlors more than anyone probably should.   The field has historically been very influenced by women (lots of early preservation work, e.g. Mount Vernon, was advocated for by organizations like the DAR and Colonial Dames). It was an outgrowth of Victorian middle class women's social clubs, where it was acceptable for women to exercise power as long it was for ""moral advocacy"" or ""patriotism."" And there you have it, you can argue that saving George Washington's house from Old Man Developer is a moral AND patriotic issue. You still had a lot of men who funded major projects (like John D. Rockefeller and Williamsburg) and got their names on things but when you're talking grassroots advocacy, women basically got shit done. I feel like when (more like IF) people ever think about historic preservation, they picture a bunch of old ladies chaining themselves to an old building so it won't get torn down? Yeah, that's pretty much our reputation, lol.   Today, I don't know the exact demographics of the field but in my experience, there are definitely more women than men. When I was still in school, there were only like 3 men out of a class of 17. We always joked that we needed affirmative action to get more testosterone. :P I went to China on a project once and everyone on my team (save for one of the profs) was a woman, and no one even batted an eye."

Men have some advantages in society, women have some advantages, but institutional male privilege does not exist (as opposed to racial privilege).  Feminism: At this point, it's become a nice way for the histrionic and perpetually offended to make a career. :)  ""Rape Culture"": Does not exist. At least not in the United States in any significant form. I think it's a convenient boogeyman that SJWs like to bring up when trying to abrogate the rights of men accused of rape, much as the Republicans used to bring up terrorism and extremism when abrogating the rights of men accused of the former, and Americans in general.   Actually, I would say that the Republicans are more justified than the SJWs: terrorists and extremists incontrovertibly exist, whereas ""rape culture"" is still up for debate."

Where I disagree with them is when they get extreme and unrealistic, and when they come across as heavily authoritarian leftists.  They, like me, don't think it's right for people to hurt others (in most cases, self-defense is a special case). Their definition of hurt requiring group action, though, is unreasonable, and their solutions are too. Instead of using different language on their own and simply choosing not to associate with people who use words they don't like on social media, they make a big stink about it and verbally attack them. Some of them think it's OK to hit someone who makes an impolite comment, instead of the much more sane response of ignoring them, glaring with disgust, or giving them a mild insult back and not talking to them anymore. Some focus so much on how bad they feel when a doctor tells them to lose weight that they end up fighting it the wrong way - with willful denial and encouraging others into the same denial of medical facts.  Basically, in the quest to reduce harms, they cause a whole lot more than they're preventing. And that's counterproductive and why I have a problem with those types of extremism."

I reject the idea instinct tells men to procreate so they have children to pass down - instead I believe instinct tells man ""shoot load into hole"". Instinct doesn't give us 2, it gives us 1 + 1. Same for women with insertion vs pregnancy.   What about the roles that pheromones play in attraction? 'Blind tests' show that heterosexual people prefer the pheromones of the opposite gender, even when they don't actually smell anything (there has even been studies where women could rate the attractiveness of a man based off of their pheromones alone!

Racial divides were constructed in colonial Virginia to protect aristocrats from the poor people. Race made poor whites feel like they had something in common with the aristocracy (being free white citizens) so they wouldn't unite with black people to overturn the aristocracy. Imagine Bacon's rebellion combined with Nat Turner's rebellion, directed against the proper targets: that's what the aristocracy was afraid of.  Even since the Civil War, the establishment still feels threatened by anything uniting poor people across racial lines (such as the Poor People's Campaign of 1968, which was targeted by the FBI)."

Schools often emphasize the reformists who eventually got some legislation passed without mentioning the radicals who made it an issue.

They were the first, and if you think that Howard Zinn's point is right, then you should applaud the SJWs for their efforts.  Of course, having read his entire book, I understand that his bias is meant to counteract bias that is supposedly present in our textbooks that is nationalistic, reformist, and has a theme of unity in the American people as opposed to the reality of divisions and yes, conflict based on socioeconomic class. That being said, I don't take it as an authoritative account of the history of the United States, and think that the truth is probably somewhere in between."

The very idea of that culture and the ideas that made Germany able to stand up after taking any beatings and wither the storm were deemed unfit, and they as a people were castrated."

It manifests as cyclical periods of self-confidence and and worth, contrasted with periods of self-hatred and self-destruction. I'm sure someone could easily confuse that with ""changing genders"" if they've been exposed to too much tumblr level bullshit.

I wouldn't define a gender as a trait itself. If that were true, then gender and sex would be independently distributed, with as many transgender people as cisgender. We can clearly see that this is not the case.  Gender dysphoria is an uncommon trait that can lead people to be uncomfortable in their bodies and in the gender role that matches their birth sex. Most transgender and nonbinary people have dysphoria, but not all, it seems.  The reason you see so many words for gender identity is exactly because nonbinary people are so uncommon and emphasize respecting each other's identity, so there's no universalized identity for them."

I'm not sure 'societally approved' is the right term, since there are plenty of behaviours which are both gendered and disapproved of by society. e.g. sluttiness  I think what you're getting at is the idea that gender is socially defined, which I agree with.  I'm also unsure about grouping both identity and behaviours under the same term, especially as one is internal and the other external. If a pre-transition transwoman performs male behaviours for the purpose of remaining closeted, does that make them any less female-gendered? That difficulty could probably be resolved if it was changed to ""identity and natural behaviours"" though, since the relevant behaviours would then be those which flow from the identity.   I wouldn't define a gender as a trait itself. If that were true, then gender and sex would be independently distributed, with as many transgender people as cisgender.   I don't think that follows. Height and sex are obviously distinct traits, but they're not independent; there's a pretty strong correlation between them.   The reason you see so many words for gender identity is exactly because nonbinary people are so uncommon and emphasize respecting each other's identity, so there's no universalized identity for them.   Agreed. There do seem to be a few umbrella terms that are useful for describing classes of them though. e.g. genderqueer (pretty much anything non-binary) and genderfluid (anything time-varying)."

Not all gender roles are approved by society at large. Sluttiness isn't a great example because promiscuity isn't gendered and ""slut"" is just a word for a promiscuous woman.   I'm also unsure about grouping both identity and behaviours under the same term, especially as one is internal and the other external. If a pre-transition transwoman performs male behaviours for the purpose of remaining closeted, does that make them any less female-gendered?    That's just a language problem.

TiADiscussion,38zxhi,Mouon,5,Tue Jun 9 07:11:52 2015 UTC,"stereotypes about behaviour and appearance for each of those sexes   Stereotypes based to a significant extent on exaggerations of real facts about male and female behaviors and differences. There is of course bullshit and baggage from the past about gender, but it doesn't mean that gender isn't a real thing, or that the two genders, the differences between them, gender tendencies resultant from the sexes they usually naturally align to, aren't real. Very few people are not of one gender or the other.   You cannot reduce gender to mere stereotype. Its much more than that and you should be careful not to you distaste for the bullshit of stereotypes to stop you from noticing what gender really is.    Nobody conforms entirely to either one of those sets of stereotypes.   Not entirely no, but to higher or less extents many people do, and as for conforming to genders - not stereotypes - but actual gender -  few people do not, even though there is variety among people with a given gender. But again don't confuse gender with stereotype. Gender isn't just a social construct whereby anyone can choose to subscribe to any gender they want, gender is something people are born with, wired into their minds. If this were not true than gender dysphoria wouldn't be a thing. They are born with a gender that doesn't match their body, thats a fact, and they can't just choose a different gender to feel ok again. If transgendered people are born with and stuck with a certain gender, then so are we. Both gender and sex are innate, and interwoven. Maleness and femaleness are not arbitrary meaningless social constructs, they are facts of human beings, and those who don't fit into either the male or female gender are a relatively tiny minority. They don't have their own gender, or a third gender, but just don't fit into a clear gender at all, or have characteristics of both. Its not a harmonious thing though, and it probably causes significant a psychological issues for them."

Hetalia is just a comedy thing, there have been controversies all the time but most of the time it's because the idea of personified countries is simply a very sensitive subject.

People flock to social justice for the same reason they once flocked to religion—because it confers some combination of belonging, companionship, money, power, respect, status, and spiritual satisfaction. (Notice how social justice has flourished under secularism.) Perhaps the most considerable benefit is that it signals your class affiliations, indicating that you are educated, intelligent, and probably wealthy. It is no coincidence that the same politics are espoused by the most fashionable people on Earth. If fundamentalist Christianity carried the same affiliations instead of their polar opposites, we would see a lot more fundamentalist Christians. Likewise, the reason why the Nazis garnered so many supporters was in part because they created an incentive structure that made it financially and socially advantageous to be a Nazi.  So it is not possible to discern the honest from the unscrupulous because it is in the interests of the unscrupulous to be honest.  The problem with your criteria is that you assume that their disingenuous tactics betray an insincerity of opinion. In fact, it is quite the opposite. It is because they believe so strongly in their cause that they are willing to lie for it. Likewise, Goebbels was one of the most zealous Nazis.  Basically, all the people involved in social justice are genuinely for social justice, which is all the more reason to discard the concept altogether. It attracts the crazy and makes normal people crazy."

Now I'm not going to blame people for that alone. Quite frankly, many of those things I consider to be quite necessary for a good life, and as such I can't blame people for looking at those things...but generally speaking it's those things that come first and not the social justice/progress.   So we have a situation where the popular/cool thing is to embrace this notion of social justice that at the same time is both radical and does...well..nothing.   That's the problem.   Like it or not, I think generally speaking our society is going to continue to want to move towards notion of equality of some comport.

He seamlessly presents video clips of the same person years apart, as if it it were a crime to contradict yourself from three years ago.

The answer to that question was what disillusioned me about social-justice academics who wallow in oppression with no focus on solutions.

They can't even explain their own position, let alone mine, it's more like ""I'm right because feels"", and that's that. Would you still be doing it if the social circle opposed your view.  It's one reason I respect pro life people.  It's not something that will get you praise in the pop culture, in fact, most of the time it's socially unacceptable to be pro life.  Yet, they still support that cause.  Otoh the tumblrina would not be pro LGBT if it weren't already popular.  They wouldn't support Jenner if they didn't expect praise for it.  Had this blown up in 2000 or 1990 when gay was still a big deal, they wouldn't be allies. They make themselves the center of everything.  Not to say that you should not be involved, but it seems like the fakes need to be seen at the center of the action.

It means balance, rightness, correctness, wisdom, etc.   When you think about ""Justice"" applied to society, today, you'll likely come to explore familiar ways in which someone's (or some group's) definition of Justice is used to determine policy (from a legal standpoint) or culture (from a broadly interpersonal standpoint). This inevitably includes planned adjustments to language (and accompanying thinking in people), behavior, habits, learning and so on, such that a certain ""Just"" picture of society is achieved.   The problems with any pursuit of any Justice become obvious at this point: to apply/institute any Justice in a given State, one must ultimately come to wield Power over other people. If we grant that any given person can come to wield the necessary power to change society towards some Justice, we must also accept that, unless he is immortal or perfect at instilling his goals to his progeny, that his(or her) vision of Justice will eventually drop off in practice or be replaced by some other Powerful group's vision.

I agree with your critique of the tone of application of Justice in this instance, but I would point out that the argument for something being ""just a matter of law/courts"" needs to acknowledge a few fundamental caveats, first being that what is the Law is often what is reflected or imposed as the moral disposition of the People that the Law aims to govern.   So to say that what we believe/institute as Justice in the world ends with what we Legislate and uphold, that people aren't often inclined or coerced to act in accordance with such Law, is somewhat naive. There are points of divergence that can be noted here: that a Good Law would be one which simply codifies the existing moral convictions of the population at large, without issue, that a Bad Law is a Law which fails at every level of its implementation to get People to follow it or believe in it, either because it is built of falsehood or improperly enforced. Both points are somewhat related to the point I made earlier: that Justice ultimately comes to exist in Formal and Informal terms, meaning that you can ""win"" Justice for your side in either setting, the Legal and the Cultural, always.   If anyone were to decide that ""Justice is only a matter of Law,"" then the space for instituting Justice is already left radically opened for people who will simply go about and rally people to change the underlying culture surrounding the courts of law. A good example of this would be Marxism, which, in its varying critiques of society/humanity, elects to view the best and most obvious form of change (towards Justice) as ones which occur at the level of economic organization, where things like Courts and Law and even Culture are merely oppressive institutions to prevent some class of people from becoming powerful. To stand in front of this kind of criticism and just proclaim we ""leave it to the Courts"" would only add fuel the fire of the critique, which grows when it can talk about such things as oppressive conspiracies."

I'll admit I was being somewhat wordy for expediency's sake, but I think you're misinterpreting what I mean by Good and Bad in respect to a Law's existence. I mean ""Good"" insofar as a Law exists and is followed by the population it applies to, not that it reflects or fails to reflect some greater (ironically enough, given your seeming belief that all Justice is just as bad as any other Justice) state of affairs that should be followed for the moral preservation of a State, like being against Genocide or something. A Good Law, how I was phrasing it, is a Law that actualizes itself as a Law, not as possessing some Good Moral Content (although you could argue that a better Good Law is one that both actualizes itself and is the best possible Law to follow).    No its just a matter of the law. Justice isn't normative, its descriptive. Justice is a process of law, nothing more.   I'm not sure what this means, really.

You can't have some kind of world where ideas or theories are just radically separated from practice and disregarded without question.   I think you're trying to illustrate a world where there are no desires on the part of its people/institutions to change what already exists, which experience shows is not the case:  The fact that people do seem to organize themselves into movements to bring about what they view as increased ""social justice"" among themselves and others proves that Justice cannot only be what you say it is: a collection of already-existing institutions that maneuver their way through a pre-ordained legal scripture.

Should we stop conversing with one another till we're familiar with each other?  Then how should we get familiar with each other?  There's a difference between a behavior meant to annoy, and a behavior that some people find annoying.  Telling someone to smile is the later, and it's not some great horrible thing that we should force people to stop doing.

Secondly: I don't see many people who are vehemently committed to that. I saw a post with a psychological explanation of why it's more common for women to hear it than men, which reveals that it's not actually negative sexism, but the byproduct of a general situation in which women have the greater privilege (that is, in the poster's theory, that people in general care more about keeping women happy than they do men, and it's only a manifestation of that).  That's absolutely neutral on the issue of whether it's right or wrong for people to tell other people to smile... it's just acknowledging why the chips fall as they do.  Annnnnd I have to say, if your point here is, ""People intruding into each others' business is annoying,"" then isn't it a bit hypocritical of you to try and enforce that position? I mean, by all means, lock and load, let people know your feelings if they spring it on you, but launching a preemptive strike against people who tell other people to smile is sort of answering asshole behavior with asshole behavior, isn't it?

TiADiscussion,38tau6,LDM123,91,Sat Jun 6 17:07:21 2015 UTC,"The reason SJW get so angry at the 'not all men' line is because they feel redirecting the conversation is a tactic to avoid having the conversation. (Ex. ""The sky is blue today. Lets talk about how blue it is!"" ""The sky isn't always blue."" ""But the sky is blue today! Why are you changing the subject????"") Some take it to the extreme of flat out rejecting the statement, but most just think of it as an intentional subject change to avoid discussing the real issue. What they really want is someone to listen to them and allow them to rant, rather than cast around trying to fix things (ie Safe Spaces).  I think of it as a 'It's not the Nail' problem.  The hypocrisy you mentioned has become increasingly relevant in the SJW brand of Feminism, and has a few sources:   Feminists disagree on everything. For every '#killallmen' Feminist you meet, there are 20 saying 'If you're a sex-positive Feminist please kill yourself' or 'Transexclusionary Feminists should die' or 'White feminism is worse than Hitler'. There is a crap ton of infighting within the community, and it's hard to say all Feminists feel a certain way because in reality a lot of Feminists hate each other because of differences in belief. To say there's a central doctrine of Feminism right now is highly misleading. Asking a Feminist who doesn't hate men 'why do Feminists hate men?' is akin to asking a non-racist White person 'why do White people hate Black people?'. Just because they're part of the group that contains the crazies doesn't mean they prescribe to all the crazies beliefs, and it's hard for them to explain their reasoning. And there is a lot of crazy that is really unexplainable.  Many internet Feminists have little to no education on Feminism. It's easy to accept the 'Do you believe in equality? Then you're a Feminist!' line without having to do the research and learn about the differences and branches of Feminism, which are ever evolving as people circlejerk themselves into more stupid divisions (there has been some pretty fantastic mental gymnastics in the past five years or so). Even less know of the not so positive things Feminism has done in the past, or the not so positive beliefs sex-negative Fems have, for example. You'd have to dig a bit deeper to encounter these things, and most people don't do that. The platform they use stifles all debate and discussion. Tumblr is a shitty platform. For many reasons. You cannot have a private message chain longer than three. Replying to a post creates a new post and you no longer see any replies to the original post. Note counts denote both debate and support, no division. There's no way to read other's comments without going through posts individually or digging deep into the tags. The list goes on. It's really, really easy for things to spin out of control on Tumblr. If someone uses Tumblr as their primary source for Feminism, there's a 95% chance that they're seeing twisted, distorted views of what Feminism is about.    Here's some crazy. It's a sex negative fem writing about how sex positive feminists are the worst and the terms are meaningless because it's really the savior radical fems vs the evil liberal fems. The comments get into more of the stupid shit that goes on in the community."

Thus sex-positive feminists who say 'do what you wanna do with your sex life' are enabling sex abuses by letting people do what they want to do. No matter if you like it or consent to it or not, because it reflects upon the patriarchy it is evil and should be abolished or changed (BDSM is sex-negative's favorite ranting point).

This is why they insist on thoroughly debunked statistics when making talking points, because while x amount of people will be able to see through the bullshit, there'll be a few whose amygdala takes over and starts going down the Feminist rabbit hole.   Whenever you say something that directly confronts this narrative, you're telling the emperor that he has no clothes. These Feminists who you're talking about do not want a nuanced conversation, because nuance is the antithesis of how they operate. The same way racists don't want to hear that ""not all black people are criminals"", and how actual misogynists don't want to hear that ""not all women are backstabbing gold diggers"", radfems do not want to hear that not all men are evil, because their worldview intentionally and aggressively rejects introspection. It's simply not how how the memes that they live under propagate, so naturally they see this as a threat."
TiADiscussion,38tau6,ThrowAwayOleOleOle,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"Meme:       A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)  is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"".  A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.   The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα pronounced [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, ""imitated thing"", from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, ""to imitate"", from μῖμος mimos, ""mime"")  coined by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976)   as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.   Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.   A field of study called memetics  arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible.  Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings.  Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal.   Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he obviously welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that ""memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically""  and wanted to regard memes as ""physically residing in the brain"".  Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.  At the New Directors' Showcase 2013 in Cannes, Dawkins' opinion on memetics was deliberately ambiguous.

Here’s the thing: when I respond to someone who goes out of their way to address me, I extend the same degree of benefit of doubt that is extended to me. I’m not going to spend my energy to jump to the defensive to humor someone telling me they already explained why my analogy is faulty when they openly admit that they can only even “guess” what the fuck it is in the first place. If you want me to extend that level of courtesy to you to spend my time explaining myself to you, I expect you to extend it to me first, not to act like your bare assertions alone are all it takes to obligate me to hop up to explain myself to you (or else your assertions stand). If I was playing your rhetorical game, I’d say you thinking that you demonstrating that you don’t know what the point was equals “the validity of my claim being challenged” is exactly the kind of BS you see on tumblr. You taking your ignorance of my statement’s meaning and asserting it as fact and then expecting that I’m going to think I’m obligated to hop up and defend myself to you, –or else– your –assertions– about what –I– mean stand ≠ my statement’s validity being challenged. The “Did you really…?” of your opening comment doesn’t really look that much different in practice from “I can’t even….”   “ … irrelevant … ”    You aren’t the arbiter of what’s valid and you aren’t the arbiter of what’s relevant. I decide what is relevant to me when I’m deciding what I’m going to say. The fact that you’re approaching me with the kind of shit attitude that sits back making assertions about what I mean when you can only even “guess” what my actual point was is relevant to me. I don’t respond with humor to people who approach me with that mindset, and as the owner of me, I have that right. Now, since you’re playing the back–and–forth downvote game (I assume, because I really doubt anyone else is paying such close attention to this), and you’re still not thinking “Hey, okay, maybe I should step back and ask what he means with a slight degree more respect that maybe I haven’t considered every conceivable way that statement could be cashed out into something that isn’t faulty,” (1) I’m done responding to you and (2) here’s your return downvote.

They know that it isn't all men that are responsible for the problem, but they feel like reminding them of it is derailing and distracting their conversation that is based on stereotypes.   It's like saying, in a conversation about ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Muslim terrorist groups, ""not all Muslims are terrorists"" vs. saying that ""not all Muslims are terrorists"" when they talk about how the religion of Islam itself or Muslims as a whole is/are terroristic. In the former, it's a true statement, but it's not directly related to the topic at hand. In the latter, it is absolutely relevant and should be said. Of course, if they say that ""men"" or ""all men"" are the problem then saying ""not all men"" is appropriate. But if they are talking about a small subset of men, then ""not all men"" doesn't make any sense."

Once again, it is factually true and I totally get that but it can get annoying if someone goes ""NOT ALL MEN"" though I completely understand why people say that because the feminists who hate this are usually the ones who overgeneralize.   Also, as another reason, they're fucking hypocrites who don't seem to understand that when you assume things about people, you make an ass out of you and me.   Yes, it's obnoxious and yes it can come off as someone trying to make it about them. But yet, it is factually true and overgeneralizing is something that should be frowned upon not celebrated."

If someone says ""Women have to deal with street harassment from men"", ""not all men"" is an asinine response to make.   When someone says ""men are pigs"", on the other hand, there is an implied ""all"" there and ""not all men"" is a valid response to the sexist comment.   The issue is that these people don't really try to figure these things out themselves. They look to smarter feminists that they trust. Those feminists point out how ""not all men"" is a stupid response in some situations, but their audience isn't smart enough to understand nuance. So they hear that as saying ""not all men"" is a stupid response, no matter what."

Not every feminist is going to be like Big Red or be like CHS(although I wish they were all like CHS).  It's because it's such a diverse group that you can't really claim that all of them are a certain way and be correct.

That's the thing: Different people affect the world through different modes of expression. Sometimes people use animated gifs and  groupthink mantras, and for all the damage that can do, at least it can do something to influence other ignorant people against actual sexism and racism. Sometimes people use psuedo-offensive satirical comments or overly-brutal honesty, and despite all the stiffs who don't understand it, it speaks to realists and cynics and prevents them from becoming complete nihilists. And, of course, sometimes people use pretension and art to communicate, and the great majority of people are dismissive of that... but once again, it does speak to a certain segment of people who can legitimately use it to understand society.  I think part of this whole mess we're in at the moment is that, as information begins to distribute more evenly, people are a little too exposed to the modes of communication which don't suit them. Suddenly soccer moms are being exposed to shock jocks, rednecks are being exposed to college kids, poor black people are being exposed to high-concept art, and none of them speak the same languages.

Many of his videos do indeed raise good points, some are even pretty entertaining.  Though I do much prefer the videos in which he is calm and more matter of fact-ish, instead of screaming around like mad.  And I disagree that he ""invalidates"" himself because he rages sometimes or is insulting to people. Ridicule is a valid way of criticism and he's free to voice his opinion, as long as he also provides good arguments.

TiADiscussion,38uzlj,not_shadowbanned_yet,4,Sun Jun 7 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree on that. A well reasoned argument punctuated by an insult or some abrasive language is not suddenly invalid. Some people think that a fallacy automatically makes an argument invalid and that's not always true."

TiADiscussion,38uzlj,KFCNyanCat,3,Sun Jun 7 05:57:16 2015 UTC,"An example would be pointing out how their doublethink where they see, say, racism against one of their in-groups and claim that's unacceptable and then turn around and be racist against their out-groups and think that's perfectly acceptable. They're seeing the same thing happen but somehow concluding it's totally not the same when I do it. When you point out something like that and make fun of them in some way that's particularly insulting somehow they think the insult invalidates the whole observation being undeniably true."
TiADiscussion,38uzlj,Mouon,2,Sun Jun 7 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I'd have to hear the insult(s) first to judge, but my initial thought is this:   They did not grow up with their silly definition of racism. They grew up with the real one, ergo they made a conscious decision at some point in time to adopt that stance. The mere fact that they used to believe what you believe makes them think you're simply less learned than they are, and makes them immune to any argument you might provide.  My recommendation would be to point aspects of that out. Ask them if they've always believed in that definition and only that definition. Ask them how exactly the younger definition can be the only correct one. Most importantly, ask them why not just say 'institutional racism'? (Might it be because half of the reason to rewrite a definition is to kill the idea behind the old one? Isn't redefining words for political reasons a little...1984? Aren't they putting themselves in the company of mass murderers through sheer willingness to propagandize on that level? Which of their historical heroes pulled that kind of underhanded technique, rather than let their ideas speak for themselves?)"

I've argued with these people before to define ""institutional"" and show actual evidence of where it's going on but the only actual institutional racism one can find and use concrete evidence (not just say, pointing to disparities and saying that is good enough evidence) to prove that is happening these days is affirmative action and related quotas discriminating against mostly white and asian males."

TiADiscussion,38uzlj,republiccommando1138,3,Sun Jun 7 21:30:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. Here is an article about it. It's fairly graphic so heads up. http://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/2012/02/scratch-the-amazing-atheist-off-your-list-too/  I'm on mobile so I don't feel like putting the brackets around the link and stuff.
TiADiscussion,38uma7,LoudHydraulics,2,Sat Jun 6 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"I would suggest reverting to two separate scales for attraction to males/masculinity and attraction to females/femininity, because attraction doesn't always sum to a constant, i.e. being more attracted to males doesn't NECESSARILY mean one is less attracted to females. It would also better represent those people who are not truly asexual but experience sexual attraction so rarely that they might as well be.  I would say that a romantic orientation section would be valuable as well, because I'm not wholly convinced that romantic orientation not matching one's sexual orientation is purely a special snowflake thing. And I feel that the current handling of asexuals is kind of treating them as a ""special case"" rather than fitting them into some kind of unified system. The latest version of the chart seems to indicate that one can't consider themselves asexual unless they NEVER experience sexual attraction, though I feel there should be some ambiguity, just like there would be with regards to the gender one is attracted to. If a man is attracted almost exclusively to other men, but is occasionally attracted to women, there is some ambiguity whether they should call themselves gay or bisexual. Likewise, someone who has only experienced sexual attraction three times by the age of 35 wouldn't be asexual by the current chart's definition, though it wouldn't seem meaningful to assign them to the categories of straight, gay, or bi if sexual attraction plays a virtually insignificant role in their life. I would say something like this would be the best representation of the four basic orientations.  I would also suggest that attraction to sex and attraction to gender be possibly made into separate categories, since I've found people place different levels of emphasis on genitals and on gender expression when it comes to being attracted to people. However, there is only so much room on the chart to begin with, and ultimately if we break down everything into details we'll end up with something too awkward to use. What's important to remember is that any sort of verbal or graphical description of one's orientation or gender cannot tell us the whole picture, but merely allow us to form broad categories based on what they have in common. Person A and Person B may both be bisexual trans women, however that does not mean they both experience gender and sexuality in exactly the same way."
TiADiscussion,38uma7,uptotwentycharacters,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:01:39 2015 UTC,"being more attracted to males doesn't NECESSARILY mean one is less attracted to females.   I guess not, but I allways thought of that scale as a a ratio between the two either way. I mean, the only way a person can measure these values is in comparison to eachother either way. So I dont see how two scales measuring each sex would be a more accurate model. If, lets say Bob, places himself on the middle of the homo-scale, and in the middle of the hetero-scale, that would mean that he is in the middle of the asexuality sepctrum in addition to being bisexual, but what really defines the middle of the asexuality spectrum? How much sexual attraction should anyone feel, and what really is the maximum sexual attraction one could feel? Nobody can answer these questions and therefore this placement on the hetero and homo scale doesnt give us that much information, after all we dont have use anything to measure this, (like boners/hour, lol). The only thing we can pull out of Bobs two scales is the ratio between the two scales, and whether or not he personally think he almost never feel sexual attraction. Thats about the only facts we can distinguish the difference between.   And I feel that the current handling of asexuals is kind of treating them as a ""special case"" rather than fitting them into some kind of unified system. The latest version of the chart seems to indicate that one can't consider themselves asexual unless they NEVER experience sexual attraction   And I think the reasoning behind that is the same as in the last paragraph. Nobody on the asexual spectrum wouldnt notice a difference nor need a place on a scale unless they are on completely or almost asexual, and in that case they wouldnt need a orientation. So I really liked the no orientation=asexual thing, its more of a yes or no thing, even though the attraction might happen for some of these people.   it wouldn't seem meaningful to assign them to the categories of straight, gay, or bi if sexual attraction plays a virtually insignificant role in their life. I would say something like this would be the best representation of the four basic orientations.   I dont see how you'd prefer this. This 2x2 table is a lot less inclusive than mine, and gives the impression that you are asexual if you're only under-averagely attracted to people."

Maybe you feel like a man most of the time, but occasionally you have feminine desires or feelings, or personality traits. Why does everything have to be fucking labeled?"

Also, reddit's sorting algorithms mean you are more likely to see a highly upvoted post than one that gets less upvotes. What gets the most upvotes in TIA? The most outrageous shit. So the whole subreddit is in its natural state a hysterical frenzy of SJW bullshit, giving you a grossly exaggerated picture of how prevalent this stuff is.  So I would advise you to unsub for a while. From TIA, from TIAD, and from TumblrAtRest. All of it. Set a reminder to resub in your calendar for two months from now if you're worried about your daily dose of outrage. And then unsub, and smell the roses. Note how your daily intake of bullshit goes way down.  This whole mess is a problem, but it's not the full-on cultural assault that it seems like if you're soaking in a tub of it."

TiADiscussion,38pycg,Uioppa,9,Sat Jun 6 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"I did exactly this a couple years ago, but it was unfollowing all the SJW blogs I followed on Tumblr instead of unsubscribing from subreddits. The nonstop righteous anger had become more exhausting than satisfying, so I decided to take a break in order to bring some positivity into my life again. And I'm really, really happy I took that break because it helped put a lot of the bullshit I'd internalized as an SJW into perspective. It only took a couple of months for my self-esteem to skyrocket back to where it was before I got sucked into radical feminism, and it was incredibly relieving to be able to focus on my own life instead of getting angry about all the injustices happening in the world.  Seriously, right now is probably the best possible time for you to take a break from everything. I realized that not everything is sexist/racist/homophobic/etc., so maybe you'll realize that the SJWs aren't actually as prevalent as you think they are and that the world isn't going to become a 1984-esque dystopia."

TiADiscussion,38pycg,Uioppa,8,Sun Jun 7 09:37:50 2015 UTC,"This turned out to be a lot longer than I thought it would be, sorry! D:  tl;dr: My time as an SJW was by far the worst period of my life. I got into it because I was an insecure 14-year-old, and I got out because I was sick of everyone being so angry and pessimistic about everything. Being in an overly negative environment warps your view of the world, so please take the time to analyze whether or not the communities you are part of make you happy.  I got a Tumblr when I was about 13, but I didn't get into social justice stuff until about a year later. I was at a really vulnerable time of my life when I discovered radical feminism - I'd just realized I was a lesbian, I had very few friends, and I was suffering through my first onset of depression. I basically had no self-esteem to speak of, so an ideology that put me on a pedistal for the things I was insecure about was a dream come true. I could blame all my problems on the ""heteropatriarchy"" (I wish I was making that up...) and just wait for the world to change to accommodate my minority status.  Because I was pretty much the definition of an impressionable teenager and I spent almost all of my free time on Tumblr, I internalized a lot of really harmful ideas (many of which I'm still trying to unlearn) without even realizing it. The world was black and white, or more accurately, ""progressive"" or ""problematic."" There was no room for nuanced discussion or compromise, only revering something as perfect or tearing it apart in a fit of righteous anger.   This way of thinking was easy at first because I was young and had very few world experiences, but it became progressively harder and harder to immediately stop liking things once they became ""problematic"" - especially when it came to people. According to Tumblr, ""problematic"" people weren't trustworthy and should be cut out of my life as soon as possible. I was already isolated because of how shy and socially awkward I was, and the list of people I felt I was morally allowed to like grew smaller by the day. But the problem was that even if I felt like I shouldn't like someone, I couldn't change the fact that I did. I still loved my family, friends, and teachers even though they couldn't meet my impossibly high standard of political correctness, and this filled me with shame. Activism had become part of my identity, so it was humiliating to feel like I had failed at it.  I hated myself for being a bad activist, but I also hated myself for being part of a few majority groups, since I believed that majorities were inherently ""worse"" than minorities. As much as people on Tumblr like to say otherwise, the Oppression Olympics is a very real and a very dangerous phenomenon. The worst thing you can be is privileged according to Tumblr, so even though I was gay and female, I was still told I was personally responsible for racism and transphobia because I'm white and cis. And deep down, I actually wanted to experience a trauma so I could claim the right to call myself an abuse victim.   Let that sink in: I, an emotionally vulnerable 14-15 year old kid, wanted to be abused so I could impress people I didn't even know on the Internet. I was so lonely and I hated myself so much for being privileged that I thought something terrible needed to happen to me in order for this fucking piece of shit community to accept me.   I grew more and more bitter and withdrawn, and it eventually led to an official diagnosis of dysthymia (which made me happy because it meant I could now call myself ""mentally ill""). Things continued as normal for a while, but once the depression started to lift, being offended and enraged by everything became more exhausting than satisfying. I started to realize that a lot of what offended everyone was fucking stupid, and that regular people belonging to majority groups were not personally responsible for all of the world's problems. I unfollowed a lot of people, blacklisted everything to do with social justice, and decided to just focus on making myself happy for a while.  And it turns out that my life is pretty fucking great. I have a fantastic family, friends who care about me more than I realized, and there are so many good things about myself that I overlooked in my perpetual angst. I grew more in those couple months away from Tumblr than I had in my whole 2.5 years as an SJW, and I regret so much that I didn't spend those years taking advantage of what life had to offer. Now I'm back on Tumblr, but as an anime/humor blogger rather than an SJ one.  Basically, my advice for /u/MedievalTortoise is to really examine what you get out of participating in the TiA/TiAD communities. I'm not saying that I think these subreddits are bad or anything like that, but I know from experience how damaging it can be to surround yourself with nonstop negativity. If worrying about SJWs is stressing you out this much, it might be a good idea to take a little break and distance yourself from all this stuff. Then if you decide to go back after a while, you might be able to approach things from a better state of mind."

My wife pointed out to me the other night that when I start reading all of the stories about fucked up things that the evil feminists do and watch videos of groups of them screaming at people in the streets and pulling fire alarms, I get pissed off. That made me realize that it just isn't worth it. These nutjobs (on both sides) are a very vocal minority of extremely negative, extremely unhappy people. I decided to not waste my time focusing on whatever the current mouthpiece is outraged over and I've been much happier because of it.  I'm glad that everything worked out well for you. Not everyone has the common sense and self reliance to pull themselves out of the cult of self inflicted misery."

TiADiscussion,38pycg,Ivanpilgrim,0,Sun Jun 21 10:16:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is not a proper question to pose to you specifically, it's just that I really appreciated the way in which you phrased your question, so I wanted to ask:  Would you happen to know a subreddit sort of in the middle of the two extremes? I've searched but I can't find one. I sort of levitate between srs and tia because both feature stuff that is legitimately crazy in their opponents view, and stuff that seem like legitimate grievances and or/ points of ignorance and lack of empathy. Ironically it's for the same reason; when srs is making sense it's because they're reblgging crazy people on the radical, deluded right, when tia is making sense it's because they're reblgging crazy people in the radical, deludes left. TiADiscussion levels that out to an extent, but there is still plenty of bonkers posting (in my personal opinion more so in the right column)"

If you're on TiA and here you're likely exposed to more of their rhetoric than most people, so you're likely to notice it more.  Take a deep breath, not everyone's like that.  We don't need to prove the virtues of egalitarianism, of freedom and the right to be offended, and to be happy, those things have proven themselves time and again, and I believe they're the right virtues we need in order to have a brighter future.  Also SJW's will tear into each other just as much as they will at anyone else.   SJW's are anti-intellectual too, do you remember the 'Protein World' debacle? Where's that now? I'll tell you where, lining Protein Worlds pockets, and most SJW's are of complaining about Caitlyn Jenner or some other bull crap.  People hate feminists, they hate SJW's and there are a tonne of people fighting back against them, and trust me soon, the feminists and SJW's will fuck up badly and those blogging and vlogging about them will be all over it.

TiADiscussion,38pycg,The_Donaven,10,Fri Jun 5 22:52:47 2015 UTC,"No it's Ok, I'm with you now.  Well I'm in Britain and we just had the whole Goldsmiths university / Bahar Mustafa fiasco here.  The thing about people like Bahar Mustafa or Saida Grundy, is that they have managed to find a university or organisation that supports them, whilst the wider community denounces them, meaning it's usually a toxic atmosphere within a university, not that the entire country or area supports them.  More people actually signed the change.org petition to remove Bahar Mustafa than they did to support her, unfortunately the decision lay with the university where she's 'diversity' officer, so she managed to keep her job, even though most people in Britain would gladly see her lynched.  When you're young, at school or university you're still impressionable, I was very liberal and ill informed as a teen and into my early twenties too, a lot of people are, but a lot of people grow up and grow out of it, and even if they broadly believe in certain things, they're not so moronic about it.  We in the anti-SJW community can be just as guilty of blowing things out of proportion too, or thinking everything said that even sounds remotely SJW like must be wrong and bad, so again, the atmosphere in places like Europe and the US can be just as much something that's being over-exaggerated too.  I still believe in equality, in welfare and universal healthcare, but I'm not like some angry Marxist though.  In the long run though politics are always changing, things go in and out of fashion, so yes, today things may appear to be going feminazis and SJW's way but that's not always going to be the case, my analogy about the Nazi party was to demonstrate to you and others that just because everyone else is turning crazy or becoming overly zealous bigots we don't have to, we can make a difference too, even if we're in the minority.  Going back to what I said regarding Britain in WWII standing up to the Nazi's, remember whilst Britain seemed to be standing alone, we did find allies, in your own country, the US, and in the former USSR (maybe not the best ally though, that last one), and we were able to grind the third Reich to a halt, and now people only remember the Nazi party with disdain and sometimes even as comic parodies.  This is what will happen to the SJW's maybe not so violently, but they'll continue to overstep the mark and people will continue to walk away from them, we'll continue to mock them, they'll eventually be discarded to the trash bin of history like all other bigots and racists.   In Europe like the US most people don't even know about 'inter-sectional feminism', the patriarchy or Marxist-anarchists.  I have a mate, she's in her early 20's not especially well educated, and if I had her here now and I asked her if she knew what these things are or asked if she knew about tumblrina's etc, she'd probably just keep shaking her head wondering what the hell I'm going on about, like a lot of my friends.  All she wants to do is, earn some money, get high on the weekend and have a laugh with her mates, and I think there's a lot to be said for that, and I think most people are like this, feminazi's can say what they want, institute whatever they want, that doesn't mean that people will give a damn.  I'd say to you enjoy your leisure time, have a laugh and take time away from TiA, play some video games, hang out with your friends.  If you want to actually work against SJW's go to College (Uni) out of SF if you can, get a good a career, maybe in law if you're not at Uni yet, and volunteer with the poor if you can. Never lose your friends that aren't as fortunate, or not as 'smart' and enjoy life.  That's my plan anyway.  I don't want this to become overly Tl;dr, or go over every countries stupid laws, just wanted to give you a general idea of what most people are really like 'on the ground' so to speak."

It's just that, I'm a person with a really dark sense of humor but at the end of the day knows it's all a joke.

TiADiscussion,38pycg,auandi,5,Fri Jun 5 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Protein World is a company that makes those protein shakes that body builders and gym bunnies drink, basically the company ran an ad campaign on the London Underground, with a attractive fit girl.  Well of course the SJW's went crazy because the ads tag line was 'are you beach body ready?', so fresh off their success in guilting a bleach company (Clorex bleach), they decided to twitter bomb Protein World, their CEO decided to take the piss out of them, it was pretty funny to be honest, the feminists aren't used to people biting back.   Really I should have expanded on my anti-intellectual comment, sorry.  The feminist remarks about the ad were all about 'why can't fat people be fit too' etc etc.  Suggesting being overweight and fit is healthy is clearly wrong, I'm overweight, but I'm dieting and at the gym etc, but I'm not healthy really, but love the support I get from my GP and I think I'm doing well, SJW's want to stop people being healthy, despite science saying being healthy is a good thing, and of course a slimming product is not necessarily marketed at everyone.  This is anti-science, and of course anti-intellectual.  I also meant that feminists, tumblrinas and SJW's have short memories, they forget this weeks 'big campaign' and move on to the next thing really quickly."

TiADiscussion,38pycg,Guomindang,7,Sat Jun 6 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Of course social justice will become the dominant ideology. Why are all the comments here in denial?  Social justice is a militant ideology present in virtually every university, where there exists an academic empire devoted to marinating the best and brightest minds in ""radical"" politics. Its recruits become the next generation of the cognitive elite, using their careers in the information apparatus to spread their ideology to the lower classes, causing public opinion to shift further over time. Already, some of their once crazy ideas have leaked into the liberal consensus.  Social justice will succeed because it is a social lubricant. In the cities of the ruling class, there is no social circle in which professing a love of humanity and hatred of oppression will earn you anything but respect and status. In any country in any era, one's opinions tend to align with one's self-interest. If you're an ambitious, intelligent, wealthy, young Brahmin, what better way to signal your membership in the cognitive elite than by demonstrating your familiarity with the latest intellectual fashions? Social justice has always been radical chic.  Social justice will succeed because it provides the sensation of power. There are few pleasures as primal as ganging up to destroy your enemies, further amplified by righteous justification.  Social justice will succeed because it is an adaptive mutation of our present beliefs. Over the past two centuries, anti-racism, anti-sexism, etc. have been elevated to the highest of virtues, yet the inequalities they seek to abolish still seem to persist. Clearly, a higher dosage is needed. Thus, the next generation of ""socially conscious"" citizens must be even more anti-racist, anti-sexist, etc. than the ones before. Social justice fills that demand.  Basically, social justice is the latest fashionable crusade to which all right-thinking people will flock to to signal their boundless generosity of opinion in pursuit of their class interests.  Why fight history? I, for one, am content to watch this madness take over the world. Then at least I can say, I told you so, you fscking fools."

By the end of the 90s it was rightly relegated to the butt of jokes and actively rejected by a populous sick of busybody know it all's speaking down to them. Even today there is a very powerful pushback that shows just how limited this movement is - the Chick-fil-a response showed this perfectly: the net result of the sjw demands for punishment were met by the public as an infringement and the company actually got more business as a result of the protests.   Gamergate and Metalgate showed the same thing: the moment these hipsters step out into the real world and attempt to subvert other people's subcultures and businesses, they are vehemently rejected by those groups now.   And the cycle will continue.   I can understand the OP's frustration, but the best advice is to simply take a break - switch off the computer, go out with some friends, have a beer or three and do the stuff that makes him happy.

They don't mind if someone is gay or some woman likes to focus on her career, but they will want a fit, pretty partner. When a bunch of pink hair fatties tell them that if they want to be called progressive they should find them sexy or else they are oppressing them with their patriarchical standards, they will not put up with that.  In other words, I expect a regression to the mean. As usual. Thankfully we will not hate gays or working women again. But we will not also accept oppression as an excuse for anything."

As SJWs increase in power and influence, the numbers of those immigrants flooding western countries increases. Who will they first go after when they have sufficient numbers and powers? Not the rest of us-- the social justice crowd. Anyone who is different, loud, and opinionated. Thus SJWS are destined to destroy themselves.

That's how the majority of society feels about SJWs, if they're even aware of their existence. Most of them won't even have heard of terms like 'cultural appropriation' and 'transmisogyny' unless they're in very specific environments (e.g. deep in that part of tumblr, or part of a politically-minded social group in academia). Sure there are a few cases that have made big headlines, like Mattress Girl, but so are there on the side of the right-wing loons, like that guy from 19 Kids - I could pull up a hundred posts from other subs that 'prove' conspiracies from every side of the political and religious spectrum, it's just that these are the ones we focus on here.  It's really important to keep into perspective how the people featured here fit into the bigger picture of society.

An example being the assumption that something is wrong with a guy who claims a woman raped him, since guys are supposed to just naturally want to fuck anything he gets his hands on."

Just because a person is venting, doesn't mean the things they say don't carry racist undertones, but at the same time it is a bit different than unprovoked racism.  It's still racist, but not necessarily a racism that springs from an everburning pit of hatred.  My parents for example, are a part of the ""not all X"" sort of racists, which is where people who vent in such a manner fall.  They have bad experiences with people from group x, whether it's white, black, mexican, what-have-you and end up falling back on stereotypes and group judgments.  For example if mexicans are lazy it's because they're mexican, if blacks are criminals it's because they're black, and if whites are racist it's because they're white.  They don't necessarily just judge a Mexican to be lazy because they're a Mexican, but if they end up conforming to that it suddenly turns into a racial thing.  Thus, when they end up venting about that lazy person who fucked up or didn't do x right (in my parents case, the people who built their house) it's aimed at the group they're a part of.  Similar things happen when it comes to venting against people who are democrats, republicans, liberals, conservatives, all sorts of groups many people have a tendency to, especially when exasperated, make quick group judgments rather than taking the time and effort for individual and nuanced ones.  Again, that's not to say that sort of venting is right, but it is pretty common even among those without full on hatred for the group they're venting against, and happen against nearly all groups.  Then there's the ""it's a joke"" approach.  I can't really say anything on that better than /u/Lulu_and_Tia did so I'll just steal quote them on it: ""But if I had to say, it's Tumblr/Twitter idiots attempting to dodge controversy in the most blatantly OBVIOUS way possible a deconstruction of humor where there is no timing, no subversion of expectation, etc...just declarative statements. It's funny in the same way the news is funny.""  As far as a joke goes, it fails completely just like the attempts at ""ironic"" misandry.  The motivation can come from several places, perhaps a hope to parody the extremists that people think they are, but in the end that it fails as it tends lack any actual subtlety necessary to be clearly sarcastic/tongue-in-cheek.  They insert it alongside statements they honestly believe and regularly espouse, and on the internet context is the only way to decipher sarcasm.  So when they deprive it of the clearly sarcastic context it doesn't come across as such.  There's no tone of voice to hear any sort of switch between the normal statement and #killallwhitemen.  And the final group, and the big reason the first two excuses for using it fall flat on their face, is that it's simply something actual racists would say.  And yes, racism against white people is a real thing.  You can look at South Africa to see the hatred pointed towards them, but if you know where to look you'll find plenty of it even in the US.  There are parts of the Black Panther (and/only(?) the new one?  I get the two mixed up...) and Nation of Islam that are insanely racist.  As well as Black Israelites (they're a new one to me, and one I don't know much about either).  There at least those among these groups who honestly preach, and in the case of the Black Panther Party(ies) have actually participated in horrible violence towards white people.  There are those who, while maybe not going so far as to personally be interesting in #killingallwhitepeople, would still be perfectly alright and supportive of it happening.  People who would consider it an improvement to the world.    And in the end, saying something an actual racist would say tends to make you look racist, unless the context points otherwise (and even then many will try to strip it of context to make it racist if they don't like you).  But when you racially group whites as racists, or mexicans as lazy, even if venting you're still just repeating that racist sentiment.  Maybe you don't actually treat all of that group like that, perhaps you're perfectly friendly with most of those you meet from that group, but it's impossible for everyone to know that about you and so for those who simply hear that ""venting"" you absolutely sound just like a full on racist.  The same goes for the poor usage as a joke.  When you fail to create the proper context for it to appear as a joke, then it doesn't appear as a joke.  It's easily possible to make ""racist"" jokes such as those built on stereotypes, but ""black people like watermelon"" isn't that.  It's just a statement, like Lulu said.  If it has none of the things that make a joke a joke, then it's not a joke."

This woman infuriates me more now, and I didn't think that was possible. Excuse the TMI rant I just typed below.   I've been sexually assaulted. One Tuesday afternoon, my senior year of college. I was drinking at my usual bar. M, a guy who's about 30 is in there. He's had one beer and one shot, I'm shitfaced. He's a school psychologist. He asked me to help him with something in his car. He told the bartender we were going to another bar around the corner.  Instead, he holds me down and makes me give him a blowjob and leaves bruises on my neck, fingers me, I don't think we had sex, but I'm not sure. The last thing I remember is being in his car and starting to scream. It was November and still light out. The next thing I remember, I'm on the floor of the bathroom and it's 11 at night. This happened in fall 2013. I met my boyfriend in the same bar two months later. I still see M. He's a regular. He tries to carry on conversation with me, gives me hugs, asks about my boyfriend. He's getting married in two weeks. I'm not scared of him, but I'm still a little traumatized. My boyfriend knows he can't hold my head if I'm going down on him. The Game of Thrones scene from a couple of weeks ago upset me. I sometimes have nightmares. The fact that Emma has made a porno reenacting the event that ""traumatized"" her so badly infuriates me. I can't even imagine how it makes women (or men) who were hurt far worse than I was feel?"
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,callievic,14,Sun Jun 7 14:49:52 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. What a horrible thing to happen.   This is pretty much my view on the matter. WHY did the media make her the spokesperson for rape victims? I hate everything right now.
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,22,Fri Jun 5 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just chalked it up to experience, mostly, and was thankful it wasn't any worse. My boyfriend wonders if he offered me a Xanax or something, based on how long I was blacked out.  It's frustrating that, between Emma and Jackie, rape victims have been so discredited. On the other side, I went to high school with a guy who went to jail over false rape accusations. He was a senior, 17, sleeping with a freshman, 15. Her brother caught them, and she cried rape.  Just like a man using his physical strength as an instrument of power, women can weaponize their vulnerability in an equally dangerous way. When either of those things happen, no one wins.  I'm with you. I hate everything."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,callievic,4,Fri Jun 5 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'm thankful you can handle it so well. I suspect he drugged you. Not cool. And illegal. But hard to prove. I don't even know you or him and I wish him ill.   Oh, that's terrible if your friend went to jail for consensual sex. Is that a false accusation? Or did he run afoul of the statutory rape law?  A weird thing happened to me the other night. I was watching 'Meatballs' on TV and thinking 'oh, I love this movie I have to show it to my kids!' Immediately then there is this scene where Bill Murray virtually attacks the counselor he is romantically interested in. He pins her to the couch. It's not a rape scene but I was thinking 'wow, times have really changed.' And I was also thinking that it really would be unpleasant to have to put up with men physically pinning you down on a  couch and grinding into you and then making it a joke. Women adapted to this and reduced their expectations of what they could demand of men. So only penetrative rape counted.    Note: I love Bill Murray. It's still funny and a great movie and she likes him. It's not rape. My point is only that if men think twice before they physically grab you and 'joke rape' you--is that a bad thing? I don't think so.   I don't think we should live in a world where men get to grab women and get sexual enjoyment from them using coercion and the women just kind of have to go along with it and then suffer the horrible consequences. I think that is the world we live in though--maybe we cannot do so much about it but I can't blame people for trying to do something.   If you have a daughter and you imagine that happening to her then it's hard to think we should not try to seek more protection for women. That's partly what motivates me--my kids."

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,NaturalisticPhallacy,3,Fri Jun 5 11:47:42 2015 UTC,"So she names it ""This is not rape"", and in reality it was staged, consensual, and literally not rape.  This is what we call in the BDSM community 'consensual non-consent' when you want to differentiate between actual rape and consensual rape-play, with a side of exhibitionism thrown in.  It's literally not rape.  I can't believe she did this. Holy shit. I thought when she graduated and was no longer able to carry the mattress around that we'd heard the last of her.  I honestly think if she'd just find a knowledgable dom to consensually-non-consent her when she's feeling the urge, she'd be mentally way more stable and could maybe stop being an attention whore.  Well, at least I've seen her sucking a dick now. So I've got that going for me, which is nice."

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Karmaze,-38,Sat Jun 6 11:10:15 2015 UTC,You can't prove it never happened. You can only prove she can't prove it.   It's sort of a new issue--what do you do if someone accuses someone else of harming them but the other person is exonerated?   I think strictly speaking you can't claim certain things about them because of laws against defamation. But art somehow would get around this.   I like the way you say 'it's getting out of hands.' It's so out of hand that it's actually getting out of hands.   I would agree with this statement.

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,-14,Fri Jun 5 09:24:10 2015 UTC,Burden of proof in a legal proceeding is exactly what I'm talking about--that's settled. There were no criminal proceedings.  It goes the other way too believe it or not. A person can actually be convicted of a crime and so it is proved and yet the person is not guilty of the crime. Amazing fact but a legal process does not infallibly determine the truth of actual events in the world.
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Handsome_Hunk,22,Fri Jun 5 09:29:21 2015 UTC,"It's up to you who you want to give the benefit of the doubt. The person making an allegation or the person denying it. It obviously isn't as simple as that, and you can consider motives, character, etc. You can consider what you're going to do with your beliefs, what other beliefs they'll lead to, what biases lead to them.   Emma seems to want us to listen and believe alleged victims, full stop. That doesn't seem very adult.   Edit for nuance: obviously, you don't have to give all the benefit of the doubt to either party. You don't have to choose unless you're on a jury, and there's reasons why juries use burdens of proof rather than simply being polled for their belief about who did what. A belief in a vacuum matters little. When it informs your actions and worldview, then it does, and how much and why you believe something are probably valuable to consider if you intend to avoid acting on false premises."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,19,Fri Jun 5 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Emma seems to want us to listen and believe alleged victims, full stop. That doesn't seem very adult.    It's very dangerous."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Handsome_Hunk,-7,Fri Jun 5 12:32:36 2015 UTC,"Emma seems to want us to listen and believe alleged victims, full stop. That doesn't seem very adult.   But statistically speaking, if you buy into the 2-8% false rape accusation rate statistic (which virtually everyone who supports her does), the alleged victim is most likely right and so you should believe her.  This is what I posted from an earlier thread on why people believe her:   From what I can tell, the reason why people are quick to believe her is because they buy into the ""women rarely false-accuse"" statistic, in which only 2-8% of women falsely accuse their victims. That means, that if 3 women accuse him of rape, there is less than 0.1% chance that all of these accusations are false. Even if we were to go by the MRA's ~40% false accusation rate, there would only still be 6.4% chance that they were all lying, assuming statistical independence. That, combined with the hysteria over rape on college campuses, makes the reaction swift and sure in favor of Sulkowicz. If there is any dissent, they will point out the amount of shaming and harrassment that accusers, many of whom are correct, go through (in my opinion, in no small part BECAUSE of high-profile false accusations), and say that ""it's not worth it to falsely accuse"", when in some select cases, it would be worth it if you could get away with it.   Also, you SHOULD at least listen to alleged victims, because every case should be taken seriously and investigated. Whether you believe them or not should be based on what proof is given.  Edit: What's up with all the downvoting of people who think that we're saying she's right? u/iamyo and I are just saying that we can't definitively prove that she was wrong, either."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,13,Fri Jun 5 12:35:32 2015 UTC,"I think the big problem, even if you accept the 2-8% false accuse rate what that even means. We're talking strictly cases that get picked up by the police. So this leaves out all the cases that are handled privately, for example by schools or through social pressure.   Like this case, I believe.   The % for cases where the primary vector is private discipline or social pressure is most definitely significantly higher."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Handsome_Hunk,2,Fri Jun 5 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"It's also only a baseline percentage at best. If 5% of accusations are false (going with the middle of 2-8%) then without any other information about the case, you'd assume that an accusation has about a 5% chance of being false and 95% chance of being true. But when more information comes in, you adjust that particular accusation's odds up or down with the evidence. Evidence of the accused person's innocence means that accusation has a much more than 5% chance of being bogus (and evidence for guilt makes it less than 5%), even if the total nationwide percentages stay about the same."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,NaturalisticPhallacy,-2,Fri Jun 5 13:07:37 2015 UTC,"Probably, since only cases with a lot of proof tend to go to the police. That's why I'm inclined to believe, say, the girl who reported Jameis Winston, but not Emma. But given that rapes are, according to most sexual violence victim advocates, heavily underreported, feminists have tried to explain that by saying that people who DO speak out get harassed, get told they were ""asking for it"", and have their credibility challenged at every turn, which ""makes the hassle not worth it"", contributing to the underreporting.   I remember this past year when 4 of my college's students went on trial for rape. They were convicted, because they actually took a video of the incident and so there was incontrovertible proof that it happened. The amount of harassment that the girl got was insane, not from the school but from outsiders. People on various internet forums said she was ""lying, just like the others"", ""attention-seeking"", ""asking for it"", and called her ""the girl that ratted"". The prosecutor said she was ""one of the bravest people [he's] ever met"" for coming forward despite all the opposition. Ironically though, the girl refused to release her name to the press, and insisted on staying anonymous, because it would seem attention-seeking and self-serving to make a martyr out of herself. The school rallied to support her though, and most of the school changed their profile picture to ""I am the girl that ratted"" and had discussions on college rape to support her.  I'm honestly not sure what to think here, between statistics, my own experiences, and what Emma is doing. I don't exactly trust her because she has a motive to lie, but to say flat out she's lying is a bit too strong."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,6,Fri Jun 5 13:50:48 2015 UTC,For what it's worth I don't think she's lying. I think the most likely explanation is that her memories were altered based upon pressures that she saw in the media and the culture. Memories are pretty malleable things.

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,LegoBomb,14,Fri Jun 5 15:09:49 2015 UTC,"This gets to me on so many levels.   I'm not saying she has to be the perfect victim as in: everything has to be credible. But she is both making herself a stand in for victims and then making it all about her at the same time. She's just destroyed the credibility of all victims so that she could launch her art career.   It used to be taken for granted that rape by any current or former sexual partner was not prosecutable in any way. My housemate was raped by her ex-boyfriend. Come home, her whole face is swollen. She was hobbling around in pain for days. She just sat there shellshocked, watching TV all night, stunned drinking, smoking, trying to cope. It dawned on me a whole day after the fact--oh, that's a crime. Rape is a crime. You could...call the police? I mention this option to her. She gives me a pitying look. Even then, I could imagine her talking to him again just because--people do that. And she was broken and afraid. It was forced rape as he beat her and told her that he would either continue to beat her or she could submit to rape. So she submitted. Her face was very swollen. She was a very tough person too.   Very few people reported rape and even when a rape happened no one cared. I accidentally came in on a friend of my friend having drunken sex with his girlfriend and she was verbally and physically resisting and I just closed the door quickly, embarrassed. It never even occurred me to help this woman yelling 'no, no get off me!'  You could say--he's her boyfriend. Or--they were drunk. There's diminished capacity so perhaps he is not as responsible. But I didn't even think to help her in the moment.  That's what it was like not too long ago. Unless physical evidence was left, a man would have to rape at least 3 women, they'd have to all come forward, their stories would all have to be totally consistent and then the man would be told he had to leave campus until the women graduated and afterward he would be free to come back.   It's not like there is some wonderful pay off for women who say they are raped. Shining a spotlight on rape lets people know what rape is, that they have rights, possibly makes it possible for them to get support.  For Emma, there appears to be a payoff, which is nauseating. It doesn't mean she wasn't raped but it destroys whatever value there is for others in the publicity she got.   There's this problem because it's always going to be a question of how proof is possible unless the victim does have the shit beaten out of them or there is a witness.   The default 'maybe the person is telling the truth' from women also comes from having been assaulted or having seen or known of such assaults.   The truth is that it is exceedingly difficult to run things in the other direction. And it will be a struggle to deal with these cases. But if you do express some kind of power for the victim, more women feel free to come forward and there is some deterrence value.  Emma has just demolished that.   She's also created a climate where people may seek to benefit from rape accusations, thus diminishing the power of future victims to be believed and putting innocent people in jeopardy of having their lives destroyed by false accusations.   Tl; dr I'm not a fan of Emma."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,7,Sat Jun 6 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"This is what a thoughtful analysis looks like.   I think very few disagree that rape is awful and prosecutions and consequences have historically been lacking.   In 2015, hell for quite a while now, pretty much since college aged people have been alive, the situation has markedly improved. People by and large recognize rape is awful, and that there is a lot of nuance to consent and so on. We as a culture are not shy about prosecuting, punishing, and inculcated in our youth how to get consent and not cross those lines.   I don't think we made that progress by insisting everyone believe allegations that don't have any evidence. I think we made that progress by being frank and encouraging empathy. I'll stop mansplaining."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,NaturalisticPhallacy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"I agree we cannot have a default 'believe any allegation no matter what.' But the witness is going to be the woman and the evidence if you have any is going to be some evidence of a sexual act. And there's not going to be be much else because a man can sexually attack a woman and she may not have the physical strength to stop him. So how do you solve that dilemma?   You can't say: Everyone knows to be nicer now, the end! Problem solved. No rapes here among all us nice people, move along!  That's bullshit. There's a lot of evidence women still get raped. If you want to be one of those people who say women always lie, even when anonymous research is being done then obviously there's no point in discussing things here.  You can't say: Believe anyone who says they are raped! No matter what! And then the rapist must be prosecuted on the word of the victim, always and he has to always lose! The end.   Then there would be a bunch of men accused and convicted who haven't done anything.   You can't say: Never believe the victim unless she's got a stab wound and the rapist fingerprints are on the knife!  That just gives people carte blanche to rape whomever they want.  Clearly, they AREN'T just believing every woman no matter what she says.  Rarely is the woman going to get her rape accusation believed just on her say so but it can happen.  If, as it appears to be the case, the vast majority of rapes are committed by a small number, then those people sometimes will find themselves facing multiple credible accusers.   An interesting bind (not the hugest issue) caused by the collision between the manosphere and the rape culture movement is that no one is every allowed to tell a woman to be super careful and watch herself. If you do--you're saying men are rapists! Ah! Evil feminist saying men are rapists! HOW DARE YOU! MEN DON'T RAPE! OR you can't say WOMEN have to be careful! HOW DARE YOU! IT'S ALL UP TO MEN NOT TO RAPE! Rape culture!!!  It sucks to be afraid and it's not going to help women because they are so often raped by someone they know and trust but they should understand they aren't safe.   But when women realize they aren't safe, they do get upset. And then we hate on them for talking about rape culture.   So women are terrible if they say 'I am at risk for rape in many situations in my life and there's not much I can do and they are terrible if they say 'I'd be safer if I knew for sure I could come forward and have my claims taken seriously.'    What's the option?   I'm not even saying there's an obvious answer I know. I'm just saying that there's a problem."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,5,Sat Jun 6 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"I think we should treat it like nearly every other allegation. Look at the evidence, statements of the witnesses (even if only two), and question them under penalty of perjury where appropriate.   It leaves some risk some rapists go free, like every other crime, sure.   We can also, as we have been for several decades, educate men about consent and communication. We can teach women the same. We can promote safety and respect, and how to preserve evidence when there are crimes.   We don't have to form camps and fight each other from ludicrous principles. We don't have to use bullshit statistics as propaganda. We don't have to muddy discussion of the issues with trigger warnings and special truth-privilege for those who claim victimhood. There are bad consequences and bad incentives for all of those."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Wylanderuk,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, overall I agree. But there are two issues (1) A conduct issue. (2) A crime.   Rapes should just get referred to the police and the idea that a university should be the one 'prosecuting' is a bad idea, clearly. However, sometimes a rape (or retaliation because one claims one is raped) could violate a campus code of conduct.  Then you need a conduct procedure.    You also have to hope the place where the rape or alleged rape takes place doesn't have an awful police force or lousy DA. This problem extends in a bunch of directions."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,2,Fri Jun 5 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"Sure. I'd hope that any official findings by a university use some reasonable standard evidence and have some protection for the accused, but sure.  And I don't think anyone supports police sweeping rapes under the rug. I'm not sure blasting questionable-at-best cases into national headlines as examples of that happening is a good tactic, though. If it is actually prevalent, I'd think illustrative instances would be easy to find, but apparently they're not. All the cases that make it to the media that aren't decades old seem to involve a victim who declined to go to the police in a timely fashion or really to do anything to preserve evidence, the cases often looking like miscommunication (which I think is a problem and we ought to educate people on how to be on the same page) rather than an attack, or simple vengeance with the rape made up of whole cloth.   I'm not aware of any case in the media where a person alleges they were raped, and actually went to the police with a bruise or injury or any evidence and been ignored. Basically all they can do is question the alleged assailant and verify what can be verified. I do not think there are a large number of women going to the cops immediately, with or without hard evidence, and being ignored. But after some months it begins to look like regret rather than rape and it is impossible to carry the burden of proof without a lucky confession from the perp."

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,2,Fri Jun 5 16:45:02 2015 UTC,Yes. OK--well then.  I'd say it's time to move on.

TiADiscussion,38mtlh,lifeonthegrid,-15,Fri Jun 5 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"But it's just a fact we can't prove it didn't happen simply because she contacted the accused or she's now acting bizarrely. It doesn't 'disprove' a rape that the person contacted the alleged rapist after the fact with some semi-romantic overture. If she was raped, it is unfortunate but she appears to have not done the things that would make her case easier to prosecute. So if he is exonerated then there's not much that can be done on her behalf.  I realize anecdotal evidence is not good but I know a huge number of women who were sexually assaulted without getting to the accusation point.  My mother. My sister. Most of my female friends. Some were attempted rapes, some were completed rapes. These are not 'she got drunk and didn't give consent.' Full on rapes with verbal and physical resistance by the woman. Only one accusation, no prosecutions of any kind. One woman tried to tell her group of friends, and they shunned her after that.  And it fucks people up very badly to be raped--some more than others."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,zerodeem,19,Fri Jun 5 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"Let's recap shall we?   There is no correct way for a rape victim to act which leads to whether or not they were raped. There is no wrong for a rape victim to act which leads to whether or not they were raped. Every rape, especially every one that gets debunked after any scrutiny of the facts totally happened because you believe proving a negative with the burden on the accused is the only way a rape didn't occur.   I apologize,  I simply can't support your inquisition."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,lifeonthegrid,5,Fri Jun 5 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"That's what I hate most about this whole thing. If she says she was raped, it is because she was raped.

Thank goodness that kind of thinking isn't accepted in a court of law."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,Karmaze,-2,Fri Jun 5 13:08:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think an internet news piece is going to prove or debunk a rape.   And no--I think she may screw up her legal case but a person can be raped and talk to the perpetrator afterward, even in a friendly way. There are a lot of reasons for this. First, she may be afraid of the rapist. Second, she may be afraid of losing social status. No one is going to make a rape victim the president of a sorority.   You have to separate out what is going to hurt you in a legal proceeding from how people might perceive what you did and whether you are telling the truth.   We can defend men from legal penalties and maybe even defend them from being publicly proclaimed as rapists and not say women are always lying. It can be done."

Luckily for him, she is doing things to destroy her credibility and make him look like a victim of defamation (by art--which might not be legally actionable).  Unluckily for rape victims she just took a bunch of important attention drawn to the real problem of rape and flushed it down the toilet, making it harder for them in the future."

And now you're just stating the obvious.  In my eyes, the debate is whether or not we should believe Emma just because she says she was raped. At that point, it becomes a battle of credibility between Paul and Emma, and with everything Emma has done wrong (e.g., waiting months after the alleged rape occurred to report it, etc.) paired with everything Paul has done right (e.g., honoring the confidentiality agreements, providing any kind of evidence whatsoever, etc.), her credibility is strained.   So if he is exonerated then...   If he is exonerated, then the issue should just die there. At that point, it's up to her to prove that the university mishandled her case, which is similar to what Paul's lawsuit is doing against the university now. He has done everything right so far. With all that, I have no reason to believe anything Emma is saying at all."
TiADiscussion,38mtlh,iamyo,0,Fri Jun 5 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"At this point, I can't defend Emma in particular.    Recently, she blew it for way more people than herself.  Unjustly, unfairly, wrongly, horribly. I hope I'm wrong but I worry whatever attention she brought to rape will undermine future rape victims.   I still think I need to defend the idea that just because someone in a small community tries to keep ties with their rapist or tries to forget it for a while--or whatever human thing they do--this does not disprove the rape happened.   Legally speaking though, they will have a tough time because the burden of proof is on the prosecution.   It's plausible that people would try to maintain social ties when they have been made to feel powerless and afraid. Anyone who looks at child abuse or child rape sees that. People can identify with their perpetrators to save face, they can think that it's the only way to stay safe in the future, they can think their humiliation will be erased if the perpetrator apologizes, they can still LIKE their rapist in some weird way, etc., etc. Emotions take time to catch up to events.  Rapists often target the people least likely to stand up for themselves.   That's all I'm trying to say. Look at male rapes, you see the same pattern of trying to pretend it didn't happen.

Tumblr often uses transmisogyny in place of transphobia because they don't like trans men.  Cissexism is the idea that cisgender people are better than trans people, i.e. they're ""real"" women and ""real"" men.

Members of the original Black Panther Party have insisted that the newer party is illegitimate and have firmly declared, ""There is no new Black Panther Party"".   The New Black Panther Party is currently led by Hashim Nzinga.  Malik Zulu Shabazz announced on an October 14, 2013 online radio broadcast that he was stepping down and that Nzinga, then national chief of staff, would replace him.  Chawn Kweli, who, initially, served as NBPP national spokesman replaced Nzinga as national chief of staff. Still, the NBPP upholds Khalid Abdul Muhammad as the de facto father of the movement. When former Nation of Islam (NOI) minister Khalid Abdul Muhammad became the national chairman of the NBPP from the late 1990s until his death in 2001, He, Shabazz, and many other, breakaway members of the NOI followed minister Muhammad to the NBPP during this period. Nzinga served as personal assistant to minister Muhammad.  In April 2010, Malik Zulu Shabazz appointed French Black leader Stellio Capo Chichi as the representative of the movement in France.  Capo Chichi has been holding the position of head of the francophone branch of NBPP.

He understood that we needed the capitalist profit motive to create tech at a fast enough rate, but thought eventually that tech could facilitate the socialist society. The conundrum is, luxury tech keeps growing at a faster rate than social/ecological tech, so that capitalist means-to-an-end is continually more attractive.

It's racist in the same way that going up to a black person and saying, ""I just want you to know, I support your people, my man!"" is racist. It's a non-sequitur. Contrary to people who misunderstand satire (like Sooey Park) or who see racial symbolism where it may not really exist, there's an argument to be made that this is actually racist because someone was so specifically trying to be racially-aware, but doing it cluelessly.  At the same time, though, playing someone of another race is not inherently racist; you have to figure, in a perfectly equal world, anyone could play any other race without it being insulting because there would be no stakes. In a perfectly equal world, race would be no different than hair color. Thus, the standard should be whether there's a specific intent to be socially-conscious---in which case, follow your own rules.

TiADiscussion,38loz9,taco_roco,2,Fri Jun 5 15:11:09 2015 UTC,"It's all about context I think. If some of the main characters from the His Dark Materials trilogy – just to pick something at random from my bookshelf – were played by non-white actors I'd be a little surprised, as it's not how they're described, but it's not unrealistic. I mean it's largely set in an alternate universe, you could even have 99% of middle-class British academics be dark-skinned there and it wouldn't break the story. On the other hand, if you take something like Trainspotting it wouldn't be ok to cast Rent Boy as an Asian, because the whole point of the book and film is that they're about a particular demographic (white working-class Scottish men).  Not to get all SJW-y myself, but I think the difference has to do with whiteness being seen as the default in our society. It's fairly rare (at least in the books I've read) to have a main character who's incidentally non-white: if the main character's black, say, it's because the story's either about their life in Africa/the Caribbean or their struggle with racism in our society. That means that if you have a non-white character in the source material and they're played by a white actor it's more likely to be like the Trainspotting example above – you're changing a key part of their character, backstory, whatever. If you have a white character then the creator probably (though not always) put less thought into their ethnicity so you're more likely to be able to change it without making things unrealistic."
TiADiscussion,38loz9,lifeonthegrid,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"I take more issue with the reasoning behind why this is okay: Systematic Oppression! Minorities! Victims!  I agree with them to a point: When a white actor takes over a role essentially designed for someone of a different colour (i.e. their colour was legitimately important to the role), it can be a problem. Even so, if the piece still does a decent job at representing the issue surrounding their race/culture, and the actor genuinely pulls off the role and respects the role they took in the first place, save the hate-jerk. Don't worry, you'll get your shot to explode on something else that deserves the criticism."
TiADiscussion,38loz9,CoMaBlaCK,3,Fri Jun 5 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of roles in Hollywood are for white people. Plenty of the ""any ethnicity"" roles are for white people as well. The few roles that are for minorities are frequently stereotypical and supporting roles. So when a non-stereotypical, non-supporting Asian character comes up and they cast a white person, it's depriving Asian actors of yet another opportunity to work."
TiADiscussion,38loz9,lifeonthegrid,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"But I think this applies more to something like a semitic race where the appearance can be fudged. Oscar Isaac has been playing a lot of characters with clearly different backgrounds---he's Arabic, but he's played Jewish and Latino roles---and it totally works because he's physically convincing, and the cultural identity of those characters has rarely been integral to the stories they were in (i.i. A Most Violent Year; he played a crook businessman named Abel Morales, but as he was sort of a rising upper-middle-class guy among a lot of Italian mobsters, being South American had very little to do with the character so nobody fussed about it).  EDIT: I was wrong about his descent---he's Guatemalan/Cuban---but that said, it works the other way around, as he's played middle-eastern roles too."

If the people making this movie cast Emma Stone for her star power but then changed the character she played to be a white person who just learns about Polynesian stuff, then that would make way more sense to me as a viewer than that she is Polynesian herself, because it's obvious she isn't.    Or are you of the thinking that white people need to be in less films?   No idea where you're getting that from.

Emma Stone doesn't look Chinese or Polynesian. There was no effort to make her look that way. That's what's different about this, versus every other example you're listing. It's dumb for her to play this role in the same way that it would have been dumb for Morgan Freeman to say, ""Top o' the morning to you, me lads!"" in the prison mess hall in Shawshank Redemption. It would have been dumb for Zoe Saldana to run around going, ""Look how blue I am!"" if there was no CGI and she was just this beautiful black girl in a loincloth. It would have been dumb for Johnny Depp to have worn a business suit to school in 21 Jump Street instead of his 80's burnout clothes.  The issue is not that it was attempted at all, but that it was attempted and, by the general consensus, failed to be convincing. There are still stakes---it's just that the stakes are not as high and the rules not as strict as a lot of whiners make them out to be. But on rare occasions, there are still failures by that standard, not because of some high moral expectation we're supposed to have, but simply because we should expect films to be remotely coherent."

Your solution is to literally yellowface Emma Stone?  The best anybody could come up with in regards to my examples is of course all of these minorities should play these roles because of various reasons but how dare white Emma Stone do the same because of reasons!  Where does it end? Should foreign actors not play American roles because they aren't American? Andrew Lincoln shouldn't play a southerner because in a show about the zombie apocalypse, that's what takes you out of the role?  All anybody can come up with is for whatever reason they believe white actors cannot make a living at their craft and literally any other race is excused from this, if that's your point just say so."

And yes, if they wanted Emma Stone to be half-Chinese, half-Polynesian, they would have had to ""yellowface"" her. Except... you're not allowed to do that anymore... so... what can you do then? Well, you can either change the role, or don't cast Emma Stone, because she doesn't qualify for the part, just as in most cases a woman doesn't qualify to play a character who is supposed to be male. You're paranoid---it has nothing to do with being a minority. A black woman can't play a white male character either.

Humor tends to be the domain of those like to poke fun at people who are powerful or think that they are powerful, and the progressive left has a long tradition, with George Carlin being the most prominent exponent, of using humor to get their views across.  We're already starting to see it with Cracked.com, Buzzfeed, and the Onion. It'll be quite likely that any website with a left-leaning audience that uses humor to get across their views will start turning their jokes on the patriarchy, institutionalized racism and those who defend it, ""privileged"" people, those who question the SJW viewpoint, and those who ""protect the status quo"". This will also be the case in live stand-up comedy, as demonstrated in the most recent White House Correspondent's Dinner.  Another likely place would be the gaming community. Even though for now Gamergate is in the past, the gaming community will never be the same again. With the large increase in females as gamers and increased media attention after the scandal, some of them will carry with them the expectation that they'll get incessantly harassed or doxxed like Zoe Quinn did, and so will become very hypersensitive as a result. Some of them may just have been feminists to begin with, and though that is not a bad thing, an SJW will very easily be able to tell a narrative of longstanding sexism against women in gaming to turn them into SJWs. Consequences of that may be women-only servers for multiplayer games/safe spaces, trying to see sexism in every aspect of gaming, and making threats to developers who don't conform to their will. Prominent feminists have already turned on the gaming industry as all of you know, but it's only a matter of time before they arrive in numbers as gamers who are SJWs."

Yeah The Onion seems to be getting more feminist, but none of the SJW articles that I've seen by any humor- based community are ever funny. Perhaps other people disagree, and perhaps I'm underestimating the capacity of SJW's to force themselves to find humor in their bigotry (DAE male tears? xD), but imo taking shock value out of comedy and turning it into some killjoy soapbox is a pretty easy way of making sure you go out of business."
TiADiscussion,38jqnh,fuckingliterally,0,Thu Jun 4 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"The Onion is becoming more than just feminist. The whole SJW narrative on race relations was expressed in the Onion after Ferguson and Baltimore, and there was some vicious satire of gun owners after Newtown.   They and Cracked.com aren't as funny as they used to be anymore, much of it because of their increasing reliance on SJW tropes for the source of their jokes. And yes, the SJW narrative has humor of its own, poking fun of institutionalized racism/sexism and ""privileged"" people.  A good example would be a real-life example: in the White House Correspondents' Dinner, the guest of honor, Cecily Strong, described Obama's hair as ""so white it could talk back to the police [without getting shot]"". Another joke on this topic was ""The Secret Service - the only law enforcement agency that will get in trouble if a black man gets shot."" Yet another joke was about abortion, in which she said ""I'm not going to tell you politicians how to do politics. It's like you telling me what to do with my body, right?"", and criticized the media for focusing on women's appearance, making them ""solemnly swear that [they] will not talk about Hillary's appearance"". So SJW humor does exist- it's all in the topics that they choose.  I can show you some Onion articles (you can find them in the thread here among my comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrAtRest/comments/38d5vq/vox_im_a_liberal_professor_and_my_liberal/) if you'd like to see what kind of stuff the Onion produces these days.  As for female gamers, they've certainly grown. Maybe not a lot of SJWs among them yet, but I have a sneaking suspicion that some SJWs might find the gaming community ripe for a cleaning-out, due to the large amount of perceived sexism in the community, and they don't have to work hard (as they would have to if they went into STEM or into any real positions of power; I have seen SJW engineering/science majors at my university but only because my university has a lot of really ambitious but also very left-wing people) to get the platform to spread their message."

But even though that proves that racism exists within police and justice systems in America, you are right in saying that the whole thing is unintentional and just a result of people making associations where they shouldn't, rather than a system designed to keep minorities down, as claimed by the SJWs. Now that I think about it, I was wrong in calling Cecily Strong's remarks on that topic SJW-ish, but the SJWs that I know who often claim that the whole system is designed to keep minorities down retweeted the hell out of gifs of that remark, which is why I associated it with SJWs.

People getting kicked out of cons for being a ""gator,"" as they are referred to as (look into the recent ""Honey Badger"" fiasco, where a group of female gamers were kicked out for being part of that misogynistic MRA gamer hate movement.)  If you're initiated on the whole SJW narrative - calling everyone you don't like a white male dudebro - it's interesting cause it appears that Gamergate is pretty diverse, both racially and sexually. What I'm noticing is that this is all one big fucking ball of yarn; this SJW thing that some people like to write off as some wacky elitist teens, it's actually spreading really far. There's a lot of websites and magazines that are falling in line, it's not a Tumblr thing.   I think the old wisdom was that people went along with it because there was money in it. Don't rock the boat, agree with the passionate people, it's not worth the headache. Now we're seeing people actually stand up, especially when they realize that these people... well, first there's not that many of them, and second they don't buy shit.

The SJWs were shockingly effective at defining the issue as mainly about harassment against them. You don't usually see this except sometimes with terrorists where the media will cover their tactics and ignore the motivation. Let's look at the intro from Wikipedia   The Gamergate controversy concerns sexism in video game culture. It garnered significant public attention after August 2014, when several women within the video game industry, including game developers Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu and feminist cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian, were subjected to a sustained campaign of misogynistic attacks.    Compare for Naziism    Nationalsozialismus), was the ideology and practice of the German Nazi Party and of Nazi Germany as a whole. Usually characterised as an offshoot of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and antisemitism, Nazism arose from pan-Germanism, the Völkisch German nationalist movement and the anti-communist Freikorps after World War I.   Edit: in case it isn't clear my point is that the gamergate one stays with a negative characteristic that they wouldn't agree with (sexism) and carries on with accusations over tactics.  The Naziism one is much more neutral and informative about their actual motivation."

I mean, the west had a labor deficit pretty much until the big push to get women into the labor force. Coincidentally, wages also consistently risen right up until this point, because companies had to compete for competent workers. This opinion hasn't been too popular when I've brought it up before, but IMO two full time income households has fucked over the working class. By no means is this the fault of women, but I could definitely see the wealthy intentionally backing up the second wave for the simple fact that it was very, very profitable for them to do so."

You also get people complaining that feminism talking about any issue that isn't directly about women, i.e racism or poverty, is ""scope creep"" and an attempt to stay relevant."

If feminists really wanted to tackle the poverty in a fair way that helps all people then I'm sure they'd be welcomed.  Sometimes though, you have to just help others or improve humanity not because of your gender based politics, but because you actually feel empathy.  I don't know if I've mentioned this before, though I know we've spoken, I've certainly mentioned this on TiA, but I used to be a support worker for autistic people and later co-ordinator at a HIV / AIDS prevention project, I didn't do these things because of some political need, or desire to absolve my own guilt, I did it because I wanted to support those less fortunate than I am, and help them up, not push some people down whilst supporting the already blessed.   I think it's interesting that this got upvoted.   I think it's clear, /u/lifeonthegrid, what your beliefs are, and who you support.  Don't go around though, shocked people might agree with my or anyone elses statements, you're not the 'upvote police'.   And generally, even though very few people seem to be able to manage this rule, it's considered against 'reddiquette' to downvote simply because you don't agree with something.  I think in many ways many of us aren't against feminism, we're against ivory tower feminists, gender studies graduates, feminist busy-bodies and armchair activists.  Many of us want to just live our lives, raise a family and get on happily without fear.  Social-justice-warriors don't get that and have totally lost touch with people.  I think a lot of what we see on TiA is often anti-male, anti-masculinity, anti-white and racist.  I don't know about you, but all those things are as abhorrent to me as those skinheads neo-Nazi's.  All forms of sexism, racism and bigotry is wrong, whether it's directed at black people, Asians or yes white people, And I judge a person on the content of their character, their statements and their actions, not based on biological traits they can't change."

Ideally feminism probably should include men's issues, but in reality, it doesn't. Or it does in Christina Hoff Summer's ""equity feminism"", but I think most of you know what more extreme feminists like to think about her.  They bring the argument up when you ask about the dictionary definition which is pretty much ""equality between men and women"". If you ask about it further, you get nothing, because there really isn't nothing the current biggest branch of feminism has done for men. There is zero focus on men's issues. Matriarchy sure as hell isn't the answer.  And. If feminism really cared about men, they would be allies with MRAs. Maybe in my dreams.  Egalitarianism is the word for true equality between both sexes. Femism has always been the word for women to get on the level of men. They got there, they even went further, and they still think they are oppressed. But if you start talking about egalitarianism, the reaction is usually ""pissbaby neckbeard"" and ""I bet you have a fedora too"". Same as with atheism."

There are a huge number of things that can be called 'feminist' and more of the early feminism was only about women but feminists have branched out a lot since them.   The patriarchy idea isn't even a big part of most feminism now. A lot of feminism now is about who has power where and they know that a poor man might have very little power and a rich woman might have a lot.   I agree that people have a point to make about some types of feminism or the behavior of some feminists. Some people are kind and intellectually honest and some people like to use their ideas to beat other people over the head and feminists aren't perfectly innocent of that.   Personally, I think feminism happened because of technological and economic changes.  Women work because they have to and the more machines you have to do stuff, the less it matters who is physically stronger. I can't prove that though! :)"

It's not about men having sex with men or women having sex with women, its actually about the way women are treated by straight men. This has particularly infuriated me as a gay male.   I think this rests on the need to prove patriarchy 'theory.' The definition is so nebulous and ill defined that supporters try to throw as many 'proofs' as possible (a la gish gallop), so everything turns out to be an argument about misogyny. Homophobia?

I've also been guilty of using the ""free speech argument"" to defend ""problematic"" people.

Seems pretty relevant to me, we have become consumers of efficiency which leads to the most amount of enjoyment in the least amount of time, unfortunately this is an upward trend and we are not sated by our consumption but rather we crave more and more everytime we consume.   I think this leads us to believe we are bored most of the time...not because we are less engaged because we arguably have never been more engaged with so much at the same time...but because our ""fix"" isn't lasting like we think it should so no matter how much we consume we feel like we still aren't entertained, hence bored."
TiADiscussion,38ey3m,oversoul00,3,Wed Jun 3 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"I feel that's because the spark has been taken out of everything by making it so easily accessible. It used to be that even going to see a movie was a special event because you had to see it on the big screen and there was no replacement for that. It cost a lot of money so you could only do it rarely and of course it's often a social event too. But now you can just turn on Netflix whenever you want, so we take advantage of that and become dulled to it. Simply watching a movie is no longer special because it's so easy to do it on demand whenever we feel like it."

TiADiscussion,38bzbb,justja,17,Wed Jun 3 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you.  I grew up in a family with reversed traditional gender roles. I had a stay-at-home dad most of my childhood, and my mother made a lot of money working in traditionally male fields (petroleum geology, solar energy, nuclear waste, and government construction supervision were her big fields).   My sister and I were born before FMLA, so she only had a month's maternity leave for me and 2 weeks for my sister. She said that 2 weeks is not enough to physically recover from childbirth, and I believe her. We were raised by nannies until my parents decided it made more sense for my dad to do it.  My mom once relayed a story in which she'd told a male coworker that she'd hit the glass ceiling so many times she'd made a dent in it. Her coworker said, ""You've hit the glass ceiling so many times, you've broken it."" He probably believed it.  However, when she started work as a petroleum engineer, she wasn't allowed in the field without a male chaperone or allowed to drive a company car. She worked for a major oil company. Her immediate boss solved it by giving her a male college intern. By the time she retired, she was the second highest ranking female in her department, but was still not always taken seriously. By this point, she had won national awards for her work. I'm not talking ""we give this out to everyone who tries"" awards, but ""we fly you out there and you meet the appropriate federal Secretary"" awards.  I'll be the first to admit my mother has some personality issues. However, based on her experience and her accomplishments, she would have been better regarded if she were a man. I say this only because I know through her people with less experience and less profitable projects who got promoted over her."

My dad saw where this was going, but still replied he hasn't given birth. Lt. then told him he had no business being late. Admittedly, this was in '79.  I keep hearing things are getting better.  I thought I knew what it was like when I was guy, but transitioning had introduced me to a whole new set of hurdles. I don't believe most of it is intentional. I think people are just accustomed to things being a certain way. I know quite a few people just don't think about their behavior, or that it moves beyond them towards others."

First, based on this post and my quick scan of your posting history, it seems you are a transwoman. I applaud you for that, since I know it's difficult to publicly say, and I'm going to refer to you as female. I'm honestly sorry if that's not the case.  My father is a Vietnam vet. A week or two ago, I was talking to him about how I'm going to be volunteering at the Veterans' Law Clinic at my law school next year. I was discussing a few people's background (the student head is gay; the faculty adviser worked for the EEOC, etc.) and discussed some of the types of cases. My dad, who by no means saw the worst of Vietnam, said, ""Sometimes, it feels like I never left.""  A few years ago, my dad took me to meet up with some current and recently discharged members of his old Army unit. Many of them were in the film ""Restrepo."" (As a total aside, I got to feel shrapnel Restrepo himself was not able to extract.) It was amazing to me how different they were from other former military people I'd met. First, I was suffering from the worst of my anxiety disorder at that time and had just left a job because I couldn't deal with it. They were 100% supportive of that, and even though it's different, they likened it to PTSD. That made me feel a lot better, because they were basically saying there are chemicals in your brain you can't control.  My parents are a bit older (they had children in their 40s), but it really seems that the military has gotten much more progressive than it was in the 70s and 80s. Also, my mother basically said that her genes had failed her because my sister and I were in psychiatric care even though she has a family history of depression and clearly should be talking to someone."

I myself have a unisex name, so I'm used to being referred to as Mr., so I understand how annoying it is and how understandable it is.

It sounds like your parents may have more accepting of you than society. If that is the case, then I'm thankful. If not, I'm always here to talk to.   I'm honestly really interested in veterans' healthcare. I don't think it's what I want to devote my law career to, but I want to do a lot of pro bono work in the area. I know there is a lot of untreated mental issues, both pre-existing and brought on by combat. I have a very good friend who got kicked out of boot camp because he had a mental breakdown.  My mom is a funny person. When I was meeting the aforementioned vets, one of them said to me to thank my mom, because most women can't handle being married to a Vietnam vet.

TiADiscussion,38bzbb,niczar,10,Wed Jun 3 12:51:14 2015 UTC,"The wage gap is actually growing... for people under the age of 30... in favour of females. So if your concern is women making less overall than men, that's something that will go away over time. If you're not happy with the ""over time"" bit, well, unfortunately, change takes time.  However, you're right to be concerned about discrimination and sexism in the workplace. For one, I'm not sure that the rapid change in the pay gap for the younger generation has to do with less discrimination or sexism. In fact, I'd have to guess it has more to do with a combination of the death of a traditionally male-dominated industry that used to make up a significant portion of western GDP (manufacturing) and, well, ""benevolent sexism"" and quotas, with neither of these sweeping changes affecting older generations as much due to their positions being more firmly entrenched by seniority - a dying industry will stop hiring new employees before old ones are forced to leave, and a company with newly enforced quotas will stop hiring males and non-minorities before forcing the old ones are forced out.  One might ask why this isn't a good thing anyway, and I'd give the response that diversity in the workplace isn't an inherently good thing in it's own right, except that it is the logical result of a lack of bigotry in a society where every group is equally capable. (And as someone who flunked my shitlord training class isn't a bigot, I believe that in aggregate barring the disabled, every group is equally capable.) Essentially, with benevolent discrimination and quotas, we just lost a canary in the coal mine for sexism in society as well as our toucans. It still exists, it's just hidden from view.  ""But employing women acts as a means of wealth redistribution, which will empower women to finally break free of the shackles of sexism!"" - not if you're only getting a subsistence wage and the wealth of society continues to be held in majority by an increasingly very tiny minority of the population, which continues to be held together by tendrils of enforced nepotism and corruption.   Women have traditionally taken time off after maternity leave or gone back to work part time after giving birth. Is this because they want to? Is it because they're expected to? Is it because their husbands/partners won't take time off? Is it because employers don't think mothers are hard workers (I had a boss who was interviewing while a new mother and was given that reason for not being hired)? I read an article in this month's American Bar Association magazine about lawyers who make it hard for women to come back after maternity leave because they think they've missed too much, even when that's normally not even close to true.   Both new mothers and new fathers should be allowed time off, and they should both take it - it's what is best for the health of all involved - or it would be if it didn't have far reaching effects on your career prospects when there are plenty of other workers (yes, mostly men) that will not insist on taking this time off."
TiADiscussion,38bzbb,Penguin--Soldier,7,Wed Jun 3 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"Women generally don't work in industries such as mining and construction. What really should be studied is why they don't. Is it physical differences? Have they been conditioned not to? Are miners really misogynistic and driving women away?   Very good point.  I've long wondered, and lamented, why women don't go into IT. If you listen to SJWs, that's because we (IT workers) are supposedly so misogynistic that we turn women away. Well I must be completely blind and deaf because I've never noticed it.   (Actually, I know of one instance where a woman quit because a guy kept making misogynistic jokes at her expense. I only heard him crack one in her presence once and I literally couldn't help but call him out. Maybe I misinterpreted it but she actually seemed displeased with my accidental whiteknighting. Still puzzled by this. Anyway I got to know the guy later and well ... he's a fucking cunt to everyone. I can see how she took it badly; it's just wasn't institutional misogyny but merely an idiot with zero filter sperging.)  SJWs will claim that's because women are discouraged from going into these professions. There was an article on BoingBoing, right before I stopped going there, that said something along the lines that computers or IT offices should be decorated to appeal to women. Painted pink or something, I guess.   Well guess what, I started tinkering with computers around age 9 or 10, and that was long before Arpanet turned into the Iinternet. You couldn't have stopped me from hacking shit even if you tried. Most of my males relative of my generation were interested in computers (and incidentally we all work in IT or engineering!), none of the girls were (all now work in education but one!). Same for my peers at school.   When they say we push girl away from those fields ... I can only remember being dismayed at puberty when I realized that none of them had any interest in my favorite hobby. I would have been thrilled to share my passion with a girl.   So SJWs arguments are just completely bunk on the face of it. I wish there was more science on this, but the thing is, the only scholarly work on this is done from a moralistic SJW point of view, and it's almost never real science."
TiADiscussion,38bzbb,fuckingliterally,7,Wed Jun 3 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"As a girl studying computer science at this very moment, I feel like the interests part is directly a reason why there's so little girls in IT. There's not a single student that I know of right now that does not have a least some direct interest in games or computers since they were young.   Obviously this is well rather... obvious, when you consider that (for me at least) when we were young the ones that played games the most were guys, so they naturally took a faster interest in computers rather then girls. This is part why right now there's such a massive gap in the amount of male and female students.   I don't think the solution is so much to push girls into IT later on in their lives, but to show them the wonderful world of computers when they're younger. Also I agree that there should be more studies on this, since the gap is just really big.  Another reason might be the stigma, since I don't think lots of girls, and most people in general realize that going into IT doesn't mean you'll be stuck in a dark room writing code all your life. It can be so much more yet this doesn't really seem to hit with the general public."

You talk about all the male dominated jobs that don't require physical strength (though really it's more than just strength, and very much about working with hands even if in less strength intensive things like carpentry), but what about all the female dominated jobs?  Don't think there are any in that list that men wouldn't be capable of doing, so why so few?  You're right, there's societal pressures of all sorts pushing people in different directions in life.  But you can't just ignore the pressures that half of society faces if you want to have a real and meaningful talk about them.  You can't only look at this from the perspective of ""what do you women have to deal with"" that causes their choices/behaviors and assume that men are somehow free to do whatever the fuck they please in life.    Mining, construction, hard labor jobs that have high mortality rates, high incidences of serious injury and frequently cause general health issues.  Why do men go through that?  Why would someone choose a job in which their life was at risk, perhaps every day, just to get a paycheck?  Then think, if they're willing to do dangerous jobs, what about jobs they actively hate?  Ones that, while not as dangerous, make them miserable?    How many non-single mother women end up doing the same?  Because let's face it, we're not really talking about the lowest of the low minimum wage retail/fast food employees here; we're talking about the ""real"" decent paying jobs.  The ones usually requiring an education or specialized training.  The ones you have to work towards attaining, sometimes starting to work towards that before even entering the workforce.  Not the ones you usually end up going ""Oh shit, I've got a child to support suddenly, need whatever job I can find"" sort of jobs.  Or the ""accepting mediocrity"" staying around minimum wage most of your life 'cause you either don't have the educational opportunities or desires.    But seriously, don't fall into the trap of using men as some sort of ""base line"" as if they're the ideal you want to reach.  The whole idea of doing such is incredibly flawed and what leads to bullshit like the ""ironic misandrist"" feminists.  Men get shit on by society too.  They have pressures and ideals they're shown and expected to live up to.  A prominent one (if not the most prominent) is being the provider, because that's traditionally been their role.  Even now, with more and more women getting careers, there's still very much the attitude that ""it's what the woman wants"", not ""what's needed"" in that regard.  Meaning, they need to be prepared if she decides to become a stay at home mom once they have kids, even if her income was fairly important part of keeping their head above water.

Secondly, I don't disagree that there are non-physical differences between the sexes. My point is simply that there needs to be more research into that. I think that a lot of the research has been focused on hours worked and physical labor rather than the psychological factors. They may be innate; they may be a product of a sexist culture. We won't know until we do more research.  At a minimum, I've identified about 90 professions that have a male majority with no corresponding significant physical increase.

TiADiscussion,38bzbb,fuckingliterally,2,Wed Jun 3 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"European here. I don't have data, just a theory about why women are forced on a lesser pay equilibrium (per sector).  Because women are traditionally lower paid, lower educated (because they have been raised to care for their family instead of their career), and so traditionally males are dominating leadership positions in firms. So, around here the classic problem is, equally capable men and women earn different salaries. Why? Sometimes because men have more bullshit degrees, but what I suspect is a systemic double-standard in the people doing pay negotiations. That is, they are willing to give more to men, and are prepared to let go even more capable women if they want a raise. And since women lack collective bargaining, usually firms win these rounds.  That said, doing any kind of pan-sectoral comparison is fatally flawed, so the 77cent was dumb to begin with. As far as I know more women are enrolling in STEM fields than men, but ..

Similarly, demands that universities provide safe space can be used to chill controversial speech simply by making it logistically untenable to bring a controversial person around.  2) The implication that the presence of dissent makes an area ""unsafe"" can make people pretty angry, particularly if they hold an unpopular opinion in the 'real world' that is less likely to get that kind of courtesy from a university or other institution. The 'soft blankets and coloring books to help you find your peace' mentality shown in a lot of the ones that make the news (Oberlin) makes the whole thing look silly on top of seeming dangerous.  3) The actual mechanics of it favor certain progressive-friendly marginalized groups by allowing them to behave in exclusionary ways that would be excoriated or even legally punished coming from another group. (See ""ladies' night"" at my local comic book shop. I can't imagine a NO GIRLS ALLOWED night being at all popular, but it wouldn't matter because the store would get sued and potentially lose.)  Personally, I think it can be a little silly to see people feel like they need to run and hide from microagressions, but I'm not really opposed to safe spaces until you get to the point of barring dissent from entire areas of a school (a whole dorm, for instance), provided that the other side of the coin can be afforded the same privilege. If you as the arbiter start taking sides and saying ""this is a civil rights abuse, this is a laudable attempt at inclusivity and progressivism"" you're violating the spirit of the law."

Like if you had a group that was meant to be a safe space for people with a particular issue, that's totally fine and could be helpful. But it's just that one meetup group, or subreddit, or website, or whatever, the thing that is owned/operated by that specific group.

I'm fairly used to the gay bar being an obvious safe space.  It's a place where  I know I won't be unwelcome, and LGBT people can engage in behaviour that might not be welcome in other places, just because it involves a same sex pairing.  Or a guy wearing women's clothes (not transgender).  I think it's the same for a VFW or American Legion bar.  It's a place where you can be yourself, and not worry about being judged, mocked, or threatened.  Veterans do still get prejudice from peace activists, and sometimes they just want to surround themselves with people who understand what they've been through.  I think at the end of the day, it's really what we all want.  Certain groups tend to get that space automatically, and sometimes groups have to demand it.

There is no discourse in a 'safe space'. You're allowed to listen and obey, and that's it.

Non-alcoholics are welcomed to AA meetings with open arms - because family members, siblings, and children of alcoholics need support too and can learn from visiting and participating in a meeting.  When I was in group therapy, therapists would often speak about their personal experiences and discuss how they would apply the skills we were learning.  There is much to be learned from everyone, and having an outsider's perspective can be extremely beneficial.    Why would you exclude someone when you can learn from them?  As long as they're respectful, there's no reason why you should exclude anyone.    My problem with ""safe spaces"" is that people don't understand what they are.  A safe space doesn't mean that you only allow certain people in.  It doesn't mean that you exclude people who disagree.  It means that as a baseline, you support certain things and won't kick someone out of your office for being gay.  But disagreement, discussions, other opinions?  Completely welcomed.    For example: if someone disagrees with your opinion in a support group, they don't get kicked out.  The moderator or leader leads a respectful discussion about the issue and everyone agrees to disagree.

How Safe Spaces Work in Real Life 101:  You create a safe space for a group, let's say trans people. The overwhelming majority of trans people are fairly left wing, because that's just how it is. Also, more radical people are drawn to these safe spaces because that's just they way it is.  They're also going to discuss political issues because pretty much the majority of trans issues are political issues, it can't be avoided.  So the first thing that's going to happen is that the radicals are going to establish dominance over the group because that's what they do. They care more than anyone else, and they have a desire to control the group more than anyone else, so they'll naturally take over.  The next thing that's going to happen is they're going to suss out any conservative or moderately right wing members of the group (if they exist), or anyone who openly dissents against their opinion.   They'll then go around campaigning to get everyone to ban said dissenters from the group because ""they don't feel safe"" having them around with their unpopular and/or dissenting opinions.   This will create a bunch of drama that will tear the group apart. All of the dissenters will either be banned or feel unwelcome in what was supposed to be a safe space and leave, and then all of the more moderate voices who were against the radicals trying to kick out the dissenters out/starting a bunch of unnecessary drama, will leave because they don't like the hostile, drama filled environment.  At this point all you have left in the safe space are radicals and a bunch of non-radical but scared trans people, who disagree with the radicals, but don't want to speak out because they've finally found a real community for the first time in their lives, and don't want to lose that because they express the wrong opinions about something.

The issue occurs when a ""safe space from being hated"" for being trans (or women) is postulated to only be possible through the exclusion of all cis people (or men).  The idea that whites can't be let into ""safe spaces"" for minorities because white people will inevitably be racist or some such.  A ""safe space"" as a space free of harassment, where discussion is moderated and those who can't keep calm/civil are tossed is one thing.

I'll end by saying we're supposed to be mature equal adults in society, let's behave as such, and not be afraid to share ideas.   Okay, so why do these 'hugbox' safe spaces threaten your ability to share ideas? Are there not plenty of other outlets? If somebody wants to sit in a room playing with puppies and not enjoy the experience of being exposed to new ideas, how does this impact your ability to share ideas?"

Is this a group for people, where outsiders won't gain anything?

TiADiscussion,38aoae,punkbrad7,11,Wed Jun 3 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"I've been to LGB groups, since I'm part of that demographic.  Where we discuss issues we face.  I was also a HIV / AIDS prevention worker so I'm fairly well versed in what constitutes a healthy space and constitutes an exclusionary space.   I think we have ideological differences."
TiADiscussion,38aoae,vuxanov,8,Wed Jun 3 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say first off that I'm against trying to force safe spaces on people who don't want them. I also don't like it when safe spaces are infantalized, with teddy bears and coloring books and the like.  However, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have a safe space, and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to exclude certain groups from those spaces. Do some safe spaces want to exclude certain groups because they see them as inherently predatory or likely to be rude/insulting? Yes, and that's wrong. But as someone who was born disabled, I've been going to ""safe spaces"" that excluded people without that disability since I was a kid. Is it because we think able-bodied people are nasty and mean and should be shunned? No.  It's because human beings, in general, are curious and eager to learn and discover new things. They see a disabled person, or someone with a disability aid, and think: I wonder how that happened? How does it work? Sometimes the reactions are even positive; I have a high-tech prosthetic that people tend to be fascinated by!  But here's the thing: even if they're completely non-malicious, it can get tiring to answer those questions over and over and over and over again. Sometimes you just want to chill with people you don't have to tackle that elephant in the room with, because they already know. And that's okay. It doesn't mean you're rejecting reality and creating a hugbox to avoid growing and learning. It means you're taking a break. There are also embarrassing problems relating to my disability that I'd definitely be afraid to talk about in front of people who likely haven't faced that problem and would be a bit surprised or grossed out that it happens...Especially as a teenager, I would have been mortified to discuss disability-related problems in front of people without that specific disability. I'm more secure about it now, but some people aren't (people who acquire that disability later in life instead of being born with it tend to be more nervous I find).  I've been trans for a few years and disabled all my life, I find that revealing I'm trans tends to result in similar curiosity and another set of questions I have to go over with non-trans people I meet. And again, they're not malicious. Just curious. But sometimes I need time with people who have nothing to be curious about.  The problem with safe spaces starts when people demand every single space be a safe space, or when they lose the ability to interact with people outside of safe spaces. But as long as it's not being forced on public places (like universities) who cares if some people decide to gather with people similar to them for a while? Not everyone is obligated to include every curious onlooker in their group conversation, whether it be about LGBT issues or Star Trek or last night's homework. Hell, I find ""you must never exclude anyone"" attitudes infantalizing, too. Are you not allowed to select your own companions now? The last place I was in that had a ""you must never turn down anyone who asks to join in!"" rule was elementary school."

I'll have to echo the other responses in that I believe that the TIA/SJW 'safe space' you see dismissed on this and a few other subs tends to be a perceived tactic to impose heterogeneous thought throughout a wider institution (or basically: stiffle dissenting opinions)."

It's a fucking echo chamber used in response to microaggresions where those who are offended can literally only go to listen and obey. People can easily extend disagreement to be microaggressions and can protect themselves from all forms of criticism, discourse, and disagreement by running to a ""safe space"".   This creates opposing groups that have an excuse to not ever participate in discourse."
TiADiscussion,38aoae,Spysnakez,6,Thu Jun 4 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"The problem is the idea of what Safe Spaces have become.   When I was in college, we ran a GSA with our own little place called the Outlet. It was in a dorm, but you still had to have a card to be given access, but we never discriminated based on anything short of people being assholes. We had weekly meetings there, and usually ended the meetings with discussion or stuff we had planned (like protests or just general stuff like the Day of Silence Vigil we did for a few years). It was open the same hours as the dorm for visiting hours, and we tried to have someone there the entire open hours as someone who ANYBODY could come in and talk to if they had any issues.  Safe Space now, means somewhere you can go and not have to deal with any kind of dissent or discouragement and have everyone go ""Yeah you're right"" instead of saying ""Ok, but how about this?"""

When people define the term safe space they seem to be referring to daycare-like spaces with puppies and cookies and crayons, but I think this might be an extreme example and might not actually be what a safe space is.

Look, I'm all for safe spaces for groups like people with disabilities or maybe even trans because I imagine they can get quite some shit thrown at them depending on where they are. The idea that there's a room for those people to sit down and not be bothered is actually pretty nice because sometimes things just get too much. Like if you have an anxiety attack, as good as people mean it, having 6 people asking you why you are crying isn't solving anything, and being able to go to a room where there's someone who knows how to handle someone upset, is actually a nice idea.   Now most of the safe spaces we see are for women or minorities. The one for women is just plain stupid, unless your university is full of men that sexually harass you 24/7. The one for minorities CAN be justified I guess, if they legitimately get tons of racism against them. But for any other reason it just ends up sounding like ""well every white person is a flaming racist so we need a safe space!"" which is a very dangerous mindset, since they inherently assume everyone is out to get them.   TL;DR: the general idea is nice, but the groups that claim safe spaces right now are creating a very dangerous mindset."

TiADiscussion,38aoae,Martijngamer,2,Wed Jun 3 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is that safe spaces are intrinsically relative. It is impossible to make a space that is safe for everyone, and enforcing safety for one group is likely to enforce lack of safety for another. When someone says ""safe space"", they're almost invariably proposing an ""unsafe space"" for someone else.  And given how ""safe spaces"" tend to be designed, that someone else is generally ""anyone with differing political opinions""."
TiADiscussion,38aoae,Stag_in_the_Fog,2,Wed Jun 3 08:15:56 2015 UTC,"I think its less that people care about the idea of a safe space in general, and more that in practice, these places are in some cases used for ideological centers that are there to ingrain people into certain ideology. And that they're only safe within the confines of that ideology, not in general. And they see the people setting them up as basically trying to create echo chambers where certain narratives are enforced, and advocated under the guise of just being about protection. And which they use as a ground to try to expand this while being beyond criticism. So in other words, its not a generic support group, but a particular type of heavily ideological thing. And this isn't just incidental. The modern format of it actively tries to be this oftentimes. And even tries to crowd out / dismantle versions of itself that are not this.  The one at my school is literally a tiny two seat office though. So I doubt it does any of this, or even gets used that often."

As an example, Muslim women being able to remove their face scarves and have a coffee, or queer people being able to sit around and be themselves without worrying people are going to freak the fuck out if they act too fabulous, things like that are completely fine. The issue is the politics around these spaces sometimes devolves into hugbox group-think weirdness. If SJWs manage to gain authority within a space, the space begins to drop members fast because the only people who are welcome are those who tow the correct ideological line: everyone else is branded ""unsafe"" or a ""threat""...   In short, the problem with safe spaces is that they aren't structured to deal with SJW ideology and reasoning: I am pure and anti-oppressive, so everything I don't like is gross and oppressive and threatening, so must be excluded. The end result is the most marginalised (often queer women of colour) end up not being welcome in ""safe spaces"" whilst the very most privileged people (straight white women) tend to dominate everything."

Most people have heard of sonic the hedgehog and there are a lot of sonic jokes on tumblr already, a lot of people on tumblr dislike the anti-sjw crowd in general and seized the opportunity to make fun of them, and even people who don't have anything against them tend to think that those ""x-for-real-justice"" blogs are pretty cringey. Personally, I can't take people seriously if they're pretending to be a hedgehog or an anime character or what have you, even if they make good arguments while doing it."

Not always though, I've seen those roles reversed plenty of times.  Then again, maybe I just hate people in general. I've seen the worst of both worlds. I've seen some good, though.  For an example of a good man, my best friend can be shown. Sure, he can be blunt, opinionated, stubborn, and a bit of an asshole at times, but he's quite forgiving, very willing to let go of beefs, and quite sensitive. He's funny, helpful, intelligent, and he genuinely cares for those close to him. He's always careful about actually hurting someone vs poking fun at them. He has accidentally hurt people by his jokes, but it's never intentional. (He also earns points for being the only person to fully understand me, so I miiiiiight be biased.)

I don't want to seem aggressive, but I have to comment on some of your points.  Disclaimer: white cishet male. Poor as hell. Northern European.   I just tend to believe them. The media tends to portray men as essentially cannon fodder for the Grim Reaper as opposed to having anything of value, and the guys I've been surrounded by are usually complete jerks or nerds and/or sound and look like it.   I don't quite understand, is it  a good or a bad thing that men are seen as cannon fodder? Why do you believe the media narrative at all? I kind of get a picture that you are a young person still, and haven't seen much of male behaviour outside of school environment. I can assure you, as people mature, they turn out to be something other than jock/nerd stereotypes. Well, most of them, some people are just assholes. And holy hell can some women be huge assholes too.   I feel like all the good guys are probably living really comfy upper-middle class lives and even then are pretty self-centred.   Comfy upper-middle guys seem to be more entitled and irritating in my experience. And ""nice guys"" are often ridiculed, so you can see a lot of people trying to be aggressively manly when it doesn't suit them.   I've read somewhere also how there are women who are capable of being more physically strong and resilient versus guys, even outside of labour.   Don't buy into it. Every time something so general as women versus men comes up, it's feminist (or red pill) propaganda. You simply can't just compare half a population of the earth directly to the other half. There are strong women and strong men, weak women and weak men.   Sometimes I feel like I want to meet a transman so I can understand that femininity isn't all that pretty. When I read about masculine traits one time, I felt that we're quite naturally ""cold"", so I strived to be more feminine even though I guess it's not in my nature to.   You probably have strong bias against masculinity for some reason. It has good traits just like feminity has. For example, see the traditional father role. A man was expected to pretty much work until death, providing selflessly for his family. Versus a gangbanger going after money and whores. A selfless mother sacrificing her time and body for her children so that they could grow up. Versus an irrational, golddigging psycho woman exploiting everyone. You get the point.  What you see is the the ""women are wonderful"" effect, which SuperPizzaGame mentioned already. She has good points and actually explains this better than me. Had to chip in anyway."

The media tends to portray men as essentially cannon fodder for the Grim Reaper as opposed to having anything of value   And how exactly is this a good thing, or something for you to buy into? Hell, this ""cannon fodder for the Grim Reaper"" stereotype is commonly referred to by MRAs as the ""Empathy Gap,"" and refers to the widespread cultural perception that men's lives are outright less important than women's. And this empathy gap contributes to, among other things:   Utter lack of support for male victims of abuse or rape. Males being several times more likely to be the victims of violent crimes. Male suicide rates being much higher General lack of mental health resources for men.   The fact that you believe this stereotype says far more about your character than it does about the male gender.   and the guys I've been surrounded by are usually complete jerks or nerds and/or sound and look like it.   So, what you're saying is you primarily judge guys by superficial traits like sound and appearance, and look down on those who are ""nerdy,"" aka social awkward?   I feel like all the good guys are probably living really comfy upper-middle class lives and even then are pretty self-centred.  I've read somewhere also how there are women who are capable of being more physically strong and resilient versus guys, even outside of labour.   ...Duh. Of course a female professional athlete, or soldier, or whatever will be stronger than most guys. But as a class? Just the fact that males are heavier on average gives them more strength.  However, this is irrelevant because you shouldn't be considering people, let alone groups of people, morally inferior based on physical aptitude. It's like saying ""The filthy Asian Untermenschen are terrible at basketball, clearly we Dutch (Holland has a very high average height, that's why I picked it) are the master race!""

However, many people see community in the transgender label so they call themselves transwomen as a way to identify themselves as part of that community. A simple: hey we have had similar experiences  It also is a way to bring up issues that affect only a specific group of women. Women with a transgender status and men with transgender have distinct issues that aren't faced by other women or men.  It depends on the person and what they want to do with their life. My goal in life is to simply live my life as a girl, which unfortunately means hiding in the long run my transgender status. Some people are okay with having a transgender identity and they don't mind being labeled as such.  It really depends on the person and their preference. How much of their identity is rooted in their gender identity really determines how they identity.   Some people live their lives as openly transgender, others like me try to avoid it being an open thing and be more of a private manner."

Secondly, so does specifically identifying yourself as a certain type of thing no longer make you that thing?  So a black woman is not a woman if she refers to herself as a black woman instead of just woman?  A disabled woman is no longer a woman if she refers to herself as a disable woman instead of just woman?  Lastly, I mean there's no way you're this anti-logic where you can't figure out how reason this one out, right?

And before people say that construction was publicslky funded, bullshit. Whenever construction began, tuition surprisingly went UP as part of ""Student Fees"" or ""Base Tuition"". Interesting coincidence, eh? University presidents get elected, put all sorts of construction projects up, then leave the bill to the students and the next one."

It looks like that women are more likely to be labeled based on looks while men seem to be labeled a bit more based on achievements.  I am skeptical of your conclusion that men are more likely to be labeled with prejorative nouns. Note that you've not included prejoratives like ""bitch"" or ""cunt"" which would obviously skew your results since those are gendered insults but as you have it now, they arent accounted for.

I, too, think about this topic, and right now I feel like putting pen to paper, as it were.   Hmm. Discussion. Usually implies two or more people going back and forth, but here he uses it to refer to his own commentary. Odd. Do I recall, however, older writers using the word that way? I might...but I can't be sure. At any rate...   I emphasize. My long-term #1, going way back: using ignorant to mean stupid. We have enough stupids already. We only have one ignorant. (Unaware doesn't quite hit the mark.) If we lose it, we're down not just a word, but a concept. You maniacs! V for Vendetta was wrong. You can kill an idea.  What to do? I don't know. I'd start slapping people if I thought it would catch on. Unfortunately most people who are ""into"" word choice are pussies, ergo my slapping movement is stillborn.  For now, we cogitate.   What are words?   Individual nodes in an inter-referential matrix of meaning. Or do I mean intra? Probably both. A word w refers to a thing x, yes, but that relationship is not a closed system. Words do not exist outside of or beyond their users, people.   When I choose a word, what I'm really doing is relaying meaning based on that word's node's coordinates relative to the others in the system. A shop is open, or it is closed. One or the other. Not ajar, not shut. Not partially open. Those 3 options are open available to doors, and the latter 2 to windows, but where shops are concerned, open has only one competitor. When I say a shop is open, I absolutely mean it is not closed. Words themselves have the context of the other sensical words not chosen.  In human language, anyway. In programming, that is not the case, which is why it's irritating and also why all software is broken. Broken-ish, at least. ""There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.""   Programmers are natural contrarians. They disagree about everything. They question every truism.

No, that is not cognitive dissonance.   Holding conflicting belief is not cognitive dissonance. Having them actually conflict is cognitive dissonance.   Fore example, you may consider yourself non racist, but then realize that you wrongly assumed  a black person was up to no good because they were black; that's dissonance. You may consider yourself non racist and keep saying shit about one particular race; not dissonance as long as the contradiction does not rise to your consciousness.

TiADiscussion,384pmw,shadow__creator,22,Mon Jun 1 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"They're my favorite/happiest TIA group to observe.   I think that the ""entertainment"" I draw from browsing TIA is to look at all of these groups' extreme views and then piece together who they are as a person. I think a lot of users like to post screenshots of the craziest shit they can find and say ""Oh wow this person is fucking nuts"" and that's it. That alone can be pretty interesting as well, just to see what the human mind can come up with; the shit like killing all men and hating all whites and stuff. But they're real people, and it's possible you know one of them, you know?  So when I see the stuff about someone just hating thin people as a whole, for example, and then you go deeper into the blog and find a young fat girl who's still in school and doesn't love herself and turns to her blog to say extreme, emotional stuff -- I feel like it guides me in the real world, reminds me to be compassionate to people who's struggles that I just don't relate to, whether I ""agree"" with them or not. Because like almost everyone on TIA, I do think these opinions are crazy, and I don't necessarily think they ""should"" feel those ways, because it causes emotional turmoil within themselves and others. But anonymously poking a bit of fun at them isn't going to change that in any way.   But apart from that important social stuff, when someone says ""I'm a dragon, if you don't like it you can fuck off!"" it does give me a laugh, but more along the lines of ""Fuck yeah, kid, I have no idea what you're talking about but you do your thing.""   And that's nice."
TiADiscussion,384pmw,PrincessBukowski,12,Mon Jun 1 22:04:40 2015 UTC,"Eh. I don't like the way people handle it on TiA. It seems to be along the lines of ""haha look at this fag"" rather than poking fun at Tumblr's extremists. (which is what the original purpose of the sub is.)"
TiADiscussion,384pmw,PrincessBukowski,10,Mon Jun 1 22:15:11 2015 UTC,"Right. I don't know if I explained it well but I feel the same way. I've been on TIA for a very long time at this point and the direction it has taken as the sub has grown makes me sad. I used to love reading the comments because there were productive debates and a lot of new information was shared and I felt like I was learning and my mind was growing. I come from a background of almost falling into the SJW category, when it came to basic things like feminism, race and LGBTQ stuff, I just didn't have a blog. And I was afraid to criticize anything I read from SJWs because I didn't want to become a bigot, basically, which seems silly now. So I haven't lost any of my core values, but old TIA was a great reminder to think for myself, question everything, and then decide what my beliefs are. I don't really fall into the realm of SJW at all any more, but now I don't really want to be associated with the new TIA community, even though I loved the old one.  Nowadays, to put it frankly, many of the comments are fat-hating, woman-hating, and racist, in that order, among other things. They used to point out the logical fallacies and hypocrisy in SJW extremists' arguments. Now many of them just prove them right."

All of a sudden you were hearing about feminism and SJWs everywhere, and places where you would never normally hear about it you were suddenly hearing about it everywhere, and if you hadn't already you had to pick a side in a debate, whatever the ""sides"" were.  Like, four years ago if you went on Gawker and said ""MRA"" maybe 10 people viewing the article would've known what you are talking about. Now Gawker is fully entrenched in internet gender wars. Four years ago if you went on Slashdot and tried to steer the discussion section to some snark against Feminists and tech, everyone would be puzzled and you'd have a negative score for being off-topic.  But a lot of feminist topics and viewpoints had their ""moment"" in 2013, 2014 whether it was on Valleywag or Medium or Times. And it snowballed from there, picking up hundreds of thousands of new people with free time and a keyboard.  I don't think there will be a moment where people say ""We've had enough of this fighting!"" or the different sides to reconcile their differences. I think it will go the way of most political cycles. Back in the early 2000s I remember a lot more people talking about issues that while still talked about, are to varying degrees less talked about now: environmentalism, CAFTA/Globalization, darfur. People just forgot about it as they got interested in a new political hobby horse."

Gawker media inc is essentially agnostic to whatever cause is being espoused, so long as saying it loud is generating revenue.

They're also suckers if they think that corporate will care the slightest about them when the winds shift... and call me cynical, but when the weather-vane swivels I don't think there's going to be a whole lot of market for these barely-educated former Gawker cog-suckers."

I first got into TiA in 2003 as a lurker, since then these things have blown up: Sarkeesian amped up her campaign, Suey Park had a few psychotic break downs, Cracked went off the deep end, CHS published a few controversial books, some art major lugged around a mattress, the Obama administration came out against rape culture, ect. TiA was never equipped to handle seriously national diving issues."

TiADiscussion,380dbw,CUDesu,29,Mon Jun 1 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"More disturbing though is the prevalence of genuine hateful attitudes gaining popularity on TiA. I see red pill being defended and upvoted. I see people saying SJWs deserve to be thrown in jail and downvotes being thrown at those who disagree. I see people saying SJWs should be doxxed because they deserve it for being stupid. I see dissent downvoted into oblivion and ignored if it interrupts the circlejerk. I see content that just looks like it should be on FPH.   I suppose I don't visit TiA enough because I haven't seen this kind of thing happening, especially not any defense of red pill. When I do visit a TiA thread I do see all the 'shitlord' jokes and whatnot that you mentioned but I also see some good discussion.  I can only assume you read TiA threads more than I do so I can't say that you're wrong but at the same time I can't agree based on my experience with the sub. I see some jokes, some of which are decent when they're not the same thing that's been said a thousand times prior, and I see some actual discussion about the topic going on. Compared to a lot of other subs TiA isn't doing so bad if you ask me."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,habeascorpvs,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:00:13 2015 UTC,It's a shadow of its former self.  As for red pill it's something that's slowly creeping in and whether or not it gets upvoted depends on the thread. But you do see threads where you get downvoted for speaking against red pill.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,brent0935,128,Mon Jun 1 10:33:39 2015 UTC,"I think part of TiA's bitterness comes from moderate Democrats who have come to hate internet slacktivism, tumblr feminists, and identity politics, because they've pulled Democratic ideology so far away from labor, the environment, and poverty relief (and pulled Democrats running for office instead into gender and identity politics) that it significantly reduced liberal turnout in 2014. At least everyone I've met in real life that's tired of LGBT and race issues and hates feminists feels that way because those issues are dominating the progressive political sphere and costing Democrats the working class vote, who don't identify with those issues.   Edit: Cool, this is on badpolitics now. I guess disagreeing with the sjw hug box makes me a) male and b) completely oblivious to politics and, allegedly, only in tune with tumblrinaction. It can't possibly have anything to do with trying to find explanations for the abysmal democratic turnout last election, or being in college with a bunch of misandrist feminists that don't vote because they ""don't want to enable white men."" Okay, you write your own version of the present, badpolitics."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,habeascorpvs,74,Mon Jun 1 00:29:03 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. I'm pretty fucking far left, and I know a lot of people that would agree with a lot of things that get posted to TiA, and it's annoying, Bc those aren't important issues in the long run. Like, there's a hell of a lot more important shit going in labor and with poverty and bc of the SJW types in leftist politics, it's become extremely hard to have a serious discussion with just about anyone. People on the far left want to push their SJW agendas, come hell or high water, and moderates and right wingers won't take us seriously bc they see us as nothing more than crazy people like the mattress girl or Anita Sarkisian (SP?)   The SJW types are a huge minority, yet they've majorly fucked up any legitimacy the left had :("
TiADiscussion,380dbw,brent0935,47,Mon Jun 1 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Sarkeesian, iirc. Anyway, I'm just grumpy democrats have become the party of killallmen feminists, sjw political-correctness police, and people whose only voting issues are women, race, gays, and/or marijuana legalization. Where's my social safety net giving, unionization supporting, wage raising, blue-collar electorate party?"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,habeascorpvs,31,Mon Jun 1 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly! The SJW fringe hasn't taken over the party, but they have taken over the public perception of it, and it's a damn shame. Well, that and the left hasn't really had much of a spine for a good while now. And the SJW types are using that to walk all over those that want to identify with the democrats on the legacy stuff like you said"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,brent0935,24,Mon Jun 1 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"And it's ridiculous that labor and poverty are considered ""old/outdated"" issues by younger members of the party. No. They always have been and always will be issues, and it's progressives' job to alleviate them as much as possible. But still, young people are voting for independent candidates and unelectable far-right primary candidates that reduce blue-collar voter turnout. For example, I live in WV, and a carpetbagger from Maryland is now my representative, because an independent ran on our ticket and split the young collegiate liberal vote. All because he talked a big game about identity politics and pot, and because these young voters don't get that independents are only there to divide liberals and hand the race to the Republican. Ugh. So much misinformation abounds within young liberalism, and the focus on SJ issues (and their rampant lack of hard facts) is only making it worse."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,habeascorpvs,13,Mon Jun 1 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"Sadly i understand that completely. I live in Memphis, and the people here constantly vote people back into office that aren't qualified to be a janitor let alone on a city council just bc of identity politics. One lady has like 3 or 4 DUIs  and still is voted back in over and over.  Thankfully (and I can't believe I'm saying this...) the university's here are pretty damn conservative, so there isn't a huge SJW presence, but it's definitely seeping in slowly.   But there's actually a really active socialist party usa chapter here that's mostly college kids that's been going out and protesting for a lot of labor issues, so it's refreshing to see a left wing group advocating for true labour issues instead of SJ type stuff. It's a weird island of sanity in a really fucking weird city"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,thenichi,6,Mon Jun 1 04:00:04 2015 UTC,I can't believe that advocating for poverty relief and adequate compensation for labor now makes people socialists. Seems a bit backwards to me. At least it sounds like where that's the case the title socialist doesn't have as negative of connotations as it does on the national scale.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,SRSLovesGawker,6,Mon Jun 1 09:45:34 2015 UTC,The younger generation didn't grow up in the Cold War so socialist isn't much a dirty word.

TiADiscussion,380dbw,Rbnblaze,13,Mon Jun 1 16:12:02 2015 UTC,I wonder if that's how moderate righties feel about the Tea Party.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,zwiebelsaft,6,Mon Jun 1 12:01:05 2015 UTC,"At least the tea party separates itself from the main chunk of conservatives, the left has its crazies mixed in with the rest"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,MosDaf,7,Wed Jun 3 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"Count me in that aspect. While I don't completely agree with all the policies of the left just because the economy has changed drastically since the 40's, 50's, and 60's, it would be nice to talk about actual labor issues in lieu of the same sound bites that politicians constantly talk about. Such as gender and ""religious freedom"". The content as a result became much more political because it's a backlash due to Obama's now weak legacy over gender and the (un)affordable health care act."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,alts_are_people_too,18,Mon Jun 1 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. That's me. I'm mostly liberal, but I think that many liberals are way too tolerant of the loony left.  The SJW phenomenon is a replay of the political correctness phenomenon of the 80-90s, and the same thing is happening. That is, many liberals are afraid to criticize the left, no matter how stupid and illiberal it gets. In fact, many alleged liberals are turning out to be nutty leftists as soon as that becomes fashionable. And they're  turning liberalism into the kind of crackpot feels-o-centric, irrationalist, totalitarian pile of shit that conservatives have long accused it of being. But, tbh, I've been around TiA for quite awhile and I don't think that its that bad...  I mean...people really stretch for reasons to get pissed now...but I still like the place."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,esouhnet,10,Mon Jun 1 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest...  I'm not sure what to do about the loony left myself.  Most leftist Internet spaces are completely dominated by them now, and there's a (justified) fear that if you speak up, you'll be banned."

TiADiscussion,380dbw,RedAero,15,Mon Jun 1 16:27:24 2015 UTC,most of them are young teens who aren't harming anyone and will most likely grow out of it.   There's a reason there's an age limit.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,HoneyVortex,6,Mon Jun 1 01:17:37 2015 UTC,I also think there is too much making fun of them. Teens will believe a lot of cringe worthy BS but it isn't special to me until they claim being a cat person makes them real world oppressed.

TiADiscussion,380dbw,heartjuice,47,Sun May 31 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because the sub keeps getting split into smaller segments and has things that ""can't be talked about"" in the moratorium, and the sub count gets larger. We get the same tired content. There's no sanity, that's split to /r/TumblrAtRest because at one time we got too much. There's no long discussion posts between the larger community, it was delegated here to a community of ~6000.   There are a lot of things that are unavoidable, like Mattress Girl/Gamergate and such just increasing the hate for pseudo-equality feminism (lol we need equity not equality type feminism).  I certainly don't really enjoy the posts now. People don't remember that TiA was a place to laugh and circlejerk like /r/thathappened is. It wasn't a place to just go and hate and repeat the same shitty joke like it was actually funny.   What I'm trying to say is that only one type of content is provided because that's all that's eventually allowed. It's hard to get MRA crazy because TiA isn't meta. It's hard to get RedPill stuff for the same reason, plus most people can't stomach going to RoK. I don't feel like it's really a community of people anymore like it used to be. I could name a lot of the older users due to their writing style, their flairs, what they posted. But now..it's just all the same. And I'm not sure what to say about it all. I really do believe the content being choked is a big part of it along with the population growth. People stick with what's safe. I've seen the same Tenaflyviper post the past 4 fucking sanity sundays because people don't post sanity just to post it when it happens anymore. It's now a ""look at why they're wrong."" TiA changed from a lite-circlejerk, joking about the people they found, into a hugbox. The people aren't a community anymore. They're just commenters. Everyone is disassociated with each other, unless you're a power user and have the time to comment on every fucking post.   I miss the old right wingers and left wingers of the sub too. The ones that disagreed but backed that shit up, and gave for a good discussion. Now it's the extremes of both sides.   I could go on, but I have homework and I just wanted to put my thoughts down because there was a good discussion for me finally. I miss the community of TiA the most. I used to enjoy going there. Now it's just the same boring post or repost after boring repost. No discussion, no sanity. Just shit-flinging and ironic shitlords and toucan jokes. There's nobody really commenting that knows the issue. It's all witty one-liners and such to the new people. I really, really do miss the day where you could see a funny one liner, and get a paragraph of text discussing the post. Now everything is just imgur links, you can't even see the context of the blog much anymore without going to search for it yourself.   Thanks for this post EFS. It means a lot, seeing how I've recently become jaded about the sub, too."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theroachsays,6,Mon Jun 1 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is most of those rules are exactly the same as they were when TiA only had 50,000 subscribers. It just hasn't scaled well. The list of banned content is the only new one but I understand why - they've got to do something to attempt to control single topics taking over the entire sub, which is exactly what happened with growth before that rule.   TiA changed from a lite-circlejerk, joking about the people they found, into a hugbox. The people aren't a community anymore. They're just commenters. Everyone is disassociated with each other, unless you're a power user and have the time to comment on every fucking post.   Yep, this is what I find sad. Inevitable with growth but still very sad."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,heartjuice,7,Mon Jun 1 10:30:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/RedAero . I think Sanity should be every day so we can cut down on the same sanity posts every Sunday. Also, for things like mattress girl, I think there should be a megathread not a content ban. I've never moderated so I can't talk about the logistics like you probably can, but it makes sense to me. It puts all the content from a huge thing like that into one thread, not clogging the sub with it & I'm guessing making it easier to moderate? I just think it'd lead to more discussion about the topic if we had one huge thread for it instead of a content ban. Less ""witty"" comments alluding to it and all that. You'd have to tell me if it sounded feasible or not, I've never modded.   And yeah, at 50,000 we all knew to respect the rules. But at 200k we get new people every day who don't know the rules at all. It makes it really hard to enforce them as the number of people to enforce them on grows."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theroachsays,8,Mon Jun 1 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"they've got to do something to attempt to control single topics taking over the entire sub   Sure, but essentially what these rules do is take out all the veggies from a soup because sometimes you get a whole carrot in your bowl, so now it's just salty water.  Please, for heaven's sake, make Sanity Sunday Sanity Every Day. The sub needs balance, people are getting wound up more than they need to because of their filter."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,heartjuice,9,Mon Jun 1 18:08:21 2015 UTC,The truth is that many people who hate Social Justice 'Safe Space' feminists are actually leftists. Our voice for criticism of them seems only supported on the right. Strange.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,JulienMayfair,4,Mon Jun 1 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's what happened with Gamergate.  Most are anti-authoritarian left-wing--and the ones who are right-wing, are overwhelmingly libertarian.  It wasn't a conservative movement.  Breitbart and Milo only showed up when they saw gamers being hatekicked.  The conservatives weren't gamers themselves, they just saw how ridiculous it was."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theroachsays,63,Fri Jun 5 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks EFS, and several have expressed this sentiment on here (we had a ""concerned about TiA megathread going for a while). As you stated, I do believe a lot of it stems from all of the real life SJ crazy infecting college campuses and the media (I work on a college campus, so deal with this stuff in real life), so naturally the sub has become a lot more politicized than it has in the past. While I have seen most hateful comments downvoted and reported actually, I will agree there has been an increase in them in the past year since I first joined."

I found my way here after getting back into LGBT activism around marriage equality, and I was disturbed by the level of language and viewpoint policing on some of the LGBT subs. For better or worse, in creating TiA, you tapped into a major cultural flashpoint. I sincerely wish it were going away, but for the moment, it's showing no signs of abating."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theroachsays,30,Sun May 31 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"I was disturbed by the level of language and viewpoint policing on some of the LGBT subs   It's definitely gotten ridiculous. I used to visit those subs and I would be afraid to go back to them now. A quick peak into r/lgbt and I see that they want you to censor things that might be triggering with a spoiler tag. Even back when I was on them I saw some of this policing. I just think that's childish and that we don't need to baby people.  People take this SJW stuff seriously. We make fun of it in TiA and discuss it here, but there are people who are really taking in what the SJWs are pushing and applying it to their lives. If I'm ever single again, I'm actually afraid of going into the gay dating world because there are so many gay women who align themselves with this and don't think it's completely ridiculous. While I'm very outspoken online, I really hate arguing about this stuff in person so I would feel really awkward defending my point of view.  But I swear if I ever encounter someone in real life who asks me to call them xhe instead of he/she, I'm going to laugh in their face. If they ask me to call them ""they"", that's fine. but anything made up, nope.  And it's sad, because you want to go there to support marriage equality, but if you don't support the rest of the nonsense, you're considered the jerk."

That's just how I talk. I got tired of getting my posts deleted for it, so fuck that noise.   I get that they want to discourage people from using gender slurs, but it's not like I was going in there calling the women cunts and bitches. You can definitely tell a difference, but they just automatically deleted any post that had the word ""bitch"" in it without reading the context.  Why not just go full out and not allow curse words?

Almost every political opinion expressed is liberal and hating SJWs for the damage they do to progressivism. People don't like feminism, but the idea that ""people can only dislike feminism if they are horrible reactionaries who should not be talking!"" is why feminists and SJWs are so utterly terrible. If you don't count ""dislikes feminism"" as ""reactionary"", which you shouldn't, then calling TiA ""reactionary"" is a completely indefensible position."

I see conservative opinions everywhere!"" proclamations always seem to be falling into the same ultimate fallacy that drives SJWs, the idea that because your opinions are Correct, people who disagree with them should not be listened to. Just the fact that an opinion is conservative is sometimes used as proof that too many of The Wrong People are allowed to speak, and all of TiA is being destroyed.  Not only are conservatives, even reactionaries, actual people with their own internally-consistent worldview that says conservatism/reaction...ology is the way to achieve goals we all value, but they are incredibly, incredibly important to functioning liberalism!  If you listen to the far-right, they talk about history as an inevitable and extended slide into liberalism -- the phrase is something like ""Cthulhu may swim slowly, but he only swims to the left"". They view this as unreason slowly nibbling at the foundations of society; liberals view this as a heroic ongoing struggle against the forces of oppression. Each of those totally ignores the importance of the other side.  All of our really good political ideas come from the left. All of our gobsmackingly terrible political ideas come from the left too. The left is not capable of telling those apart. The right is the domain of barely-tolerable but proven-to-function ideas and systems. Their job is to say ""No, that is a stupid idea, we're not doing that, I don't care how mean you think I'm being,"" and only get dragged into changing things when they've obviously been shown to be wrong. It is an adversarial system, like having a prosecutor and defense attorney. You can't get rid of either of those roles.  What happens when you say conservatives are always wrong and shouldn't be listened to? You get SJWs. People who have left rationality behind, who can't make a coherent argument beyond spewing emotionally charged words, who have utterly disconnected the part of their brain that asks ""Hey, is this a good idea?"" so they could devote more power to the part that says ""I'm showing off what a good, tolerant, virtuous person I am! I get to be a bully to everyone else and feel great about it!""  It's hard not to drink the Kool-Aid when nobody else is allowed to offer a competing flavor."

One of the closing statements on their tumblr was that this was a place for them to play around and feel like they were interacting with the outside world, and that they just wanted to be left alone to do that.  The amount of hatred it got was borderline psychotic, and I genuinely felt bad for the kid. Worst off, if memory serves, they deleted the blog shortly after.  The worst of us bullied a lonely, isolated kid out of their sandbox because we didn't like the sandcastles they were building. It was honestly fucked up.

It was this weird cultish family group and the leader was called Wolf and a bunch of the other guys were named after different types of wolves (Timber Wolf, etc...). One of the guys though insisted on being called Oni and said that he was half demon and half angel and shit. Normally I'd say that it was all in good fun and they were just weird. It was the Philly goth scene, and hardly the strangest thing to come out of it. But they were all adult men in their late twenties who hung out at this all-ages club and would target teenage girls.  One of my best friends wound up wrapped up in this fucked up cult. This Oni guy told her that she was special and that he could see that she had a different spirit in her or something and she became one of a handful of teenage girls he'd have over to have sex with and to do his housework.  When I see otherkin on tumblr now, they're mostly teenage kids who feel different (like pretty much any teenager) and they're trying to sort themselves out. I cringe and often think it's really dumb, but it's more or less harmless and I think it's preferable to the kin I ran into before tumblr."

It's simply easier to paint with a broad brush sometimes and cede exceptions, than to front-load exceptions, end up missing some special case anyways, and gain no real benefit from it.

Feminism in 2015 is fucked up and anyone who doesn't see it is trying to cling to the past.  EDIT: Also, it seems like even the ""good"" feminists are guilty of bullshit like the abortion debate. They keep framing it as a war of the genders, saying things like ""do you want these men having a say in your body?"" As if there's no women who are against abortion. As if there's no women at pro-life rallies, as if there's no Chinese Catholics or Arab Muslims or Black Christians who are opposed to it for religious, ethical, or even scientific reasons.

For perspective, if the top 10 countries by size of military mobilized their entire active, reserve, militia, and paramilitary forces, they would barely reach 1/3rd of Gawker's audience.  If it seems like rational people are drowned out in a sea of hysterical, shrill voices, it's because they are.

TiADiscussion,380dbw,heartjuice,27,Mon Jun 1 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"I think few people would argue with the point that there are reasonable feminists out there. The question is, how representative are they? The vast majority of young people in the West, and English-speaking people on the Internet, seem to support the idea of equal of opportunity and equality in the eyes of the law, and indeed legally-speaking men and women are pretty much equal in most Western countries. This makes the feminist label a bit redundant unless you're of the opinion that things need to go further (not you personally, but people in general).  I have friends IRL who identify as feminists and whilst I get on okay with them, and they can sometimes be reasonable, most of them are pretty social justice warriory in their views. They espouse the concepts of safe spaces everywhere and trigger warnings on everything; they view racism and sexism entirely within the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy; they're fully on-board with the whole 'rape culture' is a major problem thing, and probably feel the same way about the wage gap; they see gender as a social construct (with the exception of trans people, I guess, sort of?), and they're devout anti-capitalists.  Now, I concede that women do still face some problems, such as harassment and discrimination, but I don't think those problems are anywhere near as bad as many self-identifying feminists seem to think they are. Out of curiosity, why do you feel the need to identify as a feminist, instead of, say, the more neutral egalitarian?"

It's woefully misused and often laughably wrong in context. Absence of evidence absolutely is evidence of absence when evidence should be present.  For example: It's winter, a friend calls you and tells you he saw someone sneaking around your home looking in your windows. You look outside, and there's no evidence of anyone having been around your house: the snow is crisp and even with no footprints or any sort of disturbance. Absence of evidence, evidence of absence.  People seem to forget that Donald Rumsfeld used that phrase while actively lying to the world about reasons for going into Iraq. Memories are short, it seems.  Edit As to the OP's statement of ""I don't hear any feminist"", it's a legitimate statement... we don't hear any of those feminists, because feminists who oppose that get crushed underfoot or simply buried by the commentariat and nodding masses. It's not enough that some random one-of blogspotter says ""that's not nice"". Until someone with juice, or sufficient someones enough to exert collective juice, make a point of counteracting the misandry-for-hire feminist cults of personality, they're the exclusive public face of modern feminism, like it or not."

Similarly, if a store has cameras pointed at their cash register and a store clerk accuses me of robbing him at gunpoint and reaching into the till, when I am found to not be present on any CCTV footage, that too is evidence -- that the store clerk is lying.   People seem to forget that Donald Rumsfeld used that phrase while actively lying to the world about reasons for going into Iraq. Memories are short, it seems.   And?   Until someone with juice, or sufficient someones enough to exert collective juice, make a point of counteracting the misandry-for-hire feminist cults of personality, they're the exclusive public face of modern feminism, like it or not.   Agreed."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,heartjuice,11,Mon Jun 1 16:12:39 2015 UTC,"The point is that in many cases where that phrase is used, absence of evidence is evidence of absence. Much like your ""mmm no"", it's a distinction without a difference - there's no evidence of someone being around your house in that case equates to evidence that noone has been around your house.  Not that it matters much in this context, as the original point is that even if there are voices in opposition, they're essentially meaningless bytes thrown into a maelstrom of counter-opinion by people with vastly greater numbers of eyeballs, and corresponding ""me too"" shitposts that drown out any dissent.   And?   ... and anything uttered by someone who is actively trying to lie to you should be held as suspect, even if it's glib.   Agreed.   Hence the reason for the pushback: the kind of feminists like the type my mom used to be are wholly ineffectual in preventing the runaway hate train, so some other force has to come into play to balance things. Sadly, that balance will likely come in a newtonian form of ""equal and opposite"" rather than a transcendent form of something that lets us outgrow feminism and leave it behind, like finally moving out of the basement of your well-meaning but suffocating bubble-wrap parents' home. I suggest that TiA's current state is an echo, or perhaps an early warning of that.  Edit: one too many 'finally's in the last paragraph"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,ShitArchonXPR,2,Mon Jun 1 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"The point is that in many cases where that phrase is used, absence of evidence is evidence of absence. Much like your ""mmm no"", it's a distinction without a difference - there's no evidence of someone being around your house in that case equates to evidence that noone has been around your house.   Not really. In any biconditional statement -- such as ""either there was somebody around your house or there was not"" -- one need only prove one part of the statement true to prove the other false. If I can prove that nobody was around my house -- such as by the lack of tracks and the lack of a person's ability to levitate -- by proving that nobody has been around my house is true, I have proven that somebody lurking around my house is false. Anything else violates the law of non-contradiction; something cannot both be and not be at the same time.  Put more succinctly, ""If somebody has been around my house, the snow will be disturbed. The snow is not disturbed. Therefore nobody has been around my house.""  The criticism of ""absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"" is the rightly calling out of argument from ignorance fallacy. The difference between seeking out and finding contradictory evidence -- whether it's undisturbed snow or feminists shouting down the Gawker network -- and simply claiming that because one has not seen it that it does not exist is a stark and glaring difference.  The better analogy is being told that a prowler's been outside your house, not being bothered to check to see if the snow's been disturbed, and then simply saying ""I see no footprints""."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,Love_and_PeaceII,15,Mon Jun 1 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think genderqueer is a thing   Non-male/female genders are a well-established thing across the world. Whether ""genderqueer"" is a useful framework of discussion or whatever is obviously subject to debate, but there have always been societies that played around with gender roles or rejected a gender binary.   Feminism, as it stands with the current crop, is utterly batshit.   Have you read any academic feminist books? Part of the problem of TiA is that it only sees shoddy, reductive, garbled versions of complex concepts.  One Two"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,Sordak,2,Mon Jun 1 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"As someone who calls themselves a feminist despite not being all about the feminism that is spewed out on Tumblr, I 100% agree about that. I'm about the feminism of the individual in which we are all seen as our own people rather than an agenda, a statistic, or a subhuman.   However, because I call myself a feminist, I'm a misandry practicing evil succubus. And that bothers me because there's I think that there's more than one type of feminism out there and I've been vehemently against misandry for years."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,nothin_incriminating,15,Wed Jun 3 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're getting at. I've lurked TiA since it was just shy of 1000 subs (on another account - attempted doxxings are not fun lemmetellya) and I guess I registered that things are changing but never really noticed it. I've been on the internet way too goddamn long, so when the internet at large's culture/language/attitude changes I try not to get all hipster about it and just roll with it. I think the internet changed again recently - other commenters have noticed it too: TiA's subject matter suddenly exploded and went into the mainstream. The term ""social justice warrior"" entered the public consciousness. The sub was no longer just for people who felt ostracized by extremism and wanted a place to discuss it and laugh at the crazies - now the average (internet-savvy) joe is tied up in that affair and has a stake in it. I never imagined that TiA would get to the size it is today, and I guess I never really asked myself why it grew so large in popularity until it started regularly penetrating my /r/all.  With the horde came, well, the horde - not to sound patronizing, but when the general internet populace speaks, it does so in the lowest common denominator. Gone are TiA's ideological discussions and in come the dank maymays. You mentioned that you feel that the sub has become reactionary. I don't feel that its views have changed like that, but its language and attitude have certainly come a long way from that they were at the beginning. I feel the sub hasn't become bigoted or reactionary, but it's definitely become more pushy or ""in your face"" (not sure how else to describe it) since it started. Many submission titles, much of the comments...they just exude that aforementioned lowest common denominator of modern internet culture. Half the titles are just quotes or paraphrases from the post itself presented as a sort of smug single line of greentext that you'd feel would be accompanied by a similarly smug reaction image (or hyperliked with an imgur upload of that image since we're on reddit). The comments? Well, you seem to have gotten the idea - if I ever discover a way to convert dank memes into energy, a single TiA comment thread would probably be able to power New York for a month. That's just what the internet looks like nowadays, y'know? Loud, boisterous, and in your face are the fashion of the day. And with recent events drawing more and more average internet users to TiA...I mean, could we ever really expect people to leave all that crap at the door?  It's not at all a shock to me. This happens to every internet community that gets big. I know. I've been here too long. I've seen enough Eternal Septembers to know that August is never as long as it deserves to be. Do I miss old TiA? Of course I do - I'd be a damned liar if I said I didn't prefer it to what we have now (hell, you probably miss it even more, seeing as it's your baby after all), but at the same time I still like the sub as it is today. It's not perfect. It may very well be a shadow of its old self. It's often silly and obnoxious. But behind all that...its soul, the ideas and intentions that it started with...I feel that they're still there. You mentioned that you used to be able to laugh off accusations of bigotry since they were so markedly untrue...well, for me that's still the case: if this place has one thing going for it it's that it's quite literally the only non-explicitly-trans-related place I go to where I feel 100% accepted and supported at all times, and that has been a solid and unwavering constant in all my years here, something that, despite the sub's supposed downfall into hatred, still stands strong today.  I still like TiA. It's still my favorite sub. I don't feel like it's gone or lost. I know this isn't its finest hour. But I also know that this too shall pass. SJWs are having their moment in the sun, and by extension their opposites - the (very real) monsters they claim to fight against - will join them there, serving as the opposite pole for this internet culture war. But eventually, like all things, their time will be over. The internet will find something else to fight about. SJWs will go back to tumblr, and dickheads will go back to TRP (or wherever - I don't know how they work), both satisfied that they've won. And then we can go back to being us...maybe October will finally come. And I don't mind waiting for that day. Maybe that's just wide-eyed optimism. I don't know. I already accidentally an essay and It's 5 am. I really shouldn't be operating a keyboard."

TiADiscussion,380dbw,MittRomneysCampaign,18,Mon Jun 1 02:33:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with your description, though not your prescription.  As a moderate, I hate extremists of both sides.  Whether it is the hardcore conservatives of the bible belt, or the hypocritical SJWs that you see on TiA, I have a deep antipathy toward either side of the extremism spectrum, and I feel that all extremists must go.  However, I do have the benefit of being a bit older and more experienced than you, and if there is one piece of wisdom that I have learned from it, it's that you can't fight radicals with ambivalence.  Moderates can't stand up to extremists because extremists are crazy enough to do anything to further their goals, and moderates simply don't have the kind of dedication needed to stand up against such fanatics.  In order to fight that kind of extremism, you need to cultivate a different kind of extremism.  If you want to fight a man with an attack dog, it's important to have attack dogs of your own.  And that's the purpose TiA will serve.  Sure, the sub has degenerated into a bunch of fanatical extremists, and I haven't bothered reading it in a long time.  But one day those extremists will become productive members of society who vote, and influence other people.  And when those people get to that point, they will stomp nine kinds of bullshit out of those SJW extremists.  And eventually we'll need to do something about the anti-SJW extremists to stop them from going too far.  Maybe we'll need to start an anti-anti-SJW movement.  My point is that the pendulum has currently swung too far in the direction of the SJWs, and so some extra effort is needed to tip the balance back.  Once we get to that point, we can have a discussion about finding a reasonable balance.  But I just don't think we're there quite yet.  Let's allow our crazy fanatics to fight their crazy fanatics, and once the lunatics on both sides have totally cut each other down and the moderates are the only ones with any credibility, we can discuss finding some reasonable equilibrium.  Regardless, I'm sorry you feel bad about TiA.  You always seemed like a pretty cool guy, EFS, and I feel sad that you are disappointed in how things turned out."

TiADiscussion,380dbw,jasa159,5,Mon Jun 1 05:15:44 2015 UTC,"/u/ArchangelleBorgore, I'm very sorry to hear that you hate what the community you created has become. For my part, I've only been on TiA for the last... maybe 7 months? I really wouldn't consider myself a bigoted or hateful person. I frequent TiA simply because I find SJWs endlessly frustrating, and I really dislike the way their mentality (dumb wage gap statistics etc) has leaked onto my social media in a major way (most of my Facebook friends are quite left-leaning). For me, TiA is the only place where I don't have to worry about being super-politically correct all the time, and I highly appreciate its existence for that. I would have to disagree that it's full of hatred and resentment and bitterness - I think, as others have commented, that its members are simply expressing understandable frustration at the mainstream traction SJWs and their beliefs seem to be gaining. Light-heartedness is naturally going to become a bit more scarce when it's no longer a fringe group of weirdos you're dealing with.  It truly makes me sad whenever I see TiA referred to outside of the sub as a community of bigots. Sure, there are a few bigots in it, as is inevitable for any large group, and I'll admit that I don't necessarily like or agree with everything that's posted, or with the hivemind opinion on every issue, but I really do believe that the majority of TiA regulars are open-minded sorts who are simply airing their frustrations in the form of rants/sarcasm/toucan jokes. Any genuine closed-mindedness/bigotry is generally shot down quite quickly. If anything, TiA is MORE moderate and open-minded than certain other subs I browse that appear to be quite accepting, but then downvote you to hell for simply stating that feminism and egalitarianism are not the same thing. So I'm not sure if I and those who are accusing TiA of bigotry are reading completely threads or if we just have different definitions of the word ""bigotry"".  Anyway, sorry for the long post. I just wanted to offer my perspective as a current regular of the sub."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,piper06w,9,Thu Jun 4 09:27:43 2015 UTC,"You have no place in TiA if you don't follow the correct political circlejerk.   That's how I feel about a lot of these sorts of subreddits. Any slightly varying opinion is downvoted. And the hivemind of these subreddits are too narrow. Any main sub has it's own hivemind, but there are lots of people out there who don't align to it. r/politics, r/atheism, r/childfree r/feminism ... all of these and more have a very specific hivemind, when really not every person aligns themselves to those same opinions. But if you dare to post your varying one, you'll get flamed to hell and back.  I used to follow r/justneckbeardthings until I realized it was actually filled with feminists making fun of neckbeards. I used to follow TiA (and still do on this account). And while I tend to align against feminists, especially SJWs, I still think that the hivemind of the subreddit has taken a nosedive from even when I started following it. I still follow r/childfree but a lot of the users there have been driven to r/truechildfree because they couldn't stand the pure hatred coming from the main subreddit.  I also found TiA made (and still makes) me more hateful of people who aligned themselves with feminism or any current activism movement. I even had a huge argument with my best friend because she was the sort of person who posted those hash tag trends and info graphs about white privilege. And even though we had drifted apart prior, instead of us finding a middle ground, we haven't spoken since then. Instead of just seeing her for what she was, I had months of hatred from TiA speaking for me. And while I don't think I was wrong, I think I might have been less hostile if I hadn't been subbed to TiA.  I think some ""social justice"" movements bring up some good points, but then I think they take it too far. TiA used to mock just the ones who took it too far, but now it just seems to align itself against all ""social justice"" movements. You used to see people commenting that a movement sort of had a point and that comment would get upvotes, but I haven't seen that in a really long time. I think some people are too scared too post that now.  I'm honestly at the point where I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of the feminists, the SJWs, the MRAs, TRPers, and anyone in between who bothers to express their opinion on it. I'm really just sick of arguing and everyone arguing and no one bothering to see someone else's side because their head is too far up their own ass to even consider anything else. I came back on this account and have been on TiA some since then, but I don't think it'll take long for me to get sick of the hivemind and the arguing again.  Thanks for sharing your opinion. It's interesting to read commentary from the creator of a subreddit on how their subreddit has changed.  (I didn't finish the links for the subreddits since I wasn't sure if that was allowed or if either sub would want tlinked traffic, but you can easily type in each one if you want to visit it.)"
TiADiscussion,380dbw,Rynthion,8,Mon Jun 1 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"I used to like /r/childfree but it has the opposite problem of TiA, it's full of SJWs and you will get downvoted if you don't tow that line. And yeah it's just circlejerking about how horrible kids are instead of enjoying life without them, it's the same as /r/MGTOW hating women instead of focusing on actually doing your own thing. /r/childfree is just the women's version of MGTOW and they're both horrible circlejerks."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,IrrationalShark,2,Mon Jun 1 10:36:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't remember if I've seen that in r/childfree. You're probably right though. There are lots of stories on CF about how men get trapped into having babies because the woman lied about birth conrol that you'd think feminists would realize something is wrong with the system here, but instead, they probably just have a downvote brigade on anyone that points that out. Hell, could have happened to me and I just don't remember.   I always try to caution the guys there to protect themselves and get a vasectomy or use their own protection because even though they want to, they really just shouldn't trust their partners when they are truly CF and want to remain that way. I've never been argued with for saying that, but there are a lot of stories where the man straight up got screwed because his gf got knocked up (questionable whether or not she deceived him) and didn't want to abort the little jelly bean so he's stuck being a father or paying child support. Never seen anyone point out how unfair that is though..."

And heh complain about the women deceiving men and not getting abortions and they'll probably label you as red pill.  Meanwhile MGTOW is basically the same thing as CF but it's men (CF is mostly women) circlejerking against feminists instead.  Reddit has just become a split of fucking gender politics."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theboyfromganymede,3,Mon Jun 1 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"And heh complain about the women deceiving men and not getting abortions and they'll probably label you as red pill.   Trust me, I've gotten that. Haven't ever been actually called a red piller, but I've gotten the arguments. I'm not even a man either. It is fucked up that women can entrap men like that, but the feminists don't consider what I'm saying, and I can't stand that. I had someone just argue with me over semantics because I said men lost rights because of this stuff. They kept asking me to list the exact rights lost, and I'm really bad at arguing stuff, so idk, maybe the right to not be legally entrapped by a woman just because they were deceived and she got pregnant? But nooo, the guy is still responsible for the woman going through with the pregnancy just because it's her body and she can financially entrap him for 18 years because it's perfectly legal for her to have a baby she can't afford to raise alone.  I hate this shit. It's one of the many things feminism implemented with no regard for men at all. Feminism has overstepped its boundaries, but none of the feminists will acknowledge it. It's why I can't stand the movement anymore, but nope, I'm apparently an enemy neckbeard TRPer for it, despite being a woman who has just seen the truth of things after many stories from men who have to remain silent about it. Feminism is too loud they'll just get flamed if they bring it up, even by people they know in real life."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,redditthrowawaykin,5,Mon Jun 1 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"The fundamental problem is feminists tend to view the issue as being about their bodies when in fact the actual issue is much bigger than that and indeed much more important than just them. And when you encounter the SJWs which are a sizeable proportion of /r/childfree's users then you will simply get nowhere trying to argue with them.  This is why you get people like Jessica Valenti hating on RISUG. Because they just don't want equality in this area. They'd rather maintain things that benefit them. Can't fucking wait for that shit to come out. I'm reminded of this. And yeah I'll probably get a vasectomy some time in the next few years, only problem is I have to get it done privately."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,theboyfromganymede,2,Mon Jun 1 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"That story was amusing. It's always fun to hear a guy get to tell a woman who was trying to deceive him that he's had a vasectomy. At the same time, with all the deceiving he did back to her, I don't think he's much above her. She deserved it, for sure, but it also brings him down to her level. He could have just let her stew for a few days and then told her. She definitely deserved it, but to do that makes him almost as scummy.   Because they just don't want equality in this area. They'd rather maintain things that benefit them.   That's all I can see from feminism today. I don't even know if they're pushing for real issues anymore. With the hostility I've encountered from feminists for simply being neutral, or even when I was on their side, I don't even really care to see if there is any legitimacy left to the movement. For the most party I consider it dead or unnecessary. It's done what it's needed to decades ago (and taken some liberties from men at that). Time to let it go."
TiADiscussion,380dbw,ClintHammer,4,Mon Jun 1 18:13:29 2015 UTC,Yeah he was a bit of a dick and in all honesty I think that story (if true) is dramaticised. But I don't think he was anywhere close to her level. No competition between what he did and trying to make someone pay to bring up someone else's baby.   For the most party I consider it dead or unnecessary. It's done what it's needed to decades ago   I agree with this. Generally the sane feminists are the one who just use the label to mean egalitarianism. I say popularise egalitarianism so those people go under that label and let there be no confusion. Let the SJWs have feminism.
TiADiscussion,380dbw,Namkcalb,2,Mon Jun 1 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"And yeah it's just circlejerking about how horrible kids are instead of enjoying life without them   To me, talking about encounters with someone's snotnosed infant nephew Braedynne isn't circlejerking--it's good, it's cathartic and interesting and stuff I wanna read--but the stuff about ""I hate those teenage brats and I absolutely can't be around a child for 5 seconds and we need to bring back more spanking"" (the sort of stuff Bridezilla posts on there with whatever her current reddit handle is--mandimoo458272something) is circlejerking.

That it and its slightly less cancerous forms are mocked, and not all that harshly either - you don't see anyone here doxxing them or sending them private messages to kill themselves, unlike what you may find on the other end of the aisle, isn't some great tragedy.

TiADiscussion,380dbw,auzzydawg,20,Mon Jun 1 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. As TiA gets clogged with posts and discourse better suited to FPH, TiAD has, as has been pointed out, devolved into posts about the trajectory of TiA, rather than about the political phenomenon it mocks. SJWism is grimly fascinating, and I miss being able to ruminate on it without associating it with the hateful parts of this community.  What I've always maintained is that SJWism is defined by its rhetoric, not the ideological content necessarily. But the posts that would be better suited elsewhere are those that have clearly been upvoted because subscribers disagree with the opinion expressed, rather than because its presentation lacks nuance, perspective, and empathy. That style of rhetoric is, as you said, found increasingly within TiA, hence all the two-sides-of-the-same-coin navel-gazing.  It might call for another sub, one just as willing to mock the same hysterical style when it comes from KiA (as it so often does). Maybe then the OG TiA community can gain traction across a wider political spectrum and devoted itself to mocking douchebaggery of every political bent."

TiADiscussion,380dbw,DigiDuncan,3,Mon Jun 1 01:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is that for as long as I can remember (I joined Reddit just for TiA, in late 2013, before the sub hit 50k) we've always had this same sort of accusation.  ""It's a circle jerk that hates feminism and love redpills and MRAs!""  And of course, since we tended to have more rational (if not always, more often than not at least) discussions when it came to differing view points.  It's hard to say there was none of it because when you talk about the problems with ""general"" feminism, or ""extreme"" feminism, the critiques frequently blend into criticism of feminists or ""all"" feminism.  There's always, with HAES, always been a twinge of FPH because out of all groups, fat people are probably even more acceptable to hate on than white people.  But generally, for the longest time the sub hasn't been openly hostile, though maybe not warmly welcoming, of feminism.  This did sort of change eventually.  It got too easy to speak in the general sense against ""feminists"" and even ""liberals"".  Too tempting to stop specifying ""these specific feminists"" after the 100th time.  Add in the ever growing numbers and events like ""gamergate"" and those that don't just see it as ""these specific feminists"" start showing up and feeling like they fit in perfectly, and when someone pulls the ol' ""not all feminists"" they're frequently beset upon by those who do believe all feminists, as well as those sick of hearing/having to say ""not all feminists"".  Despite the fact that ""Not all men"" will largely be defended to the death.  I don't think there was ever really any one big switch, though if there was it would almost certainly have been around GG.  I think it was a more subtle and slow change, with some people getting used to it, or having differing tolerance levels, so every time another ""TiA has changed"" or ""Stop hating on the feminists"" it was pretty easy to throw in the pile of ""wasn't true a year ago, still isn't true now"" pile.    Except, it kinda is true now.  In some ways it is simply the inevitability of a larger community.  In others it's also the inevitability of a sub made for the sake of pointing and laughing.  Even if meant as a less mean spirited and personally spiteful sort than something like FPH, there's still a bit of that.  I mean, a big part of the draw is to see what these people say and go ""lol ur dum"".  Having a smaller, slightly more personal community with active/deeper commentary than just ""lol ur dum"" was certainly had in the old days, and still occasionally pops up (I try to interject some when I can) but as the community grows and becomes much more impersonal those meaningful discussions end up rarer, and drowned out by the inane.  I also think part of the problem with repeated jokes is the repeated content.  So many stories for so long about that Goldsmith lady, all saying the same thing.  Then the ones about Sulcowicz (how's a man supposed to spell that name?!).  Don't even get me started on the damned dress code ones that seem to clearly all be tumblr users copying one another using damn near the same flyers at different schools across the country.  The repetitive nature also limits the meaningful discussions, because unless people start going around copy and pasting what they (or more likely someone else) says into each thread on the same topic, the discussion runs dry.  It's a dead horse, it's been discussed time and time again.  What's left but to make those same old silly jokes as we continue to point and laugh?  Those four things (larger community, events like gamergate making it more ""personal"", and repeated content/dead horses all leading into less actual discussion and more general pointing and laughing/cathartic outrage) kind of meld together into a storm of shit.  And before long it starts to turn it into that thing that not too long ago we were swearing it wasn't.  And really, I think some combination of those four things are a big killer/quality detriment to a lot of discussion boards.  People only have so much to say.  There's only so many varying view points.  At some point nearly all meaningful discussion there is to be had has been had (hell, we've had this ""TiA has changed"" discussion repeatedly already!), and it turns into this really weird, sad, and awkward conversation.  It's like those desperate attempts to fill ""awkward"" silences where you're just sitting there with someone else not saying anything because everything worth saying has already been said, so we tell old jokes again and again to fill that silence."

The same goes for any moderate issue. It seems to have become this backlash against ideas entirely. It used to be making fun of ridiculous triggers, now it is making fun of them even existing.  It used to make fun of radical feminists but then it become a hate of all forms of femininst.   I once stood up for this community but i can't anymore.

That isn't reasonable at all.   TiA prided ourselves on hardly ever having to get involved because the community sorted shitty posts out itself   It doesn't have to get involved. It better not go the direction of SRS modding...   TRP and FPH have become two of the fastest growing subreddits.    The red pill is still a pretty insignificant corner of reddit.

Remember, the reason why people are rabidly against SJWs is because they don't like the SJWs' tone and extreme views. The best thing you can do is to be patient, acknowledge his views, gently correct him, and demonstrate through your actions that you are different from an SJW. In other words, you make it your duty to educate him- SJWs are famous for saying ""it's not my duty to educate you"". Make sure you have a good tone throughout- the key marker of an SJW is the angry, militant tone when there has been absolutely nothing offensive done or said. People are much more responsive when you are willing to listen and to understand.  That being said, if the reason why he hates SJWs is because he has extreme views himself (a la Red Pill), then you have another problem entirely."

It's possible that this guy was just getting hot-headed and isn't actually an extremist but it's hard to tell without actually being there.

Don't be mad, the likely cause is that they lack the imagination to comprehend the benefits. The next most probable is that they are using it as a way of not acknowledging their own unearned privileges. (What I mean by the latter is that people often feel guilt over how good they have it, and create ways that they deserve it in order to rationalise it.)  If you feel that you must educate him, start by focusing on the ways he's discriminated against. Then try to put him in the shoes of other people facing serious discrimination, then the more low-level stuff encountered in the West.

You're mistaking his beliefs as leaning in the other direction. They don't. His beliefs lie in the exact same direction as SJWs.  Your mistake is in assuming that if you get mugged by somebody who's pro-skub in January and then mugged by somebody who's anti-skub in June that there views on skub had anything to do with it. It's not that they held opposing views on skub, it's that they held identical views on their entitlement to assault and mug people.

For me the only equality I advocate is equality before the law - equality of opportunity, but due to classical liberal reasons (about freedom) not due to support for equality for its own sake. I oppose SJW in part because they advocate equality of outcome or worse, inequality against 'privileged' people, that and many other horrible things they do, their terrible ideology, etc, and how its encroaching, as well as opposition to the radical left.   So if theres a political project or ideology promoting 'fairness', because fairness is subjective and is often used to justify equality of outcome, I'd be opposed to the 'fairness' advocated.   The SJWs, as bad as they are, were merely a backlash against misogyny, homo/transphobia, etc in our mainstream society.    No. Those things are not mainstream, but a few isolated hateful bigots. SJWs are not merely a reaction, they are advocates and followers of a toxic and flawed radical left ideology 'positively' advocating certain things. They are the opposite of reactionaries, they are advocating a poisonous 'progress' that is progress towards something that would damage society. Their ideas are an unintelllectual bastardization of allreach terribly flawed ideas from the radical left - which already was poisonous - fed by the internet and social media, and young minds uncritical minds being brainwashed with radical leftist ideas they don't understand at university, and in turn promoting it.    but that doesn't mean that the ones who hate them are all fine and dandy people.   Hate is never a good thing, but there are many who are strongly opposed to SJWs who actually don't hate them.    SJWs don't have nearly the power as a combined coalition of the religious right and business interests   Look up Soros, people from the super rich like him actually support the radical left a lot of the time.

But I'm reminded of a quote criticizing that notion: ""The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.""  Of course, there are those who oppose even equality under the law, and they should be excoriated. But often there needs to be a bit more than that to ensure economic prosperity and wealth for everyone. Equality of outcome shouldn't be the goal, but inequality of opportunity is a worse and is the more relevant problem today around the world. The SJWs are, in this sense, less of a threat than those who want to keep their special privileges that others do not have.

Certainly not as high as it is today. Do you remember the ""no  dogs, no blacks, no Irish"" signs in Britain immediately after WWII? A change in social attitudes, brought on by social justice activists (NOT SJWs) changed that. SJWs are just their more extreme, less helpful cousin, who harm those they intend to help and makes the rest of the social justice movement look bad.   Hate is never a good thing, but there are many who are strongly opposed to SJWs who actually don't hate them.   True, but opposition to SJWs can come from many different angles. Not everyone who isn't an SJW is any better than an SJW.   Look up Soros, people from the super rich like him actually support the radical left a lot of the time.

The religious right and big business aren't NATURAL allies, but in the United States, they are forced into an alliance because the same politicians that support the religious right are the same ones that subsidize and give goodies to big business. True, the Koch brothers are not religious conservatives. But they rely on the religious conservative vote to elect their favorite politicians, and that is where you get the unnatural alliance."

Do you remember the ""no dogs, no blacks, no Irish"" signs in Britain immediately after WWII?    Oh no that was the inevitable result of technological advance, the enlighenment, religion losing sway, and things like contraception. It wasn't due to social justice advocates.    A change in social attitudes, brought on by social justice activists (NOT SJWs) changed that. SJWs are just their more extreme, less helpful cousin, who harm those they intend to help and makes the rest of the social justice movement look bad.   No the concept of social justice is totally nonsensical and only causes problems. Justice is not something that can be applied to society, justice is a matter of law - courts etc - not society.    Not everyone who isn't an SJW is any better than an SJW.   Yeah, but most are not as bad as SJWs, and its SJWs who, in the world of ideas, are gaining the most ground.   The religious right and big business aren't NATURAL allies, but in the United States, they are forced into an alliance because the same politicians that support the religious right are the same ones that subsidize and give goodies to big business. True, the Koch brothers are not religious conservatives.    There are big business and super rich people funding both sides of partisan politics, and the Koch brothers aren't even big plays in that relative to some. And in the symbiotic relationship between corporatism and the state, you may not realize it, but the state is more dominant."
TiADiscussion,37xglq,hfwang18,4,Sun May 31 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"Free markets are what would deliver that, unlike the awful corporatist-statist mixed economy that dominates now.   Back when markets were ""freer"", at the turn of the 20th century, there was actually LESS prosperity for the average person. Why was that? Very few markets in the real world are perfectly competitive, and monopolies were in vogue. A monopoly in the product market means a monopsony in the labor market, leading to lower wages. Only antitrust laws, enacted by the government to promote competition (in most firms), and pro-union legislation allowing for a neutralization of market power by the more concentrated firms, made for better times for the average person.  That being said, there were some things, because of their high fixed/entry costs, that would actually lead to more waste if they were competitive (utilities, roads, etc), and so the government regulated them to make sure they did not charge monopoly prices and lead to deadweight loss of welfare. It isn't perfect, but that's how economics in the real world, instead of the fantasy free market libertarian world, works.  You should really brush up on your economics...the Austrian school is thoroughly discredited, and the neoliberal and monetarist schools are also on their way back out. Markets don't always work efficiently on their own...and that's where government comes in. I'm working on an economics degree myself, and the imperfections of markets are a major topic.   For all the flaws of modern western society, in Europe and North America inequality of outcome just isn't a big problem at all. Its the deveping world where its more of an issue.   The trend is towards increasing social equality but decreasing economic equality. The decreasing economic equality, however, will lead to, at some point, decreasing social equality as some people will end up losing out on opportunities because of the poor background that they were born into. This is what happened in the early 20th century, prior to the Great Depression and the rise of Keynesianism.   The special privileges that coproations have from the state, and other problems caused by the state, are an issue, but in terms of the world of ideas, the niggest encroaching danger is the radical left, and most of all SJWs among the radical left.   The SJWs don't have political power, and will not because they are unpopular. What IS popular is conservative populism in rural areas of both the US and UK, and conservative populist politicians are the ones who give goodies to the corporations. You don't seem to understand the state of politics in your own or in my country today.   Oh no that was the inevitable result of technological advance, the enlighenment, religion losing sway, and things like contraception. It wasn't due to social justice advocates.   The Enlightenment was in part a social justice movement, because it called for the equal dignity of all people. Religion losing sway was another outgrowth of the Enlightenment, as reason and rationality are now valued over religious dogma.   Yeah, but most are not as bad as SJWs, and its SJWs who, in the world of ideas, are gaining the most ground.   Only in colleges and universities, and even then among a small portion of the population. Most people aren't exposed to SJWs nor are affected by them. They poison any cause they touch and make them less popular.   There are big business and super rich people funding both sides of partisan politics, and the Koch brothers aren't even big plays in that relative to some. And in the symbiotic relationship between corporatism and the state, you may not realize it, but the state is more dominant.   They're doing that to hedge their bets, but they typically prefer the party that will give them lower taxes, less regulation, etc. and those are generally conservative parties. They donate to the center-left parties to keep them from going off the deep end, and for the most part it works- the Labour Party of Britain is not socialist anymore, and the Democrats in the US, when in office, are only slightly to the left of the Tories. And in the relationship between corporation and state, corporations are dominant, because they corrupt the state to benefit themselves, not the other way around."

Almost no taxation, no corporations with special privileges like limited liability from the state? No, it was not a free market.   there was actually LESS prosperity for the average person   Well economically things were improving more rapidly, as they had been throughout the industrial revolution. Things were beginning to turn though, because the trend towards more interventionism and proactive central banks was beginning.    Very few markets in the real world are perfectly competitive   Because we have a global corporatist mixed economy.    and monopolies were in vogue   The statist-corporatist mixed economy that has predominated since around the 1600’s tends towards oligopoly, and when the state gets involved, it can create an artificial monopoly – like the state monopolized coal industry in 1970 Britain.    A monopoly in the product market means a monopsony in the labor market, leading to lower wages.    Monopolies are rarer in more open markets, and tend to be temporary and benign. Inevitably they lose market share to more competitive innovative small companies with new technology or better business models. And anyway, prices relative to living costs would fall in a free market – leading to higher living standards which would more that compensate for a rare monopsony.    Only antitrust laws, enacted by the government to promote competition    They actually undermine competition and interfere with business, holding it back with red tape. The idea that state regulations promote completion is laughable, state beurocrats have no idea whats best for business, and have no incentives to.    so the government regulated them to make sure they did not charge monopoly prices and lead to deadweight loss of welfare   You believe all the myths about the wonderful benign state managing society don’t you?   the Austrian school is thoroughly discredited   The fact that mainstream economists have moved away from Austrian insights is only undermining it as a discipline. The Austrians don’t believe in homoeconomus like they do – but bounded rationality instead. The Austrians are progressive explaining more and more about the economy and mainstream economists are fools if they ignore it. Mainstream economists were mistaken to abandon says law – supply does create its own demand, and attempts by states to artificially increase demand only cause problems.    and the neoliberal and monetarist schools   Austrians are not neoliberals. The neoliberals were those that Mises accused of being ‘all a bunch of socialists’ – they wanted to optimize capitalism with the state, and monetarists were among them, sicne monetarists want micromanaging of interest rates to increase demand and consumption.    Markets don't always work efficiently on their own   They are not perfect, but they usually work optimally, and state always are inferior in part because of the economic calculation problem, among other problems. Allowing the emergent order of markets to flourish is far better than trying to use state power to control the economy from above. Keyes won the debate not because he was right but because of his charisma and rhetoric. Also keep in mind the Austrian resurgence…   The trend is towards increasing social equality but decreasing economic equality.   As long as the bottom bar increases its all good – as rising tide brings all up.    The decreasing economic equality, however, will lead to, at some point, decreasing social equality as some people will end up losing out on opportunities because of the poor background that they were born into.    As I explained poverty would be solved by a free market due to the fact that central banks increase prices artificially by expanding the money supply, and without that prices relative to incomes would fall, that and free market prosperity with the crashes and lower growth caused by states, would lead to poverty eventually disappearing.    The SJWs don't have political power   They are already infecting the media and academia, and there are probably quite a few in the democrats, the Labour party, the lib dems, and I’ve met some SJW leaning wets among the tories.    What IS popular is conservative populism    Both sides of the partisan political spectrum are part of the problem. That’s a separate issue from SJWs though.   The Enlightenment was in part a social justice movement   No it really wasn’t, it was fundamentally about freedom from not freedom to.   Only in colleges and universities, and even then among a small portion of the population.   Even the supposedly right wing Telegraph there are some journalists demonizing gamergate and taking the SJW’s side.    Most people aren't exposed to SJWs nor are affected by them.    It filters through such that people don’t realize they are becoming SJW-lite. That’s what political correctness is.    They're doing that to hedge their bets, but they typically prefer the party that will give them lower taxes, less regulation, etc. and those are generally conservative parties.    No what they want is centrism, more of the status quo, and an environment whereby they can succeed by getting subsidy and privileges and favouritism from the state.   And in the relationship between corporation and state, corporations are dominant   Corporations are part of the sphere of the state, and in a way, are part of the state, since their ologiopoly position, their very existence, and all their pricilges, are due t the state giving them.

Almost no taxation, no corporations with special privileges like limited liability from the state? No, it was not a free market.   You and your No True Scotsman game. I used to play it back when I was a libertarian. There was very little taxation on the wealthy and corporations prior to the 20th century, and corporations were existent since the 17th century. The reason why it was not a free market was because there are not a large number of both buyers and sellers, perfect information, no entry/exit costs, perfect rationality, etc. etc. etc., and there will never be, because there will never be perfect information, perfect rationality, nil entry/exit costs, or an infinite number of buyers and sellers. You are flying in the face of the economics definition of a free market here.   Well economically things were improving more rapidly, as they had been throughout the industrial revolution. Things were beginning to turn though, because the trend towards more interventionism and proactive central banks was beginning.   You got the order reversed. It was in response to poor living standards that interventionism began. Interventionism was not a major part of modern economies until the 20th century, long after the sharp rise in inequality and stagnation of living standards for average people.   The statist-corporatist mixed economy that has predominated since around the 1600’s tends towards oligopoly, and when the state gets involved, it can create an artificial monopoly – like the state monopolized coal industry in 1970 Britain.   It tends to oligopoly because bigger corporations can take advantage of economies of scale to beat their small competitors. Oligopolies, however, charge higher prices than what would be the case for perfectly competitive firms, and so the government had to step in to regulate. The government isn't perfect at regulating things, but it beats the alternative.   Monopolies are rarer in more open markets, and tend to be temporary and benign. Inevitably they lose market share to more competitive innovative small companies with new technology or better business models. And anyway, prices relative to living costs would fall in a free market – leading to higher living standards which would more that compensate for a rare monopsony.   Incorrect. Monopolies, when faced with competition, undercut their rivals' prices until they go out of business. That's how Standard Oil retained its monopoly for so long. They also take advantage of bigger economies of scale to lower costs, and can charge higher prices with less competition. They are not that easy to knock down.   They actually undermine competition and interfere with business, holding it back with red tape. The idea that state regulations promote completion is laughable, state beurocrats have no idea whats best for business, and have no incentives to.   Nobody should care about ""what is best for business"". What is best for business is not what is best for the macroeconomy, and state regulations can and do help with the macroeconomy by breaking up monopolies to promote competition in industries where they are appropriate, as judged by fixed costs vs. variable costs.   You believe all the myths about the wonderful benign state managing society don’t you?   States have managed societies for hundreds of years. They replaced the much worse alternative, feudal lords (in effect large business owners and governments combined, with their manor as their property, which was not protected by state power and thus were constantly under attack from other feudal lords), and have done an increasingly good job up to now.   They are not perfect, but they usually work optimally, and state always are inferior in part because of the economic calculation problem, among other problems. Allowing the emergent order of markets to flourish is far better than trying to use state power to control the economy from above. Keyes won the debate not because he was right but because of his charisma and rhetoric. Also keep in mind the Austrian resurgence…   You are confusing regulation with socialism. Regulation is introducing adjustments to the market to drive them towards optimal conditions. Socialism is abolishing markets entirely for central command. And Austrian economics is not predominant in economic circles today, precisely because they have recognized the problems with it.   They are already infecting the media and academia, and there are probably quite a few in the democrats, the Labour party, the lib dems, and I’ve met some SJW leaning wets among the tories.   Sure. Doesn't mean that the people in power will listen to their annoying and whining voices, nor should they.   Corporations are part of the sphere of the state, and in a way, are part of the state, since their ologiopoly position, their very existence, and all their pricilges, are due t the state giving them. Corporations originally were, and always have been, creations of the state. Samll business meanwhile – the real business, is stifled.   Small businesses are merely small corporations. All of them rely on the state because the state protects property rights, which are an essential component of any market economy. And in exchange for that, they must abide by the law that the state enforces. Businesses agreed to this arrangement because it protects them from crime and gave them legitimacy, and you'll find that most businesses do not oppose the state's influence in the economy. Large corporations, however, have resources to use state power to their advantage, and that is where corruption comes from. But the answer is not to throw out the baby with the bathwater, because with no state businesses often feel unsafe and unprotected from crime, which is why large multinationals tend not to form in developing countries."

You can't even really say that their politics are Marxist, because they don't want to change the system in any way, rather they just want to install women and other ""oppressed"" demographics in positions of power. They're ""Bourgeois Feminists"" if anything."
TiADiscussion,37vzbh,CoMaBlaCK,2,Sun May 31 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"The SJW position on class is largely that it isn't as important as sexism, racism, homophobia and other forms of oppression- you can ""give up"" your class position by giving away all your belongings and using your wealth to help the less privileged, but you cannot give up your status as a person of colour, a woman, or your sexuality.   Class is also a problematic issue for most SJWs as both strands of radical left-wing thought (anarchism/marxism) are inherently based in the idea of class being the primary concern, and the way through which other forms of oppression tend to express themselves. People who are oppressed cannot stop being oppressed until they gain self-determination and the ability to do things themselves- or as the commies put it, to seize the means of production. The SJW ideology speaks only of sites of oppression wrenched from the material basis of social class and treated in the abstract: it has no kind of action plan to create realistic, meaningful alternatives to this oppression, only to endlessly theorise about it. To apply any kind of class analysis is not possible, because to do so would expose them to their own privilege as people who are relatively well off in the richest, most prosperous societies to ever have existed."
TiADiscussion,37vzbh,BrawndoTTM,2,Sun May 31 17:34:12 2015 UTC,In the simplest terms to be on the 'good' side of the sjw movement you've got to be oppressed and a victim and since a majority of the people involved in the sjw movement are well off they focus on topics where they're victims.

Why is this?   I don't personally buy it, but there's a Marxist conspiracy theory floating around that schools are flooded with SJW ideology with the intended purpose of co-opting Marxism into something completely unpalatable to the average person, and to keep the working class divided."
TiADiscussion,37vzbh,BrawndoTTM,3,Sun May 31 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"While I don't fully buy that conspiracy, I do think there are people  with a vetted interest in keeping the Left docile and divided.

And then you may wonder what they could do to help themselves? ""Get back on your feet."" ""Get a job."" Basically, ""Stop being poor."" And it creates a very polarized thought process towards the situation because going from poor to secure is not that simple.  And then some people may say it's their own fault for ending up poor or homeless and their own fault for staying that way for so long.

That being said, the UK is a country that tends to be influenced by America a lot (hell, Black Friday is now a thing across the pond), so it makes sense. Let me guess...it's those going to prestigious schools (Oxford, Cambridge, etc) that are in it the most, right?"
TiADiscussion,37upm3,hfwang18,4,Sat May 30 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's nowhere near as big but it still exists.   Let me guess...it's those going to prestigious schools (Oxford, Cambridge, etc) that are in it the most, right?   Yep."
TiADiscussion,37upm3,Dr0gar,2,Sat May 30 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"A shame. It's, of course, mostly those in Ivy League or Ivy-like schools (Duke, Stanford, Emory, Rice, Northwestern, Washington U. in St. Louis, and even my own Vanderbilt) that are involved in it the most, because the students that attend those schools have to display a large amount of commitment towards helping the less fortunate (volunteering requirements, etc) to get in, and they have to give the appearance that they are not privileged snobs. Ironically, this kind of behavior makes them look even more like privileged snobs, because those who are actually poor, such as myself, don't do it. (Except for minorities...the underrepresented minorities in elite colleges feel extra entitled and virtually all of them are SJWs because they now have a place where everybody bends over backwards to appease them and every time they cry ""microaggression"" people listen.)  You would think that they are smart enough to think critically about the SJW rhetoric that is pervasive among the activists on campus, but they instead use their intelligence to think of ways to justify themselves. Peer pressure to conform also plays a big role (and it's why I have to at least accept feminist ""facts"" before making any argument). It's not even just humanities depts either...I've known female ENGINEERING/SCIENCE students (though not as many) that are SJWs, because of peer pressure from their friend group.  Thankfully, not all elite schools in the US have this problem; but the ones that don't are STEM schools. I wish most of the more general/comprehensive schools are like those as well."

At my university we have a day/week in which there are events with that type of Ideology. Last year it was Intersexuality with the headline ""society creates gender/sex"". (Geselschaft macht geschlecht). I ve got an American Literature professor who suffers from an extrem case of white guilt and is most likely an sjw (she replaced three-quarters of our required reading list with non-white authors). And we even got an Anita Sarkeesian wannabe teaching about sexism in videogames. It is not as prevalent as I didnt have to take anti rape courses but that Ideology does exist alot (especially the humanities which is one reason I might switch over to studying law. I really dont want to attend a seminar which focus lies on ""discovering the homosexual spirit in literature""."

And yes, boys would get in trouble if they wore the same thing!"" That whole crop top resistance shit where every teenage girl practically wore a bra to school in protest just made me roll my eyes. Yeah, some dress code rules are strict, but if you really think you're being oppressed and oversexualized because you can't show your bellybutton at a place meant for learning, then that's just stupid.

I'm a strong believer in the importance of free and open debate, a self-described First Amendment fanatic, and I abhor this latest trend towards silencing people with opposing views via mob action and intimidation.   I also simply have an instinctive, gut-level antipathy to what I call ""enforced piety,"" whether it's from bible-thumping reactionaries talking about God's Law or self-appointed social justice messiahs telling me what a bad person I am for not jumping on their bandwagon.   Edit: I've also been dismayed by the ways in which SJW ideology has infiltrated the field of literary study to the point where it seems sometimes like the only valid critical methodologies are those focused through the lens of race/class/gender. In many cases, it's driven people who actually love literature out of the field, and that makes me sad. I was part of canon revision in the sense that I wanted to see gay authors recognized and studied, but I never signed on to the project of sifting through the whole of the canon looking for racism, sexism, and homophobia."

TiA reminds me that people who agree with my mentality are diverse, that the concept of ""innocence abused"" waving a loaded gun around making demands is neither innocent nor abused, and that my revulsion towards the acceptance of bigotry, intolerance, and authoritarianism in my own political spectrum is well-founded and conscientious on my part."
TiADiscussion,37upm3,Kirioko,9,Sat May 30 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"I'm the typical, poor ""WOC"" (which I still feel like is a Tumblr-friendly way of saying 'black', considering how it's hardly ever applied to other minorities -- and yes, I'm a minority in a white majority country, that's not a bad thing) female from a low income family and even better, from a Muslim family. Oh, and an immigrant. So I guess in another life I'd probably be a ""Muslim feminist"" (which I can't even think about without giggling)... I've also been ostracized and bullied in a public school system, so I would fit right in with the Tumblr crowd. According to their narrative, I suppose I would always expect to be catcalled and harassed on the streets (which, I'm not, probably having to do with me not being one of the ""pretty feminist"" type), experience misogyny (er, no, seeing as I live in a very progressive city in a developed nation), given shit for religion (I was pretty young when 9/11 happened so I can't comment on that, but I've never had anything hateful said to me based on religion alone), or to fight against the ""patriarchy"" (again, see the part where I live in a developed nation and thankfully don't have to fight for my basic rights).  I feel like an anomaly on TiA because of Tumblr. Because of their narrative that TiA must be all white, male, neckbeards. Because as a female I must automatically be against TiA since it's obviously just a bunch of misogynists and rejected males, right? But I think the main thread on TiA is spotting bullshit, in whatever form. Thankfully one of my high school English teachers had us read a great book about spotting bullshit in academia, and it was a read that helped me apply that mentality to other aspects of life. Don't take things at face value, don't always believe everything you read, and most of all, you don't have to tolerate bullshit. It really helped me recognize when some people can be ridiculous and ... even though a lot of them may be young and still developing their ideas about the world (in other words, my age group), I would say that I would like them to be a bit more informed. I'm not trying to act superior to others, but my age group is not known for being the most informed..."

TiADiscussion,37upm3,Mouon,3,Sat May 30 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"The Rape of the Masters: How Political Correctness Sabotages Art by Roger Kimball  It's about the field of art history in academia and how the field has been overrun by political correctness and some weird applications of modern thought on classical art pieces. Here's the summary from Amazon that has a few examples:   Colleges and universities used to teach art history to encourage connoisseurship and acquaint students with the riches of our artistic heritage. But now, as Roger Kimball reveals in this witty and provocative book, the student is less likely to learn about the aesthetics of masterworks than to be told, for instance, that Peter Paul Rubens' great painting Drunken Silenus is an allegory about anal rape. Or that Courbet's famous hunting pictures are psychodramas about ""castration anxiety."" Or that Gauguin's Manao tupapau is an example of the way repression is ""written on the bodies of women."" Or that Jan van Eyck's masterful Arnolfini Portrait is about ""middle-class deceptions ... and the treatment of women."" Or that Mark Rothko's abstract White Band (Number 27) ""parallels the pictorial structure of a pieta."" Or that Winslow Homer's The Gulf Stream is ""a visual encoding of racism."" In ""The Rape of the Masters: How Political Correctness Sabotages Art,"" Kimball, a noted art critic himself, shows how academic art history is increasingly held hostage to radical cultural politics--feminism, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, the whole armory of academic antihumanism. To make his point, he describes how eight famous works of art (reprinted here as illustrations) have been made over to fit a radical ideological fantasy. Kimball then performs a series of intellectual rescue operations, explaining how these great works should be understood through a series of illuminating readings in which art, not politics, guides the discussion. ""The Rape of the Masters"" exposes the charlatanry that fuels much academic art history and leaks into the art world generally, affecting galleries, museums and catalogues. It also provides an engaging antidote to the tendentious, politically motivated assaults on our treasured sources of culture and civilization.   There's a specific part at the end of the book which talks about learning to discern ""rot"" in academic writing... and my teacher just straight up told us that ""this is about learning how to see through bullshit.""  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't like seeing bullshit. And it was a little shocking to see this kind of Tumblr-esque thing even persists in academia.*"

So why do I find TIA discussion appealing? I guess I find SJW ideology, and radical leftism, when it is applied to social issues, to be very damaging to society, and worryingly increasing in its influence. I find TIA discussion to be a place to discuss SJWs and their ilk, while laughing at them as I do so. Furthermore I enjoy how this subreddit is actually pretty centrist, perhaps more center-left, with a diversity of opinions. While many here are centrists, you also get libertarians like me, marxists of the more reasonable kind, some people leading uncomfortably in the SJW direction but still considering themselves anti-SJW, and third wave feminists who are less objectionable than many. There are a small minority here I would actually consider to be effectively SJWs or the bad kind of leftist, even if they do not realize it, but that only makes for more interesting discussion. I enjoy discussing here, trying to persuade people here to my point of view, and also to some extent (though I know I shouldn't) outright arguing with people here. That said though sometimes I find someone here say something so objectionable to me its hard to resist trying to refute their arguments... So generally speaking, its actually a pretty fun and interesting subreddit for discussion about SJWs.   Oh yeah and I forgot to say, I'm white, male, middle class, prefer the opposite sex, but also epileptic and have a muscular condition. But still by SJW standards, given my 'privilege' and distinctly 'unprogressive' views, I would be considered scum of the earth..."

We don't demonize all heterosexual people, and judging by the changes in public opinion, we appear to have made some very effective arguments for dignity and equal treatment under the law. We've worked through the legal and haven't started riots. We generally don't issue violent calls for vengeance, etc... I'm sure to some SJW types, that seems ""assimilationist"" and bourgeois, but it's brought about practical progress."

I think the AIDS crisis was the only time when civil disobedience was even close to being prevalent (ACT-UP), and that was involved targeted actions in response to people dying en masse.   One way that the conservative push to ban gay marriage unwittingly helped our cause is that it centered the movement in the courts instead of in academia, where much of the feminist movement thrives. A gay rights movement focused on concepts of heteronormativity and queer theory never would have convinced outsiders the way that arguments based on fundamental rights did. When you have to convince appellate judges appointed by Reagan and GHW Bush, and the gay rights movement did succeed with a surprising number of them, the insular ideas of academics are never going to work."

TiADiscussion,37upm3,snow-siren,5,Sat May 30 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"As of right now, the Department of Education essentially coerces colleges to do their own internal investigations of campus sexual assault, despite recommendations against this practice from constitutional lawyers and professors at the top law schools, civil rights groups (such as Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), and even RAINN (Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network). Colleges are basically forced to do it anyway otherwise they can lose federal funding for student financial aid if they have a Title IX violation found against them (which in this current campus climate, isn't too difficult unfortunately).  Lots of ineffective sexual violence prevention focuses on awareness campaigns (Take Back the Night, Walk A Mile in Her Shoes, etc.) or ""teaching men not to rape"" (basically consent education). These are largely ineffective and do more to alienate people than anything else. Most effective practices include teaching people self-protective behaviors (this oftentimes get's mislabeled as victim-blaming, although even RAINN agrees it's irresponsible not to do so) and bystander intervention training (teaching people signs somebody might be at risk of sexual assault or might be in an abusive relationship, and ways they can go about intervening or helping the person). Unfortunately higher education is kind of slow at moving in this direction, in large part because of the federal government tbh."
TiADiscussion,37upm3,shitlordeyayaya,3,Sat May 30 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"My college has this problem, unfortunately, as a result of a rape incident that happened a couple of years ago in which the perpetrators were eventually convicted and sentenced. There has been lots of talk about preventing sexual violence since, and most of it unproductive. We also have to abide by the laws on internal investigations.  The whole ""teach men not to rape"" thing sounds a bit self-defeating- anyone who respects the law will know what not to do. And the argument that self-defense education = victim blaming is just flat-out ridiculous...victim blaming is saying that the victim deserved it or was ""asking for it"", while self-defense is all about ways to protect yourself. I know that people say ""why didn't you fight back harder"" as victim-blaming comments, but that's not an argument for ending self-protection classes. Bystander intervention has been talked about at my school though, so it is a step in the right direction."

I also detest censorship of any kind strongly and this includes shaming creators in an attempt to force them to self-censor. Every single dictatorship in the history of mankind, every big oppressor started by attacking free speech, either openly or covertly. I am still struggling how SJWs can't see that attacking free speech and freedom of expression is the fastest route towards an oppressive society.   Finally I hate the self-righteous attitude SJWs tend to have. I remember one time I engaged in a discussion with somebody else about Islam and it was a nice discussion until some SJW overheard something my opponent said and tried to lecture him. The SJW obviously didn't notice that I am a Muslim (my people are Slavs so even though a majority of us is Muslim we don't look like it.) so him deciding to get offended on behalf of all Muslim when there is a Muslim standing next to him not taking offense whatsoever... the look on his face was brilliant when I told him about my background. But in general I don't feel that as a Muslim I need ""allies"" that will speak for me. I live in a free society, I can talk for myself. I don't need no SJW trying to overcome his white guilt."

The comment section (especially when other queer people comment!) makes me feel better that there are a lot of people out there paying attention to how shitty these people are, even if their politics aren't the same as mine at least they're highlighting SJW douchebaggery and fighting back against the infiltration of their stupidity in online spaces.   I will say though, the quality has gone downhill hugely over the past six to nine months- I think it's because so many MRAs got involved in ""Gamergate"" and then bled over to TiA. There are a lot more pointless posts trying to drum up people against non-SJW people (like moderate feminists, or really young people) and that bothers me a bit, like, everyone is stupid in some way when they are young, and publicly shaming them is just going to make them double-down and become twice as stupid."

I wish that promoting that kind of attitude is more prevalent those who advocate for marginalized people, because it is ultimately in their hands the power to uplift themselves."

TiADiscussion,37upm3,hfwang18,5,Sun May 31 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"White female, Canadian, liberal, mid-20s. Just finished university in Toronto as all this stuff was starting to gain real traction beyond Tumblr. Here for a few reasons:  I've always, always been allergic to extremism and mass panics no matter what it's about. I remember as a kid being angry at SARS hysteria, flu shot hysteria, moral panic over South Park etc, abortion protestors showing graphic imagery at unrelated public events, generally people freaking out too much puts me off. Outrage culture drives me completely up the wall. It doesn't change anyone's mind about an issue or better society. It accomplishes nothing other than hurting and angering people.   I've been left-wing from the time I was able to understand politics. Economically I am still very left-wing and think democratic socialist systems are ideal. As for how I live my life, I personally am rather square (not interested in casual sex, don't drink or do drugs, Catholic family, really believe in being kind and humble over anything else) but I couldn't care less about what other people choose to do in their own personal lives as long as they aren't hurting anyone. It used to be right-wingers that wanted to make everyone abide by their moral rules and I abhor that. Now it's left-wingers. It terrifies me how little I relate to a lot of liberals these days, and it is nice to see (at least in TiAD) that most people here are the same as me.  I've been mentally ill my entire life and seeing teens glamourize mental illness and social isolation and generally not being mentally healthy as attractive or cool has always completely infuriated me even in the days of emo and goth kids. But they just kind of kept to themselves and at least admitted that it is miserable to be depressed. Tumblrina types make it look desirable and like there's something wrong with recovery or trying to be mentally well. And of course self-diagnosis doesn't hep either.   Of all of the SJW issues however the one I have the biggest problem with by far is third wave feminism. I was relentlessly bullied by girls and emotionally abused by women throughout my childhood and early adolescence. It was the boys and men in my life who were my real supports. It has taken me a long time to even learn to trust other women again. At the same time I am not really a traditionally feminine woman. I have always done my own thing and not really factored ""I am a woman"" into a large part of my overall concept of self. I've been proud to have accomplished most of what I want, and I have never fallen back on ""help me I'm a poor helpless woman"". (I also know I have been able to accomplish what I want partially because of my other privileges, particularly coming from an upper-middle class family. I believe in privilege, but I don't think men have much privilege over women, especially when you're a well-off white kid like me. This idea that feminists promote that a wealthy, heterosexual white woman at a prestigious college is less privileged than a poor black gay man living in an inner city is so fucking ridiculous and makes me so angry.) So feminists floating this idea that all women are wonderful angels who can do no wrong, men are always the abusers, women are always victims, women are always at a disadvantage, women can't possibly resist media stereotypes, all the typical shit you see here... it drives me completely crazy. I don't want the young girls in my life growing up believing this. It is so disempowering. I want them to feel they can do whatever they want, that they are not victims of life, and to judge people on how they individually treat others, not their sex.  I had a Tumblr from 2009 until last year. I really liked the site a lot back in those days. It was a fun way to connect with people with similar interests. Now you can't go on there without seeing this stuff. And it's spreading to the rest of the internet. As said bullied, depressed kid I turned to the community of weirdos on the internet for company, and I miss old internet culture so much. Now everything is just angry and desperate for attention.  So anyway. I'm pretty much here to show myself that I'm not the only one that feels this way, because a lot of the time online I do feel like that."
TiADiscussion,37upm3,hfwang18,3,Sun May 31 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed about TiAD is...it's mostly liberal yet sane! I rarely see that; though I'm generally considered by Americans to be moderately liberal, I get trashed by both conservatives and by the SJW left, and I know very few moderates besides my friends. I know that some of my moderately liberal friends in other colleges often feel the pressure to go full SJW, and I feel really bad for them; they're being threatened with ostracism and reputation as a conservative Republican (which I and my liberal friends consider to be egregious insults) if they don't comply. I know I've been called a Republican or a conservative by SJWs myself for merely not agreeing with them, just to insult me.  I wonder what the role of being bullied has in creating SJWs. I think the reason why you turned out alright was because you were mostly bullied by other women and so befriended mostly men, which makes your experiences not mesh with the SJW narrative, but those who might have been exposed to some form of bullying or bigotry might be likely to become SJWs if they get exposed to the Tumblr crowd as preteens/early teens because they are desperate to have their experiences validated. Their glorification of suffering might come from that as well...they make it part of their identity, while someone like yourself tries to cope and get through it, which is, as someone who have had my own problems with suicidal thoughts, low confidence, being bullied, and constantly being in a state of high anxiety and stress, what you should do.  What university did you attend? (You don't have to answer if it makes you feel uncomfortable.) I've actually heard about Toronto's SJW-ism from another Canadian Redditor, and he said that it mostly comes from U of T. If so, this would be a similar trend as south of the border; it is the more prestigious colleges that have the most SJWs, because the wealthy whites want to look like they aren't privileged, wealthy snobs (the ones on scholarship typically are normal students), and the minorities (poor and rich) because they get a sense of entitlement from being catered to by everyone and having their every little whim validated.  Also, as you are Canadian with knowledge of Canadian politics, could you explain to me the difference between the Liberals and the NDP? The NDP is relatively new as Canada's 2nd party, it's getting a lot of votes mostly at the expense of the Liberals, and I want to know what's going on between them. Which of the two do you prefer? I wish Canada the best of luck in throwing out the bum Harper in October (I heard he's really unpopular over there, sorta like Bush with us here down south)."
TiADiscussion,37upm3,hfwang18,2,Mon Jun 1 05:49:59 2015 UTC,"I often wonder if, had I been ten years younger, I would have become an SJW. I was very, very anti-conservative as a teenager (then again this was the Bush era and it was focused on different things that I still very much agree with, ie. being anti-war, separation of church and state, against cuts to welfare and education, etc) I think the only thing that would have kept me back is the feminism piece that I just cannot get onboard with. I actually did call myself a feminist for a while, when I started university, but by the end of my time in school it had become too extreme for my tastes.  My experience is that U of T is worst for this stuff. I think you hit the nail on the head with rich white kids wanting to look like they're not privileged. York is more focused on labour issues and goes out on strike pretty much bi-yearly but has always been ultra-liberal. Ryerson attracts a lot of working class kids and lots of ethnic diversity (it's more of an applied school) and while the student union is very SJW-y, the student body really isn't.  So the thing you have to understand about Canadian politics first is that the American idea of what is ""liberal"" at least within the Republican-Democrat setup is very different here. Here, any politician arguing against universal healthcare would be completely torn apart (and rightfully in my opinion). Gay marriage is a total non-issue, it's been legal since 2004 with little protest. Our cultural context is also very different. We don't have the issues with racism against blacks in the widespread way the U.S. does. That would be more comparable to how Native people are treated here. The metaphor that the US is a cultural melting pot whereas Canada is a mosaic is true - people are encouraged to hang on to their originating cultures. Then there's Quebec which would take a whole other essay to explain. So we deal with a different set of issues. It's also why when I hear Canadian SJWs talk like we do have the exact same problems as the US, because they get all their news from American social media it drives me nuts.   Our Conservative party has become more right wing in the last 10 years under Stephen Harper. The federal conservatives were the ""Progressive Conservatives"" for a long time and Harper came from a couple of failed right-wing parties, Reform and the Canadian Alliance. Eventually in the early 00s after having been out of office since the 80s the collective right-wing parties realized they needed to unite if they ever wanted power again, so they did under the Conservative party. Harper is the most right-wing PM we've had in decades. Most Canadians don't like him, but the problem now is what you said, that the Liberals and NDP (and other smaller parties - we have the Greens that only have one seat but still take votes away from the other leftie parties, and the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec which is a Quebec nationalist party, plus a whole bunch of random parties and independents) split the vote.  The Liberal party goes back to the 1800s. I would call them centre-left. They were Canada's most successful party through the 20th century. However they were hurt by financial scandals during the last Liberal government in the mid-00s, then in every election since they've run bad campaigns and weak leaders. I think part of the Liberals' problem is that they are too middle of the road in a time when everyone loves being so black and white extreme with their politics, which is a shame. Now their leader is Justin Trudeau who is the son of Pierre Trudeau, probably Canada's best-known prime minister ever. His government put through a lot of the stuff that Canadians base our national identity on. People either love him or hate him. This is basically like if JFK Jr. has lived and was the Democratic presidential candidate.  The NDP is actually not that new of a party, the party itself started in the 60s but their predecessors came around in the 30s. They are a democratic socialist party and more left-wing than the Liberals. They put some focus on race, gender and sexuality issues (ie. they're the ones taking most of the claim for the fact that Canada just got rid of taxes on menstrual products), but those really aren't their main issues. They're much more focused on poverty, public services and traditional social democracy issues. They came second in our last election. However their leader at the time, Jack Layton, who was very charismatic and well-liked, died of cancer a few months after the election. I would say if he was still alive they would have a very good chance at winning this year's election. But right now I'm really afraid the Liberals and NDP are just going to split the vote again and we'll continue to be stuck with Harper until they can learn to get along. Problem is the two parties love taking swipes at each other and both have said they're not interested in merging.  Anyway... tl;dr, Liberals are centre-left, NDP is more left, both basically want the same things but can't get along."

I know plenty of SJWs your age and a few years younger, and they are based on Facebook rather than Tumblr, and are far more sophisticated in their arguments. But then again, I go to what Americans would consider a prestigious university, and so it is more common among people I know than what would be typical. Plenty of feminists too...not really, really extreme, but they repeat a lot of myths, like the wage gap myth (is there one in Canada?), and the 1/4 or 1/5 rape statistic. I was a libertarian (American term meaning very free-market/laissez-faire economics but liberal social views) when I was in my early teenage years, but went to being where I am today at around age 17. I didn't particularly have economic views before age 13-14, but had somewhat liberal social views, stemming from lack of religious upbringing and being bullied as a child.

I've noticed that working class people, with the exception of minorities on scholarship in prestigious colleges (because they are catered to on their every whim and want to ""represent"" their ethnicity by making a big deal out of it and being an SJW for their causes), don't really do that SJW stuff- they got more important issues to deal with, and they feel none of the privilege guilt, even if SJWs try, miserably, to convert them by saying ""you're privileged too!"" (and talk about ""white, thin, able-bodied"" privilege that typical working class whites have), which does nothing but piss them off.   I think part of the Liberals' problem is that they are too middle of the road in a time when everyone loves being so black and white extreme with their politics, which is a shame.

But extremists tend to think in absolutes, and they think that ceding any ground will mean capitulating entirely- and their opposite counterpart, their mortal enemy, the kind of person they think of when they think of a ""liberal"", is the SJW. A large reason why they oppose even moderate things is because of the slippery slope theory- they think that if you let those things happen, soon enough the entire boatload of SJW policies will become accepted in the future, because they think that the moderates are just SJWs who want their agenda imposed slowly."

Or even have these crazy views. I don't know what is going on with your sociology professor. Professors might offer a view like that--and it is a question that you can consider whether violence in response to injustice is justified if nothing else works. Or maybe your sociology professor is an idiot. Gender Studies gets a bad rap but most gender studies professors are studying real things like the effects of the Rwandan genocide on raped women and the children that survived the genocide. It's nothing like what the SJWs are putting  on their blogs.   But I do get your point...I really do. The small group. Shit. Yeah! Your point is good. I actually agree with you, to be honest. It's weird how people can take the most real thing in the world--which is injustice--and then just turn into their own stupid talking point. They are screwing things up.  Tl; dr: You are right."

I imagine by far rightwingers you are in part talking about libertarians, and I don't think its fair to dismiss us as just all batshit crazy without considering what we have to say. Of course you may well also refer to fascists and actual nasty peope, as 'far right nutcases', and in those cases you would be right (although its still worth considering that even many of them are mislead disillusioned people who mean well but have been led astray, not to defend them or anything). I'm not an MRA, though I am opposed to second and third wave feminism, and I'm not MGTOW either, but I think its only a noisy minority of MRAs who are actually crazy hateful ideologues.

As a university student, and especially as a former RA, I hear SJ stuff on pretty much a daily basis. I grew up in a right-leaning town where I originally held some homophobic feelings. Upon entering high school I started to have a massive change of heart, and discovering in my junior year that my best friend since 2nd grade was gay, I fully embraced the idea of everyone having equal rights. When I moved off to university, I started to hear slightly more extreme versions of these ideas, but nothing too bad. I'm pretty reclusive and I don't really care about what the Student Union does, so I never really experienced any rabid SJWs. Then in my second year I became an RA, and on the first day of training the people in charge of the dorms gave us the ""racism = power + privilege"" BS; they never went full #killallwhitemen, but I can see them sinking to that low in a few years. That was my first real exposure to how backwards SJWs can think. Me and another guy on my staff would constantly make fun of the constant social justice stuff our bosses would make us read, and in response I started to find stuff that proved that what they were telling us had serious flaws. It was through this browsing that I discovered TiA.  I have lived in an environment where these people had power over me- they could have easily taken away my job, and by extension my home, on a moment's notice, if they determined that I was no longer stepping in line with their ideology.  In particular, though, I have a special vendetta against the mental health side of tumblr. I have Asperger's, and while I today I can function perfectly fine, I will always feel that there is something off. When I was younger it was particularly bad. When I received the diagnosis, my parents immediately had me go through a treatment program with child psychologists, and did everything they could to make sure that I could live a normal life. I owe my ability to function as a member of society to the efforts my parents and those doctors. So to hear tumblrinas insist that autism and other disabilities are ""cute"", that they should be encouraged, and that treatment takes away their uniqueness, I take it as a personal insult. They are calling all of the people who have helped me get to where I am today worthless, and they're telling me that I'm shunning my ""uniqueness"" by wanting to live a normal life. Fuck them."

If a woman feels scared of being raped, the SJWs would rebuke all men for creating an unsafe atmosphere for her and say that any helpful advice on decreasing the likelihood of rape while there are still rapists out there is ""victim blaming"" (they seem to think that rapists actually listen to people telling them not to rape).

So back in High School, many classroom and faculty doors would have a little sticker with a rainbow triangle on it that said ""safe space"".  That meant two things.  First, bigotry of any kind (especially homophobia) would not be tolerated there.  Second, and most important, was that the teacher in that classroom was someone who students could talk to about something that they might not be comfortable telling their parents (for example, as the sticker implied, coming out as LGBT)  Now fast forward to college, where in a wing of my dorm there was one room with a coded lock on it, which I assumed was for storage.  Then one day I saw a group of students going in there, and one of my neighbors was punching in the code, and they told me that it was a Safe Space for LGBT club meetings.  I thought that was a little overkill, and considering the demographics and political leanings of my school I questioned the need for such a secure location.

TiADiscussion,37qycx,The_Donaven,3,Fri May 29 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"WHY do they feel they can't relate to it?   They might define themselves by their race a lot, their ethnicity's culture could play a massive role in their identity or they could live in an area where they're defined by their race by others.   For someone whose primary identity characteristic is being black it would be hard to relate to a character the same way you might find it hard relating to a character that doesn't reflect your values or cultural customs, which is why lots of characters are always criticized as ""white washed"".  It would also be hard to relate to a character that doesn't reflect your life experience if you grew up in squalor or a ghetto, and the character grew up in middle class suburbia, which might also play a role in how these people feel under-represented.   However this issue will never really change until the population demographics change, because if you have to cater to one racial demographic the big box-office behemoths are gonna cater to the majority racial demographic of the US, and that's currently white people."

That's a fact, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing because semographics (both in terms of gross numbers and in terms of purchasing power) America is majority white. You appeal to the lowest common denominator. So when America does remakes of foreign folms, of course they white wash it, they're making the movie for white people. Oldboy was a Korean film that was terribly remade recently with white characters in America. Is it white washed, yes. But when Korea reboots American movies, they're Korean washed. The Good, the Bad, and the Weird come to mind.  While you can enjoy media with different people, it's easier to relate to people that are similar to you, because their experiences will more mirror yours. I enjoy both the Wire and Sons of Anarchy. While The Wire is a better series and I enjoy it more, I relate more to Sons of Anarchy, because I can't relate to drug dealers from Baltimore projects, but I can to middle class white people from the suburbs who also happen to bike."

TiADiscussion,37rl90,snow-siren,3,Sun May 31 02:35:10 2015 UTC,"short version: It's kind of like GamerGate for sci-fi/fantasy books.   long version: There's an award that big in sci-fi and fantasy lit (that a lot of people have never heard of outside of that community) called the Hugo. Nominees and winners are voted on by pretty much anyone who buys a membership pass for an event called World Con. A Republican sci-fi author who owns a gun store (I think) got a nomination a while back and found that everyone was spreading rumors about him being a horrible person and imploring voters not to read his book. Standard SJW style, this guy is racist and sexist and you shouldn't support him type stuff. He determined that they objected to his political allegiance, and that SJWs had too strong a presence in the Hugos, so a few years back he ran a campaign called Sad Puppies where he urged his fans to vote for him just to prove that the SJWs would be pissed off if he got a nomination. It didn't really get much ground.  Year two he enlisted a few other people and the focus was instead getting others who the SJWs wouldn't want in onto the ballot. They had moderate success, and succeeded in proving that SJWs would be pissed off by this because of political leanings rather than writing merit (which, ideally, is what a lit award would be based on.)  The current Sad Puppies is wave three. Between them and a separate group with a similar goal going by the name Rabid Puppies, they pretty much claimed every single nomination for writers they wanted. SJW readers and GRRM have been up in arms over it, and there was a push to try and get everyone to vote ""No Award"" in every single category to keep the awards from going to a bunch of racist white men. (Note: the nominees this year are more diverse than last.) It's exposed SJWs to a portion of the lit community, and kind of completely discredited the Hugos, since it also proved that the voting system is pretty easy to game. Although in Sad Puppies' defense, they haven't so much said ""vote for these people"" as ""these are people we'd like to see win, and you should read their stuff and vote for them if you like it,"" and I believe it's been proven that pretty much no one voted for the exact list that Sad Puppies put out."

He and the guy who started Sad Puppies had a bit of a public back and forth addressing blog posts to one another when it turned out that wave three was a success, with him shaming them and saying they were basically ruining the Hugos and undermining it's worth, and waffling on whether it was an award for the best as chosen by the people, or those who ""true fans"" felt were deserving.   SP and GG are the only two current push backs that I know of. Other than that it's just people giving props here and there to companies and content producers who don't bow down to SJW complaints.

Diagnoses are complicated. It's not cut and dried. We need clinicians' help interpreting our symptoms for a reason. What you might think is depression, for instance, could be a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency.  I do have a lot of sympathy for people who have trouble finding a capable doctor. Public/low-income mental illness clinics are often utter shit. In those cases, I think it can be wise to proceed as if you have the disease you suspect you do.

TiADiscussion,37q9lg,Necronometer,2,Fri May 29 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"It's okay to look at yourself and realize you might have a mental illness. Looking up symptoms is perfectly fine and bringing up your concerns with a doctor is absolutely a good thing.  I don't think it's ever okay to self diagnose yourself. You are not a professional and mental illness cannot be put into a box like that. Just because you fit all the criteria for depression does not mean you have it, and you shouldn't say you do unless you get diagnosed with it.  As I said, it's fine to look up conditions that you might have, as long as you go see a doctor. If you have no intentions of seeing a doctor and are just using it as a way to seem cool or have an excuse for things, it's not okay."
TiADiscussion,37q9lg,fuckingliterally,2,Sun May 31 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"Her reasoning is it's expensive and I thought I know it's true don't even think of trying to get diagnose unless you think you have it its not cheap and they might be wrong. If possible get multiple diagnose the average person can't diagnose illnesses. Don't bother if your self diagnose just to say you have a trendy illness,excuse to be a asshole, or believe along lines of aspie is socially awkward."
TiADiscussion,37q9lg,Spysnakez,2,Sun May 31 03:29:21 2015 UTC,"It can definitely get expensive if you have no insurance, and I completely understand that. But if someone thinks they might have a mental illness, I definitely think it's worth the money to get some help, even if it's just a therapist. I hate it when people diagnose themselves just to be trendy or have an excuse for being a dick. There's no excuse for that, period."
TiADiscussion,37q9lg,HenryCGk,2,Sun May 31 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"I think when it comes to mental illness, it's certainly healthy to recognize when your behaviors are impacting your life in a negative way and causing distress/harm to yourself or others. I also think it's fine to look up possible conditions related to your symptoms, but only if you fully understand that a) no website is meant to be used as a replacement for medical care, b) you really do need to go to an actual doctor for an accurate diagnosis, and c) you should not trust yourself after looking up various conditions because you may subconsciously insert symptoms that aren't there.   There are many illnesses that have similar symptoms. Some are more serious than others and they can be completely indistinguishable to someone who isn't a trained professional. I know that not all doctors are perfect and you may need to get a second, third, or fourth opinion. I know that sometimes it can be a huge hassle or basically impossible to get a diagnosis because of lack of insurance. I'm currently on state-provided health insurance and I don't even think my clinic has the services that I need. I know a lot of people are in the same boat. But even if lack of proper healthcare is a reality in your life, you are still in no position to diagnose yourself.  I think that people self-dx on Tumblr partially because of armchair-psychiatrist posts that write about actual conditions with the depth of a horoscope or a fortune cookie. Some of the ""information"" posts that circulate talk about symptoms of mild social anxiety (which is not an uncommon thing to have by any stretch of the imagination) and package them up as basically every other mental illness. It's a self-insert story in which your behaviors suddenly appear to be maladaptive and you suddenly have an illness that absolves you from taking responsibility for things like being an asshole. It's absolutely inappropriate and it's pretty disgusting that these people just want the labels and have no intention of ever going to a doctor because it may contradict their mental-illness-based persona.  I firmly believe that self-dxing without any intention of ever going to a medical professional is never okay. It's fine to speculate and listen to your body, but the only thing that can truly help you is to have a good conversation with a doctor about your health so that you can work together to discover the best plan for your wellbeing."

Conversations are hard to follow, the simplest things tend to distract me (such as what I'm doing this very second), and you should consider yourself lucky if I get your name right after hearing it for the 5th time. I've wondered if I have adhd, but I've heard of so many stories about people becoming addicted to the meds and how it can affect anxious people that I'm not particularly interested in seeking a diagnosis. Instead I've read up on various ways to keep yourself focused and productive and such, all of which is probably good advice that anyone should know about if you're serious about your education and improving yourself. In this context I don't see self diagnosis to be a bad thing. Mind you, I don't really apply the label to myself, rather I just look at the types of behaviour that I do that is counter productive and try to do my best on controlling it.  Ok fuckingliterally, back to the books."
TiADiscussion,37q9lg,CptxMorgan,1 point,Sun May 31 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"I think they are almost mocking mentally ill people.  Really, I get it, some people can't go to a doctor (US, get your shit together with universal healthcare already) and they have to rely on themselves. But. You can't diagnose anything on your own.  You can't prescribe medication for yourself. You can just feel that you have certain symptoms, list them, and then head to the pdoc.  I have suffered from depression throughout my whole life. It has always been very treatment resistant. So what I did, was that I researched my current symptoms and my family history. There seemed to be something more. My mother mentioned that my father, now passed away, used to have severe manic episodes, he just never went to a doctor about it.  I thought that I could have bipolar. So I went to a psychiatrist and told him my suspicions. He agreed. Now bipolar 2 is my, I don't know what it is called, preliminary diagnosis? Meaning that it is strongly suspected, but there hasn't been enough monitoring to confirm the suspicions. I respond to the current medication quite well.  See, this is the difference between Tumblr self-diagnosis and healthy suspicions. Tumblrettes have a bad day, they go to internet, internet tells them they must have at least a Major Depressive Disorder.  So they self-diagnose that and all is well. Because they don't actually have anything, they don't need treatment.  Genuinely mentally ill people have a bad day. They see that they have probably had a bad day every day in the last few years. So they go to a psychiatrist. Pdoc makes a diagnosis and gives the patient meds and/or therapy sessions. All is not well, but often it will get a little better. Without treatment, things could go very badly. Now the patient at least has a chance.  Then there is the group which suffers from this self-diagnosis trend. They are the people who have something wrong with them and they really should get help. But the fuckers in Tumblr lie to them that all is well if they only accept themselves. Those people have suffered, do suffer and will suffer in the future. Think for example the people claiming they have ""headmates"". I could bet my left testicle that a few of them are untreated schizophrenics.  And that is why I hate the whole thing. It is NOT okay to self-diagnose."

In fact, I would even go ahead and say that a diagnosis implies the participation of a medical doctor, so to call it a ""self-diagnosis"" is a misnomer.  It's perfectly fine to recognize problematic symptoms.  The next step is to see a professional to figure out what it actually is.    Diagnoses may surprise you.  Mine often did.  This isn't something that you want and is likely not even something you'd expect.  The experience of an illness is completely different from how it appears in someone else or from what you can determine from reading online.  This is why we see an impartial third party to help us determine these things."

TiADiscussion,37oxmj,ImTheBurgerKing,12,Fri May 29 07:54:02 2015 UTC,It used to be that feminism was a fight for rights and opportunities women didn't have. So the push was for women to consider themselves strong enough to have those rights and opportunities.  Modern western feminism exists in a society where women have the same rights and opportunities so it must invent new ways to justify its existence. This involves inventing oppression which of course means making women look like weak victims as a side effect they try to sweep under the carpet.

Notice that the idea of female protection is very poorly considered. Usually third wave feminists turn for protection to the state, but the state as a protector is physically represented by police and army. Which is dominantly male. Also mainly consist of burly, tough, manly males, essentially what are the TWFs most scared of.  One should also consider that probles of society as presented b SJWs are unsolvable. They are simply not rational, therefore no rational solution will resolve them.  Hence it is also problematic to find clear way of thinking of a SJW as well as to find any sense or consistency in what they say.  Socratic dialogue as anathema to them, which probably is why they avoid any kind of public debate."
TiADiscussion,37oxmj,shouldnbeonreddit,3,Fri May 29 10:43:53 2015 UTC,"The way I like to point this out is by pointing out how often they're also Marxists, and beating a Marxist in debate is laughably easy.  ""Why is capitalism bad?""  ""It creates a system of inequality which leads to dehumanization and death.""  ""Both the USSR's and China's attempts to enact communism led to unheard of amounts of dehumanization, inequality, death, and suffering. How will you enact a Marxist revolution that will not result in the same thing?""  ""By crushing the patriarchy.""  Then we go down that rabbit hole.  It's simply blatantly obvious that they haven't thought past the problem. They found the problem and latched onto the first possible solution that came by without any critical thinking about whether or not it was a feasible solution. Intersectionality was simply their way of making one big ol Ouroboros-like daisy chain of problems."

The idea that women are weaker and in need of protection fits in with traditional gender roles better, so it's probably a little easier to recruit for, even among people for whom the gender role beliefs are subconscious. Repurposing someone's ingrained belief system for one's own ends is easier than changing belief systems."
TiADiscussion,37oxmj,garybuseysawakening,4,Fri May 29 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"The idea is that women are innately as strong as men, but society has beaten them down so hard and so long that they are fragile shells of their potential, and thus society must atone for its misgivings by 'leveling the playing field' and ensuring parity in representation. Anything but this is merely proof of the patriarchy.  Feminists claim to not believe in tabula rasa--primarily due to Pinker utterly fucking destroying this notion for the public at large--but make no mistake: they believe in it to the level that they can get away with. Feminists do not believe there to be any differences in innate predilections or abilities between men or women, and any that show up are merely the result of the patriarchy's influence; this creates a class of oppressive men and the proleteriat, submissive women."

It is what is known as 'prescriptive linguistics'. They know the power of the word 'racism', but unlike most people who believe racism/anti-racism to be an ideal, they believe it to be a microcosm of greater societal inequality, hence 'microaggressions'.   Fun fact: as a white man, calling someone a dirty sandnigger and punching him in the face repeatedly is a 'microaggression'.

Grandstanding is required in such cases (for example, in Plessy, a private detective was hired by the anti-racist group specifically too arrest Plessy for a racial reason rather than any other, to force the challenge).   The really interesting question is, if we'd had a Youtube video of Rosa Parks getting arrested, do you think she would have become such a symbol?    I think she would have become a symbol for a while, and for a few, and maybe if she'd gone viral.   Instead of a story of bravery which had its vague corners filled in with our own imaginations   The problem here isn't so much that (which is half the problem), but an accelerated news cycle that inundates is in so many of these stories that we have a sensory overload.  Rosa Parks would have gotten less coverage than Ferguson, because she wasn't killed, unfortunate as that is to say.  When the media shaped the story, and disseminated national news, it picked up a story like that, focused on it, and if any other stories came out, they were either ignored (because there was an existing narrative to build on) or integrated into the main narrative.  In short, there was a singular, pointed narrative. Now there's a huge amount of conflicting narratives.

Social Justice is about helping the oppressed and stopping the oppressors. The issue you see is that it's been nearly completely overtaken by people who think that All White People are evil racist oppressors and that all PoC are the oppressed. Or all Trans People. Or all women.   You just can't apply generalizations like that and assume that any real justice is going to be done. Some of the worst oppressors in history are PoC. Some of the most marginalized and oppressed people in the world are white. Some of the worst societies have been one where women were in charge.

Social justice is a process in which we strive to eliminate the roots of oppression  through education and the redistribution of resources, opportunities, and responsibilities.

TiADiscussion,37ncoj,LWMR,6,Fri May 29 00:04:18 2015 UTC,"There's a long story behind that, and I think you may be looking for something that doesn't exist. ""The"" movement isn't necessarily a thing, because of the long journey the phrase has taken.  The term social justice in regular use probably started with the Jesuits. There's a wall of text about it here, from which I excerpt:   While I have identified 1975 as a watershed date for the Jesuits, social justice work was nothing new, neither for Jesuits nor for other Christian groups. Indeed what is today called social justice work in Catholic circles has its roots in the practices of social Catholicism that emerged in Europe in the mid to late nineteenth century in response to the new forms of poverty generated by industrial capitalism. What changed in 1975 however, and what quickly became deeply controversial, was the newly comprehensive and corporate nature of the commitment. Social justice  - or the social apostolate as it is called  - was no longer one ministry among many, but was to be instead a constitutive dimension of all Jesuit ministries, from university administration to parish preaching, and of the very Jesuit vocation itself, understood as a whole.   ""social Catholicism"" in that passage derives in turn from the social gospel, an invention of utopian ""let's build Heaven on Earth"" people like Walter Rauschenbusch, author of Theology for the Social Gospel, in which he expressed a view that would be considered apostasy by many Christians elsewhere:   ""Jesus did not in any real sense bear the sin of some ancient Briton who beat up his wife in B. C. 56, or of some mountaineer in Tennessee who got drunk in A. D. 1917. But he did in a very real sense bear the weight of the public sins of organized society, and they in turn are causally connected with all private sins.""   That's the ""social"" part. Now for the ""justice"" part.  Justice used to mean approximately the accurate and reliable execution of the law. If the law said that a thief shall receive five strokes of the whip, then giving five strokes of the whip to the thief was just, but four strokes were unjust, six strokes were unjust, throwing the thief in prison was unjust, hanging the thief was unjust, and letting the thief go (whether because the judge was too soft-hearted to punish the thief at trial, or the police were too lazy to catch the thief in the first place) was unjust. Justice was closely related to the rule of law, and very useful in creating a stable society where a man could engage in long-term planning because he knew what the law was.  This term has since been reinterpreted a hell of a lot. I don't have an exact date for when the shift started, but in 1971 there was a major marker of the shift when the philosophist John Rawls put out his book A Theory of Justice, in which he uses the word ""justice"" to mean something much closer to ""social justice"". In the opening chapter, Justice as Fairness, he writes:   Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others. It does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many.   Which is a massive change from the previous meaning of ""justice"". Here it means something more like egalitarian treatment. Also, taken at face value, this would imply that one can't put criminals in prison. Rawls will of course walk back this implication a short while later when he says that these propositions have been expressed too strongly, but then he'll keep taking these propositions at face value anyway and reason from them to draw equally absurd implications about how everything in society should be redistributed until it's fair, and if it ever gets unfair, the passive voice must intervene and redistribute some more, because justice.  So. When you put together ""social"" as in social activism, ""justice"" as in levelling, a movement founded on fanatical devotion to the Pope, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, what do you get? A whole load of really weird nonsense that I don't think has a coherent movement you can point to and say ""that's the real social justice movement""."

Whereas fanatical devotion to the Pope was more properly found among the Jesuits, whose founder Ignatius is infamous for remarking that if he saw white and the Pope said it was black, he'd say it was black."

This comic does not do that, it shows three different people and explicitly acknowledges that they are different.

You either need to buy a ticket (which costs a lot of money) or watch it on TV on Sports Center (which still costs money).   Or we can look at it another way: watching the game is not watching the game is not watching the game. Let's suppose tall guy owns all 3 boxes. He can see iver the fence without them, but the best option available to him is to stack all three boxes on top of each other and sit, giving him both a better view and a more relaxed position to watch the game. So to get all 3 people to see the game, you're still denying one of them the best option, which is still a cost.

I'm not saying he can't share the boxes, I'm just saying whether or not he does is his decision.

[...] While the concept of social justice can be traced through Ancient and Renaissance philosophy, such as Socrates, Thomas Aquinas, Spinoza and Thomas Paine, the term ""social justice"" only became used explicitly from the 1840s. [...] From the early 20th century it was also embedded in international law and institutions, starting with the Treaty of Versailles 1919. The preamble to establish the International Labour Organization recalled that ""universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice."" In the later 20th century, social justice was made central to the philosophy of the social contract, primarily by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice (1971). In 1993, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action treats social justice as a purpose of the human rights education.  To the people bullshitting in this thread about social justice being communism or socialism: If you base your judgement on what social justice is on information you get from people who interpret it in an extreme and very one-sided way, you will have a very skewed view on what it actually is. Social justice is a valid philosophical and sociological concept that you can best judge when studying the different notions of justice and a just society. Social justice, while it may be an ideology in the sense that it's a normative theory, is not in itself a political movement.  Don't let yourselves be blinded by extremists."

Classically, ""justice"" (especially corrective justice or distributive justice) ensured that individuals both fulfilled their societal roles,  and received what was due from society. Social justice assigns rights and duties in the institutions of society, which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation.  The relevant institutions can include education, health care, social security, labour rights, as well as a broader system of public services, progressive taxation and regulation of markets, to ensure fair distribution of wealth, equal opportunity, equality of outcome, and no gross social injustice.
