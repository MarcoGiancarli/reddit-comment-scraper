QuotesPorn,3dy8oq,Mysterious_Drifter,41,Mon Jul 20 14:46:12 2015 UTC,"I was a lost, homeless, drunk, dishonest grifter in the 80s and I thought about suicide a lot, would have done society (at that time) a favor by doing so. Suicide was my friend, my ""break in case of emergency"" handle. I always knew my friend was there if ever things got too bad, and man they sure got bad. Got me through a bunch of nights, kept me warm. Glad I never needed to make that call. Glad today that I no longer need that friend."
QuotesPorn,3dy8oq,SIRPORKSALOT,7,Mon Jul 20 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not even depressed and I still think about suicide on many nights before going to sleep.  I think about who would attend my funeral and what they might say about me.  I wonder if it's just over after that or if my consciousness lives on in any form; and, if it does, would I be punished for ending it all prematurely and have to start back at the beginning?  Most of all, I think about the pain I would cause my friends and family, and I know I would never do it.  I've been real low before, and I always clawed my way back.  I know it can happen again."

QuotesPorn,3dy8oq,Maledicte,6,Mon Jul 20 23:49:24 2015 UTC,"The thought of suicide has been and continues to be a security blanket for me, for almost a decade now. It's one last out in case I just can't handle my issues anymore. It's something you keep close and hold tight on cold nights when you feel absolutely alone in the world, and don't see a way out. It's that one thing you feel you have control over, even if you've lost control of everything else."

QuotesPorn,3dmfjw,symzvius,8,Sat Jul 18 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"People love to bash anarchists as nothing more than teenagers living in their Mothers basement, but the truth is there are many great thinkers who are anarchists; Tolstoy, Jung, Weil, Ghandi, Orwell, and now it seems I can add Chaplin to that list. I actually suspected he was, just from when he said ""you have the love of humanity in your hearts!"" It's very reminiscent of parts of Tolstoys essay ON ANARCHY                                   On Anarchy   The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order and in the assertion that, without Authority there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that anarchy can be instituted by a violent revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power and by there being more and more people who will be ashamed of applying this power.  “The capitalistic organization will pass into the hands of workers, and then there will be no more oppression of these workers, and no unequal distribution of earnings.” [Marxist]  “But who will establish the works; who will administer them?” [Anarchist]  “It will go on of its own accord; the workmen themselves will arrange everything.” [Marxist]  “But the capitalistic organization was established just because, for every practical affair, there is need for administrators furnished with power. If there be work, there will be leadership, administrators with power. And when there is power, there will be abuse of it — the very thing against which you are now striving.” [Anarchist]  To the question, how to be without a State, without courts, armies, and so on, an answer cannot be given, because the question is badly formulated. The problem is not how to arrange a State after the pattern of today, or after a new pattern. Neither I, nor any of us, is appointed to settle that question. But, though voluntarily, yet inevitably must we answer the question, how shall I act faced with the problem which ever arises before me? Am I to submit my conscience to the acts taking place around me, am I to proclaim myself in agreement with the Government, which hangs erring men, sends soldiers to murder, demoralizes nations with opium and spirits, and so on, or am I to submit my actions to conscience, i.e., not participate in Government, the actions of which are contrary to reason?  What will be the outcome of this, what kind of a Government there will be — of all this I know nothing; not that I don’t wish to know; but that I cannot. I only know that nothing evil can result from my following the higher guidance of wisdom and love, or wise love, which is implanted in me, just as nothing evil comes of the bee following the instinct implanted in her, and flying out of the hive with the swarm, we should say, to ruin.[1] But, I repeat, I do not wish to and cannot judge about this.  In this precisely consists the power of Christ’s teaching and that not because Christ is God or a great man, but because His teaching is irrefutable. The merit of His teaching consists in the fact that it transferred the matter from the domain of eternal doubt and conjecture on to the ground of certainty. You are a man, a being rational and kind, and you know that today or tomorrow you will die, disappear. If there be a God then you will go to Him and He will ask of you an account of your actions, whether you have acted in accordance with His law, or, at least, with the higher qualities implanted in you. If there be no God, you regard reason and love as the highest qualities, and must submit to them your other inclinations, and not let them submit to your animal nature — to the cares about the commodities of life, to the fear of annoyance and material calamities.  The question is not, I repeat, which community will be the more secure, the better — the one which is defended by arms, cannons, gallows or the one that is not so safeguarded. But there is only one question for a man, and on it is impossible to evade: “Will you, a rational and good being, having for a moment appeared in this world, and at any moment liable to disappear — will you take part in the murder of erring men or men of a different race, will you participate in the extermination of whole nations of so-called savages, will you participate in the artificial deterioration of generations of men by means of opium and spirits for the sake of profit, will you participate in all these actions, or even be in agreement with those who permit them, or will you not?”  And there can be but one answer to this question for those to whom it has presented itself. As to what the outcome will be of it, I don’t know, because it is not given to me to know. But what should be done, I do unmistakably know. And if you ask: “What will happen?”, then I reply that good will certainly happen; because, acting in the way indicated by reason and love, I am acting in accordance with the highest law known to me. The situation of the majority of men, enlightened by true brotherly enlightenment, at present crushed by the deceit and cunning of usurpers, who are forcing them to ruin their own lives — this situation is terrible and appears hopeless.  Only two issues present themselves, and both are closed. One is to destroy violence by violence, by terrorism, dynamite bombs and daggers as our Nihilists and Anarchists have attempted to do, to destroy this conspiracy of Governments against nations, from without; the other is to come to an agreement with the Government, making concessions to it, participating in it, in order gradually to disentangle the net which is binding the people, and to set them free. Both these issues are closed. Dynamite and the dagger, as experience has already shown, only cause reaction, and destroy the most valuable power, the only one at our command, that of public opinion.  The other issue is closed, because Governments have already learnt how far they may allow the participation of men wishing to reform them. They admit only that which does not infringe, which is non-essential; and they are very sensitive concerning things harmful to them — sensitive because the matter concerns their own existence. They admit men who do not share their views, and who desire reform, not only in order to satisfy the demands of these men, but also in their own interest, in that of the Government. These men are dangerous to the Governments if they remain outside them and revolt against them — opposing to the Governments the only effective instrument the Governments possess — public opinion; they must therefore render these men harmless, attracting them by means of concessions, in order to render them innocuous (like cultivated microbes), and then make them serve the aims of the Governments, i.e., oppress and exploit the masses.  Both these issues being firmly closed and impregnable, what remains to be done?  To use violence is impossible; it would only cause reaction. To join the ranks of the Government is also impossible — one would only become its instrument. One course therefore remains — to fight the Government by means of thought, speech, actions, life, neither yielding to Government nor joining its ranks and thereby increasing its power.  This alone is needed, will certainly be successful.  And this is the will of God, the teaching of Christ. There can be only one permanent revolution — a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.  How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it will take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in himself. And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of changing himself.  Leo Tolstoy 1900"

QuotesPorn,3dmfjw,sunkistnsudafed,13,Mon Jul 20 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"It's very reminiscent of Leo Tolstoys philosophies, heres an excerpt from his book The Kingdom of God is Within You...  ""To suggest to governments that they should not have recourse to violence, but should decide their misunderstandings inaccordance with equity, is inviting them to abolish themselves as rulers, and that no government can ever consent to do.  [T]he specialty of government is not to obey, but to enforce obedience. And a government is only a government so long as it can make itself obeyed, and therefore it always strives for that and will never willingly abandon its power. But since it is on the army that the power of government rests, it will never give up the army, and the use of the army in war.  The error arises from the learned jurists deceiving themselves and others, by asserting that government is not what it really is, one set of men banded together to oppress another set of men, but, as shown by science, is the representation of the citizens in their collective capacity. They have so long been persuading other people of this that at last they have persuaded themselves of it; and thus they often seriously suppose that government can be bound by considerations of justice. But history shows that from Caesar to Napoleon, and from Napoleon to Bismarck, government is in its essence always a force acting in violation of justice, and that it cannot be otherwise. Justice can have no binding force on a ruler or rulers who keep men, deluded and drilled in readiness for acts of violence — soldiers, and by means of them control others. And so governments can never be brought to consent to diminish the number of these drilled slaves, who constitute their whole power and importance.  Such is the attitude of certain learned men to the contradiction under which our society is being crushed, and such are their methods of solving it. Tell these people that the whole matter rests on the personal attitude of each man to the moral and religious question put nowadays to everyone, the question, that is, whether it is lawful or unlawful for him to take his share of military service, and these learned gentlemen will shrug their shoulders and not condescend to listen or to answer you.  The solution of the question in their idea is to be found in reading addresses, writing books, electing presidents, vice-presidents, and secretaries, and meeting and speaking first in one town and then in another. From all this speechifying and writing it will come to pass, according to their notions, that governments will cease to levy the soldiers, on whom their whole strength depends, will listen to their discourses, and will disband their forces, leaving themselves without any defense, not only against their neighbors, but also against their own subjects. As though a band of brigands, who have some unarmed travelers bound and ready to be plundered, should be so touched by their complaints of the pain caused by the cords they are fastened with as to let them go again.  Still there are people who believe in this, busy themselves over peace congresses, read addresses, and write books. And governments, we may be quite sure, express their sympathy and make a show of encouraging them. In the same way they pretend to support temperance societies, while they are living principally on the drunkenness of the people; and pretend to encourage education, when their whole strength is based on ignorance; and to support constitutional freedom, when their strength rests on the absence of freedom; and to be anxious for the improvement of the condition of the working classes, when their very existence depends on their oppression; and to support Christianity, when Christianity destroys all government.  To be able to do this they have long ago elaborated methods encouraging temperance, which cannot suppress drunkenness; methods of supporting education, which not only fail to prevent ignorance, but even increase it; methods of aiming at freedom and constitutionalism, which are no hindrance to despotism; methods of protecting the working classes, which will not free them from slavery; and a Christianity, too, they have elaborated, which does not destroy, but supports governments.  Now there is something more for the government to encourage — peace. The sovereigns, who nowadays take counsel with their ministers, decide by their will alone whether the butchery of millions is to be begun this year or next. They know very well that all these discourses upon peace will not hinder them from sending millions of men to butchery when it seems good to them. They listen even with satisfaction to these discourses, encourage them, and take part in them.  All this, far from being detrimental, is even of service to governments, by turning people’s attention from the most important and pressing question: Ought or ought not each man called upon for military service to submit to serve in the army?  “Peace will soon be arranged, thanks to alliances and congresses, to books and pamphlets; meantime go and put on your uniform, and prepare to cause suffering and to endure it for our benefit,” is the government’s line of argument. And the learned gentlemen who get up congresses and write articles are in perfect agreement with it… And since it [this attitude] is that most beneficial to governments, it is also the most encouraged by all intelligent governments.

QuotesPorn,3digzj,llBradll,3,Fri Jul 17 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as complacency. Learning who you are takes a lot of introspection and honestly about how you are perceived. Becoming happy about those observation often requires adjusting the parts of your behavior and outlook that cause your grief or shame. Living inauthentically, or not as you are, can mean following the example or motivations of an external voice and it takes effort to quiet that voice.   I appreciate some say screw it, I am who I am, and that attitude fits this platitude but I don't think it's the intended spirit of the message."

QuotesPorn,3digzj,roasted_flamingo,4,Fri Jul 17 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"What is ""who you are""? What is this? How does one find it?"
QuotesPorn,3digzj,Voltenion,6,Thu Jul 16 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"I would say that ""who you are"" includes things like your values, your passions, areas where you feel comfortable/uncomfortable, even your sense of humor and the way you like to interact with people. It's the idea of figuring out how you want to live your life in this world where nobody really knows what is right (because nothing/everything is). How do you want to spend your limited number of days on Earth?   I think you figure these things out by having experiences in the world (which is easy) and then evaluating those experiences (which is not) to determine what went well and what didn't, and if you want to steer your future experiences in that direction or not.  At this point it may not sound too complicated, but the challenge appears when you realize how many outside influences are trying to make their own suggestions about who you are. Parents, friends, TV shows, these all present ideas about what is good and bad, often without taking into account the fact that you are not them. But they are probably not living their own lives the way they want either! So their guidance is not going to be super golden, to say the least.  The difficulty is searching your own feelings to find guidance, which is where the second part of the quote comes in. For most people (everybody), one of the most important desires we have is to be loved by other people, and we often associate the idea of ""earning love"" with doing what others ask of us. This leads us to sacrifice being the person we really are to be the person who makes other people happy. This gets us into all kinds of shit that really never ends with us being happy with ourselves. I can go into more detailed examples of this in another comment if it helps.  Basically, I interpret this quote as ultimately saying that to be truly happy, we must first figure out how to live life in our own unique way. Once we figure this out, we start to see all the things we are afraid of, that are keeping us from acting how we really want. Then the (second greatest) challenge is to forgive ourselves for all that fear, at which point we can live by our feelings of true love and peace."
QuotesPorn,3digzj,Redequlus,2,Thu Jul 16 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with /u/Voltenion's skepticism here. Your values, passions and character never stop changing. If you find yourself at 18, you'll laugh about it at 30 and again at 50.  In my humble opinion, finding yourself is realising that there is nothing that defines you, there are only your thoughts and actions."
QuotesPorn,3digzj,SirRichardVanEsquire,2,Fri Jul 17 08:27:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't disagree with you. You don't always think the same way throughout your life, but my main point was that you figure out your biggest fears that are holding you back from doing what you want. Once you have learned how to deal with those, that ability never goes away. So even if your values change completely, you don't forget how to live in integrity with your decisions.   I wouldn't use the term 'define' because that implies there are some aspects that characterize you more than others, when you would really need to summarize every single facet of yourself, at which point you are defined as 'you'. I think 'discovering who you are' is more about sort of writing a manual on how to best operate yourself, and that will absolutely change many times throughout your life. The key is gaining the skills that allow you to understand those changes without difficulty or struggle."

There's a limited sense in which this is true; it's important to be honest with oneself about one's own actions, patterns, neuroses, etc. But fundamentally, that stuff doesn't constitute ""who you are"" in any real sense. Go find that essence and it is a VERY different story.   So yeah, do some journaling, sit in meditation, go for a walk, do whatever it is that helps you see through yourself and get comfortable with the shadowy parts. And then try some direct inquiry and snap yourself out of the dream ;-)"

Sure some unpleasant things come up, but keep digging. That shameful memory from the past is a part of you, but so is the part of you that sees that memory as shameful. Maybe there was inner-conflict at the time too. So who are you really?   When you dig down and find that deepest part—past the fears, needs, and desires—it will not be a disappointment. And maybe it's not so much like waking up from a dream as it is like going through the looking glass ;-)"

QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,Mysterious_Drifter,101,Wed Jul 15 22:51:20 2015 UTC,"“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”"

QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,TheEveningDragon,12,Thu Jul 16 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's from his first novel, written in 1938 and published in 1971 (more than ten years after his death) titled A Happy Death.  Here is the full quote:   The next morning, Mersault killed Zagreus, came home, and slept all afternoon. He awakened in a fever. That evening, still in bed, he sent for the neighborhood doctor, who told him he had grippe. A man from his office who had come to find out what was the matter took Mersault’s resignation to Monsieur Langlois. A few days later, everything was settled: an article in the newspaper, an investigation. There was every motive for Zagreus’ action. Marthe came to see Mersault and said with a sigh: “Sometimes there are days when you’d like to change places with him. But sometimes it takes more courage to live than to shoot yourself.”   Remember that Camus was French, so this quote carries some translation-baggage. I apologise for not posting this information sooner."

For a person who's on the verge of suicide, it's much harder and scarier to live. And for a person who isn't suicidal, it's much harder and scarier to kill themselves.  On top of that, for the suicidal person, killing themselves can still be scary. For the non-suicidal person, going on with life can sometimes be scary, as well.  My take away from this is that it's just a sad fact that life is so full of many extremely scary and painful situations. And we should do what we can (even if you feel you don't have much power, you can still do little things that add up) to improve life."

You do exactly that by arguing that they ""convinced themselves"", essentially stating that wishing for death is some delusion that people (willingly?) bring on themselves. But who decides what makes life worthwhile, if not the individual? So when someone decides that their life is not worthwhile, that it lacks the basic notions of humanity and dignity, whatever those may be constituted by for the individual, who are you to tell them that they are wrong?"
QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,blacksnow67,-4,Thu Jul 16 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"So essentially, being suicidal is a good thing because it's an expression of personal freedom? No. I was the first one in saying that it's the individual itself that has the choice to make his own life worthwhile, so I'm clearly not saying that I know better - stop implying it. What I said is that if one finds his own life not worthwhile, he has to make it so himself; it's rather unlikely that some sacred epiphany of will to live is going to drop on his head from the skies. That is in no way saying that I know what it's best for them or that I'm judging them - I'm just refusing to justify suicide or to blame one's disgraces on the world and deem them unsolvable."

It is not up to you or anyone else to judge it, is what I am saying. By asserting that it is either good or bad (eg. ""refusing to justify suicide"") you do that. Arguing that one has to make their life worthwhile is precisely what I disagree with here - you conclude that for yourself, but do not tell someone who has come to the conclusion that his or her life is not worthwhile what they have to do.   Personally, there are numerous situations which I would downright refuse to endure - neurodegenerative illness, torture, severe disability, the list goes on. Some people suffer through all that and live on, and I have nothing but respect for those people. But I would never, not one second, consider doing so myself. Would you tell people in the above situations that ""they have to make their life worthwhile""? And if they refused? If they tried, however unsuccessfully to kill themselves?

If we had abode by these maxims, philosophy would have had a very short life. By the way, by saying that I can't ""judge"" or express what I think is right (because as a matter of fact I have no way of enforcing it, nor have I expressed the will to do so), aren't you judging me yourself, going by your own assessment?

I don't refuse the idea of death, nor that it could be a valid reason to inflict it upon oneself (and perhaps in some cases even on others! Although this is another matter), what I refuse is the idea of giving up on oneself (or ""on life"", whatever wording you prefer). If there is a major reason justifying the choice to end one's life (such as a serious illness) it may be justified to do it if the individual really doesn't feel like he can carry on in his condition, but if the reason is merely and solely emotive then no, I wouldn't find it just at all. Whether what I find just is important or not is another matter: if we only listened to opinions that ""mattered"" we might as well toss our keyboards and tongues in the nearest bin."

QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,qwerty1234444,0,Thu Jul 16 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not pretending that suicidal thoughts come through rational thinking, if that's the impression you got. I know that in practice, rationality does not help by itself. I've been through a troubled childhood and in my early teenage years I also had some suicidal instincts when the worst problems were unfolding - granted I was still a child, but nevertheless I know enough to be sure that, as I said towards the start of this argument, individual willpower isn't enough to fight something like this."
QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,itaShadd,2,Thu Jul 16 20:27:14 2015 UTC,"If that is the case then I would like to rescind my comment about the logical nature of your argument because of the contradiction you have created here. If suicidal thoughts are not born through rational thinking, how can one look to the rational process of creating meaning in one's own life as a solution. And how can you condemn suicide that is strictly due to ""emotive"" factors, and then recognize the irrationality of those emotions? (Not to mention that one might argue that your concept of creating one's own meaning seems some what arbitrary, and, to a person in a depressive state, might come off as simply creating a personal delusion to distract one's self from the meaningless void that is our existence)"
QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,blacksnow67,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I did not talk about suicide specifically at the start of the argument, I talked about ""seeing one's life as finished"" - if it's due to mental illness or instability it's obviously out of the individual's control, so clearly he can't be expected to take choices rationally. If that sentiment is not due to clinical issues, then we might assume that he's in full conscience of his thoughts."
QuotesPorn,3dfsw6,itaShadd,0,Thu Jul 16 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"Respecting individual's choices in something as fundamental as the question whether life is worth living? Yeah, philosophy would not survive one more day if we start doing that. You can state whatever you want, but you will have to deal with criticism of that. I think that the position you hold towards the matter is disrespectful towards people who are suicidal and I think that it causes a great deal of harm - because, while it is possible that you neither can nor want to enforce it, you are a part of society, and society can and wants to.

I think that the position you hold towards the matter is disrespectful towards people who are suicidal and I think that it causes a great deal of harm - because, while it is possible that you neither can nor want to enforce it, you are a part of society, and society can and wants to.   You're remixing my words as you please, at this point. I think it's pretty clear that what I was referring to was not respecting individual choices but rather your banning of opinions and judgements a priori. If judging is wrong as you seem to imply, one would have to accept any and every decision an individual makes, regardless of its nature, because ""it's not up to others to judge individual choices"". Everybody has the right to judge whatever he wants and express his thoughts if he so desires - opinions and judgements may not always be shared but this doesn't make them less legitimate. I don't refuse to deal with criticism, opinions are bound to be criticised, but I won't accept being said that I should express my opinions.  And no, I don't think I'm being disrespectful towards suicidal people. From what I'm gathering, what you would consider respectful would be accepting that they want to end their lives because ""it's their choice"". If that's what you think, I disagree; if it's not, then please clarify. I'm also interested in knowing what exactly is offensive towards suicidal people in what I expressed, because I fail to see it. Would stopping a random stranger from jumping in front of a train be disrespectful towards him? Or even just being willing to stop him if the circumstances arose, considering I didn't speak of taking any kind of action; at this point I'm basically becoming the bad guy because I don't want any hypothetical person to take his own life. This seems rather absurd to me.   Well, I am delighted to read that we are on the same page here, so let me expand on the point I made above. You state yourself that there are situations in which suicide is a valid response, but who decides that exactly? What is valid, what is not? Illness, torture - all valid you say, but many people kill themselves for other reasons. Is depression valid? Poverty? Honor? A broken heart? Do you decide that? Does society?   As I said, if the individual is capable of good reasoning, he can decide himself - case in point: I get diagnosed with cancer, incurable, I have less than some months to live. Rather than suffer in an hospital for a lot of time, I decide to end my life ahead of time. This would be acceptable in my book. If however the individual is deemed (by professionals, since we do have them at this point of our scientific progress) not able to be completely rational, someone else would have to have the last word on the matter, be that the closest relatives, the law or whatever (surely not me as in /u/itaShadd; you keep repeating this concept as if I ever said I was in charge of anything, when in fact I only did the opposite - having an opinion is not the same as claiming power). Many countries already have laws regulating euthanasia, so discussing it here in these terms would be superfluous at best. Back to the topic: depression may or may not influence the way an individual thinks, to the point of potentially making him think of suicide, but since it's a condition that influences reasoning itself, can we be sure it is the individual speaking, or is it his depression? All other matters in his life staying the same, can we be sure that without being depressed he would contemplate suicide all the same? I can't give a final answer to this question because I'm not a psychologist, neurologist or any other relevant kind of specialist, so I won't try to answer it, but my uneducated opinion is that if depression could influence such a decision to this extent, allowing euthanasia would be wrong.  Also, as a strictly realistic addendum: regardless of the reason behind it, if someone decides to end his own life and succeeds, whatever we might think about it being a justifiable act or not is irrelevant and wouldn't change anything practical."

This is so common that Thomas Joiner (a leading suicide researcher) made ""perception of burdensomeness"" a key element of his revised model of suicide risk. I know that when I was suicidal, I was convinced that I was a cancer on the lives of everyone who knew me, and it would be so much better for them when I was gone because they could just grieve for me and move on and not be held back/troubled by how ill I was anymore. In fact, one of the huge hurdles I had to get over in recovering from my suicidal ideation was the guilt I felt at staying alive and remaining a burden on my loved ones - I honestly thought that killing myself would be what was best for them and staying alive was selfish. I have heard other suicidal people describe similar states of mind. Suicide is not usually the product of a rational mind, people who are suicidal often have a very skewed perception of reality."

I think it's simply more comfortable to believe suicide and depression are illogical, even if that usually isn't the case. Chronically depressed people tend to have an objectively more accurate view of their situation than people that aren't depressed.   It actually makes sense if you think about it - there's obviously a evolutionary basis for depression, otherwise it would've been weeded out of the gene pool long ago. It's an opportunity to take stock of your situation without the distortion of ego.   You can read up on it a bit here in the New York Times Magazine."

I guess it depends on what you mean by ""more accurate"", too. I can buy that a depressed person's assessment of how much the world sucks may be accurate, but the decision to kill oneself because things won't change or they think they can't recover (hopelessness) is pretty irrational, and the idea that family members would suffer less from losing you than they would from having you stay alive is pretty irrational as well. The fact that most people who survive a suicide attempt don't go on to complete it (research has show this, I can get citations for you later if you want) is a good indicator that their desire to kill themselves is pretty irrational - if jt was a good, logical choice then you wouldn't imagine that their justification for it would change after therapy."

It's a cool field of thought, really. But Camus, who always admired Sartre, died thinking that such a train of thought squandered the beauty of life."

Anybody that's taken psychedelics before knows what he's talking about.
QuotesPorn,3di12s,Sketch257,3,Thu Jul 16 21:53:00 2015 UTC,"""The psychedelics are a red-hot social issue, ethical issue, whatever the term for it is, and it is precisely because they are a deconditioning agents: they will cast doubt in you if you are a Hasidic rabbi, a Marxist anthropologist, or an altar boy, because their business is to dissolve belief systems, and they do this very well and then they leave you with the raw datum of experience, what William James called in infants 'the blooming, buzzing experience.' And out of that you reconstruct the world, and you need to understand that it is a dialog where your decisions, the projection of your grammar onto the intellectual space in front of you, is going to gel into the mode of being. We actually create our own universe because we are all operating with our own private languages."" -Terence McKenna"

The full quote might answer your question a little better:  ""Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone, and the only one who seeks out another. His nature – if that word can be used in reference to man, who has 'invented' himself by saying 'no' to nature – consists in his longing to realize himself in another. Man is nostalgia and a search for communion. Therefore, when he is aware of himself he is aware of his lack of another, that is, of his solitude."""

Consider that there are thousands of comments there per video, and consider that in today's internet, comments make up the bulk of content.  Those comments are often hateful, needlessly antagonistic, full of prejudice, or from people who are obviously starved for attention.  And I'm not even talking about the hateful pockets of the internet that promote bigotry and violence.

We see the witch hunts, we see people ignoring science, and condemning those that think differently. We see persecution, and wars over racism.   Every once in a while, someone can rise up and move people to change in a positive way, and then we assassinate them.   But if you ever say anything like that about people in present day, they will think you're full of shit.   And everybody knows the world is full of stupid people, and that they are not one of them.   If they think differently, well they must be wrong, especially if I don't like the idea.  Reddit is a slice of humanity, and it is biased towards the lower section of sort of wisdom, for the most part. I mean, the highest achieving and the most brilliant humans, aren't really on reddit, because they don't have time. Except maybe for an AMA.

I'm just saying a lot of talented people are lazy.   edit: And I'm not trying to say that laziness/idleness is necessarily bad. I suspect one needs it every so often to recuperate and replenish before one's reservoir of inspiration completely burns away. It's a balance I guess, like anything else."

But obviously there are many factors that come in to play as to whether someone is successful or not.   Hardwork is necessary for success, but I think there are very few brilliant people on reddit nonetheless.   By definition there are already few brilliant people in the world, and these people have such a large advantage over others, but that does mean they will all be successful. Lots of people that are less brilliant are incredibly successful also, because hard work makes a big difference.   That doesn't change the fact that there are very few brilliant people on reddit."

I think materialism attaches itself to things were' already fundamentally interested in.  You could be big into zen meditation, which requires nothing but a spot on the ground to sit.  Even then, you may end up looking at zafus and seizas, and you may start building a deck to overlook a rock garden, and you may buy a ticket to a mediation retreat, etc., etc.  You can't look at the materialism and say that Zen is, itself, materialistic.

However, if a bunch of people tell you you're behaving like a dick, you might want to reconsider your behavior.   There is nothing wrong with trying to get along with other people, fitting into the current scene, and that means adhering to accepted social norms.

I totally agree with you, I feel the more people's behaviour is brought to their attention, the more they can learn and grow.   On the latter I agree as well but feel like people feel afraid to show or tell who they really are by immediate social norms. It is good to adhere to a degree but whilst maintaining your individuality. Of course outward appearance is scrutinized and idolized as well because people see it and believe it. Whenever I hear someone judge someone else based on appearance I feel responsible to inform them of the many situations that person can be in.  Some people lack empathy. Some people lack the ability to perceive what a rude comment tells about themself. On the flip, if that same person heard that about themselves it would shatter them. It's this solipsistic narcissistic world people living in like they are the only things that matter in this world that is a huge problem."

QuotesPorn,3d8sip,ExodusWM,33,Tue Jul 14 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"""We have to stop CONSUMING our culture. We have to CREATE culture. DON'T watch TV, DON'T read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your OWN roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are — NOW — is the most immediate sector of your universe. And if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered. You're giving it all away to ICONS. Icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that, you want to dress like X or have lips like Y... This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion. What is real is you, and your friends, your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And, we are told No, you're unimportant, you're peripheral — get a degree, get a job, get a this, get that, and then you're a player. You don't even want to play that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world."" - Terrence McKenna"
QuotesPorn,3d8sip,Cybrosis,9,Tue Jul 14 16:29:24 2015 UTC,I like this quote but there's quite a lot of irony in it.  The message is not to worry about admiring or listening to what others say  you should do.  But the only way to understand this quote is to admire and listen to what he says.

QuotesPorn,3d8sip,TheOldGods,14,Wed Jul 15 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"What? This...this is dumb. Stop consuming culture? That's ridiculous. Why would you give up the joys of reading a book or listening to music? Just because you don't create some form of media doesn't mean you're a mindless automaton stuffing your proverbial face. I mean, maybe make a better judgement call about whats worth spending your time on but this sort of broad attack on all media comes off as childish to me.  The more I read this quote the more it seems like something most of us would say when going through a rebellious phase during middle school. What an absurd simplification of an exquisitely complex system.    And, we are told No, you're unimportant, you're peripheral - get a degree, get a job, get a this, get that, and then you're a player. You don't even want to play that game.   Ergh. No, we all work in a system that encourages uhhh jobs and education. That's not a bad thing. You can argue wage labor is bad or that the setup of education in x place isn't great but this is just fucking ridiculous. What fucking game? The game of society? Is this dude an anarcho-primitivist or something?   You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world   Look. You should have a solid grip on what kind of culture you're ""consuming"" and you should be mindful of the influence it's having on you (as mindful as you can be since we're all, Mr. McKenna included, heavily heavily shaped by our culture). And you should recognize that advertising is a very effective strategy of selling things in our society. But don't make a huge sweeping statement on how all of the media is ruining everything and we're all just sheep and the man is trying to control your mind and turn you into a moron. A lot of people, myself included, aren't a big fan of the gossip that's on TV. Fine - let's help push away from that by creating AND CONSUMING more educational content.

Maybe that aggressive counter culture period is something some of us have to go through.  You know like... IF we are brought up to believe that consumption is the first and last answer, that we do need beauty magazines and... I don't know, whatever the fuck else he's talking about back there, then maybe before we can start to make judgements about what we will and won't consume, first comes a flat out rejection of all which is ""fed to us"", to use a colloquialism that I think is in the spirit of the passage.  After flat out rejection comes before gradual reintroduction of what is consumable. Having fasted from the consumable culture, one can pick what one wants.  ""Reality television? Gyegh, no thank you.""  ""Taco Bell? Hey that's alright actually!""  ""Beauty Magazines? I don't like this, but there is something here I DO like. An idea the magazine fails to grasp and convey. I want to explore this.""  It's just a thought. That though this attitude is not really more or less mature than blatant consumption, it at least creates an anchor on the opposite, in the hopes that our middle schooler will have a more fruitful time trying to find the middle ground which suits him."

I mean come on guys, the subreddit is literally called ""quotes porn"".

Bear in mind I have no context here, if you are more familiar with this hancock fellow, you might have a more complex understanding than I do.  What I'm saying is, it is entirely possible that people who do not take part in this machine are shunned, even though more and more people are not taking part in it.

A connection in this sense could just be a supportive friend, not necessarily a business connection who would be willing to trade favors.   The point of the quote is that nobody gets to where they are alone. People vastly overestimate the amount of direct control they have over their circumstances, which is really just a form of narcissism. Experiences play just as crucial a role in shaping a person as genetics, and it's not like you're exactly responsible for those, either."

I don't think success, in any market or economic system, comes completely off the backs of others, in the same way I don't think success comes entirely by the will of the successful person.  With all that said, I would like to see an example of your ""cooperatively owned"" economy. I use quotes not to mock, but because in my opinion all economies are cooperatively owned by the agents that act in them.  Edit: Also, is your assertion that capitalism is the only system where people profit off of eachother? Or possibly that capitalism causes or necessitates persons profiting off of each other?"

I wonder though, is it not asymmetrical information that allows for exploitation? And furthermore, since symmetrical information cannot exist in any market structure, won't all markets invariably lead to the exploitation of someone (whether it's buyers/sellers of labor or goods/services)? Does any existence of consumer or producer surplus constitute exploitation as a result of asymmetrical information?  It seems exploitation becomes harder to identify when you account for objective value and pricing systems, no?  Edit: Added another question at the end of the second paragraph"

And furthermore, since symmetrical information cannot exist in any market structure, won't all markets invariably lead to the exploitation of someone (whether it's buyers/sellers of labor or goods/services)?   This is an excellent question. I made a distinction between capitalism and markets because I do believe they are separate. But many anti-capitalists are anti-market for this exact reason, that they believe markets are also inherently exploitive. I do not think (under capitalism) that asymmetrical information is the primary driver of exploitation. Even if both parties have equal information, one party has access to the means of production, and the other doesn't, so even with equal information one party has significantly greater bargaining power than the other.  I do think that exploitation would still exist in a theoretical cooperatively-owned market, but it would not be working class exploitation by the ownership class as those classes would then be one and the same."

I can't agree with him any more strongly. Connor clearly didn't achieve anything by himself.  Before he faught in the ufc I was a fan, he was very impressive as a fighter.

But I guess when you got your career on a silver platter you'll get a belt on one too.  Like everyone else I like rooting for the underdog, but I also like cheering for fighters that have worked for everything they have achieved. Seeing a fighter with a golden ticket holding onto daddy Dana's pocket the whole ride; getting gifted with easy fights and then awarded a bullshit interim belt is a disgrace to the sport. MMA is a sport, not a drama like the WWE where the only thing that matters is how much money a personality/mouth draws in."
QuotesPorn,3d2j0g,Lee355,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:35:15 2015 UTC,"Nobody really considers it a real belt though, everyone knows that to be considered the genuine champ he needs to beat Aldo. What's he supposed to say? ""No please don't make this fight count for the interim belt, it's not fair?"" I mean I'm a dyed in the wool Irish McGregor nuthugger. I consider him the number 1 contender right now, and while a case for Edgar could be made, I don't think his case is as strong as McGregor's, as he's already had title shots gifted to him also.  I agree, beating Siver doesn't warrant a title shot. Now he has the real title shot. This comes on the back of beating Siver, Holloway, Poirier, and now Mendes in the way he did. If that's not enough to deserve a title shot then I don't know what else you expect him to do. He's beaten everyone that's been put in front of him.   I can understand people being annoyed at the UFC for calling this an interim belt though, it's purely a marketing tool. Dismissing McGregor's wins as being easy fights is just silly. Sure the UFC could have made harder fights for him at times, but what he has done in the fights that he's been presented with has been impressive."

Now in Europe you can all over on the trains. The public transportation in Germany is phenomenal. But here only our absolute largest cities have metro systems, and those don't get you outside your city. I live in the midwest. If this was Europe you could take a quick train from Milwaukee to Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus? Etc. I live in Columbus and for being one of the top 15 largest cities our public transportation seems archaic. I was in S. Korea and they had all sorts of means to get anywhere you want. It was crowded in Seoul,  but for being much larger than NYC it felt controlled, with way less honking. Hell, their parking garages will move your car and park it automatically. You retrieve it like a vending machine. It is more efficient in terms of space. I just feel that compared to a lot of our industrialized counterparts we are following behind in infastructure.  I mean, think about how many orange barrels you see while driving around. Some have been there for years. Our public sector leaves much to be desired sometime.

None of the others who are above us have this national rail system as you describe either, because it's simply not feasible to run a train system for transportation across such huge stretches. This is why public transit is left to each municipality on how to handle it. Atlanta, GA, for example, has (*had? Apparently it's been downgraded since I lived there...sad times) a very effective public transit system.  It's easy to argue ""South Korea's rail system is exquisite!"" because the whole damn country is about the same size as the state of Indiana, and if you'll notice, the exact same thing can be said of every other country that has been mentioned in this thread about countries with ""amazing public transit""...they're all extremely small countries.  edit: Yes.

QuotesPorn,3cyc49,jdepps113,5,Sun Jul 12 03:50:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's largely nonsense.  The US has the most extensive system of superhighways in the world, even if we don't have as much passenger rail as Europe.  The demand for the rail just isn't there, except in cities with subways."
QuotesPorn,3cyc49,willOTW,-2,Sun Jul 12 10:05:29 2015 UTC,"Just not true at all, and you proved this yourself with your comment on the extensive highways. There had always been heavy rail demand and commercial rails still do heavy business. It was when the government began subsidizing the highways that made cars and suburban homes affordable that the passenger railroads found it hard to compete."
QuotesPorn,3cyc49,jdepps113,3,Sun Jul 12 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"Amtrak is one of the most subsidized things there is, and they still can't get their ridership up to high levels.  No doubt that the superhighways killed rail, but it wasn't just because the government threw money at them; it was because people preferred them as a cheaper and more convenient alternative.  Even today it's cheaper to get a city-to-city bus ride on a Chinatown bus, or even to get a cheap flight across the country (which is obviously much faster), than it is to ride Amtrak.  People only hop on a train when they want to enjoy the ride and soak in the scenery, but not as the cheapest and/or fastest way to get to their destination.  I like rail and wouldn't mind more of it, but I think it's preposterous to claim that if we don't have a lot of it, despite having extensive and convenient transportation options, that it means we're not as developed as countries that went more heavily on rail and don't necessarily have as much in the way of major roads.  EDIT: One redundant word."
QuotesPorn,3cyc49,willOTW,0,Sun Jul 12 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"but it wasn't just because the government threw money at them; it was because people preferred them as a cheaper and more convenient alternative.   The highways are what subsidized this suburban lifestyle. It includes other issues like white flight, but they were only made economically feasible by the massive highway system that was built as well as cheap oil and a baby boom.   People only hop on a train when they want to enjoy the ride and soak in the scenery, but not as the cheapest and/or fastest way to get to their destination.   Not true, I have taken Amtrack as a cheaper option before, although it was barely so.  Amtrack is subsidized, but not in a way that lets it be competitive nationally with the highway system and that is 100% on purpose.   but I think it's preposterous to claim that if we don't have a lot of it   You are correct, we have one the the most extensive commercial train systems in the world.   that it means we're not as developed as countries that went more heavily on rail and don't necessarily have as much in the way of major roads   Europe transportation system is much better for commuters. Airfare is cheaper, trains run locally, nationally and internationally and they still manage to have an extensive road system (best example of which is Germany).  The reason for the USA not having an expansive commuter rail system is largely political, not economic. That's not to say it wouldn't cost a large amount of money, just that that money is not politically feasible."

QuotesPorn,3cyc49,Auburn530,7,Sun Jul 12 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"Once again /r/quotesporn concentrates on the words rather than the meaning.   Yes, public transportation isn't very feasible in much of the US.  That's not the important message in the quote.  The distinction in the quote between a developed nation and a merely wealthy one is that a developed nation has such good public services (like public transportation but also things like health care, education, etc) that even those with the means to afford more will use them.  A merely wealthy nation will have these systems, but they will be so poorly maintained that only the poor would consider using them, and then only as an option of last resort.  I think there is definitely some truth in the statement that the US is not a developed nation.  We developed greatly until about the 60 and 70s, then started to stagnate.  Sure, we're richer than ever and our technology has advanced by leaps and bounds, but our society has stagnated.  We don't use our advanced technology for anything really new (on any great scale), we're just better at what we've been doing since the 70s.  We have the best hospitals in the world, yet our national health has been surpassed by other nations.  We're home to the greatest system of higher education on Earth but we're bankrupting an entire generation to access it.  We hold a vast majority of the world's stealth in the hands of a few citizens.  You could certainly argue that qualifies us as wealthy but undeveloped."

I was in a pretty bad depression for 8+ years, it took therapy and practice to understand the things I was doing to keep myself feeling the way I was feeling. Obviously it's not as simple as saying ""be happy"" - but that's not what this quote is saying. At least for me, it was creating routines that left me feeling the same shitty way for years.

Yes, I agree that habits contribute (either positively or negatively) greatly to overall wellbeing, but what gets to me sometimes is oversimplification. With the 'it's your own responsibility' attitude that works wonders for many, comes the 'it's your own fault' connotation that might leads some people deeper down the rabbit hole of depression through overanalyses. Also, some people (perhaps not you) actually have a 'disability' with their brain chemistry: a purely physical condition that makes them depressed even as a little child.  What do you think?"

Most of the theories out there have something to do with increased awareness about girls' education and thus more focus put on girls by teachers.

I'd also recommend reading Camus' philosophical essay, The Myth of Sisyphus which can be found online here.   Here is the full context of the quote:   It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration."

Here is the full quote:   When I was very young and in the cave of Trophonius I forgot to laugh. Then, when I got older, when I opened my eyes and saw the real world, I began to laugh and I haven’t stopped since. I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood, that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge, that the bright joy of love was to marry a well-off girl, that the blessing of friendship was to help each other out of a financial tight spot, that wisdom was what the majority said it was, that passion was to give a speech, that courage was to risk being fined 10 rix-dollars, that cordiality was to say ‘You’re welcome’ after a meal, and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year. That’s what I saw. And I laughed.   To be ""in the cave of Trophonius"" means to be suffering a great fright."

We have come so far and to go back to violence wouldn't solve anything. In fact it would make things drastically worse. That is a fight which needn't be fought with weapons but if fought with weapons becomes unwinnable. It also means a lot of innocents get hurt, and nothing turns the average man or woman away from your cause then blindly hurting innocents with little to no remorse."
QuotesPorn,3ck9mx,caboose309,3,Thu Jul 9 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. -Malcolm X   This is Malcolm on the issue of violence and nonviolence. What part of following Malcolm would be a mistake today? Malcolm's ideology wasn't advocating violence with weapons. He advocated black power and self defense and unification within the black community and told us how black clergy men were being used against the black revolution. When Dr. King said nonviolence during his marches, it meant don't attack the aggressor back. Stay peaceful regardless. Malcolm said that is foolish. Kwame Toure (formerly Stokely Carmichael) who was president of the Student non violence Coordinating Committee, while literally marching alongside King said he didn't think nonviolence was a viable way of life. Those on the committee carried guns to protect themselves. King was against this until his house got bombed, then he went to get one. I along with most people I know would agree with Malcolm. King had some good philosophy such as economic withdraw, but for many people he was too moderate, too reformist and I agree. It relies on white legislators to have a conscious. Looking at the last 50 years of America showing King's philosophy down our throat in order to pacify us, I've had enough of it. I agree that this isn't a gun fight (although I do believe arming the people is a necessity) but I side with Malcolm over King on most issues. King lacks the militancy I see necessary."

If you become active militants then you will have to deal not only with the police but the army and national guard, that is a battle that cannot be won. I sincerely hope you think about militantism and the negative impacts an unwinnable war would have."
QuotesPorn,3ck9mx,caboose309,4,Thu Jul 9 16:53:03 2015 UTC,You seem to equate Malcolm and militancy as some sort of gun war. You're mistaken. Malcolm simply didn't advocate what you think he does.   Militancy does not mean get more guns. It means you do not approach your ideology in a passive manner. A militant atheist is not one who goes out with a Scar-L talking about death to Christians. You need not pick up a weapon to be a militant black activist.

I am very clear on what is wanted, and that's the highest profit margin possible. We live in a staunchly capitalist society. Africans were brought to America to advance the economy, this is clear. You say they don't want to keep the black man down but they do. Because it generates money. Black is and has always been the target demographic for the capitalist state. America's concessions to blacks in office does not mean systematic racism is not an issue that needs to be combated. American capitalism has always come at the expense of the black race, from slavery to Jim Crow to the Jim Crow and police brutalization we are currently facing."

QuotesPorn,3cjydq,yrogerg123,2,Wed Jul 8 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"Dont know who he is and havent read his work. My understanding is that violence is the natural reaction of disagreement. For example, religion. It's a reality that we dont know if there is a god and, if there is one, which is the real god. By accepting the reality that we lack knowledge over a superior being, and thus accepting the possibility of erring on our beliefs, then we can create a space for tolerance of other beliefs. Another example is drugs. A lot of violent crimes are related to the underground drug market. The reality is drugs exist and some people like different drugs for many reasons. Its also a reality that we should be free to create our own philosophy on morality and choose whats good and whats bad. Accepting this reality would mean drugs should be legal and people should be free to make their own decisions and the violence related to the drug war would dissipate.   First post ever.

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,twixonurface,63,Tue Jul 7 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think many people would argue about their right ""not to be offended"". This is often the argument made when someone expresses their unhappiness about something that's caused them offence.  The response would be ""you don't have a right to say whatever you want to people without them responding negatively"".  If you make a joke that's close to the line or way beyond it, people are going to get upset and call you a dick. That doesn't mean that they feel they have a right to avoid offense. It just means they're expressing their dislike of your comment.  It seems to me that many people who like to make offensive comments are the type to poke someone in the eye and then cry when they get hit in return. If you want to build a career or a personality that centres around saying things that are inflammatory,  you need a thick enough skin to deal with the flak you will get in return, as opposed to crying about it being ""only a joke"". We are all socialised and know where the line is. That's why it's exciting to cross it. But there are social consequences to that."

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,blackgold161,12,Wed Jul 8 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"No honestly I don't agree. I think the point is people getting offended and wanting to censure content. That is the problem. Offense is subjective, something that offends me may not offend you or vice verse. That's fine until you start policing what other content people can enjoy. That's what he is talking about. This was definitely taken out of context and to be honest I think a lot of people are missing the point and cultural relevance, especially in this PC age we live in where you or I are told we can't do things because people would get offended. Where governments are making laws telling us what content we can or cannot produce or consume, like the porn filter in the UK or the ban on the production of certain types of pornography in the UK because they are offensive. This is the problem, not that people are told they are assholes, it's that people are told they can't do things that they enjoy because some people get offended"
QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,caboose309,2,Wed Jul 8 07:19:06 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but I believe we, as consumers of comedy, have a right to respond in someway to something we (as individuals or as a group) find offensive other than just walking away. I love comedy and I cherish it, and that love means I want to cultivate its positives and (as best as possible) reduce its negatives."
QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,hansflyingv,2,Wed Jul 8 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"And I totally agree, the point that I got out of it was that he was talking more about censorship of content rather then just simple offense. We don't have the proper context for the quote but it's more then a safe bet because usually when a comedian talks about offending people and people needing to learn to deal with it, they are talking about what happens when a society is too afraid to offend, when a society actively censors content to keep people from being offended. I mean when you have stuff like the banning of production of certain types of pornography in the UK, simply because the Gov't tells you it's immoral, that's a problem. I mean even Chris Rock said he wouldn't do comedy at college campuses anymore because they are too PC. Think about that for a second, a great and extremely funny black comedian won't go to colleges because they get offended too easily and would react wayyyyy to negatively. Colleges are supposed to be higher education, a place to challenge your mind, your way of thinking, and your actions. When college campuses are too PC for comedy like Chris Rocks, while vulgar can be somewhat thought provoking style of comedy then we have a problem."

That is usually the point when someone is insulting you, they want to offend you.  Dumb quote.

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,ITRAINEDYOURMONKEY,3,Wed Jul 8 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, what this quote is driving at is one's ability to shrug off what would usually be offensive.

You are wrong, or so minutely wrong as to make no functional difference.  Theoretically, the being with perfect willpower can shrug off any insults, broaden their mind to infinite ideas, scope out all the options for every decision they make with objectivity and insight, dedicate themselves to hitting the gym and building perfect abs while studying double time after three jobs to earn a triple PHD from MIT and Harvard but we assume that the assholes with perfect precision self-control and endless reserves of energy, attention, and confidence don't still have time after all that to go around on the internet finding everyone on the internet with problems and telling them to just willpower through it."

You don't need to be a ""being with perfect willpower"" to do that.  There are no doubt things you can and probably should be concerned about. And there's no doubt that all of us -not being ""beings with perfect willpower""- have gotten overly concerned or offended over minor things.   None of us are perfect, after all.

But if this is a slip of the tongue, going after him for it is pointless, dishonest, and lacking in basic human empathy.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't believe people always speak literally, so I don't believe we should always take them literally. It's counterproductive."

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,Hehlol,2,Wed Jul 8 13:03:33 2015 UTC,"""Once Gautam Buddha was travelling from a village. Everyone was happy to see him and heard his speeches with lots of dedication. However, one young man was not at all happy to see him in the village. He believed Buddha to be a fake master fooling the masses.  While Buddha was delivering his speech, the man stood and started shouting in a very rude manner. Buddha did not pay any attention to him and continued speaking without bothering about him. This made the young man more angry. He came in front of Buddha and facing him, he began insulting, ""You have no right to teach anything to others. You are as stupid as everyone else. Stop fooling everyone. You are fake.!!""  The followers of Buddha tried to overpower that man. But Buddha stopped them and said, ""It is not always necessary to counter aggression by aggression."" Then he turned to the young man with a smile and asked, ""Tell me, if you buy a gift for someone, and that person does not take it, to whom does the gift belong?""  The young man was surprised to be asked such a strange question and answered, ""It would belong to me, because I bought the gift.""  The Buddha smiled and said, ""That is correct. And it is exactly the same with your anger. If you become angry with me and I do not feel insulted, then the anger falls back on you. You are then the only one who becomes unhappy, not me. All you have done is hurt yourself.""  The man understood the message and he felt embarrassed. Buddha said, ""No matter what the situations are, if you surrender yourself to anger; the anger will always take your life away from you."" The man became the disciple of Buddha."""

I wouldn't want to be him and have to look myself in the mirror every morning, knowing that I have to be an even bigger douche bag today than I was yesterday so I can keep getting paid.  He's no different than the shock jock who needs to continually sink to new levels in order to keep his fans happy and maintain his reputation.

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,FountainsOfFluids,-8,Wed Jul 8 03:58:14 2015 UTC,"Really, you are honestly saying that the sentiment would be more powerful if it came from someone who wasn't white. The same words from a different mouth somehow become more moving just because of the color of his skin changed. If that isn't the definition of racism I don't know what is. Oh and guess what, white people were oppressed all throughout history and just take a look at how South Africa is today. Seriously just stop because the color of your skin today doesn't define wether you are oppressed or if you suffer, it's how much money you have. Class is the only thing that truly separates people, end of story. Take your racism back to tumblr"

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,losesomeweight,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:37:11 2015 UTC,"No I'm not joking, simply saying that he is white therefor he simply isn't as oppressed or is just better off then most simply because of the color of his skin completely ignores his entire history and existence simply because of the color of his skin. You also have to remember that he is British and therefor doesn't have the same racial dynamics as there are in America. If you truly believe that your race matters more in how well off you are in life then money then in sorry but you are completely blind. Money is anything and everything and without it, no matter your race you are fucked. People claim that today it's the powers at be or the gov't that is still oppressing black people and guess what they aren't. They are oppressing the impoverished. The whole system is set up to keep the poor, poor and the rich, rich. Yes do in general black people start out with less, sure. But you can't erase the past and by simply silencing others or stating that their opinions have less weight because of their skin color is simply detrimental. It only creates boundaries and divides us. How do you fix these problems? Honestly I don't know, but I do know that judging someone by their skin color or lessening what they say because of their skin color is not helping.   And besides all that the quote had zero to do with oppression or race, it was simply about getting offended. Let's not forget that everyone gets offended from time to time and it's a subjective thing, something that offends me won't offend you or vice versa. Honestly I just feel like he injected a racial argument into something that was unrelated."

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,recreational,3,Wed Jul 8 17:18:17 2015 UTC,Also I just wanted to add that while he may not experience those things on a day to day level it's possible he came from a very poor family and you don't seem to understand that things are different in the UK then they are in America. There is a lot less racial tension and in the UK blacks and whites are on a more even playing field. You also don't seem to understand what fundamentally makes us human and separates us from animals. It's our ability to truly empathize with other people. To see their suffering and in a way understand it. You are talking in very American centric terms and don't seem to understand the racial situations outside of your own country.

QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,danielvutran,-7,Wed Jul 8 04:13:28 2015 UTC,Im gonna stop coming to the comments of this sub. Everybody is just looking for any way to shit on quote. This is a man who is trying to be heard. Nobody will sit there and listen to you make an airtight statement with all the clauses and loopholes covered. That's why we hire lawyers to read legal documents for us. This a generalized statement that a thinking person would take into their everyday life and apply where applicable.
QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,-Poe-,5,Wed Jul 8 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"But this is quotesporn. The quotes here should be works of art, said succinctly and excellently in such a way that there are no loopholes."
QuotesPorn,3cgq7r,TheSeldomShaken,2,Wed Jul 8 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"in such a way that there are no loopholes.   If that were the case, there'd be maybe 5 quotes on this sub and it'd be dead.  There simply isn't a way to really make any kind of statement without there being some kind of loophole in the logic. People make statements based on their experiences and life. We don't all have the same experiences so not all quotes apply to everyone or every situation. It's simply impossible so context is very important. It's up to you to empathize with the speaker's experiences. One way people on this sub love to tear quotes apart is to remove them from their context.  For instance this a comedian who's telling people to chose not to be offended. Now he is a comedian. Comedians often say things in jest that people take seriously and chose to be offended by. Now regardless of if the comedian really believes the message of the joke, it's primary function is not to offend, it's to be a joke. It's silly. It's fun. The only way it hurts you is if you let it. If it for example the joke offends your religion or political beliefs then you give it credibility by being offended because it shows you're scared of the implication but if you just enjoy the silliness for what it is then it's just silly.  Yes there are times when it's absolutely right to be offended and this quote wouldn't apply or maybe it does apply everywhere. Maybe he's not telling you not to be offended but to be more choosy with what offends you. If someone is blatantly insulting you  with the express intent of offending you then maybe it is right to be offended. If there is a true injustice occurring. However if a comedian made a joke about your race or gender then maybe you should ask yourself, is it really worth getting angry over something trying to be silly? Is this glorified clown really the evil that's tearing me down? Or am I just a whiny prat?"

QuotesPorn,3cf6vi,AdriftSpaceman,10,Tue Jul 7 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"Richard Feynman is probably my favorite human ever... I think this is the original quote that this is derived from:   ""I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts."""

QuotesPorn,3cdlx5,illStudyTomorrow,5,Sat Jul 11 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"There's nothing quite like a scientist speaking out of complete ignorance of history and theology :) His expertise is NOT in the humanities. Someone with a bachelor's degree in history or a degree in philosophy would know more than him. Tyson's expertise is in science, which is an entirely different realm. Don't rely on him in matters of history and theology; that's just as bad as relying on a historian or a theologian in matters of science.   The phrase ""God of the Gaps"" was coined by a theist in the 19th century, as a criticism of those who were believing in God for what they saw as illogical and illegitimate reasons. So to pretend that it is applicable to all theists, when the very origin of the phrase was in an argument by theists against bad theology, is simply ignorant.  Arguments against the God of the Gaps have been around since the 4th century. You can find remnants of it in the writings of Saint Augustine: ""It not infrequently happens that something about the earth, about the sky, about other elements of this world, about the motion and rotation or even the magnitude and distances of the stars, about definite eclipses of the sun and moon, about the passage of years and seasons, about the nature of animals, of fruits, of stones, and of other such things, may be known with the greatest certainty by reasoning or by experience, even by one who is not a Christian. It is too disgraceful and ruinous, though, and greatly to be avoided, that he [the non-Christian] should hear a Christian speaking so idiotically on these matters, and as if in accord with Christian writings, that he might say that he could scarcely keep from laughing when he saw how totally in error they are. [...] With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures"""

QuotesPorn,3c421d,i_will_cut_jew,298,Sat Jul 4 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"This is not a quote made by Pao. From OP's source::   But Ms. Pao says that the most virulent detractors on the site are a vocal minority, and that the vast majority of Reddit users are uninterested in what unfolded over the past 48 hours.   OP should have attributed that quote to the NYTimes like this:   ""But Ms. Pao says that the most virulent detractors on the site are a vocal minority, and that the vast majority of Reddit users are uninterested in what unfolded over the past 48 hours."" --NYTimes, July 3, 2015   Or OP could have used this actual quote (same article, following paragraph from above):   “Most of the community is made up of thoughtful people, and they can appreciate what we all do, even if we don’t always agree.” -Ellen Pao   See the difference? The first paragraph that OP attributed to Pao is actually a quote from the NYTimes article that paraphrases what could have been (for all we know) a lengthy conversation between the reporter and Ms. Pao. The following paragraph is an actual quote from Pao. There is a huge difference.  tl;dr: I know everyone hates her, but /r/quotesporn is better than pretending a quote is real when it's not."

Even in the paraphrased part of the article, from which you decided to incorrectly attribute to Ms. Pao, she never suggests ""We are the minority"". Heck, even in your picture your false-quote doesn't include your ""snippet"" from the title of your post!  Look: your post makes no sense and it violates the subreddit rules. You should do the right thing and remove it yourself. Unless, of course, you're waiting to add to this nonsense by waiting for the mods to do it for you and then claim that Evil Ellen Pao must be behind its removal. I hope you're better than that.  Do the right thing, OP. Admit you messed up and delete the post. Find a real quote next time and as others have pointed out? White text, black-border. Makes it easier to read.  tl;dr: ""This is how rumors of incorrect quotes on the internet originate and it does a disservice to our great Union."" --Abraham Lincoln, 1864"

Usually, we would assume the reporter paraphrase whatever Pao said into the ""quote"" you provided. Since it's a paraphrase it's not, well, a quote?! At least that's how I usually view it. (The thing is, while NYT is generally trustworthy and we can maybe assume that Pao did really intend to disregard this Victoria issue as a minor dispute, if your ""quote"" has come from a less reputable source, it might be some shitty tabloid twist sensationalization to fuck with our legit concerns.)

QuotesPorn,3bw994,JFSOCC,18,Thu Jul 2 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"My favorite phrase in science is ""Turns out we were wrong.""   I honestly mean that positively. I love that real science accepts new evidence, and the only thing that slows that down is not the ideology, but the fact that scientists are still human and sometimes resist change. But over the long term, and occasionally very suddenly, science can shift an opinion on a major topic due to new evidence or the realization that old evidence was obtained poorly.  And when scientists announce that a previous theory was wrong, that means we've learned something important about the world we live in."
QuotesPorn,3bw994,FountainsOfFluids,9,Fri Jul 3 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"This response is spot on. During my research I've had multiple instances where my initial expectations were proven wrong by the data. I never look at this as a bad thing because my goal isn't to prove I'm right, its to understand whats happening. This perfectly sums up the beauty of science. In a world composed of shades of gray, empirical data is black and white."

QuotesPorn,3bw994,concretepigeon,50,Fri Jul 3 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"I think most kids start out that way with everything. They see something different and think ""that's funny"". Why's it do this?   Then they stick it in their mouths or somewhere else to figure out the new things.  The grow up, gradually learning more and more about how things work. They no longer need to test gravity to know that things fall if dropped. Unfortunately, for most people, they start dropping the initial curiosity. They start ignoring the oddities. The unexpected becomes undesirable. They decide to surround themselves in the predictable and delete anything else.  That's the saddest moment of a child's life. The moment when ""That's funny"" gets replaced with ""That's wrong, it works this way because of XYZ"".   Sadly, a non-small part of education encourages the wrong thinking. The dogmatic mind, where you know all the answers and just have to make the data fit is much easier to grade. It's easier to test. Curiosity it destroyed. Some call it growing up and the real world. Bleck. If that's the real world, you can keep it!  Stay curious!"

Even the simple choice of choosing to read a liberal or republican newspaper you'll see a shift in views and opinions, all of which converge to give you a different spin on events than what happened.   Thats not to say we haven't improved greatly over the past. Information is easier to get nowadays and more available to people. Its definitely harder to coverup something massive than in the past.

QuotesPorn,3bvzb7,viaconqueso,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"Foolish quote.   I agree with Archenon in his statement but I would also like to take it a step further.  ""History"" as it stands is always created rather then a matter of Fact.   Depending upon who is recording it, will greatly depend upon how it is written; or in today's world, reported.   So when studying history, it is always best to read multiple sources and do your research before making a judgement.   And even then you should always keep an open mind, new information may always appear.  But this statement is not talking about ""history"".    It is talking about popular opinion.   It is referring to the youth passing judgement on issues with out having good information, or even bothering to understand the issue. In most cases the information used, has already been twisted, manipulated and modified to meet the agenda of who ever is reporting it.   Access to information DOES not give you the ability to understand it.   The trick is to take information, expand upon it, read more about it, study it, research it and then use logic and reason to reach a possible conclusion.   If you can not do that then in the end you will believe the first thing you are told, read or see and fall into the rank in file of what ever agenda is behind the decision that has been made for you."

Though it is supposed to encourage you to keep trying and not give up, it's been a bit of a counter-productive motto to me insofar as it's made me okay with the lack of results. I'm trying and trying and feeling not comfortable with ""failure"" (or lack of recognition) but accustomed to it.   And then on the other end of the spectrum you have people like Bo Burnham, Charlie Puth and Madeon who rose to fame quite quickly, through a combination of talent, timing and luck. When I look at them, I tend to send that above-mentioned motto straight to hell  and think that I need to go harder better faster stronger!"

The quote doesn't ""make"" you ok with a lack of results...that's your perspective on it. I point this out because I've found through experience that it's necessary to change our perspective on how we view circumstances before things seem to start ""going our way.""  And, what's a lack of results? Have you been trying and just not found what works yet? Or have you been not trying and are now lamenting about it? There is a huge difference between the two.  If you've been trying but haven't found what works yet, that's not a waste of time or something to get down on yourself about.

QuotesPorn,3bkb11,nuocmam,3,Tue Jun 30 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I didn't know that it's a common one among the sects. Your comment made me rethink about OP's quote, ""Never let your sense of morals..."" Morals, such as ""good samaritan"", are taught by religion.  If morals can prevent religious people from doing what right then is it then not better to not have religion/be religious?  I'm not debating.  Just thinking out loud. I do know that some people do need religion."
QuotesPorn,3bkb11,BeanzPatio,3,Tue Jun 30 03:56:47 2015 UTC,"Morals are guidelines on how to act rightly or appropriately, and they are not exclusive to religion. Every person is taught morality by those around them, although perhaps not explicitly. As a result, a non-religious person may also be prevented from doing the wrong thing because of their morals.   When people do the wrong thing 'because of their morals', it probably means one of several things: (1) they are more worried about them putting up the appearance of being moral rather than actually being moral; (2) they do not fully understanding the morals they have been taught, and how to apply those morals in certain situations; or (3) they may be too afraid to perform those moral actions due to circumstances outside their control.  To reiterate, this is not exclusive to religious people. All people have morals and may fail to enact them. I would argue that a belief in God and reason go hand-in-hand when it comes to morality. If you just believe in God you will no doubt fail to see the shades of grey; but if you just use reason you will break under difficult circumstance and give yourself ""rational"" justifications for your failings; belief and reason together will allow you to see the shades of grey, but give you the courage to do what's right even when it's at your own expense."

An agnostic on the other hand believes there's no real evidence either way and chooses to not make a decision on the matter.  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic  So explain to me how you can be both, and don't use any definitions you've made up about the two.   It's like if we are looking at a jar of gumballs and you say there is an even amount of gumballs in that jar. I would say I don't believe you. That doesn't mean I'm saying there is an odd number. It's just that I dismiss your claim.   Sure, but an agnostic would say I don't know one way or the other so I don't believe or disbelieve you.  Edit - Wait I reread your example. So if you don't believe that there is an even number of gumballs in the jar you are without a doubt saying there is an odd amount of gumballs in the jar."
QuotesPorn,3beju9,Bukojuko,11,Sun Jun 28 19:54:08 2015 UTC,Belief is different than knowledge. You seem to think that when an atheist says they don't believe in God that they  are making a positive claim that God doesn't exist.   Edit: athiesm and theism is about belief. Agnostic and gnostic are about knowledge and what we can know. An agnostic would say it is impossible to know. An agnostic athiest would say its impossible to know and they choose not to believe.
QuotesPorn,3beju9,thepowerisyours,-4,Sun Jun 28 19:57:07 2015 UTC,"An agnostic athiest would say its impossible to know but they choose not to believe.   That's honestly the dumbest thing I've ever read. What are you going to tell me you have hard evidence that god does not exist? No? Then the first statement is irrelevant, it applies to everything. Theists, atheists, agnostic, everyone knows it's impossible to know 100% certain whether god exists, but it's what they choose to believe that defines them and separates them. Theists choose to believe, atheists choose not to believe, agnostics choose to not take a stance."
QuotesPorn,3beju9,Bukojuko,4,Sun Jun 28 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"So what's a gnostic do?  You seem to think that agnosticism is the in between of athiesm and theism, which is just not true. Agnosticism and gnosticism are different sides of the same coin. Atheism and theism are different sides of the same coin. And those 2 coins are totally different"
QuotesPorn,3beju9,thepowerisyours,-7,Sun Jun 28 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Come on now. We all know there is no hard evidence either way, but some choose to take their current knowledge and make a stance one way or the other, others choose to take their current knowledge and say it's not enough for me to form an opinion on the matter. That is the difference between the two, and it is a distinct difference.  Claiming atheism is in the realm as agnosticism is like claming christianity is as well."

QuotesPorn,3beju9,VeeganZombie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"What is ironic about it? There are plenty of rational philosophical arguments for the existence of god. I might agree with you that I think the arguments against the existence of god outweigh opposing arguments, but I'm not going to pretend they don't exist or pretend that believing in god is inherently irrational.  Some people believe that the universe and all its infinite complexities couldn't possibly exist without some sort of creator. Simple as that.

This quote is among his most famous (""God is dead"" is another popular one) and due to its popularity, it has become a bit of a cliche. I decided to post it here after I saw this comment by /u/hegartymorgan in /r/quotes. I am unfamiliar with this translation as I've only read Kaufmann's translation of Beyond Good and Evil, but it is nevertheless a beautiful rendering of this well-known quote.  Also, the photo I've used is one of the Eiger mountain in the Bernese Alps. Nietzsche spent much of his life in Switzerland, which is why I chose this photograph in particular."

This results in the ""crippling of individuals"" and the erosion of human creativity.

I explained my position in response to another individual who subscribed to the 10,000 hour mantra.   Edit: damn you, autocorrect! Paw to pas  The TL;DR is thus: 10,000 is a heavy approximation with numerous outliers (perhaps Gladwell actually intended this interpretation based upon the title of his book) and those hours only ""count"" within a very specific and narrow definition. Thus, the comic's estimation of 7 years is being overly optimistic if not predatory. But, perhaps that was the intended message? It'd be an interesting question to pass along the author."

I was arguing against the idea that you can become a master at multiple disciplines. It's a fairly straight forward argument.   People like to buy into that idea through subscription to Gladwells popularized idea of mastery. It's been grossly misinterpreted and people should recognize that.   And, I'd argue that there are clear distinctions between what constitutes an expert and 'someone who is good enough to teach'. If you want to go by the 'hours' model, there's an approximate 12,000 hour dofference between those who teach and those who are experts, with respect to classical music.

These are called Renaissance Men, or polymaths; they're so actually real, there's a word for them.

Lastly, I put on my armchair psychologist hat and attacked your persona, saying it's ""overly pessimistic"" and how you've created your own limits.

QuotesPorn,3b7pxx,remyg6,2,Sat Jun 27 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes! The Malcom Gladwell 10,000 hour figure! I figured that's what you were referring to. The 11 year mark threw me off, however.  Yes, you are indeed, correct. It does take, approximately, 10 whole years to become an expert in a field.   And, yes, of course, your math checks out.   But, what Gladwell or the fabled 10,000-hour marker does not tell you is that those 10,000 hours are more of an approximation. Because, you see, the psychologists that actually found this number calculated that figure based upon averages. Some activities take upwards of 25-30 years of dedication! Others, like digit memorization... 500 hours! The devil is in the details!   And, of course, the formulation of that figure never took into account ""exploration time"". Instead, it has to be deliberate, dedicated time spent focusing on improvement. So, that translates to: the only hours that ""count"" towards your fabled 10,000 figure are those hours in which you are actually improving! I know, it sucks :(  So, I hope you can begin to see the flaw in your reasoning. It takes an enormous amount of time to become great. It takes an even larger amount of time to become an expert. You begin to compound the actual ""hours"" needed to achieve this with the decline in neural plasticity of aging adults and the probability of becoming a multi-expert begins to shrink...and shrink...and shrink.     I could dip into Calvinism and show you why this 10,000 hour figure fits so perfectly with our Western ideals but that's currently out of the scope of this discussion.    So, yes, of course, you can become an expert in any field given that you have 10 years worth of time (and money!) to devote to said task. But... in all likelihood, it's more like 30 years because you need to factor in practice time, exploration time, and ""perfect"" time. And, it's also dependent upon your own personal equipment, your life's trajectory, available resources, etc.   I do very much wish it was possible to become an expert in multiple disciplines but the lack of remarkable individuals currently paints a rather grim picture, I'm afraid."

All it seems to be saying is the whole ""luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"" idea. I mean my dream job is programming remotely so I can travel freely and not have to commute. If I meet someone tomorrow who is desperately looking to hire someone for a position like that, I unfortunately just won't have the skill set required yet. I will be unprepared and unqualified for the opportunity. So I work toward that so I'll be ready when it comes along."
QuotesPorn,3b7pxx,partybanana,5,Fri Jun 26 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"I like the quote you referred to, but my point is that this one goes further in a significant way. Your quote is similar to the Jefferson quote:  ""I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.""  Churchill's quote takes that a step further and says there will be a unique moment in everyone's life where they are destined to do ""a very special thing"" during their ""finest hour"". Churchill was a man desperate to do great things his entire life probably due to insecurity about things from his childhood - sound familiar? I don't think encouraging that kind of glorious view of ourselves is healthy, but I do think trying to encourage people to accomplish meaningful things in their own lives is a good thing.  Every time people start talking about ""changing the world"", it makes me think of that great line from Hayek:  ""The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."""

QuotesPorn,3b8qtb,Mysterious_Drifter,4,Fri Jun 26 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"From his 1946 philosophical work, Existentialism is a Humanism. Full book here online.  Context of the quote:   Quietism is the attitude of people who say, “let others do what I cannot do.” The doctrine I am presenting before you is precisely the opposite of this, since it declares that there is no reality except in action. It goes further, indeed, and adds, “Man is nothing else but what he purposes, he exists only in so far as he realises himself, he is therefore nothing else but the sum of his actions, nothing else but what his life is.” Hence we can well understand why some people are horrified by our teaching. For many have but one resource to sustain them in their misery, and that is to think, “Circumstances have been against me, I was worthy to be something much better than I have been. I admit I have never had a great love or a great friendship; but that is because I never met a man or a woman who were worthy of it; if I have not written any very good books, it is because I had not the leisure to do so; or, if I have had no children to whom I could devote myself it is because I did not find the man I could have lived with. So there remains within me a wide range of abilities, inclinations and potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions.” But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art. The genius of Proust is the totality of the works of Proust; the genius of Racine is the series of his tragedies, outside of which there is nothing. Why should we attribute to Racine the capacity to write yet another tragedy when that is precisely what he did not write? In life, a man commits himself, draws his own portrait and there is nothing but that portrait. No doubt this thought may seem comfortless to one who has not made a success of his life. On the other hand, it puts everyone in a position to understand that reality alone is reliable; that dreams, expectations and hopes serve to define a man only as deceptive dreams, abortive hopes, expectations unfulfilled; that is to say, they define him negatively, not positively. Nevertheless, when one says, “You are nothing else but what you live,” it does not imply that an artist is to be judged solely by his works of art, for a thousand other things contribute no less to his definition as a man. What we mean to say is that a man is no other than a series of undertakings, that he is the sum, the organisation, the set of relations that constitute these undertakings.   My apologies in advance for the weird green glow. I meant to make it grey like the rest. I'm also very sorry for making a wall-of-text-quote post on this sub, but this passage really stood out to me while I was reading it last night."
QuotesPorn,3b8qtb,AuthorWannabe,3,Fri Jun 26 21:58:06 2015 UTC,"""Existentialism is a Humanism"" is a wonderful and rather easy to grasp introduction to existentialist thought. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning philosophy on their own."

QuotesPorn,3b32yd,adamrcarmack,41,Thu Jun 25 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"John Muir was a seriously cool person. He was an early advocate of environmental conservation, was buddies with Theodore Roosevelt, was instrumental in the establishment of many national parks, as well as the general preservation of the Alaskan wilderness.  In addition to that, he founded the Sierra Club, and has some of the most moving, provocative nature writing of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.  Check him out, if that's what you're into. He is a neat historical figure."
QuotesPorn,3b32yd,TheGreenAaron,18,Thu Jun 25 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"Very cool, thanks for sharing!   In his later life, Muir devoted most of his time to the preservation of the Western forests. He petitioned the U.S. Congress for the National Park bill that was passed in 1890, establishing Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks   It would be interesting to see how those particular parks would have ended up without his petition for the national park bill.  I thought the passage about his experiencing Yosemite was particularly interesting:   Finally settling in San Francisco, Muir immediately left for a week-long visit to Yosemite, a place he had only read about. Seeing it for the first time, Muir notes that ""He was overwhelmed by the landscape, scrambling down steep cliff faces to get a closer look at the waterfalls, whooping and howling at the vistas, jumping tirelessly from flower to flower.""[11] Theodore Roosevelt about John Muir: ""I was interested and a little surprised to find that, unlike John Burroughs, John Muir cared little for birds or bird songs, and knew little about them. The hermit-thrushes meant nothing to him, the trees and the flowers and the cliffs everything.""[21] He later returned to Yosemite and worked as a shepherd for a season. He climbed a number of mountains, including Cathedral Peak and Mount Dana, and hiked the old Indian trail down Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake.  John Muir was very creative and he designed a water-powered mill to cut wind-felled trees, and he built a small cabin along Yosemite Creek,[22]:207 designing it so that a section of the stream flowed through a corner of the room so he could enjoy the sound of running water. He lived in the cabin for two years,[23]:143 and wrote about this period in his book First Summer in the Sierra (1911). Muir's biographer, Frederick Turner, notes Muir's journal entry upon first visiting the valley and writes that his description ""blazes from the page with the authentic force of a conversion experience."""
QuotesPorn,3b32yd,UncleBenjen,3,Thu Jun 25 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'll add to that by saying you can find a lot of John Muir's works in the public domain, both as ebooks and audiobooks. Librivox.org will have the audiobooks and the sources from which they read."

QuotesPorn,3b32yd,D4FTPUNKF4N,12,Fri Jun 26 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"Story time.       I was friends with a few people who ran the Outdoor Club on our campus in college.  They ran trips off-campus to go hiking, camping, river-rafting, etc.  Whoever had originally founded it had a dozen framed photos of landscapes with John Muir quotes everywhere in their tiny building.  They were in the bathroom, the storage closet... I think there were six in the lobby alone.    For the people running the club, it became a long-running joke to make up ""John Muir"" quotes while out on a club activity. It started out with plausible ones.     ""A river so vast, it touches your very soul to lay eyes upon it.  John Muir, eighteen sixty-two.""    ""Nature is as essential to a man's well-being as shelter or nourishment.  John Muir, nineteen-eleven.""       They always ended it with the name and year.  Usually, new participants in club activities just accepted them at face value.  But as time went on, the quotes got a little more ridiculous.       ""The very next step you take into the great outdoors, take a moment to wonder just how many animals have shit in that exact spot.  John Muir, sixteen twenty-two.""    ""Spend a few hours out in the woods one afternoon, and you will feel every connection to every other being around you.  But make sure you can find your way back when the acid wears off.  John Muir, nineteen seventy-eight.""    ""As I awoke to a chill sunrise over mountain peaks, surrounded by the sounds of the forest awakening, I realized:  Shit happens when you party naked.  John Muir, two-thousand and two."""

Standards of living has improved, social mobility is far greater than ever before, education is far more widespread and more in depth, food is easily accessible, water is clean, so on and so forth. It's really easy to feel pessimistic, and ""ignorance is bliss"" but you have to keep things in perspective, and the perspective is looking far brighter than ever before. Think about how many people have died because of illnesses that most people can't even remember anymore because they're just gone.

Barring the fact that I was wrong and it's not as much of an improvement as I thought, it's still very impressive, especially when you realize that almost all of the forest is in private hands instead of federally protected, meaning that it's extremely likely to continually improve instead of decline.

QuotesPorn,3aziac,brutinator,2,Thu Jun 25 02:16:34 2015 UTC,What happens when you fill a brilliant mind with shitty data?
QuotesPorn,3aziac,JustStrength,6,Thu Jun 25 05:41:45 2015 UTC,"Shitty data's an extremely subjective term. I think knowing how to read is pretty important, so good thing literacy is way up. In the quote itself, it mentions how much corn Iowa grew, which would be pretty important if you're in the agricultural or food industry. What would consider to be garbage information? It's not like people have a information capacity. Amazingly, I both know all the state capitals AND a bit of philosophy and logic. I read a lot of fiction novels and stuff, AND I have a decent grasp on modern events.   On top of which, people have the capability to learn whatever they want, whenever they want. Whether or not people utilize that resource doesn't detract that its available. I don't think it's really fair to judge people on what they know because it doesn't fit your notion on important information.   Wouldn't you consider it to be a positive that even the most white trash person out there can at least read? That's a pretty huge leap forward even from just 50 years ago."
QuotesPorn,3aziac,brutinator,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:53:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoy your response, and I'm primarily playing the role of devil's advocate because contention creates more than apathy.  So let's see.  You use anecdotal evidence regarding your own personal capacity to memorize contestably useful information as well as critical thinking skills and the foundation for them.  This seems slightly in contrast of each other, but that's nit picking, really.  I certainly agree that we cannot predict what kind of information is useful and so on the surface it seems we shouldn't decide what kind of data is useful and what isn't.  However, I will contest that our brains have infinite storage capacity.  I... don't really think I need to explain that in detail so I will just surmise with: time, use, and cognitive decay.  Ergo, it would seem to me that schools teaching people more so how to develop logical, critical thinking skills would be more important than learning facts that one could pull up in a few seconds by saying ""Yo Siri"" or ""Okay, Google.""  I know it's not a black and white and in order to have fundamental critical thinking skills you're required to have some base knowledge of facts.  Not to mention the fact that our brains can soak up information intentionally or not, so it's not like programming a computer.  But that makes it even more important not to teach a kid in Los Angeles about the corn yields in southern Indiana.  There's so much information in the world, why learn that shit?  Let some kid in southern Indiana learn that while the kid in LA learns the local gang colors.  Or whatever.  And yeah, it's great that even the most white trash person out there can read about how terrible black people are and then use that information to go kill a bunch of innocent people.  That's fucking great."
QuotesPorn,3aziac,SilentRevolts,2,Thu Jun 25 06:13:46 2015 UTC,"We haven't been able to find a limit to brain capacity, so instead I'll say, for all intents and purposes, it's practically infinite. You always have the ability to learn and store more information.   So let me ask you this. Do you think more people were taught critical thinking skills 200 years ago than today? 100 years? 50 years?  That's twisting the my point. If someone was going to commit racial violence, they were going to do that whether or not they can read. The fact is, knowledge is a tool. The fact that that tool is far more widespread is a objectively a good thing. Do you think it would be better if people couldn't read? Do you think education leads to more or less violence?   I don't really see what your point is. I'm saying that people are more educated now than ever before, and that educational resources are far more available and attainable. I'm not saying everyone is at the same level, I'm just saying that things are steadily rising up, year after year. Is that wrong?"
QuotesPorn,3aziac,______DEADPOOL______,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delay in response, I had to mix another cocktail.  Dousing my brain in alcohol was the only way I could come up with enough asinine diatribe to contend your valid points.  The sacrifices I make in pursuit of challenging minds...  I don't think people today, in American public schools, are taught problem solving skills.  Given niche environments of the time (we have more diverse knowledge now, that's for sure), I think we have forgotten how to ""make do with what you have.""  Instead, I see so many people ceasing work in search of the best tool instead of getting the job done with what's there.  This is anecdotal, which is anathema to me, so I'll leave it with this instead:  the average person couldn't survive a week alone anymore.  Granted that's not a requirement in today's society, but the ability to solve dynamic problems without prior knowledge still is in every single field that I am aware of.  People (as a generalization - we still have some leaders) rarely solve problems any more - they look up the answer.  I'm bringing up a specific point re: racism/education with the alleged mass killer of South Carolina currently featured in the news.  The individual stated in numerous formations that he was ""enligthened"" by the facts he read regarding black on white crime, and was disgusted that no one was doing anything about what the information he read told him was an epidemic.  I think that's a pretty good example of education being dangerous if it's the wrong kind of data being disseminated (which I alluded to earlier in the thread).  I certainly don't think it'd be better if people couldn't read, but the world isn't black and white (u c wut I did tharr??!).  You're certainly right in that people are more literate, but literacy itself does not equal progressive advancement.  You can teach people stupid things, too.  I'll avoid pulling a Godwin for now, I'm not that saturated in blessed fermentation.  Yet.  You are right that more people are educated than ever before, and that there is certainly far, far more educational resources available and attainable (huge shout out to Khan Academy and Wikipedia, in no order of favoritism).  But my challenge to you is that education itself is not always benign.  It can be used for malificence and we should proceed without extolling the virtues of a highly influential conglomerate of organizations when the efficacy of their preferred methodology of education is counter-productive towards the enlightenment of our species.  So you're right.  But educating a shit ton of factory assembly workers isn't exactly going to bring in the dawn of a new golden era.  Sir Ken Robinson touches on this a bit in his TED talk, as do many others in various books, blogs, and sidewalk chalk.  Is he accurate?  Iunno.  But a lot of people believe it, so either way, it's evidence that education is not always based around empirical, objective data.  Edit:  Shit, sorry.  Catching up on YouTube subscriptions and just started some more Jon Oliver.  Standardized Testing.  I could have summarized my whole post with this."
QuotesPorn,3aziac,StupidSolipsist,2,Thu Jun 25 07:06:17 2015 UTC,"Of course it isn't perfect, and that people are going to do different things with it. However, I think that the more educated people are out there, the better the world gets. Every industry is practically bursting with brilliant minds, from the medical fields to STEM fields, and the rate of progress that we've been experiencing is, in my opinion, almost 100% to do with how many educated people are out there pushing the boundaries.   The fact is, if someone is going to go on a killing spree because of something they read, then they would have gone on a killing spree anyways. It doesn't matter the reason, if they read it or heard it, these kind of people will latch onto any belief with maniacal fervor. It's a mental illness, not education, that causes it.   Many, many people are extremely good at ""making do with what they have"". In the construction field, you see some amazing ""Redneck solutions"" from time to time. However, it's just as important to have the right tool for the job. It's far easier and efficient to take 20 minutes to pick up a tile scraper to pull up tile than to take the pry bar you have on hand.   I'd argue that people have never been well adapted to surviving alone. Sure, there's people who lived in the frontier by themselves, but by and large, people haven't lived alone in forever. People are pack animals, that's what we do best. However, you think that most people living in 1700's England could live on their own any better than we could?   I think too that we may have different ideas on what's ""intelligent"", which is a debate going on since the dawn of man. Is knowing a lot of information smart? Is having ""common sense"" smart? Is being able to learn quickly smart? And so on. Me personally, I think its smarter to find the right tool than to spend forever trying to do a task inadequately. If I'm trying to catalog my music, for example, I'm not going to go through each song, one by one. I'm gonna find a program that was designed with my needs in mind so it won't take me years to do.   I'd point out that the very fact that he pointed out that every country on Earth is adjusting its educational system to work best is more proof to my point. Everything is steadily being refined. So we're better than those 20 years ago. And those 20 years from now are going to be better than us. It's a pretty recent development where teachers are using a multitude of different styles to get through to their students. For example, in my history class in high school, we were almost never tasked with memorizing dates. Instead, we focused on the causes of certain events, what happened, and what was the result, and when we were tested, a large portion of the test had to do with explaining why we thought something happened, or whether the result was a positive or negative outcome, why it went that way, and so on. You know, critical thinking questions. Same for in English and so on. We probably spent just as much time analyzing the context of the book  as reading the book itself, because it's important to know why Mark Twain felt like he needed to write Huck Finn. It's important to know what was going on at the time, because that was a pretty significant historical time for the United States. Even in math we weren't tasked with memorizing formulas, but by learning why the formulas worked, and how to break down a problem. A lot of the issues people espouse about the educational system are definitely going away. I went to a public school in Nevada, the second worst state in the nation education wise, and most of my classes put more emphasis on breaking something down than memorizing a fact. Obviously its anecdotal, but it shows that things are getting better.   And my last point is, the fact that we can even have this talk is pretty incredible. My family comes from a line of farmers and so on, not exactly of ""elite"" society, and there's no way that I could have a conversation like this 50 years ago. I think, unequivocally, education's benefits far, far, far outweigh the negatives. Can it improve? Of course. Everything can. But it's never been this good before."

QuotesPorn,3aziac,realigion,33,Wed Jun 24 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"We could have the opposite of that.  In god damn third grade I wasn't allowed to go to the root beer float party because I didn't ""know my times tables.""   Well fuck them. I have a fairly complete computer science background from a very rigorous program, can do math up to differential equations fairly easily, and still don't know my multiplication tables. Jerks.  But on a serious note, what's sad about this is I went my entire life thinking I was bad at math and ended up hating it. Now it's well known that early success is the heaviest factor in later mastery of a subject. I felt that effect first hand: because I was ""bad"" at math and ""good"" at literature/social science/history, I chose not to take math my junior and senior year of high school.  You can imagine the setback when I rolled into an engineering school where 2/3rds of the student body had already taken calc 2 courses in high school and I hadn't even taken pre-calc.  In the real world, yes we kind of have that. In education though, we're really fucking ourselves by not getting past this point."

QuotesPorn,3aziac,realigion,3,Thu Jun 25 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"At this point you must be able to multiply numbers up to 12, though. I was slower at that too as a kid so I understand that feeling of discouragement but when I'm multiply numbers in my head now I use a system of patterning based on seeing over and over again what x * y was equal to. I don't necessarily need to do this with not just a calculator but Wolfram Alpha in my pocket, but I think having that early pattern recognition training is a decent segue into algebra. The problem is that people who don't really care about math are teaching it because public school teaching isn't incentivized nearly enough, and so they stick to by-the-book or by-the-state/federal-standard-test teaching, and too often that takes the form of ""teach every kid times tables up to 12 in 4th grade"" rather than ""every gradate of 4th grade should be able to tell me what x * y is equal to for naturals x and y less than 12"". Regardless I'm sorry you had that experience. Any school system that lets kids drop out of math clearly isn't investing close to enough in them."

If you're in college, there is no way you don't know what 7 times 6 is. You have to memorize some stuff to an extent. That is not to say you memorize it without understanding. For example, you need to know what seven times six actually means. You're adding seven to seven, six times. But if you memorize this kinda stuff, your calculation is way faster.   I'm all for understanding concepts but at some point you internalize a lot of stuff, like multiplication tables, which is essentially memorization."

I disagree that you have to ""know"" it.  It takes me less than a second to calculate, it takes someone else less than a second to remember it. But how much time of their life did they waste (especially in early math education) trying to memorize it when they could've been learning more important abstraction skills?  More importantly, my approach is scalable. I can calculate 7 * 45 (7 * 10 * 4 + 35) in the same way as I do 7 * 6, but if you only memorized it, you're SOL trying to apply your 12*12 grid.   You're right that over time I have memorized more and more as life goes on, but this is a consequence of understanding. This is the only way it makes sense to memorize something: understand it until you can use it, use it until you can remember it."

A lot of people did the same but either still see no employment or are overwhelmed by debt.  My generation is probably the most educated ever compared to the generations in the past. Most people want to work. All of my friends have ambitions and dreams. The fucked up thing is getting past all the shit that earlier generations have left us with. It's not the people, it's the system cause we sure as shit didn't have a perfect world to work with when we were born. The worst part about this quote is the fact that someone from an older generation would accuse us of having no guidance. Seriously? What kind of blamegame bullshit is that? Wouldn't it be his generation guiding us?"
QuotesPorn,3auft5,dv282828,77,Tue Jun 23 17:43:34 2015 UTC,"By poorly educated I believe he means educated in an unmarketable field and other base skills needed to function in society (how many colleges/schools teach debt/taxes/mortgages/etc?). This is also likely referencing the high debt to return ratio that a lot of kids get into going into college - because high school / parents / society has poorly educated them on what the risk / reward for their degrees are.  By no skill, he likely means no work based skills. Remember, this guy made his living highlighting labor jobs.   The rest is likely the expectation of what a job is - he is likely referencing the notion that this generation has been raised to be more than labor but there is in reality nothing wrong with that (wages aside, that is another topic).  ""Go to college, you don't want to be a factory worker"" is the epitome of what he (imo) is talking about."

QuotesPorn,3auft5,SunMoonTruth,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:21:52 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't even have to be a credit class. Most community colleges do adult life learning classes that are even cheaper than a 3-credit course.  It seems like the majority of people putting down higher education are the people that went straight into a four-year university and didn't realize there are far better alternatives. Much like how Mike Rowe notices how people talk down blue collar jobs, the same people talk down community colleges and ensure the path of higher education has a debt toe tag attached to it.  Community colleges take up the two-year A.S. degrees that specifically lead to workforce blue collar jobs. Heck, some states have even managed to convince their state legislature to open up four-year degrees at community colleges. Universities absolutely hate it because a 4-year degree at a community college is still a fraction of the cost of what it is at a university.  Mike Rowe has a point about the loss of vocational classes in high school, but there are plenty of community colleges and technical schools out there that accomplish exactly what he's griping about."

QuotesPorn,3auft5,Narrative_Causality,17,Tue Jun 23 22:58:07 2015 UTC,"a bit more context then 25 random words:  https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/1012057572137719:0   Let me be clear - I stand by everything I said in my original post. The lack of work ethic in America is a serious problem, and it’s getting worse everyday. But obviously, that doesn’t mean every parent is a failure, or every teacher is a hack. Nor does it mean every kid is slacker, or every person out of work is lazy. However, there’s no getting around the fact that we - the collective we - are no longer instilling the belief that mastering a skill and working hard can lead to a prosperous life. Consequently, millions of able-bodied people have concluded the system is rigged, and stopped looking for work. This is, in my opinion, is the greatest threat our country faces.   Let me riff on the Tea Party quote for a second. Many are asking me to explain exactly how we are we “churning out” the people in question. Personally, I think it started when we began pushing a four-year degree at the expense of every other form of learning. Back when we started describing education as “higher,” vs. “alternative.” Back when we started embracing goofy platitudes like “Work Smart, Not Hard.” Traditional portrayals of hard work have been slowly devolving into stereotypes ever since. On TV, plumbers were 300 pounds with giant butt-cracks. Every other skilled worker looked like Schneider from One Day at a Time. Books like “The 4-Hour Work Week” became instant best-sellers, American Idol became the #1 show in the country, and Madison Avenue found endless way to remind us that true contentment required less work and more vacation. Hard work, delayed gratification, and many other virtues once acknowledged as keys to success were gradually repositioned as impediments to happiness.  Over time, people got the message. Enthusiasm for the skilled trades began to wane. Vocational education vanished from high school. The definition of a “good job” began to change, and before long, everyone was getting a trophy, or expecting one. Meanwhile, demand kept increasing for four-year schools, so universities were able to raise tuition at rates that far exceeded inflation. Vast amounts of money were then made available, and students borrowed it like never before.   Today, the results are self-evident. One point two trillion dollars of student loans hang like a millstone from the necks of college graduates. Many are now perfectly educated for jobs that don’t exist, and untrained for those that do. Thus, the people we’re “churning out,” have been told to expect something that isn't there, and trained to see genuine opportunities as vocational consolation prizes. Now, there’s an added obstacle that many employers talk about with real concern - a profound resistance to moving to where the jobs are. Not just a resistance - but a kind of indignation at the mere suggestion. Many people now believe a “good job” is a job that exists in one’s current zip code. This to me, is the most jarring thing. A nation once defined by a pioneer spirit and a willingness to keep moving, now seems stuck in one place.   I know it’s hard to relocate. In some cases, I know it’s nearly impossible. I also know it’s easy for a guy in my position to sound judgmental and out of touch with the problems so many face. But every statistic confirms my point. People are resistant to change. We don’t want to retrain, retool, and relocate. We want a job that meets our expectations. A job that we like. A job that’s convenient. A job that pays what we think we deserve. These expectations are both limiting and unrealistic. But we - the collective we - have allowed them to persist. We reward the precise behavior we should be discouraging. My foundation does not."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,Okichah,222,Wed Jun 24 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. I think the best comment I've seen on the issue is that a milk man was a real job decades ago. You could make a full on living with a house and family delivering milk. That doesn't fly anymore. People need a much more phenomenal skill set to get even part time work. A lot of companies want to avoid giving benefits, so people are limited to less than 40 hours a week of crummy pay.  The amount of new jobs added to our economy over the past couple years has been great, but a vast majority of them are part time. The minimalist movement? That isn't nearly as much about sustainability as I wish it was. People are just giving themselves more realistic expectations. Live within your means because that's the only option at this point.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,FailosoRaptor,19,Tue Jun 23 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"There seems to be an idea that trade jobs are not desired or sought after by the youth.    Trade jobs are, by and large, not sought after by young people. I just got hired as an engineer for a company that makes custom parts for a niche market. The parts are huge, but they need to be machined to extremely tight tolerances (+/- .001"" on parts that are nearly 2 feet in diameter). They might not sit in cubes or be able to do finite element analysis like some of the other engineers do, but those machinists are fucking brilliant and do damned good work. Operating a CNC lathe is fucking hard, and being able to consistently turn parts that are right on the balls and do it fast is even harder. They are all really nice guys who are very skilled in their jobs, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for them.  They are also old. Of the 70 or so machinists at my company, there are probably only 10 that are under the age of 35. Being a CNC machinist in my area (Twin Cities metro) is great because the demand is huge for them (unemployment amongst machinists is near zero), but it seems like only a handful are turned out each year. People need to realize that being blue collar is totally ok and we still need skilled people in those roles! Not only that, but you can actually make really good money doing these jobs, which I don't think a lot of people realize."

QuotesPorn,3auft5,berger77,4,Wed Jun 24 03:50:20 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is to apply for an apprentice-type position at one of these companies. Depending on the size and culture of the company, many places will train you if you are willing to work for less to start. You generally would start as an operator that essentially loads the machine, presses go, and removes the part when it's done. You might be responsible for some measuring and other QA checks as well as maintenance on the machine, like changing out the cutting tools. During that time you would get some training on how to program CNC machines, which would require you to learn things like reading technical drawings and actually envisioning how a given part would be cut from any given piece of material. You most likely would also be trained on how to manually machine parts without the CNC aids. Eventually you would be familiar with all of this to start programming parts yourself.  The second and much more common way to becoming a programmer is to take courses on all of the things I mentioned. Technical drawings, CAD/CAM software, and manufacturing design classes are available at most tech schools, and even at some colleges. The downside to classes is that practical experience is pretty much the best teacher in the machining world. Most programmers that I know started working as operators while taking classes. Combine the two things and you can move along pretty quickly."

A project manager who went to university who's job is to collect information and report on it, as well as do some basic logical analysis on said data.   One can be automated with software and changing methodology and practice, the other will require a robot the likes that we will probably not see in our lifetime.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,dv282828,3,Tue Jun 23 22:58:35 2015 UTC,"If you carefully analyze the first word its states ""WE"" he seems to be placing blame on his generation, not the one after his.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,smartbycomparison,2,Tue Jun 23 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"My college degree got me an entry-level job. But it happened to be with a growing company, and five years later I'm not doing too badly for myself.  When I got the job though, I was one of about 400 applicants for six office positions. All of us that got hired had four-year degrees. One even had a Master's.   Essentially my degree got me that job, in a shitty economy, and some $$$ has a lot more purchasing power than zero $$$.   That's how the equation has changed nowadays. Even for entry-level positions, a degree is nearly essential, at least in an office environment. You just don't get squat for it anymore. It used to get you an office with a desk, now it just keeps you out of the unemployment line, if you're lucky."

College was affordable for Mike Rowe's generation but now it's so expensive that students have to take out loans to afford it. But if they can't afford it then they should put off college and work in the meantime, right? I agree, but that's easy to say in hindsight.  In reality, students are taught from a young age that not going to college is a path to failure. They are told they have to go to college right out of high school in order to survive and are encouraged by councilors, teachers and parents to accept loans in order to make it possible.  They aren't taking the easy way out. They're doing what their parents and told them to do and now that the whole thing is back firing the parents are putting their hands up like, ""don't look at me."""

What if the government decided against austerity and embarked on an endless cycle of borrowing the money to pay for them? What if the endless stream of cheap labor from 3rd world to 1st world is flooding the labor pool and making 1st world labor less valuable? What if industry was relentlessly exported from 1st world to 3rd and child labor was exploited and environmental and safety processes were ignored, while final prices did not move of the consumer and the industrialists pocketed the money? What if the banks figured out how to soak you, the government, and the system and calculated that it was well worth buying elected representatives to corrupt the system? What if while all this was going on, a culture of youth despaired of succeeding and rightfully envisioned that they would be worse off than their parents in life and felt as though worked sucked and was pointless?"
QuotesPorn,3auft5,MTknowsit,-3,Wed Jun 24 10:24:13 2015 UTC,"You might be the exception to the sort of thing he's talking about; did you think of that?   Didn't you have friends in college who were coasting on student loans or their parents' money while you worked your ass off?    My generation is probably the most educated ever compared to the generations in the past.    If you consider having a degree to exclusively mean the same thing as ""educated""; but in many other senses of the word, we know far less about the world around us and how common things work than our preceding generations did. Ask someone with a masters in Anthropology how their car works or how to build a shed; ask someone with a masters in Engineering about something philosophical; you'll find that a lot of the time modern university education has overspecialized people without producing the ""universalized"" Renaissance man it once did.   The fucked up thing is getting past all the shit that earlier generations have left us with.    Every previous generation left their children with shit; the key as you get older is recognizing that in most cases it was still better than what they themselves were left with.    It's not the people, it's the system cause we sure as shit didn't have a perfect world to work with when we were born.   The system is flawed, but the system is made of people; and it is in fact in the instances where those people deny the Established Process and instead do what is necessary based on their intuition, memory, and knowledge that real progress happens.    The worst part about this quote is the fact that someone from an older generation would accuse us of having no guidance. Seriously? What kind of blamegame bullshit is that? Wouldn't it be his generation guiding us?   As though ""generations"" were cohesive groups of people that are having meetings on a regular basis about how to fuck over their own children. Mike Rowe has done as much as he can by showing people what hard work means and what is involved on a regular basis; if more of his generation had his mindset the things you're complaining about would be less of an issue. Instead of sending everyone to university for Gender Studies degrees that don't even really prepare you to be a barista, far more people would be apprenticing, learning how to be experts and masters of crafts and trades from the previous generation, absorbing a ton of institutional knowledge and wisdom along the way."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,moravec-transfer,6,Wed Jun 24 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you said, however   you'll find that a lot of the time modern university education has overspecialized people without producing the ""universalized"" Renaissance man it once did.   It has produced specialized people, but I wouldn't say OVERspecialized. There are too many things in life to figure out, and even if you studied 8 hours a day, every day for the rest of your life, I doubt you could comprehend fully how your television, car, airplanes, wi-fi, cell-phones, refrigerators, plumbing, weather, electricity, gravity, philosophy, etc. work.   People need to work for 5+ years just to get somewhat near the complexities of one single tiny facet of knowledge (like a Phd who understands 17th century Italian clothing, still has only scratched the surface of understanding history).   The only reason there ever could have existed renaissance men was because the scope of knowledge was so much more limited in the past, and we won't get close to that as long as people need to have jobs to support themselves to live.    Instead of sending everyone to university for Gender Studies degrees that don't even really prepare you to be a barista,   In the top 200 most popular degrees in the United States Gender Studies isn't even listed. A Liberal Arts degree is #3, but remember that undergraduate courses barely skim the surface of sociology, literature, psychology, and history. These degrees also give a lot of particular knowledge which is missing from High School, and I think its good that the bar is raised a little bit higher for citizens to have more education.  As for a personal anecdote, I know one person who got a Gender Studies degree who is employed at a children's hospital, and other getting a masters. Those are only two people out of the 150+ people I know in university."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,Ghandithegman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"I doubt you could comprehend fully how your television, car, airplanes, wi-fi, cell-phones, refrigerators, plumbing, weather, electricity, gravity, philosophy, etc. work.   I mean, this depends on what you mean by ""comprehend fully"". Every field has multiple levels of knowledge, and I'm sure you can agree that it's better to climb up at least to the first or second tier in as many fields as you can, so that you're at least conversant about a wide variety of topics and prepared to deal with them inasmuch as they affect your life.  You don't have to know how a TV works, but it's nice to know enough about them that you can shop for one effectively. You don't have to understand how an engine works in detail or know exactly how to fix one, but you should have the basic theory of a four-stroke in mind. You don't have to know how airplanes work, but you should understand how lift works around a wing; and so forth and so on.   The only reason there ever could have existed renaissance men was because the scope of knowledge was so much more limited in the past, and we won't get close to that as long as people need to have jobs to support themselves to live.   I think that's a fallacy; there was plenty to know back then, as well. The difference was that renaissance men set themselves to become the master of a wide variety of fields. For you and I, it might be sufficient to be a jack of all trades.   Gender Studies isn't even listed. A Liberal Arts degree is #3   All of those Liberal Arts grads have taken Gender Studies in some form or another, but I digress..."

I am in IT, and it is scary the number of CS graduates that don't know the basics. It is partially due to the number of schools that are looking at education as more of a way to profit, and cut corners in classes. The university I went to was that way. Nearly 200 years old, but in the span of 10 years went from nearly bankrupt to 100 million in the bank, and buying up all the land around it so they can build massive buildings. Many of the classes were a joke.  That said, many people too after they have their degree are often not that useful, and quite often their degrees aren't remotely related to the type of work they do.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,Sack_to_the_Future,43,Wed Jun 24 11:36:45 2015 UTC,"I get the general message, and I think (like most quotes), you can't take a single quotation as a total summary of someone's thoughts. That being said, I think that his assessment that the college path is not ""hard work"" is actually fairly insulting for the people working 5 years on a Phd without little chance of money coming out of it.   Not to mention that just because a job has you working with your hands doesn't make it fulfilling, and we only have one life. Not to say that it isn't fulfilling, but I would wager that working on an oil rig, even if you make 100k is not the same thing as being on the cutting edge of cancer research -- at least to me. Then again, ""fullfilling"" is a subjective thing: I would think that a well-paying job would be enormously fulfilling if it means your family is provided for.  I agree with the general spirit of work ethic that he is proposing, but it  is no surprise the Tea Party took his quote, as I take it to be a little naiive and puts the blame/focus back onto the ""lazy"" starbucks-drinking intellectual who won't get a 'real"" job. I get that that is an extrapolation of a simple idea, but I really do think that that is the implication here.   There is a problem with denigrating the trades, and students really should be shown that those are acceptable options for a life career. That being said, there are other factors at work, not everyone would be great as a tradesperson, and the next 100 hundred years are going to see us looking at a future of automated jobs anyway, where large portions of the work environment may not even be an option.  Look at Alberta, where they just added in a fleet of driverless mining rigs -- it's not enough to say that we can go get a good hard-working job, when those ones might not even be around in 50 years.   How many tradespeople did you see laid off in 2008 when the economic crisis hit?  Tl;dr I agree that work ethic is important, there are other factors, do what makes you happy while being pragmatic about hiring"

If you desire a career that requires a degree, do everything you can to get there and afford it. If you are going to college because that is what everyone tells you that you MUST do, you are likely to be fucked.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,adelie42,4,Wed Jun 24 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"The only thing I find to be universally true in economics is that if you see a human doing something it's because a machine is too expensive to do that task.  Right now companies have driven wages to stagnation and job stability is completely not present. Corporations know that as soon as the math works in favor of a machine they will go that direction. They have a legal duty to their shareholders and it's in their best interests to reduce costs.  This means corporations fight wage hikes or anything else that makes people more expensive. They correctly point out that they will automate any tasks where humans become too expensive.  From a worker/employee standpoint this means you are competing with robots. Humans will lose in this competition.   So, what sort of work ethic should humans have? Should they try to be more robotic? Cheaper machines? Willing to work longer hours? How about shuffling off the human-robot maintenance costs to society (e.g. food stamps and other welfare programs that workers of Walmart use to survive).  Humans are moving in to completely uncharted territory where most things needing doing won't need a human doing it. Some think the future will be full of ""creative"" types. Others want to be luddites and smash the newer robots. Others want humans to just keep being priced cheaper. Some want to pretend these changes aren't happening, at least not to their job.  Me, I don't think there are easy answers, but what I'm most terrified of is the lack of discussion about the future and the sort of future we want to build. We're going to have amazing machines doing more and more every year. Self-driving cars WILL happen unless we legislate otherwise. It could be an awesome future if done correctly and where we directly use technology to improve everyone's lives.

QuotesPorn,3auft5,Yetanotherfurry,2,Tue Jun 23 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that there is a lack of discussion about the future. I suppose there isn't one single person or idea to blame for the fact that we, at most, seem to look only 10 years into the future for our political and economic ideas.   I'm sure it will be a rough transition, but my gut is telling me that more socialist policies seem to be growing in the developed world, and the mix of capitalist-socialist societal decisions is skewing towards empathy for ALL people in society.   That being said, wage stagnation has been growing for so long it is easy to see a future with an even more stifled middle-class. That's why its still important, as it always has been, to get political, even if the odds are stacked against you.   More importantly is to know what you are talking about, and read diverse opinions, so that you don't campaign and protest for something you don't really understand."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,Ghandithegman,2,Tue Jun 23 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"That being said, I think that his assessment that the college path is not ""hard work"" is actually fairly insulting   Where did he say that? In interviews I've seen of him he's very clear that college is the best choice for many people -but that it's not the only one for everybody. He'd be fine with someone getting an engineering degree, but shunning a cheap 2 year technical school to take on 30k of debt at a 4 year school getting a degree in Music History isn't a good decision. He's very clear that it's his generation's fault for treating trade schools like the plague."

And then doing it again, and again.    Sure, a good mining job today may be gone in 20 years, 15 years from now start learning a new trade or skill.  No one owes us lifetime employment and eternal bliss, just the opportunity to pursue happiness."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,mattmurf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that that is probably a very pragmatic way for a person to make a decent living. Personally, I would like to see an opportunity for free education so that re-learning a skill or re-certification won't cost someone who already has lost a job.    No one owes us lifetime employment and eternal bliss, just the opportunity to pursue happiness.   I agree with you that there is no single person who owes us eternal bliss, as I doubt anyone can ""make"" a person happy 100% of the time; however, I also am not a big fan of disparaging people who already have $30,000 in debt.   You could argue that they should have made a different decision in the past, but, like me, many young people are pressured, or, at the very least, slightly nudged into a degree without much of a prospect of a job.   There is probably not one solution. I would suggest: 1. More encouragement of trade jobs, and communication of where jobs actually are to students.   Free post-secondary education, so that if a student ends up in a major like Drama Studies and is unable to find a job, they have the opportunity to pursue a better major. Similar to the notion that jail is not about punishing, but about rehabilitation. Most people want good lives, and so many people, unfortunately, choose the wrong major out of the gate.  Free market-place valuable certification courses like First Aid, Dangerous Goods hauling certificates, language courses, and pretty much anything to do with web development, programming, and software development.    Also, as a side-note, some professions do not do so well in a capitalist-leaning framework (like education). We have to balance market demand with what we need in a society. When the market encourages teachers to have very little pay, this affects students and creates a society of less engaged and educated individuals.   New Deal-esque creation of jobs funnels money back into society: creating jobs for, just a theater for instance, (even if they are employed at $30k/year) would ensure that there is some societal good for the excess of people who have pursued a non-marketable degree. This also promotes art and culture which is a net good with a more abstract economic value."

Our higher education system has been watered down to the point that anyone can obtain a degree with very little effort, as long as they can pay their tuition. As a result, employers have very little regard for applicants' education.  This is all important because influential people keep pushing the narrative that laziness, not a lack of opportunities, causes poverty. We all know individuals who bust there asses at two or more jobs for decades just to keep their family fed, housed, and clothed.   Until we recognize that a flawed economic system widens the inequality gap, not laziness or a lack of ambition, then the problem will only get worse (and celebrity commentary will only get more hyperbolic)."

QuotesPorn,3auft5,DarthContinent,2,Tue Jun 23 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the ""system"" is designed to provide a never-ending flow of disposable people to corporations.  Poor education means the bulk of people, especially in poor areas, are hobbled from childhood, especially if they come from poorly-educated families in low socioeconomic classes. This means no skills, no vocation or college, and thus they become ripe for the picking by corporations looking for automatons to man the fryer and flip burgers and work for just enough hours to avoid needing group health care. Lack of education also, of course, makes for a docile, self-absorbed, consumerist work force which won't care to unionize and which is taught from an early age to be compliant.  These people, especially those with the unfortunate combination of lack of impulse control and no financial sense, live paycheck to paycheck, maybe occasionally hitting up ridiculously high interest cash advance places to buy the latest and greatest consumer goods for no good reason. If they decide (or accidentally) have kids, guess what, it's the next generation of poor fucks coming online in a couple of decades to keep the burgers flipping.  I don't think Mike Rowe is necessarily making a blanket statement about all people of a given generation, but I'd guess he's making an extrapolation based on first-hand experience. In his stint with Dirty Jobs he's probably seen lots of people with a serious work ethic doing shitty jobs, and on the flip side sees entitled younger people in social media circles mocking those working people or just being self-absorbed and arrogant. Just my guess, I don't know of the man beyond the TV show."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,Crownless-King,7,Wed Jun 24 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"This quote was taken out of context and used without knowledge or permission by the Tea Party.  His post explaining said situation and his thoughts on this matter:  https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/1012057572137719:0  I get why people immediately go on the defensive when they hear broad generalizing statements like ""a generation... "" as though you could clump such a large group into a single category. It's easy to get indignant and put your blinders on.  But I think it's important that people don't immediately jump to conclusions without stopping to consider the source, context and at the very least keeping an open mind to the ideas being expressed and a contemplation of their value.  Kneejerk reactions won't lead to a more thoughtful discourse on what is a real issue in America (and many other developed nations) right now, regardless of where you may fall in the discourse.  I see alot of those kneejerk reactions, consider what he Really has to say about this, and even if by the end you have an opposing viewpoint, I think we'd all be better off and more knowledgeable for it."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,datums,9,Tue Jun 23 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"His defence does not, in my opinion, significantly change the spirit of the original quote. It's just the fleshing out of the common right wing trope of blaming young people and their coddling parents for their generally poor career and financial reality. There are not even a fraction as many ""jerbs"" available in trades as there are unemployed, or underemployed young people.     Add to this the fact that Mike Rowe did his University degree in communication studies, before going on to becoming an opera singer, and shop at home TV presenter. He has also hocked a variety of consumer products including Fords, Pharmaceuticals, and Premium jeans.      So for him to be lecturing millenials about their lousy work ethic and thin skin rings a little hollow. He also fails to consider the fact that economic downturns annihilate trade jobs almost overnight, as has just happened in Alberta, formerly the trade job Mecca of the Western World. But they got their workman's comp and their employment insurance, so they will just live off the government teat until things get better. For many seasonal trades workers, this is an annual ritual.     But no. The problem is the work ethic of the deeply indebted generation that just mortgaged their future for a chance at a decent life."
QuotesPorn,3auft5,Crownless-King,2,Wed Jun 24 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"You are definitely correct in that renewed interest in trade jobs would not singlehandedly account or resolve unemployment. However renewed interest in a strong trades sector is a positive, if still not an end all solution.  As for his career, I think it has little to do with the subject matter. It does not take a coal miner to extoll the virtues or raise valid criticisms of coal mining. A TV personality that extolls the values of hard work and trades does not by prerequisite need to have been a steel worker or ticketed welder.   I can see how you might feel that someone who has had a...softer(?) work load, rather than hard work he promotes, that raises criticisms towards those that look down upon said jobs might seem ""hollow"" but as I previously said, I beleive you can be an advocate for certain careers even if you yourself do not work them.   It is his choice of career that led him to be such a large advocate of the trades, and he has truly done good work helping other gain employment and training through his foundation and raising awareness of these job opportunities.  Also, my interpretation at least, he's isn't placing the blame, at least entirely, upon this generation. He's placing it on his own. He fully recognizes that the current system of education, the costs associated with it, and it's emphasis on jobs that may not materialize, are a product of his generations doing that has hamstrung the current generations efforts to be employed, satisfied with their work, and prosperous.

If I could pay my rent any other way than work I would do that and stop working. I do my work half-assed, with no interest in the field I'm in and no desire to have a career in this field. Nobody notices my work, nobody cares about my work, my work doesn't positively influence the world and I do not get paid much. I have no family, house, vacation or expensive hobbies I need to work for, no goals, no dreams, no ambitions. Work is quite literally the bane of my existence. It is keeping me from just gaming all day, which is what I really want.  The idea that work is some noble venture meant to improve yourself and the world around you is for me just flat out untrue. My work exists to make my bosses richer and throw me a tip so I don't starve. That's it. So yeah, Mr. Rowe is pretty spot on. I really don't give a shit about work. But it's not because of my parents, who both worked for 40 years as teachers fulltime. It's not because of the way they raised me.

There are numerous ways that individuals and companies have found to pressure/""force"" people to give them their money while still retaining just enough evidence to claim thay the transaction was 100% mutual."
QuotesPorn,3awjgu,liberulo,4,Wed Jun 24 03:28:58 2015 UTC,"And it really simplifies what ""Benefit"" means in the larger picture. A peasant displaced by land privatization (before which land was either feudal or communal, therefore not free market) in 18th century Europe, or even by the same thing in 21st century Africa, might get forced out of their homes and end up in a free market relationship where they work to benefit of their boss in exchange for the benefit of not starving, but it would be difficult to say that the free market was a net benefit to that individual.  Did it benefit their society? That's always debatable. Civilization in the long run? Jury's always out there. But that individual? Naw. He got fucked over."
QuotesPorn,3awjgu,Vilageidiotx,-5,Wed Jun 24 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"Monopolies are often a byproduct of government action not free market. Often because of protective legislation and policies that make it near impossible for competitors to enter the market. If that isn't the case it tends to be a simple byproduct of time. Most industries end up becoming a two horse race anyway. Pepsi and Coke. Hertz and Avis. Time Warner and Comcast. Apple and Microsoft. These didn't happen by accident. All of these industries became the leaders because they offered the superior product that beat out all the other competitors that were in the market when the industry first started.   The good news is when this happens it opens the door for the next industry through innovation and invention. Case in point Netflix. Before that you could argue that Blockbuster had a monopoly on movie rentals. Where are they now? Bankrupt because they didn't adapt in time. In my opinion monopolies are made to be scarier than they actually are. Sure they are big and can control a lot of things. They also are not mobile and are slow to change with consumer demand. You also assume that raising a price has no cost. If a monopoly decides to raise the price of its product, it also makes the alternative more viable. No matter how big you are you can't escape the laws of economics. When the gas crisis hit a few years back and gas was near $5 a gallon you couldn't sell hybrids fast enough. Investments into alternative forms of energy rose. The Tesla is right around the corner. If what you say is true and the oil companies know that we are willing to pay $5 a gallon, why not just jack up the price and take the huge profit margin? Why keep it where it is now around $2.50-$3? Because when they raise the price they know they accelerate their own grave."
QuotesPorn,3awjgu,asshat123,12,Wed Jun 24 03:40:15 2015 UTC,I'd just like to point out that the reason monopolies don't exist and aren't very dangerous now is because of federal and state laws to prevent them. The reason monopolies aren't an issue in America is because it's not a free market

QuotesPorn,3ar6yl,Valthonin,4,Tue Jun 23 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"From my liberal perspective, there are only two easily available opinions on Chomsky. He is a complete genius, or a complete quack.  I am somewhere in the middle, but if I express my opinions on Chomsky to any of my liberal friends I get called an idiot, as though I just haven't read his books, or I'm a brainwashed Fox news watcher.  Chomsky is great at creating a believable narrative, maybe it's the fact that he is a linguist.  He holds the facts very highly and is quick to remind people of the statistics.  I believe it is easy to present the fact, but it is hard to draw any conclusions from them or put them into context.  Chomsky is right about a lot of the things he points out, but what he claims the cause of those things are is what I, and anyone who aren't far left, feel we need to criticise.  The trouble with that is that none of us can seem to create a narrative as convincing as his (might be the fact his professional career revolves around language and human nature)."

We're not writing scholarly journal articles here and neither you nor I have or are going to engage in a discussion predicated on lengthy citations or digressions for the sake of documentation or empiricism. Tell me what you think.   My challenge could have been framed as a question:  Do you think the only form of power is negative? Do you think all self interest leads to negative outcomes?  What about money? What about physical force? What about social pressure, such as love? All negative? All selfish?  Even the premise of 'selfish' as only benefiting oneself doesn't stand up to scrutiny."
QuotesPorn,3ar6yl,Sohanstag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:46:51 2015 UTC,"It's got nothing to do with writing scholarly articles, it's just good English and logic. If you're going to claim something it is good practice to then give an example or statement to explain it.  Questioning my position isn't the same things as having your own  position. My position is simply this, that seeking power is a purely self involved act. I've got every example in the world to back me up, dictators, politicians, corporate leaders.   Do you think the only form of power is negative?   I Think power is sought for self involved reasons. I don't really want to go into negative and positive, it is way to vague an area to be in, and before you go ""oh but you said yourself you have to explain you position"" I already have, so I'm not going to repeat myself here.   Do you think all self interest leads to negative outcomes?   I don't really care if some self interest leads to positive outcomes for other individuals, such as a dictator taking care of his son etc. What I can say is that self interest by definition leads to only caring about yourself and to an extent those closest to you, and this means not caring about everyone else.   What about money?   What about it.   What about physical force?   What about them   What about social pressure, such as love?   what about it? also it's not a social pressure, it's an evolutionary instinct. Unless you're talking about strict marital love.   All negative?   what? money, physical forces, evolutionary instincts are just there, they have no intrinsic negative or positive nature.    Even the premise of 'selfish' as only benefiting oneself doesn't stand up to scrutiny.   Except that that is the definition of the word, so again, if you're going to claim stuff, have the courage to explain yourself. I would have phrased it as only seeking to benefit oneself, whether some other people benefit along the way is beside the point.  Think about this, why does the person seeking another person to rule always seek the person who has no want in ruling, but of course, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. these are premises that has existed in one form or another for centuries. I've never heard the ones that say ""power is ok as long as it's not negative""."
QuotesPorn,3ar6yl,MasterDefibrillator,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"Saying 'back up your statement' as a reply is, again, worthless. It's a tactic for evading a question or challenge, which you've again done. And if you're mad about questioning a position without providing one then I suggest you read no more Chomsky. He is legendary for never providing his own position and only critiquing.   You've also dismissed out of hand three specific and major examples of power structure, so I don't see how providing more will help. I'll do so anyway. You say 'every example in the world' supports you: what about teachers? Parent Teacher Associations? Football teams? All involve a power structure on a small scale and the world has power structures in the political arena, social, etc. from the small to the enormous, involving billions. You've just claimed they're all bad. Who's being general, vague, and providing no definitions? At what point along the spectrum from the school board to the prime minister do people suddenly become horrible for seeking 'power'?  You seem to have a very narrow definition of 'power' and 'selfish' so, far from saying the definition supports you, I'd say it's the root of this discussion. Selfishness benefiting others is the core claim of at least one major...I hesitate to call it a philosophy, so let's say 'perspective.' All others at least acknowledge 'selfishness' to be a primary drive, if not the main drive, of the human animal and, depending on how cynical you are, therefore not all bad. I could direct you to an entire book whose premise is that selfishness is the only drive of every living thing. What then?  ( edit: and lest you say it's a book by some crackpot, here you go - The Selfish Gene )  I suspect this conversation is done. You've merely repeated yourself a couple of times. If you're a Chomsky devotee, my sympathies. I was simply stopping by to throw a tomato."
QuotesPorn,3ar6yl,Sohanstag,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"Saying 'back up your statement' as a reply is, again, worthless.   I agree it is quite worthless, but so is a discussion where you do not explain your statements and claims. So if you stop doing that, then I can stop repeating that worthless statement.  Obviously it's a gradient, that's what the whole "" power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" means. So obviously the amount and type of power is very relative to the discussion, you can't talk about parent teacher associations and compare it to dictatorships. Yes power structures exist, but I was never talking about the existence of them, so I think you're starting up a completely different conversation talking about those, rather than people who seek to control large amounts of power. I by no means want to be an absolutist, so I'd surmise by saying that the relative power is directly proportional to the probability of attracting inherently and wholly self centered people.   You've just claimed they're all bad.   So no, I have done no such thing, because at no point was I ever talking about the intrinsic nature of power structures.  I have never claimed that selfishness is intrinsically bad, all I have ever claimed is that one who is wholly preoccupied with themselves means they have little to no ability to care about other, except when it affects themselves. And that this position tends to lead to power seeking. So again, you've brought up a separate subject in talking about the inherent evolutionary usefulness of selfish thought. If you keep doing that then I don't think I'll end up replying."
QuotesPorn,3ar6yl,MasterDefibrillator,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Well that was easy. I agree with all that.

In the end, power is only sought by those who want to be above other people, and those who do not understand the relative insignificance of their power in the grand scheme of things. Power is sought by those who are wholly preoccupied with their own individual existence.<   So if you'd like to go back to that, fine.    I'm happy to make the assumption that everyone 'only' cares about themselves, and that's not a bad thing. You'll note that, in your original statement, you imply that's intrinsically bad through your counterfactual, hence my response. Are we now in agreement that selfishness is inherent and is not all bad?  You then say power is 'only sought by those who want to be above other people' with no regard for the type of power. If you're restricting yourself to dictators/autocrats/politicians you happen to disagree with (which is why most people suddenly become opposed to 'power') then we mostly agree. Who needed to clarify and provide examples?   Why do I care? Isn't your meaning obvious? No. This is Chomsky we're here to view, and Chomsky critiques all western powers without regard for circumstance, motive, or plausible counterfactuals, and that's very frustrating. Also because I kinda think Chomsky's perspective is naive, and it's irritating."

You'll note that, in your original statement, you imply that's intrinsically bad through your counterfactual, hence my response.

Don't misunderstand me, I do think that wholly or only self centered thought is a bad thing, particularly from an evolutionary stand point. So no, I do not think that everyone only cares about themselves, but that is not the same thing as saying selfishness is inherent and not bad, which is something I would agree with.   ou then say power is 'only sought by those who want to be above other people' with no regard for the type of power. If you're restricting yourself to dictators/autocrats/politicians you happen to disagree with (which is why most people suddenly become opposed to 'power') then we mostly agree.

So I would clarify by saying that the relative amount of power is directly proportional to the probability of attracting those who are wholly preoccupied with selfish thought. This is the root of the problem that Chomsky is referring to though, it doesn't really matter if wholly selfish or not people become president of the parent teacher association, what does matter is if wholly selfish people become president and CEO of a medical corporation, or country. These are the kind of powerful that the quote refers to, and the kind that should be challenged."

Funny cause the very quote we're all discussing implies the opposite. He blames white America for not only not pulling the knife out but not healing the wound. Yes, he was a black nationalist, but that doesn't mean he didn't think white society owed him and other blacks something.   In fact, here's a direct quote from Malcolm X that says that very thing:    If you are the son of a man who had a wealthy estate and you inherit your father's estate, you have to pay off the debts that your father incurred before he died. The only reason that the present generation of white Americans are in a position of economic strength...is because their fathers worked our fathers for over 400 years with no pay...We were sold from plantation to plantation like you sell a horse, or a cow, or a chicken, or a bushel of wheat...All that money...is what gives the present generation of American whites the ability to walk around the earth with their chest out...like they have some kind of economic ingenuity.

For one, I think the passage you quoted was taken a bit out of context...Google-Fu initiated...It took a while, but I found a larger portion of this quote so you get some context to wrap around his words.  There was only one place where I could find this passage with more than just the quoted portion, the preview of ""By Any Means Necessary"" on Amazon.  Someone asks Malcom X, ""If it was our white ancestors who bought you and enslaved you, we are their children. We are the new generation. Why don't you call us your brothers?""  Malcom X responds with, ""A man has to act like a brother before you can call him a brother. You made a very good point, really, that needs clarification. If you are the son of the man...."" And this leads into the quoted text.  So I feel like Malcom X wasn't calling for help. He was explaining the source of the tension coming from those in their movement. He was explaining their impatience towards anyone who might lean on the argument that progress has been made and just takes time."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,nate263,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure the added context changes the meaning of Malcolm's remarks much since he's still saying that any white ally of his movement owes him something given the source of his relative wealth.

I knew Malcolm X was a black nationalist and therefore believed in separation between the races (for at least some of his life). The last quote of yours I think is more of a denunciation of white allies in the struggle than a relinquishing of what he saw as black Americans' rights to something like reparations.  The question is whether he believed white America owed him and other black Americans anything. And the answer is clearly yes. In fact, he said in at least one speech while he was still a member of the Nation of Islam that white America should be the ones to pay for blacks to return to Africa to establish the black nation he envisioned.   So no, he did not have a pure and unadulterated do-it-on-our-own mentality."

If you think slave reparations today wouldn't be an accounting nightmare and a political ulcer, you're drinking the Kool-aid.   Contrition must be met with forgiveness in order for true healing to occur. Instead we have the continuous nursing of grievance, resentment, and distrust, like the Critical Race Theorists who regard the Constitution as illegitimate due to its former language regarding slavery.  We're not moving past racial division by reinforcing the old divisions. Racism will never be fully eradicated (unless you eradicate human stupidity and group think first) but racial harmony can be built in its place. Skin color ultimately is about as important as hair color, and I feel truly sorry for people who define themselves, others, or allow themselves to be defined on the basis of it."

QuotesPorn,3ammfm,SWEARENGN,3,Mon Jun 22 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"If you read my exchanges, you'll see Furgeson is a prime example. Read an article on the DOJ report on Furgeson, linked in one of my comments, to get a sense for the extent.  Here are links to sources documenting further examples of structural inequality accompanied by illustrative excerpts:  Report from the AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)   Disparities in quality of care are common:   Blacks and AI/ANs received worse care than Whites for about 40% of measures.   Asians received worse care than Whites for about 20% of measures. Hispanics received worse care than non-Hispanic Whites for about 60% of core measures. Poor people received worse care than high-income people for about 80% of core measures.    Disparities in access are also common, especially among Hispanics and poor people:   Blacks had worse access to care than Whites for one-third of core measures. Asians and AI/ANs had worse access to care than Whites for 1 of 5 core measures. Hispanics had worse access to care than non-Hispanic Whites for 5 of 6 core measures. Poor people had worse access to care than high-income people for all 6 core measures.     Wall Street Journal article reporting on the ""Racial Gap in Men's Sentencing""   Prison sentences of black men were nearly 20% longer than those of white men for similar crimes in recent years, an analysis by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found.   From Johns Hopkins Magazine: ""Research shows food deserts more abundant in minority neighborhoods""   When comparing communities with similar poverty rates, she discovered that black and Hispanic neighborhoods have fewer large supermarkets and more small grocery stores than their white counterparts. Bursting with junk-food options, these smaller establishments rarely offer the healthy whole-grain foods, dairy products, or fresh fruits and veggies that a supermarket would provide. When it comes to having healthy food options, says Bower, ""the poverty level of a neighborhood certainly matters, but even beyond poverty, the racial composition matters.""   From the Department of Education: ""Expansive Survey of America's Public Schools Reveals Troubling Racial Disparities""   The data released today reveals particular concern around discipline for our nation's young men and boys of color, who are disproportionately affected by suspensions and zero-tolerance policies in schools. Suspended students are less likely to graduate on time and more likely to be suspended again. They are also more likely to repeat a grade, drop out, and become involved in the juvenile justice system.  The 2011-2012 release shows that access to preschool programs is not a reality for much of the country. In addition, students of color are suspended more often than white students, and black and Latino students are significantly more likely to have teachers with less experience who aren't paid as much as their colleagues in other schools.   There you have concrete examples of structural inequality in healthcare, education, the criminal system, and food availability. If you look for more, you will find more. So given your stated position, the only question should be ""what can we do to stop this widespread injustice?"""

QuotesPorn,3ammfm,caesarfecit,-3,Tue Jun 23 02:00:44 2015 UTC,We fund the everloving shit out of public schools in even bad areas and still can't get achievement on par with countries who spend less than half that much. Something else is going on there.
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,abathologist,3,Tue Jun 23 02:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are many other factors contributing as well. I didn't intend my few examples to constitue an exhaustive list of necessary corrective measures or current ills. U.S. eduction is deeply unequal:   Fifteen percent of the American score variation is explained by socio-economic differences between students. Less than 10 percent of score variation in Finland, Hong Kong, Japan, and Norway is due to socio-economic differences. source   And this inequality is almost certainly linked to the dramatic inequality in public school funding.   But I think you're right that it's not just about the amount of funding to schools. It's also about how that money is spent (e.g., the US lacks public pre-K eduction, in contrast to any European counties). And even more important, I expect, are the compounding factors like unequal conviction and incarceration rates, food desserts, prevalent cultural and structural racism, history of economic disadvantage and prejudiced residential policies, etc. It all adds up."

QuotesPorn,3ammfm,SWEARENGN,-14,Mon Jun 22 04:44:12 2015 UTC,"There's so many sweeping assumptions and statements of unthinking dogma there that I'd be here for an hour addressing each one point by point. In the spirit of good faith, I'll take apart an easy one:   We could immediately cease policies that lead to over-policing and over-incarcerating black people for petty, non-violent offenses.   Setting aside the dubious merit of these policies in their own right, let's look at the clear assumption here that these policies are targeted at black people. Perhaps you can explain why the mandatory minimums for meth are the same as those for crack? Or why the only thing the DOJ could come back with after their civil rights investigation of the Ferguson PD was a pattern of over-ticketing and traffic stops that disproportionally affected the poorer members of the community?   All you see is statistical evidence hinting at disparate impact and you immediately assume the intent behind them is racially motivated, either covertly or through unintented but covertly approved consequences. That's logic that a paranoiac would be proud of.   All I'll say is that Malcolm X would be disgusted by the notion that black people can't succeed without the welfare state and every white person self-censors themselves until every last vestige of racism is wiped clean. IIRC, Malcolm X was all about black people living life on their own terms and not needing the approval nor support of white people.   I have better things to do than to be quoted unthinking left-wing dogma."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,Apollo_Screed,18,Mon Jun 22 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"Unsupported accusations of ""unthinking dogma"" should alert any thoughtful person to the uncharitable and uncritical spirit of your reply. But I can give easy retorts to the substantial objections you raise:   I said nothing about the intent behind policies that contribute to systemic inequality. The concept of systemic (or ""structural"") inequality does not entail or require the intentional imposition of discriminatory policies. The point is, the ""real motive"" behind a policy is irrelevant if we have clear evidence (as we do) that the policies cause or perpetuate unjust states of affairs. However, far too often the motive is explicitly racist. For instance, your claim about DOJ findings in Furgeson is dead wrong. The first page or two of the report summary states clearly that racist practices and intent were widespread in Furgeson. But CNN sums it up nicely (source, including the report itself):   A Justice Department civil rights investigation has concluded that the Ferguson Police Department and the city's municipal court engaged in a ""pattern and practice"" of discrimination against African-Americans, targeting them disproportionately for traffic stops, use of force, and jail sentences.  You made up a bunch of stuff I didn't say. I didn't say anything remotely like "" black people are incapable of succeeding without x"".  While I do beileve we would all be better off if we had a more socialist economic system in the US, I also didn't say anything about the welfare state (effective public education is a basic necessity for a functioning democracy, it is not a ""welfare"" issue). Nor did I say people should be ""self-censoring"" their racist thoughts: I said they should ""root out"", meaning eradicate, them. One doesn't do what's right because those who suffer injustice couldn't possibly succeed without such charity. One does what's right because it's right.   FYI, you come across as a self-righteous, intellectually dishonest, fundamentally misinformed, prick."

QuotesPorn,3ammfm,Wargala,-20,Mon Jun 22 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"The civil rights act has been in effect for 50+ years now. If you're black and still blaming others for your situation with all the advantages you have like special programs, scholarships, Etcetera, then you only have yourself to blame. If you can't get your shit together with all thane you're hopeless.  Let's not forget we put Asian people in internment camps long after slavery was outlawed and they seem to be just fine.  Hell, there are Asian people who come here, don't speak a word of English and still are successful.    So what's your fucking excuse?"
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,screenwriterjohn,15,Mon Jun 22 03:15:40 2015 UTC,You expect over 200 years of damage to be fixed in 50 years?

I expect people who literally weren't alive when these things happened, to be able to make a success for themselves.  Tell me why we have black CEOs, black president, black executives, black business owners, etc, how they are still being ""held back""?    Stop making excuses for those who blame others for their situation.  If you can't get your shit together in America with all the opportunities it has to offer, then where the fuck do you expect to go and make a life for yourself?"
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,abathologist,10,Mon Jun 22 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"First I'm explaining why people are in these situations not giving them an excuse.    With all the special programs, scholarships, and playing the race card whenever possible, yes.   What special programs?    I expect people who literally weren't alive when these things happened, to be able to make a success for themselves.   You don't have live through a tragedy to be affected by it. And ignoring the the fact that poverty is an extremely difficult cycle to jump out of. Ignoring the fact that people who are born in a neighborhood with shitty education will not have such an easy way to success than people who live in better districts.    Tell me why we have black CEOs, black president, black executives, black business owners, etc, how they are still being ""held back""?    Who says these people are still being held back? And you're ignoring the social prejudice as well. Just because the government finally decided to see black people as equal citizens doesn't mean every American has,"
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,wsdmskr,4,Mon Jun 22 04:11:24 2015 UTC,I've always loved the argument that having a black president shows that we have a post-racial society. That's like saying the English having Queen Mary back in the day meant sexism had been resolved before the 1600's.

QuotesPorn,3ammfm,icanhazlurk,4,Mon Jun 22 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"We also never forced Asians into the ghetto. We also never fought a war on drugs to imprison Asians. We also never supplied crack purposely to Asian ghettos. We also haven't extreme cases of police brutality focusing entirely on Asians. We also don't have many cases of people going and shooting and bombing Asian churches. We also have never had the need to give Asians scholarships as they have been allowed to go to their own choice of college for a long time. So like Malcom just said, you're trying to pretend the knife isn't even there."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,wsdmskr,-5,Mon Jun 22 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"No, we forced them into internment camps, which are worse than ghettos, we flooded Asia with opium, Asians don't typically carry out a majority of crime. Asians typically are able to get scholarships based upon academic merit, rather than skin color.  There's no pretending the knife isn't there, it simply isn't. All racism you see these days is the occasional idiot, or made up racism perpetrated by sjw types and the politically correct sensitive sissies out there."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,icanhazlurk,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"Okay so the internment camps were not worse, not to mention they don't even matter anymore, unlike the creation of the ghettos which still exists and still affects blacks every day. Now you're comparing two countries by bringing up the opium in Asia, which isn't smart because Asia has a much bigger crime problem than we do. By your logic it must mean there's something wrong with the Asians then.  I wouldn't expect a racist to use logic regardless, because otherwise you wouldn't be racist."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,Duncanconstruction,-4,Mon Jun 22 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"If internment camps don't matter anymore and they were 70 years ago, then why does slavery matter in regards to your earlier point?  You've just contradicted yourself. Plus, name calling is the first sign of losing an argument.  You can't refute my facts, so you resort to calling me a racist.   So, by your logic, being ripped from your home and forced to live inside what amounts to a prison, is better than living in the projects huh?  You obviously haven't a clue about either place if you think that.  Again, stop making excuses for black people who blame their problems on others. It isn't the man, or whitey, or anyone else who determines their success.  It's them. They can listen to the bullshit rap lyrics, homies, and other nonsense promoting drugs, gang violence, and misogyny. But if they do that, then they have no one to blame but themselves.  If they choose to educate themselves, use the available resources they have, and work hard, they can be as successful as they want.   They don't need pity from people like you, they need guidance to show them what can be achieved through hard work."
QuotesPorn,3ammfm,aeqvitas33,-3,Mon Jun 22 05:23:51 2015 UTC,"I uh, I never mentioned slavery. Anyways yes, in many ways the ghetto is much than internment camps. Murder and crime rates are a lot higher. In the inner city parts of Oakland an estimated 30% of kids suffer from PTSD. I'm sure you saw on Reddit not to long ago, some neighborhoods in Baltimore have a lower life expectancy rate than North Korea. Living in the ghetto is living in a constant war zone. Any major study will tell you black culture isn't the reason for the black community's current situation. Facts aren't racist, but you are."

You're an apologist for the lazy, the uneducated, the race baiters. You spew off facts without citation.  I think you don't like that I've pointed out flaws in your way of thinking and you don't like it.    But do tell, how is me pointing out facts and giving examples racist?  We are talking about a racial debate, and not once have I put down black people as a whole, called them racist terms, nor denied them the ability to succeed.  In fact, I've argued that they can succeed with enough hard work and determination. I've argued that the ghetto mentality and promotion of violence, drugs, gang hanging, and misogyny is what's keeping them down.  Yet, you can't refute that either."

Pulling the knife out all the way still isn't progress, it's just a necessary step before healing can begin. Even cleaning and treating the wound still isn't ""progress"", but it might be part of redress. I'd think progress can only begin  once the blade is removed, the wound healed, and genuine collaboration and cohabitation undertaken. But I'm just guessing, unfortunately I haven't yet read any of Malcolm X's writings. In any case, I don't see your point as revealing a problem with the metaphor, instead it seems to show its depth and aptness."

Admirer as I think I am Of stars that do not give a damn, I cannot, now I see them, say I missed one terribly all day.

This is what I know:  Lovers' oaths are thin as rain;  Love's a harbinger of pain-  Would it were not so!

QuotesPorn,3amaqf,Ebtn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:21:42 2015 UTC,"Well... that is true for the first game and the second game's original ending, absolutely. In both cases, the choice is largely meaningless - you're either postponing the inevitable end of the age, or you're continuing the cycle. Both ends are equally moral and immoral, and both are ultimately meaningless.  But in the second game, that changes somewhat. There's a video that explains it quite well here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdk_fvXG5xA).  The TL:DR version is that humans, despite being utterly helpless in the face of this cycle of Light and Dark that has cheated them out of being masters of their own lives, have always sought greater things, and that it is this search for something greater that defines humanity. Such is true both in the game and in the real world.  But with the DLC ending for Dark Souls 2, a wild card is introduced that basically makes your character immune to this whole thing, making you the one person in history who can truly work to break the cycle. With the aforementioned macguffin, taking the Dark ending of that game gives you this quote, as you are walking forward into a truly uncertain future."

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Maledicte,121,Sun Jun 21 12:29:30 2015 UTC,At risk of offending a lot of people.. if those he loves are Americans on American soil.. how is he sacrificing for them? The United States Military is NOT in the Middle East to defend America. This seems so obvious to me and yet so many people in America are fixated with the belief that the military is 'Defending our freedom.' It takes two seconds of logical thinking to realize that is not the case. I am not trying to condemn American soldiers.. they are doing their jobs and most of them doing it because they believe it's right.. but some of these patriotic beliefs people in America have are so ass backwards to me I just can't understand it.
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Alki6,228,Sat Jun 20 18:56:54 2015 UTC,My experience with soldiers would lead me to the assumption that he means his comrades on the battlefield.

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,10,Sat Jun 20 20:50:50 2015 UTC,Because a) America has fought righteous wars (as righteous a war could be) and b) a lot of people don't have the means to necessarily do much else.  A lot of fighters on the ground come from not very well off and not very educated families.
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,realigion,-6,Sat Jun 20 23:02:59 2015 UTC,A lot of fighters on the ground come from not very well off and not very educated families.   You should get a source on that. I have this which says otherwise
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,fromtheworld,8,Sun Jun 21 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't say otherwise.  The military as a whole has far, far, far more employees than fighters on the ground.  If you have applicable support skills, you will not be on foot patrol through Kabul. You don't think the people without support skills (comms, engineering, food, transport, fuckloads of administrative) are disproportionately those who come from less fortunate backgrounds with less education?  Oh, and ""less fortunate"" is relative. Note that we're in a massive recession, where even average Americans can't be expected to afford college. Economic depressions certainly include more people in the group of those who ""don't have the means to necessarily do much else."""
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,realigion,-32,Sun Jun 21 03:42:48 2015 UTC,Because a) America has fought righteous wars (as righteous a war could be)   Not in 70 years. And has fought my unjustified wars than justified   b) a lot of people don't have the means to necessarily do much else.   The yuppie Nuremberg defense   A lot of fighters on the ground come from not very well off and not very educated families.

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,16,Sat Jun 20 23:15:34 2015 UTC,That would make a lot of sense and would be completely understandable obviously but I just feel like the message this picture is trying to portray is the 'sacrifice for your country american hero' deal.

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,5,Sat Jun 20 20:28:37 2015 UTC,Humans wage war.  Nothing will stop that.  If this kid decided to go learn about brotherhood through the inevitability and horror of war; who am I to judge..
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,PSGWSP,-4,Sat Jun 20 21:03:31 2015 UTC,So that's your justification for participating in killing? Oh it'll happen either way so fuck it? I bet you think they're the savage ones too...  You know it might seem crazy but there are actually countries out there that haven't waged war in decades right?
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:25:14 2015 UTC,I bet you think they're the savage ones too...   We're all savages when put into the right circumstances.  Some of us just have problems admitting it.
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,PSGWSP,-9,Sun Jun 21 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought:  Maybe the kid thought it was a just, righteous thing to do because he had been lied to and manipulated for 18 years before taking an oath.  Dude, you're on the right track, but don't be a silly goose just because someone got lied to and made decisions based on falsified data."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,JustStrength,-12,Sat Jun 20 22:18:46 2015 UTC,So your defense is that they're stupid? Because many 18 year olds know and did know the wars were bullshit and never joined
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,6,Sat Jun 20 22:29:57 2015 UTC,"I never implied intelligence.  War is often counterproductive in general, but indoctrination and propaganda exist because that type of manipulation is extremely effective.  You don't need to be an idiot to believe well-crafted lies."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,JustStrength,5,Sat Jun 20 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but still:   Of course, the terrible things I heard from the Nuremberg Trials, about the six million Jews and the people from other races who were killed, were facts that shocked me deeply. But I wasn't able to see the connection with my own past. I was satisfied that I wasn't personally to blame and that I hadn't known about those things. I wasn't aware of the extent. But one day I went past the memorial plaque which had been put up for Sophie Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse, and I saw that she was born the same year as me, and she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler. And at that moment I actually sensed that it was no excuse to be young, and that it would have been possible to find things out.   -- Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary)"
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,johannL,3,Sun Jun 21 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"Again.  Not once did I state justification, or an excuse.  This is about empathy.  I find this important because many of these young men go out and commit atrocities they knew were justified, only to later learn that it was not.  At all.  And some may even realize that had they had the foresight to investigate the rationale behind their motives then they could have avoided committing said atrocities in the first place.  Shouting demoralizing and dehumanizing holier-than-thou speeches at people already dealing with inner demons of regret is not only an inconsiderate dick move, but it also further alienates the killer-come-wiseman.  This will not result in beneficial actions from either party, and only causes everyone involved to suffer more.  To put it more succinctly, see Human Code of Behavior Rule #1:  Don't be a dick.  And besides which that quote is using future knowledge to judge past action.  Hindsight bias."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,JustStrength,4,Sun Jun 21 10:25:42 2015 UTC,"And some may even realize   Yeah.. some, may. This doesn't address sadists or people simply obedient people though. Those are dealt with by setting boundaries. Not by demonizing them, especially since it's hypocritical to vote and pay for the wars soldiers then get to be scapegoats for -- but also not by hoping they will eventually get around, and judging them all by the best of them. Assume the average, not the outliers. And you know, I don't care so much about ""fixing"" people who have become soldiers but about future generations. If there is a way to be nice to soldiers while making future soldiers impossible, I'd be happy for that -- but IF it was required to not be nice, which can sometimes even just mean not saying yes and amen when they go on about honour and duty and sacrifice, while never bringing up Stockholm Syndrome like fish never bring up water -- then I would prefer that route over not hurting their feelings. Don't be a dick, but also don't be a brownnoser. If someone is old enough to kill, they're old enough to read a fucking book and think for themselves. If they're not, we have to discuss that issue, we can't just say ""oh well"" and hope they get a clue in their own time. The people they kill don't have that luxury.  And it's too simple to call people pawns. I see old people sending young people into wars with nothing but their tongues. To compare that with an inamate object that gets pushed with no choice of its own is too simple. Yes, they're victims as well as being perpetrators, but no, they're not pawns.   And besides which that quote is using future knowledge to judge past action. Hindsight bias.   Nope, you missed the point. She had all the opportunities available Sophie Scholl had, but did not really use them. It would have been possible to find out means exactly that."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,johannL,3,Sun Jun 21 10:52:54 2015 UTC,"I think we're arguing for the same thing, really.  This is going more off topic and onto the issue of the Warrior Culture in general.  Which is something I'd need to think on and research more before having any significant contribution beyond basic thoughts.  I just see too many people demonizing events that they don't have the right frame of mind to perceive and attempt to shed some illumination on it.  And I didn't miss the point with the quote, I got that she could have found out.  What I was saying earlier was, it's irrational to believe someone who has been fed propaganda and taught to be obedient (and without critical thinking and certainly without meaningful introspection) would seek out contrary information that was not readily available.  I mean, yes.  She certainly could have.  But if she was patriotic and believed in the general good of her fellow countrymen, she may not have had the impetus to do so until after gaining new data that was contrary and damning of the old data.  Good points though, and I'll let the puzzle of warrior culture fester in my brain today."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,JustStrength,-11,Sun Jun 21 11:18:07 2015 UTC,Except so many people saw through the lies. You're either saying stupidity or gullibility are legitimate defenses
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,5,Sat Jun 20 22:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which specific instance of lies you're talking about, but I can safely assume the World Trade Center attacks and the subsequent falsified reasons for entering Iraq?  If that's the case, I would say the bulk of the world's youth did not actually see through the lies.  I can't speak for all of America at that point as I was not nearly as informed.  But I can tell you, sources sending contrary information than what has become known as the mainstream media were few and far between and had to be sought out.  If you're already indoctrinated to the company line, you're not as likely to seek out alternative theories.  Especially if you're never taught critical thinking skills (and public schools are certainly anathema towards critical thinking).  I'm not saying either is a legitimate defense, my commentary is not about justification.  It's about empathy.  Hence my first response to you.  I agree with you - I'm just saying don't attack victims and pawns.   But it is very, very important to have these kinds of conversations so as to prevent other kids from making decisions based on uninformed reasoning."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,JustStrength,4,Sat Jun 20 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Intellect does not grant immunity to brainwashing. For example, a lot of cults are filled with emotionally vulnerable geniuses and smart people.  In fact, intellect can make you see a lack of meaning in your life and give you a misguided need to fill the hole in some of the worst ways."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,warped655,-9,Sun Jun 21 00:44:40 2015 UTC,Soldiers are the same as cult members? I wouldn't disagree
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,25,Sun Jun 21 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"A valid point, but as a soldier you don't get to pick and chose the engagements the United States gets into while in service.. There are many individuals who in the military for various reasons, including primarily for serving and defending their nation and countrymen, but get stuck fighting or participating in wars and operations they don't support. Of course, this would apply to his fellow soldiers as well; being willing to sacrifice himself for those around him in danger in conflict areas."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,callmenighthawk,13,Sat Jun 20 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"You've got the most important part down.  The thing most civilians don't get is that the politics really does not matter when you're risking your life in some shit hole.  You for the war? ""Fuck this place.""  You against the war? ""Fuck this place.""  What really matters at times like that are the people who stood by you when the shit sucked.  Politics is for when you have the free time to sit around and think.  It's one of the last things you think about when you need to act.  Hell, everything you believed could change in an instant but what bought you together was wanting to serve your country."
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,-25,Sat Jun 20 20:53:54 2015 UTC,You can't invade someone else's country and then complain about it sucking. War is political and being an idiot doesn't change that
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Denny_Craine,7,Sat Jun 20 21:29:37 2015 UTC,Wait... so you never complained when going to college or never complained at work?  Or is that some kind of nihilistic logic or some other bullshit term you pulled out of your ass?

If you think the war is unjust then just don't fucking join  This country has gone to war at least once every generation since WW2.

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Alki6,16,Sat Jun 20 20:30:20 2015 UTC,I hope you don't get downvoted for this. We have a misapprehension that what we're doing is for our freedom as if it's legitimately being threatened.
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,trainsacrossthesea,5,Sat Jun 20 19:16:37 2015 UTC,Yes exactly and that belief leads to people joining and then getting seriously injured or even killed.. similar to this guy. And if you want to downvote I'd love to hear your opinion on how this isn't true.
QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,PSGWSP,11,Sat Jun 20 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"It's this. I'm sometimes confused how we glorify the act without questioning the mission. Yes combat forges a bond, no one doubts that. But, maybe it's time to question the motivation of other people that put them in that situation. All why shouldering none of the danger or consequences of war."

And believe it or not we are doing some good things out there, not all of it mind you, but we are helping the local people. It's not always about just keeping your own safe, when you have the biggest stick sometimes you have to defend those who cannot defend themselves."

QuotesPorn,3aiv4u,Runnyn0se,9,Sat Jun 20 20:53:18 2015 UTC,I didn't say that at all.  What I did say was that you're an idiot for saying that the US killed all of the adults in Afghanistan.  You've taken a stat and applied funny logic to it to confirm your bias.  All while showing how little you actually know about Afghanistan or the war.  I really wanted to ignore you but it was just such a stupid fucking comment.

We're fighting where our enemies are; if we just pack up and leave tomorrow they don't go away and its just a matter of time before they pull something off in the USA again.

When people go through some serious shit it bonds them together, and that bond is one of the strongest I know. I don't know this guy personally but my guess is that he would sacrifice for those on his left and his right in combat, his brothers and sisters in harms way. A soldier doesn't fight solely for his hate of the enemy in front of him nor only for the love of his country who stands behind him, but ultimately to protect those around him to his left and right, for his brothers on the battlefield going through the crucible of death and horror. I would gladly give my life for my brothers, so they could go home and be with their families."

From 2001 to 2010 each year 92 military personnel per 100000 died each year. That's of all possible causes including illness and accidents. That's not even as high as the on the job mortality rate of fisherman.   Less than 30 per 100,000 die in combat each year.  the most well equipped and well manned military on earth attacks literally the poorest country on earth and then has the audacity to claim they fight to protect their ""brothers""?

QuotesPorn,3aig8i,Ebtn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"What I like of this quote is exactly that everyone can apply it to their own context. My point behind all this is that there is no absolute truth at all, so our mission is to find ""true"" expressions, sentences, art pieces. ""True"" meaning that they tell us something that we feel true. In this sense, a ""story"" is truer than an abstract truth, because it tells something relatable, specifically to us. In the end, we must be aware that all truth comes through some story, and if we are ready to focus on the story (to understand it, decode it, unveil it somehow) we are more prone to learn something useful and relevant for us."

So the opposite of light which is darkness. Notice that light starts at the border of darkness and darkness starts and the border of light.  Now imagine if there was only infinite light or infinite darkness in teh world. You wouldn't be able to see anything in either case because there'd be no border. That's why they need each other.
QuotesPorn,3ahgdf,OldTome,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"Alan is describing the notion of duality.  For our minds to make sense of the world we must put things in boxes and categories. So to label and categorize something you must compare it to something else.    If you see a beautiful attractive person you know they are beautiful because you have a memory or can directly compare them to someone who is less attractive or just plain ugly. But you see they go together.  It is only by the function of the ugly person that you know of the beautiful person and vice versa.  It's the same with everything and it can take you down a rabbit hole.  If it's blazing hot outside you know it's hot because you know what cool air feels like and you compare.  If you see a black smudge on a white wall.  It is only by the background, the white wall, that you can see the black smudge.  Maybe it's a black wall that's been painted white and the smudge is really the background black showing through.  Which is it?  It depends on your perspective. What's the true perspective?  Why all perspectives that when added together create the full picture.  But our minds don't work that way.  We label things very quickly and subconsciously and then move on.  We don't ever destroy the boxes and labeling habit.    If you lived completely without this labeling, judging I think that's what many say is being enlightened.  To see things as they are, all connected.  Here's chapter 2 of the Tao Te Ching for another explanation:   ""All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is.""  ""So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.

This happening isn't the only thing that made me reign myself in but it was the catalyst.  My best friend a few years ago was in bad straits financially. I'd loan her little bits here and there, and she would mostly pay me back, but not always. Eventually she convinced me to take out a $3,000 loan to help her get a house, and she would make the monthly payments. Stupidly, I did.  For a while she did make the payments, but then it became sporadic, and I began to have trouble getting anything out of her.   Come Christmas, she approached me and asked if we could take out another thousand on the loan, so she could make some payments and buy some gifts. She laid on the guilt really thick and told me she would for sure pay it all back, but I realized if I lent her the extra cash it was only going to be another grand I'd be on the hook for. I told her no, and from that point on she stopped talking to me. I ended up having to pay back a little over $2,000 of the original loan myself.   I tried to get more money out of her, but her boyfriend at the time was a police officer at the university where I worked, and she had him threaten me and my job if I kept after her for the money or tried to pursue any legal action.  Now I don't loan anything more than I'm willing to lose. If I get it back, I get it back. If I don't, well that's what I expected and I never loan that person anything anymore."

QuotesPorn,3abk43,funtoss,5,Fri Jun 19 06:47:40 2015 UTC,"Sangasu's story pretty much sums it up.   It's not one particular event at one point in time, it's a personality trait perceived as a weakness, it's a series of events years after years that I cannot possibly sum up. And it all stopped only because I fought for it to stop.   What never changed is that 1) they would ask too much of me 2) They knew it was too much but they would never let it show. They also knew I would never refuse - so these people are very sharp when it comes to human nature and know who to prey on, what strings to pull in you. 3) They would always say that they didn't know who else to turn to, but it was obvious they had never even attempted to ask someone else - because they knew it was too much and dared not ask a sensible, strong-willed person, lest they be put in their place. 4) They would never in a million years return the same favour, because, well, how could they possibly agree to such grand demands 5) Once they have gotten from you what they have almost begged for, or skilfully conned you out of, that very thing, that very matter-of-life-and-death demand, instantly becomes some unimportant afterthought, and they show no gratitude for it. Sometimes they even forget who they got it from, so you don't even get credit for it. 6) Some of them become so accustomed to it that they don't understand why you suddenly rebel one day and stop pandering to them. 7) When I stopped helping (mind you we're talking about people I've known for almost 10 years) they simply disappeared. My worth to them was never in friendship, but in usefulness. So I suddenly was left with my ""real"" friends, those who come over when they want to, not when they need something.  Sadly, it's not all over - I thought it was. A friend I've known for almost 15 years pulled a fast one on me a few months ago. She was someone who knew of my parasite-ridden past, and who had condemned these other fake friends for their actions, and now she went and did the very same thing. So it feels like I'll never be freed from that vicious circle unless I decide to stop having that stubborn, undying faith in human integrity, and simply never put my trust in anyone ever again.  I choose faith..."

QuotesPorn,3abk43,SUPERsharpcheddar,2,Fri Jun 19 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"It's not a con. It's not always black or white. We've been actual friends for that long, this I know for sure. And we remained friends when the others turned their back on us (at different times and for different reasons.).  Now she is in a very difficult place in her life, and it pushed her to become one of those people that she knew I had already had my fair share of. Of course my first impulse when things got bad for her was to help her, because that's what friends do. When she kept asking and asking, I obliged without hesitating, because a 15-year friendship does that. Also, she was very gracious through it all, it didn't feel like exploitation.   Let me add here that, for the last half of those 15 years, when everything was going well for her, I would see her very little. We would text each other a lot but a year or two could easily pass without us actually seeing each other. When things got bad for her, suddenly she was over at my house every day. This I did not hold against her. But it sheds a little light on our kind of friendship.  Now when things got even worse for her that's when she threw dignity and friendship under the bus and outright manipulated me to get what she wanted. The situation is complicated and I don't want to reveal too much but the gist of it is that she signed a legal document that she knew she couldn't possibly honour. She assured me it would be no problem at all respecting the terms of the contract, and mere hours later, when she had what she wanted and I couldn't do anything about it, she basically said the exact opposite. I do believe she was desperate and at a loss for a solution. Unlike my previous parasites, it wasn't a cold/cynical ploy, it was an emotional, impulsive and desperate move - and she pulled it off only thanks to that special kind of determination only desperation grants to a human mind.  The only thing I'll say about that is that it could be the final similarity I forgot to mention in my previous message, which is that your desperation does not place you above the law nor the basic rules of human integrity and decency.   When she realised that I was not going to bow down like so many times before (with my previous parasites), and that she had possibly put our friendship to death, she actually went out of her way to start making things right and respect the terms of the contract, by taking really drastic measures.   That proves two things to me : 1) She knew right off the bat that she wasn't in a position to respect the contract. Not initially. Not without those drastic measures. But she signed the contract anyway - believing it would all be okay, since I'm not the kind of person who fights back. 2) Our friendship means something to her. Otherwise she wouldn't currently be trying to save it now.   We went from 60 messages a day to 0 in 4 months. But I still think there's a chance we could be friends again and put that ""mistake"" she made, behind us - though I don't think I could ever truly forget how it made me feel. It is a reminder that, once again, if I don't set boundaries, anyone, even old friends, can be tempted to take too much.  I don't have negative feelings towards her - I hope she gets better soon and that she will get the result she desired so badly that she even tricked an old friend to achieve it - those incidents always make me feel negative things towards myself : what have I done to bring out the parasite in people? Do I have ""rip me off"" written on my forehead?"

Your undying faith in humanity attracts those who would abuse it--I've been there too.  After working for years with homeless people, I've realized that ""help"" is a complex issue.    The questions I have for you are whether you want people to change who they are.  You have faith in human integrity--what does this integrity look like; is there an ""ideal human""?  And what's at stake if human integrity doesn't actually exist?  Peace be with you!"
QuotesPorn,3abk43,frychu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Hello to you to!   The questions I have for you are whether you want people to change who they are.    If who they are is a dick, then yes I would like for them to change, and they should want that for themselves too. In this case it would just be a matter of improving yourself, not changing the very core of your humanity. I think that the only time when people don't change, evolve, grow, is when they're dead. So yes, one should always seek growth.    You have faith in human integrity--what does this integrity look like; is there an ""ideal human""?    ""To err is human"", so does the saying go. This would have us believe that the very nature of mankind is to be flawed, imperfect. And if so, then so be it. Do not seek to be ""ideal"" if such a thing is indeed out of reach, seek to be ideal knowing that on your never-ending way to it, you will at least become a decent human being, and at most, a commendable one. Again, it comes back to the notion of improving yourself, and to the concept of life as a succession of changes.   And what's at stake if human integrity doesn't actually exist?   Philosophy at 3am on a Saturday! Oh internet! I believe we are all born ""blank"" and our life experiences make us orbit good or evil, or sticks us somewhere in between. I don't believe we are born racist, anti-Semitic etc.   But if this is all wrong and human integrity/goodness/decency doesn't exist...my first and immediate impulse is to say everything is at stake. We wouldn't be able to trust each other and function as a society, we wouldn't be able to believe in ourselves or have any kind of positive self-image or empathize with one another.  But I think what's misleading here is the word ""exist."" Human integrity does not exist on its own, in and of itself like some magical entity, outside of our choices and decisions. If we are ""blank at birth"" then integrity is nurtured. That's a comforting thought because it means that if one is devoid of integrity, it's not a definitive condition. It can always be taught, acquired, striven for."
QuotesPorn,3abk43,TheGodOfPegana,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:19:03 2015 UTC,"don't change... when they're dead   I absolutely agree with this, but...   one should always seek growth    ...this needs to be proven.  Lots of people would rather be asleep/dead; why wake them up?  I had a weird thought experiment with a friend.  Some people need constancy and stability, and they typically want to be surrounded by people who agree with them.  What if we developed a drug that could unhinge these people from these needs?  They would start to question everything and seek contrary opinions.  Being a med student on a psych rotation, my friend believes this would drive these people insane and would rather not force it on them.  Now, this is a far cry from ""changing people,"" but the question is, to what extent do people really need to change?  Most of these ""stability-seekers"" are what I would call ""zombie-humans.""  Why wake them up if they don't want to?   improving yourself   Yeah, I've noticed that sometimes, defining an endpoint is counterproductive (e.g. existential crisis), especially when it's the journey that counts.   It can always be taught...   Implies that integrity is a skill.  I've thought about compassion in a similar way; how does one teach integrity and compassion?  It's clearly not enough to set a ""good"" example, otherwise the world would be full of integrity and compassion by now (as both are beneficial to survival).  Especially when I talk to friends who work with autistic kids, it seems like compassion and integrity could be innate rather than a skill, but I don't know.  Do you have experience teaching such things?"
QuotesPorn,3abk43,frychu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"would rather not force it on them...Why wake them up if they don't want to?   Exactly. Consent is key. It's your journey. It wouldn't make sense to force someone into it. It would be like forcing them to be thirsty. That need comes from you alone. Now if they're happy the way they are and they are not hurting anyone, I guess that's fine. They could always improve their life further (can't we all?) but that doesn't mean they should feel forced to do it.    to what extent do people really need to change?   If we're talking about the same kind of toxic people in my previous messages, then obviously I believe it is in everyone's best interest that these people work on themselves, a lot. But if you mean generally, I don't necessarily see change as ""becoming something else"" but also as ""becoming more of yourself"". You speak of ""journey"", I see change as the journey towards selfhood. If one ever needs to change, it would be in the same way a shoot ""changes"" into a tree. Then that's as far as you go/grow.   You also speak of ""stability"". I don't see that as being opposed to growth. A tree needs stable ground to grow. You don't build a house during an earthquake. If by being stable you mean being static, then we go back to my first point above : stay put if that's your wish. But it would be nice if the place you're at right now doesn't involve you being a dick.   it seems like compassion and integrity could be innate rather than a skill, but I don't know.    In both cases, human beings end up being endowed with both qualities, so it's a win/win. It reminds me of people that say ""without religion where do you find your moral code?"" and people reply ""You find it within yourself!"".   If we define integrity as ""doing the right thing"" then that leads to yet another question : How do we know what's right and wrong? Who decides? Do you know or do you have to be taught? There are things that I feel you should know naturally : it's wrong to kill, etc. But also, across cultures and eras, what falls within the realm of right and the realm of wrong, have greatly differed and still do. So that part of wrong/right needs to be taught, because it's man-made anyway. But even if it can be taught, whether you want to listen to your teacher is another story. I've been taught maths my whole life, it is teachable, but I never learnt.     Do you have experience teaching such things?   The only thing that popped in my mind is when I made one of my relatives (A) become more empathetic towards another relative (B). Now this is a tricky way of phrasing it. I didn't create inside of A the ability to empathize, I simply opened their eyes to B's reality (simply by providing information) and that made A realise that B deserved A's empathy. So I didn't create a tree out of thin air, I simply poured water on a seed that was already there. I didn't teach A integrity, I simply gave A a reason to be.  There are people out there who are immoral, literally without morality inside of them. Maybe for those people teaching them integrity would be as useless as teaching a blind man to see."

You speak of a ""blank slate human""--at what point does such a human become a dick?  By being initially blank, it implies that humans simply amplify whatever energies they receive.  Is it really the fault of a human for being a dick, then?  But even if it still is their fault, what do you want to do about it?  We can go play the victim when hurt by a dick, or we could turn around and actually begin to understand the dick (e.g. asking questions like mine above).  I, like you, want to believe in the goodness of people, and I believe that goodness can be nurtured through things like understanding (a requisite of love).  Thus, I propose that when you find a mean person, simply love them through understanding them completely.  We suffer much when we love much."

They keep making bad choices, and then when the consequences hit, they run to me, with promises to be different, and anger at the system that keeps ""making them"" make bad choices, because it can't possibly be their fault. I am too trusting and gullible, and it has taken me years and years to learn that if I don't set boundaries, it's not like other people are going to wake up and say ""Boy I sure have been taking advantage of dolphinesque lately. I guess I'd better thank her for all she's done, and see if there's anything she needs."" Nope.

QuotesPorn,3a8pj0,thereds2015,5,Thu Jun 18 13:18:48 2015 UTC,"its more psychological and sociological. In this day and age, i believe the younger generation is becoming more open to the idea of one species that unites rather than race that divides.  But for most people and still some youngsters today, when you grow up and notice the amount of people around you, and we are a lot 8 billion by now i presume, you need something to quantify your own existences' validity/importance. Some use their faith, others use their talents, but most use a form of self-affirmation through degrading of others. You feel better about yourself when you keep a mindset that a certain race or group of people are inferior, that they are flawed or less intelligent, or more criminal.   Its the same belief that strives forward religion in a sense. The notion that people are so afraid of being non-important, that their values and their existence is false, they will condition themselves to great lengths to further the lie, that they are the chosen one, that they are the superior being.   In the end i believe it to be just a coping mechanism for their existence. Same as heaven is for most religions. It is a coping mechanism for a issue that is complex to them, death in this example."

No, the real problem, the rub of the whole matter, and why folk like Nye are involved in the obfuscation, are the reasons no one wants to study our species along any kind of delineation: what if science proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, one race (breed) is shown to be cognitively inferior? Imagine that shitstorm.  So they don't touch it; hand off! Let's say some nice words about how we're all the same.

We segregate ourselves into categories and those categories then become sorted in order of importance, it can start with parent child, family, neighbourhood, class, school, dsitrict, state, country, color etc etc.  We use these differences to categorize ourselves and categorize our relationships.

I always have reservations about these sorts of questions. How would one go about determining such a thing? There's so much variation within the groupings, physicality is hard to measure and it's also something that is obtained from physical activity. You'll have to define by what you mean by naturally too.  If you want to focus on height (something you can't change by working out), the average height of a male in Ireland is 177cm, whereas in China's mainland it's 172cm.  I'm from Ireland, and I'm only 163cm in height, so on average most Chinese males in their mainland are taller than I am.   This goes against the stereotype doesn't it?

QuotesPorn,3a8pj0,ThugznKisses,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:11:54 2015 UTC,"In as brief an explanation as possible, phenotype is what is expressed, whereas genotype is genetic allele combination. Think of phenotype as what you see on the outside and genotype as what causes it on the inside. An example is eye color. You might have a PHENOTYPE of brown eyes, yet have a GENOTYPE of one copy of the dominant brown eye color and another copy of the recessive blue eye color (again, gross over-simplification). For this reason, a man and a woman - both with PHENOTYPIC brown eyes - can have a child with blue eyes if they both have blue hiding in their GENOTYPE.

QuotesPorn,3a8pj0,heartbreak_hank,12,Thu Jun 18 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"You're right, genetics don't lie (usually). However, genetics also don't classify us into races such as Asian and ""Black"". Although certain areas around the globe have certain distinct features that appear to make people classifiable and portionable, these changes boil down to very small, relatively insignificant changes in genetic bases. In fact, most major ""races"" have a very wide range of genetic diversity, as this leads to a healthy and dynamic population. For this reason, two Asian people are likely just as different as an Asian and a black person (assuming they're both of the same gender). Thus, although appearances lead us to believe otherwise, race is a social - not a genetic - construct. If you need any links on the topic, I can get some when I'm not on mobile."

Not quite. An Asian person and a black person will, on average, have about 15% more genetic differences than two Asians. 85% of genetic diversity is found throughout the entire human species, 6% between major regions, and 9% between smaller regions.  Edit: 6-15%, rather, depending on where in Asia the two Asians are from, so more like 10%."
QuotesPorn,3a8pj0,EurocentricZionist,4,Thu Jun 18 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting video, I haven't seen this one yet! I get the feeling, however, that the producer has an agenda to pursue. If I understand him correctly, he accounts for allelic frequency. In this sense, he is correct; people from different regions share alleles more frequently. However, he shies away from the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These single base changes most frequently have a neutral effect as opposed to a beneficial or deleterious one. These rare changes alter alleles. Over long periods of time, SNPs cause a change in allele frequency between populations without affecting observable phenotypes. If you'd really like to argue for race as a biological construct, I would begin to look at presence of genetic information from other species (Neanderthal, viral, etc.) or the occurrence of traits due to high selective pressures (lactase persistence and sickle cell heterozygotes come to mind). I hardly see either of these things as enough to give rise to distinct races.  Obviously that is an opinion. I'll post some links when I get access to a computer.  My honest question to you is what would you consider a race? Assuming distinct races do exist, globalization yields a confounding problem. Is a blending between two races a new race? If you crossed race A and race B between two different couples, the two offspring would have different proportions of traits from race A & B. Are these two children the same race or a different race? What about people along city/country/continental borders? But now I'm just babbling. Hope this finds you well :)"
QuotesPorn,3a8pj0,man-of-God-1023,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the well thought out response, and new information  I don't have a strong science background, so everything know is either based on my own layman observations or information I've seen somewhere, which you pointed out, usually has an agenda.  To answer your question, ""what do I consider a race?"" I'd have to say what I can easily observe.  The NFL and NBA have an insanely high proportion of Black players.  Is this because they work harder than Whites, Hispanics, or Asians?  Or do their bodies have characteristics that gives them a higher chance to succeed in these physical contests?  Skin color is a characteristic that most people use to determine race, as well as eye shape, and hair type.  All of these characteristics can be manipulated (by genetic mutations or personal modifications), but they are our main indicators.  The other indicators you mentioned (lactase persistence and sickle cell) added to the ones I've mentioned would probably give you a very high success rate at guessing race.  With more information it seems like it would become easier and easier to make distinctions.  The makeup of our DNA, how much Neanderthal/cro-magnon/homo habilis or whatever, can be determined (I think, I don't know)  If they can draw large differences among the different ""proto-humans"", why wouldn't it be possible with the different humans we have today."

Conservatives have been whining non-stop ever since about losing this showdown. Followed immediately by the GOP diving headlong into the Southern Strategy, deliberately pandering to racists to win elections. The map of the red states has matched the map of the Confederacy for decades. They are the same people.

QuotesPorn,3aaokh,qmechan,8,Thu Jun 18 18:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think more so the individual thinking.  I like this quote because the sentiment behind it is great, the world does need visionary men.  It needs men and women who fight for their vision against those who don't believe in it or have interests against seeing it carried out.  However what I dislike about this type of worldview is the festishization of the individual.  As I said the world needs visionary men and women but their ultimate success in seeing that vision through is never solely individual.  Every single successful person in history has had help, often a tremendous amount, along the way of fulfilling their vision.    A basic unpolitical (and perhaps overly simple) example I could use would be Michael Jordan.  He is the greatest basketball player of all time and he deserves an amazing amount of credit for the 6 championships he won as a player.  I agree with that. But what I dislike is how when people discuss this they often overlook the fact that Michael Jordan won all of those championships playing with Scotty Pippen, a player who himself might be one the 30 best basketball players of all time. And this says nothing of the countless coaches, teammates and other people who helped make him the player he became. Jordan undoubtedly is the best and worked hard to become the best, but he didn't do it alone and that fact should not be forgotten."
QuotesPorn,3aaokh,HistoricalNazi,3,Thu Jun 18 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"I can’t fault Rand, to a point at least. I know that her writing is dreck and her politics masturbatory, but I have sympathy. You can say she’s wrong, but you can’t say that she’s not a smart woman. And think about where she was born--nothing. Nothing was said about the exceptional, the brave, the ones with visions. They were all told to sit down and shut up by a government who cared for nothing but itself. Coming to America, where you were (relatively) free, was her first time not being terrified. Each of those buildings, those skyscrapers, were testaments of greatness to those that designed them--and there were so many in her first trip to New York, it astounded her. It’s like living through a war--Nothing else is going to scare you that much after that, and you might get a tad obsessed over the other side."

I guess what irks me about her is the people who have adopted her philosophy.  Too often it seems that the people who espouse her philosophy are people who were very fortunate in life and are seeking a way to justify their wealth or standing in society.    And again that's why part of this quote is inspiring because the world does need visionary men and women.

PLAYBOY: Many pessimists insist that our nation has lost its dignity and is headed toward self-destruction. Some, in fact, compare the condition of our society to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire and the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah. Are you that gloomy about the future of America?  WAYNE: Absolutely not. I think that the loud roar of irresponsible liberalism, which in the old days we called radicalism, is being quieted down by a reasoning public. I think the pendulum's swinging back. We're remembering that the past can't be so bad. We built a nation on it. We must also look always to the future. Tomorrow—the time that gives a man or a country just one more chance—is just one of many things that I feel are wonderful in life. So's a good horse under you. Or the only campfire for miles around. Or a quiet night and a nice soft hunk of ground to sleep on. Or church bells sending out their invitations. A mother meeting her first-born. The sound of a kid calling you Dad for the first time. There's a lot of things great about life. But I think tomorrow is the most important thing. Comes in to us at midnight very clean, ya know. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. As a country, our yesterdays tell us that we have to win not only at war but at peace. So far we haven't done that. Sadly, it looks like we'll have to win another war to win a peace. All I can hope is that in our anxiety to have peace, we remember our clear and present dangers and beware the futility of compromise; only if we keep sight of both will we have a chance of stumbling forward into a day when there won't be guns fired anymore in anger."

But having just got in from a large unit run this morning, I have to disagree with your general sentiment. It's not over until it's over.

QuotesPorn,39z6z9,Rand0mtask,5,Tue Jun 16 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"I totally see what you're saying. I've always had trouble equating suicide to 'quitting', but I can see how some people believe this. I think perhaps I can see that for some people, in some circumstances, it's more like escaping rather than quitting. Not sure whether that really applies to Thompson though - perhaps his choice was more like 'resigning' in the end. If someone genuinely doesn't believe there are any enjoyable/positive experiences left in their life (and they have felt this for a long time, like Thompson), I can see why they would make the choice he did."
QuotesPorn,39z6z9,molaison,3,Tue Jun 16 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"Thompson was kind of obsessed with the idea of being able to kill himself.  He was terrified of being trapped in his own body, a shell of his former self.  He talked about eventually committing suicide openly, even as a young man.  Still, theories that he was assassinated persist, there are a few strange details in this case.  For one, it was very odd that he killed himself where and when he did it.  His beloved sanctuary in Colorado would have made much more sense as a location for his death.  Also, his family were on route to visit him at the time, and he was aware of this.  The timing on this makes no sense at all, he was very fond of his family."

Then watch the movie. Depp - who lived with Hunter while studying for the role, Del Toro - arguably at his finest, and brilliantly directed by Terry Gilliam. It's one of those movies that does such a good job, it can actually detract from the source text.

Whoever edited the film and put Depp's monologue over it was a genius. Otherwise it is a collection of very pretty but non-sequitur shots. I get that he was trying to fit the book, but Thompson absolutely knew story structure and flow.   It was originally screened without the monologue, and probably by all accounts sucked some massive cock. There are some great scenes (the Opening, White Rabbit) but there is just no flow."

From what I understand, it far predates the famous line in Orwell's 1984.  Wikipedia says it is a quote from Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground, published in 1864, although it was likely written at least in part during his imprisonment in Omsk or subsequent draft into the Siberian Army Corps in Semipalatinsk.   Notes is considered by many to be the first existentialist novel.[citation needed]"

QuotesPorn,39urnm,Trebulon5000,-5,Mon Jun 15 19:33:27 2015 UTC,"This quote is some bullshit, because as it happens, there's an entire Western social generation that by and large massively shafted their kids. ""You'll only become an adult if you forgive us."" Yeah, right.  PS: Fucked up the planet too, which of course is the same thing as shafting your kids."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,PMalternativs2reddit,5,Mon Jun 15 09:09:59 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about that, being angry and resentful doesn't hurt other people. It only hurts you. The analogy that opened it up for me is ""Swallowing poison and expecting your enemies to die"".   There are actually constructive ways to fix the problems they caused, but rage isn't necessary to do so."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,KomradeKitsch,2,Mon Jun 15 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"If anything, anger that is born from something you love being at risk that is directed against the situation itself can be used as a fuel to still find strength when you're almost broken, the anger that also arises from something you love being at risk that is directed against the ones that brought about the situation on the other hand will slowly eat away at you, revenge is a cruel, unsatisfying poison.  If you funnel the good kind of anger into constructive ways and let compassion lead you, you will understand your enemies, and you will have a chance of finding a way to solve the situation."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,kannoneer,-3,Mon Jun 15 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Like most readers here, I do of course know that platitude (of your first paragraph). But forgiveness != anger management. ""Why won't you just forgive your unpunished abuser? You'll feel much better afterwards! Just let it go!""     As you said, there are constructive ways to at least start fixing the real problems, but none of them start with coddling and delaying disempowerment of those largely at fault. We can have Truth and Reconciliation Commissions once the old regime is well and truly out of power.   I should note for the record though that Nowlan wasn't actually a Boomer; he was a member of the Silent Generation – so my critique of his quote wasn't directed at the man himself."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,PMalternativs2reddit,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Nobody asks you to bow before those that wrong you, but instead to stand above it all and to not be petty, and instead to be benevolent and to try to understand the whole situation, including the aggressor's attitude, including what exactly went wrong on their side.  Give Naruto Shippuuden a try, it's extensively devoted to explaining why that way of thinking of yours is the wrong way to approach problems."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,kannoneer,-3,Mon Jun 15 18:46:51 2015 UTC,that way of thinking of yours is    ...a straw man.
QuotesPorn,39urnm,PMalternativs2reddit,3,Mon Jun 15 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"Not every generalization is a straw man, I could describe what I mean in much greater depth, but I'm honestly too lazy to do that, so I guess you just need to trust me on that.  To make you trust me, think about this: what kind of people are the happiest and most successful? And I don't mean in a purely economic or societal sense, but in an overall, fulfillment-wise sense. In other words: how exactly are the people that are the most fulfilled?  They're usually benevolent, they are very calm generally but can still be passionate when it's about something dear to them, they are determined, and they have lots of love in their lives, from them towards others, and then from others towards them too.  Who you are is not only about your circumstances, it's only partly about that. It's mostly about how you are, how you react to your circumstances.  Pessimism might occasionally solve some problems because short-term, it's the easier way, but Pessimism and true greatness don't mix.  You can also look into some writings of Marcus Aurelius, he was a Stoic (in the ancient sense of the word) and pretty spot-on on what's the right way to go. There's lot's of quotes from him on the internet, and they're usually short and pregnant, here's a good collection from his work Meditations."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,kannoneer,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"Not every generalization is a straw man   ...but this was, because you're arguing with yourself.   Your ideas about where I'm supposedly coming from are not intriguing to me, and I would not like to subscribe to your newsletter."
QuotesPorn,39urnm,PMalternativs2reddit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not that good at conveying my intentions and thoughts in text to be honest, I'm better at this when I talk to people face-to-face. It saddens me that I couldn't convince of my way of thinking.  I tried to understand your viewpoint by applying your arguments and seeing if they work out or not, I can only ask you to do the same, otherwise a discussion via text cannot work. Maybe you don't trust me because you, obviously, don't know my qualifications, I hoped the righteousness of my argument would be enough, but maybe I didn't formulate it well enough...  I hate to talk this drastically because it might seem hurtful, but I'm not well-spoken enough to convey it otherwise, so please know that this is not my intention: I'm not sure where I went wrong in my argument, you can't go wrong if you let those who are successful inspire you. Or are you saying they are not actually successful in life, and that instead you have found a better way already? And the result of that better way of living would be the conclusion that forgiveness is a sign of weakness? You're the weak one here, vengefulness is easy, being the bigger man is the hard thing! Are you honestly saying you've found a better way of living than people like the Dalai Lama, Jesus and Buddha? A way that doesn't highly value magnanimity?"

It may not be the same but we all have problems and we all have issues and we're all doing our best to be happy and make it through the day.  I used to see people posting on social media ""I love my life"" and I'd think to myself, ""Man, my life sucks"".

If they are older than you then you are wrong and you had better be respectful of your elders. So how do you forgive someone who won't even admit to the fault?"
QuotesPorn,39urnm,Weegoh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:14:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're dealing with people who can't forgive themselves and likely don't forgive others for their mistakes either.

QuotesPorn,39pk0k,Slithy-Toves,5,Sat Jun 13 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it just be a case of ""enjoy it now"" vs ""enjoy it later""? Instant gratification vs delayed gratification?   If you spent your gold here and now, you'd ""enjoy"" it now, but may not have enough of it left to enjoy it later in life.   If you saved up your gold and invested in it wisely, you may not enjoy as much of it now, but you could enjoy spending it later, and possibly feast grander and for a longer period of time than you otherwise would have been able to.  I guess either premise is a bit ridiculous if we're talking about it in the context of The Hobbit.  I doubt Hobbits ever invested in anything to begin with, and they were definitely leaning towards the ""live day-to-day"" sort. Despite that, Bilbo at least seems to not have irresponsible when it came to saving some form of expenses. His food stores were adequate enough to feed the entire expedition team and what-not. I guess Hobbits hoard food instead of gold?"

QuotesPorn,39pk0k,TracyMorganFreeman,0,Mon Jun 15 06:17:40 2015 UTC,"This is a very backwards way to look at money. Money is not the economy, economic activity generates money. What your money is is a representation of how much supply you added to the world, it is the debt that everyone else owes you. By not spending it you are actually lowering your consumption and reducing the prices for everyone else. (In principle, in practice increasing consumption can drive investment leading to lower prices as well, though spending will always push the demand curve up, it just may affect the supply curve as well.)   Though this only applies to fiat currency, for actual gold hoarding it would remove it from circulation, but for fiat currency the government can and will just provide more if there isn't enough circulating.  (E: I think I misinterpreted your point, that money only has value to you when you're spending it, which I agree with. I'm just very tired of seeing the ""only spending is good for the economy"" perspective, so I was reacting to that.)"

I am pretty tired."
QuotesPorn,39pk0k,RegisteredJustToSay,10,Sat Jun 13 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"To a point sure. Being financially responsible buys freedom to enjoy life.  But the key word here is hoarding. Not saving. Not investing. Literally sitting on massive piles of wealth and growing ever-hungrier for more. It's an insatiable desire. When are your piles big enough? A million? Two? A billion? Never?  By valuing food and cheer over gold you can keep in mind the ultimate goal of gold, which is supposedly to help people live and thrive. You'll be better equipped to know when to stop working on the size of your hoard and when to head to the pub or play with your family or just concentrate on what's important to you.  Right now the world's economy is basically only suffering from lack of people spending on things. Business would hire if there was demand, but there isn't, so they make more money by socking that money away rather than hiring."
QuotesPorn,39pk0k,manachar,-1,Sat Jun 13 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to a certain point.  No one except a neurotic bunch literally hoard though. You lose money on inflation that way. The quote in question is clearly written in a more stylistic language for the sake of artistic merit. I'd guess the meaning of the quote is more along the lines of ""People would be happier if they focused less on accumulating wealth"".  The world's economy is doing great at the moment however. S&P 500 is higher than it's been in close to 50 years and profits are soaring. The economy is very prosperous right now. Perhaps the economy could be doing better if people were ""hoarding"" less, but since it's doing better than it has for many decades I don't think anyone really cares.  In regards to focusing on what's important to you... try telling a minimum-wage employee with massive school debt to just do what they love and what they care for. I've heard it described as ""borderline insulting"". It's simply not that easy for 90% of people. Our society is kind of set up to make you work as much as possible unless you consciously act in opposition to that. In general only people who are financially responsible, make good investments and educate themselves about wealth creation have the luxury of doing what they want to do when they want to do it (except the born wealthy). I'm not only talking about investing in stocks or real-estate either. Things like which profession to choose and so forth are also very important financial investments.  Live to golf? Skip the degree, educate yourself and develop a network as well as marketable skills, then get a part-time job doing whatever and spend the rest of your time golfing. Move to a more remote town as well so that your skill-set is more valuable.  Want to be a professor? work your ass off in school to get perfect grades and apply for stipends, etc, etc. Focus heavily on research experience and fuck the rest. Consider moving to another country for free or paid education.  Want to live for work? Go ahead along the ""normal"" route, you'll be happy because there are lots of businesses that will love you.  Doing the things that matter to you are largely a matter of luck and/or planning. There are so many routes in life and also so much information out there on how to succeed regardless of which path you want to go down, even if things will of course never be ""perfect"".  I've studied this subject for many years and it's incredibly hard to know what the right thing is to do, but the information is out there and you can definitely work it out if you put your mind to it. Nothing will ever be perfect... but it doesn't have to be either. So who cares?  I get pretty passionate about this topic, so I apologize if the wall of text is a bit much, but I hope it's an moderately interesting read at least."
QuotesPorn,39pk0k,RegisteredJustToSay,0,Sat Jun 13 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful and reasonable response: I hear your passion. I suspect there's a whole lot of common ground we have, we just take different viewpoints on certain points.   I'd guess the meaning of the quote is more along the lines of ""People would be happier if they focused less on accumulating wealth"".   That my take on the quote too. I might add one word though: ""People would be happier if they focused less on accumulating excessive wealth.""   The world's economy is doing great at the moment however. S&P 500 is higher than it's been in close to 50 years and profits are soaring.    The S&P 500 is a measure for how well the stock price on a bunch of the largest companies in the world are doing. And there's no question that they are doing well. Profits are good and investing in the stock market is one of the only ways to actually use extra money to return a profit.  This is not a complete measure of the world's economy. I suspect you know as much and are just using this as a short hand. While the stock market and their various indices measure the health of stock prices (which is at least partially tied to profitability). Others will use the GDP for similar shorthand.   The problems with these measure is other indications really show that many countries (especially in the ""western"" world) have other severe indications that something's not going well. Wages are stagnant and even down. This is despite the fact that every worker is extraordinarily more productive that in the past. Jobs are down, more people are unable to find work and what work they find is for less pay. Household that used to by one wage earner now require multiple to stay a pace. Personal leisure time is down, student loan debt is insane, and of course medical costs in the US are bankrupting and destroying vast portions of the populace (number one cause of bankruptcy the last I checked).  There are of course a bunch of amazing thing in the economy right now. I'm typing this on a computer that would have been unfeasibly expensive just a few decades ago. Some people have enough money that they're taking huge gambles on startups (e.g. Silicon Valley). Standard of living is generally rising worldwide.    In regards to focusing on what's important to you... try telling a minimum-wage employee with massive school debt to just do what they love and what they care for.    Absolutely. The market is cruel, but at some point if doing what you love can't pay the bills you'd be better of focusing on what does. Shoot, I'm not doing what I got my undergrad degree in because I pivoted it into something that pays better.  My favorite quote on this comes from a talented artist I knew: ""Until your painting is sold, it's not art – it's just a storage problem.""   I don't believe this quote however would say that a person should become a starving artist. I linked to the zenpencils comic as I felt it hit the nuance right. You don't have to be a starving artist, but you also don't have to join the rat race. Find a happy medium that works for you to maximize what you find important.  Incidentally, the plight of the minimum wage American worker is one of the biggest reasons I would not agree to the statement that the economy is doing great.    Things like which profession to choose and so forth are also very important financial investments.   Very good thinking and I like the turn of phrase of looking at profession and skills as financial investments.   Doing the things that matter to you are largely a matter of luck and/or planning. There are so many routes in life and also so much information out there on how to succeed regardless of which path you want to go down, even if things will of course never be ""perfect"".   Absolutely agree. I do think that society, as it plans the economy can do a better job of focusing on all individuals having the resources they need to navigate this wacky world as best they can. Right now they are overly focused on GDP and stock prices and other purely financial measure. If the rules of the game tilt things too much to one strategy then other valid life strategies become too heavily penalized.   Overall, I think the world has been doing ""okay"". It could do some things better (the market really doesn't do a good job of ensuring that negative externalities like environmental degradation are included in the market price). But the last 100+ years of human history has seen a massive improvement in peoples abilities to focus their lives on food and cheer. Heck, look at the incredible explosion in craft brewing! ""Beer is proof that God loves men!"" Therefore so much great beer must be proof we live in a blessed time.  But the future isn't guaranteed to be better. As the world changes different strategies may be needed to help keep the focus on empowering every individual to focus on food and cheer or whatever makes that person most complete.   I guess that's a long winded response to why I like this quote. It's about a goal in life, one that remembers that money is just a means to get to those goals."
QuotesPorn,39pk0k,manachar,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:49:00 2015 UTC,"By far the best response I've ever gotten on any of my comments. Thanks a lot for a well thought-out response! I think I'd be more sad that my original comment was downvoted so heavily if it didn't spawn this discussion. I absolutely love discussions.   If you don't mind I'd like to continue, since I'm enjoying it so far.  And for full disclosure: my passion is business and finance. I love those fields a lot. As a result I'm likely very biased in favor of finance and a money-centric worldview. Particularly money because it's an almost one-to-one measurement of how much of my passion I am able to do and have successfully done. It's kind of like a trophy-case. I absolutely agree with you that from one's own personal perspective the variable to optimize for should be ""enjoyment"" and not ""wealth"". I think the reason our viewpoints might differ the ways they do is primarily because I could optimize for either of those and end up with roughly the same ""path"".  I don't really care for money as a thing, I just need it to do the things I love... and they're also a natural consequence of doing the things I love, so of course it's an important metric to me.   If the rules of the game tilt things too much to one strategy then other valid life strategies become too heavily penalized.   It's funny, but I think it's actually closer to the opposite. It may be a bit trite and a slight oversimplification but from my research and observations supply and demand reign heavily in the job market as well as the ""ease-of-life"" market.  It's never been easier to have a good life as a carpenter, for example. A hundred years ago it was an incredibly over-saturated profession and carpenters were paid almost nothing for their work.  Now carpenters and tradespeople are earning almost as much as engineers.  There is of course a decent difference, but a much smaller difference than you might expect, especially when some people spend 20k a year for several years attaining a degree to become an engineer.  It's become harder to BECOME a carpenter, certainly. Less straight-forward because there is less of an abundance of carpenters, but it's much easier to succeed as one.  How about business?  This one I can speak on a bit more personally since I'm an entrepreneur. It's both never been easier and never been harder to start a business, just like for carpenters. It's become MUCH harder to stand out- that's for sure. But it's also become a lot easier to seek funding, and as a direct consequence much easier to start.  So while it's much easier to get started as an entrepreneur now it's also much harder to make it big.  I think we both know how hard it is to become an artist today, and while I have no data to back it up I strongly suspect it's because of the crazy high supply of people who want to do artistry for money since it's fun for them. Almost everyone knows one art or another.  In general I've observed that in times when one ""strategy"" or ""path"" is emphasized it becomes easier to enter said path in life, but much much harder to succeed in it. The opposite applies when the strategy/path is not as popular.  I won't really talk that much more about it since I am not a political scientist and can only speak from my (relatively extensive) research and personal observations, and if I kept talking I would inevitably end up saying things which I feel are true but are perhaps not as close to the core of the research I've read as might be desirable and as such could be incorrect.   Overall, I think the world has been doing ""okay"".   Funnily enough I think the points where we disagree comes from us being on different ""paths"". Because I've been shaped by my passions I am an opportunist by nature and as a result any world which is not absolute garbage in every single way is a world in which I can be very happy. There are always opportunities.  I'm sure a lot of people would consider what I do money-grubbing and being overly focused on finances, but it's genuinely what I love doing so I'll continue doing it for as long as I possibly can and will keep trying to become a better person every day.  I hope anyone and everyone spends time working out what they find important in life and how to optimize to get the most out of their lives. It's literally the best thing I've ever done, even if working out your ""path"" is a lot of really hard work and you can NEVER be certain that you've found the solution.  Anyway.. thanks a lot for the interesting discussion! I am still incredibly tired and likely make no sense so I will go sleep now so I can keep making sense. You seem like an interesting individual however so if you want to keep discussing or if you ever want anyone to bounce ideas off of to benefit from multiple differing viewpoints covering the same issue then feel free to PM me and we can do it there or on Skype or something.

I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject — which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.  Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.  I trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and   remain yours faithfully,  J. R. R. Tolkien   And, in his correspondence to a friend of his, regarding the above mentioned letter:    I must say the enclosed letter from Rütten & Loening is a bit stiff. Do I suffer this impertinence because of the possession of a German name, or do their lunatic laws require a certificate of arisch origin from all persons of all countries?  Personally, I should be inclined to refuse to give any Bestätigung (although it happens that I can), and let a German translation go hang. In any case I should object strongly to any such declaration appearing in print. I do not regard the (probable) absence of all Jewish blood as necessarily honourable; and I have many Jewish friends, and should regret giving any colour to the notion that I subscribed to the wholly pernicious and unscientific race-doctrine.  You are primarily concerned, and I cannot jeopardize the chance of a German publication without your approval. So I submit two drafts of possible answers."

QuotesPorn,39lxlr,Zain88,30,Fri Jun 12 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"Say what you want but my shelf is comprised mostly of Jung and post Jungians. None of it reflects the watered down dribble that young doctoral candidates pump out.   With that being said i approach Jung's work as an art form - within his work are the remnants of mythology, dreams, symbols, metaphor, religion, gender equality and art.  I've read the self help books you mentioned in my youth and i gotta say - deepok doesn't have shit on John Weir Perry or Robert L Moore."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,daturapiss,-14,Fri Jun 12 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"I think what's important to take note is that you're treating his work like it's literature, rather than it's actual psychology. As long as you're doing that... I guess feel free to do whatever you want, but that's not how it's treated in the outside world. People treat Jung like he's some sort of insightful psychological genius-- when in reality he's just a new-age hippie-bullshit version of Freud, and it's frustrating to see that perpetuated."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,Zain88,26,Fri Jun 12 22:28:40 2015 UTC,"You gotta remember how much of a void stands between Jung and Freud. And i understand this hatred for hippies bruh, i've done my exploring, i've taken shrooms and hash. I've read the mckenna's and the burrough's and what have you.  And time and time again i stand by in silent hatred for the hippies even though they're supposed to be for the same shit i am for. You know? I'm all for equality and caring but the moment you shut off anger and hatred you shut off courage and strength.  And these goddamned hippies - so dogmatic, which is ironic seeing how i'm speaking - but they wall themselves up in castles of ''feels'' and ignore the bad.  I think that's what i learned from Jung - enantiodromia. We gotta be complete to function properly.  Back to the difference between frued and Jung - one main point, aside from assigning all things to sexual urges (Jung thought that their was some truth there but he also thought that there was more ''energy'' there that was asexual more so than repression) - was that Jung was furiously opposed to his work becoming a dogma.  That's one of the reasons they split - Freud said that Jung would become his heir, remember freud was a good fifteen/thirty years older than Jung.   Frued believed that this shit would become a staple, a dogma.  And if you spent some times with that first generation of post Jungians you'd see how much the thought, the theories have evolved. Campbell wasn't a psychologist but a scholar and was very much in tune with the Jungian thought system and we can see just how spot on he was with his main theory - it's seen everywhere today in modern cinema.  There's truth within Jungian thought - but it reaches so far into other disciplines that you can't really respect it as one singular force. Jack of all trades, master of none.   If you get into this shit you're going to learn some things about myth, religion, dreams, literature, and in some ways, medicine - but it's so fucking spaced out that you can't really ever hope to become a great enough of a magi or wise man to learn all of it.  In many ways - that's the reason I respect it so much. We live in a global community - there's no doubt about that.  I'm speaking to you from bumfuck south dakota, god knows where you're from.  We all have our own myths, whether we respect them or not, they are there, they live. Its like these crazy fucking rivers that run far below the earth and further still, the warm center that keeps this earth spinning.   There's unity.  But you know - it ain't epigenetics or anything CATscan related.  That's one of the main reasons why i never got into modern psychology - i don't much care for knowing what frontal lobes do and what not. I've always treated this hobby as my own form of being a medicine man.   See - i'm a native, and we don't have a culture anymore despite the stereotypes and i've found great comfort and wonder in those stacks of books. Juxtapose those ideas with real world experience and you get a sense of humility that would have otherwise escaped me in my youthful follies."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,daturapiss,4,Fri Jun 12 22:53:34 2015 UTC,Jung was furiously opposed to his work becoming a dogma.   Have you read Erich Fromm?

QuotesPorn,39lxlr,daturapiss,6,Fri Jun 12 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"""To Have or to Be?"", ""Sane Society"" and ""The Art of Loving"" are very good for example IMHO.  I cherish him mostly because he really opened my eyes to the extremely pervasive confusion of symbols and things, e.g.:   The whole concept of alienation found its first expression in Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry. The essence of what the prophets call ""idolatry"" is not that man worships many gods instead of only one. It is that the idols are the work of man's own hands -- they are things, and man bows down and worships things; worships that which he has created himself. In doing so he transforms himself into a thing. He transfers to the things of his creation the attributes of his own life, and instead of experiencing himself as the creating person, he is in touch with himself only by the worship of the idol. He has become estranged from his own life forces, from the wealth of his own potentialities, and is in touch with himself only in the indirect way of submission to life frozen in the idols. The deadness and emptiness of the idol is expressed in the Old Testament: ""Eyes they have and they do not see, ears they have and they do not hear,"" etc. The more man transfers his own powers to the idols, the poorer he himself becomes, and the more dependent on the idols, so that they permit him to redeem a small part of what was originally his. The idols can be a godlike figure, the state, the church, a person, possessions. Idolatry changes its objects; it is by no means to be found only in those forms in which the idol has a so-called religious meaning. Idolatry is always the worship of something into which man has put his own creative powers, and to which he now submits, instead of experiencing himself in his creative act.  Among the many forms of alienation, the most frequent one is alienation in language. If I express a feeling with a word, let us say, if I say ""I love you,"" the word is meant to be an indication of the reality which exists within myself, the power of my loving. The word ""love"" is meant to be a symbol of the fact love, but as soon as it is spoken it tends to assume a life of its own, it becomes a reality. I am under the illusion that the saying of the word is the equivalent of the experience, and soon I say the word and feel nothing, except the thought of love which the word expresses. The alienation of language shows the whole complexity of alienation. Language is one of the most precious human achievements; to avoid alienation by not speaking would be foolish -- yet one must be always aware of the danger of the spoken word, that it threatens to substitute itself for the living experience. The same holds true for all other achievements of man; ideas, art, any kind of man-made objects. They are man's creations; they are valuable aids for life, yet each one of them is also a trap, a temptation to confuse life with things, experience with artifacts, feeling with surrender and submission. -- Erich Fromm, ""Marx's Concept of Man""   And I like how he considers war and slavery inventions, not some innate thing humans just do, as people in militaristic societies are lead to believe.   [Humans] have been genetically programmed through hunting behavior: cooperation and sharing. Cooperation between members of the same band was a practical necessity for most hunting societies; so was the sharing of food. Since meat is perishable in most climates except that of the Arctic, it could not be preserved. Luck in hunting was not equally divided among all hunters; hence the practical outcome was that those who had luck today would share their food with those who would be lucky tomorrow. Assuming hunting behavior led to genetic changes, the conclusion would be that modern man has an innate impulse for cooperation and sharing, rather than for killing and cruelty. -- Erich Fromm, ""The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness""   Here's another one of those things that I think are true, and maybe obvious, but also easily forgotten and always worth repeating:   [..] if one is in touch with one's own unconscious reality, I think one would have to admit that in all of us there is a piece of Eichmann, and if you ask why, on what basis do I say this, then I would ask you wether you have lost your appetite when you read that in India people were starving, or wether you have gone on eating. As soon as you have not lost your appetite, when you knew other people were starving, then your heart has hardened, and in principle, you have done the same which Eichmann did.  I don't think, that if we are really in touch with the inner reality of ourselves, that there is any crime, or perhaps any virtue, which we cannot discover in ourselves. We shut ourselves [off] from the awareness of our inner reality, we project the evil to our opponents and enemies, and believe that the good is in ourselves; indidivually, nationally, and group-wise in general.  But if you can really see that every one of us, carries all of humanity, the good and the evil, within himself, then indeed is very hard to be a fanatic, then indeed it's very hard to be a judge, then indeed would follow, a deep understanding, if not love, of your fellow man. Which is part of being truly a person. -- Erich Fromm, lecture called ""The Automaton Citizen""   Alright, I'm done advertising :)"

QuotesPorn,39lxlr,jwlm,10,Sat Jun 13 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure where you're getting this from. Jung had a huge influence on the psychiatric movement, and in my opinion (currently researching in cognitive science), his model of the unconscious far surpassed Freud's."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,Zain88,-4,Fri Jun 12 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"As far as depth and attempting to understand what he thought was the ""unconscious human psyche"" he definitely did better work that Freud, I'm just of the opinion through the work I've done and stuff that I've read that all talk of ""the unconscious"" is just a huge waste of time and resources, and it mainly is just born from bad psychological and folk-philosophical prejudice."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,jwlm,10,Fri Jun 12 22:38:51 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that there's probably a lot of rubbish talked about the unconscious! However, the idea itself - of something existing that is both mental and not present consciously - is perfectly fine, a useful description and very intuitive. For instance, we wouldn't want to say we are consciously aware of all our memories all the time (or even some of them any of the time), but we would want to say that they're mental (they exist in the mind): unconscious seems an good description of them."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,Zain88,-1,Fri Jun 12 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. What you're talking about though, is absolutely NOT what 99% of the population is when they talk about the unconscious. That's why in cog sci we typically don't use phrases like ""unconscious vs conscious"" we talk about things like ""hot cognition vs cold cognition"" or some other way in which of talking about mental states that don't bring up this problematic language.   Obviously it's just a problem with the way the words have been used in the past, but I'm one of those on that bandawgon-- I hate the connotation that ""the unconscious"" has gotten presicely BECAUSE of Freud and Jung, so I do my best not to use that phrase, because it brings with it all this bullshit pscyho-babble talk that's been embedded in the practice of psychology and folk-psychology."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,kiwifuel,2,Fri Jun 12 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"Does a lot of depth psychology sound like woo woo horseshit? Yes, but it's an effective tool.  Cognitive science and psychotherapy/depth psychology serve two entirely different purposes and have two entirely different approaches.   Depth psychology is an intuitive and pragmatic formulation. The mind is a complex system, and fields like cognitive science are creating an objective way of understanding the brain. However, in treating things like trauma, anxiety, personal development, etc, cognitive science can only do so much for now. We have to rely on a different sort of model for therapists to be able to effectively treat patients.  The problem you seem to have with Jung and Freud seems to be in the domain of semantics."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,jwlm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:26:28 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I can see how ""the unconscious"" and ""unconscious mental objects (etc.)"" could have very different connotations: the former being the somewhat mysterious entity appealed to by psychodynamics; the latter referring, perhaps, more to automatic processing, stored information, etc. I have, however, encountered a lot of talk of ""unconscious vs conscious"" is cog sci literature. But not, admittedly ""the unconscious vs the conscious""."

The British Medical Journal    However, this article attributes the quote to Freud, which is probably not correct. There is quite a controversy about who originally said it, but Jung seems to be the top contender: http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/07/08/sane-cure/    “Show me a sane man and I will cure him for you.” Translated into other terms it now became “Show me a great man and I will dismantle him for you.”   The Guardian newspaper    There are various other attempts at interpretation in the link I posted. So it seems that there is no consensus as to what this quote actually means."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,bobbyfiend,4,Sat Jun 13 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"I can give you a very general context (whether he actually said it or not): Jung was psychoanalysis's mystical spirit-wanderer or something--and this is one reason he and Freud split. Jung believed in some very bizarre (but very cool) stuff, like the collective unconscious and synchronicity. Given his general approach to things--nonlinear, nontraditionally structured (or unstructured), intuitive--it makes perfect sense that he would have questioned the necessity and even the desirability of culturally-formulated (or, worse, psychiatrically-formulated) conceptualizations of sanity.  Maybe he was a bit like Timothy Leary, but a few decades earlier."
QuotesPorn,39lxlr,kiwifuel,2,Sat Jun 13 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure Jung said this. Regardless...  The implication would be that sane means a sort of stagnant ordinary personality and lack of individuality, and that every individual needs to grow according to their own unique nature."

QuotesPorn,39hz39,clementine_zest,38,Fri Jun 12 01:37:46 2015 UTC,The data tends to trend where you're looking.
QuotesPorn,39hz39,DrConrad007,15,Fri Jun 12 02:48:53 2015 UTC,That statement doesn't mean anything with respect to quantum physics. Maybe shitty statistics.
QuotesPorn,39hz39,golden_boy,16,Fri Jun 12 06:28:13 2015 UTC,The act of observing an electron forces it from a probability cloud into one of several possible eigenstates. So yes for this example you don't get the eigenstates if you're not actually looking. Quantum is weird and non-intuitive.
QuotesPorn,39hz39,Palpatime,-3,Fri Jun 12 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"That's not true. You know it has to be one of those eigenstates, and you cant can't just look for a subset of eigenstates. Where you look has no relevance to the outcome. It's just that outcomes occur at the time of measurement. I also dislike that you make a vacuous statement implying i don't know what I'm talking about."

Whether or not this is a completely accurate description of the effect is up for debate by people with more knowledge of the subject than me.

QuotesPorn,39enpb,be_the_foreskin,131,Thu Jun 11 23:50:37 2015 UTC,"The full quote for context:   Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.  There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.   – Guerilla Open Access Manifesto (July 2008).  And because he was a pretty cool dude, have some more to digest:   Geeks seem a lot more willing to treat people based on what they can do rather than who they are. This isn’t unique to kids, of course. The Internet has an amazingly liberating aspect for everyone from blacks to the blind. So perhaps that’s one reason why I’m especially concerned about draconian proposals for an “Internet Drivers License” or a crackdown on anonymity. Quite aside from the impracticality and ineffectiveness of these proposals, they could have the effect of tagging who people are, and reintroducing those indicators that the Internet has removed.      On the one hand, I want to be very open about everything, On the other, I heavily defend people’s right to privacy.      Think deeply about things. Don’t just go along because that’s the way things are or that’s what your friends say. Consider the effects, consider the alternatives, but most importantly, just think."

QuotesPorn,39enpb,nuocmam,98,Thu Jun 11 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"..Okay, I just got up so I'm confused. Is this supposed to be relevant to /r/fatpeoplehate being banned for harassment? Are you saying that hate speech is ""information""? Or is this a slippery slope argument, like ""if they can ban things for hate speech harassment then they'll also ban ideologies they don't like""?  Edit: Reddit's policy isn't actually based on whether something is hate speech, it's based on whether subreddits ""allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action."" (source)(definition of harassment here)(evidence) A further comment says they're talking about ""men and women whose lives are being affected and worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day."" So the policy is about that behavior, not content. My question is still whether the argument is that disallowing this behavior will lead to disallowing information."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,59,Thu Jun 11 11:25:20 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that once you cross the line from ""nothing illegal"" to ""nothing offensive,"" you've made it subjective to the opinions of people in charge."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,simjanes2k,22,Thu Jun 11 12:07:12 2015 UTC,Except the difference here is what /r/fatpeoplehate did wasn't subjective at all. Harassing other people because of their weight is wrong 100% of the time.

QuotesPorn,39enpb,Major_Ocelot,0,Thu Jun 11 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that research. Could someone who is likely to self-report experiencing ""weight discrimination"" be more likely to attain/retain obesity because they believe being fat is okay (or perhaps more importantly, that it's out of their control), therefore by being treated differently they are experiencing something akin to the discrimination of minority race groups? If this is the case, I wonder is fat shaming even going to make a difference? Would people dancing around this person's feelings and being very careful never to mention their weight be any more likely to result in them losing weight?  As a non-obese person, if someone pointed out that I had put on a bit of weight, or suggested I need to lose it, I would agree with them. It might not be pleasant to hear and maybe I wouldn't react positively in that moment, but I wouldn't consider it ""weight discrimination"". Believing you are being unfairly discriminated against for something outside of your control because you are fat is the kind of behaviour that the deceased subreddit would shame people for, and I'm sure many of us believe such attitudes should be condemned (as opposed to just shaming people for simply being fat - which I'm aware was also a big part of that subreddit).  Part of the reason I'm sceptical about this research is that I've noticed a difference in certain Asian cultures specifically regarding the way they talk about being fat. It seems common for Asian parents for example to be very blunt in telling their kids they are fat or getting fat, and outside of parental relationships it seems common for people in peer groups to point out each other's (or their own) weight without a stigma. And of course, obesity rates are much lower in Asia. Of course, this is anecdotal and the lower obesity could have genetic factors or be because Asian countries don't have the same culture of abundance and overindulgence that we have in the west, but in Asian cultures where obesity is so much more rare I think it's certainly fair to assume obesity is at least as stigmatised as it is in the west, if not even moreso, and it doesn't seem to be leading to increased obesity."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,TitoTheMidget,0,Thu Jun 11 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you this as a dude who's struggled with weight control. I'm not obese, but I've been overweight on and off and I've straddled that line of obesity once or twice. I can usually catch myself before I go off the deep end and reign myself in, but I'm familiar with the struggle. That hasn't always been the case - I was a fat kid. I started getting chunky in elementary school, got straight-up fat in middle school, and didn't start losing weight until late high school. I'm 25 now, and I'm in the process of slimming down. I'm watching what I eat more carefully, I'm getting more exercise, and I'm starting to see results, slowly.  I can only speak for myself here, but I am much more likely to change my eating habits when someone says ""Hey man, you're putting on a little weight, I'm concerned about you"" as opposed to the shit FPH spews out. If it's approached with concern, I usually think ""They're right, I could stand to lose a few pounds, better get back on the bike.""  I heard a lot of FPH-type comments in school, and as much as they talk about ""fee fees,"" that shit does dig deep. But here's the thing, when someone said those kinds of things to me, my reaction wasn't ""Man, they're right, I need to lose some weight."" It just made me feel bad about myself. And I know the next step in FPH-logic is to say ""Yeah, you feel bad about yourself, then you change yourself,"" but that's not what happened. Far more often, instead of thinking ""Maybe I shouldn't eat the cookie,"" I thought ""Fuck it, I'm already fat, I'm gonna eat the cookie."" That's the effect that fat shaming had on me, and according to this research it's not all that uncommon. I wouldn't at all be surprised if it were true, both because of my experience and because it's a well-known psychological phenomenon known as the ""backfire effect."" It wasn't until I got older and people stopped being such assholes about someone who had a heavier body than them that I took the approach of ""Hmm, I could lose a few pounds.""  I'm able to regulate myself pretty well now. But the thing people that have never had to lose a lot of weight don't get is that eating habits are not so easy to change. I know how to cook healthy food, and I enjoy cooking, and I like eating healthy food as well. Cooking is not hard to me, and fast food has never been my vice as far as unhealthy eating. I feel better when I eat a healthier diet, both physically and emotionally. But there's a constant voice in my head saying ""Eat the potato chips. Drink the Coke. Ohh, ice cream. Just a little bit won't hurt."" Most of the time I'm able to ignore it. Sometimes it turns into a voice screaming in my head, and it's not so easy to ignore. I've found cheat days to be a necessary part of my healthier eating habits. Yeah, I'd rather just not eat junk food at all, but if I don't have a day where I allow myself to have some small amount, I'll always end up binging after a long time of not having any. ""Just a little bit won't hurt"" always turns into ""Fuck it, eat more, you earned it"" which eventually just turns into bad eating habits again. I've never had a comment from FPH set off that chain reaction that leads to ""Fuck it, eat up fatty"" in my head, but I could definitely see how it could happen to someone else. I guarantee you that none percent of the posters to FPH would say some of the vile shit they say on this website in person. Deep down, they all know that it's not helping, that it's making the problem worse."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,Major_Ocelot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that giving someone criticism that comes from a kind, concerned place is more effective than being a dick about it. While I've never experienced the desire to eat in response to feelings of depression or anxiety, I've certainly found myself resisting other people's attempts to get me to change my behaviour in ways that I logically know I should, just because of the manner in which they confronted me about it. If you approach people in the wrong way they'll just get defensive and stubbornly continue the bad behaviours (which sounds a bit like this ""backfire effect"" you mentioned).  However, this is something that stuck out in the article you linked:   If stigmatizing isn’t the way to fight obesity, what about the effect of naming obesity a “disease,” as the American Medical Association did last month? It’s too early to tell, Puhl says, but she has a good feeling about it. “I think time will tell. I think that there is reason to think it will be helpful -- that this could potentially reduce stigma because it may help remove blame that is so often put on people,” Puhl says. “But I think we need to observe this over time to see what happens.”   This is really the part that I (and I'm sure many others) have a problem with. While I will concede to you that fat shaming is not likely to help people solve their weight issues, I think it's very important that people recognise that they are solely responsible for them and not to shift blame. Calling obesity a ""disease"" for example only sends a message that an obese person's eating is outside of their own control, and if someone truly believes this, they will obviously have no reason to change their habits.  While I don't agree with throwing vitriol at fat people, is a public health campaign like the one mentioned in your linked article -   A 2011 public health campaign in Georgia used that idea in a series of ads designed to fight childhood obesity, featuring chubby, sad-looking kids with slogans like “Big bones didn’t make me this way. Big meals did.”   - really ""fat shaming""? I think there is a difference between abusive comments towards fat people and trying to fight misinformation about the very core of the issue which is that obesity is caused by overeating."

I'm not sure I can define free speech, but it surely is not hundreds of people shouting one person down. To me speech implies saying something, not just hurling insults as a group against minorities or individuals. If people can't say what they want to say 1 on 1, that is, if they need sophistry and their mob to do it, it's no more speech to me than going ghgrgahghrghar would be.   It's not a free speech issue to me anyway. This isn't the government taking down a website, and while the decision by reddit may be hypocritical in some respects, or driven by whatever motives, I just happen to find it neat in this case, mostly because of the reaction: so it's not about harrassment or being 12 year olds... but now reddit is plastered in attacks on the CEO, everybody cries about the ""SWJ agenda"" and so on. I really hope this gets recorded and datamined for years to come. It sure is something to behold.  Imagine people flipping out that way when myspace made profiles less customizable or something, or when they deleted the forums altogether.. or hey, people bitch about slashdot changes, but never quite in this way.

QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,7,Thu Jun 11 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"Edit from later: Again, the actual reddit policy is against harassment, not hate speech. Both are separate concepts from ""nothing offensive,"" and actions of harassment are not as subjective as offensiveness, so that point still stands. But the discussion of hate speech here is not as relevant.  I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of the banning hate speech, then. It's not because it's ""offensive"" or because someone's feelings were hurt by a criticism (if that were the criteria, we couldn't have any open political discussions), it's because it's an attack against someone else's basic humanity. Now, we can have all sorts of discussions about how to handle such issues and be sure that the authority figures have ways of differentiating and figure out whether this was such a case, but it is certainly a different thing than just whether something is offensive."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,simjanes2k,5,Thu Jun 11 13:38:49 2015 UTC,You're right.  Then it's offensive with a logical fallacy.  That... changes literally nothing.
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,0,Thu Jun 11 14:31:37 2015 UTC,"It does still involve a judgement call by people in authority, so you're right that it's still important to be careful of what powers they have. I wasn't responding to that point directly. I was pointing out that the issue of offensiveness is not the same thing as the issue of hate speech, and I hope that important distinction helps explain the events and the reason people don't think it can bleed over as easily into prevention of criticism. You posted another comment asking whether you're allowed to make fun of Bill Gates, and I think if the rule is against hate speech the answer is clearly yes, since Bill Gates is not a demographic of people being attacked, and making fun of someone isn't the same thing as harassment or hate speech anyway."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,ginbooth,2,Thu Jun 11 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"I was pointing out that the issue of offensiveness is not the same thing as the issue of hate speech   This is incredibly arbitrary and awfully convenient for those in authority.  Look at anti-terror laws, especially in despotic countries.  Someone's actively dissenting?  No they're not, they're 'terrorizing' us."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Well, as I noted in my earlier comments, it turns out this isn't the actual distinction they're drawing. The rule is about the behavior of harassment going beyond the subreddit, not about hate speech or offensiveness at all.  But I still don't really think the difference is as fuzzy as so many people seem to think.. I know people who are offended by political stances about science, but it's clearly not hate speech. You can get offended by all sorts of cursing and sin and disturbing behavior. You can even be offended by a bunch of very personal insults or criticisms of groups that you're in without thinking it could possibly be hate speech. You can be offended by people who say your religion or creed or political stance are fundamentally based on flawed concepts and will inevitably lead you to suffering without it being hate speech.  Hate speech is pretty specific, sometimes doesn't involve anyone being offended, and only overlaps with a tiny portion of everything people get offended over. There are variations in the definition, but it's generally just when you attack or threaten a person or group on the basis of demographics or certain stereotypes.  So I think the issue itself is distinct from the concept of merely ""offensive"" in a non-arbitrary way. But maybe you're just talking about enforcement when you say ""this is incredibly arbitrary."" I agree that there are many ways in which organizations and governments try to bend issues into other issues. I don't think that should stop anyone from ever trying to make rules, though. I mean, presumably reddit is anti-terrorism and doesn't allow you to conduct terrorism plots. But reddit also is clearly allowing of active dissent in all sorts of ways, unless it involves threatening individuals or breaks other rules. So obviously it is possible for rules to be about one thing without also taking out the other. Since I'm assuming we agree that reddit can be against using the site for terrorism without also being against using the site for active dissent, your example sorta reflects my point that it's possible to be against something really damaging without being against something related but benign. If you're in favor of a total anarchist system, though, then that's a whole other discussion."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,ginbooth,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that there are many ways in which organizations and governments try to bend issues into other issues.   I appreciate your response, but this is the crux of the issue.  What one considers offensive and what one considers hate speech is rooted in context and popular opinion.  If one shouts 'sieg heil!' in a synagogue is that offensive or is that hate speech?  From a legal perspective hate speech is more easily defined when followed by some kind of action.  If one's wears a swastika in public it may illicit a public outcry, but if one places a cross in a jar of urine it might be considered art.   Rules are absolutely necessary, but the current ethical climate is governed by a rule set predicated on feelings and individual interpretation rather than some kind of objective value.  Take, for instance, this piece in a decidedly liberal news site.  What occurred here on reddit seems to echo this growing trend down a very treacherous, though well-trodden path if history is any indication."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:14:22 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree with your point about the concept in general, as you see in the part of my comment you quoted. I think pretty much everyone agrees that there is danger inherent in allowing authority figures to block things based on any sort of even slightly subjective judgement call. If that's all you're saying, we can just agree and end this discussion.  The point I was making is that yes, there is danger in authority figures making judgements, but that needs to be balanced against the advantage of authority figures making judgements. It sounded like you were against Reddit's policy specifically, whereas now you seem to be making a more general statement about ""the current ethical climate"" that reddit ""seems to echo."" The two might not be the same, since it might be true that the current ethical climate is too stifling without the current reddit policy also being so. Which statement are you making?"
QuotesPorn,39enpb,ginbooth,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Neither.  I think the policy was applied in a capricious manner given that other subreddits exhibited similar or worse behavior.  That caprice seems quite indicative of the current, dangerous ethical climate championing feelings and individual feelings to the point of censorship.  Often what feelings or interpretations are valued is simply based on what may be popular or in vogue.  Again though, that was a ridiculous subreddit.  I'm not defending its value."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,simjanes2k,-2,Thu Jun 11 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see a major distinction between offensive speech and hate speech, except the target.  Your argument, I take it, is that the distinction of being a rich white man or a poor black woman is enough to affect how we should treat them?  And that is how the Reddit rules should be interpreted and enforced?"
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,5,Fri Jun 12 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was about whether Bill Gates is or isn't in a certain demographic, I said it's because, as an individual, Bill Gates ""is not a demographic."" There's a difference between an individual being attacked and a demographic being attacked, which is what I was basing my argument on.  If you're not clear on what hate speech is, you might want to look up various scholarly/common usage/legal definitions, because there are a lot of specific markers that have been debated by courts for decades, and most of them revolve around whether the attack is based on someone belonging to a certain demographic rather than on them in particular. There have been many cases of people proving that someone said something about them that they took offense at, but being unable to prove that it was hate speech and therefore losing the case (whether the target is offended generally isn't relevant to trials about hate speech). Hopefully that's reassuring to you and whoever else is concerned that there might not be a difference.  Again, I respect your point about authority figures making judgements, I'm just talking about the fact that the concept of hate speech exists and isn't the same thing as the concepts of offensiveness that you may be more familiar with.  Edit: In terms of this case, though, they're talking about harassment rather than hate speech, so this isn't super relevant. More to the point, harassment isn't the same thing as offensiveness, and in many cases it's much easier to draw that distinction than it is between offensiveness and hate speech."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,simjanes2k,2,Fri Jun 12 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm familiar with the legal definitions of hate speech, nebulous and ever-changing as they may be.    Much like free speech arguments though, the legal definition of hate speech has no bearing on the actions of a company except as they decide to enforce their version of it.  Meaning then,   Or is this a slippery slope argument, like ""if they can ban things for literal hate speech then they'll also ban ideologies they don't like""?   the answer to this is, they are meaningfully indistinguishable.  The arguments can only be made on merit, not legal precedent.   edit:  I like talking to you.  Too many one-and-done soundbyte monkeys out today about this stuff."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not saying it has legal bearing on the actions of a company, I was just concerned because I thought your summary of the new policy as ""nothing offensive"" was lacking.  As it turns out, just-having-gotten-up me was incorrect about the classification they're using: It's not actually about whether something is hate speech, it's about whether it's a sustained culture of harassment. Reddit still allows hate speech, it just doesn't allow the behavior of harassment, however they define it. In their words, We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.  So I guess I would edit my post if I wanted to improve its accuracy. The question should have been, 'Or is this a slippery slope argument, like ""if they can ban things for harassment then they'll also ban ideologies they don't like""?'  This is an easier distinction to make, since their definition of harassment can involve specific actions and can therefore be somewhat independent of content. It's still not easy, but I think it's a little easier than trying to figure out what is and isn't hate speech.  Edit: Actually, the real test that people should be using is seeing whether a subreddit devoted to harassing people for something totally unrelated to established social justice demographics gets banned. Like, if /r/PCMasterRace were all about going and harassing console gamers throughout both reddit and other social media sites."

QuotesPorn,39enpb,billtheangrybeaver,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"I like GTAV example, no one from FPH must play GTAV therefore these comments are brigading from FPH. I see a lot of anti fat comments in all subs, were all those FPH brigades too? As far as the makeupaddiction one, I remember that one. It was nothing that /r/SRS, /r/justneckbeardtings, /r/trashy, /r/badtattoos,/r/imgoingtohellforthis etc doesn't do. Doesn't matter though, what's done is done and other subs that do nothing different will continue doing the same."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think every example is clear-cut, but it sure looks like FPH went all over suicidewatch, since they don't usually do this to people https://i.imgur.com/A6ORPlL.png  And, when a non-subscriber asked them to take down the thread about her picture from /r/sewing, they responded by putting that picture in the sidebar, which is obviously something the mod team did and not some random individual https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/341wlr/redditor_from_rsewing_posts_pictures_of_herself/  So yeah, there are definitely some examples that aren't clear and might've been perturbations of fat-hate from the rest of reddit, but there are also definitely examples of FPH supporting the harassment of people beyond their subreddit."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,billtheangrybeaver,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:29:53 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure there are a lot of members that went too far and took it outside the sub.

That said it's kind of shitty to punish entire subs and mods for actions of a few they can't control especially when it's ignored elsewhere.
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,2,Thu Jun 11 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I would get that if it were the actions of a few outliers. My point with the /r/sewing example, and the point, as far as I can tell, of the admins, was that the moderators themselves were on board with it."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,billtheangrybeaver,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"Granted, but that was still inside FPH wasn't it? Dick move yes, but I fail to see why that would be ban worthy. When someone puts pics of themselves on the internet they accept the possibility of other use."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,InfiniteImagination,2,Thu Jun 11 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Your comment was:   Irony is, FPH members were the ones getting threatened. Granted they did shadowban one for the threats but why weren't her subs banned? Where's the proof that anyone from outside FPH was being threatened?   which I think the suicidewatch post pretty much answers. Then your second point was that it was just a few members and not mods, which the sewing example pretty much answers. So I guess now your point is ""yes, they threaten/harass people outside the subreddit, and yes the moderators condone and encourage harassment, but at least we don't have proof they do both at once""? And also that when people put a picture of themselves on the internet that they ""accept"" rather than holding any possibility of objecting to being called ""fuck ugly,"" ""fucking atrocious,"" ""fucking awful,"" ""fatty,"" ""ya fat cunt,"" having people say ""I kind of want to shoot it.""? (from the archive of the thread) I would understand if you had said that they know of the possibility, but I hardly think they should accept it."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,billtheangrybeaver,0,Thu Jun 11 22:53:52 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, I can go over to /r/imgoingtohellforthis, make a few posts then go to some other sub and harass people. Just because some people were making comments related to being fat in the suicide post doesn't necessarily mean it was members of FPH. There are trolls and people with the same sentiment that weren't subbed. Even if it was, mods and others in a group can't control everything every member does elsewhere. If that logic applied then why weren't all the subs banned that had members brigade FPH constantly? The situation is entirely focused on one group."

QuotesPorn,39enpb,Dr_Prof_Doom,17,Fri Jun 12 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"Except it isn't really hypocrisy isn't it?   On Reddit, you're allowed to discuss your opinion no matter how controversial they may be. But the minute you start forcing your opinions on other people who don't want to be involved (e.g /r/FatPeopleHate and them harassing fat people), you've broken Reddit's rules and now you're getting the ban hammer. /r/Fatpeoplehate was a hub for such harassment, and was helping people harass other redditors. Therefore, it had to go. This isn't about free speech. This is about harassment."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,leif777,10,Thu Jun 11 19:49:19 2015 UTC,Serious question: Shouldn't they have banned the people doing the harassing and not the sub? I know the sub was offencive but there are hundreds of subs like that and some even worse. It doesn't make sense to me.
QuotesPorn,39enpb,Dr_Prof_Doom,-4,Thu Jun 11 06:37:29 2015 UTC,"Well, that was what the Reddit admins were doing, and still are doing with subs that harass, but on a much smaller level (such as SRS). While I do not know Reddit's official reason for why they decided to ban /r/FatPeopleHate and not the other subs, I can only theorize that it is because /r/FatPeopleHate may of acted as a hub for harassment, and therefore by taking it down, reduced the effectiveness of those harassing. Although the Reddit admins has been remarkably quiet on this issue.   EDIT: Typos."

Not the case with other subs. If it's just the users, they get banned - if the sub itself encourages it, the sub gets banned."

QuotesPorn,39enpb,TommyNobility,0,Thu Jun 11 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Nobody there was forcing people to go into their sub. Forcing opinions using an optional subreddit isn't really easy. Nobody there was allowed to link to other parts of Reddit either so idk what this harassment accusation is about

If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate[2] .   I don't know the exact details of how /r/FatPeopleHate allowed people to brigade other people (I obviously don't browse it). But I trust in the honesty of the Reddit admins to have good reason to ban /r/FatPeopleHate."

Not really FPH's fault"
QuotesPorn,39enpb,Dr_Prof_Doom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"TheYellowRose, a mod on /r/OffMyChest said that he had a bot autoban everyone who posted in /r/FatPeopleHate because a lot of people who brigaded /r/OffMyChest were from /r/FatPeopleHate.   Besides, if someone bans you from their sub without any apparent justification, it's not really nice or civilized to begin raiding their subreddit in retaliation (not to forget, /r/OffMyChest is a support subreddit, there are suicidal people posting there).   So in summary, FPH are guilty because they raided /r/OffMyChest, thus encouraging the mods of /r/OffMyChest to set up a bot to auto ban everyone from /r/OffMyChest to prevent them being raided again. You were banned because you associated with a group of people known to attack very vulnerable people. I know, it's messy and a little extreme, but you can't really expect the moderators of /r/OffMyChest to sit around and do nothing knowing that they're going to be raided by a bunch of people they could easily ban in an instant."
QuotesPorn,39enpb,TommyNobility,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yet I never saw a post about raiding off my chest, so how was it organized? Not through FPH sub so the subreddit itself can't be guilty even if the people in it did something wrong"

A lot of people are okay with being fat, perhaps because deluded and they believe in HAES, or perhaps because they're too apathetic to care about the fact that their life is in serious danger, and I don't think these people should be forced into hating themselves if they don't consent to it, we live in the west, and the west is free, people have the right to act ""stupid"" if they want to, personal freedom is one of the greatest things about the west.

And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.    http://www.bartleby.com/36/1/17.html"

QuotesPorn,39b1ge,gizmo1411,9,Wed Jun 10 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Of course there were all manners of gift exchanges and relationships with nations that came into new contact with each other. Europeans weren't the first people to explore the continent. There were all manners of codes and relationships based around encountering new people and cultures on the continent. Just because they weren't written down doesn't mean they didn't exist. All manners of artifacts made their way across the continent, through extensive trading and exploration. There were elaborate ceremonies based around encountering new peoples."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,Jland139,3,Thu Jun 11 01:30:14 2015 UTC,Then I'll clarify. The natives had had no real contingencies for permanent European settlers who would become real and efficient competitors for land and resources.
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,gizmo1411,7,Thu Jun 11 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that when the Europeans first arrived, they weren't just a massive invading horde. Colonization took place over a long period of time with European nations establishing themselves as independent trading polities on the continent, similar to any other nation present. What they did have was guns, which the British, for instance, were willing to trade with the Indigenous population, usually for slaves. The French were largely unwilling, and maintained a trading relationship similar to any other nation present, trading based on the customs of the nations that they interacted with for goods. The presence of European advanced armor and weaponry and the growing demand for slaves had a major impact on this relationship, as slaving nations suddenly burst on the scene (they would have had no reason to exist before the demand driven by Europeans), who were well weaponized and willing to capture entire villages and nations (women and children as well, which was pretty unheard of before the arrival of Europeans and the early formation of what became chattel slavery in the established colonies). The early relationships and interactions between Europeans and the indigenous populations usually coincided with existing ceremonies and practices, as again, encountering new peoples was a relatively common occurrence for various nations. European concepts of property and slavery (which are of course intertwined) and their willingness to renege on trade stipulations was a major factor in the changing of political control on the continent."

The now worn out cliche of ""huh dur white people are the original illegal immigrants"" has zero basis in history and cannot be produced by any analysis of the relevant facts."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,Plutonium_239,18,Thu Jun 11 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"What an incredibly myopic statement. There were many different nations residing within the national borders of what we consider the United States today. There were massive empires in the Mississippi area that centralized resources and had waring parties. Some of these empires did have slaving societies that served the nobility of their given nation, others did not. There were matriarchal regimes that had political wars that were fought by men but  negotiated between women. The slaving done by these nations was often the result of territorial wars and the slaves were most usually captured warriors, and their position of slave was definitely not hereditary and usually not permanent as they were eventually brought within the folds of kin to replace fallen and captured members of the their new society. Political allegiance was often determined by hair style and was thus transient. It wasn't until Europeans arrived with a distinct form of chattel slavery, that resulted in a massive demand for human bodies, that truly slaving nations emerged. These slaving nations achieved political power through trade with the Europeans, giving them captured enemies in exchange for advanced weaponry, further increasing their political clout. Honestly, it was the introduction of a European demand for human bodies that really created massive political upheavals in the North American region and destabilized a number of major nations making colonization easier. There was certainly brutality and slavery within indigenous America, but Europeans were the only ones to create a massive world-wide economic trade system based on the trade of human bodies as means of production (and the complete dehumanization of the slave).There were many different social formations on the land we now consider America with many different concepts of what we might term slavery. Chattel Slavery, however, is distinctly European and this demand and trade was a massive political destabilizer. You can't just say all Native Americans acted this way or that way..."

QuotesPorn,39b1ge,not_a_toad,-12,Thu Jun 11 06:10:35 2015 UTC,"zero basis in history and cannot be produced by any analysis of the relevant facts.    Thank you for making such an easily disprovable statement.  It saved me from having to research countless pieces of proof.  As it is, I only need one.  So here's one:  The Pope declared in 1514 that he was the soverign of all Native Americans and to those who did not comply:   We shall take you and your wives and your children, and shall make slaves of them, and as such shall sell and dispose of them as their Highnesses may command; and we shall take away your goods, and shall do all the harm and damage that we can."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,slothbuddy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:29:21 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the relevance to my original statement. I was pointing out that the over-used and cliched argument of calling the European settlers (of which there were various conflicting groups, not just the Spanish as perhaps you are implying with your quote from the Requerimiento) in the Americas the original ""illegal immigrants"" as a way to shut down criticism of illegal immigration in the modern day nation state of the USA is not in conjunction with an analysis of the facts of the matter.  Native American tribal societies did not have written legal systems or a concept of law which invoked the modern concept of immigration, let alone illegal immigration. As such, European invaders were never at any point considered illegal immigrants by the natives as this concept was introduced by the European invaders along with the idea of a written legal system all together.  Most if not all Native American tribes engaged in constant warfare and enslavement of other Native American tribes and came into the possession of the lands that they were eventually displaced from by the European invaders by the invasion, displacement and enslavement of other native american tribes, meaning that even the retroactive application of the idea of the European invaders being ""illegal immigrants"" also applies to essentially every native american tribe as well.  In conclusion, the retroactive application of the label ""illegal immigrant"" to the European invaders of the Americas is not relevant to any debate about illegal immigration in the modern USA as it has no basis in historical reality, unless, if one is really wishing to stretch it, native american tribes are willing to accept the label being applied to them, which they clearly aren't."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,Plutonium_239,9,Thu Jun 11 01:59:01 2015 UTC,"Native American tribal societies did not have written legal systems or a concept of law   Saying that this is relevant in any meaningful sense is either disingenuous or willfully ignorant.  They clearly lived here.  They're called Native Americans for good reason: they're native to America.  The settlers and conquerors clearly did not.  You don't have to have a written piece of paper (in the European tradition) to show that the (American) land you and your ancestors lived on and improved for thousands of years is yours, any more than you need a birth certificate to show you have a right not to be murdered.   Most if not all Native American tribes engaged in constant warfare and enslavement of other Native American tribes and came into the possession of the lands that they were eventually displaced from by the European invaders by the invasion, displacement and enslavement of other native american tribes, meaning that even the retroactive application of the idea of the European invaders being ""illegal immigrants"" also applies to essentially every native american tribe as well.   This is just good, old fashioned racism.  It's the same shit people say about Africans who were taken and put on slave ships: ""They were enslaving each other!  They're the real barbarians!""  Truth be told everything you just said can and should be said about Europe.  And modern America.  Any pretty much everywhere humans have lived.  So unless you're going to tell me how there's no such thing as national sovereignty because every country is just the most recent conquerors, then it's all bullshit.  When the Europeans got to America, there were nations of established peoples.  The Europeans invaded, conquered, murdered, and enslaved them.  If you are bent on interpreting ""illegal immigration"" as being defined by a strict, legalistic definition, then yes you're going to come to your conclusion.  And you will be completely missing the point."

QuotesPorn,39b1ge,illStudyTomorrow,28,Thu Jun 11 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"Whenever I hear people say that Natives ""belong more"" to America, or ""have more of a say"" in America because their ancestors resided in the territory before it was conquered, I always ask them if they would be down to re-take Constantinople with me. Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans only 50 years before Columbus did his thing. So if you're White and think we should respect the Native claim, then repeat after me: Deus Vult!   Really though, I think the problem is that people are looking at the past with a presentist point of view. They are judging their forefathers on the values of the present that were essentially undiscovered at the time. Europeans were as brutal as any other conquering people or nation, perhaps even a little less. They were unique in that they were more efficient and lucky. But that doesn't make what they did any worse, it just means that we remember more of their actions. It's hypocritical to criticize the European invasion when the only reason you find it immoral is because you've based your opinion on the ideas the Europeans ""discovered"" and proliferated (egalitarianism, equality of man, cultural relativism, nurture versus nature). It's like criticizing your mother for bringing you into this world. The only reason you are even able to criticize is because she brought you into this world, so shut up and eat your cheerios."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,elduderino260,2,Thu Jun 11 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"One can criticize the methods of European colonization without damning all of Western culture or even necessarily condemning the colonists themselves.  Your argument that judging the atrocities perpetrated against Native cultures is not appropriate because notions of egalitarianism, equality, etc. are modern developments could also be applied to absolve any past injustice from slavery (""plantation owners thought that blacks weren't their equals"") to the Holocaust (""Hitler thought he was eliminating lesser humans""), etc."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,MrTinklebottom,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can absolutely be applied to slavery in the 1600s. The French Revolution had not yet happened and Enlightenment values were still in the process of developing. The scientific consensus was that Africans were innately inferior, and Europe still had remnants of the feudal system in certain places. Remember, Europeans were enslaving other Europeans long before Africans. So, yes, you can't really blame a 17th century European for owning slaves, unless he was a particularly knowledgeable European or spent enough time with Africans to know that they are not innately inferior.   But you can't apply it to the holocaust, because by then the values of egalitarianism and equality have already been developed."
QuotesPorn,39b1ge,elduderino260,3,Thu Jun 11 00:48:03 2015 UTC,"First off, this depends entirely only your theory of morality.  Although a moral relativist would tend to agree with you, whereas a moral objectivist would not.    Your ""temporal"" relativism is really a form of cultural relativism.  As I see it, you are arguing that actions must be considered in the mileau of their time, not because the calendar date was different, but because the body of cultural knowledge was different.  I agree.  It is difficult.  Condemnation can be a form of cultural imperialism and wielded against indigenous cultures just as easily as it can be wielded against European cultures.  However, in the same vein, as George Stocking wrote, it can also be a form of ""neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples.""  So where does one draw the line?  I don't see any hypocrisy in condemning actions by modern criteria without necessarily condemning the individuals who performed them.  This seems like something anyone can do.  For example, one can condemn the act of murder without hating the murderer.    However, I go further.  First off, although the concepts of egalitarianism and equality weren't yet part of European civilization/philosophy, that is not to say that they were not common practice elsewhere.  Also, at what point can we say that these values were ""developed?""  By what metric?  Perhaps the bar should be set when the ideals were developed in Europe during the ""Age of Englightenment?""  Or perhaps when they were more broadly disseminated in Europe in the early half of the 18th century?  Or, the argument could be made that human rights were really only agreed upon with their codification POST-WWII.    Even if we only consider the European Enlightenment, then the systematic attacks on Native American peoples and cultures occurred well into the latter half of the 19th and, according to many scholars, 20th centuries.  Sidenote: The same goes for slavery (which continued into the 19th century despite the fact that it was widely criticized and outlawed in other Western nations), institutional racism against blacks (which continued into the latter half of the 20th century), and systemic racism against blacks and other minority groups (which continues to this day). This also does not remove the culpability of individuals and institutions who perpetrated injustices against Native Peoples.  Finally, to say that something was the norm and therefore acceptable overlooks the fact that there were individuals (albeit a minority) who opposed the actions of European conquerors as unjust and cruel, and that many of the ethical justifications made for the treatment of Native peoples were post-hoc and made with intentions that were considered to be ""bad"" even at the time.    Edit: After coincidentally running into a few of your other posts on other subreddits,  I suspect that having a discussion is not going to be productive for either of us.  As such, I'm just going to leave this here."

I can't find any credible estimates of the number of enslaved Native Americans killed as a result of poor conditions and abuses in forced labor camps, plantations, etc...   It's also worth noting that Hitler himself claimed that his studies of US treatment of Native Americans inspired some of his genocidal actions.

For me, personally, I wouldn't do a lot of the jobs illegals fill so quickly because they just don't appeal to me, and I'm not in so dire straits as to need them.  Given the choice between working on a farm all day for, let's say, $12 an hour, to working in retail at minimum wage, I'd choose the retail job.  But then again, I'm not desperate to where I'd work such a labor-heavy job like that; illegals fill those jobs because, even at much less than $12 an hour, it's all they can get, they have many people to feed, and they have a work ethic that drives them to do anything it takes to keep their families fed."

What we can do is actually honor treaties.  Native American tribes ceded vast amounts of land, often in response to violence and coercion, in return for services and protection. However, these promises have not been met.  Tribes were relocated to marginal lands where they could not provide for themselves.  The BIA is perpetually underfunded, so it could not provide the services promised, even if were being administrated effectively.  As a result, reservations are some of the poorest areas in the United States.  This poverty, combined with the loss of the pillars of traditional lifeways (which was in itself a function of US government policy) contributes to much of the obesity, drug abuse, and crime found on reservations.

QuotesPorn,39b1ge,neocelt,0,Wed Jun 10 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"I bet if you asked the bison, they would call you immigrants as well.   North American and European civilizations were established, built up and fought for and by white Europeans. Europe and North America at the moment have enough resources to prevent massive amounts of immigration into their countries but they are lacking the social and political strength to do something about it because of an inefficient government system and an illogical guilt complex imposed on the public by those vocal and self-serving minorities and their childish liberal minded university ""intellectual"" defenders.    Globally, white Europeans are in fact a minority peoples. Europe is one of the smallest continents in the world, with a much smaller population than Africa or Asia who have populations in the multiple billions. And it's not Europe's or North America's fault that uneducated and resource lacking adults in India or sub-saharan Africa have 4-8 children per marriage. It's not Europe or America's responsibility to take in all the poor and downtrodden who refuse to make the necessary sacrifices to fight for, or at least uphold a respectable standard of living for themselves and their children in their own countries. Escaping your country and then running to those who are better off and asking them to give you a piece of what they've worked for and died for and earned is only going to leave you resented and in my opinion, rightfully needing to be refused at the border.   No other country or nation in past history has been able to tolerate such aggressive amounts of foreign migration into its territory and then survive. All semi-successful nations around today have at one point or another had to fight off foreign invasions. What Europe and North America is experiencing today is an unwanted foreign occupation made possible via a self-imposed globally socialist bureaucracy rather than by military force. It's an invasion nonetheless.   The most important equation you need to know when it comes to this topic is this:  Diversity + proximity = war  If Europe and North America can't get its act together and solve this problem legally through deportation and border restrictions, the racial and social problems that have been steadily boiling up will get much worse. Soon you will see ethnic and social conflicts erupting within European countries and neighborhoods similar to those states in the middle east where there is so much diversity in one place, a perpetual state of war is almost inevitable. At the minimum, you will see a sort of balkanization of America and huge losses of territory in Europe. It's already sort of spiraling in that direction.   Once Europe is gone, it will be impossible to get it back in one piece. And America will no longer qualify as a nation since a territory where everyone is an ethnic or racial minority, can't actually be called a nation."

QuotesPorn,39cxkw,ridgy_didge,18,Thu Jun 11 07:40:50 2015 UTC,"You walk into a room. You see a bunch of people surrounding someone. They're calling that person horrible names. They're also passing out flyers around town telling everyone else to show up to this room to make this person feel really really bad about themselves. This group is numerous, aggressive, and loud. The flyers may even include the phone number of that person and their phone is ringing constantly with horrible verbal abuse.  Anyone who tries to tell them to knock if off is mocked. The owner of one room where this mocking occurs tells them to eff off and removes their flyers. That owner suddenly finds their personal contact information included in those flyers advocating people to take a stand against ""censorship"".  You're not witnessing free speech. You're witnessing bullying and harassment. No reasonable person can conclude otherwise. It's verbal assault and need not be tolerated anywhere.  Voltaire was used his sharp wit to skewer people in power who were ACTUALLY OPPRESSING PEOPLE. He was literally brave enough to skewer the royalty and the church and spend time in the Bastille. To even think of comparing his satire to bullying is to show a misunderstanding of what satire is.  Additionally, Voltaire did not say these word, as /u/a9s pointed out it was Evelyn Beatrice Hall.  A better quote for the occasion would be:   On parle toujours mal quand on n'a rien à dire.  One always speaks badly when one has nothing to say.   – ""Commentaires sur Corneille,"" Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire (1827)."

QuotesPorn,39cxkw,MrCharlieBacon,2,Thu Jun 11 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that Reddit is allowed to do this, sure, but should they? They claim they want a free and open platform, ok, so were do you draw the line? And the users of Reddit are informing the admins about their opinions about how the site should be run. That is how a private enterprise runs. Sure, Reddit could ban any subreddit starting with the letter q, and be within their rights. But then the users respond and say that they disagree, they like subreddits starting with the letter q, or they don't want subreddits banned on vague criteria.  In a community, what should be allowed? Personally I find FatPeopleHate repugnant and juvenile. However, one I find the idea of banning an idea, even hating fat people, to be dangerous.  If users are harassing people then ban them, but don't remove the subreddit. Let them fester and stew in their own hate filled bubble.

QuotesPorn,396d1j,budgie0507,23,Tue Jun 9 16:03:54 2015 UTC,I feel stupid for asking but what does this quote mean exactly?
QuotesPorn,396d1j,Hennessyhoney,4,Tue Jun 9 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"Means that we are too caught up in our own heads, thinking about things and living inside our ideas about what the world is   Erich Fromm:   The whole concept of alienation found its first expression in Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry. The essence of what the prophets call ""idolatry"" is not that man worships many gods instead of only one. It is that the idols are the work of man's own hands -- they are things, and man bows down and worships things; worships that which he has created himself. In doing so he transforms himself into a thing. He transfers to the things of his creation the attributes of his own life, and instead of experiencing himself as the creating person, he is in touch with himself only by the worship of the idol. He has become estranged from his own life forces, from the wealth of his own potentialities, and is in touch with himself only in the indirect way of submission to life frozen in the idols. The deadness and emptiness of the idol is expressed in the Old Testament: ""Eyes they have and they do not see, ears they have and they do not hear,"" etc. The more man transfers his own powers to the idols, the poorer he himself becomes, and the more dependent on the idols, so that they permit him to redeem a small part of what was originally his. The idols can be a godlike figure, the state, the church, a person, possessions. Idolatry changes its objects; it is by no means to be found only in those forms in which the idol has a so-called religious meaning. Idolatry is always the worship of something into which man has put his own creative powers, and to which he now submits, instead of experiencing himself in his creative act.  Among the many forms of alienation, the most frequent one is alienation in language. If I express a feeling with a word, let us say, if I say ""I love you,"" the word is meant to be an indication of the reality which exists within myself, the power of my loving. The word ""love"" is meant to be a symbol of the fact love, but as soon as it is spoken it tends to assume a life of its own, it becomes a reality. I am under the illusion that the saying of the word is the equivalent of the experience, and soon I say the word and feel nothing, except the thought of love which the word expresses. The alienation of language shows the whole complexity of alienation. Language is one of the most precious human achievements; to avoid alienation by not speaking would be foolish -- yet one must be always aware of the danger of the spoken word, that it threatens to substitute itself for the living experience. The same holds true for all other achievements of man; ideas, art, any kind of man-made objects. They are man's creations; they are valuable aids for life, yet each one of them is also a trap, a temptation to confuse life with things, experience with artifacts, feeling with surrender and submission."

QuotesPorn,396d1j,elphabaloves,5,Wed Jun 10 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"eh I think often people are watching, and when you sense that you need to embrace that knowledge, instead of resisting it.  For example when I'm attracted to someone, the way I act around them becomes a kind of performance.  And the philosophical part of myself resists performing, and tries to make me act more natural.  But the natural reaction in the first place, is to perform.  So it's easier just to perform, and find freedom in that."

You could go out and join if it looks fun for instance. This quote is saying that your whole life is out there, on the other side of the glass. Go live.

QuotesPorn,391at0,DamnItSeb,14,Mon Jun 8 18:32:45 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated question. The movie is good. Even on its own, the movie is good, but you'll miss all the subtext. The graphic novel is dense, and there's no way the movie could cover all of it. If you read the graphic novel you'll understand the movie better.   That said, the graphic novel itself is a deconstruction of the entire superhero genre, so you almost need to be steeped in comic lore before you read the graphic novel. SO I guess I would do this...  1) Watch the extended director's cut of the movie.   2) Read the graphic novel, possibly several times.   3) Watch the extended director's cut again.   4) Start reading some other comics so you can understand   the ideas the graphic novel was tearing apart.   5) Repeat. ;)"

QuotesPorn,391at0,VeeganZombie,6,Mon Jun 8 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"To each his own I guess... but the key characters themselves are just so much more interesting in the book than in the movie.  Ozy in the movie is your typical Hollywood villain; whereas his actions in the book, while certainly of the ""ends justify the means"" variety, you can see why he thinks the way he does, and thus him butting heads with Rorshach is just so much more interesting.  Wasn't really a fan of most of the movie casting decisions, cept for Rorshach.  But ultimately what killed it for me was how they took out the allegories, and simplified the philosophical questions until you were left with typical hollywood action fare that managed to share the the surface layer shell of the plot of the book.  I wasn't instantly in love with the art style either, but it fit.  And as for the panel layout, it's something you can adjust to.  I'm not a huge reader of Graphic Novels in general, but watchmen the GN is a good yarn, irrespective of format.  EDIT: /u/falconear probably explains the differences between the book and movie than I do.  But yeah, basically for me, the exclusion of the ""subtext"" in the movie version is what killed it for me, because that's precisely WHY I liked the GN."

It is like this: ""then"" is chronological.  ""We will go there, then do that.""  ""Than"" is connective and comparison, like a conjunction.  ""This is greater than that.""  It is akin to ""and"" or ""or"" .. conjunctions.  tl;dr: ""then"" is time-based and ""than"" is a means of comparison.  tl;dr2:  ""Once the train arrives, then we will get on it.""

QuotesPorn,38wiau,xxhamudxx,0,Mon Jun 8 05:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well, it's referred to by normal people as a ""typo.""   Actually, the definition of ""typo"" means the person knew the proper word, but hit the wrong key.  Otherwise, common misunderstandings of word meanings such as ""then"" and ""than"" or ""your"" and ""you're"" or ""its"" vs. ""it's"" are not typos.  They are simple misunderstandings of words.  Google is rife with pages addressing these and explaining which word to use and how.  tl;dr: In the former case, the person hit the wrong key by mistake.  In the latter, the person hit all the right keys, but didn't understand the words.  Edit: or maybe OP knew exactly what he was doing when he replaced ""than"" with ""then"": ""Let's build strong children.  Then when life breaks them, let's fix them with glue."""

I see what you are saying but I think the quote meant that instead of focusing all of our energy on fixing the broken man, and not the cause of the broken man, we should instead fix the cause of the broken man, which you said was society but it could be something else, and therefore we would be making stronger children since the thing that broke the man can no longer break people.

QuotesPorn,38ytvk,nince1985,8,Mon Jun 8 06:54:05 2015 UTC,What's that they say about statistics? Workforce participation is at multi-decade lows. People are giving up rather than even continuing to search. The unemployment rate doesn't capture that. Just one side of it.

QuotesPorn,38ytvk,Shadowlink1142,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:55:07 2015 UTC,"So unemployment is supposed to cover an individual from losing one job until they find another job. It would not include stay at home moms or the disabled or people who 'choose not to work.' There's reason to believe that the last group is growing but it's hard to find real data on it. Supposedly, in my area (SE US), there is a return of manufacturing jobs, but no labor force that can pass drug screening (more prescription/meth than pot, I believe). I'd really like to see those numbers and the recent graduates looking for work. A lot of people from middle class backgrounds have too much pride to ask for assistance and put it on credit instead.

QuotesPorn,38ytvk,pdeluc99,-1,Mon Jun 8 11:54:34 2015 UTC,"I was going to say something similar.  While I agree that middle class creates the demand for goods, thus increasing demand for jobs, the threat of lower profits due to higher taxes discourages employing and can put a higher burden on those who are employed.  The two (higher taxes and middle class demand) are two different things.  Higher taxes don't create incentive for middle class to buy, and middle class demands don't create a need to tax the rich.  This statement is like saying ""there's no need to buy gas guzzling cars because the middle east is rich in oil"".  Both things are true, but they are not causally related."

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,iriemeditation,127,Sat Jun 6 10:34:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, they should be teaching you English, and then teach you how to understand double talk, politicians double talk.   This is very true and important, and here's my problem; they do.  I always hear whinging on reddit about ""first year college professors"" and over-analysing media and stuff.  That's a really, really important skill-set and perhaps it's not being taught well, or explained why it's being taught, or something.  ""English skills"", the stuff being taught once you know how to understand words, is how to read what is in front of you.  What is the person who wrote this actually trying to say, and how are they using language to say it.  Are they suggesting ideas indirectly, are they going in one direction to make you react the other way, are they telling they truth through palatable lies or telling lies through what seems like facts?    Skills that poets and authors from all sorts of media use to communicate idea are essentially about manipulating your thinking by getting in behind your language system, because no-one stops to think about the words they choose to think with.  Art does this to communicate truths; Politics and Advertising uses it for... other things.  And yet the overwhelming response to this skillset is ""maybe the curtains are just fucking blue.""  It's an anti-intellectual streak feeding this kind of thinking and it's no surprise that certain elements of society encourage depowering this kind of education.    Critical thinking isn't just about logic."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,flashmedallion,20,Sat Jun 6 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with the way it's taught is that it's presented using classical literature that is often as stale as possible. You could teach critical reasoning in literature without using human drama pieces that feel like centuries-old and therefore only vaguely relatable gossip.   The problem is literature teaching isn't centered on teaching you critical reasoning or even literature appreciation. It's all about grinding through something you can't relate to and mining out all the possible symbolism, archetypes, and themes. To the teachers and schools it feels like you're giving students an important toolset to recognize these things in other works, but all you're really teaching is that the best literature is what we forced you to read and you hated it, so reading probably just isn't your thing.   TL;DR: Show me a 20-something who hates to read fiction and I'll show you a terrible literature teacher/school system."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,WalterFStarbuck,7,Sat Jun 6 20:49:47 2015 UTC,"Classical literature is classical for a reason. The fact that texts are still read after hundreds of years shows that they have consistently been related to and understood by generation after generation of people. Blame the teachers, not the material."

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,powderdd,8,Sun Jun 7 00:04:33 2015 UTC,"While yes it is classical for a reason, at the same time forcing people to read it, and then wondering why people don't like to read is just silly.  I love to read.  I have 3 bookshelves that are full of books I've spent my hard earned money on.  I still am not a huge fan of classical literature. While I enjoy it more then I have in the past, it still takes a lot of effort to read it.  Don't blame the teachers nor the material. Blame the system that forces such ineffective ways of teaching."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,PepsiStudent,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"It's not even just the teachers.  There's a political element there - there are expectations that schools teach ""culture"" and ""the classics"".  While I still think teaching classical literature, or things like Shakespeare is actually quite important (partially for the reasons you described), there'a also a dogmatic element to it that goes far beyond a teacher picking it to teach with.  To put it another way, there'd be a lot of noise about a curriculum that focused entirely on, I dunno, the movie Snowpiercer (a great example of what could be taught in schools, it's very well coded and very relevant) and other films and writing from the last ten years.  Schools are poorly funded and have enough trouble with keeping ""society"" happy with what they're teaching as it is.  It goes beyond individual teachers or teachers as a group, and further to a larger system that has a vested interest in not educating kids too well."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,flashmedallion,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is. I think the majority of classics are too mature/above the enjoyment level of most high school and often college students taking gen ed humanities courses. I've revisited some classics and appreciated them much more now that I'm a more mature person -- they are more relatable to me. But in high school I hated most of them. I still don't enjoy many of them and I'll argue all day that some classics authors are heavily overrated.  I think from the students' perspective the problem is two-fold -- (1) most are too young to really appreciate most classics (of course some do, but in my experience they are a minority) and (2) they don't want to be reading what they consider 'garbage' and usually prejudge a lot of works so they get what they expected. Both of these problems tend to diminish or disappear with age/maturity.  Unfortunately, there is no other way to make sure a large percentage of the general population has a better exposure to the classics than during high school and college. I don't really think there is a solution other than to make reading in general more interesting with fewer classics and more modern, relatable books. Then students will seek out the classics when they want to."

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,SpacemanSPD,24,Sat Jun 6 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"I think a large part of the problem is, with any subject, if a student ends up with a ""bad"" teacher for it, they'll just end up hating the subject.  I've had teachers that couldn't teach history to save their lives, math teachers that made female students feel really uncomfortable, English teachers that saw their class as a soapbox to jam their political opinions down your throat and racist foreign language teachers.  At any point one of those teachers is killing a subject for a student forever. Girls are going into math and getting creeped out, people are taking history and getting bored- because the teachers just suck.  It took one history teacher showing up drunk FIVE times in one school year before he was fired. Like, at least in California, the state just pays teachers way too little to attract any significant amount of quality teachers and then offers the awful teachers they did hire WAY too much job security."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,Taladar,19,Sat Jun 6 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"While I agree completely I also think there is often a problem higher up the chain, where the curriculum is designed. Take Algebra for example, kids learn all those properties, commutative, distributive, associative laws,... but they are never told about most of the examples this applies to, why it is worth bothering with these abstractions at all even though combining such lessons with some basic functional programming lessons would yield dozens of examples where it can matter whether something is .e.g associative or not.  Even with basic arithmetic and trigonometry they often don't truly bridge the gap to everyday tasks like checking if you have enough money on you at the store before you reach the cashier or figuring out if that new piece of furniture you bought will fit through your door or in your car.  Linear Algebra could be much more easily motivated by introducing it in the context of 2D and 3D graphics rendering or even physics examples.  Or take history, many lessons seem to be designed to teach you the names and dates of events but completely leave out why those events were important in a larger context. They don't mention that WW2 would have been very different if most of the politicians at the time hadn't been soldiers in WW1 and if they hadn't seen the horrors of trench warfare first-hand in many cases. They don't mention the historic significance of middle eastern politics by the European powers at the time in the early 20th and late 19th century to the situation in that region today.  There also seems to be a clear bias toward teaching things that are easy to test instead of things that are actually useful. We do not need to memorize little details...we need the skeleton of knowledge to know some piece of knowledge exists and where to look it up when we need it.  I just think we need to look at our great teachers for each subject and see what makes them great instead of sticking to doing things the way they have been done since the 19th century.  Why is e.g. Dan Carlin with his Hardcore History podcast a better teacher of History than any teacher I (and many others) ever had in school? Why was Carl Sagan better at teaching people about science and cosmology than many others? Why am I watching Vi Hart explain mathematical things on Youtube that would have been boring the way they explain them in school?"
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,SpacemanSPD,6,Sat Jun 6 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree completely. You just reminded me of my favorite history professor ever, he served in Vietnam as a medic, he said he was mostly stationed in triage tents just keeping soldiers comfortable as they died.  Every. Single. Class. He would start his lecture and suddenly drift off into a story of his time in Vietnam, and t was absolutely fascinating. He told us how he eventually started recording soldier's last words as they died in notebooks, and he claimed to have tons of them just sitting in his house, waiting to be destroyed when he passes away so no one else can read what those boys told him.  It brought the entire subject to life. He wasn't talking about politics or important dates or events, just talking about how it was to be a medic in Vietnam, disconnected from the orders that sent you there.  I've never had a good math professor, I only ever managed to pass calculus with the help of a girl I was dating. Your ideas for math sound fascinating, but I can think of a few states, California especially, where it's just a pipe dream. The teachers unions fight tooth and nail to keep the status quo here, and they'd resist this new math technology if it became ubiquitous, because it would be the death knell for so many teachers past their prime.  Then of course there's the constant gutting and squandering of money set aside for education. My local school board is under federal investigation for the MOST EXPENSIVE school renovation in country history. This school district encompasses the poorest district in the California Bay Area, part of the renovations include redoing a football field for a school that had its football field receive a $1 million renovation not but 5 years before.   Between incompetent staff, old guard unions fighting change, criminal legislators and other elected officials, it just seems like a long hard fight to do anything with education, but I think Bush Jr. Had the right IDEA with No Child Left Behind, I think we need a federal education standard, because, at least in the case of MY state, we are completely incapable of handling it ourselves."

I live in Chicago, and we have the same problem regarding an inadequate public school system and a teacher's union that is incredibly powerful and reluctant to change. Something I've noticed occurring here that is pretty controversial is the emergence of charter schools. It basically maintains public funding (based on school enrollment), but completely cuts the union out of the equation.  It's not the perfect solution by any means, but I am excited to see an option that allows for dramatic change in curriculums, school/teacher accountability, and the ability for parents to choose schools for their kids instead of being sentenced to whichever school you happen to live next to.

I know I wouldn't be as interested in poetry as I am if we hadn't looked at war poetry when I was 16. The only poetry I'd been exposed to until then was mainly sonnets and love poetry, which gave me the impression most poetry was boring. I wouldn't have looked up more about poetry outside school myself if I hadn't seen some great war poetry in class.  I think we just have different ideas about what the basics should be.

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,NDdownVOTED,12,Sat Jun 6 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"This is part of my issue with people who make statements like this.  An education is not meant to be training for your adult life. That is one thing it can do, but its only one of its aims. Education seeks to empower citizens with the tools necessary to be critical thinkers and problem solvers. You can argue about whether this goal is being met, but without math, literature, and science your education fails to meet this goal.  Instead you fall further down this hole of being a person who cannot be an independent thinker. This, honestly, is the biggest disservice to a population IMO. Anyone can learn menial things such as doing your taxes, but being taught how to think is a valuable opportunity.  I hear many people complain that they will never use math in real life, but that's exactly the mindset that ensures they won't. Learning the subjects isn't about getting some kind of tangible skill. Its about developing a cognitive tool that you can use. To learn how to approach a problem in a certain way. In math its to learn how to abstract an idea and engage in problem solving. Science wants to teach how to break down ideas into their components and study them in systematic ways. Literature shows the way that we can form interconnections between ideas that at first seem disparate,and how to generate and extract meaning from our language. These are all things that help you become a more empowered individual that cab navigate the complex world we live in where you will have to make difficult decisions.  By all means, teach life skills in school. Its helpful and helps give students something to apply in their lives. However the rest is there for a reason, and its unfortunate that students often do not recognize its value."

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,TitoTheMidget,5,Sun Jun 7 14:24:40 2015 UTC,"My history classes were exclusively a white washed American history each and every year. Every year it would just go into a little more detail about how great America is, but it never went into real history. It was all the fairy tale stuff.  I was so excited my senior year when I could take World History. Finally I get to learn something about the rest of the world. Nope. Did a little more on European History before spending the second half of the semester going over American history again."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,Slukaj,2,Sat Jun 6 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I think AP courses should be mandatory. You're required to learn what the AP board requires, not what your teacher thinks is important."
QuotesPorn,38s7rh,TitoTheMidget,2,Sat Jun 6 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"All teachers are held to standards, regardless of whether they teach AP or not.  Here's the difference, when it comes to social studies, from a former social studies teacher.  A lot of social studies teachers don't give a fuck about their classes. I won't say all, or even most, because that's not true, but a lot don't. The thing is, history teachers are a dime a dozen. We hear a lot about the teacher shortage, but really it's only a shortage of math, science, and in some cases English teachers. A history teaching position opens up, you've got hundreds of resumes, even in schools people otherwise don't want to work in. When it comes to history teachers, there's a surplus.  So, if you're a history teacher looking for a job, how do you stand out? You point out what you can do besides teach history. Maybe you can also teach English as a second language. Maybe you can teach mild intervention special ed. Me, I also taught economics. But most frequently, the thing people can do is coach. Ever wonder why most of the teacher/coaches were social studies teachers? Because that's how you get hired as a social studies teacher, that's why. As long as you keep coaching those kids, you can teach your class with the minimal acceptable standard to pass evaluation and they're not gonna give you too hard a time, because replacing you would involve replacing a teacher and a coach. There are a not-insignificant number of social studies teachers who majored in social studies education so they could coach, and they see teaching as the necessary evil of their ""real"" job."

Need to care more about the faculty whose performance (as measured by standardized test) is most directly tied to keeping your job.

QuotesPorn,38s7rh,Premaximum,-3,Sat Jun 6 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"In 1988, Apartheid was still happening, the US was just starting to recognize it (but still pretty scared to piss off their business partners in Africa), and it was absolutely not part of the high school curriculum. I was there. It would have been covered in advanced World Politics type courses, but not the core classes.   Our rate of Spanish in America is quickly rising and has for the past 30 years!   This was in 1988. Spanish was considered a poor second to French. We were told that French was the future of business and smart kids should learn that so they didn't get left behind. I took Spanish anyway because I heard it was easier. There were a few Spanish-speaking kids around (because I'm in Florida), but nobody assumed Spanish would become a huge phenomenon. EDIT: and I kind of envy kids these days who can actually use their Spanish outside of the classroom!  Anyway, the specifics of his quote have changed, but the point hasn't. Being taught how to detect basic scams is a simple skill that should be covered in core curriculum, not just for people who happen to take a business elective course."

This quote is taken from Tupac in school, to an educational official visiting his school. They asked Students questions about education, their social background, their school, what they are being taught, and recorded it on camera to review later.  That particular student so happened to grow up and become famous rapper, so the footage was leaked on the internet in the early 2000s years after his death. This was not a recording that was supposed to made public, or done by an adult famous Tupac Shakur. It was an off the cuff comment to school officials of his school.  They asked him all sorts of random shit, and he had his head on his shoulders more than most adults do today.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQtoZ2Hbn_g"

QuotesPorn,38d6sz,athanathios,12,Wed Jun 3 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough this applies to meditation. The Buddha remarked a hindrance to meditation is restlessness, a lot of restless is rooted in the mind and our habits of doing one thing, moving onto another, the mind never has a chance to rest, as it's going from thing to thing, thought to thought."
QuotesPorn,38d6sz,Industrialbonecraft,-9,Wed Jun 3 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"Meditation is also a great way of blocking out life and thought. People champion it like it's the best thing in the world, when all they're doing is blocking out the shit they don't want to deal with."

QuotesPorn,38d6sz,athanathios,2,Wed Jun 3 21:44:26 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't block out life or thought, it doesn't limit thought either. It can cause the active thoughts to quiet down, this creates peace and space and happiness in terms of letting go. People have an issue with letting go though and this creates some fear of meditation, quieting down gross thoughts allows people to see the subtle components of thoughts, sensations emotions, even the acts of intention that create them, so it gives a whole host of extended perceptions as one progresses - that reminds of the cartoon that has the caption ""Now for something truly scary- let's be alone with our own thoughts""."
QuotesPorn,38d6sz,elphabaloves,2,Wed Jun 3 19:48:02 2015 UTC,"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of meditation, but so do a lot of people so it's not your fault.  Meditation is cultivating awareness of everything that arises in your consciousness. It's not blocking anything - in fact, it's accepting all of it without judgment.  The key to meditation is you learn to not get caught up in the ""mental drama"" anymore. Most of us go through life on autopilot, being dragged around by our minds. Meditation is a way to stop that process and - as a result - develop the ability to make better decisions and take more skillful actions.

QuotesPorn,384zsz,something__fierce,232,Mon Jun 1 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"EDIT: There is another comment bellow that says that this is not actually a Cherokee proverb. This quote has been posted before in other subs, (which is where I found the alternate version) but I hadn't seen that before. I'm linking the article directly here. I don't think that there is anything wrong with liking the moral of the story, but it shouldn't be arbitrarily attributed to the Cherokees in order to make it seem more authentic. I'm keeping up the alternate ending because I think that it is interesting, but it is in no way accurate.    I like the proverb, but I prefer the different (""real"") ending:   In the Cherokee world, however, the story ends this way:  The old Man simply replied, “If you feed them right, they both win.” and the story goes on:   “You see, if I only choose to feed the white wolf, the black one will be hiding around every corner waiting for me to become distracted or weak and jump to get the attention he craves. He will always be angry and always fighting the white wolf. But if I acknowledge him, he is happy and the white wolf is happy and we all win. For the black wolf has many qualities – tenacity, courage, fearlessness, strong-willed and great strategic thinking – that I have need of at times and that the white wolf lacks. But the white wolf has compassion, caring, strength and the ability to recognize what is in the best interest of all.  ""You see, son, the white wolf needs the black wolf at his side. To feed only one would starve the other and they will become uncontrollable. To feed and care for both means they will serve you well and do nothing that is not a part of something greater, something good, something of life. Feed them both and there will be no more internal struggle for your attention. And when there is no battle inside, you can listen to the voices of deeper knowing that will guide you in choosing what is right in every circumstance. Peace, my son, is the Cherokee mission in life. A man or a woman who has peace inside has everything. A man or a woman who is pulled apart by the war inside him or her has nothing.  ""How you choose to interact with the opposing forces within you will determine your life. Starve one or the other or guide them both.”"

""Such bad luck,"" they said sympathetically.   ""Maybe,"" the farmer replied.   The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses.   ""How wonderful,"" the neighbors exclaimed.   ""Maybe,"" replied the old man.   The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses and was thrown, breaking his leg as a result.   The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune.   ""Maybe,"" answered the farmer.   The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son's leg was broken, they passed him by.   The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out.   ""Maybe,"" said the farmer."

I think that the quote is trying to say that there comes a point in many kid's lives where they feel they must ""man up"", go to uni, get a job, take care of a family. They may leave behind their creative aspirations such as music, drawing or what have you in order to full fill a more responsible role to society.   In that sense it might seem as if they're ""killing"" their inner child and transitioning into a more rigid structured way of life. Those who choose to pursue life harnessing their creativity with music, art etc. are the ""kids that survive"". That's how I interpret it anyway.

QuotesPorn,37uvuo,happiest_tree_friend,24,Sat May 30 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Dogs can sense anxiousness in their owners.  If your dog is racist, it might be because it senses your anxiety (i.e., you're racist).  OR it could be because a previous owner was racist.  OR it could be because it grew up around white people and doesn't view black people as the same thing.  Basically, its hard to think a dog is just racist, since black people have dogs,"
QuotesPorn,37uvuo,issius,6,Sun May 31 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"OR confirmation bias. You think your dog is racist so you notice the times it is friendly to white people but barks at black people, and any time that's reversed you dismiss it as coincidence or an outlier. I really seriously doubt animals that aren't human are racist. Race is a cultural construction based on groups of people with similar skin tone and physical features. It's not real and frankly racism is a learned behavior. I wouldn't expect a less intelligent animal to pick up on the overall pattern or to even understand the concept of race."

I mean I feel bad that my dogs don't like most other dogs that much but then again maybe people shouldn't be so liberal in letting their dogs run loose.

QuotesPorn,37uvuo,NowHowCow,9,Sun May 31 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"Easy. Ask the dog. You say: ""Who's a good boy/girl?"" and if the dog bites you, then it's bad. If it wags it's tail, smiles, licks you, or in some other manner indicates ""ME! I'm a good boy/girl!"" then it's good."

QuotesPorn,37uvuo,Kafke,2,Sun May 31 09:38:59 2015 UTC,"I'll jump in on and say you have science on your side before your post gets downvoted to hades.   It's a projection thing, for the most part. One of the joys of owning a pet is having a living being that society has implicitly given you permission to anthropomorphise to your heart's content. Your anthropomorphism of your pet is then taken as fact.  There was a study that showed that the vast majority of people's pets' 'personalities' are a) unobservable by others without prompting, and b) very closely in line with how the owners view their own personality. The implication being that pets' personalities are less to do with the pets and more to do with their owner's beliefs about their pets and themselves. I can't remember the study, and I'm about to head out, but I'll find it if enough people are interested? It's really interesting.  My own little theory is that we do the same thing to our children. We're all a little fucked up because our parents projected a personality onto us with such authority that we start projecting it onto ourselves. Then we grow up and we have it in our heads that we are this creature with a 'personality' that we were led to believe in by our parents and society's implicit approval of our parents' projections onto us, but that projection is so at odds with our natural state of fluidity and, to use what is perhaps too strong a word, 'emptiness', that we kind of lose our minds.   But then, I'm depressed, so that theory is plausibly less about fact and more about 'I'm miserable, so fuck everyone else'."

My parents' pets (two cats) I spend quite a bit of time with while visiting. And they pretty clearly have two distinct personalities (both separate from my own). And I thought it was pretty clear to other people as well.  One is skittish, shy/quiet, and is generally reserved. Typically is silent and instead prefers 'other' methods of alerting people (physically bashing into doors, clawing at stuff, etc).  The other is... a pain in the ass. Little shit intentionally get's into things he shouldn't, simply because he's aware that he'll get attention for it (which he then promptly uses to try to go outside). Bit of an asshole cat and generally only does/likes things on his terms.  I figured these observations were visible to anyone who spent a significant time around the two cats. Since visitors and my family picked up on the same observations.  Or perhaps I completely misunderstood what you are talking about."

Who is to say things like psychic energy or telepathy aren't really a physical part of our universe? No one has found any evidence against it, so maybe we just don't have the equipment or knowledge to measure it scientifically yet. His quote is trying to encourage scientists to disrupt the status quo and study things that the scientific community may otherwise dismiss. As we've seen throughout history, scientific breakthroughs are usually made by some weirdo thinking outside the box."
QuotesPorn,37unta,Phreakhead,49,Sat May 30 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"There is, literally, nothing right about this comment.   First of all, Tesla received what would have been close to 2 million from J. Pierpont Morgan to develop wireless electricity, which was 51% of the total amount invested. Clearly there were quite a few people who were willing to put up cold hard cash to finance what you seem to think everyone thought of as ""mumbo jumbo.""  Second, nothing of quantum physics has EVER been considered mumbo jumbo. It's just that the theories seem far fetched to people who don't understand the underlying science.   Third, no one's found evidence against psychic phenomena since that's not how science works. You find evidence to support a theory, not the other way around. It is impossible to prove a negative, but what has been proven is that, in over 100 years of scientific inquiry, not ONCE has an psychic claim been verified. Seriously, the history of parapsychology is just a list of people claiming to have gotten results that they are NEVER able to replicate in front of a reliable, skeptical panel.   Finally, click bait articles and bad teachers might have lead you to believe that ""scientific breakthroughs are usually made by some weirdo thinking outside the box"" but this in entirely false. Scientific breakthroughs work on the Sherlock Holmes principle that, once you've eliminated the impossible, the only option left, however improbable, must be true. Thus, from the outside it may seem like these discoveries come out of left field, but they actually come from a series of experiments (or pure math, in the case of a lot of quantum physics) where all the seemingly ""in the box"" methods of approaching the problem have been discarded in previous experiments. You just see the weirdness since you see the final results, not the years of trials and experiments that lead to it."

But since it somehow squeaked into some shitty scientific journal it instantly cancels out the other hundreds of years of absolutely zero results, turning the debate into ""oh well see guys I guess we don't truly know what's out there."""
QuotesPorn,37unta,TheBlackBear,-4,Sat May 30 23:45:45 2015 UTC,"Reading the actual methodology of the study, it's very hard to say exactly how confirmation bias or researcher interference can come into play.  The design of the study was that the researcher alternatively stares at, and looks away from a tv screen while measuring the electrodermal activity of the subject.  Each period of staring and looking away lasts 30 seconds, and counts as one trial.  The staring and non-staring trials are randomized so that's its not simply alternating.  If electrodermal activity differs while the researcher is staring at the screen as opposed to when he isn't, that's evidence for some strange psi effect.  The result was that the researcher who believes in it got data that had significant results, while the non-believing researcher got data that didn't have significant results.  It's hard to see how confirmation bias could effect the electrodermal activity of the subject, as even if the subject knew what result to aim for, they don't know what order the random trials are occurring in.  The experimenters themselves came up with 3 possible explanations.  1) Experimental artifact.  This is deemed unlikely because of the many precautions taken against it.  It's also unlikely because any experimental artifact would likely have the same effect on both sets of research subjects.  2) Participant cheating.  This is deemed unlikely because trial order selection was randomized and chosen only moments before the beginning of the experiment session, and would have required the experimental subjects to have installed some kind of covert monitoring equipment in the researchers room.  3) Experimenter fraud.  This would most likely take the form of one experimenter changing their data before having it analyzed.  As the paper puts it,   ""Although possible, this would have been far from straightforward as participants were frequently scheduled back to back (thus cutting the time available for recording a false ‘replacement’ session to a minimum) and each experimenter made a back-up disk of all of the day’s sessions at the end of each day (thus minimising the possibility of an experimenter substituting data after the day it had been recorded). In addition, no evidence of any cheating was uncovered during the running of the experiment or analysis of the data.""  I wouldn't say this paper really 'proves' anything conclusively.  I would say that it is at least evidence that there is something very strange we don't understand happening here, which is basically what proponents of psi seem to be saying.  As a sidenote, I find it amusing that 'experimenter fraud' is a primary hypothesis used to explain the results of a research paper."
QuotesPorn,37unta,Khaos1125,2,Sat May 30 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"Results revealed that the EDA of RW’s participants was not significantly different during ‘stare’ and ‘non-stare’ trials. In contrast, the EDA of MS’s participants was significantly higher in ‘stare’ than ‘non-stare’ trials. The paper discusses the likelihood of different interpretations of this effect and urges other psi proponents and skeptics to run similar joint studies.   Right in the abstract they literally fucking said it didn't work and that they encourage other woo to take a similar approach to debunk it.  RW had no significant results, and the joint study they also had no results. MS had 'positive' results with their own study, and amusingly (not really) had 'positive' results with RW's lack of significant results setup.  It's pretty obvious that MS's results are a case of confirmation bias or some sort of fraud/wish-ful thinking. Otherwise RW's secondary results (with the joint study) would've matched MS's.  At least, that's what I took from the study you linked."

Code is just computer instructions defined in a human readable language which then gets interpreted/compiled into machine language which does ultimately come down to electricity running through logic gates.  They aren't talking about code so not sure why they are arguing with you and why they didn't clarify themselves but much of the field of computer science has little to do with writing code and more to do with theoretical mathematical concepts. Set theory, cryptography, algorithm analysis, etc."

QuotesPorn,37unta,saargrin,3,Sun May 31 10:35:37 2015 UTC,"The point is that it, by itself, is not a physical thing. It requires a physical thing in order to be implemented and used. But by itself it's not physical.  Just like math. It's necessarily used by physical things, but it by itself is not physical."
QuotesPorn,37unta,Kafke,2,Sun May 31 10:53:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. The actual physical computation is physical, but the code itself is non-physical. The code/algorithm isn't the electrons that run it."
QuotesPorn,37unta,saargrin,-2,Sun May 31 10:06:16 2015 UTC,"without the electrons there is no code, ergo it's physical unless you think it's somehow ""out there"" in a Platonic sense"
QuotesPorn,37unta,Kafke,1 point,Sun May 31 10:35:06 2015 UTC,"without the electrons there is no code, ergo it's physical   So what you are saying is that a water based computer requires electrons for the code to exist? What about a mechanical or organic computer?  You are assuming that the software ran on the hardware is the hardware itself.  You can implement merge sort by hand if you wanted to. Merge sort itself, like math, is a thing that was 'discovered' but not physical.   unless you think it's somehow ""out there"" in a Platonic sense   I think it's 'out there' in the mathematical sense. I don't think anyone would say math is necessarily a physical thing. ""1"" can be implemented in many different ways: one shoe, one computer, etc. Just like computer algorithms and code can be implemented in many different ways: by hand, in a mechanical machine, in a modern electronic computer, pipes/water, etc.  Electrons/eletricity is just the fastest thing we have that we can manipulate to execute code for us. But the code itself is certainly not dependent on electricity.  We can study and test code without a computer. It's why whiteboard coding/debugging is a thing."
QuotesPorn,37unta,saargrin,-1,Sun May 31 10:52:36 2015 UTC,"this is way off the original argument ,and clearly not what the quote was about ,but     if code requires (any kind of ) hardware to run on, it's  not independent of hardware, period if you dont have a head to run code in,there is no code"
QuotesPorn,37unta,Kafke,1 point,Sun May 31 10:57:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so if code is dependent on hardware, what happens once you get a decentralized system? Such as seti@home, torrents, bitcoin, etc.  Sure you can point to any one node and say ""this is bitcoin"", but you'd be wrong. Bitcoin is the collective system, not the independent nodes. But you can easily replace each node and the system still exists.  It's the same issue with transferring a consciousness, and accepting the same consciousness exists across time (with necessarily different matter).  You must either reject that the thing exists (bitcoin clearly exists as does the subjective experience), or you must accept the phenomena is non-physical (clearly the right answer).  Yes, it's dependent on physical matter. But by claiming it is the physical matter, you run into the identity problem. That is, take a boat. One part doesn't work and so you replace it. is it the same boat? Naturally. Now do this for every part of the boat. You now have a completely new boat. Is it the same boat? You'd have said yes for each piece. Now build a boat out of the old parts. Which is your boat?  The identity of the boat is necessarily non-physical, but is dependent on physical stuff in order to exist.  Likewise, the state of a computer can easily be decentralized and passed from machine to machine, making the state itself non-physical, but relying on physical matter in order to exist.  it's a definition problem.  Otherwise you must necessarily say ""math doesn't exist"". Which is really silly and you'd be laughed at."

QuotesPorn,37unta,TotesMessenger,0,Sun May 31 11:09:53 2015 UTC,"1) what do you mean, seti@home is the same old client-side code ...   Perhaps i was mistaken, but I assumed seti@home was distributed calculation; many people at home run calculations which are then sent back to the central server to work on a computationally difficult problem.   emergent properties of physical entities are not disconnected from these entities.   It's not an emergent property of the physical thing though. It's just an emergent property of logic. Anything that can execute logic gates can run code (and arguably run something like Windows). It's an emergent property of the system, which is structured to execute the code. Naturally. It's unable to be separated from the system, but what the system is made out of doesn't matter. And therefore it's nonphysical (but dependent on physical things in order to exist and execute).  Unless you are saying that a Galaxy S3 executing Android and a Galaxy S4 executing android are exciting two different pieces of software. Which is absurd, since I can write software for android that runs on both hardware. However a Galaxy S3 running Linux instead will not be able to run my code. The software is independent but relies on the hardware.   it's like saying that three-body problem is there even if there are no bodies ...   I'm not familiar with the problem, so your analogy falls flat. Sorry.   i dont see how you can demonstrate consciousness exists thru time.    Unless you are a p-zombie, or reject that you are indeed the same person throughout your life, you must necessarily accept this premise. If you are a p-zombie, naturally you won't be able to understand the topic at hand. If you reject that you are the same person, then who am I talking to?   that you personally have an illusion of it being contiguous is not proof   It's not so much the illusion of it being contiguous. I accept that (and indeed reject that ""I"" am the same person from last comment). However, that comes with a very difficult question (which I answered): If this is the case, then how come 'you' observed both independent states? If you didn't, you wouldn't have any perception of the past (that is, you'd only see a single state for eternity). If you did, you must answer the question. There's only two possible answers: That consciousness itself is non-physical and not reliant on physical matter to exist (I reject this idea), or that every 'consciousness' (instance of it) is the same subjective entity. Again, this is makes it a non-physical entity which is contingent on a physical thing, just like the other things I'm talking about. Both of these answers necessarily reject your view.  So either you are an idiot, or a p-zombie. And given how many people 'fail' this test and then outright deny there's any subjective experience, I'm willing to bet I've just come up with a p-zombie test (these same people also reject the idea of qualia, have issues when talking about sensory information, reject the idea of lucid dreaming, etc).   4) shall we agree that if the universe consisted of unbound atoms, there would be no math?   Nope. Provided there is something countable, math necessarily exists (otherwise the idea of countability, and thus countable objects couldn't exist).  However, ""math"" by itself cannot physically exist. It's contingent on physical things. But that doesn't mean it is the physical thing."

QuotesPorn,37unta,Fun1k,1 point,Sat May 30 16:12:49 2015 UTC,Afaik all we know points to consciousness being a physical phenomena within brains and that concepts cannot exist without brains they are a part of.
QuotesPorn,37unta,cmagnificent,2,Sat May 30 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"Well, as unsatisfying of an answer as it is, the honest truth is we really just don't know at this point.  You're absolutely right in one regard in that we know for a fact that the brain is obviously, obviously involved in our perception of consciousness but even then, psychology just doesn't get the kind of universally applicable answers that we do in physics.  For this, let's look at the medical side of psychology. Someone comes in and describes depressive symptoms. You'll notice first of all that this initial assessment doesn't involve any blood tests, brain scans (though those may come later) or analyses of the chemical compositions of the brain. It is entirely about the client reporting their own immediate subjective experience and if they describe their subjective experience in such and such a way a trained mental health worker can say ""it sounds like you have major depression disorder.""  At this point a psychiatrist may prescribe some form of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, the most common class of anti-depressants) and some intensive cognitive behavioral or some alternative psychotherapy.  The reason this is done is because even though there are studies that have correlated some (some being the key word here) cases of major depression to serotonin deficiencies in the brain. However, even knowing this correlation, SSRIs by themselves (sans any psychotherapy etc etc) only effectively eliminated the symptoms for less than a third of those suffering from major depression. (Based on the meta-analysis of treatment efficacies by Dr. John Thor Cornelius of UC Berkeley). When medication is combined with regular psychotherapy, the chances of alleviating symptoms jumps to almost 2/3.  So there are a few things here. Even in one of the oldest known and most widely understood mental health concerns, major depression, our level of certainty is still nowhere near what it is with something like diabetes. There is no ""oh here's your insulin shot, just don't forget to take it and you'll be fine"" in the world of mental health and this is because while the brain is so intimately involved in our subjective experiences there's a) Just so much we don't understand yet. We know more about purely theoretical phenomena in physics than we do about our own brains and b) Subjective cognition has a huge influence in how our minds and perception of reality functions as well.  Look at Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In the super vast majority of cases, there is no ""biological cause"" for this utterly debilitating disorder, the causal impetus is environmental, the traumatic event(s). What's interesting is that the same stimuli or same events do not produce the same reactions in different people. There are soldiers who come home psychologically broken after one tour and there are people who are held as POWs that have minimal if any debilitating symptoms and we have no idea why that should be the case.  The problem with psychology, or if you're like me, the thing that makes it so fascinating is that our subjective experience which is by definition not objectively verifiable has a massive impact on our cognition, perceptions and yes even consciousness.  Take a look at what I lovingly call the case of the Russian blues. The basics are this, in the Russian language there are two terms for blue, ""Goluboy"" for darker blues and ""Siniy"" for lighter blues. In Russian, these are considered as separate, but similar colors, in other words, no Russian speaker would ever describe the sky as ""light goluboy"". Somewhat like the relationship between red and pink and English, similar colors, but separate.  Anyway, researchers administered color proficiency tests to native Russian speakers and found that they had a significant advantage in differentiating between shades of blue vs. native English speakers. What's even more interesting is when these native Russian speakers were ""linguistically distracted"" (engaged in conversation/small talk) while they were taking the tests, this advantage disappeared.  Something as simple as language, fundamentally changes the way we actually perceive reality. Of course we know certain areas in the brain that involved with language processing and recognition, but we have absolutely no idea from a hard neurological point of view how or why something like language can change our perception and understanding of reality itself.  So let's bring it full circle.   Afaik all we know points to consciousness being a physical phenomena within brains and that concepts cannot exist without brains they are a part of.   As far as the best contemporary psychology knows, there is an intimate relationship between subjective, purely mental experience and the brain and this relationship is a two way street. Subjective experience can fundamentally alter brain states (PTSD, cognitive behavioral therapy, language and color processing) and the brain can fundamentally alter consciousness.  That's the take away from all of this and what makes psychology so intricate. It's a two way street between consciousness and the brain and we do not as of yet understand that connection.  Tl;dr - As far as contemporary psychology knows, it's actually a two way street between consciousness changing brain states and brain states changing consciousness."

The pills do exactly what they say they do, because they are rooted in biology and physics. Not all mental problems are necessarily physical, due to the non-physicality of consciousness and thought. Some problems are simply issues that arose from complex computations of life-long situations. Many phobias are like this. The way to 'cure' a phobia is through CBT, which involves essentially reprogramming the brain. No biology/pills would be able to do this. I mean, certainly with advanced enough nano-machines we could manually move all the neurons and such. But that's hardly 'the illness'. It's not the neurons that are the problem, but the configuration that they are in.   TIL about Synesthesia, gonna read up .

QuotesPorn,37unta,seringen,7,Sat May 30 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"The ""burden of proof"" is on everyone. It's unscientific to think otherwise. ""Emergent manifestation"" is a pretty big hand wave over how much we don't know about consciousness and does not count as proof, either. Be careful thinking that the rationalizations of science necessarily count as not reliant on a supernatural foundation.  I (generally) agree with your hypothesis, but pulling it out as proof is bad science."

QuotesPorn,37unta,seringen,1 point,Sat May 30 18:58:27 2015 UTC,I know what you're talking about but its not philosophically sound and you really shouldn't double down on burden of proof as a concept which is a legal term and not a philosophical term.   These arguments are as old as the hills and no one's going to win without much better science  and may not preclude want to be considered now as a supernatural basis
QuotesPorn,37unta,illStudyTomorrow,-2,Sat May 30 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously ? ""Philosophically sound"" ? There's nothing sound in philosophy and there's certainly nothing that is ""philosophically sound"".  If at any point in philosophy you find something that is sound, you're either wrong or you're not doing philosophy anymore.  In the meantime, a philosopher cannot assert of anything outside philosophy as ""sound"" from a philosophical point of view. Either this thing is not philosophy and cannot be formulated in philosophical terms (not possible) or is not philosophy and CAN be formulated in philosophical terms, in this case see argument about soudness for philosophical problems.  Philosophy is thought experiments. If you want answers about the meaning of this or that or about the nature of things, you should get into theology. They have answers, lots of them, each with lots of interpretations. Who knows, if you're lucky maybe you'll convince yourself one is the right answer."

Either he's referring to science studying things that science can't study (things that can't be perceived with the senses), or he's simply referring to things like philosophy (which has been studied for literally thousands of years before Tesla was born.    Another option is that he just wants scientists to look into philosophy, as if the thousands of years of philosophers simply weren't smart enough, which is retarded.    That piece of the quote is central to the quote, and, if you agree with me, it's one of 3 kinds of bullshit.  If you don't agree with me, then you have to admit that most of the responses in this thread are debating what he meant by that part.  If no one knows what the entire quote is about, it's a pointless, meaningless quote."

In which case he is not talking about our current methodologies of science and it turning to that which it currently isn't studying, but he would be referring to a future method of science with tools we now can't imagine.

Yet they are 'perceived with the senses').  Either way, there's a few real things he could be referring to:   Mental stuff, like lucid dreams and that sort of thing (hallucinations, mental disorders, etc). Wireless technology: radios, wi-fi, bluetooth, etc. Nonphysical ideas/concepts/algorithms: pretty much everything in computer science (RSA encryption? CRC checks? MD5? Decentralized currency?)   My guess is that it's either #2 or #3 in my list. Most likely #2, since IIRC he was trying to come up with wireless electricity and other wireless devices."
QuotesPorn,37unta,wigsternm,1 point,Sun May 31 10:07:32 2015 UTC,"You can't study qualia with science. Yet they are 'perceived with the senses').   That's reversing it - in science you can only study the things you can perceive, but that doesn't mean you can study everything you perceive.  (See: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.)  #1 can probably be studied now, by studying brain wave stuff.  You can perceive #2 without question.   #3 can be perceived in the context of computers - if it's in a computer, it's as easy as determining whether a electrical switch is active or inactive.  #3 out of the context of computers - that's math, which, yes, is outside the realm of science.  Math and logic have nothing to do with the physical universe - as Hegel (iirc) said, the only thing logic says about the universe is that the universe is a place where logic can happen."

QuotesPorn,37unta,Pure-Potential,0,Sat May 30 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"IMO he means quantum physics. Sure it looks like your feet are ON the ground. But they're not. There's little shit at the quantum level that is in between us and anything else physical that we ""touch""."
QuotesPorn,37unta,sd4473,5,Sat May 30 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Sure it looks like your feet are ON the ground. But they're not. There's little shit at the quantum level that is in between us and anything else physical that we ""touch"".   I don't think the word ""touch"" is the issue here. We've simply advanced our understanding of how things look like and interact at the molecular level. At the molecular level your feet are composed of skin cells and fibers, and those skin cells and fibers are composed of proteins, those proteins are composed of amino acids, and those amino acids are composed of atoms. The ground is composed of atoms too; for instance sand is composed of mostly SiO2. And everything is held together by electrons. When you walk on the beach you're not 'floating', your feet's atoms are literally being smashed repeatedly against the sand granules but there's no/very little bonding going on and that's a good thing so that way you don't disintegrate from walking on the beach.   I think for all intents and purposes our feet are touching the ground, anyone who says otherwise is just being silly."
QuotesPorn,37unta,Pure-Potential,0,Sat May 30 22:17:20 2015 UTC,"You can't say the atoms are ""literally"" smashing against each other.  You could say objects literally touch on the macroscopic level.  When one is in the micro level of particles one has to stop thinking classically, i.e. with terms we have developed from our macroscopic observations.  ""Touch"" at the particle level can be defined as ""interaction"". Our feeling of touch actually does involve the electromagnetic interactions, we touch with the field of the molecules in our hand the field of the other objects, and this touching involves the exchange of force carrying virtual particles, i.e. particles which do not have definite mass but retain their quantum numbers characterizing them.  There is a precise mathematical description given graphically by the Feynman diagram.  Look how particles are described by wave function.

Good for you, Wiki warrior. You are very smart, and a fitting mascot for /r/iamverysmart. But you should unrustle your jimmies and calm down a bit. I was replying to a person who seemed to understand ""there's little shit at the quantum level"" (which is commendable and probably more than the avg person knows so I'm not bagging on OP here), so I wanted to explain things in similar layman terms.

The posted quote might work better on its own to people that aren't as familiar with the book. However, I find the posted quote sort of awkward.  Also this might just be me (probably not thou) but it irritates me when some book/movie/person whom I really like is misquoted. It just seems wrong. This might make me a bit of a prick but oh well.

In her suicide note, shoe told him to tell everyone his strange behavior was attributed to the stress of overwork and her being a burden. She also said that she won't reveal the scandalous derails because his writing was doing the world more good than the hurt he was putting her under.   That wasn't very fun, but it does give scope to the troubles he might have had that he wanted to beat with a bat."

QuotesPorn,37lexd,MrHall,9,Thu May 28 23:32:33 2015 UTC,"I was actually going to mention Michael Jackson's 'victims' in my previous post.  The allegation was from one boy, who since redacted his comments.  He was also pressured into it all at the time from a jealous father, who, through very questionable circumstances had his son allege the sexual abuse claims.  In fact, Evan Chandler (the father) even said this:    There was no reason why he (Jackson) had to stop calling me ... I picked the nastiest son of a bitch I could find [Evan Chandler's lawyer, Barry Rothman], all he wants to do is get this out in the public as fast as he can, as big as he can and humiliate as many people as he can. He's nasty, he's mean, he's smart and he's hungry for publicity. Everything's going to a certain plan that isn't just mine. Once I make that phone call, this guy is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can do it. I've given him full authority to do that. Jackson is an evil guy, he is worse than that and I have the evidence to prove it. If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever ... Michael's career will be over.   In the same conversation, when asked how this would affect his son, Chandler replied,   That's irrelevant to me ... It will be a massacre if I don't get what I want. It's going to be bigger than all us put together ... This man [Jackson] is going to be humiliated beyond belief ... He will not sell one more record.    Eh, but who cares for facts these days, right?  In fact, if you really give a shite about spreading bullshite, you can educate yourself by reading this award-winning GQ article here: http://www.buttonmonkey.com/misc/maryfischer.html  Or just carry on chatting through your arse.

QuotesPorn,37ipaq,Darkside-,3,Thu May 28 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it certainly can be depressing to some. A lot depends on the person and their psychological perspective on life.   But defining human experience as nothing more than the material is misguided even from a position of non-belief. We're not bricks. We have desire. Things like emotion, mortality, the ability to hold beliefs, think, and an inherent will to live give rise to meaning and purpose and awe and cosmic wonder.   Life need not be divinely inspired to have purpose or meaning in the here and now. I'm sure you've got purpose and a list of things that give meaning to your life. All stemming from the material. For some lives though, I completely understand the bleak feeling of a lack of point in being here. I'm fortunate enough to not fall in that category so far."
QuotesPorn,37ipaq,usurious,2,Thu May 28 16:24:49 2015 UTC,Why? How would it be different if we were made of something else?
QuotesPorn,37ipaq,tinylunatic,2,Thu May 28 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"Because there would be something more to our existence. It isn't about being made of something else, it's about being made of something more. If we weren't just matter, if we had a ""soul"" component that somehow continues after our material body has gone.. If we had a greater significance than just being a sack of flesh, just living for the sake of living.. How could that be the same as being nothing more than a collection of molecules with a name?"
QuotesPorn,37ipaq,Kiwi150,2,Thu May 28 17:20:48 2015 UTC,"Not op but having a soul wouldn't necessarily = better existence. For example if souls and Hell were real.    If we had a greater significance than just being a sack of flesh, just living for the sake of living.. How could that be the same as being nothing more than a collection of molecules with a name?   It's been a criticism of some religion that there's an intrinsic embarrassment of the species and disgust toward the physical world and human form. I think your first sentence emulates the spirit of that sentiment fairly well. The vast majority of believers and non-believers alike all have greater significance than ""sacks of flesh"" because significance is entirely dependent on the observer's allocation of significance.   You're misrepresenting physical life without a soul as a degraded or pathetic state of being, devoid of purpose, which doesn't follow. It is everything it is now. Indeed Sagan implies all the abilities a certain collection of molecules can have like emotion, wonder, excitement, inspiration, attraction etc. in the phrase ""collection of molecules"", you're just either not grasping it or being intentionally misleading."

And from a religious point of view, how can you fault that? If there really is something more, something of greater importance.. How can we not have an intrinsic embarrassment of the species and disgust toward the physical world? We live in a corrupted world, where the evil prevails and the good must struggle to merely make itself be seen. Even atheists must see this.   The vast majority of believers and non-believers alike all have greater significance than ""sacks of flesh"" because significance is entirely dependent on the observer's allocation of significance.   And how does the non-believer define that significance? By scientific means? By proven means? Even if the non-believe can define their ""greater significance"", how does that compare to having a soul?   You're misrepresenting physical life without a soul as a degraded or pathetic state of being, devoid of purpose, which doesn't follow.   How does it not follow? Physical life without a soul is by definition.. degraded. Having a soul, by religious means, implies something greater than mere physical existence.  Nonetheless, the quote leaves an open ended question: ""But is that all? Is there nothing in here but molecules?"" It really isn't clear what he's implying here, and assuming to know so would be ignorant. One could speculate, however, that he is implying the existence of something beyond physical existence.   Indeed Sagan implies all the abilities a certain collection of molecules can have like emotion, wonder, excitement, inspiration, attraction etc. in the phrase ""collection of molecules""   If I am not grasping something, please inform me, how does the phrase ""collection of molecules"" imply what you say it implies? All these ""abilities"", as you say. The phrase simply implies the physical and scientific aspect of a collection of molecules as far as I see, nothing more. Emotions are nowhere near as significant as a soul would be."
QuotesPorn,37ipaq,Kiwi150,1 point,Thu May 28 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"...disgust toward the physical world and human form.   And from a religious point of view, how can you fault that?    It's not an observation from a religious point of view.    how does the non-believer define that significance? By scientific means? By proven means? Even if the non-believe can define their ""greater significance"", how does that compare to having a soul?   By their own arbitration and shared importance. Idk why it's hard to believe people think more highly of themselves than the phrase ""sacks of flesh"" implies.   You'll have to define what a soul is made of for me to understand how it compares because as far as I can tell there is no real difference between the inner-monologue or identity or ""soul"" from atheist to theist. They both refer to conscious human experience. Theism claims immaterial duality where atheism tends to believe sentience is an ability of the physical body.    You're misrepresenting physical life without a soul as a degraded or pathetic state of being, devoid of purpose, which doesn't follow.   How does it not follow? Physical life without a soul is by definition.. degraded.    No it isn't. You incorrectly assume having a soul is a better thing to have which I explained was false considering if souls are possible, so is eternal torture.    Having a soul, by religious means, implies something greater than mere physical existence.   Again, explain 'greater'. Is being in Hell greater than death?    Nonetheless, the quote leaves an open ended question: ""But is that all? Is there nothing in here but molecules?""   he's using those as example questions people ask as critiques of physicalism. That they miss the beauty of the natural explanation is his overall point.    how does the phrase ""collection of molecules"" imply what you say it implies? All these ""abilities"", as you say.   ""collection of molecules"" is just his way of saying human person. We all know everything human people do. The abilities come with the person. Emotions and beliefs are abilities of this particular collection of molecules.    Emotions are nowhere near as significant as a soul would be.   Do explain. What's a soul without emotion?"

QuotesPorn,37ipaq,TheOldGods,-8,Thu May 28 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Sagan is so dumb. In an attempt to rebuff the naive and dogmatic religious man, which is never difficult to do, he makes himself appear just as naive. ""Molecules, is that all?"" he mocks. Then he fails to give an account of the self other than to say he finds it elevating that ""the universe permits"" the evolution of such intricate creatures as human beings. But that's precisely the question... how is it that material, apparently mechanistic parts, can come together to produce something like a self or individual? How are these physical parts self-aware? Does it not seem that there is something over and above the individual parts? In a way, the naive question ""isn't there something else?"" is the right question. For Sagan, he cannot entertain the question because he has his own material-mechanistic dogmas to overcome. But his rejoinder is about as satisfying as telling a gobsmacked child that a snowflake isn't anything special, it's just the way the water landed."

QuotesPorn,37ipaq,Mr_Floyd_Pinkerton,1 point,Thu May 28 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"Happy cake day!  Well I agree with him generally.  Calling Sagan ""dumb"" I don't particularly agree with.  I agree that a lot of Sagan's quotes are used as a counter argument to religious thought, which I don't think is even necessary.  ""Is that all"" for example.  Now, Sagan cannot make his final point about why this irony is particularly satisfying to him without this statement, but then again that's also concluding that you are in agreement with his final statement.  What I have in conflict with his final statement is that ""the universe"" permits our existence.  As to say, the universe itself is so astonishing and complex, that our simple biology is fortunate to be in it's company.  My contrasting view is that we are intricately a PART of this universe.  We add to what makes it astonishing.  His quote almost states, ""you should feel lucky to be here!""  Which, in a sense there's some truth there, but that isn't particularly motivating.  It really only makes me feel like a whiner for giving a shit about seeking personal identity in the universe.  TL;DR: I don't agree with this guy's words explicitly, I mostly agree with his disagreement with the effectiveness of this quote."

OP asks ""questions"" in his rant to deconstruct Sagans so called ""stand point"" (which is quite vague in the quote) and then starts name calling.  here is what i know, Sagan is a conversationalist and he believes in ideas that are intelligently designed. he is no tyrant nor is he a bully.  edit: what im trying to say is that, OP's comment is an incoherent angry rant. he probably thinks using big words make him more right. which is why he was downvoted and rightfully so!"

QuotesPorn,37gawi,5uperhorse,1 point,Wed May 27 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"Even those using the dark side of the force believed they were acting for good. It was obvious the Republic was not doing well, and because of Jar Jar, people gained power who took things in an unfavorable direction. But they did bring a sense of organization to the Republic that it had previously lacked. I'm not defending Senator Palpatine's actions, only trying to point out that his goal was power, and he gained it with support. He did not believe what he was doing to be wrong, nor do most of the Sith.   However, the men that Alfred talked about in The Dark Knight, who stole diamonds purely for anarchy, could qualify as evil for evil's sake, if they were not trying to make any kind of political statement. But for the most part, people do believe that their actions are the best actions."
QuotesPorn,37gawi,ilostmyphoneonce,2,Wed May 27 21:44:50 2015 UTC,"So you've never done anything in your life that you knew wasn't the right thing to do?  You've never shoplifted as a child,  or lied,  or failed to turn in some money you found,  or didn't go back to pay for an item that you accidentally walked out of the store with,  or took home some office supplies from work,  or called in sick when you weren't, or cheated on a test,  or cheated on your SO,  or had that extra drink or scoop of ice cream when you knew it was the wrong thing to do for your health, or whatever?    You've never done anything, that you knew was wrong?  If you say no,  then frankly I will have a hard time believing you.  And if you are telling the truth then that would make you an extremely uncommon type of individual,  because this kind of behavior is extremely common.     There is a concept called ""negative pleasure"" which describes the feeling of pleasure people feel when they do something that they know is wrong.  Serial killers exemplify the extreme end of this.  Many serial killers know what they were doing was wrong,  and even wish they would get caught so they could stop,  but the draw of that negative pleasure is like an addiction which takes them over and compels them to keep doing something they know is wrong.   I could come up with dozens,  if not hundreds, more examples like this if I was so inclined - which I'm not.   But what I've already said should be enough to make my point."

QuotesPorn,37gawi,ilostmyphoneonce,2,Wed May 27 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"I think negative pleasure refers to how it can sometimes feel good to do bad things, even when you know they're bad. Guilty pleasure might be another term."

Also, there is a fundamental difference between free speech and illegally disclosing classified information to people who weren't cleared to handle the info. You can't just break codes that you voluntarily agreed to follow, disclose information relating to national security, and claim it's free speech. No. It isn't. It is as close to espionage and you can get, if not outright. The American people do NOT have a right to know every single thing our military / security apparatuses are doing. We elect representatives to handle this behind closed doors, to exercise oversight on our security, without compromising information. Do you honestly believe that the government should have no secrets?  Snowden broke the law. He broke his oath. He didn't try to handle this via established channels for whistleblowers. He didn't give this info to a congressman to allow the system to work as intended. He sent this info to a foreign organization that disseminated it to the entire world, ran away from his crimes (to Russia, no less), and has been basking in his celebrity since."

I'm all ears. Whether you're talking about Bradley Manning or Edward Snowden, both instances involved revealing FAR more information than what could properly fall within the purview of whistle blowing, which is the main source of legal issues for all parties, and the specific reason why there is virtually no legal defense available to those parties. It only takes cursory research or a very brief, albeit earnest, review of the facts to understand that Assange, Manning and Snowden all broke very serious laws, and much of that behavior is without defense. And you, without a hint of self-awareness, are telling someone else to pull their head out of their ass? Maybe you should bother pulling your head out of the sand."
QuotesPorn,37bhdi,GroundhogExpert,6,Tue May 26 15:57:33 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. It wasn't indiscriminate.

Sure the military fucks up, that's what happens when you put kids in stressful situations. Nothing new there.  It's easy to criticize our military but they're getting the lion's share of attention because they're effectively running security for half the fucking world.

Maybe because they were standing there talking to militants who happened to be holding an AK47 and an RPG.  The reporters definitely knew they were putting themselves in danger.   Also, I don't think anyone should be blaming the military. If you want to blame our government for continued involvement in the Middle East with nothing to show for it then go ahead. But enough of this ""the military is out of control, they're killing people"" bullshit. They are in a fucking war zone fighting a war against underground organizations. Innocent people are going to die. They are fighting against a hidden enemy that doesn't wear uniforms.   People act like before anyone gets shot they should go ask for two forms of photo ID and run a background check. That's not how war works. What would prevent civilian casualties is if the governments of the Middle East wouldn't harbor and support terrorists."

While this may not be illegal according to the letter of the law with the Geneva convention, since the van wasn't marked, it's certainly against the spirit.  People providing aid to the wounded deserve to be protected, it's simple human decency.  The person who stopped may not have even seen the attack happen.

It seems like you don't understand that the people they shot can fight back. The U.S. troops aren't almighty divine authorities just deciding who they are going to kill. They have to kill them before they get killed.   The only people you should be mad at is the government that decided military involvement in the Middle East is a good idea.

Assange is either being deliberately obtuse here or just playing to an audience that'll lap it up regardless. (Or, more frighteningly, he really doesn't understand what he's talking about, but that's a possibility as well, as anyone who's followed his career trajectory can attest.) First Amendment protections do not extend and have never extended to anything that constitutes basic operational security. While I do think that the Department of Defense has gotten overly cautious about classifying even innocuous information, there's a good reason that the news outlets Assange worked with to publicize U.S. diplomatic and military leaks wanted to edit everything to make sure that they weren't risking anyone's life.   WikiLeaks has an important role to play in keeping powerful governments and organizations accountable.  Assange should not be running it.  Both of these things can be true at the same time."

Regardless, the politicians most clearly responsible could have been held accountable and voted out of office at several points in the last several years, and the public could have taken action in other ways. People could have cared enough to force candidates to talk about these issues sooner.  Instead, nothing happened. We reelected a president who upheld (and expanded) the status quo. Hilary Clinton is likely to be our next president, for fuck's sake; she was as anti-Wikileaks as they get. Even if Assange deserved credit, he didn't accomplish anything. Nobody cared about the NSA until two years ago, and we've had two years to do something. Maybe mass collection will die for now, but that'll only be a ripple."

QuotesPorn,373lmt,YouBoxEmYouShipEm,3,Sun May 24 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"I've actually read the same thing could be said about Martin Luther King Jr. Apparently, he was making a good deal of money doing speeches around the country and his wife kept pleading with him to set up funds for their children's education, but he continually ignored these requests - seemingly so that the money could be funneled back into ""the movement"". He never ended up doing it.  It's a difficult position when you realize that some of these great leaders and thinkers may have had to maintain a certain unrealistic idealism to stay the course on the work they considered so important. I certainly wouldn't put Steve Jobs in the same category, but I think he had a concept that illustrates what I'm trying to say nicely. He kept up what he called a ""reality distortion field"". This protected him from many of the complications and insecurities that would stop a ""normal"" person from being so ambitious. In the end, it probably killed him as well, because he believed he could cure his health problems with things like a better diet despite every doctor's warnings."

Yes its good to be happy, to change the world you need passionate and happy people. But the highest calling shouldn't just be to simply release endorphins in your brain.  We are the 1% in the world. We live so far above the mean standard of living its incredible, for every person living with running water, an abundance of food that necessitates moderation, enough education to actually make a difference and an absurd variety of past times to waste said education on-for every person like us- there is a person starving, living in pain and struggling to survive.  That is a huge burden and i feel that so very few people actually feel it.

QuotesPorn,373lmt,Areign,2,Mon May 25 01:26:55 2015 UTC,"These people suffer so that we may thrive and if the only thing that will differ after the end of your vastly different lives is the location of the graves   This is the line I took to be a zero-sum mentality. You are saying that our thriving relies on their suffering. That is a zero-sum view of things. If one group is improving, then it must be at the cost of another. Instead, what we see is the classic ""rising tide that lifts all boats"". As the best do better, they provide greater opportunity for the worst off to do better as well. Our freedom of thought and work allows us to produce technologies that can vastly improve the lives of those in poverty. Just recently there has been a surge in people realizing that 3D printers can very cheaply produce medical equipment on the spot for remote regions in poverty.   If at the end of my life we have both had the same minimal contribution to humanity as a whole, then i view it as a waste.   Two related quotes I really like:  ""The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design."" - Hayek  ""If you see a man approaching you with the obvious intent of doing you good, run for your life."" - Henry David Thoreau"
QuotesPorn,373lmt,kabbotta,3,Mon May 25 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"nonono (i never said/meant that us thriving relies on their suffering in an ongoing sense, just the starting point, and even that, its more of abstract point)  I understand what you mean by 0 sum, let me see if i can explain my meaning better.  look at my words in a more abstract sense.  There is a balance in the world, in mathematics if nothing else.  If 100 random people are born in the US, and you gauge their height, there is a probability distribution. Some will be at the top, some will be at the bottom (we all know what a pdf is). So to have a baby in the top 1% of people, that means in the grand scheme of things that for the mean to stay at the same point, either 1 person has to be born at the 99th percentile or some other combination of probability weight has to be born somewhere below the mean to equal that out.  If you then think of these people as though they are linked (arbitrarily tieing someone at the 1% to someone at the 99% who were born around the same time), I'm saying that the person at the top can only be at the top (given a static probability distribution because were only looking at people born approximately the same time) because an equal weight of probability was or will be born on the bottom (note: this part is 0 sum, but its just at a single point in time and not the type of 0 sum you mentioned)  We were born at the top when you abstractly measure things like food scarcity, education, available activities...etc. It is our job/responsibility to effect that tide that raises all boats. I categorically do not think us thriving somehow hurts those in less fortunate circumstance, I just think that the individual who refuses to contribute to that tide, who sits on the couch while his counterpart struggles to survive is an abject waste of education and resources that the counterpart would kill to have.  as i said above, if you take one person with all the education/food/love/happiness he could desire, and another that lost 2 children to malaria and deals with potential starvation as a real threat every day, and after they both die the only difference between them is the location of their graves, there is something seriously wrong with that picture."
QuotesPorn,373lmt,Areign,1 point,Mon May 25 01:57:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what you've said here. But I don't fundamentally believe it is in our best interest to try and directly change the world for the better in all cases. There are some people like doctors who are simply doing essential work that society would fall apart without. But the antimatter principles that were used to develop the life-saving PET scan were developed by a physicist who had no particular interest in reducing cancer rates, but their work has done more for cancer prevention than many who have set out to make a deliberate dent.  This is partially why I provided the quote from Hayek. These issues we face are almost all extremely complicated. If I had passionately pursued what I thought was morally right in my early 20's, then I would have been pursuing goals that today I believe to be counter-productive. In other words, sitting around thinking about this stuff for a decade, from my current perspective, was much better for the world around me, because I largely wasn't acting on the policies I was leaning towards, that I now think were misled.  It's funny, because Jim Henson is someone I've been thinking about a lot, because he represents a certain kind of value that I often find myself predisposed towards underestimating. All throughout school, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I was going to work as a professional drummer. I spent hours everyday practicing and eventually got into a great modern music college in Boston. And then I decided to walk away from all of it one summer and pursue a Writing degree. I had a crisis of purpose like the one you're asking for people to have. I decided making music was essentially trivial and wasn't really adding any value to the world. I should do something more substantial like try to changes people's thinking through writing or policy.  But since then - time and time again - I've come to realize how generally foolish that was. And people like Jim Henson are the people who constantly made me reconsider the value of fantasy. There are plenty of scientists today who will say it was something like Star Trek that made them decide to pursue a scientific career. Something as trivial as a bunch of people dressing up and telling stories about make-believe aliens and their encounters was, in some real sense, the source of countless scientific careers and insights that have done an enormous good for the world.  Therefore, to finally shut up, going back to the Hayek quote, it is a bit foolish to try and rally everyone to ""the cause"" because we simply don't understand our situation well enough to know exactly what is going to make the real differences. But we do know things turn out pretty well when we allow individual people to decide for themselves what they should value and hold sacred. And it works especially well when we establish a series of laws that allow them to peacefully exchange their views on what to value with others."
QuotesPorn,373lmt,kabbotta,2,Mon May 25 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent. it is foolish to try to rally everyone to ""the cause"" but again, i think those ideas and those words are someone else's, not my own.  This helping the world is only one facet of a philosophy that is interrelated and interdependent. I think a big part of my own philosophy is trying to help the world but again, it is only one part. Obviously there are pitfalls if you look at it in a vacuum but it could also be said there are pitfalls in all philosophies.  Also, I don't see it so much as a cause as much as a drive. Like our natural tendency to reproduce. You are not going around trying to buy a nice car so that you can have kids directly, but all the pieces point in that direction. Similarly you aren't running out as soon as you hit puberty trying to impregnate someone at every opportunity. This is because it is (evolutionarily) AN aspect of evaluating your choices, it is not THE aspect.  Likewise this idea of changing the world is something that should be in the back of your head. Its not something you jump up and run after as soon as you are ready, its not something you base all your decisions on but its also not something you completely disregard.  If sitting and stewing for the moment while you gain a fuller worldview is going to make that eventual impact more probable, then that should weigh into the decision, (though it shouldn't be the only thing to weigh on the decision).  You also seem to have the impression that changing the world, to me, means something very specific, and that over time you have gained a more nuanced view of things like fantasy and inspiration. I think projecting that narrow definition onto my comment is a bit miss directed. After all, there are only so many people you can feed. At a certain point you can no longer raise the tide, you have to raise the ceiling. Bringing joy to those around you, inspiring people to dream is no less valuable than anything else. If thats truly where you feel an opportunity to impact the world lies, then drift that way a little stronger.  Anyway, i think i agree that it shouldn't be at the top of your list, but i do think it should be on that list. There are many prerequisites which I feel make such a goal easier to achieve, and without them, such a goal can be dangerous, but that doesn't make the goal itself bad and i am as of yet, unconvinced that you are more likely to cause harm, given the intention of changing the world, than with any other more traditional objectives."

For us as people with generally similar moral compasses to a vast majority of the world, that level of commonality would severely outweigh the difference we have with minority extremist groups.

As a kid you're strongly encouraged because you have time to build habits and skills over years that could lead you towards your dream.  For example, a kid at age 5 starts taking piano and has an immense aptitude for the instrument. Parents provide with lots of good instruction, and the skills bloom. The kid is able to feasibly chase a dream of being some sort of music professional.  Another kid, the same age, also takes piano. This kid enjoys piano, but doesn't have the same aptitude, work ethic, or level of instruction as the other child. This kid takes piano for the same amount of time throughout school. They were an OK student in a variety of subjects. Now this kid is twenty two and doesn't know what they want to be when they grow up, but they DO know that real jobs and careers are hard, so NOW they want to try to become a professional musician. The offended parties in this scenario are the parents or guardians hosting this fully grown child as they meander and make excuses instead of making bank."

QuotesPorn,36zsw3,AlphaWolf101,7,Sat May 23 20:47:47 2015 UTC,The first thing I thought of was Brittany Maynard. I remember some of my religious friends saying it was cowardly of her to take her own life instead of trying to face the challenges that God gave her. I remember thinking the exact opposite. It took a lot of strength for her to let go.
QuotesPorn,36zsw3,kabbotta,5,Sat May 23 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Dealing with depression and suicide is like being at the top floor of a burning building. You are told not to jump, that help is on the way, that there is another way out, but the flames behind you are getting closer and closer. Jumping out of the building is terrifying but the flames behind you are even more so. It's by no means the easy way out, in fact it's quite difficult, but from that perspective it's better than standing there and letting the fire consume you."

I had to watch my grandfather suffer and wither away from cancer. At a certain point I feel like there is nothing more you can do and are just prolonging their suffering. I do think that in some situations medically assisted suicide is the best choice.  Edit: I also wanted to say that for most people with depression who kill themselves, they don't just want to die. Dying is a means to an ends, it stops their suffering. The while point of that statement is that they don't want to die, they want to live on and live a happy and fulfilling life. Dying just seems to them, from their perspective the only way to end their suffering. From our perspective down on the ground, shouting at them to just hold on and wait, and telling them that rescue is coming, to us it looks like help is on the way, that there are alternatives and you don't have to jump. But we can't see the flames raging behind them, we can't see how close they are getting and unless we have been in that position cannot understand how terrifying it all is. I feel almost as if she missed the point from what you said and that this still in a way applies to her. Death for her and for the depressed and suicidal is just a way to stop the pain, a pain that unless you have been in that situation you simply cannot comprehend.

The first paragraph of that page says it all:   The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others."
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,ReefaManiack42o,3,Fri May 22 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"It's all about the learning curve, which goes through four stages:   Unconscious incompetence - you don't how much you suck and it's easy to get fooled by beginner's luck. You're enthuiastic but also frequently overconfident. Conscious incompetence - you do know how much you suck. This is where many people get discouraged and give up, as the only way to get past this point is sheer persistence. Conscious competence - you don't suck when you focus and put your mind to it. People often also stop at this point, as they're often interested in competency rather than mastery. Most people pick up the guitar so they can learn a few songs, not become Mark Knopfler.  Unconscious competence - you fully internalize the skillset and perform competently without extraordinary effort. You make it look easy. High end pro athletes often exhibit this. This is the true test of mastery, as this allows you to respond to the unexpected without losing focus. An example of this would be Jimmy Page playing at Earl's Court in 1975. A string on his guitar snapped in the middle of the Stairway solo and he transposed the notes onto the other strings while he was still playing.   There's a lot more people at the first three stages of the learning curve then there are at the fourth."

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Denny_Craine,2,Sat May 23 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"The President fulfills a vital role in the Constitutional balance of power. He's accountable, by merit of standing alone.

SCOTUS and Congress can't be held accountable because they're groups and they exercise their power in concert.   The President however is responsible for everything the government actually does.

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,TotesMessenger,0,Sat May 23 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"People hide behind the herd all the time, because it works. SCOTUS and Congress can't be held accountable because they're groups and they exercise their power in concert.    What is your evidence of this? Or, at least, what is your evidence that they do it more than the President does? The approval rating of congress is below that of the DMV, and every few years we have a ""throw the bums out"" fit at the election booth. I don't see how they are getting away with anything more than the President does simply because there are 100 senators instead of one President.   SCOTUS and Congress can't be held accountable because they're groups and they exercise their power in concert.    I really don't understand how you think this is true. The Supreme Court just basically can't be held accountable. Period. That has very little to do with the Presidency. And, as I've said, congressmen are held accountable all of the time.   The President however is responsible for everything the government actually does. Even if the vast majority of his power is delegated away, those people still answer to him and he answers directly to the people.    As we know, all Presidents take credit for the good things and blame the bad things on congress, and since the people who elected him have always been polarized into two easily manipulatable parties, they will only really get in trouble for it when the other side gets really pissed. Like I said, that happens every decade or so - maybe a little more frequently now.  But above all this, you didn't seem to even try to attack my main point. The job requirements of the President are simply unfulfillable by any human being. It's like believing some Communist commissar could be intelligent enough to direct the country's entire economy. It is something only the ignorant could ever really believe. At the very least, the executive branch should be as large as the supreme court. So that the decision-making power is distributed at least slightly. The idea that the entire legislative branch, with all of its myraid of influences from across the country can be checked by one single person is something I really don't understand at all."

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,loegare,33,Sat May 23 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Tolkien formed this opinion on authority and power from his time in the trenches of the Somme. The doctrine of British Army officers at the time was that the officer must maintain disclipline and respect first and foremost. That meant he was not to become friendly with his men, and that they must fear him first and love him second. Tolkien found this to be elitist and authoritarian and said his time in the army helped him appreciate the world view and the life of the ""Tommy"" and he developed a deep respect for the working class man. I'd say it's extremely likely that the inspiration for Samwise Gamgee was one of his soldiers."
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,itsasillyplace,21,Fri May 22 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"Other great libertarian thinkers; Thoreau,Tolstoy, Ghandi, Weil... The list goes on. This all makes me think of a great exerpt from Tolstoy's Kingdom of God is Within You  ""To suggest to governments that they should not have recourse to violence, but should decide their misunderstandings inaccordance with equity, is inviting them to abolish themselves as rulers, and that no government can ever consent to do.  [T]he specialty of government is not to obey, but to enforce obedience. And a government is only a government so long as it can make itself obeyed, and therefore it always strives for that and will never willingly abandon its power. But since it is on the army that the power of government rests, it will never give up the army, and the use of the army in war.  The error arises from the learned jurists deceiving themselves and others, by asserting that government is not what it really is, one set of men banded together to oppress another set of men, but, as shown by science, is the representation of the citizens in their collective capacity. They have so long been persuading other people of this that at last they have persuaded themselves of it; and thus they often seriously suppose that government can be bound by considerations of justice. But history shows that from Caesar to Napoleon, and from Napoleon to Bismarck, government is in its essence always a force acting in violation of justice, and that it cannot be otherwise. Justice can have no binding force on a ruler or rulers who keep men, deluded and drilled in readiness for acts of violence — soldiers, and by means of them control others. And so governments can never be brought to consent to diminish the number of these drilled slaves, who constitute their whole power and importance.  Such is the attitude of certain learned men to the contradiction under which our society is being crushed, and such are their methods of solving it. Tell these people that the whole matter rests on the personal attitude of each man to the moral and religious question put nowadays to everyone, the question, that is, whether it is lawful or unlawful for him to take his share of military service, and these learned gentlemen will shrug their shoulders and not condescend to listen or to answer you.  The solution of the question in their idea is to be found in reading addresses, writing books, electing presidents, vice-presidents, and secretaries, and meeting and speaking first in one town and then in another. From all this speechifying and writing it will come to pass, according to their notions, that governments will cease to levy the soldiers, on whom their whole strength depends, will listen to their discourses, and will disband their forces, leaving themselves without any defense, not only against their neighbors, but also against their own subjects. As though a band of brigands, who have some unarmed travelers bound and ready to be plundered, should be so touched by their complaints of the pain caused by the cords they are fastened with as to let them go again.  Still there are people who believe in this, busy themselves over peace congresses, read addresses, and write books. And governments, we may be quite sure, express their sympathy and make a show of encouraging them. In the same way they pretend to support temperance societies, while they are living principally on the drunkenness of the people; and pretend to encourage education, when their whole strength is based on ignorance; and to support constitutional freedom, when their strength rests on the absence of freedom; and to be anxious for the improvement of the condition of the working classes, when their very existence depends on their oppression; and to support Christianity, when Christianity destroys all government.  To be able to do this they have long ago elaborated methods encouraging temperance, which cannot suppress drunkenness; methods of supporting education, which not only fail to prevent ignorance, but even increase it; methods of aiming at freedom and constitutionalism, which are no hindrance to despotism; methods of protecting the working classes, which will not free them from slavery; and a Christianity, too, they have elaborated, which does not destroy, but supports governments.  Now there is something more for the government to encourage — peace. The sovereigns, who nowadays take counsel with their ministers, decide by their will alone whether the butchery of millions is to be begun this year or next. They know very well that all these discourses upon peace will not hinder them from sending millions of men to butchery when it seems good to them. They listen even with satisfaction to these discourses, encourage them, and take part in them.  All this, far from being detrimental, is even of service to governments, by turning people’s attention from the most important and pressing question: Ought or ought not each man called upon for military service to submit to serve in the army?  “Peace will soon be arranged, thanks to alliances and congresses, to books and pamphlets; meantime go and put on your uniform, and prepare to cause suffering and to endure it for our benefit,” is the government’s line of argument. And the learned gentlemen who get up congresses and write articles are in perfect agreement with it… And since it [this attitude] is that most beneficial to governments, it is also the most encouraged by all intelligent governments.

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Malificence,15,Sat May 23 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"Also please note that Tolkien was an individualist anarchist, which is one of the 2 main camps of anarchism  Because what no one seems to understand anymore is that most anarchists in history were also socialists. Meaning they oppose the existence of the state (read: hierarchical structures of authority) as well as the existence of capitalism. They support worker's democratic control of the means of production.   The more influential founding thinkers of anarchism being Proudhon (whose philosophy was pretty unique and not easily categorized), Joseph DeJacque (who is generally seen as the founder of anarchist-communism, and incidentally coined the term Libertarianism), Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, and many others.  Tolkien was an anarchist more in the tradition of Max Stirner, Henry David Thoreau, Benjamin Tucker and others who focused far more on the liberation of oneself as an individual. This isn't to say they opposed socialism, many identified with it. But there's a common notion, a sort of rejection of the concept of organized society, among them.  The US has a wonderfully rich history of anarchists, from Alexander Berkman who was imprisoned for attempting to assassinate Henry Clay Frick in retaliation for Frick hiring 300 armed Pinkertons to shoot strikers in an effort to break the union  To the Haymarket Martyrs, whose execution is a big reason that we have the 8 hour work day.

The only trouble is, you have to defend your crops otherwise someone can come along and jack them or burn them.   Therefore the problem with anarcho-socialism is: who owns and is therefore responsible for the defense of the farm? It's not the individual otherwise it wouldn't be socialist. And it can't be the collective, because that would mean state property and therefore it wouldn't be anarchist.

That's why we use logic and reason - to distinguish objective value judgments from subjective ones using reality itself as the benchmark.   ""Civilization"" was actually defined pretty simply by Rousseau as the invention of land ownership, which is tied to agriculture and the divisions of labor it enabled. That seems to be to be a pretty sound definition.   How much more intellectual dishonesty, red herrings, and facetious rambles through semantic nonsense can you spew out in one thread? I fear we're going to find out whether we want to or not."

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Scuba_Stevo,26,Sat May 23 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"Actual quote, full paragraph, not heavily edited towards OP's personal philosophy. Parts removed by OP are in bold. Parts that continue the explanation after OP ends are in italics.   My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) – or to 'unconstitutional' Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State (in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a chance of recantation, execute them if they remained obstinate! If we could get back to personal names, it would do a lot of good. Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people. If people were in the habit of referring to 'King George's council, Winston and his gang', it would go a long way to clearing thought, and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy. Anyway the proper study of Man is anything but Man; and the most improper job of any man, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity. And at least it is done only to a small group of men who know who their master is. The mediævals were only too right in taking nolo episcopari as the best reason a man could give to others for making him a bishop. Give me a king whose chief interest in life is stamps, railways, or race-horses; and who has the power to sack his Vizier (or whatever you care to call him) if he does not like the cut of his trousers. And so on down the line. But, of course, the fatal weakness of all that – after all only the fatal weakness of all good natural things in a bad corrupt unnatural world – is that it works and has worked only when all the world is messing along in the same good old inefficient human way. The quarrelsome, conceited Greeks managed to pull it off against Xerxes; but the abominable chemists and engineers have put such a power into Xerxes' hands, and all ant-communities, that decent folk don't seem to have a chance. We are all trying to do the Alexander-touch – and, as history teaches, that orientalized Alexander and all his generals. The poor boob fancied (or liked people to fancy) he was the son of Dionysus, and died of drink. The Greece that was worth saving from Persia perished anyway; and became a kind of Vichy-Hellas, or Fighting-Hellas (which did not fight), talking about Hellenic honour and culture and thriving on the sale of the early equivalent of dirty postcards. But the special horror of the present world is that the whole damned thing is in one bag. There is nowhere to fly to. Even the unlucky little Samoyedes, I suspect, have tinned food and the village loudspeaker telling Stalin's bed-time stories about Democracy and the wicked Fascists who eat babies and steal sledge-dogs. There is only one bright spot and that is the growing habit of disgruntled men of dynamiting factories and power-stations; I hope that, encouraged now as 'patriotism', may remain a habit! But it won't do any good, if it is not universal.   I guess OP wasn't too thrilled about Tolkien's preference towards Monarchy, about people knowing who their master is, or all the religiously-motivated reasoning. This whole letter (to his son, mind you; this was never a public statement) has a cheekiness to it, and unless you wish to propose Tolkien actually thought executing people who used the word 'State' was a good idea, and dynamite was a path to solving world crises, to take this letter as the whole reasoning for putting Tolkien in your own camp is a little foolish. No, that's putting it a bit tame. It's active non-thinking."
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Rightwraith,7,Sat May 23 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"The part that is bolded is a diversion.  Tolkien hated government mainly because of its tendency towards bureaucracy and loss of accountability that inevitably follows. He viewed with disdain the concept of government as an end to itself, and the people that talked about the ""science of government"". He saw that as a smokescreen for telling other people how to live their lives and a quasi-theocracy.   His musings about monarchy stem from this, viewing absolute rule by a dispassionate and benign monarch as more honest than the same through a bureaucracy as evidenced here:    If people were in the habit of referring to 'King George's council, Winston and his gang', it would go a long way to clearing thought, and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy.   Give me a king whose chief interest in life is stamps, railways, or race-horses; and who has the power to sack his Vizier (or whatever you care to call him) if he does not like the cut of his trousers.   You also fundamentally misunderstood this:    ...is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity. And at least it is done only to a small group of men who know who their master is.    What he means by this, is that authority is most responsible and accountable when the person vested with it is actually known by the people who vest it in him. That a leader has to look his people in the eye and say ""follow me"".   In Tolkien's day, the Monarchy wasn't viewed as the semi-irrelevant inbred celebrities they are today, the monarchy was a burden and a duty thrust upon the monarch to be England, and therefore be responsible not only to oversee the government but also to act as a moral, spiritual, and cultural touchstone - to lead the country in all things. A walking, talking symbol - and the need to keep up appearances becomes a prison, like it did with Edward VIII.   To Tolkien, the height of nobility was the disinterest in power:    The mediævals were only too right in taking nolo episcopari as the best reason a man could give to others for making him a bishop.   nolo episcopari is the now-customary refusal Anglican and Catholic priests give when they're to be made a bishop. The idea being that the authority was thrust upon them, rather than sought after.   And the rest of this is his musing on why authority is necessary at all in the first place - because other people fuck things up.    But, of course, the fatal weakness of all that – after all only the fatal weakness of all good natural things in a bad corrupt unnatural world – is that it works and has worked only when all the world is messing along in the same good old inefficient human way.   Basically saying, the spontaneous order is only preserved when we don't try to change too much, otherwise we get:     We are all trying to do the Alexander-touch – and, as history teaches, that orientalized Alexander and all his generals.   ""Orientalized"" referring to the tendency of Eastern/Persian rulers in antiquity to be hedonistic autocrats. He also points out how all too common totalitarianism and tyranny are:   But the special horror of the present world is that the whole damned thing is in one bag. There is nowhere to fly to. Even the unlucky little Samoyedes, I suspect, have tinned food and the village loudspeaker telling Stalin's bed-time stories about Democracy and the wicked Fascists who eat babies and steal sledge-dogs.   And he feared technology mainly because it gave bad men power:    but the abominable chemists and engineers have put such a power into Xerxes' hands, and all ant-communities, that decent folk don't seem to have a chance.   His allusions to monarchy mainly come from being English, but he was devoutly anti-authority while still maintaining that authority of a benign neglect flavor was a necessary evil. Authority in the English mind means the Crown. Tolkien's ideal government was   small disinterested centralized in the interest of accountability. It's a lot easier to hold a President accountable than a Congress."
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,hittingkidsisbad,8,Sat May 23 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"He viewed with disdain the concept of government as an end to itself   As do many people, not all of whom fall under the same umbrella. The idea that government should not be its own machine, with its own interests and machinations to their own profit, but instead should serve the interests of the people over whom it has some power is actually quite a widespread concept.   a quasi-theocracy   Bullshit. Nonsense. Prove it. Quote it. Are you perhaps thinking 'theyocracy' is a typo? It isn't.     viewing absolute rule by a dispassionate and benign monarch as more honest than the same through a bureaucracy   Are you then claiming that a benevolent dictatorship is an example of anarchy? Because being benign does not make a monarchy not a monarchy. Relying on people to do what's right is not the only step to take to satisfy anarchy, last I checked.    You also fundamentally misunderstood this   Funny how I can merely repeat the man's words and on no greater basis be accused of misunderstanding them. I don't recall saying anything about my interpretation of that. I recall repeating it, and noting its absence from your presentation.  The rest of your comment seems to be an attempt to act like I don't understand various terms, perhaps in order to present yourself as an relative authority? Or maybe you thought I was blaming you for not including the italicized parts. I wasn't. Quotes need not be exhaustive, which is why I differentiated between the italicized words that followed your excerpt, which might serve to give more information to people who wanted it, and the bolded words you actively cut out, much of which fundamentally alters the implications you were betting on people taking from the submission.   But even with your treatment of what comes from the italics, uou spend no time trying to support the idea of Tolkien as Anarchist, as identifying tyranny and bemoaning the failure of society to simply work itself out naturally are, again, not exactly uncommon ideas in political philosophy. They in fact fall in quite nicely with the idea of a benevolent, unconstitutional monarchy.  The simple fact remains that you cut out all references to monarchy, religion, and a definite (though approved and appreciated by all parties) hierarchy of governance. You did not do this because they were a diversion to what Tolkien related to his son Christopher in this letter. They were, in fact, the greater point, as this letter is more about what makes a good leader than if people should be led. You did this because they were a diversion to what you wanted to present to reddit. My point is that there is a damn wide gap between the two. And you know this, because you are clearly intelligent and knowledgeable and have put some thought into this subject. You made a decision to cut out certain portions of this, not for length, not for irrelevant asides, not for anything that quotes are commonly abbreviated with (and usually with a nice [...] to indicate it's not reproduced verbatim). You wanted to appropriate Tolkien into your own bag of famous people, to claim him as your own so you could proclaim him. It's something people do, and the most annoying form of celebrity worship. But why? If your own philosophy could stand by itself, why do you need to snip apart and sew together the words of a dead man? If he does support you, why do you need to edge carefully around the sharp bits?"
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,SaugaCity,3,Sat May 23 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah you caught me on ""theyocracy"". It's actually a neologism of Tolkien's own invention referring to rule by ""they"" - the faceless and unknown. But if you consider bureaucracy as a weird little religion with it's own special rituals and hierarchy, I'm within spitting distance of Tolkien's meaning by calling it theocracy.  You're accusing me at great length and with great vitriol as misrepresenting Tolkien, when it's clear, both in the original quote and the full letter that he sought a middle ground between totalitarianism and true anarchy, with a strong lean towards the anarchist side. Which places him right smack dab in the classical liberal tradition.  Monarchy can be benign, that's why they still exist today. Do you think there would still be a Queen if people didn't want her around?   So pump your brakes kid, it's just a quote."

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Zyllber,10,Sat May 23 15:41:57 2015 UTC,There's a school of thought that says all of philosophy is just a footnote to Plato and Aristotle.   Plato's thoughts on how to form a republic were very concerned about this very fact.
QuotesPorn,36wgi9,Divine2012,7,Sat May 23 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"Plato and Aristotle are interesting in regards to their views on politics and society.  Plato thought that knowledge and wisdom were necessary to temper those who would rule, arguing that by achieving these things, one could become a philosopher-king - Plato's ideal ruler. Plato therefore viewed the division of society into classes as inevitable and sought to make sure rulers ruled wisely, so society did not decay into timocracy, followed by oligarchy, and then democracy which inevitably decays into tyranny.  Aristotle on the other hand saw that some people naturally sought not to rule and to instead be ruled. And that this was fine so long as the rulers and ruled did not use this unequal relationship to undermine one's own moral responsibility to oneself, and become a slave in fact, rather than just in form. Aristotle figured that if this relationship was formed by mutual consent, common interest would unite them and they would be friends, while if this relationship was based in coercion, it would be a mockery of friendship and become master and slave.    The interesting contrast is in perspective. Plato approaches the problem from the top-down, while Aristotle approaches it from the bottom up. In Plato's lineage, we find Hobbes and Kant, while Aristotle's heirs would by Locke and Jefferson."

And especially slavery/serfdom. That got things done too, but that didn't make slavery necessarily okay. I know there were times when they were able to win their freedom, but they couldn't just pack up and leave. They weren't allowed to. Hell, in some countries there were LAWS against ""free people"" traveling or going anywhere and it wasn't to ""protect"" them either.   People like Henry David Thoreau wouldn't be tolerated in a feudal system.   It's a bit different in modern times, except in dictatorships."

QuotesPorn,36wgi9,LaoTzusGymShoes,-1,Sat May 23 20:10:19 2015 UTC,"If you can quote the start and ending of that paragraph in the OP you know full well that he was a Monarchist. Someone else quoted the full thing in this thread as a top level comment, I'm sure you've read it.   He supported monarchy to the extent that he was a proud Englishman, and the idea that a head of state is more directly accountable than a Parliament and civil service. This idea is the reasoning behind the American President, so it's not invalid reasoning.    The entire premise of the Lord of the Rings was the restoration of the old order, anti-Industrialism and an idealisation of traditional relations.   He was anti-industrialist because he was anti-authority. He saw advanced technology as giving the Saurons of the world more ability to threaten others. And he was a traditionalist, so what?    Just look at Sam and Frodo, it's the perfect relationship between an Officer and those under him.   You say that like it's a bad thing. But I do agree, I think Tolkien got it from his days in the trenches and the egalitarian relationship he sought with his troops.    Even his views on the Orcs and Easterlings, it just roars a racist view of the world. Like the man was a great writer, but he was far right as fuck.   It's fantasy. Get over it. Tolkien also had interracial marriages, and racial antipathies painted as foolish and spiteful (Elves vs. Dwarves). He also painted the Easterlings as the dupes of Sauron, and the Orcs as creatures rather than people, with little true will of their own. He also had the Numenoreans' exploitation of Middle-Earth men as the beginning of their fall from grace.    Tolkien was a lot of things, Anarchist definitely wasn't one of them. No Anarchist would support Fascism against Anarchism, no matter the situation, as he did with Spain. Writing letters of congratulations to Franco over executions of his opponents is probably enough to tell anybody he was never in any way sympathetic to the left. His initial support for Fascism may have come from his disdain of the extrajudicial killings but these things were reigned in nearly immediately during the Civil War.   He wrote an entire book about how power corrupts and you say he's a Fascist because he supported Franco? You do realized Franco himself isn't really considered fascist? Tolkien's attitude was Lawful Neutral/Evil is better than Chaotic Evil. He supported Franco because the left was burning churches and taking orders from Stalin (while Franco kept himself at arm's length from Hitler, culminating in his WW2 neutrality).    In short, Tolkien was a flat out, unapologetic, ultra-right individual. I don't think that takes away from his writing, which is good, but if we're going to discuss him politically we should be honest here.   I think it's pretty clear Tolkien would have been in good company with Henry George and Thomas Jefferson, making him a classical liberal of sorts.

You have the right to privacy so that you can keep things yourself. The right to privacy has no immediate impact on anyone but yourself. The freedom of speech allows speak out about wrongs to improve society. It keeps society thinking about others.

QuotesPorn,36r32d,jaynoj,31,Thu May 21 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Bukowski had a great poem on writing.
QuotesPorn,36r32d,The_Miskatonian,31,Thu May 21 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"See, I like Bukowski's work, but the hypocrisy that comes from him can get infuriating. Like in the quote above, it's silly, because Charles would have extremely violent episodes over the most mundane things.  The poem you linked is the same.   if you’re doing it for money or fame, don’t do it.  if you’re doing it because you want women in your bed, don’t do it.   These are two very, very big reasons Bukowski wrote, even if he's too ""hard"" to admit it.   if you first have to read it to your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your parents or to anybody at all, you’re not ready.   Is he chastising the need for approval/having doubt? Bukowski sent out hundreds, if not thousands of short stories and poems, hoping to get published. He's said before that he desperately wanted some sort of recognition, and also that he constantly had doubts about his work (despite submitting so much).   don’t be like so many thousands of people who call themselves writers, don’t be dull and boring and pretentious, don’t be consumed with self- love. the libraries of the world have yawned themselves to sleep over your kind. don’t add to that. don’t do it.   As much as I like Bukowski's work, this is the most infuriating thing about him. He liked to think being a cynical asshole made him somehow superior to everyone else. He acted like he was some martyr, sacrificing a normal life in favor of having something to write about. In reality, he was an inconsiderate, lazy bum who wrote because his self-destructive personality gave him something to write about, and it allowed him to live the life he wanted.  But, I'm also pretty sure he had borderline personality disorder, it's pretty obvious to me that he was at least manic/depressive. So I guess it's hard to lay all the fault on him."
QuotesPorn,36r32d,SSFreud,16,Thu May 21 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"I consider the words, not the source. If the words have value, then they have value. Whether Bukowski was a teetotaler, lecher, or whino doesn't matter to me. If an artist can create something that affects me, that's enough. That certainly does not mean I want to sit down and have a beer with them. Howard Lovecraft has gained meteoric popularity over the last decade, and he's certainly no model of humanity. I love his work, but I don't think we'd agreed on ethnic groups and xenophobia within the United States. The author's words are enough."
QuotesPorn,36r32d,The_Miskatonian,7,Thu May 21 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, sometimes we want to judge the artist harsher than ourselves and we just forget that they are human."
QuotesPorn,36r32d,staticquantum,3,Thu May 21 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, to an extent. The cool thing about art is that it's subjective, and often personal, so people can take away their own messages and meaning. And, as I mentioned, I'm a big fan of Bukowski's, but like you, feel I probably wouldn't get along with him in person (though, at one point, I might have- I guess it's hard to say).  That being said, I think context is important. This a sub for quotations. For example:   As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice.   Not that this quote is spectacular, but it's decent. But when you realize it's from Hitler, to me, that context completely changes the circumstances.  In this example, I find it hard to be moved by Bukowski's advice (it's not worded as advice, but it's presented as such) on how one should live their life, since he was a drunk old miserable bastard. I agree that it sounds nice (and I'm referring to the original quote here), but knowing the the author definitely takes merit away from the quote, in my opinion.  I'm not saying you have to agree with all of someone's ideas or like them as a person to enjoy their medium, but I do think who they are as a person is obviously important, if they're associated. You ever have irresponsible friends try to tell you how to live your life, and even if they word it well, you still keep thinking ""shut up, I'm not going to listen to you?"" It's because they're full of shit, and you know it =p"
QuotesPorn,36r32d,SSFreud,5,Thu May 21 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"The thing you hate about him is to me one of his most endearing traits. I get the sense in Bukowski's bravest writing that he's writing directly to himself, trying to muster the courage and issue the reminders to be the man he wish he had been. I don't think his personal weaknesses were lost on him."
QuotesPorn,36r32d,FormulaicResponse,3,Fri May 22 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe I'm misrepresenting myself. I really like Bukowski's work. The first time I ever ""got"" poetry was reading a Bukowski poem. It spoke to me because I had very similar experiences. I think he's gritty, but he's got the balls to say what most others don't. He's real, and raw, and extremely talented at articulating human emotion, especially those associated with substance abuse, depression, hopelessness, anger, insecurity, etc. These are often the most hard to articulate, and at least some of these are universal, which is why he has such a large following. Whe you're down, reading Bukowski will potentially make you feel even lower- but he'll express it in a way that makes you understand better than you did yourself, and it makes you feel less alone in experiencing it.   But I don't think that makes him any better of a person. And while half of the time he's completely open about his darker side, he also largely denies it, and acts as if he's above others (going back to the manic/depressive idea). I have a lot of respect for him, but I certainly don't think he's a good man."

Parfit, on the other hand actually bought his idea (that the self does not continue through time but instead degrees of survival) and behaved in a bizarre according fashion.

I don't agree that the ""vast majority"" of writers and musicians don't, to some extent, represent themselves through their medium  Edit to articulate my thought better: Also, as I mentioned before, it's about context. The ""needing personal experience"" bit only really holds up when it comes to specific advice. For example, a pretty popular quote on this subreddit is “Man is the most insane species. He worships an invisible God and destroys a visible Nature. Unaware that this Nature he’s destroying is this God he’s worshiping.”  Now, did Reeves do things to hurt the environment? I guarantee it. But 1. He, by and large, was an environmentalist, even if he didn't recycle everything or always do the ecologically correct thing, and 2. You don't need to follow this ""advice"" to know it's true (assuming the main take away is ""don't destroy the planet""). It may make him a hypocrite if he was extremely detrimental to the environmental movement, but it still wouldn't withhold any merit, because this isn't advice based on personal experience."

QuotesPorn,36r32d,kabbotta,-3,Thu May 21 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"One mean drunk on one annoying drunk...  by: Paul F Tompkins  If you’re over 22 years of age, you really shouldn’t like the work of Charles Bukowski anymore. I don’t mean you should stop telling people you like his work, I mean, literally, you shouldn’t like it anymore.  Why? Because Charles Bukowski was nothing more than a tremendously unpleasant old drunk who wrote and rewrote the same book about 40 times. If you’re a budding pretentious jerkoff in your late teens, get yourself any Bukowski book and hang on to it. You needn’t buy any of the others. Just read that one 40 times. You’ve got to trust me on this. And by all means avoid his ""poetry."" First of all, poetry is an embarrassing art form and is only really done well once every hundred years or so, and Bukowski was no Cummings. Essentially, his ""poetry"" was just one of his self-consciously squalid, repetitive ""short stories"" chopped up to look like ""poetry."" It’s no ""good.""  See, it’s just not for adults. It’s okay for those crucial years when you are trying to form what you think is a cool personality. Bukowski will not let you down then. Talking about him lends you some whiff of non-suburbanity, which I know you desperately want and need at this point in your still-formative years. This is the time to drink off-brand bourbon and discover Tom Waits’s early catalogue, when he was singing in a phony Louie Armstrong voice and was pretty much just as pretentious as you now aspire to be. These early Waits songs are all about things that would happen in a Bukowski story! Fantastic! But as forced as those songs are, they’re still a thousand times better-written than any single sentence of Bukowski’s. Early Waits and any Bukowski will stand you in good stead with aspiring white bluesmen and any girls at your local ""bohemian"" bar who are really into getting drunk all day every day.  (Also, my future New Beverly fixture, don’t bother with clove cigarettes. I guarantee you won’t like them and it’s not worth trying to get used to them because you never will and they smell like perfume you would buy in a hospital gift shop.)  What’s so weird about the Tom Waits/Charles Bukowski connection is that Waits clearly didn’t experience any of the retro ""Nighthawks at the Diner"" horseshit he was shoveling out, but Bukowski lived all of his own miserable work. So why is it so goddamned terrible? Perhaps because Bukowski was merely reporting the things that went on in his life, without any real effort to make these experiences into literature. This is the beauty of pretension. It takes a huge asshole to write about his fights, his wine hangovers, and his frequenting of prostitutes, but it takes an even bigger asshole to encourage him to do so.  Unfortunately, Bukowski lived and wrote here and is associated closely with Los Angeles. In certain circles, anyway. A little while ago some old ghost of mine from back east came out here for a week-long visit that I can only describe as excruciating. This is a guy who has a soul patch, wears vintage bowling shirts, and says ""dig"" because he thinks it makes him interesting. This fellow is in his mid-forties. How awkward! Needless to say, he was thrilled to be walking the same streets as one of his heroes, Charles Bukowski. I let him do this on his own, going so far as to pretend I had a job to go to every day so I could avoid this goon.  One afternoon, he came back to my apartment after having been roaming around Hollywood all day. He told me he’d gone and had a couple of pops at a bar called The Ski Room at Sunset and Bronson. Sadly, I know the Ski Room all too well, having been forced by my circumstances to drink there almost exclusively when I first came to town and didn’t really have any of what you’d call money. By the way, it’s not called the Ski Room anymore; its current name is Raji’s, and by all appearances it is a thinly veiled Vietnamese brothel.  ""Went to The Ski Room today, man,"" the goon said. ""I really dig that place.""  I angrily bit the inside of my cheek until I tasted copper and replied, ""Oh, yeah?""  With a huge smile on his face, the goon told me that he was informed that Bukowski used to drink there.  What I did not tell him was that this is hardly singular news. Bukowski was a hideous alcoholic and most likely drank in every bar in Los Angeles. If there is a bus stop bench on your corner, odds are he drank there, too. There probably isn’t a plaque, but try to enjoy it anyway."

Edit again: I was less misinformed that I thought. I need to learn to read before I speak.   By 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles where he began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade."

QuotesPorn,36k1tv,SheCutOffHerToe,15,Wed May 20 12:29:51 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. I swear half of you don't even understand what the right of free speech is. It is strictly, exclusively, a limitation of state power. It is not a definition of anything a citizen may do - or how. It is a definition of what the state cannot do.  The fact that more money means more ability to spread your speech is simple reality, not some legal error. It has nothing at all to do with law.  You have equal opportunity before the law, not an entitlement to equal outcomes."
QuotesPorn,36k1tv,Magsays,1 point,Wed May 20 13:53:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the Bill of Rights outlines rights that are considered inalienable (meaning we have them without question and that they are natural).

My point is that if ""Your practical ability to exercise it"" is proportionate to your bank account, then your right may as well be proportionate to your bank account.  For example: Theoretically, if you have the right to vote but, must pay a $1,000 to get a voting card, and you don't have a $1,000, you basically don't have the right to vote at all."

As you were already told, the right does not concern in any way the potential magnitude of your speech vs. another person's.   The right doesn't actually concern you - or any individual - at all. It is a proscription against the state and nothing more. The state may not infringe your speech. The end.

A wikipedia entry on the theory of Natural Rights is not even evidence that they exist, let alone proof.   If they exist, why do so many of the theorists cited disagree on what precisely they are?   If they exist, when did their existence come to be? Before the age of enlightment, were there no natural rights? That would contradict the entire concept.  Your wikipedia entry states that Natural rights ""rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws"". Name one such right. In this very thread, you are complaining that there is 1. a Natural Right to free speech and 2. It is being restrained by human laws. This is a contradiction.  The only thing ""self-evident"" here is that natural rights, to the extent they even could exist, are not meaningful unless codified legally. In other words, rights are explicitly, exclusively a legal matter.   My voting card example was just that, a theoretical example to illustrate my point.

Hypothetically if the law stated that we couldn't criticize the president, is our right to free speech being infringed upon?  Based on your argument, since the hypothetical law says we can't criticize the president, then our rights aren't being infringed upon if we get arrested for our critiques.   The article should have said, ""rights that should not be repealed.""  Obviously all rights can be taken away.

The government can't stop me from stockpiling guns, but that doesn't mean they have to give them to me.

Secondly without even getting into why those statements are misinformed, Africa was destroyed by European imperialism and capitalism. They did not destroy themselves. To say that black self subjugation is worse than white subjugation is fundamentally flawed because prior to this savage European colonialism Africa was a very tolerant and prosperous continent on it's way to unity.    Blacks sold other blacks to the whites for their own gains.   /r/badhistory with a case of cultural ignorance. Africans who did sell those to European traffickers come from a culture were slaves were largely treated with human rights. You work (maybe 5 years) and earn your freedom. Your families aren't broken up, backs aren't split open on a whim, not much of that 'your children and your children's children are slaves' and that's the end. They did not know what those demons had in store. Slavery has existed in every civilization, this European imperialistic racist oppression was completely foreign to them.    Currently, there are more black slaves in Africa then there ever where in the us.   Edit: American Imperialism and Zionism play a role in this again as well when you account for those enslaved from civil war in Liberia. The US installed Samuel Doe as president and protected him while he slaughtered his people which helped lead to civil war.   If you honestly want to discuss differences between white subjugation of blacks and black people's own economic slavery, look at precolonial Africa before tainted by European colonialism. Why are you limiting slavery numbers to the US? And why are you assuming that all slaves in Africa are blacks oppressed by blacks?"

How does this argue that black self subjugation is worse than white?   And the slave trade is still active in Africa.   About 700,000 African slaves currently while about the entire continent is under the foot of neocolonialism thanks to European imperialism. That is doing much greater damage to Africa than less than a million slaves."

Slave traders didn't care if they were white or black slaves if you go back to the start. A slave is a slave.  Of course once you start colonising Africa where the entirety of the population is black then yes all your slaves end up being black and the idea of a slave becomes associated with black people.  However it has only been like that in very recent history.

This statement bugs me because its simply not true if Jim works in a factory and he makes 50, let's say, shelves an hour. Each shelf will sell for let's say $10. That means Jim made you $500 worth of shelves in one hour. So Jim is worth $500/hr. Unfortunately Jim gets paid, $20/hr. (which is generous in my experience)   $20<$500... pay<worth. Why you may ask is Jim getting fucked out of $480/hr of his worth? Because profits. Profits> human worth. Business profits are reason Jim gets fucked and why your statement while it's supposed to be true it sadly isn't and will never be in a capitalistic economy."

Oh shit, now we just realized that Jim isn't worth $500, because the shelved cost a hell of a lot more than just Jim's part of the puzzle. In fact, at the end of the day, the business owner is making less than Jim on a per shelf basis - only he gets the benefit of getting paid on all the shelves that everyone produces - while he helps pay for their health benefits and makes sure that they get a paycheck every week and gives them comfort knowing that he is a good business owner that is going to keep them gainfully employed as long as they keep doing a good job.

By comparison, no one ever feared being fired from McDonalds, unless they were in management or higher.  Costco gets every penny's worth out of their employees.

When anyone is selling anything, they want to give as little as they can for the most money they can get.   That's just people.  Everyone is like that.

QuotesPorn,36foua,gonucksgo,2,Tue May 19 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Every employer wants to pay their employees both less and more. There are multiple forces acting on an employee's compensation at any given time, but the reason an employee's compensation is fixed is because normally these reach an equilibrium in a fixed region of compensation.  To say ""Every employer would like to pay their employees less"" is disingenuous. What Chris Rock is saying isn't that there are forces that would drive his employers to want to pay him less (as you're saying) but that being paid minimum wage means that, were it not for explicit minimum wage laws, his employer believes that the equilibrium point for hos work would actually be below minimum wage."

QuotesPorn,36foua,Stonemason103,5,Tue May 19 12:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. But what I feel is at the center of the issue is the fact that people need to be paid enough to actually live. What we're saying with the current minimum wage where it is, is that minimum wage workers don't deserve to have even a low quality of life, because working 40 hours a week at $8.75 an hour you are below the poverty line. You are forced to go to the government for help simply because you're not paid enough for your work. Should people working minimum wage jobs live like kings? No, but right now, if you don't have external support, a minimum wage job is not even enough to support one person, let alone a family and/or kids. And everyone who works 40 hours a week, no matter where or what they do, deserves to be able to at least support themselves."
QuotesPorn,36foua,Alikese,3,Tue May 19 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"Minimum wage jobs are not meant to support you. It is a low skill, low wage job and should only be used as something for additional income. That's why mostly teenagers and part timers take those positions. Nobody said you were guaranteed a livable wage doing the bare minimum. Now before anyone gets all upset and talking about whether that's fair or not, i should say I think the idea of a basic income is great. You shouldn't have to work three minimum wage jobs just to survive.  But if you force employers to pay more than a position is worth, the only thing they can do is hire less people or automate those positions. It isn't feasible to pay $15 an hour for an entry level position. Most positions that pay $15 an hour now require a specific skill set that took time and education to acquire."
QuotesPorn,36foua,Kinetic_Card,1 point,Tue May 19 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"To a point I agree with what you're saying. It doesn't make sense to force businesses to pay positions more than they're worth. But at the same time, people need those jobs because they need income. In reality, there are far more workers than there are jobs (Unless we start talking about specialized fields) so workers are forced to take whatever they can get.   And yes, for a lot of people these jobs are just beginners jobs. But for a lot of other people, they can't just grab their bootstraps and get a higher paying job. If you are born into poverty, or even lower middle class, your family (if you have one) can't exactly support you very well, so you have to pay for everything yourself. In order to get a higher paying job, you need a college education. College costs money. A LOT of money, as you probably know, so I won't go into detail about how much it costs to get a college education. So how do these people go to college when their minimum wage job barely gives them enough in order to live?"
QuotesPorn,36foua,DamienStark,2,Tue May 19 17:56:13 2015 UTC,The college thing is already over saturated to the point that you basically need a Masters degree to even stand out. Honestly if I was starting out now I would look for work in the trades. You can make a very decent living and can start out with little to no education in the field. That obviously doesn't help someone without the physical capability to do the work though.  Again I think this is all pointing to the need for a Guaranteed Basic Income. You are completely right that there are more job seekers than there are jobs and it's only going to get worse.

The fact that you think working a minimum wage job is the same as ""doing the bare minimum"" completely ruins your credibility here.

Now I don't make minimum wage. But working a minimum wage job is the least you can make and is not intended to support you. If you are looking for a living wage you will have find a higher paying job.  I understand that not everyone has the opportunity to move up but paying too much for a minimum level job is not the answer.  What we need is to make it so you don't need to work just to meet the necessities of life. Basic income is the best way I see as there aren't now or in the future going to be enough jobs so that everyone can move up."
QuotesPorn,36foua,DamienStark,1 point,Tue May 19 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"Okay. I've only heard ""doing the bare minimum"" used to mean ""putting in very little effort"", but I see that you mean something different here.  I think we mostly agree, even though I think there's good evidence to suggest that the minimum wage is far lower than it should be. It's true that automation and the concentration of capital will only make jobs harder to come by and we need to be prepared with a safety net, at least a basic income. In any case, we can't let people starve."

QuotesPorn,36foua,proteios1,0,Tue May 19 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"I was speaking hypothetically, not about myself personally. There is no such thing as an inexpensive school today, it just doesn't exist. A college degree is literally a barrier of entry into a good job for lower class people. I went to public state school for my degree, had a few grants, my parents paid for half after that, and I still owed $25k. The only careers that can reasonably pay off that kind of debt are in STEM. Not everyone in the world can be a scientist, engineer, doctor, or lawyer, yet jobs outside of those fields still need degrees. College has gone from being a path to higher success to being a money mill, but society's jobs still rely on and require college graduates. You can't have it both ways, you can't force people to pay for an overpriced degree for an underpaying job."
QuotesPorn,36foua,Cayou,3,Tue May 19 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as an inexpensive school today, it just doesn't exist.    That's such a ludicrous comment. There are plenty of schools that don't cost all that much, in the low thousands. They don't look amazing on an application like Stanford does, but it's a degree none the less. A place near me is $46/unit. So you're paying hundreds or low thousand a semester. Some of my friends graduated from there and have jobs. They're not working at IBM, but they make a decent living.   It's similar to buying a house. You can get one for 300k that's turnkey, or one for 200k that needs work and a little sweat equity.   A college degree is literally a barrier of entry into a good job for lower class people.   No it's not. It's figuratively a barrier to entry and not a requisite if you're good at networking and an interview. Also being a good worker helps.  Also, you're ignoring pretty much ALL health care related jobs that don't have doctor in the title. You want to be a nurse? You don't have to go 50k in debt and you come out with a really good career. Same is true for tens of other like jobs. Also ignoring any technical school training. My friend makes 70k a year inspecting cement and he stumbled into the career when he was 19 (he's 28 now). He's not retiring tomorrow, but he's making a good living with only a high school diploma.  I agree with you that mainstream college is a money mill, but I disagree you NEED a degree (I dropped out of college, in fact, and have a well paying job as a business manager, own another small business, and own a house in southern california [you guessed it, a fixer upper]). Read like 10 books and you don't need a college degree. Read up on sales, marketing, interview skills, finance, then 5 books in a specialty you want to do and you'll probably have a job.  I get where you're coming from, but it's just not as necessary as people would have you believe. Hell, there's always starting your own business, which again, read books in your spare time at a library. I didn't learn how to run a large business by taking 'business 101.' I learned it from podcasts and books and online articles."

QuotesPorn,36foua,daedius,0,Tue May 19 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, come off it.   First of all, having the latest technology does not indicate wasteful spending. What if it was a gift? What if the user participated in a trade-in program so it was inexpensive? Are they supposed to spend money on things that are only essential because they don't deserve to have ONE nice thing?  Secondly, not having a college degree, for many people, is a choice to NOT go 50,000 in debt. For a large percentage of my generation, college is simply not an option. Plus, there's no guarantee that after they've racked up massive amounts of debt that they'd be able to get a job. The cost of an education is outrageous, and I'd wager impossible for someone in a minimum wage job. In 1970, the average cost of tuition was ~$1500 per year. Today, it's about $11,000 per year and can be much, much higher.   A minimum wage worker makes about $15,000 a year. How could anyone live off of hardly more than $1000 a month when rent alone is easily two-thirds of that. Education? No way. Not to mention food, transportation, all the basic things people need to survive. What about unexpected illness? Saving you can forget about all together. Just because they aren't highly specialized and educated doesn't mean they need to live in squalor. Many people I know work two jobs or more just to barely get by each month. There are lots of people my age who's parents didn't provide a plan for education or life-starting, and have no real path to improve their circumstances because they have to work 80+ hours a week to barely scrape by.   It nots that we want ""more, more, more!"" We want enough.   Edit: a word"

QuotesPorn,36foua,daedius,2,Tue May 19 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"I don't meant to suggest that a degree will not benefit you. I have one. I understand that it is an investment.   My point is that for a lot of young people, it is just not feasible. I have a very close friend who is working for more than minimum wage, about $9 an hour. He had a single mother who died when he was a teenager. He had no funds set up for him, and no resources to fall back on. In order for him to attend college, he would have to take out huge loans in order to just pay tuition.   Not to mention that he would have to continue to work 40 hours a week, while trying to attend college, which is in an of itself a massive time commitment, taking his time away from other things in his life (like working to survive).   I'm not saying it's impossible, but the mentality ""just go to college, and your life will improve"" is equally naive and stupid."

Except, that it will pretty much happen that way. I want to agree with you, because I don't think you need a college education to have a successful and lucrative career. But, the stats don't lie. What did the article say? Something like 98% more per hour than those without a college degree?  I do agree that just going to college is not going to improve your life, because the degree isn't what makes your life better - but the time and work you put into it developing skills for the market.   I think the difference is that going to school gives you a much bigger advantage and gives you much more opportunity to expand your career - which can be extraordinary valuable."
QuotesPorn,36foua,Trenks,2,Tue May 19 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see your point.   However, getting back to minimum wage, even if everyone was able to get a cheap and accessible education...we still need people to stock our groceries, cook our burgers, sell us our clothes in the department store, etc.   If the only way to make a living wage is to go to college, then IMHO, we are doing it wrong."
QuotesPorn,36foua,wolfman1911,2,Tue May 19 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right.  You shouldn't need a college education to earn a living wage. College graduates should (and probably always will) have a much higher earning potential than non-graduates. What I think we will see is that some of the skills that are valuable in the world, don't need a formal education to be taught and learned - like programming.  I mean, right now you can be a sales superstar without any formal education and make a very good living. I can see programming doing the same thing. The internet is still very much in it's infancy and we already have TONS of free valuable information for people. I am very much in favor of a well rounded education - but that really isn't necessary if a guy is programming computers/robots to flip burgers from a YouTube education and a $1,000 online certification backing up his knowledge.  As an aside: for profit colleges that provide shitty educations should be annihilated for the leeches they are.  As for minimum wage - I think it wouldn't be as burdensome if we were able to provide better help to those that need it in the way of affordable (and safe) housing, access to cheap education and free (near free?) healthcare.  All these things should be rights in a civilized country. However, I do think there could be bad things that happen if we artificially inflate the earnings of the bottom earners in society.  Don't get me wrong - I am 100% a believer that a stronger middle class pushes more money into the economy rather than have it stagnate at the top - and that is what drives jobs and higher wages. But, I think the government needs to create the environment for that to happen naturally and not force the issue unnaturally."

Let's consider a hypothetical. Suppose the minimum wage gets raised by a bunch, and all of a sudden, a bunch of jobs now pay minimum wage, where they didn't before. What to do about those people? Clearly their employers thought their jobs were worth more than minimum wage, but now they aren't getting paid that. Do you tell them to suck it up, fatcat, and take the fact that they are now minimum wage workers, or do you give them a raise as well? If the latter, what about the people that make more than that? And that is to say nothing of the decrease in buying power because of the need to increase prices to pay their employees more, or the fact that companies will let people go, because they aren't actually just sitting on a pile of money marked 'use if the minimum wage increases'."

QuotesPorn,36foua,HappyOutHere,3,Tue May 19 07:59:31 2015 UTC,I'm an engineer and the work is pretty enjoyable but I wouldn't have spent 4.5 years working way harder than most of my friends in college if the pay wasn't guaranteed to be higher.

QuotesPorn,36foua,graffix01,5,Tue May 19 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Your salary is not about empathy. Look how many software and manufacturing jobs are shipped overseas today, it's a foregone conclusion.    Back in the day, guys would get raises if they had a family and ""needed"" it more. Should compensation be a function of who has the best sob story, and not based on job performance and supply/demand?"
QuotesPorn,36foua,ThePhenix,5,Tue May 19 20:34:54 2015 UTC,"""Back in the day"" is irrelevant. And, I think, not helpful to bring up in your point.   Since 1970, the minimum wage has increased 353%. Sounds good, right?  Except the Consumer Price Index has risen 482%. Education has risen 994%. Housing has increased 917%. And that only the past 45 years.   How is anyone supposed to improve their station in life when literally every penny goes to pay for things that are considered a) basic necessities or b) the ticket to escaping minimum wage lifestyles. Sure, salary shouldn't be based on empathy. It shouldn't leave the under educated and the disadvantaged destitute. Comparing two separate generations with two very different dynamics of income vs cost of living is apples to oranges."

People are doing a lot of moral grandstanding on behalf of the middle to upper class, when the basic underlying principle does not concern them at all. If you work a minimum wage job for 40-50 hours a week, you are honoring what society asks of you. Companies can't afford to pay a living wage? Great, then they're not a company, just as all of you are saying minimum wage workers are apparently not people. Businesses don't get off the hook on ""we can't afford to pay you"" any more than people can tell the phone company ""we can't afford to pay""."

QuotesPorn,36foua,kayla56,0,Tue May 19 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"But you have to think about things on a global perspective as well. Working in fast food is still insurmountably better than working in a sweatshop in some South Asian country. There are people in the global economy willing to work for pennies a day whereas we are enjoying our 7.25 minimum wage and cheap T-shirts. Sure, we can account for an increased cost of living, but what justifies our higher cost of living? How can we justify being paid 7.25 in the United states for the same job that someone in Bangladesh would take for 0.05 on the hour? Where is your empathy for them?  If we increase the minimum wage, what we lose are the very jobs that allow people to get back on their feet: jobs that require minimum education and training, jobs that are fluid in hiring and take anyone no matter how old or young or disabled. Why would mcdonalds hire human cashiers when they could just set out a bunch of ipads and hire an operator, a chef, and some cleaning staff? Especially with the rise of technology everso, we must slowly move into technical fields to justify EVERYONE being paid an amount much higher than the global average. Currently, we don't even have the education to justify that we even deserve the skillful jobs that we are so privileged to receive. Just take a look at how the US fairs in international test scores.. When children in other poorer countries are performing better than us on tests, yet receive lower paying, less technical jobs, how the hell are we going to survive? Two things would happen: the United States will slowly be drained of its prosperity towards the global average, and the US will be flooded by immigrants who take your technical and higher paying jobs (this is already happening). Soon, not only will we not have lower paying jobs, but we won't have technical jobs either.  There are definitely arguments that we should raise minimum wage due to the fact that we haven't raised minimum wage in quite a long time and inflation has made minimum wage no longer a living wage. However, you have to remember that the baby boomers had their relatively high minimum wage during a period of economic prosperity in America, whereas we oscillate between back to back recessions. Perhaps minimum wage should be bumped up a little to adjust for inflation, but adjusting to a quantity like $15 an hour for the lowest paid worker is absolutely ridiculous.  What we need to do is not double the minimum wage, but to strengthen the middle class (the median salary is $25 an hour), and increase education in the United States. We need to produce people worthy of receiving a higher salary when viewed with a global perspective. Right now what's happening is the opposite, with the middle class shrinking in power and the 1% getting richer. Increasing the minimum wage does not help with this problem whatsoever."

QuotesPorn,36foua,nidal33,1 point,Tue May 19 11:36:18 2015 UTC,"I understand that. But people get locked in cycles of poverty, especially in rural areas. They can't afford to move to the city and pay higher rent and have access to more jobs. Or they find a better job, but it doesn't have enough hours to support them, or is an unpaid internship, requires a car or travelling too far. People are obliged to stay with their family business/farm/secure job, things like that. They might have a criminal record or glaring character flaw.  People work in fast food or retail and the skills don't translate to better paid work. Near-min wage is a big difference from min wage, but still won't allow you to make drastic lifestyle changes.   The problem I am facing now as a student is I can't work full time and study full time and pass classes, although some people can it's rough. So I have to work part time in a job that won't clash with hours. I know that's only temporary, but even when you're young people will judge you for working a normal job and not a ""career"" job. Pushing people to get good jobs when they're not skilled to and can't fully commit is bad advice.  I'm not trying to make excuses for people who are unmotivated or unambitious. But assuming everyone in a min-wage job not looking for work is unmotivated is incorrect. Not everyone has the same opportunities as everyone else and I try to remember that before I judge people for being stuck in a dead end job for a long time."

I was completely vulnerable while gargoyling over this hole and cutting a fresh turd out of my body. Had my gear unstrapped and on the ground. My mind was racing about if I have to leave everything and bolt for civilization if this bear started to head my way.  He did stop for a second and look at me. Then he just went about his way.

QuotesPorn,369p7m,Lightfiend,17,Mon May 18 16:15:54 2015 UTC,Warren has some of the most cliche political platitudes I have ever seen.   It's amazing how Reddit eats them up. Considering we have just gone through this with Obama. That isn't a criticism of Obama. I believe he had all the right intentions with his Hope and Change. It's a lot harder to actually implement that change as he and all of us have learned.  There is no substance to Warren's rhetoric. There are no solutions. Anyone can over-simplify and say what people want to hear.

It's not the strongest way to attack her, sure, but there's nothing wrong with bringing it up as a flaw in her character just as many liberals brought up any number of problems (or perceived problems) with Romney's character, for example. In fact, people brought up far more ridiculous things for him (the ""dog on the roof of the car when he was younger"" story, the fact that he has a couple of Cadillacs, the car elevator, etc...).

These aren't nebulous promises, they take the very real form of proposed bills in the Senate. Elizabeth Warren doesn't need to play games to keep her seat in Massachusetts. If she ends up running for President, I could see a lot more motive to deceive with platitudes, but as it stands these quotes are only vague because specific policy propositions don't make for particularly rousing quotations.  e: Look, I'm not the most informed guy on politics, to say the least. I'd love someone, maybe one of the people downvoting me, to tell me how I'm wrong. Because from here it looks like it's just cynicism fueling this criticism of Sen.

The case you're citing, Warren was representing Travelers to make sure that other insurers couldn't sue them for additional settlements. Let that sink in for a minute. She was trying to help an insurer avoid legitimate claims through other carriers so that the victims got screwed.  And the money that was set aside through bankruptcy court for the asbestos maker that travelers had a legal obligation to pay  is now no longer required after warrens involvement.  http://legalinsurrection.com/2012/10/elizabeth-warren-held-asbestos-workers-hostage-to-inter-corporate-fight/"

And it was reasonable to expect the case would not be won and that the trust fund would not have to pay a dime to current victims. And this is exactly what happened. Victims left out in the cold. Why did she do it?  For the $212K in legal fees.

Whether or not that's a good idea is an important question, but it's stupid to assume that the ratio of defensive spending is a blight on America and a compliment to other countries.

Accept that life is better with universal healthcare and the US does not have the most affordable tertiary education.   I am a 22 y.o who has asthma, allergies and eczema and I cannot picture living somewhere that does not have universal healthcare. General doctor visits are free. Xray for a broken toe was free. triweekly UV light therapy for my skin was free. Almost all drugs are subsidised.  As a full time tertiary student I get paid $280/2weeks and $2200/year for studying full time. It is about $8000/year in school fees for engineering so if I used all the money the government gave me to pay for a 4 year degree, university would be free + I would $6000 left over.

If you want to divert tax money from defense to healthcare at the government level, then you are effectively killing a multi-billion dollar a year industry. Thats not going to happen and politicians know this. When they say stuff like this they are using your emotions to control you.  Second, childhood poverty. What's the answer? Raise minimum wage? That will only increase inflation rates and raises taxes. It has no tie to the 600 billion going towards defense spending. It's a mcGuffin and income levels are in no way caused by tax rates. Impoverished people rarely have any tax liability to begin with.  The only thing that even remotely could be considered would be adjustment to education subsidies. Even then, it would only be a fraction of the spending. Most lower and middle class people can go for very little money out of pocket. Of course, this isn't for top tier colleges or going after mostly useless degrees, but it can be done.  Everything about this quote falls apart under even the most basic critical thinking."

I don't know what to do about poor people having babies, though. I'll keep my personal thoughts on eugenics on the inside, but the realistic solution there is, what, continue increasing benefits for lower class families for each dependent in their family?

QuotesPorn,3663oq,ProcastnationStation,6,Sat May 16 17:36:37 2015 UTC,"So every other country in the western world has it pretty much where it operates much better than it does here, but they're wrong?

And yeah, make birth control free for everyone who wants it, and increase the size of the welfare state, everyone else has it and it works well.

QuotesPorn,3663oq,ProcastnationStation,6,Sat May 16 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"Even if socialized medicine were not the right move for this country, that does not justify wasteful spending on our military. You want to reject the point that spending on the military is wrong, by arguing that the alternative, spending that money on healthcare, is wrong. That is a logical fallacy.   Do you support a bloated defense budget in the first place? Or do you think it is not bloated?"
QuotesPorn,3663oq,TheBulgarSlayer,2,Sat May 16 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"National defense is a federal prerogative. Individual healthcare is a private prerogative. It is the federal government's responsibility to ensure the defense of the nation. It is an individual's responsibility to ensure the health of himself and his dependents, and not the federal government's responsibility to aid them in doing so. If an individual state chooses to prioritize improving the health of its citizens, thats their choice.  Is $600 billion bloated? That depends; are they capable of funding all other programs that the federal government is responsible? Are they adequately using that budget to improve the country's defense? Are we seeing true innovation stem from the amount spent on R&D efforts? If the answer is ""yes"" to all of those questions, then $600B could be argued as not particularly bloated. Is there room for reduction? Probably.   Not a particularly popular opinion, but there it is."
QuotesPorn,3663oq,Mast3r0fPip3ts,2,Sat May 16 19:00:24 2015 UTC,A fine point.
QuotesPorn,3663oq,TheBulgarSlayer,-2,Sat May 16 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"Individual healthcare is a private prerogative.   And here is where you're fundamentally wrong. This would be true if, for whatever reason, the health of each individual only affected that person. It doesn't.   And it is bloated by all means. We are overkilling the amount of defense that is needed to adequately defend ourselves and be active members of our coalitions. We could cut our budget in half and still be by far the largest spender in the world, and yet we choose to spend billions on programs that the country doesn't need and then have half of our population bitch about the million per year we give to public radio. It's idiotic and irresponsible"
QuotesPorn,3663oq,AcrossTheUniverse2,1 point,Sat May 16 19:34:38 2015 UTC,"We'll have to fundamentally disagree. I'm not interested in comparing our defense spending to that other nations. I'm interested in the federal government performing one of its primary functions adequately. It may not require a full $600B, but I'm certainly not interested in cutting it in half for the sake of paying for people incapable of managing their own healthcare on their own budget.  We can sit all day and say ""nuh-uh"" to one another, but I strongly believe that it is not the function of the federal government to pay for the healthcare of its citizens."
