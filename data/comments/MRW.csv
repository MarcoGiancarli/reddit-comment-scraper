MRW,38ic07,Canahedo,2,Thu Jun 4 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"Bruce Jenner was an Olympian (...) She hasn't done anything noteworthy other than that and it's just someone being famous for being famous.    Pretty sure being famous for being an Olympic champion and a successful and celebrated athlete makes her pretty much the only one in that family that's not ""famous for being famous""...

Memorials of article  Armenian Genocide:       Over 135 memorials, spread across 25 countries, commemorate the Armenian Genocide.   In 1965, the 50th anniversary of the genocide, a 24-hour mass protest was initiated in Yerevan demanding recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Soviet authorities. The memorial was completed two years later, at Tsitsernakaberd above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan. The 44 metres (144 ft) stele symbolizes the national rebirth of Armenians. Twelve slabs are positioned in a circle, representing 12 lost provinces in present day Turkey. At the center of the circle there is an eternal flame. Each 24 April, hundreds of thousands of people walk to the genocide monument and lay flowers around the eternal flame.  Another memorial, in Alfortville, France, near Paris, was bombed on 3 May 1984, by a hit-team headed by Grey Wolves member Abdullah Çatlı and paid by the Turkish intelligence agency (MİT).

The parents of this girl hired a privet investigator that later arrested him and he spent a week in jail. I think this is absolutely ludicrous considering he never even took physical action and it seemed to be mutual. He got REALLY fucked up from the whole situation. I recommend checking out his channel it's pretty interesting. His name is Bashurverse."

She is a server so she understands that mistakes happen. When I called back I politely described the situation and was told to come back in so they could fix the problem.  No big deal.  When I got in there they offered to comp the meal (I did not ask for it to be comped, I was willing to pay). I simply asked that they make fresh food because it had been 45 minutes since leaving the first time and getting back there.  The manager went back to the kitchen (10 feet away) stating ""Now I have to deal with this asshole after that other guy"" and proceeded to call me an asshole for 10 minutes while they made my ""fresh food"". I then saw her pull my food out of the microwave (eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc). I confronted her about calling me an asshole which she tried to deny. I told her ""I am not one to cause a scene, but do you want to know what a real asshole would do?""  I opened up the cinnamon pancakes and dumped them on the cash register."
