Mommit,3e3k7b,sidzap,28,Tue Jul 21 18:08:58 2015 UTC,It's okay if maternity leave is awful and you feel better at work. People are generally paid to do what they do best. You are really good at your job and they pay you. You pay someone to teach your kid things because they are really good at it. You child will still learn plenty from you.
Mommit,3e3k7b,OrganizedSprinkles,8,Tue Jul 21 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this.  While I wouldn't say my maternity leave is awful, it has definitely been a challenge for me to feel ""productive"" every day, even though I am loving on a tiny human all day (which is no small feat!). It is also incredibly lonely, and I am not a ""sitter,"" so nursing every couple of hours has really taken a toll on me there.  I feel guilty to be excited to go back to work (and really scared to do it on so little sleep!), and it is a really weird feeling because I know I will miss my little girl like crazy!"
Mommit,3e3k7b,MrsCrapnapkin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"100% agree. I decided to take 10 weeks of maternity leave, figuring I would want to spend as much time with baby as I could. Turns out I went back to work a week early because I couldn't stand being home trapped with a tiny human all day. I felt much more ""myself"" when I was at work. I may hate my job, but I would be a terrible SAHM. In fact my husband is the one who stays home with her now.   Also want to stress- Post Partum Depression can manifest in so many ways. You can feel overwhelmed, constantly emotional, angry, irritable, and so much more. It is perfectly ok to ask for help when you need it. It doesn't matter if it is asking for help from your husband, family members, or neighbors. It can include talking to your doctor about what you are feeling. If you feel like you are experiencing it before your 6 week follow up, call your doctor. Don't wait, because lots of medicines take 6-8 weeks to feel the full effect. Get on meds ASAP. I didn't and I felt like I had the first couple of months were robbed from me because I wasn't myself.   Along the same lines, if you need to take any medicine while pregnant or breastfeeding, reach out to the team at infantrisk.com. They have done the most comprehensive research on what medicines pass through to baby. A lot of doctors will tell you that there is nothing they can give you since you are pregnant, but they err to the side of caution and not research.   Congrats on your pregnancy. Hope you have a happy, healthy pregnancy and a quick labor."
Mommit,3e3k7b,MamaD_Cooks,18,Tue Jul 21 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"You are NOT a bad person if you need a minute to compose yourself. If the little one has been screaming their heads off for the last three hours, and you are at a loss on what to do, place the baby somewhere safe, leave the room, and take a minute."
Mommit,3e3k7b,kellaorion,6,Tue Jul 21 18:18:02 2015 UTC,Also when you get back to work go easy on yourself. I had to take a few breaks to cry because I missed my baby so much.
Mommit,3e3k7b,Hydrangeas0813,13,Tue Jul 21 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"I found that I made a lot of plans while pregnant - things like, baby will sleep in the bassinet, we'll use brand X bottles, etc. I forgot that the baby would have some input to give in all of this, and had to learn to be very flexible and understand that plans can change.   That and prepare to have lots of sweets. I lived for those 2am brownies or cookies or tiny cups of ice cream to get through the cluster feeding and exhaustion that came with it."
Mommit,3e3k7b,anniczka,10,Tue Jul 21 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"Trust your gut. If someone gives you a piece of advice and it doesn't work for your kid or it just doesn't seem sane, try something else. You will be amazed at how well you can figure out your own kid."
Mommit,3e3k7b,ninzga,5,Tue Jul 21 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!!  There is r/babybumps and r/workingparents.   But first thing: hormones are a bitch!! Everything changes. Everything. Your body, memory, taste, smell, sex drive...every thing about you changes.  Don't ever feel guilty about putting yourself first. Work will always be there.  I couldn't remember anything. I had to carry a notebook around with me to write down everything. Everything to ask or talk about with the doctors, work, to-do lists...  Once people find out you're pregnant, you have no personal space. This drove me crazy! People, stangers, would come up and pinch, poke, rub my belly. It's ok snap at these people and put them in their place!   Also, everyone will become an overnight expert not only in OBGYN matters, but in patenting and your life as well. Especially people with no kids. They seem to always know more about what you're going through....don't hesitate to block these people out.  Don't be afraid to ask for help. You'll be so exhausted, you can't do it all. The most important thing is taking as best care of yourself for your baby. A body pillow helped me tons to stay comfortable at night.  Find a doctor you are comfortable with. Don't ever Google symptoms...this will stress and freak you out. I was lucky enough to have a doctor that had a 24 hour call and online chat. Saved me and my husband tons of stress!  Don't allow yourself to get constipated. Pregnancy is hard enough already, hemorrhoids and constipation pain will only add to discomfort and worry.  Take a tour of the birthing place before hand. Ask everything. What should you bring, what's provided, how are you billed, what's on the menu, what do you have for spouse to sleep on, how does the nursery staff run (of you choose to have your baby there at all).   We were hit with unexpected charges, for example, the only pediatrician on duty when my daughter was born was a specialist in some field. So we were charged an extra fee for the specialist to see her even though  she did not require the specialist.   Knowing exactly how they bill you, will help you plan ahead to save money if need be.  And there will be times where you will cry, have doubts about the whole thing and that's ok. Just make sure you talk to your partner and doctors so they can help watch for depression.  Everything you will go through will all be with it once you get that little one in your arms.  Hope this helps. Congrats again!"
Mommit,3e3k7b,twoob,5,Tue Jul 21 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"Breastfeeding can be really hard, I say this as someone who breastfed for 17 mths with my first and 2.5 yrs with my second.  Don't be rough on yourself if it isn't unicorns and magic.  Also don't feel like you can't supplement or even give up.  Your boobs, your baby, feed them in the manner that works well for you.    For the love of god hire a person to clean your house.  Hire them now, keep them forever.  The saddest part of going from a working mom to a stay at home mom is having to clean my house again.  I fought it for a year with my first and want to kick myself for all the time I wasted on the weekends when I could have been relaxing with the baby and not hating my husband because I was scrubbing floors.  If chore allocation is going to switch when the baby comes start now.  It is easier to deal with your husband coming home with $150 in junk food and nothing for dinner now then it will be the first time he does it when you have had .3 hrs of sleep for the week.    Babies are hard, there are like mini terrorists that specialize in sleep deprivation.  Anyone who hasn't slept will feel crazy and teary and bipolar, add delivery to that and remember to go easy on yourself.    It gets easier at 2 weeks then 2 months.  Get nightlights that go on automatically when it gets dark for rooms you will be haunting at night.  No one wants to flip on a 180W bulb at 3am to change a diaper or peep on a baby."

No one wants to flip on a 180W bulb at 3am to change a diaper or peep on a baby.   So much this. Especially for all the middle of the night pee stops. It helps you get back to sleep.
Mommit,3e3k7b,Hydrangeas0813,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:31 2015 UTC,"Utilize your network, and have a support system in place. When people offer help - take it. I am a working career mom and it's hard for me to accept help, but even though I can do anything, I can't do everything, especially when I (your wife) is focusing 100% of her energy on the baby. If people offer to make meals pick up groceries, or clean your house, accept it and pay them in baby snuggles :)   Practically? We swaddled to help the baby sleep. I guess it depends on what kind of questions your wife has. She is free to PM but just general advice is hard bc I think, well I have advice if you want to breastfeed, if you want to pump, if you want to cosleep or if the baby will sleep by themself.   For me, I had to go back to work after 6 weeks. It was really hard but I felt like I retained my sense of self. I go to the gym regularly and have girls nights, and date nights. Some people build their lives around their kid but my husband and I for the most part fit our baby into our lives and as a result we get out much more, are more social, and feel like we're not bound to the home with a baby. It depends on what you and your wife's personalities are. Some people love being homebodies, and that works for them. But if she's a working woman I'm assuming she's somewhat independent and will probably get cabin fever after a few weeks.   This is all terribly general but like I said, fee free to respond or PM with more specific questions, if you're looking for brand or baby supply reviews I'm here!"
Mommit,3e3k7b,neonwaves,4,Tue Jul 21 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"People LOVE watching newborns. It might kill you inside...but take advantage of the occasional potential date night and leave your itty-bitty with someone you trust. Go to a movie with your love and make out in the back row.  Oh, and use nursing pads and wash bras daily. That shizz stinks."
Mommit,3e3k7b,maibie,4,Tue Jul 21 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your baby!  32 year old working mom here!  Sign up for emails from Lucie's List, that has been the best website for us!  As far as pregnancy goes, don't stress too much!  It's not like the movies when you go into labor and 5 seconds later a baby pops out.  You have time once you start contractions.  Husband, if your wife asks for help, listen & do!  Pay attention to blood pressure & swelling during pregnancy.  Take your prenatals (look for that folic acid & DHA).  Drink lots of water.  Interview pediatricians and go with your gut.  Postpartum: You'll be a bloody mess, stock up on granny panties and huge pads from 7th grade.  You will need nursing bras if you plan on breastfeeding.  Bravado makes some pretty comfy ones!  Go for washable nursing pads, the disposable ones move around and crinkle.  If you deliver vaginally, the sitz bath is your best friend!  ...As far as work is concerned, kudos to you for being a working mom!  Life itself will seem chaotic, don't be too hard on yourself.  If you can afford a housekeeper, it's worth every penny!  If you decide to pump at work, buy an extra set of pump parts - and husband, help her out washing all those silly parts!  My favorite piece of furniture has been the changing table.  Breastfeeding can make your back hurt, and the changing table is the perfect height that doesn't require me bending over.  Good luck!!!!  PM me with any questions, we're first time parents, little man born this past March.  We'll be happy to listen & share!"
Mommit,3e3k7b,eastwoodhs,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:21 2015 UTC,I second the granny panties and pads!! No one told me how much of a mess a few weeks after birth is! Think of it as all those periods you missed out on all those months coming out at once!

Mommit,3e3k7b,eastwoodhs,3,Tue Jul 21 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention, make an appointment with your HR dept (both parents) find out exactly what your leave covers. How long, how much pay, do you have to use vacation time, sick time, when will it kick in....and see if dad gets any leave.  Also see if you can take leave a week  before baby if you can. That'll give you and partner some last time alone, time to get any last min things done.   I highly suggest doing shopping and stocking up as much as you can. Also cooking things that you can freeze then warm up as needed like lasagna.  And after baby, don't be afraid to ask people to bring food when they come visit. Rotisserie chickens, subs, finger foods...anything."
Mommit,3e3k7b,twoob,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"There are very different schools of thought on the best way to raise a child. Likely people in your life will try to convince you that you should follow one practice or another.  However, every baby is unique and what works for one doesn't work for another and you are going to know your baby better than anyone else. Sometimes people will have valuable advice, but do what feels right for your child and your family."

I was super organized and had a thoughtful outline in place of how to handle my workload during maternity leave.   i also knew that there were some things I wanted to change. I was able to address all of my boss' concerns AND get a transfer to an office in a cheaper area. As a result, hubs can stay home and take care of kiddo!   So if possible, think about your ideal plan and sketch out what that. would look like. And don't be afraid to ask for it!!"
Mommit,3e3k7b,TomahawkDump,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Breath.  Its ok to be scared of giving birth. I was scared both times. Your body knows what to do and will take over when its time. Before you know it your baby will be in your arms and all the pain goes away, promise. When i was in labor with my first i asked the nurse why anyone would have more than one kid knowing how bad it hurts. Afterwards, when i was holding my girl for the first time I looked at her and said ""I understand now"". :)   All that fades away.   Also...if you have a boy...nobody told me but boys get boners even as babies!! It freaked me out at first. Just a heads up on that one!!! Lol.  Congrats to you both!! Good luck, and remember to trust your instincts they will normally guide you right. :)"
Mommit,3e3k7b,dimera1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:16 2015 UTC,Be prepared for the possibility that you will not want to return to work. I was so career driven and planned to return 7 weeks after baby was born. I ended up waiting until she was 10 weeks to go back and it was SO hard. They say it gets better but she's 4 months old now and every single day I still wish I didn't have to work. And I never once thought I'd want to be a SAHM!
Mommit,3e3k7b,criistaaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  Mom of two rambunctious boys here (now 6 and 3).  First off, everyone has advice to give, and I have found that grandmothers can be the worst when it comes to unsolicited advice.  My mom always has something to say about my parenting.  I try my best to grin and bear it, but sometimes I have to remind her that I am the parent and sometimes what I say goes.  Personally, I always thought the baby stage was easier.  For me, I felt that I didn't have to dictate as much.  By the time both my boys reached around three years old, I felt like the only words that came from my mouth were ""Stop that!  Put that down!  Don't run through my house!  Get back here! Hold my hand through the parking lot!  Don't hit your brother!  I told you to put away your toys!"" and the list goes on... maybe because my older son has ADHD combined with ODD and the other one is, well, 3 I feel like a drill sergeant all the time.  It can be hard to remember that its just nice to enjoy the happy moments.  Like when I worked second shift, we used to have picnics on my days off.  We would sit in the ""movie theater"" (living room), dark and quiet with a big comforter on the floor, pizza, popcorn, and juice all sprawled out for us to just dig into all day.  We would do nothing but watch movies and eat.  It can be hard to make good simple memories when life is busy, but those little things will do will always mean more than the 5 minute lecture you gave on proper dental hygiene.  Hold on to those memories, they are the most precious.  Finally, don't feel bad if you don't live through the eyes of your camera lens.  I don't take a lot of pictures of my kids, while my sister seems to take a new picture every few seconds.  Like I said, life gets busy.  Its not a contest, its your life, so just enjoy living it.  And those few pictures you get a moment to take, they will be like gold in a treasure chest.  Again, Congratulations!!  Don't stress, they grow so fast!"

It's okay if your baby has boogers on their face. Before the baby is born you will be exhausted, nap as much as you want. It's a matter of just surviving after the baby is born. You can not do everything. You cannot be the best mom in the world, the best employee, and the best wife. You can be the best you can be in that moment.

There's enough of that in the world already.   It's a beautiful article about all we want our children to be and how we hope to shape them into those people and all the potential we see in our LOs all the time.

You can probably talk to a nurse about your child's symptoms and they can advise you to come in if needed.   In general, a fever of 104°F, lethargy (no eye contact, unresponsive), high fever with vomiting and headache or stiff neck would be reasons to see a doctor.  Several days of low fever but still eating/drinking/interacting is probably OK, but if it lingers more than 3 or 4 days, you'd want to call the doctor.   If you aren't absolutely sure, call your doctor's office and see what they suggest!!!!"

Mommit,3e43zt,eastwoodhs,8,Tue Jul 21 20:46:33 2015 UTC,"Call your pediatrician's office not the nurse hotline from your insurance.  9 times out of 10, the insurance Nurse hotline will always tell you to go to the ER (that's been our experience).  We call the pediatrician, they have a nurse on staff that returns calls.  She will tell us whether to go in or not or if we can treat at home or if it needs to go to the ER.    Also, monitor baby diapers.  How long has it been since baby peed or pooped?  What's the color & consistency of their stools?"

Mommit,3e43zt,Doththecrocodile,3,Tue Jul 21 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I let WebMD be my guide. Figure out temperature and a list of symptoms and browse. Take it with a grain of salt since serious illnesses often share symptoms with very common ones. If kid is sleeping, not dehydrated, not lethargic all day, has a temp, but not scary high (that bar changes depending how young kid is), they'll prob be fine.   When I can't crack what's wrong with my kid via the Internet (or it seems hard to say), I call my pediatrician. Often, just waiting half a day and letting them rest often improves things. If your Ped doesn't offer nurse advice over phone (usually same thing as WebMD- list symptoms and they'll tell you to come in or monitor and wait), find one that does! It's a worthwhile service that every parent needs at some point.   Hope he feels better soon!"
Mommit,3e43zt,seaweed88,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I learned the hard way that if you have ANY doubt, take the kid to the doctor. My now 13 yr old nearly died of a severe asthma attack when she was 4. At first I didn't even recognize the symptoms because she was so bad she wasn't wheezing because her bronchial pathways were so constricted.   Had I not been an idiot and taken her to the dr the 1 or 2 times I'd heard wheezing when she was younger I would have realized what I was dealing with. Instead she spent a week in ICU and another week in the children's ward. I'm haunted to this day by what might have happened.  So, generally speaking, I would always take a child to the dr for:    a fever of 103 or over, even if it responds to meds any kind of strange rash any kind of breathing issue- remember when breathing is severely compromised you will no longer hear wheezing stomach heaving in and out when breathing child complaining of pain if in doubt, go to the dr!   if your partner doesn't want to deal with the drs office then take your child yourself."

When my son was 3 weeks old, he has some weeping from his belly button (his umbilical stump fell off at 12 days) and he seemed lethargic and cranky to me, which was NOT typical. I called his pediatricians office twice and was told it was normal for newborns to sleep a lot and some belly button drainage was normal and that my baby was fine. I just had this nagging feeling that something was wrong, and finally insisted on taking him in to be seen. The pediatrician took one look, said ""that's not normal"", and had him admitted on he spot. Turns out he had a cyst between his belly button and his bladder (urchal cyst) and the cyst had a staph infection. We spent 4 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics and there was talk of surgery, but thankfully the cyst went away on it's own. If I hadn't trusted my gut, my son would have most likely died."
Mommit,3e43zt,Wesa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"Usually you can tell something isn't right and beyond just being sick.  I didn't take my first in for anything other than a scheduled check up until she was 18 months old and had croup while I was visiting family in another state. It was obvious that she was more than just sick with a cold.  She was wheezing and gasping for air that night, and ran a high fever.  Didn't have to take her back in again until she slipped and fell in our kitchen, then complained her head hurt and started vomiting.  It was the vomiting that decided me. 2 weeks later, a dislocated elbow (an hour of not letting us touch her and screaming when we did).  My 2nd went in at 8 months with parainfluenza and croup...gasping for air, wheezing, etc.  Super scary that time (much worse than when his sister had it at 18 months).  That was after he had some stomach bug thing that made him have diarrhea and vomiting for 6 days.  Most of those were urgent care/ER visits.  It's always worth a phone call, though if it's at night, they typically tell you to go to urgent care or the ER."

I have a seven month old and a toddler, and I have a 45 minute car ride to and from school/work.  There are some days when I question my life decisions. Kids can make you feel emotions and pains and love in a way you've never felt before.  Moving on to number three: what have you tried? Is baby breast fed or formula fed? Have you ruled out gas or reflux? Also, what about a pacifier?"
Mommit,3e54uw,lagwagongirl33,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:16 2015 UTC,"She is exclusively breastfed. Tried to feed her, and she wouldn't stay on. Same with pacifier -- she just kept spitting it out. I held her skin to skin for a while, but she just kept screaming in my ear. So I put her down in her swing; it made no difference. Checked her for a fever, nothing. She seems to be having the same bowel movements as ever. How can you tell if it's gas or reflux?   Ughhhh I'm so ready for her to just be able to tell me what's wrong. :/"
Mommit,3e3se1,Sadmama_camp,4,Tue Jul 21 19:04:07 2015 UTC,Just a phase lots of them go through. My eldest did it from 2 to about 3.5. My 2 year old tried it the other day so I am sure he'll make it a regular thing soon.
Mommit,3e3se1,Cayterri,2,Tue Jul 21 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"My son was so into that! His dad thought it was funny until LO threw up spaghetti at supper. A combination of ignoring, taking away objects that would gag him, and gentle 'no's seemed to work over time. They've got limited skills for getting attention, maybe if the attention isn't exciting he'll grow out of it :)"
Mommit,3e3se1,polysepalous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"My son did this for a couple of months. It didn't stop until he made himself throw up one night. It was a lot and all over me, the couch, and he even got the poor dog. I think it kind of scared him and that was the end of that. Wish I had some advice for you but he'll probably grow out of it. It is pretty weird though."

Mommit,3e3oic,_Pandasaurus_,4,Tue Jul 21 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your pregnancy!  I gave birth this past March!  I finished my Master's in December, so I kind of feel like I know a thing or two about school & pregnancy.  I will say this, you should think really hard about attending Spring Semester.  You can give birth before your due date which could be just around mid-terms.  Those last weeks of pregnancy you can be VERY tired!  Plus as much as you plan, you'll likely be setting up the nursery or some other last minute things like that will need your attention.  You'll likely have a baby shower in January to attend.  This is all if pregnancy goes well.  God forbid something terrible happen and you're put on bed-rest and can't attend classes, then what will happen?  ...And AFTER baby arrives you'll be bleeding for quite some time (more than a period), you may have night sweats, and if you choose to breastfeed there may be complications with that such as mastitis.  I say this because I wasn't prepared for they physical aftermath.  I tore slightly and so when you pee you have to clean yourself with a squirt bottle, and I was spraying numbing spray down in my lady bits.  Sometimes it hurt to sit at certain angles.  I wore these huge pads and still managed to stain some clothes.  I got mastitis which was terrible.  ...I don't think I could've gone to school online and much less in person right after giving birth.  I did return to work after 6 weeks though, so I think you'd be in good shape for a Maymester or summer school.  It's not ideal, you'll likely miss your baby, but it is doable.  IMO, skip Spring Semester and take care of yourself and that baby of yours, there's so many variables."
Mommit,3e3oic,eastwoodhs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! That makes things much more clear than just, ""Don't do it. You'll be tired.""  It really is unfortunate though. The way things were going as a full time student, my last semester would be Fall 2016 and then I was moving out of state....which means I'm going to have to now transfer classes to a new school. Ugh. :("
Mommit,3e3oic,eastwoodhs,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everyone will coach you through labor, but they kind of forget about the aftermath of labor (at least I feel like I didn't get educated much on that).  Is there any possibility of transferring to the out of state place, early, should they offer some classes online?  That way you're not sitting around summer and fall at your current school?  Online classes might work better for a new mommy.  If your graduation date is pushed out, it's not the end of the world, I promise.  :)"
Mommit,3e3oic,piratespit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think the extra hassle of moving the classes to a new school will be worth removing that stress from the last half of your pregnancy. Just enjoy it, it goes by quicker than you think!"
Mommit,3e3oic,snarklepop,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"I started grad school 6 weeks after my baby was born. I know two women who had babies and were back at school 10 days later.   Things we had in common: we all really, really wanted to be there. We all had local support networks (spouses, family, etc) who could take on a lot of the baby care duties.  It can be done. It will not be easy so you will need help!   Also, talk to your academic advisor to put together a plan and work with your teachers that semester so you can still get your work done."
Mommit,3e3oic,unclegrassass,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"I gave birth the day before graduation; going to school while hugely pregnant was really horrible. I pretty much just showed up to class and did the minimum to pass. I was really tired, extremely uncomfortable, and had no ability to focus. I had an ideal birth, only had a small second degree tear and no complications. If I would have tried to go back to school immediately after I would not be here today. I would have hauled myself off to the woods and performed a mercy suicide.   Not only are you going to be hurting from giving birth you are going to be completely exhausted. Your baby will probably be up every 2-3 hours for the first two weeks. If you plan to breastfeed that means you will be too. You will also be extremely hormonal; I spent most of the first two weeks crying while feeding my kids.   I really strongly urge you to take a semester off. I have one online class I have to finish up and I've only now had the motivation and energy to begin working on it again, 10 weeks after my kids were born."
Mommit,3e3oic,DarthLeia2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"I'll give you my experiences. I had my second and third children while in college. My second child was born over winter break. His c-section went flawlessly and I had 2 weeks before classes started, so it was no problem going back to classes. Sure, I was tired, but that's it. I didn't breastfeed, so my husband and I always shared nighttime duties.  My third child was not so easy. He was born this past March. His c-section did not go flawlessly. I ended up back in the hospital due to complications. Once I got back out after 3 days, I had a couple medical devices attached for a couple weeks. Luckily, I only had one class but I missed two weeks of it. My senior project group was amazing and understanding. They let me work as little or as much as I could during that time. After all my medical drama, though, I was glad to have class to get my mind off of it.   I had little difficulty giving birth twice while in college (complications notwithstanding). I was really glad to have something adult to put my mind to while on medical leave from work. I'm not cut out to just be at home with kids. Classes gave me somewhere to go without the kids for a few hours of week. It would not have been possible without the support of my husband, though.   So, that was my experience. I can't say if you should or should not do it. It depends on your personality and what you think you can handle."
Mommit,3e1jf5,MomSaysNo,10,Tue Jul 21 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"Let the lifeguard or pool attendant know right away. There's basically nothing else you can do, other than obviously get the kid out of the pool immediately."

Mommit,3e0n3w,Jibberis,7,Tue Jul 21 01:20:59 2015 UTC,"I use the Chicco Echo stroller, which you can get at Target for around $80, I think. I'm not sure it technically qualifies as an umbrella stroller, but it is very lightweight, easy to maneuver, and it lays flat for naps. It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I quite like it. Bonus: the handles are high enough that I don't feel like I'm stooping over trying to push it (I'm quite tall).  Quick edit: Apparently it's $100, but I definitely didn't pay that much for it. Wait for it to go on sale."

Mommit,3dzmfo,cornogirl,11,Mon Jul 20 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, totally roll with it. He's telling you what he needs and a three-hour nap that doesn't interfere with nighttime sleep is just fine at that age. Is he sleeping 10-ish hours at night? (It doesn't need to be straight through.)"
Mommit,3dzmfo,fuss_bucket,3,Mon Jul 20 23:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, he usually sleeps from 7:30pm-6ish am. His typically naps are fairly short, and hour and a half on average, so I'm excited about consolidating into one long nap."
Mommit,3dzmfo,ggkimmiegal,6,Tue Jul 21 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"10 months. I was convinced it was way too early because of everything I read here and on the Internet. I spent an entire month trying to put him down for two naps a day.  He would take a short one, and then be fussy by dinner time after refusing the 2nd. As soon as I switched him to 1 nap a day after lunch, life became better for everyone."
Mommit,3dzmfo,Ocipura,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"That's interesting because we are at almost 10 months and staying to have nap issues, but I've read that babies keep 2 naps till closer to 15-18 months! We keep having said with two short naps and then bedtime meltdowns. On good days, he takes two 1.3 hr naps, or one 2 hr and one 1 hr nap. I've been starting to wonder if he needs to transition a lot earlier than I read"
Mommit,3dzmfo,thepriceforciv,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"To add a different perspective--my one year old did this for one week and then went back to taking two naps.  When she had a 1 nap day, we just put her to bed early and then tried the 2 nap schedule again the next day.  She skips about 1 nap a week now, but she still definitely needs 2 naps most days.  Every kid is different, but most kids don't outgrow 2 naps until 15-18 months.    Edited to add:  If the morning nap is getting super long, you can wake them up after 1-1.5 hours to preserve the afternoon nap.  You know your kid, so you know whether or not this is a good idea--it worked for us but would leave other parents with a cranky monster."
Mommit,3dzmfo,tessiegamgee,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"Mine has just now made the transition at 15 months.  He'll sometimes sleep for 15-20 minutes before lunch if we're in the car, but almost always gets in a solid 2 or 3 hours in the afternoon."
Mommit,3dzmfo,dedicednu,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if mine is ready to forego the morning nap completely yet, but the idea of a giant afternoon nap sounds glorious."
Mommit,3dzmfo,clumsyotter,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"My son use to nap twice a day, two hours each. It was very predictable. Like, I could set my watch to that kid's naps. Around nine months both naps shifted to being an hour later in the day and he dropped that afternoon nap altogether, then his morning nap slowly shortened to an hour and a half. He's ten months old now and he occasionally takes that afternoon nap but I don't expect it. So far it hasn't affected how long he sleeps at night, but he has been a little harder to get to sleep."
Mommit,3dzmfo,Force_burgers,3,Tue Jul 21 03:26:25 2015 UTC,Somewhere around 1 year old. Daycare started it so we went with it. We still get long 3 hour naps and she's 2.

Mommit,3dzmfo,MonsoonAndStone,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:53 2015 UTC,Roll with it! When we transitioned to one nap a day our little person started sleeping 12 hours a night. It's glorious!!
Mommit,3dy2ha,5oclock_charlie,8,Mon Jul 20 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can't make them love the things you are into...but you can always get into the things they love!  I think men often bond more through shared experience and activities than women, so just join in with the boys."
Mommit,3dy2ha,KKilljoy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you think your boy will grow up and leave you alone, don't let it happen. I promise you, if you are always there for your son and foster a sense of family, he won't leave you alone.  Sure, you may not have many common interests, but you'll teach him by example that because you love someone, you join in on their hobbies because the important thing is to do things together.  My husband and his mother don't have much in common, but their love is deep and you can totally see them both do things they aren't much interested in because it makes the other one happy.  They strike a balance, and it's beautiful to see.   It takes time, and just keep in mind it won't be 100% fart jokes and wrestling forever.  Most men do eventually grow out of that... For the most part! (Although my husband still makes fart jokes and watches wrestling every week...)  As he grows up, I'm sure you guys will find activities to do together and you will enjoy yourself."
Mommit,3dy2ha,kanooka,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"My husband was trying to say something similar last night in the midst of my sob fest (and I NEVER cry, so it's a little awkward for all involved when it does happen).  He was saying ""They boys will always love you because you're a great mom"", which is sweet and I'd like to believe, but it's like with him and his own mom.  He absolutely loves and respects his mom.  He'd do anything in the world for her.  But does he driver over to go hang out with her just for funsies like I do with my mom?  Not a chance.  (But then his mom and dad travel a lot whereas my mom is a widow, thus has much more free time).  He also said ""My brother and I call mom all the time!"" and I thought ""Actually you call your dad and pray your mom doesn't answer"" (But again, to be fair, once you're on the phone with his mom you're going to be there for a LONG TIME).  I guess it's not good to infer direct parallels based on what she said during my second pregnancy, but dismantling the art center I so excitedly built for him 3 years ago just has me really bummed out."

I always wanted a daughter and I am very close to my mom, and she is also very close with her mom.  I ended up getting pregnant on accident, and of course there was the hope that I'd finally have a daughter.  It's another boy.  My husband is getting a vasectomy and it'll be me in a house of five boys.  It feels so final.  I REALLY want to not care at all, just be happy because my boys are great and I do love them so much.  But I feel so sad too, and then super guilty over the sadness.  And every single time the pregnancy comes up with anyone who knows me, they comment that it's too bad it wasn't a girl.  I smile and try not to show that it's been so hard to get over that.  I don't want anyone to think I'm unhappy with another boy.. I know I'll love him to bits and I'm excited even though he was an unexpected surprise.  I just feel like I'm going to be missing something as well.  I wish it didn't bother me so much."

Mommit,3duyyv,justatwitchiswear,23,Sun Jul 19 18:58:08 2015 UTC,Have you taken him to an ENT to have his hearing checked? My 3yo barely spoke and when he did we couldn't understand him. Turns out his ear drums were barely working because they were surrounded by fluid. He had surgery this past December and is a whole different kid. Doesn't need speech therapy anymore because he can actually hear. (They drained the fluid and inserted tubes to prevent future fluid build up)
Mommit,3duyyv,mamaof2boys,10,Sun Jul 19 19:11:21 2015 UTC,This! Take him in to get his hearing checked. My kiddo had such crud buildup in her ears she could barely hear us speak. Once we got them cleaned (by the dr) she never quit talking!
Mommit,3duyyv,mutantmother,6,Sun Jul 19 19:27:20 2015 UTC,Late talker here! He went into speech therapy at 2 1/2 and could hardly put two words together. At three he aged out and was able to do a string of three words. The speech helped so much. He never would have gotten there on his own. He'll be four in October and now he's doing full on sentences. He probably would have gotten here eventually on his own but it would have taken awhile. It's just not a strength for him. And now there's less meltdowns and misunderstandings. Was your child evaluated before being put into speech? They ruled out hearing problems before we got the go ahead. Id say keep going with the speech but if you feel there are other problems then address it with his dr.
Mommit,3duyyv,Zeblistic,5,Mon Jul 20 05:15:22 2015 UTC,"First step is to get him into the pediatrician for a thorough checkup, including the hearing testing that others are recommending. A lot of the time that's the primary problem.  If the doctor doesn't find a physical cause, ask for a referral to a specialist for further evaluation, and ask how to get early intervention services in your area."
Mommit,3duyyv,jmurphy42,5,Mon Jul 20 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"My daughter will be 3 in december and does not talk, she does babble like your son though. I've had her ears checked and all is fine with that, however her older sister ( 8 in sept) didn't start speaking coherently until she was almost 4. Sometimes kids just take their own pace developmentally, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Definitely look into getting his ears checked just in case, otherwise just keep working with him talking and he should pick it up eventually."

Not being able to do 20 by 18 months could possibly be a problem that the pediatrician can evaluate...

Your regular pediatrician should be able to recommend some to you. They can evaluate him fully for motor and speech problems, then refer you to a different therapist. You can also get evaluated (for free) by your local school system. They can offer services , like having a therapist come to your son's day care/preschool once a week. My 4 year old is in speech therapy now for an expressive speech disorder. Before we got her the help she needed, she had some major behavior problems that stemmed from her frustration at not being able to speak at the same level that she could understand.

I currently have an almost 4 year old who until a couple months ago was completely nonverbal.  To answer your question, no, it is definitely not normal. You should make sure he's evaluated for autism and hearing issues. My kids who were the latest talkers did have some traits of autism but so far the older 2 are pretty functional. One is currently an honors student in high school.  Does you son understand what you say to him? Does he make good eye contact and enjoy engaging with you? Some kids just need extra time. I will warn you that late talkers, IME, need to be red shirted for kindergarten because they're just not up to par with their peers in terms of speech. Both my older late talkers were red shirted and are now doing well in mainstream schools.  HTH."

We are growing so they can tend to be tighter in some places than others and along with already being made of a cheaper jean quality product can be just very unpleasant.   It wasn't until middle school that I realized that after wearing better quality, more expensive non Wal Mart jeans, that I realized they can be ok.   Maybe look into a pair of higher quality jeans when he gets older. This was my solution but it took a long time before I became physically comfortable wearing them."

It also depends on what kinds of CDs you want to use. I never needed more than one insert on a pocket diaper except at night. You may want to try out a few different kinds of diapers to see the what works best for your baby. Good luck!
Mommit,3dtab6,detoxnurse,4,Sun Jul 19 11:27:10 2015 UTC,I recommend about 30. Cuts down on laundry and less wear and tear on your diapers.

We have 18 and do laundry every other night, but I'm not super hardcore about CDing so we use disposables if we run short (and also at night). We also use AIOs so it's as painless as possible.

Mommit,3dtab6,FlissShields,3,Sun Jul 19 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"For a baby of your LO's age they recommend around 20-25 depending on how often you intend to do washing.   There's so many types but if you intend to do either pockets or wraps then you need more than one insert per nappy (I use a minimum of two with pockets) of different types - most come new with just 1 microfibre insert and you boost with hemp, bamboo or charcoal.   I'm working on my stash for #2 but I won't cloth from NB as I suspect it's going to be too tough for those first 2-3 months (it's a high risk pregnancy so I'm happy to take the ""easy"" route til we know everything's okay)"

Mommit,3dqyyz,nikknak,5,Sat Jul 18 16:41:08 2015 UTC,What an ass. I'd recommend you try find a lactation consultant who can help you find gentle ways to transition to a sleeping arrangement that works for you both.   GPs arent sleep specialists and all too often they understand very little of the dynamic behind breatsfeeding.   If you are looking for some reading on sleeping arrangements and gentle transitions for bf moms you could browse through some of the many articles on http://www.evolutionaryparenting.com. when i was being pushed into cry it out methods that website helped me realise why it felt so wtong.
Mommit,3dqyyz,AfroTriffid,6,Sat Jul 18 21:12:14 2015 UTC,"Seriously no, that is a horrible doctor. Yes some babies are sleeping through the night by then, but there are tons that won't sleep through the night until the are 3 or 4 even. It is normal, and seriously at 7 months that is still normal to have her waking throughout the night still. My daughter is 16 months, has cosleeped with me since birth, and she still does 2 bottles a night. I could probably get her to one bottle a night but I enjoy the extra sleep, it's really nice when i can get it cause I don't get naps like she does. Also 7 month olds do not need pacifiers! Worst advice ever! They are supposed to not use them past 6 months as it can cause dental issues.  It honestly sounds like she is a normal little girl. Though hopefully you can get a better doctor to talk to about her reflux, the other doctor just dismissing it was rude. If you are okay with keeping her in bed with you she will probably still nurse a couple of times a night. I don't breastfeed but my sister did and her son was still waking in the middle of the night until she sleep trained him in a crib, which yes it is hard.  From what I remember she started out with placing her son's crib mattress on the floor by her bed and would lay with him there and nurse him until he fell asleep. I think he was better sleeping in his own away from her, but I would have to ask as it has been a few months. She managed to get him in his crib though but he will only go to sleep with all of the lights off and no noise at all.  Also not a good idea to try to sleep train into a crib right now if you are going to have her back in your bed again, as you will have to redo sleep training when you get home.  I don't even know if I am saying half of this right."
Mommit,3dqyyz,BrittBrat893,3,Sat Jul 18 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"I don't cosleep so don't have much advice on that, but your doctor sounds like a jerk.  In my experience, good doctors can give you advice on sleep training or nursing but what they say is not the final word.  It's YOUR baby and you should do what feels right.  There's no one right way to parent.  If you don't want to use CIO, then don't, at least not right off the bat. It's not the only option.  I've heard amazing things about the book Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child if you wanted to look into something else. I also think if you're going away for a month and your daughter will be sleeping with you during that time, I would wait to try to make any big transitions until you get back home.  Why make everyone miserable for a week or more if you're just going to have to change it up again.  When you get back you can start working on new routines. Sorry, didn't really have any advice there, I just hate that your dr is making you feel bad when you're doing nothing wrong."
Mommit,3dqyyz,happycow10,6,Sat Jul 18 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Also, just my opinion, I don't think sleeping through the night is normal at seven months either (I don't know if there is such a thing as ""normal"" when it comes to baby sleep!) And if it makes you feel any better, I nursed multiple times a night until my baby was around ten months old, then I worked on weaning out night feedings.  Luckily my kid LOVES her pacifier, so the transition was pretty smooth.  Your daughter just might not be ready to stop yet"
Mommit,3dqyyz,happycow10,2,Sat Jul 18 17:55:37 2015 UTC,"None of my three kids slept through the night until after I nightweaned them at about 10-12 months old. They woke up every 2-3 hours, for that long. With my first two kids, I was kind of a wreck for a while, until they were old enough where I felt comfortable nightweaning them. With the third, I just kind of was so in over my head I didn't have the brain capacity to feel upset about it. It was horrendously exhausting. So sorry, I can't give you any advice there, except the most unhelpful observation that it is a phase and it will pass. For what it's worth, all three sleep pretty great now.  Doctors only know what they've been trained. And unfortunately, many have only been trained that cosleeping = death, regardless of the circumstances. Do what is best for your family while following the safety recommendations. You do make some good points, that you would lose any progress. If it were me in that situation, I'd just tough it out (but that's just me!)"
Mommit,3dqyyz,fujiko_chan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"My daughter didn't sleep through the night until she was 2 1/2. We also coslept until she was 2 maybe? I can't remember. My point is, that Dr. should be ashamed for giving you opinions rather than actual medical advice. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I would talk to another doctor and go from there. Ultimately, though, you are her mother and know her the best. Trust your instincts."
Mommit,3dqyyz,Ishtar3,0,Sun Jul 19 14:17:32 2015 UTC,"Ok so the doctor didn't approach these issues correctly, but she wasn't wrong either.  So let's tackle these issues one at a time.   First, let's talk about the silent reflux. If your daughter were sleeping on her own, I would have to say this probably wouldn't be a problem. At this age she should be able to roll over just fine. She would probably roll over and sleep on her tummy if left to her own devices.  Now, let's talk sleeping through the night. Again, your doctor wasn't wrong. Lots of people have babies that won't sleep through the night due to accidental parenting.  That happens when you ""force"" your child to sleep instead of letting sleep come naturally.  Nursing/walking/rocking to sleep are only a bandaid, and are the cause of a lot of sleep problems.  We sleep trained at 4 months old. Yes I know the websites say 6 months. But I trust my pediatrician more than a bunch of websites that all quote each other.  My pediatrician is a Johns Hopkins doctor who is always telling us about all of the latest and greatest studies. He knows I am a mathematician, and always breaks the numbers down for me.   He explained the 4 month sleep regression is when babies change their sleep patterns to a more adult like pattern. Meaning, yes they can and should be sleeping through the night. Accidental parenting keeps babies and parents up all night when everyone should be sleeping.   There are lots of sleep training methods out there. All of them involve crying to a certain degree. Even the no cry methods involve crying. And why shouldn't they. You are asking your baby to do something they have never done before.  They are going to cry just like when you forced them to do tummy time. Did crying stop you from putting them on their tummy though?    Now let's talk night weaning. Honestly, if you sleep train properly, you won't need to night wean. I had to get up a few times to pump a little the first week after sleep training, but we were done with night feedings. Once my son learned to fall asleep on his own, he decided he would rather sleep all night.  As far as I am concerned, this is only more proof my pediatrician was correct. (I did have to switch my son to a longer lasting diaper at night to eliminate all night wakings).   With sleep training, you have to be consistent. If you aren't, you make your child cry for nothing.  As far as no crib at your parent's, that is what a pack n play is for. I saw 3 of them at my local consignment shop this week."

There is a reason we get 40 weeks to get ready.   I honestly was not happy about being a mother until I was 6 months along with my first. I nearly had an abortion early on, and it took a long time to get OK with things. I had a lot of ambivalent feelings about my second. I'm 31 weeks with my third now, and I haven't really wrapped my head around it all.

Mommit,3dnwfe,MrsAnthropy,3,Sat Jul 18 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'll answer with my experience. My first daughter was a planned, average birth. She was a little cone-headed when she came out, but that's to be expected what with squeezing through the vagina and whatnot. They kept a hat on her, which helped. The day after she was born, I couldn't (and still cannot) believe how cute she was. I know being the parent clouds your judgment, but she was a super-cute newborn.  My second daughter was an emergency c-section. When my husband showed her to me, I was like, ""Bless her heart."" I loved her as much as I had the first one, and she grew out of the goofy-newborn looks and is now an adorable toddler.   Even if you don't think your baby is model good looking you will probably love it regardless.   You're only seven weeks. Lots of weird stuff is going to happen and go through your mind. Rest assured, you're not the first one to have these thoughts. Please just take care of yourself and the peanut."

Each ultrasound helped it build. I had lots of moments of private joy, but I didn't spread them or make them exuberant. I really wanted to retain my identity as an independent person and NOT just a mom/baby carrier.   (people did not react well to this, either -- I didn't give a shit. They'll get over it.)

Afraid, unsure, everything. It's normal I think. And if you like all the science stuff, do some more research...it's freaking amazing how we can grow a human being inside of us!   Good luck and try to enjoy this time."

Mommit,3dnwfe,Snape_meant_well,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:55 2015 UTC,My first one was a cute newborn. My second was 10 pounds 4 oz and ...cute in a much different way
Mommit,3dnwfe,lutheranian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"When my daughter was born, my first reaction to seeing her was, ""She's not as cute as I hoped she'd be."" Really. It wasn't perfect. But once she was firmly in my arms, and I was able to bond with her, I fell madly, deeply, hopelessly in love with her. I hope it is the same for you."
Mommit,3dnwfe,iella_w,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"I have been where you are! Totally called my son a parasite and pissed people off. I really disliked babies. Like, didn't even like holding newborns or understand the hype about them. I was terrified that the responsibility and life change would SUCK and that I would hate being a mother, too. It'll be different when your own baby arrives. Life is totally different, but you're pumped full of so many hormones and you'll be so happy that the baby is FINALLY out that bonding will happen. It took a while before I thought my son was really cute, but I still found his small features and sleepiness to be adorable.   I still don't find other people's babies cute at all though."
Mommit,3dnwfe,iella_w,13,Sat Jul 18 06:22:03 2015 UTC,"I had the same reaction to the heartbeat as you.  Wasn't emotional or anything.  ""That's pretty cool!""  I also had the same fears as you regarding not loving my child.    You may not immediately connect with your baby.  It happens, and it's no big deal.  Motherhood may suck for a while, since the first couple of months your baby eats, poops, sleeps, and cries.  How much he/she does of each depends on your baby.  If you put effort into it and make sure you take care of yourself mentally and take care of the needs of your baby you will get there.  You will probably connect with your child.    I had a small group of 3 friends that I constantly texted with before I was married and then we kept in touch until before I was pregnant and now that my son is 9 months.... we're doing a girls weekend this weekend.  We are still the same.  They love my son, they love seeing pictures and seeing him in person and hearing about him.  We still talk and do all the normal things.  I may not have been able to see them as much as I was able to before, but that's ok.  Things change.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.  However, social development is important for your child and that means interacting with other children.  That may mean chatting with their mothers/fathers/guardians and being polite and listening to their conversations while your child learns to play with other children.  I'm being 100% honest with you here in saying that one aspect of being a mother is giving up some selfishness."
Mommit,3dnwfe,BreckensMama,9,Fri Jul 17 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"Lots of good comments here already about it being normal, etc. but I wanted to key in on your statement about ""losing [your] identity."" This was a big thing for me particularly because I am now a SAHM after working for many years as an engineer. Your identity while pregnant and also post-baby is something worth fighting for. Keep up with your hobbies, make time to go out with friends, read books that interest you and make you think. It's easy to get wrapped up in, ""Baby needs me"" because they really are 24/7 for a long time, but many of the baby's needs can be taken care of by someone else. What the baby REALLY needs is a mother that is emotionally stable, taking care of herself, and is balanced in all aspects."
Mommit,3dnwfe,helgana,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Do people give you a hard time for being a SAHM? I don't see anything wrong with it and will probably be one for awhile, but I'm worried about judgment. I've heard some pretty awful ""nicknames"" for it. I'm just...thinking of the worst case scenario for everything right now, so please forgive my pessimism!"
Mommit,3dnwfe,dogsordiamonds,2,Sat Jul 18 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I've gotten a hard time about it, but I think that mostly depends on the area where you live and whether or not it's common. Basically, what /u/BreckensMama said - ignore all of it. You will have strong instincts about what's right for you and your baby, and those instincts will be correct, rest of the world be damned. Be yourself, be the best mother you know how to be, and at the end of the day you'll be able to look yourself in the eye and be happy with who you are and who your kid is. Who cares what anyone else thinks?"
Mommit,3dnwfe,Lady_Lachrymose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"My two cents: new mommies are the most judgemental crowd you will ever encounter. There are passionate opinions on EVERYTHING and anyone who doesn't agree with one faction's mentality will be judged harshly. Every parent is doing something that is being judged to be wrong, while those judging are being judged for their own choices.  Ignore ALL OF IT. Do what works for you and your baby. Keeping your family healthy and happy and sane is the only thing you need to spend energy on, not some mindless hoard of mommy bloggers and forum trolls.   Most parents outgrow this by the time the kids hit late preschool."
Mommit,3dnwfe,FlissShields,7,Sat Jul 18 04:49:52 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, I know how you feel. We didn't plan on getting pregnant with our first and then one night we made some bad decisions and -woosh- we were in the family way. I think I spent a good hour every night for the first three months just crying in the bathtub because I was so sad (and mad that I was sad and sad about being mad, etc.) I found I struggled most with these weird expectations about how a pregnant woman should feel and act (mostly driven by unfairly comparing myself to my sister-in-law who was very excited about being pregnant and wasn't afraid to let everyone know). Guilt is maybe a good way to describe it, I felt guilty that I wasn't excited and other people were. It took time to become happy about being pregnant but I can't say I was ever over the moon. That little bug is 2 years old now and his 4 month old brother is currently napping next to me and I am nuts (like, 98% of the time) about both of them.  I would really recommend telling your SO about how you're feeling.   It helped me soooo much just talking to my husband about how I felt. He didn't try to ""fix"" me or make me feel excited, he just listened and reminded me that I wasn't going into this thing alone - he was there for me and the baby, too. He was also able to help with that feeling of loosing my identity. Other people would always ask about the baby - ""How's baby today?"" ""I don't know, we haven't had a conversation yet this morning"" - but he would ask about me and how my day was, etc. He waited to talk baby stuff until I brought it up.   Anyway, all this to say, you aren't alone in this and you aren't the only one who has/does/will feel this way. It might take some time to become excited about this baby and you might not get there until you are holding them in your arms, but that is OK. Try not to feel guilty or compare yourself to other moms or an ideal image of a pregnant woman you've set up in your head."
Mommit,3dnwfe,celtlass,4,Fri Jul 17 22:11:45 2015 UTC,I liked babies till I was pregnant then I couldn't care less about other people's kids. I love mine.
Mommit,3dnwfe,forwardseat,5,Fri Jul 17 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"I was getting ready to walk out of the door to go have drinks with the guy I was seeing when I found I was pregnant.  I had just gotten out of a long, awful relationship. I had started seeing this guy only two months before that fateful pee stick. I was 27, lived alone, did what I wanted when I wanted and had never thought about changing that. I only took the test because every once in a while I would stress about being late and it felt like my period wouldn't come until my brain had proof that my body didn't have a parasite. When I saw that plus sign, it was like my world collapsed around me. I was broken. I didn't want a kid, I don't even like kids. I forgot to feed myself sometimes, how the fuck was I supposed to raise a tiny person?! I felt like (and was told be someone who was a close friends) that I ruined The Guys life. I was evil, and did this on purpose.   He calmed me down. I wanted him to leave and he held me and told me he was in this too. He would be there for me and this kid even if I didn't want to be with him in the long run. I kept the baby, even though I was afraid I wouldn't love it. The first trimester was traumatic. A complete lifestyle change, being ostracized by people I loved, and feeling like my body was a vomit covered prison. The second trimester was better, still wasn't comfortable with thought of being someone's parent, and having to deal with a kid. Then I felt him kick, I watched his dad fall in love way before me, and started getting used to being pregnant.  I didn't want a child. Was horrified at the idea of having one. I knew that I would never be able to truly love a needy, smelly creature. And I can tell you now that I am married to my son's father. As cliche as it sounds, I would crawl through hot glass for my son. I love him more than I could imagine was possible.   Sorry for the wall of text. It wasn't easy for me at all, but I wanted you to know that you are not alone in the way you feel. You will be a great mother."
Mommit,3dnwfe,urbanbutter,5,Sat Jul 18 01:57:43 2015 UTC,"You aren't crazy. This is a normal fear.   I never bonded with my baby when I was pregnant with him - I had an anterior placenta and barely EVER felt him kick.  He was then 5 weeks early and I wasn't prepared and I never felt that ""rush of love"" they talked about.   I still never have and he's three now - but I know, KNOW that I love him with all my heart.   I can and have stood in front of a speeding car (mounted the pavement and came straight at us) to protect him and he is my world.   Did I worry? Of course - but I'm not pregnant with #2 and am ready to go through it all again so :hugs: mama you are going to be fine x"
Mommit,3dnwfe,urbanbutter,3,Fri Jul 17 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Being pregnant and having a kid is the biggest, most personal science experiment you will probably ever undertake. The science/technology/biology part of it is awesome!  But 7 weeks is pretty early to fall madly in love with a tiny womb-parasite you can't even see. That comes later.  This American Life has a pretty good podcast about Harry Harlow and his experiments with monkeys and terrycloth mothers - trying to discover if infants need love. (spoiler: they do)  Take it one step at a time, and enjoy the ride."
Mommit,3dnwfe,i_izzie,4,Fri Jul 17 22:59:42 2015 UTC,"There's no way to tell until you get there how it will be for you. But do know that it's totally normal to not be sunshine and roses about it.  Odds totally normal to not feel connected to the baby, too be annoyed at how everyone treats you like a walking incubator. Normal to hate pregnancy even if it's not a hard one. Normal to have the baby and not quite know what to do and not experience some massive flooding rush of immediate love.  I will also add that as an introvert, my biggest problem was not having to interact with other parents, but the feeling of not having my own space, ever.  I breastfed, and he was (is) pretty clingy and wanted to be with me alllll the time.  Having no space for myself, and feeling touched out all the time was really hard.  Prior to having him I had tons of daily me time, focusing on my passions and really directing my own life.  The change was really hard.  But for all that I can tell you having a kid is totally amazing. I love my son with an intensity I never knew existed. No one can say how it will be, but everything you are feeling is completely normal.  And you will be a great mom!  The feelings you are having right now are in no way indicative or predictive of the kind of parent you will be."
Mommit,3dnwfe,i_izzie,4,Fri Jul 17 23:07:15 2015 UTC,The fact that you are worried about it speaks volumes. You are gonna be just fine.
Mommit,3dnwfe,RheaJoan,2,Sat Jul 18 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you. But I'm worried because I've met several mothers/have friends who absolutely hate their lives after having a baby. I thought it would be a ""phrase"" because of how different life is, but nope. Years later they're still bitter and depressed. I'm afraid that will be me."
Mommit,3dnwfe,BreckensMama,5,Sat Jul 18 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"Remember, even with a baby, you choose your fate. You don't have to conform to some cookie-cutter image of a mother. You are still you, and you have to do things just for you."

Mommit,3dnwfe,Dourpuss,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"As a recent new mom, don't worry about a thing. I felt the same way when I found out we were pregnant. I hated babies (more scared of them I guess) and the thought of being a mom at that moment. My husband was being sentimental over everything. Eventually it grew on me and I became more comfortable with the idea.   As for the being an introvert and thinking everyone's an idiot, you are not alone! I dreaded the moms I met at groups and get togethers and yeah some drive me bonkers but I have made a few friends. It's nice having friends who understand. Of course I stayed close with all my friends I just got to have friends I saw once a week who I can laugh with about the funny noises babies make. Being an introvert is easy when it's you and baby. It's like instantly having that other best friend you can tell anything or not talk at all.   Have you talked with your SO about this? At some point I broke down and cried and explained everything to my husband. Sometimes you just need to talk it out. Then they will at least understand how you feel and try to comfort you.   It's scary becoming a parent. But once you are one, it's worth it. My LO is 8 months and I am loving every second. Congrats!!!"

Mommit,3dnwfe,GwenSoul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:32 2015 UTC,But once your child learns how to do all these milestones the bad goes away. My favorite was when she learned to say I love you mommy.

It's okay to feel pretty much all the emotions, good or bad, right now.

Mommit,3dimvd,missnewreddit,8,Thu Jul 16 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"In her first month of life, my daughter managed to projectile-poo on both my mom and my husband, after being told to wait a few minutes to change her, as she would always poo a little, then poo more in 5-10 minutes.  The most impressive was the time she got enough distance to hit two sides of her bassinet, my husband's arm, and four feet away on the floor.  I couldn't stop laughing."
Mommit,3dimvd,genivae,7,Thu Jul 16 17:58:32 2015 UTC,The force with which a newborn poos is really something you only believe once you've witnessed it in person!
Mommit,3dimvd,sweetpea07,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:52 2015 UTC,Yes. I'll never forget the screams as my husband changed our oldest's diaper when she was itty bitty. She launched it across the room. It looked like someone had a food fight with mustard.

Mommit,3djx6i,ElderflowerGin,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:29 2015 UTC,We got the Bob Motion travel system. I haven't had my baby yet so I haven't taken it out into the world much. It does have an adjustable handle bar on it and also a cut out in the basket so you're not kicking it as you walk. Might be worth trying out at Buy Buy Baby.
Mommit,3djx6i,ellmae,2,Thu Jul 16 22:56:37 2015 UTC,"My husband is 6'4 and has no issues with out baby jogger city select. The extendable handle is great fit him and my shirt 5'4 self. As for car seats, out daughters are both very tall, but the britax brand has fit them both very well."
Mommit,3djx6i,FluffKitty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:29:31 2015 UTC,Umbrella strollers have handle extensions you can purchase separately.  I wonder if other strollers have something similar?  Might be worth the google.   Also big wheels on strollers in general is a good way to go.  The bigger the wheel the easier it is to go over bumps and dips during your travels.
Mommit,3djx6i,GreenHatSam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Visit your local baby store and try a few out. If you find one that's comfortable for him but doesn't meet your other requirements, take note of it's measurements and look for something with a similar height while online shopping."

Mommit,3dh03s,kiki_The_blonde,3,Thu Jul 16 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest- 3 months is kinda early. If you're nursing you're just barely getting to the point where your hormones no longer regulate production and it's based on supply/demand. The time away could affect your supply since a pump doesn't get as much milk as a nursing infant does. Perhaps you could ask your boss if you could bring your baby? At 3 months they are pretty happy to just chill and sleep most of the day. If that's not practical, could you ask family to help? It's also totally possible that the time away could be good bonding time for your husband and the baby. Good luck with whatever you decide to do!"
Mommit,3dh03s,Snape_meant_well,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:17:14 2015 UTC,I second the idea of bringing baby and another caregiver with you. I traveled at 4 months for a week and my husband took vacation and stayed at the hotel. We booked a suite so they had lots of room.
Mommit,3dh03s,thepriceforciv,3,Fri Jul 17 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"Can you bring hubby or grandma and the baby with you? They can hang out in a hotel during the day and you can be with baby at night?   This isn't an ideal solution but if your job is in jeopardy, it may work a little better than being away from your newborn for a few days"
Mommit,3dh03s,snarklepop,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"It seems like a trip this early would be difficult for a number of reasons: 1) You'll still be in the process of getting back into the swing of things at work. 2) The daycare routine will take a while to get comfortable with. 3) Your husband doesn't seem like he would be comfortable handling it solo, but, of course, you might be able to get some family help.  I went to a conference when my daughter was about five months. I was only away one full night, but it took a lot of prep to pump enough milk and get her comfortable with bottle. The thing that helped the most was that my husband was totally on board. He was also quite comfortable with her since he was working from home at the time."
Mommit,3dh03s,snuggleslut,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"I am a working mom and have to travel periodically.  I have a 2 year old and while I did not have to travel that early, it is still difficult to leave my little guy and I always feel guilty.    I think the trip is short enough that it won't really have any impact and it will most definitely be harder for you than for your son!  As for your husband, maybe you could leave during his days off for a couple hours (mani, pedi?!)  during your son's ""better"" times of the day so they can bond and you'll be close to home.  The worst thing you can do is try to force bonding and it does take time.  Have him bath your son, do diaper changes, read to him.  Once he has a little bit more confidence, he will be better suited to comfort and soothe a baby.  Good luck!"
Mommit,3dds7h,Momanatrix,22,Wed Jul 15 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Throw money at whatever you can: get a cleaning lady once a week, use a grocery delivery service (or just do it online and have them load up the car - free), find a nanny that will also start dinner and do light housekeeping. Remember to take 'you time' whenever and however you squeeze it in, even if it's just listening to your favorite music really loud or book on tape during your commute.  Take care of yourself in little ways like a delicious overpriced coffee once a week on your way in to work.  Good luck mama."
Mommit,3dds7h,Sweet_Titties,8,Wed Jul 15 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"get a cleaning lady once a week   This.  Ours comes every other week and I couldn't be happier.  Cleaning is such a chore especially when the little ones get in the way.  I'll take the kids to the park and run errands while the cleaning lady gives our house a nice deep clean every two weeks.  I can keep up with light housework, but ain't no way I'm tackling dust bunnies under the dressers, along baseboards or on the ceiling fan blades like she does.  I am most relaxed when I return to a clean home and so is my hubby.  Worth it."
Mommit,3dds7h,YaHurd_Wurd,2,Wed Jul 15 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"This is GREAT advise! Depending on where you live, you can order your groceries online and pick up in store, I use this when I'm late coming home from the dairy and we're out of everything lol see if there's a local daycare who does pick ups from the school your kids go to, the one I went to when I was growing up was awesome, she did homework with us, helped with projects and dropped us off/picked us up from school most days. It may be that you will need to hire a nanny to take over most duties.. This is common where I live. Both of our neighbors have nannies (one found through their church, the other an online service), who does errands, picks ups the kids, helps with housework and is there to make or start dinner if needed. They don't have to live with you, and you can usually find an agency who will help you find a suitable match for your family. It may not be too early to start a nanny service, even if its two or three days a week for now.. Just to get them and the kiddos acquainted and give them a chance to see your family's schedule and way of doing things... Also, don't forget about ""Mannie's"" (male nannies).. My cousins had one who was FANTASTIC, taught them to swim, took them hiking, did all sorts of things other nannies wouldn't... He's still a strong part of their family though he moved to Australia, my cousin just spent a month with him actually!! Good luck!! And sorry for highjacking this comment... I get started and can't stop haha need more adult contact I guess?"
Mommit,3dds7h,ErikaSaysChah,8,Wed Jul 15 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"My mom had 4 under 5  when I was little, and my dad worked at least ten hours a day...some days he got home after we were in bed.  Her tips to me were: enforce naptime and bedtime. She switched the locks on our doors so they locked from the outside, so that even if we didn't sleep she got 30 minutes of peace. Bedtime was at 8 pm, and even though she left the doors open it was a form rule that we did NOT leave our rooms.  She also hired a teenage girl from down the block as a mother's helper- she would come over and babysit us while my mom paid bills, did yardwork, cleaned,  or ran errands so she could do it kid free.  It's also never too early to assign your kids age appropriate chores. Your 7 year old can help set the table, empty the dishwasher, put laundry away, or maybe even take out the trash. Make a chore chart with each kid's chores listed and tell them that after school but before dinner they have to pick one chore off the chart, for example. Keeps them busy and makes a little less work for you, especially as they get older and you can give them bigger jobs like cleaning the bathroom!  Good luck! As an adult, I am grateful for my siblings every day, and I am in awe of how much work it must have been for my mom- my own 3 under 6 keep me busy enough, I can't imagine having one more in the mix!"
Mommit,3dds7h,statmama,5,Wed Jul 15 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I don't have that many kids but I am a single mom to two kids and have been since they were 3 and 1 (now 3 and 5). When you have small kids who aren't in school yet, whether you are doing it alone or not, identify what stresses you out and work to eliminate it. I have a cleaning lady that comes every two weeks. She does the deep cleaning and it's amazing! Also, I have a $40 a week set of groceries delivered every Monday. They bring the milk, eggs, bananas, yogurt, all the things you need weekly. The only shopping I do is Costco once or twice a month. These two combined has saved me my sanity and given me more quality time with my kids. Having to take them to the grocery store at the end of a long day or stressing about messes were two things that I decided was worth getting help with because of my sanity and I couldn't be happier that I did!"
Mommit,3dds7h,athwartthelotus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"That's great advice. Getting paidy help with household tasks,  daycare, help from extended family or online shopping/deliveries can make everything so much easier. Budget within your means for this stuff and outsource whatever you can.  At our place I get a cleaner every fortnight and I swear it saved my relationship with my partner: I don't think either of us could have survived another argument about who's turn it was to clean the toilet ;)"
Mommit,3dds7h,Libelia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more! I don't have tons of money (I'm a teacher) but as a single mom, just having that little bit of extra help really goes a long way for me. The extra few bucks a month is completely worth it when it lowers your stress level and gives you more quality time with your family!"
Mommit,3dds7h,athwartthelotus,2,Thu Jul 16 05:29:36 2015 UTC,"I have 4 kids, ages 4, 2, and twin 1 year olds. It can get a little hectic at times but we've learned to cope with it all. We both work so we've been extremely lucky finding a good daycare, and taking turns with the kids at night if one of us feels like we need a break. All I can say is get organized and have a plan for the week/month. We have a calendar and noteboard in the kitchen that we both look at so we both know what is going on. Although must of this falls on me, but it has helped keep my sanity."

My kids go to bed early and that means my husband and I have time together in the evening, either to chill or work on a project.   Just the other day one of my daughters took a shower. By herself.

Mommit,3dds7h,Pisaun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"I was there seven years ago.  We had a new born, a two year old, a four year old and a six year old.  It's rough when they're little.    I prepped their breakfast every morning so the six year old could serve the younger two and herself.  That way it gave me more time with the baby first thing in the morning.    Breakfast was sippy cups full of milk in the fridge, a sandwich bag of cheerios (or whatever cereal we had) and some kind of fruit in bag (apple slices, blueberries, whatever).    That helped me out quite a bit.  And they were all old enough for chores.  The two year old picked up his toys and put them away.  The four year old picked up trash.  And the six year old did both."
Mommit,3ddxhb,mummablebee,4,Wed Jul 15 14:50:35 2015 UTC,You may want to get him checked for an ear infection. Laying flat can cause a huge amount of pain. My son had chronic ear infections and had to sleep with his head elevated so he would sleep.
Mommit,3ddxhb,wildbluyawnder,2,Wed Jul 15 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of things (illness, teeth, new developmental jump, etc.) but it's very likely just a rough patch and will get better soon.  Keep offering him chances to sleep and stick to as regular a pattern/schedule as you can.  Are you doing anything for tooth pain?  My kiddos really loved to chew on frozen washcloths (wet the thin little baby washcloths and wad them up on a freezer shelf so they freeze in interesting shapes) and that helped a lot of teething symptoms.  There are a billion remedies out there, though, so see if something appeals."
Mommit,3ddxhb,Sketchbooks,2,Wed Jul 15 17:01:12 2015 UTC,His nap sheducle could be changing.  Try one right after lunch and see what happens ? Or try a later bedtime. It changes so much in the first couple of years its hard to keep with
Mommit,3ddh7u,delicatedelirium,26,Wed Jul 15 12:23:28 2015 UTC,"Amnesia means forgetting things, usually from some kind of head trauma, but emotional trauma may cause it.  Insomnia is not being able to sleep. I guess you mean insomnia since your post is all about sleeping troubles and not memory issues.   As someone else mentioned painkillers could be affecting her sleep. But I had a natural birth with no medication at all, and still had trouble sleeping for several days, maybe a week or more. I told my husband it was like I had to teach myself to sleep all over again. I was just so hyper aware of everything. Luckily for me I've always had a hard time getting to sleep, so I had years of tricks to get myself to relax and my brain to shut off, it was just harder than usual.  The one that works best for me is counting. But not just counting, you have to lay in a comfortable position and really concentrate on counting. Your mind should be empty of everything but a number, really try to visualize it. If you get distracted and start thinking of something else, start all over from 1."
Mommit,3ddh7u,BatFace,8,Wed Jul 15 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"I had the snap awake thing after my c section due to the morphine, I didn't sleep at all the first night because scary terror type things would kick in as soon as I fell asleep. To a lesser extent it also happened with the endone I took for my recovery and it stopped when I stopped taking the painkillers. Could it be that? Is her wound okay, no redness or leaking or signs of infection? Op recovery and newborn made me feel like I was losing my mind though, it was an awful time."
Mommit,3ddh7u,existingbike,7,Wed Jul 15 14:09:35 2015 UTC,I was extremely forgetful right after my baby. Mine was sleep deprivation and stress-induced. (Husband and i both lost our jobs right after she was born.)  I would get her into the doctor soon and maybe get her to talk about post partum depression. It's better to be proactive and cover all bases than let out get any worse.   Good luck and please keep us updated!
Mommit,3ddh7u,twoob,4,Wed Jul 15 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing, I had an emergency c section after being in the hospital for 2 days (and not sleeping while there) and for days after, anytime I was about to fall asleep I would get the 'snaps' and jerk myself awake. I also had an enormous amount of guilt about trying to sleep, my mother stayed with us the first few days and the baby would be asleep, my mother would be watching him, I would lay down and try to sleep (I was dead tired and so incredibly sleep deprived at this point) but this guilt would wash over me and I would be unable to fall asleep, convinced that if I did, something horrible would happen to him!   I know it's tough but it does sound pretty normal to me, hang in there and just try to get through the next few days. (one thing that helped me a little was having the baby right next to me when sleeping, if you're comfortable with it, perhaps you could try that)"
Mommit,3ddh7u,fireawayjohn,4,Wed Jul 15 15:58:47 2015 UTC,"I think you are talking about insomnia. I had this when I was in the hospital after having a c-section. I was in labor for 32 hours with no sleep, then I had the surgery and although I was extremely tired, I couldn't sleep. I would sleep and hour here or there. I felt guilty sleeping, and by reading the comments, it sounds like a common occurrence.   I know the medicines I was given played a part in having some anxiety as well. When I got home, my husband went on baby duty at night to help me sleep. I actually slept in a separate room then them. It may sound cruel, but it was the only way I could sleep. It only lasted a week at most until I could get my rhythm back. He would change her, then bring her to me to feed, then put her back to sleep.   Having a newborn, going through surgery/birth is a big deal and can do crazy things to your body. Let her know that she doesn't need to feel guilty, and to do what she needs to, to feel better so she can be healthy for the baby.   Good luck, I hope she is able to relax and get some rest!   Oh! Another thing that helped me sleep was taking naps with the baby. I know co-sleeping may not be encouraged, but it really helped me relax and bond with her. Maybe she can nap with baby in bed while you stay awake to watch over them if she is worried.  I don't know, I'm just throwing things out there. I know how she feels."
Mommit,3ddh7u,BettyVonBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:43 2015 UTC,I had the cough thing all through pregnancy and a few times postpartum. I think it has to do with the relaxin chemical in the body effecting the windpipe it something around there. Gets irritated while laying down.
Mommit,3ddh7u,tealeaf_monster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah i had the same thing. Im assuming you mean insomnia. I didnt sleep at all for about 3 days. My sons first week i slept maybe 10 hours total. A women definitely has a adrenaline in her system when a babys born or else she wouldnt be able to look after the baby after birth. Its incredibly draining and stressful. In the evenings i would shake, cry, and get bery anxious an panicked. I definitely had a few panic attacks in the first week due to exhaustion and ""baby blues"".  Although its very hard, it sounds to me that what shes going through is normal. Definitely talk to the nurse. She'll have tips and advice you when this is a problem. The first weeks are very, very tough. Even if she doesnt sleep, if she just lays down durring the day when the babys sleeping will help. Even just resting helps. Its a huge, huge adjustment. Itll take awhile for her body to adjust. I bet by next week shell be passing out as soon as her head hits the pillow!"
Mommit,3ddh7u,AK2K12,0,Wed Jul 15 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"If you mean insomnia and not amnesia, disregard my comment.  I had a friend who had insomnia, and anxiety postpardum that progressed into postpartum psychosis and amnesia. She actually forgot things about her baby, her so, her friends/family. She ended up being hospitalized but is fine now, 6 months later.   If that sounds like your wife, seeing a doctor is a good idea. PPD or PPP can be very serious left unchecked."

Mommit,3da7rx,Zeblistic,13,Tue Jul 14 22:37:42 2015 UTC,Wow! That's quite the difference! My kids came out with dark hair and turned blonde too but they didn't have much hair in the beginning so it doesn't look as drastic.

Mommit,3da7rx,spidersRcute,24,Tue Jul 14 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks, I think she's pretty cute (I am biased).    Her hair was slowly getting browner, but then all but a strip on top of her head fell out at 4.5 months and the new growth has been blonde! The strip is usually in a tiny bun now, and more falls out daily.  It is long and ombré though, pretty stylin'.  You can see it starting here at 6 months: http://imgur.com/h0ANmak"

By the way she is absolutely beautiful.

Mommit,3dcpe8,finchy7373,2,Wed Jul 15 06:15:45 2015 UTC,It gets easier as they get older and more independent.
Mommit,3dcpe8,paraakrama,2,Wed Jul 15 14:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still working on this.  My son is 3 and he is definitely less needy at this point.  I have some more free time now, so I'm starting to remember things that I used to do like painting, singing, reading books that are not about how to get your child to sleep or not behave like a barnyard animal, etc.  It's been getting better over time but I've found that I need to be intentional about it."
Mommit,3dcpe8,momodax,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: most of the time, your thoughts aren't going to be for yourself. It's part of being a mother. It's in the job description, so to speak.   Disengaging enough to spare some thoughts for yourself takes practice and time. Time, because it gets easier the older and less needy they get. Going back to work helped, as well as daycare even when I started to work from home. I also found it necessary to aggressively pursue an identity other than 'mother'. For me, it was art. For you, it might be running, or roller derby, or writing. Whatever it is, be that thing to the extent it makes you happy. A happy mom with something to talk about other than her kid is fun to be around, and having friends outside momhood (even if they are parents too and you, GASP, have something in common!) goes a long way to feeling yourself."
Mommit,3dcpe8,turkproof,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:32:36 2015 UTC,"As a stay at home mom, I have my things that help me keep sane. If I don't go do my volunteer work every week, I get batty. I also go out of my way to make sure I still practice piano-it might not be as often as I'd like, but I have to do some things for myself to keep myself sane. Otherwise, how am I going to take care of my family?  Yes, with age of the kid it helps, but you have to take care of you to take care of your family. If you don't, you can go down a very bad path. Pick something that you used to enjoy ( or still do) and do it. Even if its for five minutes, just do it. Know I'm sending love, and best wishes. :)"
Mommit,3dcpe8,StarDancin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:40:24 2015 UTC,I used to run! I like the idea of at least 5 mins. Thank you. I will start small with at least 10 mins of running a day

I'm kidding...kind of. Anyway, I do get time for myself and here's my secret: when I was pregnant with our daughter, I told my husband that any time he got in a week, I did too. I sure as hell was not going to be stuck at home with the baby while he went out gaming as often as he did before we became parents.  Keep at least one hobby. I knit, and it's a great social activity especially for introverts like me. I go out twice a week and my husband takes care of the kids. Then two other times per week, I care for the kids and my husband plays games."

Mommit,3dcpe8,coedel1121,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:03 2015 UTC,"Exercise and my commutes are my ""alone"" time.  Although I admit I think about my family during those times, I let myself stop and look out the window (I take a train) or walk at the end of a run and just take in the scenery, where if I was with my 2 year old, I wouldn't be able to stop and appreciate it, I would be running after him.  Taking time to yourself is important.  It is likely you will never be ""who you were"" but having a few moments to yourself will help ground you and discovery the ""new"" you.  I admit I felt the same way probably for the first year of my son's life, but having an infant takes a lot out of you and you are adjusting to a new life.  I am guilty of putting everyone else before myself so I make sure that I take the time I need to relax and decompress, even if its just a few minutes a day."

I'm worried she's going to chop it into little pieces with her hamster teeth and and choke on them. I already had to do the Heimlich once with a tiny piece of apple, now I'm crazy paranoid. How do you deal?"
Mommit,3d6ir9,littlebugs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:25:49 2015 UTC,"Have you read the BLW book? It does a great job of walking you through things. For our kids, if they were making sounds they were probably gagging, not choking. Recognizing the difference is huge. Choking is silent. The book illustrates it a lot better than I can do. We checked ours out from the library before beginning blw.  Meanwhile, our baby just turned eight months. She eats corn, green beans, broccoli, chicken or beef strips, carrots, cold rice (it's clumpy and easier to pick up), bread crusts, Cheerios, half raisins, almost anything but soup, really. Our older son got so many compliments on how much variety he would eat and on his fine motor skills.  Oh, and get a dog or borrow one. It's super messy."
Mommit,3d6ir9,piratespit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"She definitely wasn't making any noise. Just bug-eyed, red faced, no breathing. It was terrifying! The Heimlich did the job though. She spat out that tiny chunk of apple and started coughing and was totally fine. She didn't even cry. I cried. She's only 6.5 months right now, so I'm going to take it slow. She's doing pretty good with bread though. I'll check out the book and see what we can do! Thanks for your advice."

I did BLW with my daughter, and I get so many compliments on what a good eater she is :) We never had issues with choking, just tons of gagging, which is 110% normal. I just cut everything we ate into strips and served her what we were eating. I didn't worry about spices because we don't really use salt anyway. She LOVES spicy foods now."
Mommit,3d6ir9,Dustjackan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! What do you do about gagging? Just pull whatever it is out of her mouth, or do you let her work it out?"
Mommit,3d6ir9,snikkih5,0,Tue Jul 14 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"I always just let her work it out. Sticking your fingers in could potentially push it down her throat, turning the gagging into actual choking, which is obviously no good! Gagging is just part of the learning process, and I figured the more she gagged, the faster the reflex would go away. I would say that we started BLW around 6.5 months, and it was somewhere between 8-9 before she actually swallowed anything. It was 12 to 14 months before a full meal was consumed. Her timeline was all very normal, considering the whole ""food before one is just for fun"". I took the opportunity to introduce the individual allergen foods between 6 and 9 months too."
