The city is quite defensible, but I'm not quite sure how to win Domination as Venice as we'll need bullshit amounts of gold to get enough units to match the death carpets that these civs like to build.

The best tip is to exploit that you can purchase units in puppeted cities. So for an example, you can get a MoV and buy a new citystate on a new continent. Buy a barracks and then either sail your army to the new city, or just buy your army there. Then you are ready for war.   The only problems i struggled with was happines.

civ,3e31cl,rubixor,8,Tue Jul 21 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"If you want this army to be used for the rest of the game, then promotions are your number one priority. You can dominate with well promoted units even if you are behind in military techs (even more if you are even or ahead). Also, if you have the Ikanda, the Impis can get promotions that increase ranged defense making them very difficult to kill. Also, they upgrade into rifleman meaning they will be top-notch infantry style units in the late game. I would definitely choose impis."
civ,3e31cl,rubixor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Will they be able take down cities by themselves, or should I build some crossbows to help them, and trebuchets to deal with larger cities?"
civ,3e31cl,Murnig,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"Due to the spear throw ability (which means they automatically perform a ranged attack before their melee attack), they can for the most part take cities by themselves. But once you start upgrading them into riflemen, it might not hurt to get a few cannons/artillery to go with them."
civ,3e31cl,devonladykiller,4,Tue Jul 21 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think they do their spear throw against cities, just other units."

You should probably bring some trebuchets with to take cities since slamming your Impi's into the city won't do enough damage to take it down without getting them severely damaged and then killed."
civ,3e31cl,Lunaticen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"Same damage as their base, that's why the upgrade into Rifleman and not Musketmen, otherwise the upgrade would leave them weaker."

civ,3e1dm3,xCharg,8,Tue Jul 21 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"To everyone who doesn't know:  When a city gets enough culture, it expands it borders. It will expand up to 5 tiles away from the city itself, or more if you have mods. The borders will expand to ANY available tile within the 5-tile radius (or 7-tile, or whatever the modded limit is), even if other Civs/City-States own tiles between your city and the new tile. In this case, Poland was cut off by the city-state, but the coast tile near OP's work boat was within the tile-growth limit. So, naturally, Poland's borders grew out and simply took the tile.  This just another reason to crush Poland as soon as you find him."
civ,3e1dm3,ApertureBrowserCore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that the city should be growing into the free forest below that sea tile instead, but seeing how he is using CBP (producing culture) cultural diffusion is out since is not compatible."

civ,3e2zcg,bigfootplays,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say settle on the hill next to the horses, since the other spots lack production. If you worry about getting the spices (which I don't think you have to), settle on the horses.  A possible alternative could be 7-7-7 from your archer, since that also doesn't lack production and could profit well from stables. At that spot you'd lack horses, however."
civ,3e2zcg,Blackheart595,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"Even though the production is low, the coastal tile next to the mountain and the bananas would make an awesome science / second city."
civ,3e2zcg,Vlad_Yemerashev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"I'd settle on the hill right next to the spices. It's one a river, has a new lux, and plenty of food. And horses. The only downside is lack of production...  Alternatively you could settle one tile to the east of that so that you can put a mine on that hill, but that loses the river. One tile north keeps the river and the hill, but it's a tad too close to Athens for my taste. However, I'm a VERY tall player so I prefer far-apart spaced cities. It shouldn't be that much of a problem if they have a bit of overlap. The spot has the river and the hill so I'd say it's worth it. Also with that tile one north of the hill, you reach a hill 3 tiles away to the west, but with the other tiles it's unreachable. I'd say one north from the hill next to the spices.  Now for a third city, I'd go with the hill south-east of the mountain. It's on a coast, near a mountain (observatory!), has fish, bananas, and spices (trade away for lux/gold), and decent-ish production. On the other hand if you settle one tile to the east of that you lose the mountain (for observatory - there are still wonders you can build since you're within two tiles of a mountain) but gain another mined hill for production. That ones up to you - mountain for observatory or hill for production."
civ,3e2zcg,jkudria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'd go down south. Get a spot that's adjacent to both mountain and coast.  Won't be the best city starting out, especially for production since that area is mostly jungle, but 2 bananas and 1 fish (and hey, there might be more in the FoW) will help it get up to speed quickly enough.   Depending on the map type you may want to begin your oceanic exploring sooner rather than later, and a coastal second city can help with that. Later on you can gear it towards science. The mountain plus all that jungle should make it a pretty good science producer."
civ,3e2zcg,Gluttony4,0,Tue Jul 21 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Not enough information. You never built a 2nd Scout, so you only have access to about half the information you'd need to be able to answer where to settle next."

Looooong games with lots of fighting in each era.)  Use any of the various mods that improve the AI (Artificial Unintelligence, Human Strategy, etc)  But finally, the most important mod: AMERICAN DOMINATION  Play as America (fuck yeah!), and proceed to spread truth, justice, and the American way to all corners of the Earth!  Note: definitely play this on a higher difficulty than normal. If you start in the Ancient era, you get the first 4 techs free (Pottery, etc).

Its rare for all the AI to pick the same ideology from what I have seen, and when they switch, it usually follows a big war or embargo or something.

civ,3dxwlb,lilmeatwad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:49 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. I won my last game on Immortal going Piety -> Aesthetics and just a few techs in Rationalism before Ideologies came into play. All the faith turned out to be massively useful for the culture game.

civ,3dxwlb,lilmeatwad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:18 2015 UTC,"No, I was playing as Ethiopia. I got a very strong religion early on. Pagodas helped make up my culture deficiency to get through the piety tree. After that my massive faith generation helped me buy the great people I needed to rush wonders, fill writing/music/artist slots, and give science boosts.  I filled out the Aesthetics tree next to boost my culture and tourism scores. I only took a few policies in Rationalism, and then only after I filled out Aesthetics. I used Oxford to get Radio and adopted Freedom. After that it was just a matter of choosing the right techs to boost my tourism and filling out slots. I paid the AIs to war each other and had trade routes and open borders with everyone.  I was never the tech leader, but I was never far behind, and I focused on the techs to get what I needed while using diplomacy to keep anyone from declaring war. It was a fun game, in a different way from my usually domination/science victory games. The thrill came from getting much needed wonders, timing great people, and accumulating more social policies than I knew what to do with. I hurt a little in terms of growth and production in the early game, but it was hardly crippling and the faith and reformation belief more than made up for it."

Plant until you have your public schools up, then bulb. GE plant if you don't want a (contested) wonder in near future.   Else plant. GP. I usally only use them to convert/religion. Planting them is usally not worth it. BUT you can steal GP from other religions and plant them... I never bulb GW. I never feel it's worth it. GA: Pretty nice to bulb if you play Persia. Else I'd use them for the great work. You don't have that many slots anyway so there will be enough to bulb. GM: early ones are weak. Only go for concerts with later ones. Admiral/General are completely situational."

Save them for eight turns after winning the rights to host the World's Fair and you can usually get 1.5x the culture needed for a new policy.  So 2 GW will usually net me 3 new policies in Industrial/Modern era.  Totally worth bulbing."
civ,3e2mam,Xaphe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"""After wining world's fair"" is pretty situational.  Also here an other thought: A great work will always give you additional tourism. So bulbing them gives you a less diverse yield.  Sadly there are only few social policies that powerful that you need them asap. Also social policies aren't contested. And there is no tremendous advantage you get over others if you are a bit earlier.   (Other than GE and GS, in some cases bulbing them will give a powerful advantage in tech or get you a wonder you wouldn't get else).  But in the end it is best to maximize the yield one will get out of the Great writer since there is no ""situational"". Just the question if there are enough turns left [or maybe world's fair for double the bulb amount]"
civ,3e2mam,H5oD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with these, though I will sometimes plant GPs instead of founding a religion if I'm pretty sure I'm going to be overrun by an AI religion anyway.

There's obviously a scale, as with everything, but I'm not really comfortable with slurs taking hold like this.   It's often errounously credited to Descartes to have said:   Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.   Do you think actual racists are embarrassed to use the word because Polandball uses it? Some will also see the satire as legitimate and, in the end, maybe even most.

Open Honor, so you know where the encampments spawn and have a bonus against barbarians - depending on what difficulty you play, you may already have a 40% bonus against them, and the Honor bonus will stack with that, giving you a total of 73% damage against barbarians.   Send out your warrior and an archer to every single encampment that spawns, taking out every single barbarian unit along the way, beefing up these two units and making them even stronger. Wipe up every single encampment within your army's reach - keep every single military unit on the move, as the more barbarians and encampments you encounter in the early game, the larger, stronger, and more terrifying your army will be.  Be sure to leave a few units surrounding your cities, too, in order to take out barbarians that stroll up, and to hunt down more encampments that may spawn around your territory. With Germany's bonuses, and ability to recruit units from encampments, there's no excuse for letting barbarians tear up your land, even if they are ""raging."""

civ,3dxma3,Indon_Dasani,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"That's not the AI - that's the one-unit-a-tile system.  It's too computationally difficult to get an AI to work with it. Consider that when you move a lot of military units a long distance in Civ V, you have to be careful about moving a lot of them through the same spaces in close quarters, because the automatic-moving-thing doesn't keep track of who should move first to clear the way for others. That's what the AI is doing every single turn, because it would simply take too long to have to figure out which unit out of all their units should move first, and which second, and so on.  There are mods for Civ V that provide improvements but they can't ever equal a skilled human player."
civ,3dxma3,Patrik333,3,Mon Jul 20 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"Why would it take too long, though? There are simple chess games with AI that feel difficult to play against, without the AI needing to pre-plan the whole game... the military part of Civ just seems like a sort of variant of Chess (although, played on hexes and with more rules). I don't see how it would take an AI longer to plan ahead in a Civ battle than planning a similar number of moves ahead in a game of chess...  E: Actually I guess it's a bit different because you get to move all your pieces every turn in Civ... but even so... I don't see how it can be that hard to make an AI that can make most of the same decisions that a human player can do in a short amount of time - there's sometimes a bit of creativity needed, but often you can rely on applying a simple tactic pretty methodically... I dunno, I've not tried much programming so I don't know how hard it might be...  Maybe just have it so that it does consider the actions of all its units each turn, does a simple risk calculation based on how much damage their unit will do, and receive, and how exposed to other units it'll put them... and does this for all melee units first, then fast units, then ranged, and then other units... and then goes round a second time just in case some units were better off fortified but now could be worthwhile using... I dunno."
civ,3dxma3,Indon_Dasani,9,Mon Jul 20 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"There are simple chess games with AI that feel difficult to play against, without the AI needing to pre-plan the whole game...   The rules of chess are simpler; you only move one piece per turn. (There are also fewer pieces and a smaller board)  In computer science, there's something called complexity analysis. At a really high level, that's basically taking all the possible options, you multiply them together, and that's the general ballpark of how many things your program will have to look at to figure out what the best option is.  So say you want to make a brute-force algorithm in Chess without the benefit of any of the game-specific optimizations that people have come up with over decades (because that's not an option for our Civ programmers, Civ V is too new). Each move the computer takes has a given number of options: Every free space that any piece can go into. Most pieces don't have that many options - pawns can have at most 3 at any time (en passant opportunity while at home row, for move 1, normal capture, and en passant) for instance and there are 8 pawns so that's only 24 opportunities. Other pieces have more, but not too much more - 1,000 move opportunities is probably more than you'll ever see in a practical game, and it seems managable, right?  So then you want the computer to not just play, but play smartly - it needs to be able to evaluate the tactical value of each of those thousand moves.  And if you want it to play as well as an average human player, it needs to look forward multiple moves - each of which provides a thousand options. So a program that looks N moves into the future needs to do 1,000N things (for scale, computers do billions of things a second - without optimization, that's 3 turns ahead, less than the average 4 turns a human looks). Chess programmers get around this very rapidly scaling problem by just assuming human opponents won't make a lot of different possible moves so they don't plan for everything - Kasparov actually exploited this to beat Deep Blue in one of his games.  But anyway, we have a baseline, let's look at Civ 5. Firstly, there are more units. Then each unit has way more move options - not just where to move, but how to move there, by using roads, pathing around mountains or forests, etc.  And this increases rapidly with the unit's move - a Warrior (2 move) has 18 move options (6+12) - a Modern Tank (6 move iirc) on a flat plain can move to 126 hexes (6+12+18+24+30+36). If your army has ten tanks it's probably as complex as a full chess army with freedom of movement by itself, before bringing in any complications like roads or, heaven forfend, being the Incas.  Then, each move takes much longer to consider. Chess positions can be evaluated pretty simply; how well defended are they? Count the number of allied pieces that can attack the square. How dangerous is it? Count the number of enemy pieces that can attack the square. How tactically advantageous? Count the number of enemy pieces you could attack once you move there. Pick the highest number when you're done. There's no archer kiting in chess. There are no ranged attacks or healing or defense bonuses in chess. So every single move can take much longer to evaluate.  Now - after our system is already magnitudes harder to calculate than chess - we come to the part humans never notice and computers can't do: Picking which unit should move first. A human looks at their objective, says, ""Okay I want to move this, this, then this,"" and just does it. But if you want to get a brute force computer program to figure out the best option it needs to evaluate all its choices, for every one of the pieces. Then when it picks the best one, it moves one piece, and has to recalculate every move that might potentially be different because now nearby pieces can move to some places they couldn't before and can't move to some places they could. This is basically like trying to look ahead multiple moves, only you haven't even taken one move yet.  Then you want to look ahead multiple moves, probably at least 3 since it can easily take 3 moves just to kill a couple units and change the tactical situation. Taking a city usually takes way more than 3 moves though.  All this combined will mean your AI will take forever to calculate anything. Mind you, this is a game that chugs on calculating city domestic output on large maps, which is basically just adding things. It is not well-programmed.  The Civ programmers get around this by cutting all the corners. Thus, stupid AI. It could be improved some, but it could never be made as smart as a human, who can look many moves ahead, evaluate many different objectives simultaneously, and know how to competently promote units."
civ,3dxma3,fritzvonamerika,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, I read through it... I get that if you want to have a perfect AI then it would need to make thousands of decisions - it could potentially decide the outcome of an entire battle before the first move... but what about just half way - how does a human player play any more smartly than a computer could play?  As in, all the decisions you say the computer would need to make, the human would also need to make... And if Civ is 'too new' for more general strategies to emerge, then how can human players know which moves will work better or not?  I know that when I play Civ, I only anticipate one turn ahead or so at most, and often I use the auto-pathfinding myself - which does get my units across the terrain most quickly... Actually to be honest, there are only a few times where the AI has acted dumbly...  But yeah, I know chess is a different game - another reason Civ is more complex is that the terrain is always randomized, and each sides' ""pieces"" vary with each battle... but whatever a human player has to evaluate... surely that's no less than what an AI has to?"
civ,3dxma3,Patrik333,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I read through it... I get that if you want to have a perfect AI then it would need to make thousands of decisions - it could potentially decide the outcome of an entire battle before the first move... but what about just half way - how does a human player play any more smartly than a computer could play?   You balance your strategic objectives and execute them all at once.  So say you have a bunch of units and you want to besiege a city you're at war with 10 turns away. You could just select each of your units and tell them all to move right up next to the city. Have you ever tried to move a lot of units in one place to another place, say 10 turns away?  You'll notice that the autopathing often dumbly causes your units to bonk against each other until they work themselves out into an impromptu line - especially if any point of the route has a bottleneck. And that's how the CPU invades you. They have an objective and they directly pursue that objective and they save a lot of time not having to consider and evaluate other options and possibilities.  But when you do it, you think, ""Oh man. I'm at war with this guy, I should keep my units together so I'm not slowly picked off as my huge strung-out army walks into the guy's territory"" so you move your army manually and you don't die like the AI does.  Could the AI do that? Yes. It'd just make computer turns take way longer."
civ,3dxma3,joaofcv,4,Mon Jul 20 20:22:23 2015 UTC,"That got me thinking, would it work well to build a road into your empire and therefore funnel the enemy into chokepoints of your choosing like several citadels by exploiting that pathfinding tendency?

civ,3dxma3,Xujhan,3,Mon Jul 20 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand how hard it is to make AIs ""understand"" anything, even something as simple as ""I'll move in this direction to avoid the mountains and then turn right"". There are things that a human player can easily identify, but for an AI require checking a lot of things: all the movement of all its units and the possible movement of enemy units and the terrain and the time it will take to get there and what is the best destination and what unit it should move first and the type of unit. Then it has to redo all that every turn, for every movement. In addition to everything else it has to do and choose. And if it wants to ""predict"" a best course, it would need to simulate every relevant possibility (and Civ is about having lots of those). It would take far too long or require far too much computer power, not to consider the complexity of programming something like that. It would require the developers to actually figure out a step-by-step strategy for every possible Civ game ever - everything you need to check and what you should decide in every case.  Chess has many possibilities, but still far less than a game like Civ. A much smaller map, fewer pieces, limited movements for each. And yet, players will take a really long time deciding their next movement based on all possibilities. Computers learn at least in part by ""studying"" old games and learning complex patterns of play - while there are many possibilities, some of them are so unlikely or pointless that they don't really happen.  I don't really know that much about AIs and game programming, but from the little I know it looks like an overwhelming task. While improvements can be done (especially as computers grow more powerful), it is no surprise that game AIs hit a few walls."
civ,3dxma3,joaofcv,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"""I'll move in this direction to avoid the mountains and then turn right"".   Huh? That bit seems trivial if pathfinding AI in games like GTA V can tell me the fastest way to get all the way from one side of the map to the other, and then things like SatNavs can even reroute me based on the traffic, the speed of the road etc. in a split second...   Then it has to redo all that every turn, for every movement. In addition to everything else it has to do and choose.   But that's something a human player also has to do, surely?   And if it wants to ""predict"" a best course, it would need to simulate every relevant possibility (and Civ is about having lots of those).   Again, that's something a human player would have to do (if we wanted to play the 100% best moves we could... but obviously we'd take even longer if we tried considering every possibility, so why not just make the AI consider only the next 1 turn, of units that could possibly attack their own unit (as opposed to considering the following thousand turns of every single unit on the battlefield...))  I dunno much either so we're both arguing a topic that neither of us really know much about? But... I dunno, I think I'm just saying that there's a middle ground between an AI that makes really dumb moves regularly, and one that achieves that determinism thing and can predict every single possible outcome in a game from the first turn...  Thanks for the reply, though - I might be talking bullshit for all I know, but even so I like the discussion."
civ,3dxma3,DarkLava,2,Mon Jul 20 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"But that's something a human player also has to do, surely?   Humans are much better than modern computers at heuristic analysis. Computers are better at accurate calculation, but that doesn't help in games with many moves and a large number of options per move. Go is a classic example; even the best Go programs are only as good as an amateur human. Humans are excellent at using vague patterns to instantly discard all but the few most promising lines of action, which we then consider in more detail. Getting an AI to mimic that pattern of intuition is extremely hard because it's very hard to define rigorously what it means for a possible move to ""look good""."
civ,3dxma3,hybridthm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I have studied (briefly) algorithms for robot pathfinding and the basics of ""artificial intelligence"" (machine learning, pattern recognition), and I work with numerical calculus (i.e., using computers to do calculations that might take several days to complete). I'm not completely clueless, I'm just not familiar with the particular optimizations and solutions used for games - they probably use many heuristics that work much better than ""check every possibility"".  And I will say that even for a single robot, finding a route is often very hard and takes some computer power. For simple things like ""avoid a single obstacle"", it is simple enough, but when you have dead ends or branches or multiple obstacles it starts getting harder. You not only want it to get there, you want it to take a direct route (no going the wrong way and turning back). And in Civ you have to do that for all units, and redo every time a unit move as it changes the possible paths. To avoid doing unnecessary work, it will have to figure out which ares don't matter at all (and that is not obvious). The system still mostly works, the computer can get its units to where it wants, it doesn't send them bumping into mountains or seas before finding the right way. But there are some edge cases that look deceptively simple, but require considering a lot more factors a lot of time in advance.  Obviously, humans have to do most of that, but we automatically learn to recognize certain patterns. We filter what information is important and what isn't, we learn complex sets of movements and do a lot of things. Now try to break every decision you take in a game of Civ in terms of fundamental computer instructions, because to make the game do that you have to teach it from scratch. Building an AI that can do everything a human can is too much to ask."
civ,3dxma3,Cmndr_Duke,0,Tue Jul 21 15:58:28 2015 UTC,Well making AI noticeably smarter is harder to do the higher the difficulty gets. In plenty of games across all genres the AI gets benefits from increased difficulty. More damage output. More health.  Etc.
civ,3dxma3,glassesofanschlusses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should be so hard. Maybe they could do something like having the AI figure out the eight best moves and rank them from best to worst. Then have the AI pick the best move for deity, randomly pick one of the best two for immortal etc."

civ,3e1kxj,TeOr2419,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:31 2015 UTC,6 faith and 2 happiness are not big deal. And I'm assuming that in other terms this placement is much better than next to Mt. Kailash.

These valid points aside, I just wanted to point out that Mt. Kailish typically isn't worth it your capital. It makes for a great first expand (especially if you can buy a Granary right away too).  Uluru and Sri Pada on the other hand at least pay for the citizen working it."
civ,3e1kxj,Xaphe,2,Tue Jul 21 09:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is definitely not worth working immediately unlike the other faith mountains that actually give you 2 food, as it'll slow the rate at which your city grows. In this specific situation though, it would've been worth 2 turns to move and settle on top of the hill where the warrior is, had I gotten this information before haphazardly pressing ""Found City"", for the following reasons:    Extra initial hammer.  The ability to work the Natural Wonder for 6 Faith per turn and 2 Happiness later on. The ability to work the Antiquity Site from that ancient ruin (it is out of range).  You lose early access to 1 Whale, but gain far more late-game workable tiles compared to the initial site. which is not only near a large number of bland water tiles but also a mountain range."

No, it doesn't make sense to keep the unit around, the maintenance costs you pay will outweigh the other options, even if garrisoned.   I try to keep the smallest most modern military I can.

Obviously it is completely useless to annex when it's in resistance, and if it's a low pop city with no buildings that is literally in the middle of nowhere (since the AI often settles in those locations), you can usually leave it as a puppet for a while since AI will still grow the city and build basic crap like monuments.

It looks ugly when it mismatches your borders or your borders are gelatinous mess back and forth across the map, it goes in a stupid circle all around you, even along the coast, and on top of that, it's effects in game hardly make sense and is just really really annoying to play against. Don't get me started on how the enemy having dynamite has no effect on making it obsolete. Sorry, I hate this wonder. 0/10 Will not build."

civ,3dxxt8,Lamedonyx,9,Mon Jul 20 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well the whole point of the Wall wasn't really to keep anyone out, it was to slow them down long enough for the massive ultra-powerful fighting force that was Imperial China's army to get there in time and position themselves to intercept the enemy. It worked too, getting past the Wall was too much of a hassle for everyone not planning on outright conquest, and most wars at the time were fought to raid for supplies.  The dynamite thing though, yeah that's a little on the stupid side. I liked it better in Civ IV, when defensive structures just didn't protect against gunpowder units."
civ,3dxxt8,LMeire,5,Mon Jul 20 20:35:43 2015 UTC,when defensive structures just didn't protect against gunpowder units.   Because trenches didn't work at all in real life.
civ,3dxxt8,LibertarianSocialism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"Defensive structures were more ""stone walls and castles"" than anything resembling a trench. In fact, I'd say that if trenches are represented in-game, then it's with unit fortifying. Since ""fortifying"" something means to physically change it to something more defensible and the fortification bonus is lost if you move the unit- implying that the bonus is something you did to the terrain."

civ,3dxxt8,LMeire,2,Tue Jul 21 07:09:35 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't make sense for it to slow an army down once they've gotten past it. It doesn't have to be impossible to cross, just an ordeal when you get to it. It still doesn't make sense in either context."
civ,3dxxt8,Speicherleck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any penalty like that that wouldn't end up making the Great Wall pointless to build. A single-turn delay as you move over it wouldn't be any more inconveniencing than embarking over water to invade; it'd actually be less dangerous, since embarked units at least have a vulnerable point before they make landfall again. Not much of a defense in a game like Civ, certainly not worth wasting the hammers on compared to an equivalent number of spearmen/archers."
civ,3dxxt8,isaackleiner,20,Tue Jul 21 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"Wait, it redraws the wall? Crap, now I have to do the same each time I build the wall because I hate that. Damn you random stranger! It was good when I didn't knew that."

If your opponent makes spearmen to defend, laugh as you snipe the spearmen with your compbow elephants, your effective range is 4 tiles, move 2 shoot 2."

I get a great general quickly, plop a citadel overtop of my most active fort. They use up their entire army trying to break through and I don't lose a single unit.

One of my friends decided to invade so I started saying how my gigantic army would mean he would never take a city. He then retreated (without ever seeing a single unit) to build up for a huge all out assault. I (knowing that he would leave zero units behind) then took my entire army around the globe to the boarder of his empire. He then declared war on me, I didnt let him see my army until 5 of my 6 cities were taken as at this point he would be so far away it would take him about 20 turns to get back to his empire.

It was made up mostly of hills and was south of my border.   From very early game, I was already aware of Alexander's superior military might. Knowing his tendency to wage early wars in the past as well as seeing his troops lining up around this land bridge, I immediately built up a fort in the middle of the bridge and have my units hold that key location. Not long after I finished my fortification that Greece declared war on me (the bastard). Even though Alexander's troops outnumbered me 2 to 1, his numerical advantage was rendered useless by the fact that all of his land units had to line-up into one single file to get to me. Because I already predicted and prepared for this invasion, I was able to not only pushed his forces back but also destroyed most of his army as they mindlessly charged to their death.   After his futile offensive charge, Alexander offered peace like the little bitch that he was which I immediately declined. I was gonna get my payback no matter what ;). After I have gotten my Longbow men (I was playing England), I made the gradual push towards Sparta further down south and to Athens. Then all that left was his 3 coastal cities and Greece was no more. Of course, he pleaded for peace several more times but I was having none of it.

civ,3dw1j6,elbay,5,Mon Jul 20 07:47:05 2015 UTC,"I was playing a game as the Inca on a highlands map so lots of hills which really helped out with my defence.   To the North, a decent sized plain with Rome just beyond a two-tile-wide mountain choke point. To the East a mountain range with a choke point to defend against the inevitable war with the Huns in a valley surrounded by mountains. To the South, a dense jungle and mountain range and beyond that India who never had a problem with me. Finally, a sea to the West.  Rome attacked first with their legions and ballistas but my well placed cities and heavily ranged military kept them at bay and they sued for peace after a I was able to push them off my lands and even enter their territory.   The peace allowed me to build up siege units, pikemen and build forts at the choke points to defend against further Roman invasions and the Hunnic Hordes who both dwarfed my military.  As I was constructing the forts, the Huns attacked. They bypassed my other cities and went for the jugular, my capital, in as close to a pincer movement as possible in Civ. But because they ignored my other cities, I was able to rush and finish building the pikemen who joined the ranged vets of the Roman campaign. Once the Huns were scared off, I attempted to enter their lands but the same choke point I would use in the future in my defence would also help them in their defence. I sued for peace needing to restore my pillaged lands and build my military and economy up.  Rome once again declared war but I was ready for them. I lined up my troops close to their borders and proceeded to grind out my armies, building up experience and making sure as few units died as possible. The Huns followed suit and declared war. This time, I held them off at their choke point, and I grind out my troops there.   I have a DOF with Korea, who is east of the Huns and I ask them to attack the Huns, which they do. The Huns pull out and turn their armies towards Korea. I make peace with Rome a few turns later and invade the Huns with the vast majority of my military (you can't forget about defending the homefront from a possible Southern invasion), taking 4 or 5 of their cities.

To accomplish this, I downloaded mods for the WWII leaders of each major nation, and placed them in a map of earth mod with accurate starts and a bunch of vanilla civs I felt would be good for the game. I start off in NA alone since I forgot about downloading the Canada and Mexico mods with Brazil alone to the south. He and I do our thing with great peace and friendship for many thousands of years. I'm going for a science victory so I'm flying through the tech tree. Eventually, I'm able to cross the oceans so I send out as many ships as I can to explore. When I finally come across Europe, I find a land embroiled in political strife and conflict; nearly every nation hates one another, Sweden conquered most of Denmark, Poland and the UK have conquered Hitler's Berlin and Munich respectively, taking Hitler off the map. I see a land of rich natural resources, great wealth, as well as... opportunity... I snake my way into each and every nation's government and those that don't accept me become my first target. I begin to pay nation's to war with each other, my first enemy being Churchill's UK. I go to war with him under the guise of defending France and the other small nation's but my ultimate plan is to unleash Hitler's and Harold's revenge on Europe. By time I force Churchill into vassal capitulation and liberate Munich, Sweden had taken Berlin from Poland. I pay to rebuild Hitler and go to war with Poland and Sweden. I need Hitler at full power to take all of Europe so I go to war with Sweden to liberate Berlin and what had been taken from Denmark (Harold still had a couple cities when I arrived but they weren't enough to be powerful). Again, I force him to capitulate and become my vassal state and liberate all cities under Swedish control except I keep Stockholm as my foothold into Europe. Some turns earlier, Arabia had asked me to go to war with Egypt and global domination had become a thought in my mind so I agreed but I sent no troops south. After what I refer to the Aryan Wars, I heal my troops and start to send them south. On my way there, Poland took back Berlin so I send my troops back north to prematurely begin the Slavic Wars to conquer Poland and Stalin's USSR. Keep in mind I'm still paying every nation I can to go to war with each other so they'll be easier to conquer when I come and somehow I've still managed to disguise all of this warmongering as justified since only those with whom I'm at war dislike me. This brings me to now. I've conquered one of Poland's cities and have moved my troops in preparation of the Warsaw Invasion. This is when Poland decides to end the war with diplomacy and it's a great deal! The usual terms, we both end our conflicts with our allied CSs, he offers a few cities, and he offers Vassalage. I take off his cities since I don't want to take every nation, I simply want to make them all my slaves, and I throw in embassies and some GPT so he can rebuild. But, my game crashes when I hit accept every single time... And thus has ended my conquering of the world in the most disappointing way ever.

civ,3dw1j6,GPuzzle1,5,Mon Jul 20 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"I was playing multiplayer with two of my friends, and we're all pretty experienced with duplicity at this point. Near the start I scout around and discover that Friend A is very close to my border, and Friend B is further away, through a thin mountain range.  I began to notice B was slipping ahead in science (which was natural, as he was playing as Korea) so I began urging A to join me in an expedition to curtail B's growing strength. After some consternation, he agrees and we set off, both vowing to leave behind only a token defense in our nation's (a term I followed through with mind you).  About 5 turns into the march, I began to grow suspicious of Friend A's motives, as he insisted that all my troops form the front lines, supposedly out of altruism so I would receive the cities in the conquest, and my scout noted that B had massed a sizable force on the border we intended to attack.  It then occurred to me that I had likely been duped. A must have alerted B as to my plan, and they intended to sandwich and wipe out my army in the thin territory between B's nation and the exit of the mountain range. Luckily, I still had a few tricks up my sleeve.  I contained sending several of my troops out front, but allowed some spearmen to fall back behind the main force. At the same time, I began churning out pikemen, with the public justification that they were reinforcements for the marching army, which technically was not a lie.   Then, as our main armies reached their destination, I routed my army back into the mountain pass, the only route into and out of the basin where our troops were now massed, and fortified them on the hilly ground. At the same time, my newly created force rushed into A's undefended nation, quickly taking a border city while his main force, with B's help, tried to break the defensive wall that was blocking him from defending his empire. After his second (of three) cities fell, and he had effectively broken through the trap I had set, I offered peace, satisfied with the destruction I had wrought and that I had gotten one over on those who had tried to betray me."
civ,3dw1j6,kamicozzy,4,Mon Jul 20 05:18:15 2015 UTC,"Story time! So this game was a few years ago now, but it is still my all time favorite. I was playing Persia with continents+ I find Arabia, China...and The Monguls are my neighbors. Great. Genghis is going to be down my throat before long, so I'm going to have to divert a good bit of my production to defense.   This opens the door for China to Forward settle on me and Arabia to turtle up and start to snowball. As expected, Genghis DoWs me fairly early. Luckily I was prepared and I fight off his initial advance. He makes peace pretty quickly, and I just want out of the fight, so I make even peace, knowing it's just a stop gap. Since I now have a decent sized army, and ten turns of guaranteed peace with Genghis, I swing by China's settlements and kick them off my lawn. Smelling blood in the water, Genghis DoWs China and they're quickly irrelevant for the remainder of the game.  While Genghis is busy with China, I finally develop my infrastructure, get some exploration of the seas going, and meet France, who's already dominated the continent to the west of me. Another warmonger looking to get a foothold on my continent.   Soon after, it's war with Genghis again. This time it's not a contained border skirmish. He comes in with a full army of mounted units and is going to take my southern coastal city within a few turns. This is when I make the best move I've ever made in a game of Civ.  I sell Napoleon my buffer city and give him open borders for free. This immediately does two things.  1) It halts Genghis' march cold. With my gateway city now under the control of a neutral power, he can't get to me easily. Giving me time to develop an army and fight him off.  2) It gives Napoleon a beachhead on a new continent. Within 20 turns, his entire army is sailing east and landing on my shores to prepare for an offensive against everyone who isn't me.  Over the next 50 turns things get crazy. I beat Genghis for the final time, securing all of my important cities and coming out of the war in great shape with a strong economy. Napoleon DoWs on Arabia, who was cocky and totally unprepared for a surprise invasion. Harun loses multiple cities and is no longer the economic powerhouse he once was.  Eventually Napoleon turns his hungry gaze back my way, but I anticipated his inevitable betrayal, and am more than ready. Plus, I have a new ally: Genghis. Apparently I conducted myself so well in our last war that he has grown to respect me. We make a declaration of friendship while Napoleon was killing Harun, and because I never really attacked his cities, Genghis still has a ton of production and waste no time building his third army. My economy is booming, so I pay Genghis to attack Napoleon before he can attack me, and then I fund his entire war. We're talking oil, gold, tanks and planes. Anything Genghis asks for, I provide. I watch with glee as he wipes the floor with Napoleon and drives him back across the ocean. Genghis and I remain bffs for the entire rest of the game, and I eventually win a diplomatic victory, though I still consider it a joint effort.  tl;dr: Played Napoleon and Genghis Khan against each other like a fiddle and eventually because an economic superpower with Genghis as my personal attack dog.  Edit: Genghis not Attila"

With only one unit per city (3 cities, by the way), I thought I was done for. Then, just as my capital was under siege, I was able, with the help of my freedom-policy, to spawn six units of Foreign Legions. Suddenly, I had the bigger army and could easily push the invading Germans back to where they came from. Took one city, made peace and got a fair share of gold in return.  Morale of the story: Don't f**king mess with my luck!"
civ,3dw1j6,Toby_Macguire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:11 2015 UTC,"freedom-policy, to spawn six units of Foreign Legions   Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the Volunteer Army tenet is so fucking good.   As Arabia, I started on two salts, river and hill coastal city with three good places to settle, netting nice luxuries to trade out. I had a little problem, though - my neighbors were Alexander and Shaka. But!  I'm Arabia, so fuck it; I start selling my excess luxuries I get from the UA market, and I bribe Shaka to attack Alexander. Before Shaka is done with the war I push out Camel Archers, take Alexander's unprotected capital and reap the benefits of Shaka's war - he destroyed Greek units and took shitty cities, I got a capital with a wonder. The fact all my Camel Archers got +1 range and logistics was pretty damn nice, too. I got to finish off Alexander a little later, taking two decent cities and razing his final craptown. This guaranteed that every city-state within reach was my ally.   Shaka becomes friendly with me, we DoF and trade luxuries to each other. I dig into science and culture being certain Shaka will show aggression and attack me later, but I was adamant Camel Archers would just wipe out his army. Then the time comes: Shaka decides to redefine ""friendship"" into a very magical war, pushing out so many Impis that I started to fear for my third expanse - they were numerous and despite my Camel Archers' strength I would be hard pressed to stop this assault before I took major damage.  Freedom is a great ideology when you're playing tall and obsess over specialist slots and happiness, so I like to grab it often. This game was no exception, and as I was first to get three factories out it was an easy choice due to also getting the early adopter tenets. I was about to unlock another Policy when Shaka DoW'd.   I felt desperate, but then noticed the Adopt Policy shimmering like a divine gift. I instantly grabbed volunteer army, marched my 42 strength units into Shaka's now seemingly pathetic Impis and destroyed every single unit he had. I didn't end there, though - I had scouted enough of his territory to know he had a few good cities, so I pushed through his shitty border villages, burned them to the ground and went for his nicest things.  God damn Shaka."

civ,3dwh3n,yen223,11,Mon Jul 20 08:20:43 2015 UTC,"Awesomeness! Congrats! Curious, what did you change up to go from 219 to 181? Well, either way, that's a super impressive win. Further proof that Spain >>> all :)  Oh and nice getting the Great Library. I presume it was possible because of KSM?"
civ,3dwh3n,calze69,7,Mon Jul 20 05:49:17 2015 UTC,"A couple of things really.   I realised that it wasn't going to be possible to win when I started getting really close to the 200 mark (meaning I had to make sure I knew I would have it in the bag by turn 150~).  This mean't bulbing scientists pretty much straight away, readily declaring war and having the AI declare war on each other (paying Zulus 10  a turn hurts the bank but is worth it).   Hoping to get to internet reliably is really difficult, so I swapped from Order to Autocracy for the Futurism policy. I really focused on early game science (turns 100-120) but after getting a Public School in my capital it really makes little to no difference.   That is why I went for 6 cities as well, knowing I needed early science ASAP.   But the biggest determinant is whether an AI decides to steamroll culture and end up having 20K by turn ~190 because there is no way I can beat that.   KSM + Chop chop = GL"
civ,3dwh3n,yen223,6,Mon Jul 20 06:05:23 2015 UTC,"This is crazy I can barely ever pull culture victories off even on Prince, what's the secret?"
civ,3dwh3n,calze69,14,Mon Jul 20 05:48:29 2015 UTC,"Declare war on wonder whores and have the AI declare war on each other After universities I almost ignored science. I had the gold to buy public universities, but I decided I didn't need them and was better off buying museums and hotels. (Archaeologists made up the last 20 turns of production) Needed ideology ASAP for 250  per cultural great person. Managed to get it by around 145-150. Normal games I would get it at like 170+.  Autocracy is not advisable for the majority of CV or SV games. I generally prefer Order for CV's as it gives you % Great Person production, , critical % gold reduction on buildings and tourism bonuses as well (though I often take the Great Scientist and Engineer over the tier 3 one). Theme bonuses are critical. Sub-200 cultural victories are a bit different compared to normal ones as for any other play through I would rush the shit out of the Internet and International Games. They weren't a reality in this play through.  You need a science lead AND a production lead to get those wonders. Also you need to have archaeologists out 15 turns before everyone else."
civ,3dwh3n,DrCron,3,Mon Jul 20 06:10:05 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Have you ever tried a pure Autocracy Futurism tourism win? Where you don't generate any GA/GW/GM until ideologies, then pop them out instantly. I've always wondered whether it's feasible against Deity AIs with their massive culture output."
civ,3dwh3n,DrCron,3,Mon Jul 20 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"I think you would leave it way too late. The AI would end up being able to generate a lot more culture than you could ever produce from that tenant. Like if they make it to 10K culture (easy for deity turn ~200) you would have to spawn 40 GA/GW/GM in a very short period. Not possible.   e: Wait I'm not thinking, I thought you meant without ever building up tourism per turn... Idk why I thought that. Yeah it could work, but you are looking at going for a CV by ~250 or so, unless you go crazy with archaeologists."
civ,3dwh3n,TathanOTS,3,Mon Jul 20 07:01:34 2015 UTC,"Wait I'm not thinking, I thought you meant without ever building up tourism per turn...    Actually that's what I meant lol. The idea is to hold off generating GA/GW/GMs (i.e. no great works at all) until you hit Radio and get Futurism, then immediately spawn all the great people as fast as possible for the +250 bonus.  I suspect this may only work on Quick speed, since the +250 tourism isn't scaled. Although against the AI with their insane cultural production, who knows.  I do know that Autocracy Futurism works in quick-speed multiplayer. Indeed, it is the only realistic way to get a tourism victory there."
civ,3dwh3n,Holyrootbeer,2,Mon Jul 20 07:47:02 2015 UTC,"My mind betrayed me.   Yeah, it could be doable on quick speed. You definitely would need a city with gardens, national epic, Aesthetics and the LToP.   Acutally! It would work amazingly with the Brazilians! An additional 50% during golden ages if timed right (Taj Mahal, Aesthetics Golden Age).   Also you would need a really decent faith pool to buy at least 3-4 great musicians, also probably need the wonders giving GA/GW/GMs as well."

Ships can go onto pontoon bridge tiles, so it doesn't do any land conversion. The main problem was the converting land to water bit - the graphics refused to (and still don't) change. If you want to see this, open up a game with IGE and start changing terrain - most doesn't load, and so IGE has to reload the world (save, then open up the savefile) to make them render. Doing this every time you build a polder would be madness."

civ,3dwsh3,tempolevy,37,Mon Jul 20 04:35:31 2015 UTC,"This is obvious, but reroll until you have a decent start if you are having trouble with surviving the early game in Deity. You can opt to not restart if you think it's cheaty, Deity is still winnable even with crappy Tundra starting locations (I've won with a start that had almost no hammers in the nearby tiles), it just is more annoying to do so.  If you are having problems with standard game pace, try Epic or Marathon game pace. You have a lot more time for combat and exploration as well as decision-making.  You can win with every civ. Don't handicap yourself by relying on the bonuses of specific civilizations to win Deity. I always randomize the civ I get and playing to their strengths will almost always net you a victory.  If you don't spawn near a natural wonder that gives a ton of Faith or find Faith ruins (quite unlikely in Deity with Pangaea/Continent maps due to the AI tending to clear most ruins out before turn 20), don't even bother getting a religion. You will not make it and the production is better spent elsewhere.  Never give anyone open borders except in extreme situations where it would actually benefit you, such as a militarily dominant close ally who needs to move through your territory to fight a civ you're both at war with. You can just buy open borders from the AI for 1 gold per turn.  By turn 80-100 you should know which type of victory you are going for, though for me personally a Domination victory is the go-to bread and butter for winning on Deity. Usually if you own a civilization so hard they're practically begging for a peace treaty (when they stop asking for you to pay them cities to sign a peace deal, they're getting desperate), you can extort them for a lot of luxuries as well as absolutely ludicrous amounts of gold per turn, which not only cripples them but also makes you that much stronger.  Rush science as much as you can without compromising your military power. You absolutely do NOT want to fall behind in technology as science = military might. Usually you will become the technology leader of the world at ~30 or so total technologies, if you plan your research agreements/great scientists well. Use Oxford to rush Modern Era, if you are very lucky you may actually beat the AIs to adopting an ideology giving you 1 or 2 free tenets.  AIs have a TON of gold on Deity and you can almost immediately sell any luxuries for 7 gold per turn and maybe some extra flat gold if you have positive diplomatic relations with that civilization. I typically sell for flat gold. This is part of how you can catch up to the AIs - trade with them! Plan long sieges by building roads and forts. You can always pillage them later once you don't want to pay the upkeep anymore.  Use your spies effectively. Send them to your capital and city-states once you are the technology leader.  Always keep a few AIs friendly and try to bribe them to go to war with other AIs. Don't bother fully eliminating an AI that you declare war on, just capture their capital and move on. When done early it sets them so far behind that you can keep them down for the rest of the game, using an embargo proposal if necessary.  Even if your neighbor is someone aggressive like Montezuma or Napoleon they will not necessarily be tempted to declare war on you. Manage your diplomatic relationships and don't declare war for no reason.  If a warmongering civ puppeted/annexed city-states, go liberate those city states for free city-state alliances. City-state control is extremely important to prevent AIs from rolling over you in the World Congress, if you do not have a closely allied civ who shares your interests.    And some underhanded anti-AI strategies:    The AI isn't smarter on Deity, only stronger. They will do dumb things like move their most expensive units into bombardment range of your artilleries, so abuse that.  The key to beating a superior military is abusing the dumb AI (at least, until they get bombers, at which point they become slightly more annoying to deal with). I managed to get Genghis Khan to suicide his entire army into my choke point of 3 artilleries, 1 infantry, and 2 crossbowmen, after which his cities rolled over with little resistance.  If you manage to take a city with luxuries/strategic resources but your enemy has the forces to take it back immediately the next turn, sell all of them for flat gold. When the city changes hands again, your trade deals will cancel and you can sell the luxuries again the next turn. This has zero influence on your diplomatic relationship with the civ you're scamming, and on Deity the AIs that snowballed early on will have five digits of gold by midgame so you can milk them pretty hard.  Even in the Atomic Era the AIs will still happily buy iron and horses from you for pretty solid amounts of gold. Strategic resource tiles are basically 5-10 gold per turn once connected since you can afford to sell most/all of them, as you should receive more than enough coal/oil/aluminium/etc. from allied city-states."

civ,3dwsh3,arbyq5000,7,Mon Jul 20 07:11:02 2015 UTC,"The important thing is to use the free tech to save as much time as possible, so you can rush Electricity with it if the situation calls for it, though I often just wait to use it for Radio instead as it is worth more science and that unlocking electricity does not directly cause future research to become easier, unlike getting into a new Era.   Rushing Modern Era accomplishes several other things besides military/tech improvements and allowing your ideology adoption:    Increases the city-state bonuses you receive.  Decreases the cost of researching the remaining technologies in the previous Era. Gives you another spy.    Obviously it does cause other problems such as making your research agreements cost more (and for civilizations that are significantly behind you, makes them less willing to sign them in the first place) and making your subsequent great works not match in Era for theming bonuses, but those are not usually a problem and the benefits of rushing an Era"

civ,3dwsh3,100centuries,2,Mon Jul 20 11:09:57 2015 UTC,"Ideologies can be problematic to adopt if your civilization is not allowed to turtle and tech safely, and several things can cause that to happen, either from spawning near an annoying neighbor like Shaka (or from them spawning on the other side of the world and wiping out another AI, snowballing their army/tech in the process), or from being forced to go to war due to a rival civilization having a gigantic tourism lead that will snowball into a win if you don't conquer them now. AIs with different ideologies will cause happiness problems if their tourism pressure is high, so if you aren't the first adopter you should just adopt whatever ideology they rolled with (unless it's bad for your planned win condition) to avoid negative diplomatic modifiers, and unhappiness issues from ideological pressure."

civ,3dwsh3,redooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:29 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't we give open borders? Is it because others could potentially settle near you?
civ,3dwsh3,Mech07rs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:21:36 2015 UTC,"Giving the AI open borders has a direct consequence of increasing their tourism to you, though the real reason why this is a bad idea is the fact that giving them open borders benefits the AI but gives you nothing aside from a negligible positive diplomatic modifier. Hell, even giving embassies can be a bad idea since the AIs will likely start coveting your land (and will almost certainly happen if you give them open borders). Plus if the AI decides to move their army through your territory it is really annoying if you're trying to build improvements.   There are plenty of other ways to get positive relations with a civilization; nobody will be exceptionally pissed off due to you not giving open borders, and if you want the AI to give you open borders, you can just trade them 1 gold per turn instead of trading your own open borders with them.   Denying open borders could also be very beneficial if you spawn on a choke point. Let's use the Americas in the real world as a simplified example: Let's say you're Mexico, and you don't give the United States open borders. Now you're free to do whatever the hell you want with Central and South America, and they are none the wiser, not to mention they have literally no way to stop you or compete with you even if they did want to go there. (Unless they're Polynesia; fucking Kamehameha and his cities metastasizing all over the entire map before you can even research optics pisses me off to no end)"

I'm not going to go off on an elaborate breakdown of everything wrong with Beyond Earth - plenty of people have already done that. I will however mention my main issues with the game that keep me from coming back:   Victories are pretty boring and essentially the same thing. They all involve producing particular buildings and simply waiting.  Diplomacy sucks big time, and favors are close to worthless. I'm glad they've decided to overhaul it in Rising Tides. It feels like vanilla Civ V's diplomacy, only worse. The Sponsor's themselves are also extremely boring and there's simply not enough of them. In Civ V I love to crowd my maps with a ton of Civ's - you simply can't do that in BE which is very unfortunate.  The Aliens are fairly boring and not very diverse. The global anger system is pretty punishing if the AI's in your game decide to be total assholes. While I'm mentioning units, I personally don't like what they've done with the unit promotion system. I liked being able to have the same type of unit be diverse depending on the combat promotions I award them. For example, a ranged vs. a logistics gatling gun have two very different purposes in combat. Instead, every unit type gets the same global promotions that you choose and the only promotions they get from experience is the ability to raise their combat strength by 10% 3 times, followed by healing them.  The color scheme of the game is very dull. You may think I'm nitpicking, but I'm almost convinced (as are many others) that the game's boring colors contribute to making the game feel less alive, and in turn reducing its replayability even more. And what's with that minimap? A great part of Civ V is admiring the map and the constant change of borders - in Beyond Earth it's so dark it's hard to tell anything apart, much less get any satisfaction out of it. Most of the wonders simply aren't worth building.  While espionage is cool at first, it gets extremely repetitive and isn't very rewarding. The removal of big things like tourism and faith is also a huge disappointment, as it isn't replaced by anything else. They are adding Artifacts in Rising Tides, so it should be interesting to see how those play out.    In short, Beyond Earth didn't really add anything new to the series. Sure it's on an alien planet and it contains some alien bugs, but Affinities end up being a replacement for Ideologies and everything else is copied over or left out. It just feels dumbed down even from vanilla Civ V - no demographics, global politics screen to quickly see what every AI has to trade, etc. I do however have high hopes for the expansion - although it's a bit pricey, what they've presented so far seems like it just might be worth the money."
civ,3dvl30,Meltdown267,15,Mon Jul 20 00:56:10 2015 UTC,Your forgetting luxuries resources. Without them there is almost no point to having a diplomacy system since there isn't really anything to trade.

Some are better, but they took a step backwards for every one they improved.  For example the Gene Vault is in my opinion pretty terrible now. Why rush a wonder early-game just to give you some free worker units in every new city, when you won't be able to actually reap its rewards for a very long time since health is so difficult to maintain early-game? And by that time, you likely already have alot of workers or have the ability to purchase new ones very easily.

The tech web and affinity points take some time to grasp (often I find myself completely unsure of what to research next) but as far as gameplay goes it's good. I found the alien enemies OP at times (siege worms wtf) but definitely manageable.   One thing to keep in mind is that unhappiness isn't quite as detrimental to your game as in Civ 5; you can usually keep a strong game going when your unhappiness (health in this game) is -9 or higher.
civ,3dvl30,CheeseburgerLocker,2,Sun Jul 19 23:35:29 2015 UTC,It's not a bad game however it is still unpolished.  You can play it now and enjoy yourself although many glaring issues will be staring you in the face until the expansions.

civ,3dvl30,millerz1897,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:51 2015 UTC,I'd say yes. Most of the complaints of it apply to Civ V anyway because BE is really just sci-fi Civ V. I think they were too cautious and didn't change enough but I'd say it is worth playing. The tech-web alone makes it worth playing.  I hope they add more with a DLC like they did for BNW.
civ,3dvl30,Hooj19,4,Mon Jul 20 16:49:56 2015 UTC,"Considering that I actually liked Vannilla Civ 5, BE was great.  I highly recommend to anyone who likes 4x games in general, even if Civ only fans might not like it as much!"

The trick, besides getting a little lucky, is to settle into a nice defensive position with 3 cities and play the science game. Find a civ who everyone else hates and who isn't adjacent to you, and steal the crap out of his technologies. Your goal is to catch up to the other civs by Industrial Era so you can start producing Artillery, pick up Autocracy, and wage war (or defend) until you get Logistics upgrades for 4-6 Artillery. From there get some Infantry and AA guns for support, and slowly push your way to victory. The AI may have 2-4x your military strength, but that doesn't matter since it doesn't know how to use its units well.  To help survive the constant attacks and backstabs from AI in the earlier eras, I used a 4th city (it was the 2nd one I built) as a buffer zone which I knew was going to be overrun eventually. Before the city fell to the invading AI horde, I gave the city away to the tech leader who was on the other side of the map. No one wanted to go to war with him to get to me, so I basically had 100-150 turns of undisturbed growth.

You can set up an alert so that they'll email you any time a game drops below a certain price.  One place they don't monitor is Mac Game Store, which is a shame because they do Civ V deals all the frickin' time. I just checked them while writing this post, and yeah, Complete is currently on sale there for $12.50.  Don't let the ""Mac"" thing bother you. You're buying a Steam game code, nothing more and nothing less. Once you plug the code into Steam, it'll be cross-platform. Civ V is Steamworks and, aside from a weird Applestore-only version (""Campaign Edition"") it's cross platform no matter where you (legitimately) buy it from.  Also, as others have said, Complete includes both expansions and all the DLC. It's kind of bizarre that they price the expansions at $30/each when Complete is $50 and includes them+more..."

Have fun, and hope you enjoy it :)  A lot of people will disagree with me, but if you want my take- You might want to play G&K a bit before BNW first, though of course it's really up to you.  I feel like G&K is very similar to a vastly improved version of Vanilla. They fix a lot of the annoying things, add new stuff that feels intuitive, etc. It's basically ""Vanilla but fixed.""  BNW on the other hand was a bit more revolutionary, and while I do think it's a solid add-on that gives more than it takes, in some ways it's kinda ""two steps forward, one step back."" It has a very, very different feel from G&K and in my opinion is actually quite a bit easier (I struggled as much on G&K Emperor as I do on BNW Deity.)  Again, BNW is a solid addon and you'll have a ton of fun if you jump straight to it. Just mentioning that it's a valid option to disable it for a bit if you want. In particular it depends on what you want. G&K is more of a war game- warring is easier and the AI is much more aggressive. BNW, by comparison, makes it easier to play peacefully (which is actually my preferred style, and probably why I find it a lot easier).  In either case, have fun :)"

civ,3dvf7p,friendshabitsfamily,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"But would they continue to feel like they got a good deal even after they find out that they're still missing like $100ish of standalone DLC, and that if they want to pick that up, buying Complete would still be their cheapest option?  It totally makes sense to have the package deal be slightly cheaper than the individual parts, in fact it would be crazy to do otherwise. It's just that the standalone DLC provides enough (frankly overpriced) filler that Complete would still be the best deal even if the expansions were only like $10-15 each."
civ,3dvf7p,friendshabitsfamily,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on what, exactly, they already have is all.  Prices aren't just made up out of nowhere, ya know.

I recommend that you try it if only for a breath of fresh air from the vanilla game.  But another expansion pack at this point is very, very unlikely. A new Civ game is also some years away as Firaxis would rather dedicate their resources at the moment to fixing Beyond Earth and adding new DLCs for it."

civ,3dw591,lucidzero,4,Mon Jul 20 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"Simple. I'd want the AI system overhauled. Especially diplomacy. I think that's the area where the game is the most messed up. The fact that the AI can do whatever it wants with no consequences, but you can't, makes zero sense. They settle new cities, they spread their religion, they keep spying, all of this when they said they wouldn't? They should have a severe penalty for that, such as negative diplomatic modifiers with all the other AIs, that can eventually lead to them being denounced and isolated. That, or you can act like the AI and have no penalties for doing all the above.  I'd also fix happiness. I think the AI on higher difficulties getting the happiness boost is ridiculous. I only play on King, and it's very hard to ever get the AI down into negative happiness for long, even when they have a ridiculous amount of cities.  I'd fix the Piety social policy tree and make it a relevant option to open with for some civs.  I'd change Tradition back to how it was, removing the need to get Oligarchy before Legalism.  And on top of all that, I'd fix and balance some of the civs. Ones that come to mind would be America, Denmark, Iroquois, & Byzantium.  Oh, also, I don't know if it only happens to me, but I'd stop city states from constantly spawning next to every single god damn natural wonder on the map.  It would be cool to add new civs, but you can already do that with mods. Israel, Australia, & Cherokee all come to mind as civs I'd love to see added. I think Native American tribes could use a bit more representation."
civ,3dw591,Yurya,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:24 2015 UTC,Well there is also /r/nqmod if you want a balance mod that works with Multiplayer/Achievements.  But to answer the question directly: I'd like a third expansion.

civ,3du3sh,Super_C_Complex,57,Sun Jul 19 14:10:02 2015 UTC,I'd like to see more possibilities with water on the tiles. maybe in the late game you could have Wind and algae farms.

civ,3du3sh,maxis2k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"Just today, I was wondering if they could expand on rivers.  Maybe have an early precursor to the Harbor, like a 'Dock' building, that would work for cities next to a river.  And give you one gold per river adjacent tile.  Basically, return the way river tiles worked in Civ V Vanilla, giving one gold per river tile, but require a building to trigger it.  Maybe even expanding rivers to allow for naval trade routes.  Also, hitting on your tundra idea, I've really wonder why there isn't a Tundra specific wonder that improves Tundra tiles, like how Petra improves Desert.  I reason they probably don't do it because a Tundra tile is technically the same as a plains already.  And could possibly make Russia really ridiculous.  But hey, just an idea.  It would certainly make me keep more Tundra starts.  As for an original idea, this isn't exactly a building but...I'd like to see more variety in natural wonders.  Maybe adding in a number of pre 5000 BC wonders like Gobekli Tepe or Carnac.  Obviously they can't be built since they predate the 5,000 BC starting point of a normal game.  But they could be found on the map (much like El Dorado can be found in the current game)."
civ,3du3sh,Cananadia,22,Mon Jul 20 05:48:45 2015 UTC,Fish and Whales already have the lighthouse and seaport that make them very powerful resources.

It's dumb to not be able to build a navy because the city isn't built on the coast. Also you can still work the fish tiles despite not being on the coast so you be able to build a lighthouse.

If it grows, it will place the new citizen directly after the food yields are evaluated and before all the other yields are evaluated. So, the new citizen will grant you all yields from its tile except food yields, which were already evaluated.  Of course, you want maximal yield from that new citizen. Since the food yield isn't granted in the turn the new citizen appears, you want the tile to have as many other yields as possible. Setting city management to standard of food will most of the time set the new citizen on a high food tile, but food tiles aren't granted for the turn of appearence. Setting city management on production will set the new citizen on a high production tile instead, whose yields won't be wasted."
civ,3dwoa1,Blackheart595,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:05:45 2015 UTC,"To clarify a bit further: just clicking ""food"" in the City screen will not rearrange how your citizens work the tiles and put them on the tiles with the most food.   The strategy laid out here is to go and manually select those tiles by hand, then select production as the focus. Like /u/Blackheart595 said, focusing city management on production means that the next citizens born will be put to work on the tile with the most production.  In terms of citizen management, though, I wouldn't trust your ""governor"" blindly. Sometimes you get a better balance of food/production by locking specific tiles, then going back and changing them, like if you're at war you might prioritize a production/gold tile over a production/food tile. Stuff like that."

You should be manually assigning food tiles early. When your city gains a population, it automatically works the max production tile since you set it to production focus, and then you reassign that tile to a food tile. This basically gives you 2 free production than if you assigned it default focus, where it would work a food tile and not give your city any production. This is basically a minmax strategy to maximise your gains."

civ,3dwr9h,Madhairman12,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:11 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, REXing (rapid expansion) spamming out a lot of citys until you can't anymore this usually happens around the 60-70% gold slider. (Land is power)  Siege units are critical for warfare.  Cottage spam is a good way to make an economy with not so much micro.  Try to follow the most popular religon the AIs use.  Don't neglect your military, the AI will notice this and dog pile you if you just sit around building wonders.  It's a really deep game, I hope this helps somewhat."

civ,3dwr9h,DrCron,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't play in over a year, but let's see if I can remember basic tips:   You'll settle more cities than Civ5 but less than Civ3, especially in the early game, since they cost gold to mantain (the 60% gold slider mentioned in the previous comment is a good indicator you need to stop growing). Catapults are great for early war. You'll probably do your first attack with catapults and sword men (you need iron for them). Cities don't defend themselves, you should have at least 1 unit garrisoned in almost every city (except maybe internal cities in a large empire) almost all the time. You can, and should, stack units for war. Building a worker early is good for fast chopping, which might be even more important than in Civ5. An early scout is not so important. If you don't have a good up to date military the AI will attack you, even in Noble difficulty. Since cities are easier to invade, it will destroy you. So even if you are going for a peaceful cultural victory, keep some strong, updated, defensive units available. There are basically 2 ways to play the game: Cottage Economy (CE) and Specialist Economy (SE). CE is easier and it's based on spamming cottages to get gold. Start with that one, and pick a ""financial"" leader to get more gold. When you go up in difficulty (starting at Prince) you can change to SE. In this case you'll have more farms than cottages, and use the extra food for specialists. Get a ""philosophical"" leader for more great people. Setting the great people in the cities is better than a one-time use of them, at least until the late game.   And I think that's it. The first difficulty that challenges you a bit is ""noble"", so you can play anything below that the first time, to learn the game mechanics, and you might win even in your first game. Enjoy, Civ4 is an awesome game, with so many great mods that you can play nothing else for years (literally)."

Got engineering for aqueduct (cuz you have to build them when you go liberty). Then the standard science beeline. Of course I prioritize science buildings in my cities and use specialists, I also use internal food trade routes to feed the cities because food=city population=science.

Remember your strengths when going wide are production so build up the barracks and stuff for strong units that can compete with higher tech units.  Important policies to get are:   the road connections one from Liberty.   The cheaper roads from commerce.  Extra science from universities  To note: even if you go wide, if you have lots of happiness and your cities are all very good (ie have lots of buildings) freedom is still the right choice.

Wonders such as Circus Maximus and Notre Dame add to global happiness. Also, UNIQUE (first copy only) luxuries add 4 global happiness. Happiness that is GIVEN from policies are also global happiness. By this, I mean Aristocracy and Meriocracy GIVE happiness while Monarchy MODIFIES happiness.  Happiness can fluctuate wildly. I had a game where I was growing 4 cities very well and my happiness made it all the way to 0. Then I discovered a natrual wonder for a Mercantile CS that I was friends with.

Food is one of the cornerstones of many cultures, and as an American, I can totally see why you would think otherwise. In very international and colony-based countries (like many EU countries, America, Canada, England, etc.), food is very diverse and is not tied to culture. In countries with strong culinary traditions and largely one ethnic group (such as Japan, China, Mexico, Italy, etc.), food goes hand and hand with culture and tradition.

civ,3dqtzg,Doctor_of_Recreation,3,Sat Jul 18 20:41:47 2015 UTC,Not that great on civ. The one for ck2 is great though!
civ,3dqtzg,7V3N,2,Sat Jul 18 22:14:11 2015 UTC,I actually admit I haven't played CK2. Civ Revolution into Civ V was my introduction to these types of games. I've since become much more of a PC gamer. Do I need to get CK2? :)
civ,3dqtzg,Doctor_of_Recreation,12,Sat Jul 18 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"It depends. CK2 is a RTS though plays more like a TBS since you can pause and play, and it's more about committing different actions and allowing consequences to play out in time--whether it's a marriage alliance, plotting to develop a claim, rebelling against your liege, or even just getting good qualities in your family line (attractive, strong, etc.). The ASOIAF mod is devoted to book canon and uses all resources at its disposal (including newly added lore from the World book). The ruler designer (DLC which allows you to create your own ruler rather than using ones pre-set through history) allows you to try some crazy situations for you to play with.  Definitely check out some gameplay before you buy it, as it is not for everyone. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it with 1005 hours on it. I play almost exclusively with the Game of Thrones mod (though ASOIAF would be more fitting since it is, as I said, book-canon). I have played as Littlefinger, simply out for chaos and personal profit; I have played as Stannis in AFFC, trying to win the North and then the Iron Throne. I have played as Jon Snow, taking the name Stark in service to Stannis and reestablishing Winterfell under Starks once again; I have played as Tywin, fighting against Robert Baratheon and plotting to manipulate the Targaryens and put Lannisters in prime positions of power.  So. Much. Fun.  Edit: Totally forgot to say this! Check out /r/CK2GameOfthrones. We tend to post stories about our playthroughs, crazy things that happened, and what we did to change events. I tend to enjoy reading a lot of them."
civ,3dqtzg,7V3N,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the frank and thorough input. I will definitely do as you suggest and watch some gameplay before looking into getting it for myself. Appreciate your time, man."
civ,3dqtzg,Doctor_of_Recreation,4,Sun Jul 19 00:22:13 2015 UTC,"No problem at all! I personally love the game and would love for others to enjoy it too, but I would never want to sell someone on a game that just isn't for them."
civ,3dqtzg,7V3N,2,Sun Jul 19 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna add another voice of support for CK2 (both vanilla and the GOT mode). It's a fantastic game. The Horse Lords DLC just released is apparently super unbalanced, but that will presumably get patched soon.  I'm taking a break from it for the moment, got a bit of fatigue, now playing Civ again. But I'd rate CK2 the better game."

civ,3dqtzg,Cmndr_Duke,22,Sat Jul 18 18:53:13 2015 UTC,This is correct. I use R.E.D. and then R.E.D. Xtreme to make them even smaller. This is incompatible with a lot of unit mods however so I wouldn't recommend it if you use those.

Other than that, grab all the order policies and try to grab as many happiness wonders as you can.  Oh, another tip, as Spain it is a really good idea to expand south through Africa! The fountain of youth is apparently in north-west africa, near the sea. That will give you 20 happiness if worked. Conquistadors can't settle in Africa though because Europe and Africa in this mod are connected(learned this the hard way) so use a regular settler."

civ,3ds260,Nolifegod,8,Sun Jul 19 12:10:16 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're serious... Wheat tiles have extra food, so you can get your population, and thus science, rolling faster. Salt is the best resource in the game, because it's a luxury, it's accessible at mining, and it gives extra food and production when mined. A salt mine on plains gives 3, 2 and 1, which us an awesome early game tile. And this city has several of them. Marble is also a good resource because it is a luxury and speeds up building wonders.  In addition to that, the city starts on a hill (added initial production), next to a mountain (observatory possible later, giving yet more science) and on a river (garden for faster great people, hydro dam for late game production, and better farms). One of the best start locations I've ever seen."
civ,3ds260,seemedlikeagoodplan,2,Sun Jul 19 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"Oh. I did not think salt was that good. However, the mountain/river start isn't that uncommon? The wheat and the sheep rare either."

A hill next to a mountain is super common. A hill next to a mountain and river is pretty common. A hill next to a mountain and river, with 3 salt and 2 wheat nearby, plus another luxury, that's pretty rare."
civ,3ds260,darth_taco_117,4,Mon Jul 20 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hill start - a little extra bit of production early, a little extra bit of defense.  Mountain start - observatories give 50% science output boost. OP plays Babylon, so a one of two strongest science-oriented civs.  Triple salt - 3 food, 2 production, 1 gold tile after discovering mining, further boosted by other technologies.  River - extra food from tiles near it after civil service. And wheat on one of those, so 3 food 1 production tile from get-go.  Marble - a little extra oomph if he would try to snipe some early wonders.  Generally - nice mix of production and food tiles."

civ,3dszyg,namo2021,10,Sun Jul 19 12:54:21 2015 UTC,"Defense and production are two factors for settling on the hill. Also some buildings are better when you have more water tiles, by doing this you do have more. OP would have gotten the gold anyway through border expansion and you can still work three tiles out from the city. Salt is good because it is a luxury that gives production, food, and I think gold. You can also trade it like the others."

civ,3dszyg,PM_ME_CHIMICHANGAS,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yup. Settling on a gold hill (or gems, silver, copper) is best because you get the extra production from the hill plus the GPT from the luxury, and you also get the bonus happiness as soon as you research mining. No need to waste turns on a worker improving it, and you get the yields without taking a citizen off your food titles, which can stunt your growth early on.  Honorary mention goes to plantation luxuries like cotton or dyes, because of the bonus gold per turn from them as well. Not as early with the happiness boost, and you don't get any bonus hammers either. I should point out that you almost never want to settle on a salt tile. Right next to one, sure. But you don't get the bonus yields from improving the luxury when you settle on top of it so what would be a 3 food 2 hammer 1 gold tile will just be a 2 food 1 hammer 1 gold capitol."
civ,3dszyg,elbay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:00:27 2015 UTC,"There are luxuries you'd rather not settle on, like marble. Marble gives you a bonus to wonders that you cannot get if you settle on it. You shouldn't settle on salt or citrus either. These are probably the only luxuries you shouldn't settle on. Other than that settling on all luxes is better.   (P.s i am not certain about the marble thing, but i'm feeling confident)"

civ,3dszyg,O_the_Scientist,3,Sun Jul 19 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"Just want to add that it prevents building a windmill in that city later in the game. IMO the two production early at the cost of a windmill later is worth it, but just something people should keep in mind."

civ,3dszyg,pipkin42,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"I think most players prefer the river. If you're going wide and militaristic you could probably make a case for the hill, though."

Second and third cities as you will have problems improving them right away (not enough workers) - benefit far more from hills.  In later eras (after you discover windmill), avoid hills if you can buy the windmill when the city is founded.  not many cities will be founded that late by you in general - and those that you do often should have 4 or so buildings bought to speed up their growth (granary, aqueduct, workshop, windmill)."

Have capital build regular build order, scout, monument then build the settler you want to use build then either a worker or a granary.  Research pottery, mining usually, then writing.    Settle city at petra spot and build a library first, then a granary.  Meanwhile research calendar and sailing.  Use the sea trade route from sailing to feed your soon-to-be-petra city.  It needs this food to work production tiles to quickly build petra.  Move a worker over to the city and build mines on any hills available.    Now you should have two reasonably high production cities with libraries and sea trade routes running through.  If your planned petra city is inland I can't help you because I've never tried for an inland petra on anything above king.  You can tech for natural college, build it, then tech to petra and build that, or you can tech to petra, meanwhile settle third or fourth city, and while petra is building build your libraries in those cities."

civ,3dwbyb,DushkuHS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:38 2015 UTC,"My usual strategy is to go tradition, three cities and NC by turn 100.   Why only 3 cities? If there's no room for a 4th, 3 will work. But starting off aiming for sub-par doesn't seem like a formula for victory, eh? I'm not judging; I'm still learning the game. I pull off 4 cities and NC before 100 all the time on Emperor."
civ,3dwbyb,DushkuHS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on space and luxuries. On Immortal the AI can expand very rapidly and take up all the good spots. I usually only get a fourth city if I get a population ruin and can pump out settlers quicker. Otherwise I'll get three, prioritise NC and then either stick with that or take the nearest capital, depending on the diplomatic consequences.  I may not be prioritising settlers enough, but a bit of army and a caravan is important for dealing with barbs and getting early game science as well (right at the start a caravan will net you more science than your NC)."
civ,3dwbyb,DushkuHS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:49 2015 UTC,"My bad. I thought you were saying that was your plan of attack, not just what you're able to manage in the face of AI resistance.  I'm not the most experienced Civ player, but I disagree (generally speaking) with your build priorities. I'd like to flesh that out a bit to either help you or learn from you :)  I usually build two Scouts to start with. Combined with the Warrior, this is 3 military units even if 2 are weak. Once I scout far enough out, I bring the Scouts back in. I try to grab a free worker or two along the way if possible. I bring them home to help with the protection of workers and/or escort Settlers if my Warrior is busy. Once I have my expands up, then I'll allow my Scouts to resume scouting.  Often, one of those Scouts becomes an Archer. At which point I'll have my capital build another. The point is that your lands are going to be well enough defended against barbs most of the time just from city bombardment and Scout who is defending. If I have a city with 2 camps nearby that have nobody else to harass, then I might tech Archery and build (buy in emergencies) an Archer or two. I'll also tech that way if I forward settle an AI and make that my first build in the forward settle.  Otherwise, my expands are building Libraries first. Then the two oldest/nearest (if not all 3) expands will build Granaries. Then the two highest production ones will build trade routes to feed the capital. By this time, I've usually got enough workers and happiness to survive the sudden influx of food in the capital.  With this approach (and knowing when you have to pump out your first Settler quickly), I can often get up at least 3 expands on Emperor. All the while, gaining/protecting workers, repelling barbs, establishing diplomatic relations, and ramping up an army to dissuade against early attacks.  How does this compare with your experiences? How are you managing to prioritize caravans over settlers and still have that equate to science without tanking in happiness?"
civ,3dwbyb,DushkuHS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:12 2015 UTC,"My first build is scout, monument, then either another scout or a shrine/granary depending on how much terrain I've scouted, whether I've found some good exapansion spots, and whether or not I want a religion. I steal a worker from a CS asap as well.  It's good to have at like two military units by the time you expand because if you leave barb camps along for too long they will start to spam horsemen and become a serious threat to your workers, pillaging improvements and what not. You can't just defend your land with city bombardments. They aren't strong enough and if barbs come and pillage your improvements you will fall behind on everything. On higher difficulties it's important to have the right improvements and to be able to micromanage your citizens in order to produce what you need to at the right times. If barbs are constantly pillaging your shit then it's hard to do this.  Once I'm at pop four or five in the capital I'll start to expand as quickly as I can. The limitations on this are basically the terrain and the AI. Each city needs to have at least one luxury I don't already have to pay for itself in terms of happiness. If it doesn't have another unique lux then it needs something else - a mountain, a river, or maybe a bunch of hills so that it can become a mad production city. But it needs to have something going for it otherwise it's not worth the growth, or the production put into the settler when I could be building something else. All expands will start by building libraries.  At some point I'll want a caravan. This will happen well before I have NC. On higher difficulties the AI starts with so much more pop and science than you that you can get five science per turn from a single caravan. That is a big difference. In terms of happiness, I don't see the problem. Happiness is basically about having the right lux and enough workers to improve it, plus a couple of friendly AI that you can trade with.  In my current game as Arabia on Immortal I got three cities, petra and national college at turn 108. The early caravan was crucial to this. It meant that I got to philosophy quicker, and NC allowed me to beeline to currency in time to get petra in my capital. I have now beelined camel archers. Napoleon and Pacal both declared on me with better science (Napoleon has gunpowder units), but I am holding them off without a problem, have built a fourth city, and will eventually take Pacal's capital. I'm still behind on science but once I do that I'll be in a position to either continue with domination or turtle for a spaceship."

The extra science and production you get from population is almost always worth more than the benefits from a golden age."

If you went Tradition, each pop in your capital gives 0.5 gold, 0.5 happiness, and slightly more science from the National College just for existing.   For other cities, you should grow them up to your available local happiness and workable tiles limit. This is especially a concern if you go wide, as in lots of low-pop cities, because you will be very happiness-starved, and the city probably won't expand its borders fast enough anyway.  If you have tons of excess happiness, you should always think about expanding. It's almost never worth keeping happiness for golden ages. The brief golden ages is not worth the longer periods between golden ages where you aren't producing as much as you could be."

Every tech that has been researched by a civ you've already met is cheaper for you to research.  You also get to steal more and better techs with spies.  On emperor, the AI does not start with as much of a tech lead as they do on immortal or deity, so you surpass them faster, which, counterintuitively, slows your research speed.  That being said:  with 4 cities on emperor, assuming you build national college by turn 100, you will be between 50 and 80 science.    A benchmark that I always look for is ""when does my science per turn overtake the actual turn number?"" On deity, standard speed, I aim for 130 science by turn 130.  On emperor 160 by turn 160 is more realistic.  This generally happens once you have universities built and those specialist slots filled.  Continents maps will slow you down too since it takes longer to meet everyone.  I try to build research labs by turn 240 or sooner and bulb scientists by 250 at the latest.

civ,3ds8ne,Imperator,47,Sat Jul 18 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"Ya know what? I came here for the express purpose of ranting about just this topic.  Initially I liked how religion worked in Civ5 (compared to Civ4) but now I think I hate it.  The pattern is inevitably this:   I found a religion and spread it across my continent; 100 turns later someone on my content founds a religion. Oh yay. I know what's coming. They then spend all their faith on Great Prophets to convert their cities (which I don't mind) and also mine. They get shitty when I use Inquisitors or Great Prophets to convert back; In the mid-game a Great Prophet will arrive from over the sea and start converting my cities. This just happened in a game today. A Great Prophet has 4 shots. After the first I declared war, killed the Great Prophet (because I'm not dealing with this shit) and 10 turns later they offer peace including giving me one of their cities, which was weird; Because of the religious tensions with one of my neighbours he starts sending a swarm of troops (""nothing to see here, move along""). Of course I know what's coming. He declares war, I beat him back. The only way to deal with this crap is to capture the holy city of the other religion, which is obviously the capital. Capture the capital and now everyone hates me because I'm apparently a warmonger. WTF?   In Civ4 I would often research the religious techs just so the AI wouldn't start some pain in the ass religion on my doorstep. There's no way around it in Civ5 though. You can't found multiple religions.  And it still bugs me you can't raze city states or capitals. I hate that shit.  There needs to be a way to diplomatically or covertly keep that shit out of your empire. And more generally the AI needs to better appreciate provocation.  In my current game (as the Austrians), Spain early on captured India's capital. I'm like sure whatever, go crazy. The other AIs don't seem to care either. But when I do it after someone declares war on me? Apparently that makes me a monster.  I like the fact that small empires can work in Civ5 but it really seems like they're trying to shoehorn you into a path of founding 3-6 cities and you're done. Or you're going total domination."
civ,3ds8ne,wshields,13,Sun Jul 19 01:08:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is really annoying, but you can keep at least your cities following your religion with one inquisitor placed in a border city.

They needed to make capital cities unrazeable in order to make one of the arbitrary victory conditions work. Me, I liked to play Civ IV with all victory conditions turned off.

Not to mention the incredible indeptitude they show in actual conflicts. After a while all that just gets annoying, but you still have to deal with it unless you play MP.

There are other aspects of the game where I think this works quite well. Relative military strength that is. I've been in games where I simply know Japan would declare war on me if it wasn't for the fact that I had a bigger army. I mainly had that army by virtue of a huge income and 2-3 military CS allies that kept feeding me troops I kept upgrading. I did all this to prevent a war I had no interest in fighting.

civ,3ds8ne,wshields,3,Sun Jul 19 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a pretty simple oversight, but it also (as with most of the AI's problems) comes back to a lack of centralized, forward planning. I wonder if the Artificial Unintelligence mod addresses it."

civ,3ds8ne,Fuck_That_Guy765,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:36:59 2015 UTC,"A thought on Spain capturing India's capital:  the warmonger penalty is quite a bit lower in the early game, increasing as the game goes on.    It's fairly reasonable for a player or AI to knock over a capital in the Classical era without becoming public enemy number 1, as long as the victim has another city and will stay in the game.  I do it pretty frequently and then go on to peaceful victories.  In fact, if I want to play a religious game and start next to Boudicca, this is almost always what ends up happening to prevent her from spreading her religion before she can even really start."
civ,3ds8ne,Vironomics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:02:24 2015 UTC,"Check out Piety and Prestige by JFD it adds a few new mechanics that help with this.  Basically Piety is how devoted to your state religion you are. Each civ can either found or adopt a state religion. If you have a high Piety other religions will basically not be able to convert your cities. You gain Piety by buying missionaries, converting other civilizations or going into inquisition in all of your cities (you can also gain it by buying religious buildings if you have a tenet in the social policy tree). You lose 1 piety per turn at base rate. Each of your cities that isn't following your state religion causes you to lose an additional 1 piety per turn and ideologies make you lose 3 per turn. You can declare your nation secular starting in the Renaissance era.  Also your newly founded cities convert to your religion."
civ,3ds8ne,stanglemeir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"Ok so I finished this game now.  I ended up wiping out the Iroquois. They had 6-7 cities. But once you, as a human player, take someone's capital the AI is just going to be a pain in your side for the rest of the game so it's easier just to wipe them out.  Even after taking the capital I had 2 friendly states. I had people denouncing the Iroquois (I'm actually really starting to hate the whole denounce thing). I guess because they'd captured Carthage's capital. Carthage was neutral to friendly through this whole process.  When I got to Carthage I decided to liberate it, having never done so before, just to see what happens. I also returned a worker.  Well, Carthage stayed at Guarded (so much for a major liberation bonus; I guess it only cancels out one of the 6-7 major warmonger bonuses?) even though they had no hope of taking their city back (only one other city and inferior units). They wouldn't trade with me with the spare Spice they had (well, not without demanding 10 things in return) and 10-20 turns later they denounced me.  So this whole thing I thought was pretty ridiculous.  I stand as the largest empire with a large (largest in the world) modern army (Destroyers, Battleships, Infantry and Artillery) against their two cities. Between their cities they seem to have ~2 Caravels, 2 pikemen and a crossbowmen and the AI decides the right thing to do is piss me off? There aren't any neighbours that can protect Carthage.  I ended up declaring war since everybody hated me by this point anyway (two former friends having both denounced me by this point) and it took 3 turns to wipe out Carthage's two cities.  It just doesn't make any sense. If you have a powerful neighbour you should probably be doing what you can to protect yourself or find some equally powerful protector."

civ,3ds8ne,WumperD,4,Sun Jul 19 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"The AI likes to go Piety, which gives extra faith. The AI seems to prioritize beliefs that help them maximize faith purchasing; i.e. shitty monastaries, cheaper missionaries beliefs etc. The AI spends a lot on its faith aggreisivly, trying to convert other civs via missionaries and great prophets. So it seems they have more faith than they actually have, since they flaunt it in your face. An excellent opportunity to ""claim"" free great prophets for you to plant. The AI cheats. Halie Selassie is a dick and you should kill him ASAP."

In most of my games, I typically have at least half the civs converted to my religion. Then again I only play with like 6 civs max.   As soon as I get a second prophet i start converting cities. I use trade routes to influence my religion (I sometimes take that as precedence over gold or science) and try to get enough religious cities that the pressure is so high for other religions that its really difficult to keep it away.  You have to spread your religion to keep others away I guess."
civ,3dvklr,Matrayo,5,Sun Jul 19 22:01:09 2015 UTC,"I'm playing 43 civ true start location on YNAEMP pretty much exclusively these days, and if you do choose to do it i have a few suggestions that make it more fun for me, and might interest you:   Play on a lower difficulty than you're used to playing on, especially if picking a random civilization. One of the main ways to stop an AI getting close to victory is to wipe them off the face of the earth, and doing this when it's possible that your start location is not anywhere near them is more difficult. In addition, if you're going with a European civilization or a random one, you may end up completely surrounded, and if you're on a high difficulty you can get easily overwhelmed and be stuck with 1 city.  Consider changing some game options to better suit your needs. A lot of people say that disabling barbarians/victory types/whatever makes the game ""not legit"", but you have to keep in mind that you're playing a single player game and its up to you to decide how you want to play. I personally think disabling barbarians helps a ton for late game (although this is mainly because my computer is an old piece of crap and I find 5 minute barbarian turns unfun), as well as disabling science victory as it can be very difficult to stop a civ that's getting close to science victory when the map is this large. Consider using Mod Civilizations to keep things fresh. My first 43 civ games were a ton of fun, and after that I added some mod civs and manually added which civs I wanted in the game so there would be a better distribution. Europe is crowded. REALLY crowded. Removing some of them for some modded american and oceania based civs helps a ton for general balance.   Overall, just have fun with it. It's certainly a different experience than smaller games of civ, but it can be really fun if you love large epic games that can last a very long time."

Let's say each city increases your culture cost by 5% (example). So if you have five cities the cost will be at +25% in total. If you lose one of those, the cost will remain at +25%. If you go on to obtain a new city, the cost will remain at 25%, even though it's technically your sixth city.

I don't dominate much, but I've never had an issue choosing what to do with a conquered city or changing my mind later on within the confines of the game.  I too used IA in mod form first and then DLC form. The things is that the game knows which mods you used in a savegame and will only continue with them in place. So if you were in the middle of a game when you made the switch to DLC form (and you deleted the mod form), this would be where your problem is coming from. You instead need to either start a new game, or continue your existing one using IA in mod form ONLY.  If you are onto a new game and are just using EUI and IADLC, be sure to not only delete the IA in mod form, but also empty your ModdedSaves folder. The game's stability does depend in part on how many saves you have even when you're not using them."

Slide 8: For the rest of the game*  Slide 9: I wait a few turns for the mongols to commit their troops, then decide to invade as I was going to at some point anyway.  Slide 16: Economy first, then come back for the kill later since he no longer poses a threat.  I'm actually hoping someone else will take his city since I don't want that land.  Slide 20: They have the land I need to improve my economy.  Slide 22: I'm glad to get the free market civic, even without a great merchant.  Slide 25: Multiple continents*  Slide 26: Waste more trebuchets than I had hoped*  Slide 27: Thanks to Ragnar converting, Egypt isn't mad that I invaded him.  In fact, she's glad.  This also means she won't start spamming units, thankfully.  Slide 28: Area that I discovered earlier.  Slide 33: Forcing egypt to move their entire army to a single tile in the east.  Slide 40:  This puts some stress on my larger cities, but I move tiles around as best as I can and attempt to minimize the damage.  I hope that I can end the war before the next vote.  Slide 45:  I realize that I can switch back to hereditary rule to save my cities.  Unfortunately I also temporarily lose 1 hammer per turn on each town.  Slide 47: I discover that a tile must be made entirely of mummies and pyramids.  Slide 53: Took a long time to get to this point, so other civs are still ahead in tech.  Slide 55: I crap myself as i think I have been invaded.  It turns out I've just received a random event on the same turn that India invaded someone else.  Slide 56:  I breath a sigh of relief and go change my pants from the previous incident.  Slide 57:  I figure that I can still manufacture the parts faster than the Maya.  Slide 61:  It also means that the gap between our civs has closed up.  If he has all my tech, (and potentially more) he could still win.  Slide 63: I waited for full part redundancy to make sure that it doesn't fail in flight.  I figured I had enough time to do so.  Slide 64:  Ethiopia will get a nice view of the defeat screen if he can survive 2 more turns.  Alternatively if he doesn't, he'll also get a view of the defeat screen.  I suppose it doesn't make much of a difference to him.  Slide 66: I dream that one day my continent won't be one giant mountain range.  Slide 70:  Surely my citizens rejoice as they look at their futuristic digital alarm clocks.  I look down at my iphone to check the time.  This game is old.  Side 75: I ran gold/science in all my cities to see how many times I could get future tech before the game ended.  The answer was 3 times.  Slide 80:  Getting Caesar is basically impossible on noble.  Your score doesn't get multiplied enough.  I consider that it may be possible on Emperor if I won conquest on a smaller world.  If my world had been smaller (just my continent and maybe 1 other, I could've won conquest and gotten Caesar, but what's the point in that?  Go big or go home.  Slide 82:  Total game time was 10 hours, including time I walked away from my computer.  If I count time actually playing, it's around 7 hours.  Thanks for reading/viewing.  Hopefully you enjoyed.

civ,3dt2qa,arythm1a,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:34 2015 UTC,"I suppose I forgot to post the settings.  The map was tectonics, the size was huge, there were 15 civs, and the game speed was normal.  All victory conditions were enabled with the exception of time (obviously, who wants to win/lose by time?  Though there's no way an AI wasn't going to win well before then on Emperor).  I disabled tech trade and turned on random personalities.  I also disabled vassal states, and enabled city flipping after capture.  If you haven't used hat setting, it means that if you take a city, it'll probably get taken back with culture if you don't keep 10 units in it.  I'm thinking of doing something completely different if I make a post next weekend.  I'm considering an earth game with always war enabled.  That would be on noble of course.  I'm not sure if I could win that on anything higher than noble.  Alternatively, I'm thinking of playing an earth game on Deity."

Dunno how, but messed up diplomatically this game so I pissed off the other 6 AIs for invading Indonesia.  Indonesia invaded me 4 times.  I invade them once, capture my second city of the game- all 3 of allies denounce me, along with the other 3 civs.  few turns later, all 6 declare war.  Had 6 cities to start the war. My city I captured 50 turns earlier, was undefendable and lost in 2 turns.  Of my 5 remaining cities, only 1 was exposed.  3 of the 6 AI to declare war went after a city that had a 1 tile wide harbor that was 3 tiles long.  needless to say, they couldn't bombard that city nor make any progress with melee ships.  the only exposed city 2 adjacent ocean tiles, but 4 additional tiles to bombard from - cost me half my navy defending.  That city though had 3 great scientist improvements and adjacent to a mountain.....was not losing it."

Maybe it would have to be made so that the players at war would get more turns than players at peace, but those turns take place at smaller intervals. For example, every player at war could get 12 turns for every 1 normal turn, but their turns take place every in-game month instead of every in-game year. Stuff like tech and culture would have to be scaled, and unit production would likely have to be overhauled so that training new units didn't take forever, but it could work.  Not that I can mod or anything..."

If you keep your culture game low and go for Education and then Acoustics, you can potentially go straight from Tradition into Rationalism, which makes Secularism cost less.  You're right though.

Once Writing is discovered any civ has a %, this in turn is a % of all techs researched, so if you are 6th, and all civs got writing they you know you are 5 civilizations behind and 5 civilizations have more techs than you.  Thus, this info is available there.  It's just more visible now.  Hell, I would argue that EUI should just be patched in pernamently."
civ,3duiwf,TheMarshmallowBear,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that EUI should just be part of the game (maybe polished a bit more.. sometimes it's a little cluttered), but the level of info it provides should definitely be stock, and I'm really enjoying it!  But from what you're saying, it does still seem to give a little more info.  It states the EXACT number of techs discovered by each Civ, as opposed to the stock UI giving you exactly how far you are from the leader, and then a feel for where the other Civs are.  If you're the leader, you get some insight, but you'd have no way of knowing exactly how far the 2nd place Civ is -  EUI gives you that.  Bummer :("
civ,3duiwf,lebski88,3,Sun Jul 19 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the score screen tell you all this? If you look at the breakdown you'll have a score next to categories like cities, technology, wonders etc. You can then just divide this number by whatever the multiplier is. E.g. cities give 8 points for each city. I think technologies are 4 points each.  Not 100% sure this always works but this is how I figure some stuff out. I should install enhanced UI instead though."
civ,3duiwf,Spluxx,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hit F9 to bring up the demographics screen, and look at the Literacy rating. The number there represents the % of techs that you've researched.

civ,3duiwf,LMeire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. EUI definitely seems to give you more here... you know EXACTLY where you are and EXACTLY how far ahead you are if you're the leader.. I know it's not a huge advantage, by my sense of fairness is saying it's probably not cool to play with it in MP unless everyone is."
civ,3duiwf,Lemaign,3,Sun Jul 19 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"You can determine the exact numbers from the percentages if you know what the total number of techs are in the tree, which in multiplayer, nobody has any real excuse not to since the tech screens are identical.

civ,3duiwf,BlackRei,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:45 2015 UTC,You can always check the trade route screen to see how many more or less techs your neighbours have. Of course this only works for civs that are in your trade range.
civ,3duiwf,DushkuHS,2,Sun Jul 19 18:51:53 2015 UTC,I think EUI gives an advantage because it reduces the amount of time taken up clicking through menus for information. I don't really think it's cheating though.

civ,3dr81k,LibertarianSocialism,6,Sun Jul 19 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"Free social policies when you get more science. So you can focus pretty much wholly in science and still max out rationalism without much trouble.  Poland's UU and UB are nothing to write home about unless you luck out and get like a 5 horse start, but their UA alone makes them S tier."
civ,3dr81k,skysbringer,4,Sun Jul 19 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't really buy it. There's still no actual buff to growth or research for them. Aztecs can focus less on culture buildings as well and get a growth bonus for science."
civ,3dr81k,LibertarianSocialism,5,Sun Jul 19 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"Poland's is less conditional, and, more importantly, free. Poland can complete an entire social policy tree (since there are 6 eras after Ancient) without raising the cost of any additional social policies they want to get. It's incredibly potent in every single victory condition - Poland can max out Honor, Rationalism, Aesthetics, Patronage, or any of the other social policy trees, in addition to the usual social policies you get along the course of the game.   There's a reason Poland is ranked so highly in pretty much every BNW tier list out there. Their UU and UB give them a decently strong early-midgame military power (not Zulu or China strong, but strong enough to turtle easily), and their UA only gets stronger as the game progresses."
civ,3dr81k,skysbringer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"Poland's UU and UB are nothing to write home about   Bullshit. Two promotion Horsemen right off the bat are fucking amazing.  And Winged Hussars are my favorite UU, no doubt."

civ,3dr81k,themexics,6,Sat Jul 18 20:57:08 2015 UTC,Iroquois actually rarely gives the production boost to make it's UB as good as or better than the building it replaces. It's hard to gain enough population to work all those forest tiles because forest tiles aren't good for growth.

civ,3dr81k,deityblade,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"Both on paper and with experience, an Iroquois city would either have:   better production vs. a city with the same number of lumber mills, or better food vs. a city if you were to replace lumber mills as mines   Only true if the main source of production comes from lumber mills, however. If you have more of the other sources of production (e.g. 5 Petra hills + only 5 more lumber mills), then you'll definitely lose in production compared to other civs in the same situation."
civ,3dr81k,Bragior,5,Sat Jul 18 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"Normal workshop = +2 prod and +10% bonus to everything  Longhouse = +2 prod and +1 prod from each worked forest tile  What is the issue with this?  You are losing a flat 10% bonus to all production to just a flat +x production.The % bonus scales throughout the game.  You generally don't work forest tiles early and there aren't that many 'workable' forest tiles (not enough growth (namely)/prod). What is should probably read is ""+1 prod from forest deer"".  While it makes lumber mills better (and better earlier), if you don't improve wooded luxes, they get slightly better, at the cost of happiness (or tradeables). I mean you could build Lumber mills on wooded hills as opposed to mines to give you a 1:3 instead of a 0:3 (foodrod) tile - which could lock strategic resources.  You also generally want to chop forests to help with early buildings/unit rushes (eg libraries, settlers, wonders, etc).   Basically by the time you have lumber mills you can produce more food, but you have to deal with a very shitty early game or go down the production/military tech path first, neither of which are very desirable. You may end up in a situation where you are getting more production from your longhouse then you would have from the workshop, but by then you'll be way behind.   Comparatively, the Huns or Russia have much better production abilities. Even if they are situational, they are about settling and working tiles you would want to settle or work anyway. On grassland iron and horses can support the citizen that works them and have great production, while for the huns cattle are just sploosh."
civ,3dr81k,KuntaStillSingle,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's a common misconception that Iroquois cities require an entire forest to work on just to cover up the production loss brought about by the lack of the workshop bonus. In reality, you only need a few early in the game, and then just a few more later in the game. Hell, I think 10 forest tiles might be too much compensation for the lack of the additional 10%.  In the early game, everyone starts out without a workshop anyway, so a debate between a Longhouse vs. a Workshop during this time is moot. Food is very important and therefore, if you are surrounded by forest tiles, these tiles are subject to cutting down in favor of farms. The Iroquois is no exception.  Also, unless you're Wales, a Hunnic city will rarely outperform the Iroquois working on 8 forest tiles. It's even harder for Russia because strategic resources are far more scattered compared to bonus resources and plain forest tiles. They do get their production bonuses earlier, though, I'll give you that."
civ,3dr81k,Bragior,3,Sun Jul 19 04:04:10 2015 UTC,Iroquois honestly are one of my favorite civs. They're like the inca except for forests. Also the longhouse is great.

They do something which very few other civs can do, which is turn otherwise essentially unsettlable city spots viable and in some cases even into god tier cities. The almost free (if you plan them right) roads plus the ridiculous growth makes going wide easier too as you can still let every city grow and in all my Inca games I always have two or three huge cities that can work all tiles as well as specialists slots and can do crazy things like produce X-Coms in two turns or wonders in 5. Why? Cos Terrace Farms baby. Depending on how well you settle your cities, you can often have a bunch of 4 food 2 production, and sometimes as much as 6 or 7 food tiles which is just amazing.  My second fav has to be Shaka for all those crazy promotions and the Impi spam is just so much fun especially with the special promotions. It gets to the point where I don't even hate AI Shaka for being a huge warmongering dick because those times when I do play as Shaka, I play exactly as the Shaka AI does."

civ,3dr81k,Crazee123,10,Sat Jul 18 20:19:59 2015 UTC,"Can I just vouch for someone underestimated?  ALL HAIL HAROLD BLUETOOTH, KING OF MOVEMENT AND SEAS.  I apologize for the formatting. Mobile.  Anyway,  He is at his peak when you discover Astronomy. (the one that lets regular units embark...? Forgive me, I'm not great at remembering what is what. I play too many games)  You may be wary; let me show you how his glorious movement stacks up.  First, his straight bonuses: Viking Fury- Embarked units have +1 movement and 1 movement point to move from sea to land Melee units pay no movement point cost to pillage  Then pile on his special units:  The first you come across is the Berserker, a replacement for the longswordsman.  Amphibious promotion, so no big deal to attack over sea. (that is, no movement penalty for attacking over sea or river)   And then its second bonus, as you might expect, is just straight up +1 movement.  There's also the NWS- Norwegian Ski Infantry.  They have a 25% Combat Bonus in snow, tundra, and hills, as long as no forest or jungle, and Double Movement in those areas as well. Really specialized, but deadly in those areas.  Here's a scenario similar to what I've come across many times. It is crazy.  So let's say you've got the Great Lighthouse (+1 movement and sight), and you want to invade someone across the sea. Great! Let's say you've been lucky and have a bunch of iron early on, and you've got 5 berserkers as a sneak force to quickly do some damage before the enemy can react. You are 15 water tiles away, and they have a coastal city preparing for invading. All you are going to do is get in, pillage 15 tiles or so, and get out, as best you can.  Quickly deviating, let's pretend you're another civ. In the same spot, with longswordsman (perhaps not the best tool for the job, but I digress) and even with great lighthouse, it would take 5, maybe 6 turns (provided it's all ocean) to get all of them there. Then, with 2 movement for them, it would take another 6 or 7 turns (depending on tile placement) to get about 15 tiles pillaged. And on top of that, they will be getting attacked, and you'll likely lose one or two, since they're in harm's way for a total of 8 turns, as their movement pattern would be (if I understand this correctly) 1. land 2. Pillage (takes whole turn?) 3. Move 4 Pillage 5. Move 6. Pillage 7.  Move 2 8. Move>Sea, with all being within range of the city. Then another 5-6 turns to get back for a total of 18-20 turns. Maybe a few more if tiles are mainly behind the city. 25 absolute max.  Now you're Denmark. 15 tiles. Great Lighthouse. And we have +1 for embarked, and 1 to move to land instead of 2. AND we have +1 movement because berserkers. So that's a total of 5 movement per turn on the ocean, 3 on land, as opposed to 2 on land and 3 on water. So it'll take 3 turns to get there then when you move onto land. You can also pillage that turn, and then move again, since you have 3 movement, one for landing, one for pillaging, and one for moving. On top of that, if there were units on the coast, no problem because Amphibious. Just to clarify, each turn, you can move forward 1, AND pillage, AND THEN move one more. So land>pillage>move is one turn. Next turn gets it done (unless the tiles are weirdly acquired, then it might take more) because (3 movement, 1 to pillage) you pillage>move>pillage. So that's 3 to get there, 2 (3 for weird tile placement) to complete attacking. All the while, your units won't get attacked too much, as they are in range of the city for only 3 turns. Then it takes another 3 to get back for a total of 8. Again, more if tile placement is EXTREMELY vertical behind the city. Max would be about 13.  Final calculations (TLDR zone)  Best case scenarios:   Regular: 18 turns to complete, 8 of which units are in range of city  Denmark: 8 turns to complete, 3 (4 possible) of which units are in range of city.  Worst case scenarios (some extrapolation):  Regular: 25 turns, 11 in range if city  Denmark: 13 turns, 4 in range of city  So, as far as I'm concerned, Denmark is amazing right when you can embark and have berserkers. Such a beast.  Sorry if I miscalculated something. Feel free to critique me.  But yeah. All fucking hail Harold."
civ,3dr81k,stevedeka,2,Sun Jul 19 06:14:13 2015 UTC,"A few corrections:   Astronomy. (the one that lets regular units embark...? [...])   Optics allows embarkation, Astronomy allows embarkation over ocean and +1 movement when embarked.   Pillage (takes whole turn?)   It does not, it costs only 1 movement.   1 to move to land instead of 2   Disembarking with any other civ is all your movement   The biggest benefit IMO of Denmark is the fact that siege units can disembark, prepare, and fire all in one move, so the instant they land, they're taking the city down to low health, and with Astronomy, you can get as many as 6 in range and fire, and then hit it with a berserker from the sea to cap. One turn capture."

And you can't take the objective that turn unless you have blitz.  Tanks you can.  Tanks have a different type of capabilities as well--being able to pillage a substantial number of tiles a turn is an entirely valid type of warfare, and can be quite effective at destroying an enemy's long-term (or medium term) capabilities.

The only civ I've come close to that with was my 6-city tradition Babylon game where every single tile in my capital was an academy. And that one true start location Shoshone game where I had >50 cities, but I think I died irl upon seeing that amount of science, so I dodn't write it down.  Other civs have gpt problems? Pffft, just connect your cities with your quasi-free (entirely free with commerce) roads. What is a gold deficit?  Can't choose between growth or hammers? Why not both? I once had a completely bonkers Inca capital FOUR TURNING space ship parts.  Afraid your frail archer you use to scout with will get rekt by barbs? Nope, it just backpedaled through the entire Amazon jungle. (Actually happened once, bleeding hilarious.)  What are hills? Some arbitrary difference in terrain other civs have trouble traversing? In Incaland we run over them. With Kilimanjaro we fly over them. I once killed the entire world in a religious war. Using composite bows. On Emperor.

Because I know them very well I can get more immersed in the games by using real life Medieval Mongol strategies to to defeat my enemies. It is also nice that I know all the Khans so I can assign them to help guide my army if they were great Khans or I can just plop em down as Citadels if they sucked in real life.

I wish that you could use Landchnekts to launch covert missions in another civ's territory. Pillaging trade routes, kidnapping units, etc. But, since they're already mercenaries, they fly no flag and don't lead back to you. Give them a skull and crossbones icon, or the inverse color scheme of barbarians..."
civ,3ds02u,ridger5,3,Sun Jul 19 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I really hope future Civilization games use Beyond Earths' tiered Alien hostility. It would give the AI some serious bite if their Civs could become ""enraged"" over contested territory or something, and then freely pillage improvements/assault units.  It would gloss over the AI being somewhat bad at unit positioning, while also making Diplomacy pop-ups about denouncements and the like actually have some gameplay consequences."
civ,3ds02u,banktwon1,2,Sun Jul 19 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"For the reimbursements i was thinking that the civ would have to put down a reimbursement charge. If all of units come back then they get the reimbursement charge, if 1/2 come back they get half the charge.   Also being able to sell special units that could not be traced back to a civ would be really cool.  Being able to send units into an enemies territory and destroy stuff with no repercussions. Maybe add a policy tree for selling mercenaries, and able to recruit barbarians and send the to other civs and be untraceable."
civ,3ds02u,ApertureBrowserCore,7,Sun Jul 19 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"The investment topic is very good. I like your suggestions.  Forgiveness is, of all three of these, the most necessary. Your ideas outlined here are also very good.  As for civil wars, I like your ideas, but how could they be implemented into the game? By adding another autonomous faction, the game has to create another leader (and their personality traits). Who would lead a new ""minor"" Civ? Would they get a UA? Unique Units? Could they win the game, such as with a science victory? I suppose those are things Firaxis would have to worry about, but if it isn't feasible, in terms of programming, then it won't happen. I would like to say that those ideas are still very good, and hopefully a developer sees them."
civ,3ds02u,Monkalrus,2,Sun Jul 19 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Well for a civil war to start i imagine that their would have to be a ""trigger"" in sorts. Through foreign agent action  would attack a  city that was different in your empire, religion, being a puppet city, or cultural pressure. The same would go if your empire was extremely unhappy, then this would be the trigger.  To answer the ua question, i was thinking that they would get a ua for the reason why they broke out in civil war. Such as cultural pressure, all cities produce +2 culture. Nothing significant. And produce the UU of the major civ that they just broke away from. The minor civs would have the the diplomatic screen of a city state, but i do not know how personality would be decided. On the whole civ becoming major civs by being voted on, may not be such a good idea. I was just thinking that how countries today to be recognized as a country has to be recognized by  other countries."

civ,3dulxe,Boxrof,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"An atheist civilization would be very interesting indeed!  My take:  Start Bias: Grasslands‎  Unique Ability: Critical Thinking -   Earns logic instead of faith for all faith generations. Consequently, can't found a pantheon (and therefore religion, so no world religion) and buy enhancer belief buildings (e.g. cathedral, mosque).  Starts with a quasi-religion: atheism‎, which works as normal religion, provides 10% science bonus to a city if the majority of citizens are atheist. This bonus is gone if the majority citizens adopt a religion. The atheism pressure generation cannot be nullified but will cease if the city is conquered by another civilization. ‎ When religion spreads to atheist cities, founder beliefs work just fine (which doesn't benefit the atheists cities in question) but pantheon, enhancer, follower and reformation beliefs do not function.  Doesn't have access to Piety, but Rationalism is available one Era earlier. Consequently, doesn't have access to Grand Mosque of Djenne‎  Great Scientist points are earned 25% faster.‎  ‎‎ Unique Unit: Scientist - Replaces Inquisitor with 50% discount, requires logic instead of faith. A scientist can build a science lab, a tile improvement that generates 2 science, +1 with scientific theory, +1 with atomic theory and +4 with new deal, or do research which generates a small sum of science towards research (power is roughly 25% of a normal Great Scientist). The scientist is consumed either way.‎  Philosopher - Replaces Missionary with 50% discount, requires logic instead of faith. A philosopher can be used to spread atheism and erode religious presence in the target city (but doesn't remove them completely). If a friendly city (meaning founded, conquered and allied city-states) has philosopher within 1 tile range, missionary and great prophet spread religion strength are cut by 25%, doesn't stack.‎  ‎  ‎ The civilization may sound OP what with all the science bonuses, but hear me out:  1) You don't have access to pantheon or religion beliefs. This means no inherent access to sweet pantheons and beliefs like Desert Folklore to go with Petra, no Tithe, no God of Open Sky.‎  2) You don't have access to faith buildings like pagoda which can increase happiness, you also can't buy units with faith. Your early source of logic are shrine, temple and wonders.‎  3) Great Scientist generation is only half of Babylon, and Babylon has full access to religion which means access to Swords to Plowshares which can get their cities tall enough to take advantage of population bonus  4) No access to world religion. If you couldn't secure enough delegates, there will be a world religion, and they'll have tourism and delegate advantage  5) Philosopher only cuts by 25%, doesn't affect much, and with missionary discounts available to religious civilizations you'll be hard pressed to defend against religion with only philosophers  6) Scientist needs to compete with philosopher for the logic points, and with no real way to generate‎  7) The science bonus applies to enemy cities as well, so spreading atheism isn't such a good idea except you're up against Tithe.  ---------------------‎  There are, of course, some benefits:  1) You do start with a religion, atheism, this will help you research faster and get ahead of others to secure the wonders you need to build a bit of logic.‎  2) If you start out isolated, you'll be pretty much set for life.  3) Rationalism is available earlier, which means you'll be be ahead of everyone even faster  ‎‎  Expected gameplay:  With this civilization, you'll pretty much skip faith entirely and focus on science. The 10% bonus early on can help you beeline for techs that you need to improve your cities and not have to worry about getting the pantheon right.  Generating logic would be very hard although not impossible if you beeline and build shrine, temple and all faith wonders, which will cripple your science but should be covered by scientist's do research. The best way to obtain logic is to conquer whichever civilization has faith buildings like pagoda and mosque in their cities.  You'll have some problems against religious civilizations like Spain, because your science bonus will be negated, especially if they have great prophets around.  You need to play either turtling hard or conquer your continent to get rid of enemy religions to keep your science bonus. Use your technological advantage to counter your disadvantages. You should be able to use the 10% bonus early game and generate scientists late game‎"

Population = science, so you'll need to grow as much as possible. 4 cities is fine, but you really should think about trying to go 6-7 cities, depending on the amount of happiness you have. I usually build 3 cities, build NC in the capital, then expand another 3-4 cities. All your trade routes should go to internal food routes, especially to your capital. Exception being if you get a city-state quest. Some key attainable wonders you should aim for: Hubble Space Telescope, and that's really it. It's great if you can get the Oracle, Leaning Tower, Porcelain Tower and Eiffel Tower, but don't sweat it if you miss anything. Tradition > ??? > Rationalism is pretty much a must for social policies. The ??? depends on the game. I almost always open Patronage and Commerce, but it varies. Ideology-wise, Freedom for the specialist unhappiness tenet or Order for the factory science tenet are both good. You should finish Rationalism before going for Tier-3 ideologies. Don't forget research agreements. Try to manipulate the AI into constant war against each other. It's hard to out-tech peaceful AIs.

Unless this is an OCC or you're Rome, you can always assign another city to have a better production score and be your major city for production, culture, science or whatever. This is because, besides for having the palace and adopting certain policies, your capital doesn't really fare any better than any other city with equal or better placement.

Better settle elsewhere and have it as your to-go production city instead of your capital.  And besides, the capital is placed at the ""best"" location when creating the map not because of its raw yields but because of its access to resources. While it's common to find a best start here in this subreddit, it's also not unheard of getting a crappy tundra-with-no-forest island as your starting location.

I stumbled across Thebes which had so many wonders i could see them all on the main map. I saw the great pyramids and immediately declared war to take the city .........with my scout. Shockingly, they gunned him down and he failed to earn glory for the empire. About 20 turns later when I finished building my 1st archer, I sent him out to survey the enemy as they cowered behind their fancy ""walls"" and found a stack of elephant bombardiers so numerous the list went all the way up and beyond the screen when I hovered my mouse over it, all 4 tiles from my capital border. After overcoming insurmountable odds on the battlefield, they took my archer and hacked him down in the jungle and simply walked into my city. I couldn't believe I lost.

civ,3dmczp,oscar623,8,Fri Jul 17 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"This start is actually very good.  I'd personally move southeast and settle on the river there.  This would get me decent 2 food growth tiles.  hey not amazing but certainly not the worst, and there are most likely hills to the southeast in the fog and maybe even an oasis which would make it a killer spot.  Later on, farms and salt mines with petra would make your capital godly with 8, yes EIGHT, salt resources.  only 1 unique?  Well when that unique is the undisputed best unique luxury and you have ELEVEN copies between 2 cities on a large map, you're rolling in gold and you can get luxuries from other civs in trade.  Scout well and this spot becomes amazing.  I'd settle another city north probably directly on the salt next to the mountain and oasis or on the hill with the ruin depending on surrounding hidden terrain.  Those are great starts, and desert salts basically make for great plains farms without petra and absurdly OP tiles with petra.  Early game mediocre start, mid-late game powerhouse here."

civ,3dmczp,MeetYourCows,19,Sat Jul 18 17:27:46 2015 UTC,Is it correct to move the settler 1 grid down next to the ruins beside river and settle on that turn?  I could see arguments for even taking an extra turn or two to move settler next to mountains to the southwest or even the flood plains 2 grids from ruins closer to the hills to the east.
civ,3dmczp,DF44,16,Fri Jul 17 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one. I'd be tempted to settle next to the Oasis and mountain in order to get good early growth and some hills, but then you lose the flood plains.  I would be tempted not even to play this save. Flat desert salt is lame."
civ,3dmczp,pipkin42,9,Fri Jul 17 14:41:22 2015 UTC,"I can see merit in that too, but as Aztec, I think settling on river is very important, because missing out on floating gardens in your capital would be quite unfortunate."

When the first had three times as many techs as you, how many exactly did you have and how many did he have?  I could tell that the research cost would be increased for all civs because I know how it's computed and what the mods change. Also, once you made contact with a civ, you can always determine their exact number of researched technologies.

All your cities should have good science (science comes from population+science buildings, get them everywhere). Similarly, you want as much total production as you can get across all your cities. Gold is a bit different: you get the best returns by building gold buildings in cities that have high gold already, and this can be quite different between cities (check the economics overview screen). Gold isn't as high priority as the others though, as long as you stay positive (diplo victory can be an exception).  This thread has some info on culture specialists: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/3docp1/should_i_keep_all_my_guilds_in_one_city_or_spread/ TL;DR -- put your guilds in the same place, either the capital city or a high food city.  edit: and cities might tend to specialize a bit, but just let the map determine that. it's rare you can go in with a set plan, just make the best of your lands. if you have a city that's really unbalanced, like low production but great food, save gold to buy science buildings there, for example, or send a production trade route to help it out. i use trade routes a lot to rebalance lands. check the economics overview screen to see which cities are struggling on food/production."

I noticed that a lot of my games, if they got past turn 300, were extremely close as the AI usually starts getting to a point where their victory is impending and you only have a small number turns to win yourself, and oftentimes that's where I have to resort to military action. The AI sometimes won by a margin of <5 turns before I was able to take the last original capital.

This is because the AI's will be up in the informational era somewhere between turn 200-250 (on standard) so you can just use spies to stay with them, and focus one side of the tech progression map. Without winning, I can easily have everything researched by turn 300 on deity."
civ,3dpryh,Chileab,5,Sun Jul 19 10:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think that's because it seems like you're playing for a domination victory, which is the easiest way to win on deity I think (with the exception of a diplomacy victory as Venice). Try deciding on the type of victory you want to achieve before you start the game, I think the cultural victory is the hardest one as it's really difficult to get any of the cultural wonders before the Industrial era, especially if others are also going for it. Spend a minute or two analysing the tech tree, the units, the buildings and make a general plan after you scout the nearby area and you will get better at it with each game. You can always read a strategy guide but I think that planning your own strategy is more satisfying, regardless of the outcome."

Religious city states or ruins help too, but if you're aggressive with your early expanding and get shrines in all your cities it's not that hard to secure the right beliefs for a sacred sites cultural victory.

Pyramids, Petra, Colossus, Great Lighthouse, Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Notre Dame, Forbidden Palace, Big Ben, Great Firewall, CN Tower   Seriously though, Civ is a military game. Just look at how much of the game is centered around war. Domination is clearly the best victory, and the easiest once you get it rolling. Many players though (myself included when i started playing) doesn't have the natural talent for war that you seem to have. I don't have any problems winning domination most every time, but i often try culture and diplo victories for a fun challenge. Civilization isn't only about winning for me, otherwise i would only play domination."
civ,3dpryh,robotic-logic,3,Sat Jul 18 11:09:47 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback! The wonders comment was about how it's small relative to my Prince game, where I pretty much built every single wonder uncontested. I haven't played the difficulties Prince to Emperor since then, but from what I remember, it felt like the King difficulty is the most balanced in terms of competition over Wonders, as while you still have a chance at getting them, you have to actually plan ahead in order to secure one, in terms of teching towards it, knowing the other AIs and ensuring they won't beat you to it, as well as managing your city production/GPT trade/Diplomacy well so you aren't punished from building that specific wonder. Emperor difficulty you can rush a soecificspecific wonder if you really wanted it, but you will be crippled militarily and that often results in an early loss if a nearby warmongering neighbor suddenly wants your land.  I noticed on Deity that going for wonders is pretty much a waste of time unless for some reason none of the AIs have the prerequisites to build that specific one (e.g. land-limited wonders like Petra, or the policy-locked ones), which rather irritated me as it felt rather ridiculous that I'm being told Temple of Artemis has been built in a far away land when I haven't even finished researching Calendar.     I do very much like Civ 5's combat; the unfortunate thing is that a lot of game factors made it significantly harder (at least, from my limited and amateurish point of view) to go for the other victories. On lower difficulties, as soon as I managed to pass the AI in research, the entire world suddenly denounces me in 1 turn and formerly friendly AIs suddenly become Guarded and will no longer trade luxuries, GPT, or Research Agreements with me, and subsequently declare war and force your hand. On higher difficulties, usually one AI snowballs super hard and you need to specifically cockblock their majority on the World Congress in order to prevent them from fucking you over, so you either have to go for Diplo win yourself before they get it, or you go the much easier route and conquer them/ruin their economy so their CS alliances fall off.   I'm actually not entirely sure how I could get a cultural victory on Deity given the massive Wonder handicap and the fact that sometimes I won't even be able to found a religion if my start is bad, but I'm sure it's possible, and it's part of why I posted here - to have other players tell me what I'm doing wrong to have such a huge bias towards military victories.

Working the Writer's Guild is +6 culture per turn. Assuming Legalism and National College, that would be a 46% increase in culture gain.  Not working the Writer's Guild prematurely would allow for greater growth.  Bulbing a Writer means that 8 turns later, you'll have less culture overall. A fact that compounds with every turn after the 8. Also, you miss out on the tourism."

Eight turns of total culture can mean significantly more than 8 turns of a great work. Even if literally the only culture you're making is from a writer's guild and the Tradition opener in one city, that's 24+ turns worth, which you can get all at once once you want culture, like right when a civic you want becomes available. And while should be worth a little less by the time you get to the civic you want, it's not like you've spent that time doing much to build your culture."

Assuming Legalism, four cities, and National College, that's (3+4*2+1+1) 13 CPT. To bulb a Writer at this point would mean a gain of 104 CPT. Not counting multipliers like Hermitage, that's 52 turns of what a great work would provide. If you don't think the game is going to last 52 turns more, do what you like.  Your question to me was why I wouldn't work the Writer's Guild and just bulb them. I've answered your question (not that you've answered mine). It works against my stated goal and I find the 2 CPT to be more valuable, especially when you consider you also get the Tourism, theming bonuses, and multipliers.  To see this play out (and the SWEET science yields it offers), check out this video:  https://youtu.be/HvgyqhmoRCw  This thread is asking others who find value in this approach how much they do things like intentionally not take on all the happiness they can on right away to avoid a golden age before Renaissance where the culture buff could force one to adopt a filler policy.  If it's any consolation, I had restarted that map to try and push it off. I was unsuccessful. I, like you, don't mind. Opening Aesthetics allows me to make fuller use of all my guilds.

Even if I was playing Korea/Babylon and really wanted a tall science empire, which I don't usually prefer to play, I'd dabble in Patronage (for city-state friends) or Commerce (for a bit more cash, that will probably go into research agreements so I can get more science anyway) rather than possibly hamper my development for the sake of trying to get a moderate science buff a little earlier.

This including changing tiles early on the maximize research, growth, or when the city is about to be unhappy, maximizing hammers so that city doesn't grow, so that when you make a settler/worker next, you don't have the -2 from the angry citizen.  Another use is changing hammer tiles so that a city will grow and finish a unit on the same turn so you can switch to a worker/settler with maximum efficiency.  -Managing workers manually.  I manage most of my workers individually.  I don't set them to automatic, we the exception of maybe 1-2 to build roads/connect resources.  If you don't manage workers manually, they make a whole bunch of farms.  You want to choose improvements yourself so that you can put down cottages instead of farms.  In addition, if your wheat/rice/corn isn't irrigated, after civil service you can make a chain of farms to irrigate your food for an additional +1 per turn.  -Another thing to be particular about is city placement.  If you saw from the album I posted, I made sure to think about which cities would get which tiles, particularly food, as well as grassland.  I try to get as much grassland as possible into a single city, or limit grassland.  That way you don't have to waste hammers building a library/university/bank in each city if it's not one of the grassland cities.  That's something I was struggling with in the posted game.  There really wasn't enough grassland to run an economy on.  Grass is going to be your bread and butter if you're looking for research.  If you have lots of food, plains or grassy/hills can also be acceptable.  -Great person points.  Something that people don't often discuss is that GP points needed for a great person grow exponentially, and each time you get a great person, the value for the next one is shared by the whole empire.  This means that you'll want to get all your great person points in a single city, ideally.  Those are the things I can think of off the top of my head.  Also make sure to choose your tech path wisely.  Consider which techs will allow which things.  Some of the most important techs to reach for are monarchy (at least for me so that I can get hereditary rule.  I find making big cities to be the most efficient, especially by late game), writing, music/literature/civil service/code of laws (if you're playing on monarch or higher, or if you go with the merchant farm strategy that I tried to show, but failed.)  Hopefully this is helpful.  I'll try to highlight some of these things in another post at some point.  My next one will be another Emperor game though.  I'm currently working my way through at normal speed.  This one is going much better than the last, and I'll likely win."

civ,3drqbj,callmeishmael-,4,Sat Jul 18 20:38:08 2015 UTC,2 times bonus vs naval or land units and then you can get the range upgrade. Edit: I looked it up. You either need targeting II or 3 of the other promotions.
civ,3drqbj,Soluz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"2 times bonus vs naval or land units    Nope, 3 times."
civ,3drqbj,Eldis,4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"You need to get 3x of either bonus vs naval or bonus vs land unit promotions.  It is a much better idea to take logistics (2 attacks per turn) though.  At first it seems like range is the best way to keep your ships safe.  However, logistics allows you to attack twice THEN move, so you can guarantee you get to a safe spot.  A 3 range ship is still a sitting duck after attacking and can be surrounded by enemy ships if you're unlucky."
civ,3drqbj,nihongojoe,2,Sat Jul 18 22:44:18 2015 UTC,"Also, since you get experience each time a unit attacks, Logistics lets you get promotions twice as fast than if you went range first."
civ,3dogla,nihongojoe,15,Fri Jul 17 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"For those recon units keeping an eye on your borders, A also works pretty well. A puts units on alert, fortifying them so they don't demand your attention every turn, but activating once an enemy unit (including barbarians) appears within their line of sight. Granted, it won't help you detect an approaching army if the civ in question hasn't declared war yet, but I find it to be very useful in the early game, giving me easy advance warning of approaching barbarians without having to manually tell my units to stay idle every turn.  Especially since, AFAIK, this feature is new to Civ V, while spacebar as ""no orders this turn"" dates back to at least Civ II, and maybe I (Colonization had it, at least), though it took until Civ IV I think? for it not to actually consume the unit's actions that turn, so you can still move them later if you change your mind."
civ,3dogla,StrategiaSE,3,Sat Jul 18 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah A as ""alert"" is great too, but if you aren't at war it won't alert you, as you pointed out.  I don't mind hitting space bar every turn, it's a trade off because I am likely to forget that a unit is there on lookout duty and get surprise invaded.  Like I said, it's a great way to remind yourself to do things.  I also find it useful for healing scouts in the early game.  If you have a low HP scout or warrior, far from home, pressing H or clicking ""fortify until healed"" occasionally results in that unit healing for a few turns only to be killed by barbarians because you didn't check up on it.  It's negligence insurance, I only heal with space bar if I'm at any risk  whatsoever."
civ,3dogla,DushkuHS,8,Sat Jul 18 06:40:42 2015 UTC,"W cycles through units that have movement left and is accessible to your left hand.  I started making use of keyboard shortcuts space, B, F, A, W.

civ,3dogla,jkudria,2,Sat Jul 18 06:33:38 2015 UTC,"I have to thank you for this pro tip. There are times when I tell a unit to heal to full and then a barb walks up and starts chipping away without me knowing. Then other times I hit alert instead and I end up forgetting about the unit until 15 turns later. While tedious, this is a way to hedge against both of those. I didn't realize saying do nothing would make them defend and heal, so thanks for that."

civ,3dogla,RealMyBliss,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"The items on a unit's action menu will show the hotkey if you hover over the action; handy if you forget one. Annoyingly, the action key for ""build manufactury"" is ""M"", which is also ""Move mode""; so Great Engineers have a dud hotkey and just go into move mode.  Note also that the keypad numbers can be used to move units a single tile. I have started to do this instead of using the mouse unless there is another unit which I need to move through. It makes moving an army much faster than with the mouse. I simply keep pressing ""9"" on the keypad to move all my units north-east; though I also have to cycle through them so I can move the ones at the front first. But I'd have to do that if I was using the mouse anyway."

So build everything there. If that's not the case you are probably doing something else wrong...  I prefer to build all of the guilds in the capital for a number of reasons:  1) In general you want to have a capital that is as big as possible, to maximize Science, wonder production, gold from city connections, gold and happiness from the monarchy policy and so on. That means that your capital with its high population is well suited to work specialist slots.  2) Usually you'll build all of your national wonders and most of your world wonders in your capital. Since some of them increase great people generation, science and culture output and so on, you'll get the most out of your guilds when they are in your capital. On the other hand, your weaker expands usually have better things to do than working culture slots. Getting food and hammers for example.  3) There is a rationalism policy which gets you 2 science per specialist. Because of this you'll want to have your guilds in the same place as your national college.  4) Since your capital is your strongest city, it is easier to defend than the rest of your empire.  If your capital is not your strongest city, or just slightly better than your expands, focus more on growth and get more food trade routes to your capital going. You really want a big capital, especially when playing tall and tradition!"
civ,3docp1,Quappas,31,Fri Jul 17 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Using 6 specialist slots for culture and cultural Great People generation severely limits food in your capital, especially the writer's guild that comes out early when your capital has low population. Having the extra population for science, production, and gold gives your empire more versatility, especially early when higher population and production can snowball into a game-winning advantage later. I like to build my guilds in my highest food city that isn't my capital, along with the national epic.   This preference may be because I am usually very militaristic, so I really value the extra production in my capital."
civ,3docp1,jetlags,7,Fri Jul 17 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, this approach might be preferable if your capital doesn't grow fast enough, you got an expand with noticably higher growth tiles than your cap and/or you want to use your writer slots early. I guess it depends on the playstyle. I tend to build my guilds relatively late and focus highly on food and food trade routes to the capital. In addition I prefer culture slots over 0 food 3 hammer or worse tiles. Because of this my capital usually uses up all the good growth tiles around very quickly, resulting in a high amount of excess food. At that point I put the culture specialists to work.  Are you using food trade routes? If so, how many? And at what point in time do you build your writers guild?"
civ,3docp1,Quappas,4,Sat Jul 18 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"Classic example of when you wouldn't put the guilds all in the capital: playing as the Inca or Dutch, and you have a bunch of good terrace farm or polder tiles in your second city"

civ,3docp1,Eldis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"That is true, but 4+ food or production instead of 6 culture early is far more important than late game food, science, and happiness from that policy, since that early versatility will snowball.   Of course, this is just an argument against using those specialist slots that are available, but I'd rather work those slots in a secondary city so I get the best of both worlds early. The snowball effect is powerful, and late game improvements are effective for much less time, reducing their value.  Edit: There is definitely something to be said for food trade routes though. I could see an argument being made that guilds in your capital + food trade routes going there are better than guilds in a secondary city with 0 or 1 food trade routes directed to that city. The extra population in your capital, where NC will be built, will contribute more to science than extra population in a secondary city. However, I think the loss of versatility still outweighs the benefit, since you'll also be making less gold due to having fewer international routes."
civ,3docp1,jetlags,4,Sat Jul 18 16:34:40 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree with Quappas. You almost always want to ensure your capital is your best city. It's not always the case, but even in wide games your capital should take precedence over expansions.  The only exceptions for me is 1. Playing wide/liberty start or 2. Your capital is just outright shitty, for example not being on a river or having low production for wonders such as the national epic, etc. In that case, place your guilds where you'll get the highest GP generation."

civ,3docp1,Raestloz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"What I’m saying is that “having low production for wonders” isn’t a problem for your guild city.  High‐food, low‐production cities are actually good candidates for guilds."
civ,3docp1,BrowsOfSteel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Theoretically having the production for Sistine Chapel would be nice, or at least one Wonder so you get +33% culture from the Aesthetics policy, but AIs like that wonder so much that it is near impossible to get at high difficulty."
civ,3docp1,jetlags,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:33:36 2015 UTC,"Sistine Chapel is empire‐wide, too. You’re thinking of Alhambra.  Alhambra’s free Drill promotion is the more valuable part of it, though, so you really ought to put it in your highest‐production city.  You’ll then want to build any culture wonders in that same city, not in your guild city, so again, production doesn’t matter for a guild city."
civ,3docp1,BrowsOfSteel,2,Sat Jul 18 12:38:36 2015 UTC,"+1. One more point is that the capital is usually going to be the only city with both the pop to support specialists, and the hammers to actually get those guilds out in reasonable time."
civ,3docp1,yen223,6,Sat Jul 18 11:40:33 2015 UTC,"Some people build the guilds in the capital, while others prefer a secondary city to build them. This is because often than not, the capital needs to produce various other things which takes precedence over guilds. In any case, It should be preferred to build all of them at one city along with National Epic, because it provides +25% to GPP."
civ,3docp1,CoffeeCigaretteBeer,4,Fri Jul 17 23:05:51 2015 UTC,"Only reason to spread them out is if you are playing wide, and don't have the food to support 6+ specialists in a city. Even so, they should be built in garden cities to maximize great people generation."
civ,3docp1,JustAnotherPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:27:29 2015 UTC,I always put them in a second city as my capital got the science specialists first. Didn't think about the advantage of putting it in a garden city. Thanks for that.
civ,3docp1,cam-,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"When playing tall, keeping all of your guilds in your capital has numerous benefits. The most immediate being National College + Secularism. Also, things like National Epic and Hermitage have similar multiplying action.  I cover a lot of this, how to put it all together, and how to maneuver it for a solid science game in this video:  https://youtu.be/HvgyqhmoRCw  Among other things, it shows how not working the Writer's Guild the moment it's up can actually improve your science game."
civ,3docp1,DushkuHS,3,Sat Jul 18 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"Since everyone is arguing too build them in the same city ill give you a different view.  If you are not going for the cultural victory it can be beneficial to build the guilds in cities that are struggling with border expansion. BNW is limited in culture sources in the early game.  Also piggy backing on the other comments I rarely build them all in one city, unless I have stupid food there, six culture specialist out of your city hurts production and growth substantially. I don't know about you guys but I would much rather have engineer specialists than musicians in my capital if I have limited space."
civ,3docp1,sonastar,3,Sat Jul 18 03:46:10 2015 UTC,"My strategy is to pick a secondary city to focus on the guilds -- preferably one near a river/lake so I can get a garden bonus.  You do probably want them all in one city, though, just to get the National Epic bonus.  I tend to avoid building them in my capital just to keep my capital productive (specialists tend to drain on mid-game production)."
civ,3docp1,ArcticTern4theWorse,3,Sat Jul 18 04:36:35 2015 UTC,"If you are going tall (I'm absolutely shit at going wide so I won't touch on that) its best to find a city with a river and high population to build the guilds in, the city will be able to build gardens which help produce great people, also be sure to build your national epic in this city."

civ,3docp1,sameth1,2,Sat Jul 18 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to work it out and how fast your city can grow.  If you put all your guilds in one city, you'll need to make sure your city can support six specialists. If the city cannot gain more food than it can support, don't bother. The advantages of this is that it nets you tons of culture later on, thanks to the Hermitage (build it in the very same city). If you managed to snag other culture-increasing wonders, all the better. It's a massive boost to your culture. Another advantage is that you can have buildings and wonders that increase great people generation in only one city and it will affect all three guilds.  If you put your guilds in two or more cities, you'll be expanding your borders faster. Culture would be slightly less if you decide to put Hermitage to only one of them, but you will be claiming territory in a larger area. It's also easier to manage the specialists in case your cities have trouble growing."

I asked him to stop the first time, he said he would stop, he did it again, begged for forgiveness, and kept doing it. If it was vice versa I'm pretty sure he would've started a war with me by now and the whole world would've denounced me.  However, like I said before I want some peace before starting another war and this is the first time I've been friends with everybody on my continent (other than the late Songhai).

civ,3do0xy,natneo81,8,Fri Jul 17 20:55:14 2015 UTC,I actually have a very similar laptop and the answer is that it can run but you have to be realistic if you want consistent performance and reasonable load times. It's not the ideal way to play the game at all.  The graphics have to be set to low and the map size should either be tiny or small to keep the number of cities and units down.  That said i've still had fun playing the game on that smaller scale and if you already have that laptop i'd say getting the game is worth it. If you're trying to buy a machine specifically because you want to play civ i would say you need to up the price range or buy a desktop.
civ,3do0xy,Who_is_Atlas,4,Fri Jul 17 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"Absolute shit. Civ is a very CPU-heavy game, and a processor with that low of a clock speed just won't cut it.

It's not meant to have a historical feel. Civ:BE is meant to be more reminiscent of SMAC, and it's a spin-off just like SMAC, so it does not even need to have the same feel that Civ 5 does. At all. The only reason Firaxis made Civ:BE feel mechanically similar to Civ 5 is because the SMAC community is quite small, and they feared that Beyond Earth would not pick up speed without help from the Civ 5 community. That, of course, was a catastrophic failure.   The biggest issue Civ:BE has at the moment is that it's trying to juggle both the feel of SMAC and Civ 5. As BERT (That's our name for Rising Tide, the first DLC) is implementing at the moment - complex relationship screens and oceanic cities that are highly reminiscent of the colonise-everywhere request-anything style of SMAC, I hope to see it become better through the further isolation from Civ 5 style battles to a more Alpha Centauri feel.

I had herd many a nasty and mean thing about the game, and so wasn't sure what to expect, but soon found myself enthralled in a cool science fiction civilisation game reminiscent of many of the 4x space games.  Personally, 90% of the criticisms for the game tend to be very civ specific, as most 4x space games would have the same problems in their eyes, if not actually being a little worse. Not to mention the problem of being compared SMAC to the point where I never feel like I can play that game because of its massive circle jerk over it.  I highly recommend Civ:BE to any 4x space game player, as it combines the Civ 5 gameplay with the science fiction stuff of the future, hover-tanks, alien hordes, and villages ruined by trade.

I didn't really know about Civ:BE's existence but after watching some gameplay it seems pretty good/interesting concept. Literally half of it's steam reviews are negative though, so that's a bit discouraging."
civ,3dozhk,igncom1,2,Sat Jul 18 11:08:10 2015 UTC,"Its initial market was mainly Civ players, and we mainly play V. I bought BE pre-release, but played it only twice and not for very long either time.  The problem that I had is just as /u/igncom1 says: coming from V, BE is not as good a game. I love the historical aspect of V; it is part of the fun. BE was basically too much like V, but the changes took away to much fund and didn't add enough back. This makes V players dislike BE, I think.  If you have never played V, then BE will probably be a very enjoyable game. But personally, I would still recommend V over BE, simply because it is far more mature, far cheaper, has far more DLC and mods, and it has more rounded gameplay (from the more objective criticisms I have read of BE)."

civ,3dozhk,igncom1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"I don't get the complaint that BE is too similar to Civ V. Yes, it's clearly the same engine, but BE has some systems that are wildly different from any other Civ game, such as the tech web and affinities. The leap in gameplay from V to BE is greater that from III to IV, but nobody calls IV a Civ III clone.  My main problem with BE is that most of the victory conditions are too similar. The 3 affinity victories and the contact victory follow the same pattern; you research certain techs, you build a special wonder, then you wait ~30 turns and win. Plus, I find that victories happen about 100 turns earlier than in V, which just makes the game feel too short. I really hope they've reworked the victory conditions for the expansion."

Civ V threw all those out the window and did it's own thing.    Perhaps in CIV VI or VII the design will have matured enough (and AI improved enough) to make the new design work, but as it is it's nowhere near as good a strategy game as CIV IV."
civ,3dozhk,Dolgare,-2,Sat Jul 18 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Civ IV was a hodgepodge of great ideas with horrible implementation. So bad in so many ways, barely playable even with this two expansions. Just not worth it."
civ,3dozhk,killeryoshis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"I'd vote for Civ V as the ""best"" at least with expansions and a decent grouping of mods. The game is pretty well balanced, pretty easy to pick up but really hard to master.   Civ IV is definitely worth owning though. I personally didn't find the base game that exciting, but some of the mods were really cool and fun enough to overlook some of the issues I had with Civ IV.   There was a Star Trek mod I found awhile back that converted the map to the galaxy and gave you like 25 Civs to choose from(Federatrion, Klingon, Borg, etc.). It was really well done and a ton of fun to play. Cavemen2Cosmos is an amazing mod too and probably the most popular one."

civ,3dnq64,Zero5urvivers,16,Fri Jul 17 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"As the Aztecs I'd probably go Liberty>Honor>Commerce, but that's just me. Starting honor can be very viable to, especially as the Aztecs where that extra culture on barbarian kill compliments your leader bonus very well.   As for war, try to start something early and slam your jaguars with some ranged units in there. The Aztecs have one of the most powerful melee units of the early game, so take advantage of that. Try to take an early Capitol if possible, then go from there.   DONT BUILD WORKERS. As the Aztecs, any worker you see is yours. You're likely going to go domination so getting hated now or later really doesn't matter too much. Take workings, take patronage from city states, and plunder land. This can be a great source of gold to buy some early units.  If it seems like you spawned on a large continent, make 2 scouts first thing, before you do anything. Then if probably go either monument into military units, or just straight into the units as the culture from kills will be good compensation and then you can build monument later when you can also produce it in less time.   MAKE SURE WARS ARE WORTH IT. Don't start a war you can't win, and don't start a war where winning will mean half of your army being wiped out.   Being a hostile civ, other people won't like you. Trades will be ridiculous, and they will not give you good deals for the extra resources you have. You're going to need to be self sustainable. Get happiness bonuses for religion, and as many gold bonuses as you can. Happiness and gold will be your ticket to victory.   Also, see a civ with a huge treasury? Is he friendly? Good. Make a declaration of friendship, than make a trade. All of his/her gold, for all of your gold per turn and resources. Then declare war. You'll get your stuff back while he won't get his back. 30 turn deals can be canceled, while a sun of gold cannot be canceled.   Also, don't try to get any wonders. Ever. At least up until a bit before the industrial era. Reasoning? You won't get them. That is unless you get a godly production start. Even then it's unlikely.  One last thing, don't ignore science. It is absolutely necessary for you to stay at least with the ai. Never be behind by more than just a few techs of which none of contain a military unit. You need an up to date military to win.  Late game, do your best to get policies or anything that will reduce unit maintenance. This will likely be your main source of spent gold, so do your best to reduce it.   Big Ben>2nd policy on right hand side of commerce+autocracy unit cost bonuses will reduce unit cost by 77%. Yes. You can buy units for 77% less with these 3 things.  Have fun mate, and good luck."

civ,3dnq64,Zero5urvivers,8,Fri Jul 17 23:50:06 2015 UTC,"In one of my favorite Civ games ever (Huge Earth, Aztecs, Immortal) I founded my capital on the Panama Canal. I conquered 2 city states by turn 50, then after a bit of strengthening took Venice up by the great lakes (I think it had 70 pop by the time my computer died and I lost the save). I ended up building two more cities of my own, but they were more for the shits and giggles for 4 Food lake tiles and OCD filling in North America. Jaguars, especially in jungle, made it so I had more success in early war-mongering than when I play as Atilla. Spam Jags right from the beginning, capture workers, kill other units to keep them healthy, and bust down those low HP early cities. No need for settlers. I caught up earlier than all my other Immortal games too, oddly enough. Coquered Atilla in Alaska/Canada, and then was just happy to have played a good early game even though it looked like I was en route to The Netherlands winning a culture victory before me. Then I realized the value of preemptive strikes for the first time. Knocked out the Culture leaders core cities/wonder, boosted my own culture, then went on a crusade to turn the world a muddy orange.   My computer died after I had taken all of South America and Africa. I founded punny, shitty snow cities ('Snowzil', 'Madrift', 'Attilla's Igloo') boxed in by my borders and ice up in the Canadian Arctic, so that they could all fight little silly wars with each other over the barren snowscapes after I gave them the cities as consolation prizes. I guess those were the only other cities I founded.. It was just a matter of the hours I put into the rest of the game at this point. Some of my original Jaguars were still alive and upgraded and wrecking face in Polynesian Asia Minor. The only nation I was going to leave alive was Morocco, who was eliminated in the BCs. I was eventually going to give him all my islands as a steward, and for not being a dick to me for warmongering all game.   Disclaimer: I was hated (-20 resting) with all other city states for the rest of the game. But that doesn't matter, when you are going to war with their allies and have to pacify them anyways.  Proclaimer: Even at the end of my play, I was getting new policies every 5-7 turns. Massacring GDRs as the Aztec is worth more than any monument you will ever build."
civ,3dnq64,Finch619,3,Sat Jul 18 07:34:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends if you'll be able to conquer anyone or not. Do your best to get at least 4 cities before turn 100 if you're on standard, that way you build stuff in those cities throughout the game. Excluding your Capitol and maybe 2 or 3 more cities, you should stagnate your captured cities at pop 9-10 so you don't get too much unhappiness. Just because your production is low in cities doesn't mean you'll be getting units slowly. This is because you'll have  somewhere around 10-15 cities to produce stuff with late game."

civ,3dnq64,SignOfTheHorns,5,Fri Jul 17 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"Depends the civs you're playing against really, but I'd have to say wide. Wide not as in 10 cities in one continent, but 10 cities an in at least one on every continent, everywhere. This can help finish local quests for city states like making a trade route mid game when you lack the range to make a trade half way across the world. This also allows for trading with more city states, which can hugely help the highly underrated 3rd tenant in freedom that increases your influence by 6 every turn when you have a trade route with a city state. It's either 6 or 8, but I'm pretty sure it's 6. Freedom is usually my choice, otherwise go autocracy if you have an army to compliment your empire."
civ,3dnq64,I_Hate_Idiots_,2,Fri Jul 17 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"The great thing about diplomatic victory is that it works well with most any play style. However, I would say that wider is very good for diplo victory, because the more cities you have the more gold production you have. Both of those ideologies would work well from diplomatic, depending on your play style. If you plan to do some warmongering, and/or end with the largest army, gun boat diplomacy from autocracy is very, very good. Another added benefit of warmongering, you can just wipe out big competitors. Otherwise, choose freedom. You definitely want to get forbidden palace, it will make you life quite a bit easier in the early world congress, passing the votes you need. Forbidden Palace also has the benefit of helping with warmongering, reducing the amount of unhappiness from cities, which stacks well with the autocracy path, if you well choose. Apart from that, not to many key wonders for diplomatic victory.  TL;DR - Wide is a good choice, autocracy or freedom, definitely get forbidden palace."

If it's archipelago or islands, a great admiral might be s very good idea, providing you are the first to printing press. However, the science you would get from an early academy might also help with getting printing press first. If you are playing archipelago, I believe you can find all civilisations with crossing oceans, meaning building a small fleet of triremes would find the other players for you, rendering your admiral obsolete for exploration.  For your Liberty policies, I would get the one on the top left first, ( production I think) then get the one on the top right ( gives a free worker). After that, it really depends on how your game is going. If you need a quick settler, the settler policy is good."

A 2 pop city is only 5 unhappines, and it is now popping 8+ hammers. wide play is less reliant on border growth, plop those cities adjacent-to or on them resources. Less citizens to work tiles is less city-tiles needed. religious pressure is on a per city basis. Go distance over power for enhancer belief if unsure.

civ,3dnq64,EmperorLuxord,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the hardest jump in difficulty IMO, at least for me anyway. The AI become much more ruthless on Deity. And knowing the game inside and out is pretty important. What I mean by that is knowing what certain leaders are easy to get a friendship with, what leaders are loyal, what leaders are scummy, and what leaders tend to snowball.  Nothing is more important though then the early game. Getting up your cities, making sure they are well defended, making sure you have decent growth and production. Which nearly all the time hinges on your city placement. Don't be afraid to take one or two turns to find a good city location.   I'll give you a few tips for helping in the early game.   steal a worker from a citystate because it will save 7-12 turns (Standard) Build a shrine for faith output and for a pantheon Don't neglect culture or tourism because you'll be hit with a disgustingly big happiness penalty from ideology pressure if you're tourism isn't good enough Meet other civilizations. They will start with 4 additional techs (Pottery, Animal Husbandry, Mining, The Wheel) which means if you meet them you will have a shorter time researching them If you have a weak neighbor, declare war on them, and take their capital, but do not completely wipe them out. You will suffer a tremendous diplomatic penalty, and it will be hard to make friends And you need friends for research agreements, which is probably the second most important thing when playing on Deity. If you're going to do well on Deity, you'll need help from the AI. However do not make friends with leaders who aren't loyal (Alexander) or are very deceptive (Enrico, though it's not as important versus loyalty).  And probably the most important thing to note is that you need to bribe civs to go to war. I cannot stress how important this is. This will prevent civs from starting research agreements with each other and will hurt their economy if the war doesn't go anywhere. Even if they are no where near you, don't hesitate to bribe someone to declare on them or for them to launch an invasion on someone else.   If you can beat Immortal in less than 350 turns, you'll be able to play on Deity. Good luck!"

Battering Rams and Siege Towers start with Cover I. Kris Swordsman can generate unique promotions which are unattainable elsewhere.  However, I would say that the best way to start with super promotions would be to play as Assyria as the Royal Library can grant exp to units if it has a Great Work of Writing, and the Siege Tower gives you the very useful Cover I that remains on upgrade. Build your units in a city with a filled Royal Library (if Assyria), Barracks, an Armory, a Military Academy, the Honor Policy Discipline, the Autocracy Tenant Total War, your Heroic Epic, and the Wonders Brandenburg Gate and Alhambra if you can build them.

Here are some generic advice:   Get Patronage for the science per city-state allies policy (allying is pretty easy if you're rolling in cash), then go down Rationalism. Venice can actually get policies pretty quick since puppets do not increase the cost of social policies. Commerce is nice for the extra gold, but IMO Rationalism is just too good if you have problem with science. Have you maxed out all of your trade routes? Trade is Venice's lifeblood since they get double trade routes, and you can get a bit of science with them too. Also, a lot of gold = a lot of science agreements, provided you're friendly with everyone, which you should, since trade and research agreements are very useful. Puppeting too much city-states is also bad. I usually just puppet 2 or 3 of the closes city-states, preferably those with military units, and very early in the game.

civ,3dngzi,daaygo,19,Fri Jul 17 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"When simply asking about balance, I'd go with 6-8 players, Standard size, Ancient era, Raging Barbarians to make Honor viable, all victories enabled (even though Cultural Victory is literally impossible in multiplayer, as long as people pay attention), ruins on, difficulty immortal. Concerning speed, standard might again be the most balanced, but I usually go with quick speed because it enables some really cool offensive streat building for the player that builds the Pyramids. For map type, I'd say either Fractal, or you ask someone that won't participate in the game to create a balanced map for you. Fractal has the benefit that it's usually pretty balanced and is likely to produce strategically interesting situations, like canal cities to name an example. Continents Plus is another pretty good map, but it tends to make England the dominant force of the game. Pangea on the other hands tends to make naval civs like Polynesia too weak. Terra faces similar problems like Continent maps but less so. You probably also want Strategic Balance if you don't let someone create the map for you.  A topic that you probably haven't though about so far are mods. It is possible to use mods in multiplayer by using DLC-mods. If you want to use mods, just tell me which ones and I can create a DLC for you.  If you decide to go with mods, I'd advice not alter the game too much since you want it balanced. I'll just leave a few suggestions with explanations, and it's your decision whether you wanna play with mods and if yes, with wich ones.   3UC and 4UC. These two mods give each civilization an additional Unique Component, so that each civ has its ability as well as 4 Uniques. This one is very well balanced and even tackles a few balance issues, like the slightly buggy Iroquois ability or Venice's defensive problems. Using the EUI (see below this list) is highly adviced, so that this mod can be properly displayed. Events and Decisions. This mod adds a decision system: During the game, each player can decide to trigger one of multiple possible decisions that have advantages as well as disadvantages. Beware that decisions can't be deactivated once they're triggered. Also adds an events system that synergizes well with the decisions. Much like the UC mods, this mod also helps better balancing the game, since two decisions are unique to each civ. Cultural Capitals. This mod adds a King-of-the-Hill element: As soon as the first player has built two world wonders, an 'election' is regularily done. The election is based on each civ's cultural output. This mod is surprisingly balanced. Reform and Rule. This mod changes the social policies and balances the different trees much better. It also grants more interesting bonuses. Slower Research (30). This mods increases research times by 30%. Imo it increases balance, especially on quick speed. Era Settlers. Have you noticed that your cities start with free population and buildings when you start the game on later eras? This mod will grant these same bonuses according to your current era instead of the starting era. Usually, settling in the late game creates some very poor cities, since they are super underdeveloped. This mod helps with that while not making cities to strong, which imo improves balance, and it synergizes well with Terra. Scouts Ignore Borders. This one is preferential, not really altering balance. It allows scouts (and pathfinders) to cross borders even without open borders. Cities of Marble. Another purely preferential one.This mod adds a number of national wonders. Synergizes well with Slower Research.   One DLC that I'd highly advice you to use even if you don't wanna use mods is the EUI, a vastly improved game interface that doesn't alter any gameplay and doesn't provide additional information. It makes informations better viable, though."
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,3,Fri Jul 17 19:01:48 2015 UTC,Is there anyway you could make a DLC mod for a game of ice and fire?  I doubt it is possible but my friends and I have been wanting to play
civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,3,Fri Jul 17 20:06:18 2015 UTC,Sure! Here you go :) You'll find instructions for installing DLC-mods in the link to EUI I posted in the original answer.  Am I right that this mod only changes civilization and locks the later tech tree?
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"You are so awesome!  I have no idea.  I did with EUI but I have since forgotten.  Sidenote, is there a DLC version of every mod you listed in the OP somewhere handy?  I am planning to play all of them tonight with my friends. Also does everyone need the mod?"
civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"I just reuploaded the zip because the original version was incompatible with EUI.  I haven't succeeded in combining different custom DLC-mods, apart from EUI. My solution so far is to have different DLC-mods that each contain a maximal sum of mods i might use together. I then store these as ZIPs instead of actual fodlers so they don't all activate. When I wanna use mods, I take a zip that contains all these mods, unzip it, and delete the mods I don't wanna use from the unzipped version. A tedious process, but it's the best I found so far.  A zip containing the mods I listed above (and more, but I just explained how to remove those you don't like) can be found here. It doesn't contain A mod of Ice and Fire, though.  Oh, and yeah, everyone needs to have the same copy of the DLC-mod(s) installed in order to use it in multiplayer. EUI is an exception since it doesn't change any gameplay and is only visual."
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:53 2015 UTC,Ok so i can just unzip that can delete stuff i dont want and then do as I did with EUI right? Thank again for the help
civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes.  I usually save the entire zip in the DLC folder. When I wanna use some mods, I simply unzip it. Then I delete the mods I don't wanna use from the unzipped folder. If I don't wanna use the mods anymore, I just delete the entire folder. That way, I always have the complete version as a zip in the folder and I'm flexible in what I wanna use."

civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"Well, if the mods change the same files without using SQL to modify them, then they're usually incompatible in the sense that one overwrites the other. When at most one mod uses XML to modify such a file, it might still work, though.  DLL-mods are always incompatible with each other."
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:31 2015 UTC,What are the generic civ and gameoptions things in the mod folder

Then I go into that folder and from there go the mods folder then delete the ones I dont want.  Also what are these overrides and the pkg file.  Final questions I promise!"
civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't feel bad to ask :D  I'll assume that you saved the ZIP file in the DLC folder. When you go into the ZIP file, you'll encounter a single folder at first. This is the folder that you wanna drag into the DLC folder in order to use the DLC. In that folder, you'll find the three folders Mods, Override and UI, as well as a CIV5PKG file and possibly a DLL file.  You wanna leave the DLL and CIV5PKG files unchanged. Same with the Override and the UI folder. In the Mods folder, you'll find all the mods that belong to the DLC. If you want to remove a mod from the collection, you delete it's folder there.  By the way, you can't simply add additional mods by adding their mod-folder into the Mods folder. You will need a new DLC that contains that additional mod in order to use it."
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:21 2015 UTC,Last thing I promise.  Is the UI EUI?
civ,3dngzi,Luckydog8816,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:48:03 2015 UTC,"Wait, why would you have time victory turned on? It doesn't really add anything to the game."
civ,3dngzi,jonhydude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"Well, when exactly do you reach the turnlimit in multiplayer? It probably makes no difference whether you turn it on or off, and saying 'all victory types enabled' is just shorter ;)"
civ,3dngzi,Blackheart595,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"In single player it adds quite a bit - it adds a time pressure element to victory which is an important component in learning how to play on higher difficulties. If you're not used to the idea of ""if I haven't won by turn x, I've already lost"" by the time you hit the higher levels, you're going to have a harder time than normal. Disabling it is great if you want to just sandbox, of course, but a lot of people play with difficulty progression in mind.  In multiplayer ... eh, it's probably makes no difference either way. So disabling it feels pretty pointless, since it'll never really come into play anyway.  (Edit: reworded and expanded a bit.)"

Below is not their rules exactly but some good guidelines to follow.  Map: Pangaea no one should be isolated and able to stay safe from others. Alternatively Terra starts everyone closer to each other for more action and allows there to be a competition for Settling the New World.  Game Speed: Whatever is agreed upon, but bear in mind even a Quick game is going to take a long time.  Difficulty: Immortal is commonly used but this isn't a big deal if no AI are present.  Victory Conditions: All on with maybe Time disabled.  Resources: Set to Strategic Balance.  Advanced Options: play with all unchecked except Quick movement and quick combat (otherwise it will take forever).  Civs Random. If someone gets Venice then they can request a reroll (unless everyone agrees that people can play a civ of their choice).  You may also want to agree with each other that Nukes would be outlawed but that is your choice."
civ,3dngzi,Yurya,2,Fri Jul 17 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"The big problem with Pangea is that it makes naval civs like Carthage, England or Polynesia not great. Venice also takes a bad hit because of the possible lack of coastal city states."

The rest is great.  the Republican Army though will need to be about half the cost, while only maybe 10% weaker.  One interesting UA (for a campaign, not regular):  your cities that are puppets by an enemy generate double culture and faith for you.  Here is how I would balance it personally:    UA:  When at war with a larger civilization, 25% bonus culture and faith generation.  UU:  50% cheaper and 20% less effective then the Great war, but +1 movement speed and can be bought with faith.  UB:  Pub:  replaces Colloseum  +2 Culture, +2 Happiness.

Heres some ideas I've had for awhile -   EDIT: Old comments on them:  https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/17xvsi/what_civs_would_you_like_to_see_in_game_civ_5/c89vjbs?context=3  https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1jk8yu/redditors_of_rciv_who_do_you_think_would/cbfv94e?context=3  v1. Modern  Leader: Michael Collins  UA: Saints and Scholars: Missionaries and Great Writers are generated 30% - 50% faster (depending on balance testing). Saints and Scholars is a moniker for Ireland for a long time now. This relates to the amount of missionaries and nobel laureates/Writers we have produced as a nation.  UU: Flying Column: Replaces Great War Infantry. Can retreat after attacking. (Much like your own design OP). Flying Columns were squadrons that employed guerrilla tactics against British soldiers during the war of independence. These IRA recruits would target high profile personal or small units, ambush them and retreat as quickly as possible. Michael Collins himself was responsible for issuing these tactics in the IRA. They were extremely effective.  UB Option 1: Celtic Cross. Replaces Shrine. Gives 2 Culture + 2 Faith (like the Ethiopian Stele). This symbol is often linked to the romantic notion of Celtic Ireland. Its a unique Celtic take on the Christian cross that can be found throughout many graveyards and churches in Ireland.   UB Option 2: Pub. I was wondering what to replace this with and you're idea of granary actually sounds good OP. This version would give + 1 Culture and + 1 Happiness though.  UB Option 3: Keeping the Celeidh Hall - and renaming it Ceílí Hall like it should be :)  v2. Medieval  Leader: Brian Bóru  UA: Brehon Law: Courthouses built in half the time. Pastures grant +1 Food. The Brehon Law was the law used by the Irish before British occupiers enforced the Common law. It was used during the time of Brian Boru and other medieval periods.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Irish_law  As for Pastures granting + 1 food, Brian Bóru is known for his cattle tributes. His name literally means Brian of the Cattle tribute.  UU Option 1: Kern: Replaces Pikemen. Kerns were light Infantry, often mercenaries, employed by the Gaelic Lords.  No movement cost through forest, can pillage without cost. Extra gold from capturing cities and Barb camps.  UU OPtion 2: Gallowglas : Kerns heavy Infantry counterpart. Havnt decided on a bonus yet.  MOre can be found on them here.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kern_%28soldier%29  They are interesting military units in Irish history and should definitely be considered as civ units.  UB Option 1: Dún (types of walls in civ4) or perhaps a Round Tower, which is kinda unique to Ireland (replaces walls, city ranged combat gets +1 range.)  As for the other UBs, refer to v1. PM me if you want to know anything else!"

But for those crazy games, it's The Master Race civ. With Gabe Newell as the leader, their UB is the Gaming Shrine, which puts +20 of every thing on each tile you own, and their UU is the Ascended which replaces the XCOM Squad and does 2x as much damage.

I can say you only get the +6 culture bonus if the tile is being worked, so it does have to be within the 3 tile radius. Otherwise you're wasting your GAs.   It's been a while since I've played without BNW installed, but if memory serves correctly, you need to complete 5 policy trees then build the Utopia project. So you want to prioritize culture buildings, then probably production buildings to get wonders (especially ones that boost culture output, give free policies, or reduce the culture cost of policies). If you want to convert farms into monuments, then you should also invest in food buildings next so you can keep a high enough population to work the monuments and other tiles to keep your economy up.   If you can't feasibly make another monument, then use your artists for golden ages, since those increase your production, culture, food, and wealth per turn while they last."

I wouldn't use up Grassland tiles for Monuments as those can be used for 4 Food Farms which will be needed to work you Cultural Monuments.  Try and find space within the three tile radius for your Great Artists but if you have no other option the Golden Age will increase Culture among other things and it won't be a waste.

Different civs and eras  Uffizi - Three Art.  Bonus for same era and same civ  Do you see how five of the slots need same era and civ?  You're guaranteed a renaissance and industrial work from the wonder itself.  This is the easiest way to get the theming bonus.  Get a medieval work in your palace from guilds.  Get two renaissance works for Sistine (uffizi and one other)  Get three industrial works for uffizi (louvre and two others)  Fill the louvre with the medieval art you got earlier, two digs (ideally an ancient and a classical city state), and raid or trade for a rennisance art from another civ.  The Parthenon doesn't help the louvre because your classical slot is taken up by a dig.  Museums are easily filled by digs  The Hermitage needs 3 art from different civs and eras.

Basically its all about having good base tiles. No Marble needed.   Pottery > Writing > Mining  Scout > Monument > Granary > GL  Use your Warrior or Scout to steal a Worker from a City-State.   Tradition > Aristocracy can work, especially if you get a early Culture bonus from a Ruin. But personally, unless I get a culture bonus from an early Ruin, I just go straight into Liberty and max that out.  That being said though, I kind of cheat with France, Spain, and Netherlands. If I don't get a good spawn, I will restart a few times until I have a satisfactory spawn point. I find these Civs very dependent on good starts for success at Immortal diff or above."

With respect to the original topic, even with a good start and a civ that would appreciate Great Library, I rarely bother to attempt it on Immortal or Deity."

civ,3dicfp,MonsterBakery,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm against auto explore is because you're often then not aware of what you've explored and if it's good/bad, priority/not, etc."

Turn a farm into a trading post. It's nothing terrible in lower difficulties but on higher ones where every choice matters it might cost you a bit of time.

If you don't have a citizen on that oasis, then it won't provide you with that bonus.  So it is always good to get your population to grow, because you can work more tiles."

I think the key is that you're the major power in the region and pretty huge regardless so whenever I totally fucked up a war with the Mamluks and had to mercenary spam you're not ruined. Even losing a war will generally only cost you a couple border provinces and not put a dent in your powerbase.

So when I hear that Civ forces strategy decisions based on ""what victory type you're going for"", it turns me off. I'm in a game right now where if I want to win, I have to declare war on Persia.  I don't want to because in the world the game has created, I have no reason to.   Part of this goes to casus belli and in the game, ""you are about to win"" should not be a valid cause to declare war.   I would prefer that what are now victory conditions which end the game, simply become ""achievements"" which contribute to a vastly improved scoring algorithm. You built a spaceship? Great, but this other guy finished his 3 turns later so how special are you really?

It's a lot of fun playing co-op, because you can focus on your Civ's strengths while your friends can focus on theirs, and when together, your individual strengths cancel out each others' weaknesses. But since everyone knows that only one Civ can win, they'll never be completely dependant on another Civ for something (protection, trade, votes, etc).

Of course, if you want to be challenged you need to put all the AI civs on teams as well (which is what I usually do) but that can get really silly since a massive map basically just has 5-6 teams on it and placement can brutally affect which teams have a chance and which don't.

You scout a perfect spot for Petra and are in the process of building a settler, but your AI ally settles 2-3 tiles for 1 copper and just leaves the city there). One small fix would be an option to spawn civs in a team in a cluster on the map (makes sense, since historically, most civs looked to their geographical neighbours for help in the early eras). Additional mechanics like sharing tech, some kinda co-op wonder building would be cool bonuses."

There's not necessarily an end unless you have achieved a stable and overwhelming dominance over the world, but you can conditionate the game in order to make it really harsh to have a sustainable dominance, so others can catch up and force you to continue tuning up your policies and regain control. Also, you need to make effective military dominance too expensive to forbid actual dominance over all other civilizations, and rather force calculated and focused interventions (like the US, who has a lot of influence but not actually owns all the world)"

I took a long break from the game after finding myself stuck between Emperor and Immortal levels.  I could win at Immortal if I played in a very rigid way that exploited every little quirk in the game and wasn't a lot of fun.  At Emperor I was not really challenged.  I already had some ""house rules"" including not paying the AIs to attack each other, not stealing workers from city states and not saving Great Scientists.  However the one that I've now added to make the game fun again at Emperor level is that I'm not allowed to beeline techs.    The current version is that I can't start a column in the tech chart until I've got all techs from two columns back.  And I'm only allowed one tech from a column before I've completed the entirety of the previous column.   I may tighten the rules further in my next game.    In my current game, I've also set myself the task of winning a domination victory with 16 starting civs on a huge map and all victory conditions active.  So I need to get it done before anyone else wins another way.  It's going to be close.  I've still ended up with a big tech lead but working my way across this big map is taking time.

The Shoshone achievement is my last too - never played a game without mods since...).   And there's my point - mods. There's so many new civilizations I haven't tried out yet, that I rarely play beyond the industrial era. It's too fun for me to start over, explore a new world, meet new leaders and just build the empire from the ground up. While I enjoy the competition between the civilizations, I much more prefer to watch the rise and fall of empires, the conduct of wars and spread of religions and such. I'm also an audiovisually sensitive person - I enjoy watching leaderscreens, inspecting units on the map, pondering on civ symbols or losing myself in the soundtrack more than competing with programming. I also like to quit when I feel I've accomplished something in Civ - and it can be anything. Maybe I've spread my religion on half of the globe? Maybe I've build a thriving renaissance kingdom, getting cultural great people like crazy in a never-ending golden age? Maybe I've won a centuries-long war and even though I didn't conquer anything, I've survived an onslaught? To me, it's all about the story each of my games tries to tell.   Witnessing and feeling this pseudo-historical adventure is something much more valuable to me than getting a cookie for beating the code and numbers dressed in pretty visuals."

civ,3dicfp,ThatRussnGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:10 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree that is the way I love to play.  I've been playing with friends online and they are very domination focused or at the least they are militarily aggressive.    I on the other hand like to establish a strong civilization with good defense and strong stats to handle anything.  In a  recent game I won a diplomatic victory and all I heard from them after the game was how they could have took me out of the game earlier but they didn't and if they had how I wouldn't have won and blah blah blah.   The next game we played one of them attacked me really early on when I had little military as Morocco and they had a ton of military as Assyria.  Sore losers is what I think.

I'm more interested in how to play out games when I get a really crappy start as part of a personal challenge. Basically, I'm playing to learn.  My most brutal one, for example, is me as Portugal, starting in an island covered in mostly tundra and snow. Worse is the fact that I'm in true isolation (no city-states to cover my ass and I'm unable to get out of the island without researching Astronomy), and resources are completely scarce or are situated at even more difficult terrain.

And hopefully win.  In multiplayer, with my friends...I'm the wildcard. I generally play to screw with them all. Again, because I have little idea what I'm dong.

I usually focus on one other civ that I make a constant ally so that I never quite achieve total domination. I guess I'm still a casual player (still under 200 hours), and I've managed to win the game every way except through diplomacy, so I'm not always trying to rush domination or science victory.

civ,3dlpw3,Indon_Dasani,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"Generally, exploit. I tend to gravitate towards playing tall, focusing on building up my cities to their maximum potential, picking city sites based on how good the city can be with maximum borders more than just the initial location, trying to grab appropriate wonders, improving the landscape to its maximum potential, etcetera. This has been changing lately, and I'm making a conscious effort to play wider, when possible/appropriate, but even then I still keep postponing building settlers and putting off expansion until I have this one building, and that wonder, and maybe another Worker. I really like seeing my cities working to their maximum potential.  I would also like to value Exterminate more highly (not as highly as Explore though), but since the AI is terrible at warfare and I'm not yet good enough to put up much of a fight in multiplayer, it's just not as satisfying as it could be.

You don't see nations significantly cutting ties with Japan over its whaling program or China and its desire for ivory. Additionally, India possesses nuclear weapons in defiance of the non proliferation treaty yet it isn't a pariah.  The UN today is flawed because it is difficult if not impossible to hold major powers (US, Russia, China) accountable.

civ,3dnf6n,Luckydog8816,7,Fri Jul 17 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"Liberty isn't good for science in the long run.  8 cities pushing out 70-100 science per turn and a 150 science capital each will tech much slower than 3 cities pushing out 150-200 science per turn, plus a 300 science capital.  However it's quite good science-wise in the earlier parts of the game before science buildings and specialists come in to play.  Tradition is pretty solid, but it's weakest point is the lack of production bonus.  If you're a three city tradition empire trying to defend yourself from a ten city liberty one, you're going to have a hard time of it, unless you've completely blown past them tech wise.  That is unless all the AI go their standard piety-with-no-religion plus aesthetics policy mix, then you basically do whatever and pack your bags for space.  Babylon overcomes this by the great scientist at the beginning, which gives you a huge head start tech wise, and the 50% great scientist bonus ensures that you will generate scientists pretty quickly even in small cities without gardens or other great person boosts."
civ,3dnf6n,notwastingmyuber4u,6,Fri Jul 17 20:48:47 2015 UTC,"IF you can manage happiness.   More cities > every single yield, particularly science.   A 4 city amazing tradition empire will probably yield around 800  - 1000  at end game.   A 8 city, equally amazing liberty empire is more looking at  1000  - 1600.  A liberty empire will always have more specialist slots to more and thus more great people, which is particularly strong on Babylon with the 50% increase in GPP.  More cities = more everything, except often wonders.   *** Just something I wanted to note since I missed that you said you had the Fountain of Youth.

That doesn't mean that Liberty is not viable for Babylon, though, even when not combined with Tradition, since your science bonus helps you set off a disadvantage of going wide (even though the science penalty isn't that big). In your special case, you even have the Fountain of Youth, so you don't even need to worry about happiness. In general, though, more cities will easily offset their drawbacks as long as you can manage the Unhappiness and the gold cost for infrastructure.  I'm not a big fan of building the Great Library with Babylon. Sure, it has a research effect and it prevents other civs from building it, but first you might loose the race and second, you'll not gain as much from the free technology. With that I mean that you already naturally burn through the early techs, so you'll save less turns from it than other civs. I'd say build infrastructure till pop 3, then go for settlers."

You won't be able to on higher difficulties. It's early, when you should be focusing on establishing your borders and infrastructure. If you can't win without it, then building it won't up your game. It's just a really bad habit IMO."

However there is some kind of exploit/bug (? for lack of a better name) where I believe Indian cities can have local happiness > population. And if you got a liberty empire's cities to a certain threshold where you end up with a net happiness vs. a normal empire you are in a better position.
civ,3dnf6n,DushkuHS,3,Fri Jul 17 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Above 6 pop, Indian cities produce less unhappiness. This makes them better at wide play than most other civs. They're just slower to start."
civ,3dnf6n,yen223,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"At risk of stating the obvious, it is the slow start that makes India a very poor Liberty civ.  The big advantage Liberty has over Tradition is that there's a brief window early on when the flat bonuses from low-pop liberty cities is stronger than the percentage bonuses from low-pop tradition cities.   If Liberty players fail to capitalize on this advantage in time, they'll allow tradition cities to hit high pops and eventually out-tech and out-produce liberty cities.  For optimal liberty play, Liberty players have to use Collective Rule to crank out cities fast and early, something like 6-8 cities when tradition players have 3-4 cities. Any less, and they'll be forced to go tall, but with none of the growth bonuses that Tradition offers. Any slower, and the flat bonuses will start to be irrelevant.  Problem is, India can't do that without hitting happiness issues early. -6 unhappiness/city means every newly-settled city has to find 2 unique luxuries just to stay at 0."

Send raiders to the farther parts of the Ottoman empire while you are at peace to make some raids when you goto war again. It will distract his troops, and make for a really good story whether they are successful or not. Differentiate between cavalry, artillery and infantry on your tactical maps.

civ,3diggv,Macgki,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"Ah man that is hard to answer. Basically it is pretty much the same as a science game but you really have to press towards cultural wonders (e.g Uffizi, Sistine Chapel, Globe Theatre).   You also have to understand their themeing bonuses and try and 'pop' Great works in the needed eras.   Tech path is pretty much the same   Ancient and Classical:   Libraries / Luxuries National College Techs for Wonders Writing Guild once you have the population   Medieval Era   Civil Service Education  Theology / Guilds   Renaissance   Open through Acoustics or Astronomy Beeline Printing Press   Industrial Era   Scientific Theory Open ideologies through Electricity + Oxfording Radio or Industrialisation and Factories RUSH archaeologists! They are so important for themeing bonuses and great works.    Modern Era   Make the choice between going for Refridgeration and Hotels or rushing Plastics and Research labs Rush to Internet with Great Scientists! End game by buying as many Great Musicians. Sell one your cities off to the cultural leaders and pop the Musicians to win the game! DO NOT miscalculate the bonus and sell your cities off for nothing.    I have not tried going for the Hubble Telescope before Internet as I often need Internets' 100% bonus to combine with winning the International Games' 100% Bonus.   Here is a link to the save file of the turn that I won the game. Feel free to check out my cities, policy set up, religion etc.   https://www.dropbox.com/s/rl6l0cf4dcb627r/SPAIN%20GRT%20PLNS%20CV%20219.Civ5Save?dl=0  I'll be honest the cultural victory is the absolute hardest (bar domination). If an AI runs away with culture you may never win. In that case you need to war them or pay a neighbour to do it. This is also the same if someone is running away with your wonders."
civ,3diggv,Rud3l,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"Great, that's really useful. I think my major problem is the tech paths in the Renaissance / Industrial period. I never knew whether or not to go Education / Guilds first, so I could either stack a bunch of great artists for the industrial era for Hermitage / Uffizi or get the universities first. Also the balance between the acoustics / architecture track or Printing Press since the Leaning Tower and Sistine Chapel both seem pretty vital, but I'm guessing you prefer Printing Press for the ideology?  Also regarding wonders - Do you need both the Chapel and Uffizi? Between those two and Hermitage, that's 8 great works of art required to get the full theme and that's never really going to be possible - which would be least prioritized?"
civ,3diggv,arvendragon,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:33 2015 UTC,"Science buildings > Cultural buildings > Food > Production > Gold.   Pretty much always.   Acoustics opens the Renaissance and thus Rationalism and Secularism the fastest. I almost always take it.   Printing press is great to start World Congress and the two amazing wonders with it.    Chapel has two slots that are easy to fill. I very rarely get to fill the Uffizi, but I would still be building it JUST to get the free Great Artist.    I pop all Great Artists except when near the World's Fair as a golden age massively increases the cultural output (I also save 2 writers to pop 8 turns into it as well). However you should be getting a tonne of Great Artists (generally around 8 throughout the game). You also need 2 for the Louvre which is AMAZING, a 32  bonus when you fill out Aesthetics is huge!!!"

They also change how the ai works, so it's better at combat (naval and land). This was the biggest change for me, I wasn't used to the Ai not sucking at on the high seas.

I ended up waging a global war against the Iroquois who were slowly kicking my ass on Prince (normally play King). The happiness mechanic took me the longest to get used, since it's mostly city based (not as focused on empire wide).  The notes on the civfanatics forums indicate that the buildings/wonders/national wonders are in the in-game civilopedia, and I'm fairly sure all the new units are as well.

civ,3dj472,daedas,7,Thu Jul 16 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"Fair point. But the title wasn't asking if there were many. It was asking if there were any.  Also, while I totally concede I don't have any data to substantiate this, I would argue that part of why there are fewer female gamers is because of stigmas of the past and/or traditional gender roles. However, video games have been part of households for long enough that gamers have children now and more females are likely given the opportunity/exposure at a young age like never before. Add to that technology that makes smartphones and tablets so much more commonplace.  If nothing else, think of how many times over the years on the internet when youngin's were all like ""GURL!"" any time they encountered somebody they thought was a female. As if such things make a difference on the internet. By this I simply mean that females are incentivized to not be as forthcoming with their gender. So even if you had access to self-reporting data, I'd wager it wasn't entirely accurate."

Though I WILL go to war if my neighbour is an ass, has land I really really want, or is Brazil.  I'm so paranoid about Brazil winning a culture victory, that I kill him on sight.  I usually go for science victory on Emperor, and cultural victory on King. I've never won a military victory because I can't balance science and military production. T___T"
civ,3dj472,Stellastatistic,4,Sat Jul 18 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"If you are heading for science anyway, then you should have high population cities by the time that Artillery becomes available. Artillery is a game changer, with its 3-range ability. On King (I only just moved up to Emperor), you can spew out (say) 5-6 artillery units quite quickly, especialy if you switch your cities to be production-focused or use internal trade routes.  Your ground troops don't have to be very strong, but do need to be able to survive a turn of bombardment before taking a city. Unless they are mobile, like cavalry. You can move those in close, hit the city with artillery, then move the horseman back out to safety. When the city hits 0 health, the ground units can capture it, even if they are severely wounded. So you can move them in the turn before, then capture the city even if they barely withstood the bombardment.  So you don't need that many units for dom: you just need units with a higher tech level, which your science should have given you by that time.  Other pivotal units are Frigates, if you have coastal cities. 4-5 of those babies can reduce a city quickly, and they can be promoted to get 3 range and 2 shots per turn. Some Privateers to take the cities when their defences are gone and again, you don't need huge fleets (but will need ground troops to go inland).  Even earlier in the game, composite bowmen rule. 4-5 of those babies take down most early cities. In a recent game I had a horrid corner of the map and another city settled 3 cities nearby, taking the best land. He had to go, so I built some comp bows as quick as I could. 3 of them took all his cities along with a couple of pikemen to give the killer blow.  Late game, XCom units can romp through prety much all capitals on the planet in a surprisingly small number of turns, if you are ahead enough in tech that your opponents don't have strong enough units to cause them significant damage. They travel from friendly territory to a city you have visibility on with a spy, then they take it the next turn if you have enough land nearby.  The main thing to remember is that when you declare war, the AI will simply throw its units at you, blindly. So even if you are outnumbered, pick your terrain (hills for defense for example), put your troops where you can concentrate your fire and are en route between them and you, then DoW and wait for the lambs to arrive for their slaughter. As soon as the AI offers peace, you know their army is wrecked. Time to go in.  Hope this helps :)"
civ,3dj472,fatpinkchicken,4,Fri Jul 17 02:27:04 2015 UTC,Dude. This is really informative and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to write this out. I'll give it another go on King (or Prince...).  Do you have a recommendation for a good warmonger civ?
civ,3dj472,giantdeathrobots,3,Fri Jul 17 13:52:57 2015 UTC,"My pleasure; I love this sub because people took the time to type stuff out for me (and others, which I read and learned from), so it's nice to be able to give back. Any problems, and make a post here; people will help you out; even if your post doesn't get many upvotes, the odds are that you'll still get good answers.  My favourite civ used to be Japan, for Bushido (injured units fight at full strength) but really, that turned out to be not much of an advantage when I got better at tactics and balancing the number of troops I needed (which you get from experience). It's science which is the key. The Unique units of a civ don't tend to be be great, and do tend to be very limited in time (for example, battering rams are awesome in the very early game but then they are obsolete and give no edge at all).  The exception is England. 3-range longbowmen mean you can hit an enemy when they can't hit you. Safe city bombardment even before artillery. I do not warmonger against England, ever, in the early game, because they will rip me apart (even against an AI you need a very big army to take down Elizabeth before you have 3-range units yourself). Then they get Ships of the Line, which are really overpowerful for naval combat.  Science and happiness are the major concerns of a warmonger, because conquering cities generates massive unhappiness. If you are starting out, I guess I would say go with Poland, because those extra policies they get can really help manage happiness, especially when you get Ideologies.  The key thing about domoination is to pump out units quickly at first (I usually get invaded because I have barely any military, as I have been focussing on science or culture buildings). In that scenarion, I pump out units from everywhere I can; and I am still pumping them out when the AI offers to surrender. Then.. well.. I have all these troops... and they have no army... soooo.  Raze cities which arent going to be useful, and puppet everything else unless you have a good reason not to (eg you need a port to build ships in, or a strategic city to build or buy reinforcement units near the front). You can also raze cities down to population 1, then put them on ""avoid growth"". If they have happiness buildings, they can actually contribute happiness overal, after the initial hit.  Conqeuring a city with Wonders which generate happiness can actually give you a massive boost, so if you run into trouble, use spies to hunt around for a suitable capital to be a target.  So: rather than pick a civ, consider the map. England on archepelego is going to be a clean sweep when you get Ships of the Line, for example. If you play Continents, you will have to do a naval invasion at some point, and those are tricky when you are making landings against a civ with a large landmass. Pangea is easier for land-based domination victories.  But overall, my starter advice would be to pick a point when you have good tech, build more units than you think you will need, then go and romp and play. The satisfaction of seeing the cities fall will get addictive. You'll win some battles, lose some, but you'll start to get a feel for wether or not that play style is good for you.  Promotions are important, too. Always pick rough terrain or normal terrain when promoting a unit (land OR naval promotions for sea-bourne vessels). Never mix them unless it's an emergency and you just cannot survive without doing so. Because when you max out one of those, you get the juicy promotions, such as +1 range, 2 attacks per turn etc. That second one doubles the effectiveness of your ranged units and gives them twice the XP per turn. 4 units now give you 8 attacks per turn, with maxed out effectivenes on certain terrain. That is when you sart to really have fun, and the conquests speed up dramatically. Go get the honour policy which gives x2 XP per combat too, when you get a chance (before you warmonger but after the ones you'd normally get at that stage of the game - again, Poland is really good for getting to that stage).  Having your units promoted can be really important. Some experienced warmongers will keep a barb camp somewhere in a corner, just so that new units cn park nearby and pick up two promotions in the early game. Later, a nearby City State can be kept at war just so that newly-built units can go level up in peparation for an attack on a nearby civ. Declaring war repeatedly will get you a penalty, so just one declaration to open the training ground, and just keep them violently oppressed for as long as you need.  My advice probably missed a lot out and reflects my own style. There are some great guides out there which can give you much more details, and probably some civs which I have overlooked which are good ones to pick for a dom victory. I haven't even touched on tactics on the ground (how to position your troops etc). But in the beginning, use overwhelming force (with your great tech) and you'll start to demand learning tactics when you get a few surprising hits. I think if I go into anything else now, it'll just be overload."

And then I have half a continent so it's only tidy to make it all one colour. And then I get battleships, and that other continent only has frigates. And it'll be quicker than a Science victory now, and it's getting late and I should go to bed soon.  Have a look at my post elsewhere in this thread for details of my strategy. Generally by the modern era, I am far enough ahead (on King) to get artillery before anyone has good countermeasures, so a pause in science to build units followed by resuming science to get bombers and rocket artillery for when my artillery becomes vulnerable to air attack late in the domination.

If you built a mine over the iron, you'll get the iron. But, since it is outside the city's workable radius (3 tiles), you can't work the tile for the tile yields; you need a citizen to work the tile to get the yields. If there is no citizen available to work your trading post, or farm, or whatever else, then you are not getting any yields from it. If you want the city to keep growing, then you should assign your citizens to work food tiles, so your population can grow faster and higher. Other methods to provide food are building buildings that provide food (if you haven't already), and befriending/allying maritime city-states. Since you are doing a one city challenge, domestic food trade routes are not an option for you then.  So in essence, you need citizens to work tiles to get the yields from them, like food, production, faith, gold etc. This is why in the early game it takes so long to build stuff, because you have a low population that can only work a limited number of tiles."

If the terrain is blocking the longer range shots, then Gatlings are strictly better, and at least Cannons if not already Trebuchets are so much more effective in conquering cities.

Anyways, in my current game Indonesia declares war on me a half dozen times.  Finally I get together enough troops to take 2 cities and their capitol.  What happens after I take the first city?  Denouncement from all AIs in game.  While I am working on the second city, every AI declares war on me (6th out of 8 in military, Indonesia by this point is 8th).  Lose all my gains from my war with the Irish.  Keep my heartland only because the city they try and attack has a bay 3 tiles long and 1 tile wide.  Not the highest difficulty, but it is Emperor so the AIs do have substantial fleets that are a threat through attrition when my fleet is engaged elsewhere.  Everytime you make the AI your bitch, they will do something to piss you off like forward settle."

civ,3didvl,lax_br0,28,Fri Jul 17 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"There is already a built-in mechanic for this in the game, though it is perhaps not super-sophisticated. An AI with which you are friendly will pay 25 gold up front for 1 GPT over 30 turns. That pretty accurately captures the concept that money has more value in the present than in the future (which is what drives interest in lending, along with risk, of course).  Incidentally, a tactic that many players use is to trade as much GPT for lump sum on the last turn of a Declaration of Friendship, then denounce and declare war once the DoF expires. Perhaps a bit cheezy for some tastes, but Deity is hard, yo."
civ,3didvl,pipkin42,15,Thu Jul 16 16:49:04 2015 UTC,"Well Civ's concept of ""difficulty"" is basically allowing the AI to cheese you, nothing wrong with trying to level the playing field."
civ,3didvl,Foundation_Afro,5,Thu Jul 16 18:16:21 2015 UTC,On this particular tactic I agree. I'm less sure about the Liberty pillage/repair exploit.

civ,3didvl,OneBodyBlade,11,Thu Jul 16 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"A tenet in liberty makes your workers work faster. If you add in the Pyramids (a wonder that is often gettable on Deity, since the AI doesn't seem to care for it that much), they can repair a pillaged improvement in one turn. The game will allow you to repair pillages in enemy territory (it probably shouldn't, but it does). This means you can bring workers along with you when you attack an enemy. Since pillaging an improvement causes your unit to heal, you can have your unit pillage, then have your worker repair the tile, then have the unit pillage again, thus soaking up a lot of the damage the defenders can deal out. Next turn you can repair and pillage once again.  I understand that this tactic is banned in competitive multiplayer like the No Quitters Steam group, and most Deity players also frown upon it. I've used it in the past, though I've stopped recently. It's just too cheezy."
civ,3didvl,pipkin42,4,Thu Jul 16 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, nice, hadn't considered that. I think with something like that, if you wana bring 2 or 3 with your whole army to help with some more important units, that would be OK. Having one move with every unit would be a bit much, but I think managing a few super squishy units to act as medics in the middle of a war is a neat tactic."
civ,3didvl,OneBodyBlade,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Why cheesy? You can do this in real life too. Perfectly legit strategic planning, requires you to befriend someone, them to have money and you to declare war for it."
civ,3didvl,ForKnee,2,Fri Jul 17 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I do this one when I can. But I know some people consider making trades that would not be advantageous to you normally just to cancel them cheezy."

War has always been a tedious point in the Civ franchise for me (I'm not a fan of micromanaging war units).  The length of games due to war contributes to my unwillingness to use all my free time to finish a game. It loses the fun at that point. While I do enjoy challenges from games, the increased challenge level to time ratio in Civ is just too great; I'd rather be challenged in other games where I don't need to spend a full weekend in order to complete a single map."
civ,3dinz7,Sp00nyBard,3,Thu Jul 16 19:34:34 2015 UTC,"I dig it. It wasn't long ago that I ONLY enjoyed the early game. Establishing borders, fending off barbs, getting enough workers for my cities to be viable. For me, that's what the game was about.  If you don't like the war aspect, there's ways of not engaging in too much or any at all. Here I made a video about how to goad your enemy into declaring war on you to gut his army and then his lands/coffers. If you watch the whole thing (14 mins), you'll see my empire wasn't slowed down in the slightest:  https://youtu.be/rgG4BoUqkGo  Here's another one. It's longer, but it shows ways of having such a blowout science game that I was able to pick a 2nd tier Freedom tenet before I would've needed military at all. It kind of shows how you can play peacefully and still have enough military to dissuade the AIs from attacking you:  https://youtu.be/HvgyqhmoRCw"

You will face good people and bad people, people who does a lot of war and people who turtles. You actually has a chance of getting early wonders, but you gotta watch out for enemy armies. You can't fight 4 ranged versus 15 units like you can against the AI. All in all its just much more balanced and fun for me."

Remember, particularly if you count the tiles right (works best on open terrain) it is often possible to move in, slam into an archer, and move out again. If you have some roads built purely for war purposes this works even better"

Civ5 units are very poorly balanced, missile units are just so much more powerful than anything else until you get artillery - offensively and defensively.

So let's say your tourism is 2 per turn, you have met civ A for 10 turns, and civ B for 5 turns. Your accumulated tourism to civ A will be 20, and to civ B will be 10.  These values are compared to the other civs' total accumulated culture to determine your influence level (so for example, if civ A has accumulated 2000 culture, then your influence level over them is 20/2000 = 1%). In order to win a cultural victory, your influence on all other (surviving) civs must be 100% or more, therefore overtaking the world with your superior culture.  Of course, beware that you are not the only one outputting tourism! Other civs will be showing off their tourism as well, and you'll need to counter by producing a lot of culture yourself. Increasing influence levels does more than just keeping track of your victory progress, they also provide benefits to the influencing civs, such as increased science per trade routes, less resistance when conquering cities, increased effectiveness of spies. The most major effect, however, is generating ideology unhappiness if the two civs have differing ideologies and one civ have better influence level over the other than vice versa; the influenced civ will be hit with LOTS of unhappiness, possibly forcing them to switch ideology if the unhappiness gets out of hand.  TL;DR how to generate tourism?   The most straightforward way is to consume Great Writer/Artist/Musician to create great works; each great works add 2 tourism. Building the 3 guilds that create them is an absolute must. However, if you're aiming for a cultural victory, then it's better to use the Great Musician's concert ability, which provides a major one-time boost to tourism to all civs, instead of creating a great work of music. Swapping great works to fulfil theming bonuses. Each buildings/Wonders have different theming bonuses; hover over the number to see the requirement. Expect a lot of swapping. Once you research Archaelogy, you can train archaeologist to dig up Antiquity Sites and either create an artifact (which functions similarly to a great work of art), or create a landmark improvement. Note that landmarks themselves do not generate tourism, but the culture yield can be converted to tourism by building Hotels/Airports/National Visitor Center. The latter case usually creates more tourism than an artifact, so try building landmarks if your cities can work the tile. You can also individually amplify the tourism other civs receive by many ways: signing an open border treaty, sending a trade route to their cities, sharing a religion, and finally, if you do not share an ideology with the target civ, sending a spy as a diplomat in their capital. Going down the Aesthetics policy tree is a must, and some ideology tenets also boost tourism. Unlike other victory types, you can pretty much choose any ideology to boost tourism, though they have different ways to do so. Freedom's the most straightforward, with Media Culture boosting tourism in a city with Broadcast Tower by 34%. Order have two tenets, one boosting Tourism to other Order civs, the other boosting Tourism to civs with less happiness. Autocracy also have two tenets, one generating a one time Tourism boost to all civs anytime a GP is created, the other boosting Tourism to civs fighting a common foe. Make sure to pass Arts Funding in the World Congress.   One last thing, if there is a civ that's shitting out tons of culture or hoarding tons of wonders with theming bonuses, then it might be necessary to conquer them to close the gap. Anyway, good luck!"
civ,3dhi6u,zombifier25,3,Thu Jul 16 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"I always create great work of music through most of the game, then in later eras I start to do concerts. I'm not sure exactly how the mechanics works but, just like great scientists, the more you advance in the game, the more tourism a concert will generate, so I feel like early game musicians doesn't generate enough tourism through concert to make it worth it, being better as a great work in the same way I prefer to create Academies with early scientists then I switch to science boost in later eras, this way they generate more tourism/science over time than they would in a one time boost (theoretically at least, I confess that I never actually did the math)."
civ,3dhi6u,leandrombraz,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:41 2015 UTC,"Ah good point. Forgot to include it. Some of the earlier Great Musician will not generate as much tourism with a concert (about 200 or so), and during this time you'll get more mileage with a Great Work. During the later eras the strength start jumping to the thousands, and the +2 (or +4, 5, etc. depending on your techs) per turn multiplied by the remaining turns of a game will not be able to match that number, so it's better to do a concert."
civ,3dhi6u,zombifier25,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"Great Musicians generate 100 tourism or some value times your tourism output when the GM was born. So there's no point in hoarding them, unless you're not sure who's the culture leader yet.  The fact that GMs generate at least 100 tourism means you can win a very early tourism victory (earlier than Sacred Sites) under a very contrived situation. Apparently it involves:   Choosing 2 opponents - one of them Alexander Go full liberty. Wipe out the non-Greece civ asap. Conquer Greece, but don't touch his capital. Pick the Great Musician for the finisher Gift the capital of the eliminated civ to Greece. Alexander is programmed to always liberate gifted cities. Wipe out Greece Music-bomb the remaining civ. His culture should be less than 100 because he wasn't generating culture while he was eliminated."
civ,3dhi6u,yen223,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Oh is 100 tourism the base level? I didn't know that. However I can further clarify the other part. A Great Musician's tourism strength from a concert is equal to 10 times your tourism output on the turn of your GM's birth. Thus, it can be a great strategy to faith buy GMs if you snag the first place for World Games (doubly so if you are Brazil in a Carnival) because they will be twice as strong as they might be if you buy them in the future."
civ,3dhi6u,civpleb,2,Thu Jul 16 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"Worth noting is that while you can save an early scientist for 200 turns and then pop him for a ton of science, the value for musicians are determined when they are spawned based on your current tourism. Most of the time you will want to make great works from at least 2-3 musicians and maybe as many as 5, and then when you have 100+ tourism and are nearing the end of the game you will do concert tours."
civ,3dhi6u,rabbitlion,6,Thu Jul 16 14:37:27 2015 UTC,Trade great works so you get theming bonus'. They're really important.
civ,3dhi6u,Lunaticen,2,Thu Jul 16 10:35:14 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/HvgyqhmoRCw  Tourism is important (and easy!) even when not going for a cultural victory.
civ,3dhi6u,DushkuHS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"So, culture victory. How to get? Let's assume that it is yet another type of domination for the sake of argument. The culture you generate is your defenesive capability - it gives you policies and also makes you more resistant to other players tourism.  Tourism is your offense here. If you generate enough tourism to overtake somebodys culture, you start gaining influence them (or to stick with the domination metaphor, you make them take damage). Generate enough tourism for a multitude of turns and eventually you are going to be so influential you'll get the ""pop music and blue jeans"" comment from them which means you've beaten that player (dropped his health pool to zero). Now you need to do that to other players.  So, about the specifics. If you get botloads of great works, your tourism is still going to be too weak to achieve that in most cases. This is because without going for theming bonuses, you are not really commiting to this victory type.  Theming bonuses are a way to get more out of your art. In some cultural buildings you get these things called ""great work of art slot"", and if a building has multiple slots, you can get a theming bonus in it. The conditions for getting the bonus are different for these buildings and can be found either here or in the menu where you manage which work goes where (just hover the +0 to check). If done right, you can get 20-80% more tourism depending on your particular setup.  Hope that helps."

civ,3dj6ej,mdf356,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"When producing settlers, food actually provides extra production, but on a diminishing scale. The first extra food is equal to one hammer, which is why 2 food is the same as one food/one hammer. After that however, you need more food to equal one hammer, which is why the second 2 food provides less than one food/one hammer.  Here's a video that goes into more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5vSKAahXT4"
civ,3dj6ej,Foundation_Afro,3,Thu Jul 16 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"Citizens consume 2 food each. While making a Settler, you don't have to feed them at all. If you do however, any excess food will be converted into hammers. The first, second, and fourth EXCESS food will be 1 hammer each. While every 4th food beyond that will be 1 more hammer.  So if you're 3 pop, 7 total food (1 excess) would be +1 hammer, 8 total food would be +2, 10 would be +3, and 14 would be +4."

Organized is a very underrated trait.  It helps that both of Egypt's leaders are Spiritual.

Financial is also very useful since you can expand your empire a lot quicker while maintaining a good research rate since you'll be making a lot more money. If you're going to war monger, charismatic is also very useful as quicker promotions lead to better units. Industrious is also useful since building forges really helps get your small cities able to produce buildings/units and it can come in handy if you're trying to get some specific wonders. Protective is a case by case thing in my experience, it's useful if you're neck deep in war-like neighbors (Hi Montezuma!) but as a human you usually don't need it to survive against the computer"

civ,3dihbf,Cheche888,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"Would be reflective of modern politics (IE nuclear non-proliferation treaty)   This may be true IRL for the moment, but as time progresses I expect we'll have more and more nuclear powers. Look at the causality - USA acquired them so USSR followed; US shared the tech / Research Agreemented it with UK and France; China developed them so India followed so Pakistan followed; the USSR broke down so other ex-Soviet countries Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan had some before willingly giving them up; the US stations some in Israel so Iran wants some so Saudi might want some; North Korea wants to be left alone but can't cope with its overwhelming weakness so it wants some; and South Africa developed them before disassembling its stores.  The pattern: nuclear capability spreads quickly whenever a state feels threatened by its neighbours or other powers with nukes and that state is developed enough and powerful enough / well-connected enough (represented by grabbing the req'd techs and either naturally having Uranium, grabbing or conquering land with Uranium, or getting it through CSs or trade) to develop them.   The exception within the past ~15 years can be chalked up to a period of global peace between major powers and a NPT being signed. When that period passes (note that the very late game breaks away from following the rules of modern politics/warfare and enters the near-future), expect there to be another nuclear arms race. Likely hotspots are Israel/Iran/Saudi/whatever other regional powers are dominant in the Mideast at the time; China/Japan and maybe China/Southeast Asian countries (Thailand etc.); North Korea/South Korea; and if either Russia becomes a major threat or relations break down within the EU, either Russia/Germany or UK/France/Germany.  The game as of BNW represents all of these mechanics through beaker requirements and limited stores of uranium allowing only the dominant civs access (or at least quick access) to nukes, the fact that when civs are threatened they are more likely to prioritize nuclear development and vice-versa, and WC's NPT proposition."

civ,3dhst2,Svetimsalis,2,Thu Jul 16 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"Being so far behind in science in 2002, it's very unlikely that you'll win a science victory. If it's the first time you play Prince difficulty (the 4th one) and you want to win a scientific victory, you should probably start with Korea or Babylon, to make it easier. I won my 2 Prince difficulty science victories with those Civs, they are the science specialists.  I'm a noob myself, and I'm finding it easier to start with Tradition + tall empire (3-4 cities to start with) rather than Liberty + large empire. I found a guide from CivFanatics for this that works quite well (though you won't be able to steal so many workers in Prince difficulty): http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=523371  I'm guessing the guy who betrayed you is Pachcuti (Inca). It's good that they keep fighting Persia, but if you couldn't use this war to get ahead of them, you were probably doing things wrong from the beginning. Did you rush libraries in the early game? Did you get National College in your capital as soon as possible? Did you use your great scientist for academies in the early game, and for ""light bulbs"" only in the late game? If the answers to all of these questions aren't ""yes"", you are probably not doing the best for a science victory.  Judging by your description it's too late now, you'll probably have to start over. The 100 first turns are key, and if you played them wrong you won't be able to fix things in 2002. Oh, and when playing as a peaceful Civ, remember to keep a decent, up to date, military, to avoid invasions from warmongers. If your army is weak they'll want to attack you all the time."

Guy who betrayed me is Askia The Pious of Songhai... but once I started war with persians they declared peace, since then persians redirected all force to me.  I don't even remember what I did at beginning, probably I decided to go with science way later than that.  I also started war with persians of despise, they kept stealing from me numerous times, told them to stop but nooo... other nations were informing me that they're planing against me so here's that..."
civ,3dhst2,DrCron,2,Thu Jul 16 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"From what I have experienced until now (1 victory in chieftain to learn, 3 victories in prince) Civ5 is indeed easier than Civ4, but you still need to learn all the new mechanics. That's why I played my first game in Chieftain, so I could get an easy win despite lots of early mistakes.   AFTER that first game I read some strategy articles from CivFanatics, and got enough to play Prince without many issues. Basically you need to know that National College in the early game is necessary pretty much for every game if you don't want to lag in science. Since National College requires a library in each city, you need to rush libraries and build National College while you still have only a few cities (no more than 4, ideally).  Oh, and remember that, unlike Civ4, cities in Civ5 can defend themselves, so you don't need a unit on each early city to defend it from barbarians or the AI early (weak) units. You can have just 1 ranged unit in the early game, and take it from barbarian camp to barbarian camp, to get some easy early gold. Leave the cities empty from garrisons during the first 30-50 turns, they'll be fine bombarding any near barbarians."
civ,3dhst2,parkerpyne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"Yep I used mostly ranged units against barbarians, even built few more and send those as scouts to scout continent and make money out of those barbarians in land far away from home.  Well, thanks for the link and info provided, guess its time to restart. :)"
civ,3dhst2,DushkuHS,2,Sat Jul 18 07:05:11 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're done. You obviously will be if you give up two thirds of your cities. You also seem to lag behind considerably in techs so a science victory seems unlikely.  If you're lucky you might be able to escape without giving up those cities. The only way this can happen however is a stronger military. What's your most advanced unit? You need to crank them out now. If they are attacking with bombers, place an anti-aircraft gun two tiles within range of a cluster of your units and cities. They are quite effective against bombers (albeit not stealth bombers).  Other than that, plain infantry is a strong melee unit that is hard to kill. Get the barrage promotion and move them out of your cities to fortify them on rough terrain tiles. Being fortified for two turns increases combat strength by 40%. Such a unit will withstand bombers and artillery very well.  Your goal is simply to kill as many enemy units as you can. The AI looks at your military manpower (look under Demographics). If you are doing alright there, you will get favorable peace conditions. They might even offer you a city of their own if you kill enough of them.   You also need ranged units. An appropriately promoted Artillery is a must as it can bombard from three tiles away. You need three or four to focus-fire on particular tiles where the enemy is passing through. If all you have are Cannons, there is probably nothing you can do at this point.  I guess your mistake was to get drawn into that war that provided no benefits to you. If you are going for a science victory, you turtle up and build only enough military to deter the AIs from attacking you. War is incredibly expensive and instead of building the infrastructure necessary for a science victory you are now forced to crank out units that additionally eat into your GPT.  If you go to war, keep it as short as possible. Attack and take an enemy's capital and then offer peace. Losing a capital pretty much takes any AI out of the game. What you don't want are long grinding wars where you are only nibbling on the edge of your opponent's empire."

It's begging the question without the integrity of acknowledging that we know the answers. Human nature is to adapt, nothing more.  When a developing mind (child) is forming, it adapts to its environment. Allison Glopnik has published her findings that humans are naturally empathetic. We are capable of differentiating between aggression and nurturing in our ""peers"" at a very young age. Not long after that, a child will even go so far as to reward nurturing and ostracize aggression. This is no surprise since humans tend to be of the K reproductive strategy. Meaning we are social animals with in-group preferences. No childhood trauma, no psychopathy and therefore no human aggression.  Philosophically speaking, you cannot derive an ought from an is. To look at centuries of human subjugation and warfare and conclude that this is how man is would be like looking at a ferocious dog that's been starved and beaten its whole life and concluding that dogs are feral. Traumatized dogs are feral. Just like traumatized children have the capacity for aggression. Hitler was beaten into a coma by his father numerous times.  The Origins of War in Child Abuse by Lloyd Demause is available for free as audio here: https://freedomainradio.com/free/  Anybody truly curious on this topic has access to nearly unlimited research on the subject. The science is quite clear. But it requires the ability to look at a problem and ask WHY, rather than just assuming as the author of that article has."

There is a short window where missionaries are useful. Ever use missionaries to convert cities of a different religion and you know what I'm talking about. Borbodour is great because it kickstarts your religion. The first 20-30 turns after enhancing a religion is crucial to how your religion ends up. If you get Borbodour you will get 3 missionaries in those crucial turns, making your religion spread early and cover more land and cities"

With the discount, I was cranking out one missionary every two turns and was able to have 3 in 6 turns, each with the power to spread 3 times, thus making 9 religion spreads with 6 turns while producing other stuff. In double that time I could build Borobudur without the GM for 6 religion spreads.  Basically, what I'm saying is that it all depends on how much faith you're generating to know if its worth it. I still build Borobudur if I have time, for the extra faith and missionaries. But if you can only build one, weigh it on your faith output."

civ,3dg6mv,DushkuHS,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"Borbodour is generally better because of the timing. It allows you to spread your religion abroad long before anyone else can, which can keep it from being squashed by AI missionary spam. That being said, if you're playing a piety game, Great Mosque works really well with some of the policies and beliefs, namely evangelism. Having a fixed-price miniature great prophet pretty much means you can religiously dominate the world with enough faith generation. The free mosque doesn't hurt either, especially if your religion doesn't already have them (it should really read +3 faith, +2 culture,+1 happiness).   There isn't really a right way to play (unless you're trying to beat deity or something), so just choose whichever seems like more fun. Besides, since Great Mosque requires piety and doesn't need to be built in a holy city, there's no reason why you can't build both!"

By having three missionaries spreading your religion simultaneously, you could feel the effects of your religion immediately. Great Mosque does allow for a longer life for your religion and even allows bought Great Prophets to spread religion once and then plant a holy site, but because religion isn't as important later in the game as science is, people tend to downplay it."

civ,3d9jql,FrenchLama,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"You can see which possible trade routes are the most lucrative in the trade route overview - it's not always from the capital, but often any trade route to a certain city.  Of course that could be dangerous in case the owner of that city decides to declare war, so I try to spread them a little even though I get a few GPT less."
civ,3d9jql,the_omega99,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:41:59 2015 UTC,"overall I doubt that is more then 25 turns worth of production from each city.  max trade routes, some trade depots, a lot of policies (especially autocracy) allow for one huge military"
civ,3d9jql,amer1juana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Also. If you use all trade routes (make sure they're the highest GPT yield), trade all resources for GPT, and really maximize your gold with buildings (banks, markets, etc) you'll have no issue supporting that much military. Limit unnecessary buildings if they add little value. Add commerce policy if necessary, and build colossus for an extra trade route, too. Try to get religious spread with Tithe, too."
civ,3d9jql,FrenchLama,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"all trade routes (make sure they're the highest GPT yield)   Already do that.   trade all resources for GPT   Wouldn't that completely ruin my happiness ?   Limit unnecessary buildings if they add little value   Is it really a problem ? If so, any example ?"
civ,3d9jql,sameth1,2,Wed Jul 15 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that completely ruin my happiness ?   You only get happiness for each resource type. So trade extra resources away.   Is it really a problem ? If so, any example ?   It's a huge problem. Take a look at the maintenance costs of buildings. It's usually 1-3 GPT per building. So 5 unnecessary buildings each in 5 cities would cost you 25-75 GPT. And wide empires can do a lot worse, especially if you capture a city with unnecessary buildings (sell them).  Also, unnecessary workers can be deleted to free up GPT. Easier to make new workers when you get new techs which would create more work.  Roads are another thing that haven't been mentioned. Each tile of road costs 1 GPT. A good rule of thumb is to build roads between cities only if the number of road tiles needed is equal to or less than the population of the unconnected city. It's usually a bad idea to build extra roads, but can have temporary uses for helping get units to the front lines of war faster.  Do be sure to get all the economic buildings whenever you can. They're always worth getting. They don't cost maintenance."
civ,3d9jql,Moonsya,2,Wed Jul 15 06:09:04 2015 UTC,"I should have been more specific.    If there's a luxury to trade for, trade straight up. If there's nothing to receive in return, take GPT. basically leave no resource unused or untraded.  Many times you don't need workshops, or windmills, or barracks, or armories or even harbors in some cases. Buildings that aren't paying off enough to warrant the GPT they cost shouldn't be built. Workshops for instance give a 10% increase in production but might not be worth 2 GPT in some cities; especially if you aren't planning on using trade routes to send production from that city.  Under developed tiles, unnecessary units, and too many roads can increase costs, too."

civ,3d9jql,TotallyNotanOfficer,8,Tue Jul 14 16:47:23 2015 UTC,You could have taken Cologne with 5 frigates and a privateer in a couple turns. Bombard from the sea => slip in a melee naval unit into the defenseless city. Then land ground troops to occupy/destroy forts.
civ,3d9jql,DaerionB,6,Tue Jul 14 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"I thought the naval aspect of the assault in general was a bit weak. A good navy can be really potent for taking cities. You pretty much only need the melee units to defend the city from other melee units. The navy can do all the damage and taking of cities.  You'll notice in the pictures that there's too many privateers (you'd typically use ranged units only for the assault, using melee units solely to capture the city). Also, the privateers are taking up spots that a ranged ship could use. As a result, he can't perform as many attacks on the coastal cities as he should be.  His techs seem at a unfortunate point, too. He's got GW infantry but no battleships (which are just slightly ahead in the techtree). As a result, his navy is way behind in military strength."

civ,3dew40,thedoctorwaffle,15,Wed Jul 15 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"The sad answer is that depending on your early neighbors, you may have to cripple your early growth somewhat, and make up for it later by heavily focusing infrastructure after you have a reasonably strong army. The key is not falling behind further in the meantime. A few tips:   Know your neighbors. Probably a pretty obvious tip, but worth mentioning. Gandhi isn't as big a problem as Attila. Keep barbarians on. They distract the AI's military and can be used by you for a few levels of XP per unit. Get promotions whenever you can, whether it's farming a little XP from a city-state (if you stole their worker, which you should do) or from barbarians. A small, highly promoted army can destroy larger forces. Instead of early buildings, it's often worthwhile to pop a Caravan, especially on Deity. It gives you a lot of science and moderate early GPT to trade with your advanced neighbors, and I've found that establishing a trade route often makes neighbors more friendly (I haven't looked at the DLL to confirm, but this may have to do with the fact that it ""increases"" their cost of declaring war on you because they'd lose the mutual trade). This science and gold can help you offset some of the costs of not building infrastructure right away. Rush Composite Bowmen, at least a couple (2-4) per border city. If you can, try to only expose 1-2 of your cities to possible enemy invasion. The AI generally prioritizes cities to attack by distance. If your early borders are the ocean and tundra and then one or two angry neighbors who are off in the same direction, then you can devote all your units to defending the city that is closest to those two neighbors. Bribe your neighbor at the last minute. It's cheap, but with a well placed scouting unit (doesn't have to be a Scout) you can often see the your neighbor marching toward your land before a war declaration. At that time, you can still bribe them to declare war on someone else, which will almost always cause them to turn around and take their death march elsewhere. A less known tip that many Deity players use: consider Honor. The bonuses can help your early military, especially when it comes to racking up promotions, but it really pays off to get the Honor finisher (Gold per unit killed) early in games when you know you will be a meat grinder for the opposing AI's carpets of doom. It's an extremely profitable finisher, and you know what you can buy with all that gold? Growth and science buildings! (Or more units and unit upgrades, if you've gotten bored and want to take over the world.) ...note that this is mainly a Deity tip, maybe Immortal. There aren't enough enemy units for this to be profitable on Emperor and below.   Hope this helps. Happy hunting!"

He and Poland (who was directly north of me on my continent) were allies, and both had a huge military approaching my country. After I wiped out his entire naval military escort within a few turns (I fucking love subs, so I usually have like 10 of them at the least) I proceeded in moving forward with the attack and just obliterated the west of his continent.

On top of that you crossing the seas requires sailing, and barbarians hunt down scouts with a vengeance. I don't know. I'm not actually the best civ player in the world, I play on prince.  We played a standard earth map, and I lucked out alone on South America (so much jungle-culture!) as Poland, while she was stuck in China and surrounded as Denmark. Once we got our bearings I sent over some ships to find her, and then a settler to start a forward operation base.  Once I got that set up, things happened smoothly. I could easily defend my homeland in South America, and we could trade and conduct military campaigns across Asia from her homeland in china and my base in northern Russia, but I was in the Industrial era by the time all that was set up.  In our latest game, we started at a team in the Mediterranean, playing with themed Civs. I started on the Italian peninsula as Babylon, and she started in north Africa as Rome, against two other teams of 2 As (Persia + Egypt, Greece & Venice.) I figured we were close enough, but as it turns out most of the Mediterranean sea is tiled as ocean, so we can't link up with classical ships.   But I think the biggest problem is honestly barbarians. Laugh at me if you want, but I can only blunder my way into so many massed barbarian strongholds before my scouts are toast."

You're about 2000x smarter than the AI, and all they have to make up for it are bonuses.  Civ on high difficulty levels is a fundamentally asymmetric game. Figuring out how to overcome the AI's advantages is literally the objective of the game once you're past the beginner levels. It's just how the game (and really, basically its entire genre) is designed.  It would be great if the game's AI were smarter and didn't need advantages, but that's just not the game we're playing.  Having said all that, on high levels the AI will always win via one victory condition or another if you leave them alone long enough and don't win first. Think of it as a race, one you need to win by being faster or just crippling the people who pull ahead of you. The Iroquois are also one of (if not the) most consistently dangerous AIs in the game, so keep an eye out for them. Especially if they have an isolated start or room to expand."

You could go your whole life without seeing a game that's designed ""right."" Let's hope it doesn't come to that, but it might.  There's much room for improvement in V's AI, but ultimately you're always going to end up with a game that's either too easy once you get skilled, or a game with ""cheating"" opponents. Even GalCiv II, basically the gold standard for 4x AIs, had cheating on the highest levels.  I do hope they improve it, but seriously. If a game is making you so frustrated that you need to write a rant about how upset you are, then you're not doing yourself a favor by taking the stance that the industry needs to change rather than your expectations.

The reason for this is because Hiawatha's bias chart actually pushes him towards a more effective strategy than the AI tends to take.  He's very expansive and also very likely to pursue a science victory, so if he has a lot of room to expand, he'll use his AI-bonuses quite effectively to go ICS and focus on science in all those cities.  I've lost several games to Hiawatha getting a space victory, it's actually something I specifically watch for now. I also avoid playing ""Continents"" on deity since, if he gets his own continent, the game can be essentially unwinnable. By the time you're able to reach him, he'll have like 30 damn cities and be in the modern era or something silly like that.  So yeah, his UA/UB both kind of suck but it doesn't matter just because he's ""smarter"" than many of the other opponents."

I've actually never had a single (ancient era start) game where nukes made any meaningful difference, and I usually don't bother unlocking them unless I'm so far ahead that I have nothing better to do.  They're flashy and all, but the opportunity cost is huge. Most, if not all, the time, you can do just as much damage with some +XP buildings and a bunch of stealth bombers...and you can reuse the bombers.

I hope this is the start of a new trend on /r/civ, especially now that the ai games are dying down."

For Sardinia-Piedmont, one of the AIs is probably taking an action that is breaking the game.  Pay attention to which AI's turn it is when the game crashes to get an idea.  Try reloading from an earlier save, the AI may take different actions.  If that doesn't work, you may need to use IGE to mess around with the offending AI until it stops bugging out."

civ,3dctwo,SkulduggeryDude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:54:56 2015 UTC,Even if I'm going bad I usually wouldn't do this as its a temporary fix. A good idea is to change the focus of your cities to production. But really the best way is to avoid falling behind in the first place
civ,3dctwo,tirouge0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:12:56 2015 UTC,"Let me explain. In my current game, Persia is snowballing. It happens. I'm playing wide and didn't open tradition nor liberty just for the sake of it. I bought public schools in my main cities to get  extra science as fast as possible. As I said, sometimes you have to buy buildings and it's not a big deal as long as you have a good economy. Most of the time, on high difficulties, you're still behind in mid game. You have to catch up for most of the game. Buying science buildings is a way to deal with this problem."

civ,3dctwo,skysbringer,8,Thu Jul 16 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"1) Vision is very important. Get a scout up as soon as you can to find your neighbours and places for your next few cities.  2) Be careful of taking barbarian camps with 1 unit. I've lost a lot of warriors to a barb that randomly spawns.  3) You probably won't get the Great Library if you're playing on anything higher than Prince.  4) Tradition>>>Liberty for players who don't know how to play wide, so I highly recommend starting Tradition.  5) You can change your city's focus (food, production, science, gold, etc) by clicking on it. Learning how to micromanage your citizens is pivotal to winning at high difficulties.  6) Don't rush a worker until you have the tech for luxuries.  7) Ghandi always builds nukes when possible, and will always nuke you if you declare war.  Have fun!"
civ,3dctwo,100centuries,6,Wed Jul 15 07:19:30 2015 UTC,1)Don't automate workers.   2)Rush all the Science Buildings  3)Work all science specialist slots.  4)Use your first few Great Scientists for academies.

civ,3dctwo,DushkuHS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:51:58 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best advice. Like, I could offer you a tip about great people and you'd just be like ""great people, what's that?"" Because it's an aspect of later in the game that might not be obvious at first. That's how the game is. You'll play one full game, see parts of the later game you didn't realize were in it. Then your next game, you'll be doing your thing while trying to keep the later game in mind. THEN after you've played a few games, you can check out beginners guides and what they're saying is stuff you can actually identify.  In the meantime, just make sure the advisers are turned on and try to use them as a GUIDE, but not as the end all be all of how you should be spending your time and effort."
civ,3dctwo,jeff0,2,Wed Jul 15 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"One big place where Civ V differs from other 4X games (including the previous Civs), is that cities are pretty good at defending themselves. On the one hand, this means you don't need to worry too much about defense in the early game, but on the other, it means when you're trying to capture a city it will often take a larger force than you'd expect.  Also, capturing a city-state is a good way to piss off every other civilization. You generally have a lot more to gain by befriending them than attacking them."
civ,3dctwo,Ranal___Ape,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:49:06 2015 UTC,Siege units are pretty good at defense.
civ,3dctwo,Bragior,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:09:13 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, they cannot take hits, but because they're ranged, they usually can take out the attackers attacking them. Additionally, once you get the Artillery, they can attack through difficult terrain (which normally reduces range) for as long as they have a spotter.  Exceptions to this rule: Battering Rams (The Huns) and Siege Towers (Assyria) are melee siege units that can only attack cities (but they're good at it). They can still be upgraded into Trebuchets, however."
civ,3dctwo,dasaard200,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Normally a 2 : 1 range to melee ratio is a good idea for defense and offense .  Escort workers and settlers with troops .  Never strip Home Force to attack .  You can build extra units over the manpower cap, to settle your next city, by 1-3 (warrior, archer, settler) to get to next city-site .

civ,3dajf6,libfud,36,Wed Jul 15 00:27:08 2015 UTC,"Growth Über Alles. Growth wins games. Now, many people will tell me how this is wrong and how they can turtle science all their way to victory. Okay, sure, you can, in SP, or you could have won 30-50 turns earlier by being large. This means a couple of things:   Expand. 3-4 cities are a minimum by mid-game. You don't have to go beyond this number unless your land supports it. Just because Tradition only gives free buildings to your first four cities does not mean it's a limit you must follow.  Do not build cities that will be optimal in 200 turns. Build cities that will grow fast and start contributing to your empire in the short to medium term. Building cities at the minimum distance is sometimes the right decision. The 3rd ring is basically out of reach until late game unless you're Shoshone, it's your capital, or you're planning to spend money to buy those borders (and you should do this if it's a crucial luxury or strategic resource). I cannot stress this enough. I see people (either posting SP screenshots or in MP) that have 'nowhere to settle' yet they have great lands and are terrified that their cities overlap. Who cares? You need 36 population to work every single tile, and then another 4 for the Science Buildings, 3-4 for the Engineering Buildings, and up to another 6 if it's your Guild City. You will almost never reach this population so don't stress it.  Focus on food (if you're new you can just set the city focus to food, otherwise be aware of the production-focus trick) as much as possible. If you're rushing a wonder or you're low in happiness switching to production makes sense. Of course you always want to work academies but when you sacrifice food for production you're trading off mid to long term benefits for immediate benefits. Make sure those immediate benefits are worth the cost. If your terrain is grasslands you will often need to set aside some production though.  Be cognizant of the technologies that help you with Food. Typically the important ones here are Civil Service and Fertilizer. Of course some CiVs are different (i.e. Inca) and have more Food Technologies. Aqueducts are critical, this is the Tradition Finisher so do not hop around, finish Tradition ASAP. If you're not doing Tradition then you need to build these once you get Engineering.  Use internal trade routes. Cargo ships if you can. Internal trade routes let you basically materialize food and production. You need a Granary to send food from one city to another. Be aware of the technologies that give you additional routes and make sure you're always utilizing as much of these as you can.  Of course you can't neglect military, culture or science. Be aware of those critical science technologies and buildings and have them as a priority (bee-lining is not recommended), as well as military techs. In SP culture is pretty important as well due to the huge chasm between you and the AI in terms of culture generation.  On a tangent: The best military is the smallest that can accomplish your particular objectives. If you're new to the game and playing defensively you'll probably need a fairly big army. Once you get better at war you will find that defense with a relatively small army is pretty easy to do. Every military unit you build means sacrificing your infrastructure and growth in some way. Avoid losses (this may sound silly, but the amount of players that simply seem to suicide their units for no tactical advantage is just too high)."
civ,3dajf6,Aea,4,Tue Jul 14 20:58:26 2015 UTC,What's the production focus trick? Is that the one where you set the city to production 1 turn before a new person is born?
civ,3dajf6,kingp1ng,9,Tue Jul 14 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily a turn before (although that's even more optimal), you have the city set to ""production"" (as the focus for the governor) and then manually assign all tiles.

civ,3dajf6,ithinkofdeath,10,Wed Jul 15 12:24:19 2015 UTC,"How to do surgical warfare. If you just want to punish someone a bit for forward settling your or sending a prophet to your lands, but want to still avoid eveyone else hating on you.   Make friends with other people. Your first move shouldn't be ""shall we wage war against..."", rather send them trade routes, make deals and test the waters by denouncing your nemesis. Your friends will become doubtful of the guy their bff just denounced (sometimes it's more straightforward if your target has indeed been a dick to the rest of the world) and won't be too bothered if you whack mr. Bad Guy with a DoW. Secure your assets. Before you DoW, make sure you know what you're against, both inside their territories and outside. Be aware of locations where your trade routes could be plundered or where a horseman could burn up all your farms in an area. Also be mindful of possible city-states you could bribe to join your cause (especially the ones allied with your enemy!). Going by another commenter, don't overcommit with military spending, and learn what size of an army you need for a given situation. For a single-city hit, you won't actually need to throw blood and murder at the enemy gates, rather squander any troops that they may send outside their city radius. Intimidate for a profitable peace treaty. Taking a city in a peace deal won't give you a warmonger penalty, and saves you for sending troops to the most risky situation. In addition to sniping easy kills, if you plunder trade routes, pillage tiles and capture civilians and generally field a lot of firepower near their cities (for this purpose, don't underestimate mounted units for their supreme movement), you can usually have them donate the city or a whole bunch of resources for peace."

civ,3dajf6,WikiWarrior55,11,Tue Jul 14 20:56:11 2015 UTC,Also worth mentioning is that you can steal a worker from a CS and then instantly peace out. Generally this is going to be from the closest CS that you don't really care much about.
civ,3dajf6,Aea,3,Tue Jul 14 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should do this except at the higher difficulty levels. It may even be better at the higher levels to declare against a different civ just to the steal their works, which simultaneously cripples them AND doesn't piss off a potential ally. Sometimes the map or circumstances doesn't permit it though, so it's no big deal.  However, I won't deny that having a worker that much earlier isn't a huge help, but I don't think you should be doing it below Immortal where it's much more urgent to catch up."
civ,3dajf6,libfud,9,Wed Jul 15 00:26:27 2015 UTC,"What's your rationale for this? There are typically 2 CSs per CiV, and you are very unlikely to befriend more then one in the early game before the penalty fades. It's a one-time -60 to the CS you declare war on, that recovers quickly enough that if done against a CS you don't care about (i.e. not the bonus you want, or bad luxes, etc) it doesn't hurt you in the least. I've often become allies with the same CS I stole a worker from centuries / millennia earlier."
civ,3dajf6,Aea,2,Wed Jul 15 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the big issue on Emperor and below is the worker from CS comes a bit late, because they produce things slower.

civ,3dajf6,delfador,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"My rationale for why it's so cheesy is that you gain so immensely from something with a consequence so small that it may as well be nonexistant, aside from not becoming an ally with them for longer. Stealing a worker from an AI at least involves an actual risk.  On second thought, there are some other risks associated with declaring on a city state for a worker. For one, if you do it to two city states, you'll take a permanent diplo-penalty with all city states that takes you to -20 influence. For another, if you do it to a city state that's under the protection of another civ, it'll piss off that civ. So again, this advice should read as something like ""with higher difficulty levels, you should consider stealing one city state's worker if you don't care about making them an ally soon, and they're not under the protection of another civ.""  The option exists to demand a worker as tribute, which will again piss off civs that have that CS under their protection and drop your influence by 60 points, but will only work if your military is strong enough to do it, and they're large enough for it to be a valid demand. Pulling it off in the stage of the game where it'd actually be worthwhile is next to impossible on the difficulty levels where you most want it anyway."

Of course, this doesn't mean neglect your science, it just means that you actually need to back your diplomacy up with a big stick, and be the world police. There's nothing scarier in the end game than a civ that's run away all game long and eaten up ALL of your neighbors leaving you and it. So while you're teching up, pay attention to world diplomacy. Look at the demographics and see who has the largest standing military, and if you use the info-addict mod, see who the tech leaders are, and link up those numbers with their military manpower, science rate and number of cities. Watch out for a civ that suddenly eats 3 or 4 of another civ's cities, especially when they take a capital. If they take two capitals, reprioritize to cripple that AI ASAP."
civ,3dajf6,libfud,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"Is this really ideal?  I feel when I play, I prioritize food -> production -> science -> military.

civ,3dajf6,explosivewangz,3,Wed Jul 15 15:24:16 2015 UTC,"So, maybe this seems too basic, but I've seen let's play videos where they didn't know:  When attacking a city, if the city is brought down to 1 health, your melee unit that takes the city will always survive and take the city.  Also, I generally avoid attacking cities with melee units, but there are times when it can pay off, like if it helps you take the city that turn. Make sure you can heal up the melee units though.  With ranged units, watch out for terrain. Ranged units can't fire over hills, forest, or jungle. This really pissed me off when I first started playing. If you place a range unit on a hill, I believe it can fire over forest and jungle, as well as over other hills. I'm not sure though. Later game ranged units are different. Artillery and Battleships have indirect fire, so as long as it's in sight, you can hit it if it's in range. And of course planes ignore terrain stuff as well.  It's a dangerous tactic (that might not work at higher levels, idk), but if you see another civ's settler, you can declare war and capture it, turning it into a worker. Only do this in the extremely early game. I've only done this on King. And it's earned me some nasty wars later on in the game, although in the early game the AI usually just wants peace. So probably don't do this, but if you're like me and you're tired of there being three AI settlers trying to settle your second city location (Germany got it by the way), I say go for it on lower levels.  I don't know about higher levels, but never underestimate gunboat diplomacy (tier 3 autocracy). It allows you to have a huge military, spread out across the map, and all the city state alliances you make are really powerful. Plus, almost any city state near your cities will end up being impossible for anyone else to ally with.  As for personal opinion, I always find myself wanting The Forbidden Palace, and if I have a Great Engineer, I usually rush it. The extra two votes in the world congress, plus the unhappiness reduction, are very helpful in my opinion.  And finally, if you meet Alexander, fuck him good. If you can, eliminate him from the game. He's such a jackass. And Maria Theresa can be quite the bitch herself, or at least in my experience. But Alexander will grab those city state alliances and never ever let go."

Sometimes it's not a bad idea to DOW on a weaker civ, even if you have no way to reach them from across the map. A lot of times if one of my allys comes to me requesting to join them in a DOW I'll accept. If you just have a larger military standing around, even if you don't attack them, they will often offer a city in peace negotiations. sometimes it's useful, sometimes I'll just raze it. In my last play through as Venice, the Iroquois were posing as a threat and Japan asked me to go to war with them. I didn't have the military to go into an all out war, but I did have enough to take a small city to raze and then I was gifted another city as part of peace negotiations, which I also razed. that set him back a bit. Also in that same game, my highest trade city was a city I puppeted as a part of peace negotiations with Arabia."

Once you move up past prince/king you'll be behind in score for most of the game, and on deity it's not uncommon to win while being dead last in score.  Also: It's okay to be behind in tech. Don't stress out if you aren't keeping up with the AI in the early game, you can always catch up later if you focus on science. This especially applies on difficulties above prince, where the AI starts with free techs (up to 5 on deity among other bonuses) on turn 0 by design. It isn't the end of the world if you are 5 techs behind your neighbor (in fact such a situation is quite common on immortal and deity), and getting out of this mindset that you need to keep up with the AI helps you a ton when progressing through the difficulties."

civ,3d9cok,Tacoaloto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"How about instead of the ship being destroyed due to RNG, implement the wind currents and have an RNG chance to move a ship into deep ocean if it's on shore (before astronomy), and the turn it happens it'll take 10% damage, then 45% damage the next two turns, and has reduced movement but it is restored if it gets back to coastal tiles.  Edit: Your galley has entered a strong wind current, displacing it one tile and taking 10 damage from entering ocean.  -turn 2: (chance of displacement: 10%) Your ship gets pushed further into the ocean, many crew members are beginning to starve to death and your ship takes 45 damage.  -turn 3: Your ship hits a strong current and water overfloods the ship, causing it to sink and washing up to the coast. Move to the shipwreck location within 5 turns to restore it's remains.  Speaking of that, possibly going to the shipwreck causes you to gain a small amount of food and a small amount of production, that degrades over the 5 turns. Also, if you fail to go to the shipwreck, the tile gets harder to navigate, costing 1 extra movement for the next 15 turns."

Basically, I was made to read it in school and I wasn't too fond of the overall tone of the story, so getting through the book was a trudge. Not that I have a problem with literature, I devoured Les Misérables as a pre-teen, and in retrospect I cannot say anything about the literary merit of Maupassant's work.  (Spoiler-ish explanation below !)  I found the story very bleak, with characters who had little in the way of redeeming value (even the heroine, whom I found it hard to root for IIRC). That was probably deliberate on the author's part, but because of that the whole thing seemed awfully long; it does follow the protagonist during her whole life (hence the title), and at some point you can't help wishing life would give her a break already."
civ,3d5wil,Garlstadt,2,Tue Jul 14 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, did the same in school. (Education in France).  And, in addition of being realistic, IIRC, Maupassant's view on life was pretty bleak and pessimistic, view that was passed onto Une Vie; lotsa shit happenin', but not because of an evil mastermind or antagonistic figure, just life following its course. (The subsequent lack of clear cut quest or goal also lengthens the story, IMO).

You can configure it to upload files with hotkeys. Eg, I have it so that ctrl + prt sc is rectangular selection, alt + prt sc is window selection, and prt sc is a full screen selection. Holding shift at the same time does the same thing, but also uploads it to imgur. If there's no history, the available hotkeys are shown (I captured this image with shift + alt + prt sc -- note how it even has the shadow right, yet doesn't get any other windows). After a capture (or upload), a preview is shown that lets you quickly access it (local captures are copied to the clipboard and uploads copy the URL to the clipboard). Need to edit the screenshot (eg, to add text or diagrams) before upload? I made this video (captured with ShareX) to demonstrate how to streamlined that process is."

From alerting you to when CSs are ripe from tribute, to prominently displaying what resources the AI has and/or is willing to buy/trade for/with.  The only other one I use is InfoAddict in DLC form:  http://www.mediafire.com/download/egu5xf03ssmbxgt/InfoAddict.zip  While not a necessity, it can get you access to current data like military strength, as well as displaying trends."

civ,3dc1tu,lax_br0,2,Wed Jul 15 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry yourself too much on the specs. I have an i7-4770, a GTX970, 32 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB SSD as my system drive and the game doesn't make use of half of that. In fact, it runs as if it wasn't optimized at all. In other words, past the point of what would mostly be called a budget PC by today's standards, throwing more hardware at it won't get you any further. In fact, you're better off splurging on the CPU than the GPU if Civ 5 is your jam."
civ,3dc1tu,DushkuHS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:11:42 2015 UTC,"Hello! As a member of the PC Master race, I would first recommend you build your own computer, as the experience and money saving overweigh risk in my opinion. Now off to your question. Firstly, Civ V is a mainly CPU dependant game, and having a good CPU will create a much better gaming experience than a gpu IN CIV V as you can live with all low on integrated graphics, but die for 100sec waits on 40civ TSL. However that does NOT mean splurge all your money on a CPU. Now tbh is not a good time to build a PC due to many computer stuff coming out in the future. But if you really wish to build or buy one now (now is fine, as the new stuff is higher end anyway) then I recommend something at least around a 750TI and i5 processor (4460, 4690 if you have money). If you want the best bang for buck, try a GTX 970, if you mostly play 1080p, or a R9 290x for higher rez. If your room gets cold I recommend the r9 290x even at 1080p. Feel free to ask more questions or even a parts list or computer choice. I can pick one/show parts if you supply budget and area."

Just know the further a city is placed from your capital, the more it's gonna drag on your economy.  Secondly, watch that slider in the upper left about what percentages your using towards science, income, and culture.  Play around with them in the early game and you'll see what I mean.    That was basically .1% of the advice you should know, but just go have some fun!"
civ,3daqa3,LibertarianSocialism,2,Tue Jul 14 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer III over IV. Especially now. III looks very clean while IV looks cluttered.  And if you do play III, I recommend France and their unkillable musketeers"
civ,3daqa3,Eat-the-Rich,2,Tue Jul 14 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"As you can probably tell from my flair I'm a huge fan of Civ4 and here's how I got really into the game. (This is mostly advice for you just being a beginner, so once you figure out the game don't be afraid to disregard anything/everything I say!)   Create a custom scenario and choose the ""world"" option and then play as Rome. This is a scaled map of the world with 9 of the earths oldest civilizations that start where they are located IRL and will start you off on a map you're (hopefully) familiar with  Set difficulty to Warlord (just a little easier than normal difficulty, really it just gives you a bit extra gold and happiness) and turn off barbarians (turning off barbarians will just ease you into the early game without pissing you off by losing workers/settlers) and personally I set speed to epic and win conditions to domination/conquest but that's up to you. (You might wanna turn off time victory though that's just lame) Settle your city where the unit spawns and send your warrior unit west to where Spain would be (after exploring the ruins you can just set him to explore). Build a worker and start to research ""Mysticism"" and then ""Polytheism"" (doing so will make Rome the holy city for Hinduism one of the earliest religions in the game and this will help you later with gold and early with culture. Also you may notice meditation is faster to get and also gives you a religion but all the other Civs know this too and usually one will get Buddhism but leave Hinduism to you)  Once your worker is finished you can just automate him (bad habit but it's ok first time around) and then you can build as you see fit (but I recommend building Stonehenge as its a great early pick up and then a settler)  Settle your next city where Spain would be (IMO the best spot would be the flat tile in the middle just to the right of the hill) and try to unlock the ""iron working"" tech Once you have iron working just spam pretorians. I think they're the most OP unit in this scenario and once you have about 10 Germany and Greece don't stand a chance. I think a good start here is to take a lot of the German cities, but you don't need to completely eliminate Germany. Taking all their cities like this will hurt them... A lot. They will most likely retreat north to where the Scandinavian countries are and will never recover. Do the same to Greece but you will probably wipe them out because of you founded a religion your borders might have expanded so fast they couldn't get a settler far away enough from Athens.  As you conquer try to build 1 worker per city then work on the buildings (focusing on production first) and always keep your most productive cities spamming praetorians (also build catapults to bombard city defences!)  If you have enough pretorians left over you might be able to take Thebes from Egypt and maybe even Memphis (almost always settled south and slightly west of Thebes)  Once you have taken a lot of cities (and more importantly crippled some competing Civs) you can just work on the buildings in your cities (only do this once you've noticed pretorians aren't as strong as they used to be try to keep the pretorian pain train going while you can). Then try to get rifling as soon as possible because they will be your next huge military power spike but don't just beeline for them. Once you have riflemen spam them again (in cities that are still developing maybe build 2 buildings then 1 rifleman) and that will get you through Persia (if pretorians didn't) and India (remember that the goal isn't necessarily to wipe out a county, just take their best cities so you become more powerful and they become useless)  From here your only real opponent can be China, Mongolia and Japan just lack the science to threaten you so good luck!  Oh and here are my favoured civics Government - Universal Suffrage Legal - Vassalage  Labour - Slavery Economy - State Property Religion - Free religion    Of course there will be some people who will explain not all the advice I'm giving is the best, but they're playing at a higher level and I've dominated the world by using these steps as a guideline plenty of times on difficulties higher than warlord. If you have any further questions please let me know! I love this game and will be more than happy to help you get started."

civ,3daqa3,Monkalrus,2,Wed Jul 15 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"No problem! This is a fairly easy strat, and if you can get your religion use a great prophet to build the unique building then you're pretty much set. Just as you go conquering remember to build courthouses fairly early to help with gold. Also I know I said to build a worker first every time you conquer a city, but this is mostly just early on. Other important details is that Rome will be generating gold like crazy, as soon as you can build Wallstreet in Rome and it'll double your gold output, normally by the time I'm able to build Wallstreet I'm struggling with gold but it fixes that problem quick. Same with State Property, really important you get this because you'll be constantly expanding your empire. If you do try this strat out let me know how it goes! I've been very successful with this while playing with friends so I hope it works for you"

If nothing else, it frees up your income for other things (like more janissaries!) 3. Sipahi's are good on paper. That's all I really have to say about them. I have a hard time loving UUs that don't keep their bonuses when they upgrade. Pillaging does mean more dosh for janissaries though."

However, they can also carry the early advantage to the later stages (of course it helps when you have a couple of ex-capitals at your disposal). The extra production from pastures doesn't stop being good, and in the late game fast razing is actually amazing when you just need to plow through swathes of AI land.  Also I find Celts really good for domination, as an effortless religion and additional happiness provide good support for invasions. Pictish warriors pack quite a punch with their foreign land bonus (that stays when upgraded, makes for great pikemen), even though an early melee unit won't be a that much of a game-changer as the premium UUs."

civ,3dbi98,uiucrower,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're useful. If you're playing tall and don't have a ton of strategic resources for building fighters/bombers/nukes, they can be helpful in a war. If you can build them quick enough (less than 3 turns) having a steady stream of missiles can help your war machine. The extra ranged attacks can help finish off enemy units that your other units could not take out. Guided missiles can make naval warfare better. Having a few missiles on hand can also help take out ships with low health and a single missile can usually take out an embarked unit. Like with carriers, you should take care to protect missile carrying ships since if they are sunk, you lose the missiles as well."

Enough melee units to tank the city's damage with a couple in reserve, rest in ranged(crossbows,arty, etc). With large scale invasions I'm not too sure but, I wouldn't take more than 2 cities at a time(you only need the capital to win remember). for defense- usually 4 or so ranged is enough, but if Attila or someone has #1 or #2 military and seems like he's getting too close Definitely beef it up, the AI can see your military strength and if it gets too low military civs will take advantage of it everytime."

civ,3d6iuh,IGGEL,6,Tue Jul 14 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"Whats going on with the German Western frontier? France and Belgium have had their borders shifted enormously east, resulting in an absurdly retracted German border. Your liege lies just about where Cologne is in real life and Verdun is very close to Frankfurt. Also, though this is silly for modern day borders, its even sillier for 1914 borders because Germany had recently captured Elsass-Lothringen, forcing the French Eastern borders further West than they'd been since Louis XIV. Equally, Switzerland has been pushed East, with Zurich lying about where modern day Tyrol sits. Just for reference so you can work it all out yourself, the little lake tile east of Belfort is lake Geneva, in Switzerland, and the river which your Verdun sits on is the Rhine, the current border between Germany and France. As you can see, your borders are rather out of whack.   The border between Germany and Austria was not a straight line, look at the modern day borders of the Czech republic, how they sort of force their way into Germany - all of the Czech republic was Austrian in 1914. The same is true of the borders between Russia and Germany - Russian Congress Poland should look like a bulge which seperates the German borders into two distinct tentacles like so. Mecca and Medina are too far north and Najran shouldn't be under Turkish control. Granada is too North, Moscow is too south, Aratat is not a city and if it were it'd lie several tiles west of your position near the actual Mt Aratat. Romania should hold Moldovia. Belfast is a weird choice when you don't have Dublin. Why Torino instead of Geneva or Milano? Both are larger and more important.   Whats up with unified Scandinavia? Sweden-Norway broke up ten years before the war and Denmark has never been under Swedish control. Very odd.   Finally, why are half your names in the local language and half in English?

As far as cities go, here are the some local names for all your cities:   Turin - Torino   Venice - Venezia  Gallipoli - Gelibolu  Constantinople - Kostantiniyye‎  Bagdhad - Bagdad  Mosul - Musul   Damascus - Sam  Beirut - Beyrut  Vienna - Wien  Budapest - Ofenpesth  Prague - Prag   Caporetto? - Karfreit  Belgrade - Beograd  Medina - Madinah  Mecca - Makkah  Also why is Finland independent? They de facto part of Russia by now."
civ,3d6iuh,TheDanx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the city names, I'm kinda kicking myself for forgetting Wien for Vienna. Of course I've heard of Milan, the exclusion is merely a misappropriation of city emphasis (which you yourself saw with Sardinia-Piedmont thing). Caporetto was included because of the Austrian offensive there when Brusilov came flying in from the north. It's named as Caporetto due to my overall lack of knowledge on the region combined with maps/campaign objectives in books. I will likely remove Cork and add Dublin. As for Sweden/Norway snowballing you called it 100% correct. A quick test last night proved as much. If I make them city states I am probably going to do the same to Spain and Portugal. Finland was made independent because I don't know how to script events to include them breaking off in 1917.  edit: The Finland thing did not extend to Ukraine due to its proximity to the front. If I can figure out scripting events I would like them both to break off."
civ,3d6iuh,JoshH21,0,Tue Jul 14 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"Finland was made independent in the same treaty which granted independence to Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Lativa, White Russia and ceded all of Poland to Germany. Making Finland independent only makes sense if you also make all of those territorial changes which are a little extreme. Indeed Finland was only able to get independence in the first place because of the Russian Revolution."

civ,3d6iuh,zgreen05,11,Tue Jul 14 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"I started making a Europe map that, in my opinion, would function a lot better. The just of it is, most maps have true north as the top of the map. I thought that by skewing the map slightly, one can cut down on a lot of the ocean, and at the same time give Scandinavia more space, give Russia a port near Murmansk, remove a lot of the useless snow and tundra of Russia, give a bit more room in Africa, and massively expand Egypt and the Arabian peninsula so that the you can go from the Persian Gulf to Suez. I was going to pick it up again, but I think that it would be great for the scenario you are building. If you want to use a custom map, I can make it and change things to better suit the gameplay.  I think most players will say they want to have the scenario be more freeform, loosely guided beginnings as long as the scenario will  eventually force people to war. Maybe making the AI more aggressive and expansive, but also more loyal and willing to declare friendship to encourage alliances. I know In annoyed when a scenario is too set; a big part of civ is replaying history, but when you follow that doctrine to the point of taking away the players choice and free will makes you commit historical folly. I like the idea of having Britain, Germany, and Russia having founded the ideologies at the start of the game, and the developing middle powers have to choose who to ally with."
civ,3d6iuh,quarianadmiral,9,Tue Jul 14 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome. I've begun to consider restarting from scratch anyways because I've only just begun to create the scenario and some of the editing today has made the map crash on startup.   99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, pass it around, 158 little bugs in the code  edit: I like the ideology idea a lot. I'm torn on how to set Britain's and France's ideologies though, as throughout the war the ""freedom"" aspect lost a lot of ground ""for the duration"". I also want to represent Britain's industrial strength as the longest industrialized nation, but post-October 1917 Russia really needs to be communist. I can't easily justify making all three Order, but certainly have reservations about ignoring the crucial policy changes on the Entente's home fronts. I'm still mulling this over in my head, though it'll probably end up being UK and France with freedom, and Russia with Order. Or UK/France order, and make Russia autocracy. I really haven't decided yet."
civ,3d6iuh,nikhow,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe you could do a sort of Rome in the Fall of Rome scenario. So with every social policy Russia gets worse until adopting all its special policies. Then it would undergo a "" Glorious Revolution"" which could spawn cheap units with moral boosts and turn the bad social polices into new better social policies that help Russia. Or force peace to allow the new Communist Russia to rebuild."

civ,3d6iuh,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be best to sacrifice the gameplay effects for being able to have 3 different idealogies and them all being relatively equal. For the idealogical countries, I would guess the game gets more interesting trying to force your opponents to change ideologies, as they're too close to you in strength to take head on. For the minor nations, It becomes a matter of trying to figure out which ideology will be most successful and best for you diplomatically, since alliances would be more important. Keep in mind there are also ways of giving the great powers good industrial bases without touching ideologies, tile improvements like manufactories can easily represent some of the factories in a country, and it makes it so you can actually take out important industrial sites with your units.  There are a lot of people suggesting a lot of complex ideas, like custom social policies. Once the map is done, it would be cool to see if we could get a modder to make a scenario out of it with custom rules. I think it would be cool to use bombers to pillage a tile, and it would make AA guns a lot more important."

If you do want some modifications, I suggest you increase the power of the machine guns. The Germans used the MG08, a version of the Maxim gun. This gun had a lot more power than the hand-cranked Gatling gun. It also had a larger effective range (but not maximum range) than common infantry rifles of the day. The German industry cranked into high gear and produced tons of these before WWI.  Basically, I think you should increase the Machine Gun range to 2 hexes, keep the power the same to compete with the Great War Infantry units, and make sure they are available at the start of the scenario. MGs on the front lines should be able to ""pin down"" the waves of infantry in the trenches.   If you want more info, check out The Gun by CJ Chivers."

İstanbul of article  Names of Istanbul:       The modern Turkish name İstanbul (pronounced [isˈtanbuɫ]) is attested (in a range of variants) since the 10th century, at first in Armenian and Arabic and then in Turkish sources. It derives from the Greek phrase ""εις την Πόλιν"" [istimbolin] or ""στην Πόλη"", both meaning ""in the city"" or ""to the city"";  a similar case is Stimboli, Crete. It is thus based on the common Greek usage of referring to Constantinople simply as The City (see above). The incorporation of parts of articles and other particles into Greek placenames was common even before the Ottoman period: Navarino for earlier Avarino,  Satines for Athines, etc.  Similar examples of modern Turkish placenames derived from Greek in this fashion are İzmit, earlier İznikmit, from Greek Nicomedia, İznik from Greek Nicaea ([iz nikea]), Samsun (s'Amison = ""se + Amisos""), and İstanköy for the Greek island Kos (from is tin Ko). The occurrence of the initial i- in these names may partly reflect the old Greek form with is-, or it may partly be an effect of secondary epenthesis, resulting from the phonotactic structure of Turkish, as in Turkish istasyon from French station.

civ,3db5jq,LegionOfTreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:10 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for under $800, but that may be wishful thinking.   Not as much as you might think. For a few generations now, CPUs have had on chip graphics. With the move to more mobile platforms, there's been an emphasis on more power with lower power consumption for heat and battery considerations.  If you go with one that has an Intel CPU, the model will have 4 numbers (i7-4770 for example). The first numeral in that set of 4 numbers is generation. The higher that number is, the more recent the tech it's built with is.  I think you might find this page handy:  http://www.ultrabookreview.com/5165-broadwell-ultrabooks/"

civ,3d921i,reality_is_a_bitch,6,Tue Jul 14 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, understand how Civ diplomacy works. Imagine a scale from -10 (fuck you) to 10 (hi ho neighbourino). At the begining of the game, you start at 0 and most things you do change your standing with each AI. If you do stuff that puts you at -10 from the get go (I assume that by ""crushing spain"" you mean a total kill), you have only yourself to blame.  What you try to do to correct yourself after being a thorn in everyones side is basically never enough. Diplomacy in civ is not a system that's so well done you can - there's no ""sorry, won't happen again"" button you can press. After denouciations, wars, city taking, spying and so on, the political landscape in a game is fucked forever.  There's a few hints for making friends in civ:  -Know when to be aggresive/passive. Most AIs will hate your guts as soon as you start a war. Some will tolerate you. No one is going to waste the opportunity to denouce you if you kill of a civ. If you can't handle being in a large scale conflict, don't start small skirmishes until you can.  -I don't recall the broken promise bug being fixed so FYI, if you break a promise (like not settling near someone after they asked you not to) EVERYONE will know, even civs you haven't met. And that's a huge diplo penalty for most of your game.  -If you happen to share a whole continent with a weak but annoying civ, you can completely kill them of without penalty as long as you didn't meet anyone else.  -Use common sense in managing relations. You could assume that someone without any religion in their cities would welcome yours as he at least could get SOME bonuses. That guy might like you for that specific thing. However, if you push religion on a guy who is already pushing theirs, you'll be hated."

I don't see that as problematic.  I couldn't even tell you how much time I've spent watching videos by Marbozir, FilthyRobot, quill18, and Acken. If I didn't understand tourism or how easy it is, I would spend that time to watch that video. It doesn't hurt my feelers if others feel the investment isn't worth it. It does leave me scratching my head that others feel the need to criticize the length (AND ONLY THE LENGTH) as if it refutes my claim.  It's called sour grapes.

After an amazing starting spot for Stockholm as a three-pronged canal, I tried to build my empire along the river routes. Around 0 AD I met Rome and began trading. Caesar attacks me at Uppsala and actually takes it before reinforcements can arrive. Reinforcement destroy army and began to push into Roman territory. Soon I come into contact with Zulu who are also invading Rome. Land grab happens and Rome is divided into the colonial possessions of Swedish Rome(Rome proper, Cumae, Attium, and Mediolanum) and Zulu Rome(Niapolis, Arretium, Ravenna). Zulu Army doesn't stop at Arretium and attacks Swedish Rome. After a good ten turns of shelling and maneuvering, the land forces are defeated and the Swedish navy, hardened from the Roman conquests and given enough time to heal is in position to move in on Ulundi. After a quick battle Ulundi is taken and renamed in honor of the great admiral which assisted in it's conquest(Turgut Reis). The Zulu sue for peace by giving control of the most profitable of the Zulu Roman cities(Niapolis) and the majority of their treasury. Not to be known as warmongers, Caesar is reinstated as head of the Second Roman Republic and given ground troops to wage a proxy war with the rest of Zulu Rome. Meanwhile, half of the Swedish navy is sent back up the river to Stockholm to establish hegemony over the river to the East, which holds the Empire's largest city of Helsinki on it's banks.

I may say that there's no need to make a game representing reality as much as possible. Game is a game, there are rules and there are simplifications which are inevitable in any game.

It would be cool to see some kind of city district system, where battles could be fought for only some of the districts, you could build different buildings and units in each district (giving big cities a big advantage over the small ones), etc.  The other idea I had were multi-tile rivers. Real life megarivers are often more than a kilometre across, and I really believe this should be represented in the game. It would give a really big defensive advantage to these big rivers, as the attackers would have to embark in order to cross the river. Also, ships could enter the in-lands this way, possibly giving fire support during wars. There would also have to be a way of building bridges over these rivers, so as not to cut your empire in half."

I'm pretty sure you can do it with custom maps, but to have a randomly generated map where you can cross the poles would be a lot of fun. The one problem I see is that it might be a bit confusing. Because maps are sliced along a north/south line and rolled out east/west, you can cross that line and will come out at the same position on the opposite side of the map. However if you try crossing the top of the map, you won't end up at the bottom but somewhere else at the top."

I've met people, older people (40s-50s) that are NOT gamers... but they play the hell out of some Civilization when they can.  Its the perfect ""Dad/granddad game"".  Why?   Its got History.  Both in its theme as well as being a long enough running series that some have grown up playing the older ones as well. Turn based means absolutely no reflexes required.  Just pure strategy and decision making.  Also you can get up & take care of shit right in the middle w/o pausing and whatnot.  I can tell you as I get older, I appreciate turn based games more & more. Games can last as long as you want.  You can run a single long game forever and just chip away at it like a long-running soap opera of strategy, diplomacy & deceit.  Or do a quick duel map battle for funsies. Infinitely replayable.  If you're gonna play one game, its probably gonna be something with this as its chief selling point. YOU GET TO NUKE SHIT.   Anyways, its just a theory, but I bet ya, at least... I don't know.. a good 25% of those numbers, is these types of people.  And that's fucking awesome.    What makes me think this is the case, is the popularity of other 4X games.. are not so much.  They're niche, but are catering to a more Gamer niche.  Granted there are probably dad gamers that are into SPACE so they got Master of Orion II & GalCiv II permanently installed I don't know.

civ,3d251l,wlievens,20,Mon Jul 13 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"Same here! Civ has been such a weirdly important part of my little life!  Civ 1: I was too young to play on my own, but I watched my dad play all the time in his home office.  Civ 2: I definitely remember writing a book report in grade 4 and trying to use the civilopedia in Civ 2 as a way to fabricate a story. Did not work. I played this game way too much. Convinced some friends to play. They go bonkers over the idea nuking your best friend. Me, my dad, and my little bro put hundreds of hot seat hours sitting around a computer playing together. My dad taught us a lot about the game but also about history. It kicked ass!  [The interlude years of Call to Power] - I feel dirty but I loved those games too. I felt CtP1 was a huge leap from before. Loved the music and the fact there were a million civs to choose from. Very audacious. I was still young though, so I dont know what I'd think of it today.  Civ3: got confused when I brought my crush over to hang out and I boot up a new civ game for us to play. Convinced my superior skills as a world conqueror will clinch this girl. Instead, I rush through everything before she can even begin reading the pop ups (I had them memorized). She didnt come over a second time. What a noob, right?   Civ4: Watched my dad pull the same thing I did in civ3. A new date comes over for a third time and she says in passing she thinks the idea of this civ game is neat. 5 minutes later this poor woman is sitting around a computer with me and my dad giving her intense strategy run downs and clicking past pop ups. Strangely, she sticks around and has been my step mum for more than a decade and a half. Also, Civ4 for me was the pinnacle of civ complexity and achievement. I loved it.  Civ5: I admit I was such a purist about civ by this point that hex tiles offended me! But after one play through I loved it. I also like one unit per tile. No stacks of doom! But holy fuck did diplomacy ruin the game. It was nonsensical for a good long while. Now I love civ5 after the two expansions. Such an amazing game. Now that me and my bro are all grown up, done college, and into our careers, the two of us still play a MP game via steam with my dad every couple weeks.  Civ console games: we do not speak of these abominations. They are not civ. When you go almost your whole life with civ, I see shit like revolutions as watered down so cartoonishly that it just seemed almost like a mockery and cash grab sell out.   Don't really know where I was going with this. It is just both weird and cool to think about something that has contributed so significantly to my life and my relationship with my dad and bro. Hell, I'm even an archaeologist... I know civ had a part in this. PS. I love that archaeologists are in civ5 as the unit unlocked after universities... so cool!"

While Crusader Kings may be more fun for those who can play it, you need to devote a solid entire afternoon to learning it. With Civ, it literally guides you as you play.  You won't learn meta-game stuff, and you'll be a massive wonder whore, but you'll know how to play.   Same with Counter-Strike/Halo, or Spore/Kerbal. Hell, you can pour DAYS into Kerbal and have no idea what you're doing."

While Civ and CKII are very different games themselves; the way you learn the game, for me, felt very similair. It was a lot of trial and error at first, the game will kick your ass a bunch, but then you'll start to learn how to survive. Once that happens, the game gets much easier. It'll feel daunting at first since there appears to be a lot of buttons and a million different things you can do, but you'll learn that a lot of it is situational and you are really just trying to keep every one happy, maintain the status quo. Oh! Also very important: have sex with your sisters."

civ,3d251l,Toukai,8,Mon Jul 13 04:39:33 2015 UTC,Castile isn't hard to figure out either.
civ,3d251l,Jucoy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think Castille, while an excellent starter choice, is a bit harsher than Irish duchies. There's more players involved in the Iberian peninsula, and they're generally a lot bigger than those involved in Ireland. Plus you have to worry about people of a different religion, no matter who you play modern-day Spain."
civ,3d251l,elcarath,8,Tue Jul 14 06:11:27 2015 UTC,"I second this. Most importantly stay away from the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantium, Normandy... really any area with big historical events happening at that time in history. Events may not go according to history but often the sparks that caused them will go off. For instance William the Conqueror will almost always invade England, but he won't always succeed. Being caught up in one of those big historical events can be overwhelming for a new player though."

It's just that every time I try I just get decision swamped--there just doesn't appear to be a flow you get into turn by turn--because it isn't turn based per say. The interface is so clunky I never know what to look for or what is good or how to know I will win a battle. :/ so I inevitably boot up something with slower barrier of entry.

civ,3d251l,orsonames,7,Mon Jul 13 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Here's what my take on it. I've put tons of hours into Paradox games, and I never really learned per se, but rather, the concept just snapped with me. With every Paradox game I picked up I learned it faster and faster. CK2 took me about 10 hours of gameplay before I kind of realized what I needed to be able to enjoy and play it. Afterwards it only took 4 hours for EU4, and then it only took 2 hours for Vicky 2.  Here's what you're gonna need for CK2, you're gonna need patience and a realization that it's not complex. I have my theory on why people think the games are complex when their not, and that's because the UI is intimidating (I mean, it's literally the entire screen).  See, the reason CK2 is not complex is because hovering over everything provides a tool tip which explains it, so that gets any counter-intuitiveness out of the way. Along with that you need patience, because you need to understand that when you're a count, there's not much to do besides attempt to get more land. So that's another thing you need to understand; the reward. You need to understand that for every single thing that you notice, understand, and wait for, you are rewarded in some way. Whether it be by getting a claim on a title, or just understanding a game mechanic, you just need patience. Unless you're like a king, in which case you have more things to do, and that's a reward for having waited patiently as a count."
civ,3d251l,Figusirow,4,Mon Jul 13 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"I think they could streamline that interface, and it would be a lot easier to play.  I have like 200 hours clocked on CK2, and I still dont like putting armies into navies."

civ,3d251l,hacksilver,2,Mon Jul 13 08:58:08 2015 UTC,It's still easier to move massive groups than CiV though. When I'm doing doom-stack wars I can get my armies from all across my realm to one place with relative ease compared to CiV.
civ,3d251l,orsonames,2,Mon Jul 13 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Never played CK2 but Europa Universalis IV's my thing and I was able to pick it up in a weekend.   Granted, I still don't know what I'm doing, but I get the ""flow"".  Once you consider each Year as a Turn in a standard TBS game it all makes sense.  Make big decisions Jan 1 and then just sorta ride the year out til you get paid next year.  The rest of the year's all about dealing with events or waiting for armies to move around."
civ,3d251l,exiledheretic,2,Mon Jul 13 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"CK2 isn't really that bad to learn, there's a lot of shit that you can pretty much disregard and still enjoy the game.  I learned it by following along with a ""let's play"" until I understood what I was doing enough to try things on my own.  With a lot of save scumming I was able to conquer most of Europe in my first game.  You can also watch people play to learn from them, I think Quill18 is probably best for tutorial videos on youtube."
civ,3d251l,DevinTheGrand,2,Mon Jul 13 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it took me about 2 hours to understand the basics, playing in Ireland as per the tutorial on the CKII sub. After that I could do shit. It took about another 20 hours to actually be basically competent and now, about 75 in, I have a decent grip on everything. It's one of those games where you will learn as you go along, and enjoy doing so, if you're willing to put in those first 2 hours of bafflement."
civ,3d251l,ssubtle,2,Mon Jul 13 07:16:18 2015 UTC,An afternoon of learning lets you survive a year in game.
civ,3d251l,LevynX,2,Mon Jul 13 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly CK2 is not as tough as people think, and there are a few good video tutorials out there. It's mostly about learning the base mechanics and then deciding how you want to have fun with them as it's much more of a sandbox than Civ. So perhaps what puts people off is that learning it is easy, but the game doesn't tell you how to have fun - there's no way to win, no objective, and that can feel slow, especially as many of the starts recommended for beginners are designed to be extra-slow to ease you into things.  Arumba has a good tutorial series on youtube where he plays as a county in Ireland. If you want to get into it, I recommend playing along with that (to the extent that RNG will allow, anyway) until you feel comfortable with mechanics. If you have any kind of background knowledge of the historical period, that helps but is not necessary.  I think the biggest things to grasp that makes it different from Civ are that firstly, you're playing a dynasty. You're not playing as the Nation of England or whatever, you're playing as House Plantagenet  or whatever. You only control one person at any given time, who may well be King of England, but when that character dies you continue as your heir. It's about building up the strength of your family, and that will sometimes mean you end up going from playing the King of England to the bastard half-brother who owns an island off the coast of Scotland while your Uncle rules as king. That's not a step backwards.  I'm rambling because I haven't had the time to play in a while and I want to. Have a look at /r/crusaderkings if you need help or advice - they're usually friendly."
civ,3d251l,Pthaos,2,Mon Jul 13 09:27:46 2015 UTC,"Watch some let's plays. Arumba is fantastic. It's situational monkey see monkey do. CKII is a game that really does let you have nearly unlimited agency on the world around you. It's learning what to do and when that takes awhile to do, because there's a lot of UI to get through. But once you know what to look for and where to look for it information wise, the game just clicks and you can do anything.   I played Civ religiously for quite some time, but once CK2 clicked, it's hard to go back. Still both amazing though obviously."
civ,3d251l,AtlasRodeo,2,Mon Jul 13 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"Play for three or four hours, starting at the 1066 start, in Ireland (noob island). You'll get the basics. I'm in around 900 or so hours, and I always feel there is still things to be learned.  Visit  /r/incestsimulator /r/crusaderkings, usually helpful people are around."

civ,3d251l,Paz436,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"It's not an outright bad game and I have nothing against the principle of having a chain of command. However, for me, the way they implemented it is clunky and requires extreme micromanagement to work properly - not sure it works in a Grand strategy game where you've already got a ton of other stuff to think about.   If I want an OOB with extreme depth and micromanaging everything down to company level, I'll play War in the East or another operational-level wargame. It works there because the political, production, supply chain and resource management side of things is abstracted rather than HOI3 which gives you a level of control over all these factors. In WiTE you don't have the ability to decide occupation strategy or anything like that, but it does what it does very well.  I think a grand strategy game needs to limit the complexity in certain areas in order to be a fun experience - Paradox did that to some degree, but they sold short the political and economic system, as well as the possibility for alternate history (it was far more railroaded than HOI2 and its iterations) and we're left with an end product that doesn't wargame as well as operational level wargames, and doesn't give the same amount of freedom as its predecessor. So I and a reasonable number of others gave up on it and went back to other alternatives."

civ,3d251l,Goatkin,5,Mon Jul 13 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"Wonder whoring in the sense of GET ALL THE WONDERS isn't a great strategy cause many wonders are pretty mediocre and simply not worth the extra hammers and turns you'd spend on building it. You'd be better off building something else (units, other buildings, etc).  Some wonders are absolutely great and you should get them if you can and if it fits your situation/victory type (e.g. Hubble Space Telescope for a science victory). But these are typically in the minority.  If you won a game which you wonder whored, you probably would have won it even quicker if you didn't wonder whore."

civ,3d251l,Meshkent,13,Mon Jul 13 01:47:56 2015 UTC,"DLC's are on sale very often, with every major Steam sale and oftentimes during the weekend or daily deal as well. Shouldn't take too hard to find on a third party site too.  Generally the complete edition goes for $12.50 and you might as well just get that since it is cheaper than getting all the DLC and little content packs piecemeal.  And yes, the DLC's are more than worth it. Civ 5 CE is a very different game from its vanilla brother."

If you do not have a functioning army (or better yet, already won the game), Shaka WILL come to be your bunk mate and you are not going to have a good time.  Also, tourism doesn't really do anything for the AIs unwillingness to attack you. AIs even sometimes gang up on people who seem close to achieving a victory type.  Best solution for your predicament is getting nukes IMO. However, you could try the whole behind-the-scenes machiavellian proxy war strat (paying people to go to war with eachother, wiping armies/cities in positions favourable to your situation, dividing and conquering).  Have you considered using nukes and praying?"

civ,3d5stf,xSnarf,4,Mon Jul 13 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"If you can, you could create your own Xcom army and create something of a MAD scenario (Mutually Assured Destruction). So even if he declares war on you, just Xcom into his turf and either take his cities or force him to stop his invasion and defend his lands.  I've found the AI can be sporadic in its defense. Sometimes it says, ""IDGAF"" and continues its invasion, others it pulls back the invasion and attempts a defense. It's a crap shoot."
civ,3d5stf,Drak_is_Right,3,Mon Jul 13 21:03:57 2015 UTC,"Shaka is staying out of the fight right now.  So, I am in the middle of finishing off Napoleon.  First I nuke his cities, then I bomb the shit out of them, then I drop two XCOM units.  He usually kills one XCOM unit next to his bombed city on his turn so I can bomb it a few more times then take it.  He will usually take it back.  We do that a few times until he begins to run out of bozookas and Marines.  Then I can hold it and move on.  I buy more Nukes and XCOM units with the cash from the kills.  Napoleon doesn't seem to have any nuclear material either.  Since he has not retaliated with Nukes yet, (I destroyed the nukes he had in my initial raid)."
civ,3d5stf,rabbitlion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"Word, another strategy could be to place a rocket artillery and several stealth bombers with the bonus against land units in your cities that are within range of invasion.  It's not cheap, but if he drops Xcoms near your cities you can kill them/knock them into the red before they are able to take anything."
civ,3d5stf,xaxers,3,Mon Jul 13 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Xcoms can't drop on units, so you can usually just surround your cities with workers or something."

civ,3d5stf,dream_in_blue,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:07 2015 UTC,3-6 units around critical cities.  lots of bombers in those cities.
civ,3d5stf,Doctor_Red,2,Tue Jul 14 03:17:21 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of ways:   Prevent him from dropping them on you. X-Coms require vision to drop. Spies give vision around a city, but if you place units in all the 6 hexes surrounding a city X-Coms can no longer be dropped. This needs to be combined with keeping a wide perimeter around your empire so that he cannot see into it. Build as many Stealth Bombers as you have aluminium and as many Bombers as you have oil, and use these to kill the X-Coms. Airplanes are the natural counter to X-Coms, though if you are being severely outproduced it might not be enough to tip the balance in your favor. Don't declare war until you can nuke the majority of his cities and units in the same turn."
civ,3d5stf,JackTheOnion,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"Shaka has a gazillion on the damn things. As soon as I declare war I am inundated with them.   You fucked up.  Your best options are as follows:  Nuke the shit out of the land holding them.  Turn it to glass.  That will kill them off.  But, you know, lots of uranium.  Lots of bombers/stealth bombers with the land unit attack promotions.  Doable, but still requires tons of units and tons of oil/aluminum.  Jillions of your own units.  Can't drop where there are no open tiles, and fortress/citadel up, and use ranged units to hammer them as they drop.  Pay him to declare war on someone else, get them to foreign lands then stab his ass in the back."

civ,3d8jlj,Pocket_Hercules,3,Tue Jul 14 09:57:35 2015 UTC,"Appeal to authority aside, FilthyRobot recommends having about 2.5 more cities when going wide over going tall. Assuming 3-5 cities when going Tradition, going Liberty you'd want 8-12 cities minimum. It depends on a lot of variables, but I used to shoot for about 10.  If you are fairly new to civ, I recommend getting used to the game's evolution through the eras by playing Tradition/tall first. I made the mistake of falling in love with Liberty too soon in my own personal Civ evolution. I got into some bad habits as a result."

civ,3d8jlj,DrCron,2,Tue Jul 14 11:07:47 2015 UTC,"Some victory types are more suited to tall. You can in theory win any type in tall, but early on you will have less gold, possibly injuring Diplo, more science cost, however more cities to produce science, you will most likely be behind though. Culture win is by far the hardest wide, even if you do the Autocracy Great Person thing due to higher culture costs. And then there's Democracy. In SP, you want to use the early stuff you get to snowball yourself into decent lands and a chance kategame against Tradition, which is achieved by getting tons of cities.  Tl;dr yes, it depends on the map though"

civ,3d5chn,Kenraali,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I tend to name my early units immediately on training.  I assume it's the EUI that allows me to do so.  My convention is:    YY XXX UnitType  where YY is the turn number divided by 10, XXX is an abbreviation of the city where they were trained and UnitType is their original type (abbreviated if necessary).  So 13 PAR Bowman would be originally a composite bowman, trained in Paris, around turn 130.  I don't continue naming through the whole game, but enjoy keeping an eye on some of my early units, especially my original warrior.    In my current game, my original warrior met an undignified end around turn 350 (epic pace).  I was short of cash and it was a couple of upgrades from being current, so had been relegated to the edge of an ongoing war.  And... it got disbanded due to my deficit.  I still don't know how that mechanism works - it seems to be a dice roll as to whether you'll have a unit disbanded - but this time it happened and it was my original warrior that was the victim."

Or maybe you build a work boat, then the workers can enter into that and improve water tiles by investing some turns into them?  The crazy part is that in terms of Fish tiles, you get more benefit from a Lighthouse, which benefits ALL of your ocean/fish/resource tiles. I think all of this could've been balanced better."
civ,3d67sp,DushkuHS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well, a worker might take you 8 turns to produce in the early game on Standard, while a work boat takes you 5 turns. After the worker comes out, it probably takes a couple turns to get to the tile you want to improve, then maybe 6 more turns to create the improvement. That's 8 + 2 + 6 = 16 turns to get your improvement.  A 5-turn work boat has more movement, so you get to the tile you want to improve quickly, and it improves the tile right away. Maybe 5 to 7 turns total.  Workers are still way better, and work boats still seem overpriced for only using them once, but the speed you get to improve the tile helps to offset that a little more."

Our latencies also usually stay below 100 ms while three of us usually stay below 40 ms. We have been basically unable to get a game going due to weird delays, reloads/resyncs, random lock-ups and several sorts of weird lags when passing turns or issuing orders as you described.  We have no idea what causes this. We are trying several different ways of playing the game (with/without dedicated pitboss server, with/without simultaneous turns, etc) but so far all of them end up unplayable due to bugs eventually. We haven't been able to get a single game further than 250 turns so far (always epic speed).  This seems to be a common issue with Civ5 unfortunately. If you look at the relatively recent steam hub Civ5 multiplayer patch thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/8930/discussions/0/626329186876953469/ You can see in the replies there that this is a long known problem for apparently a lot of people and it hasn't been completely solved so far, but it definitely seems to be better nowadays than when the game launched.

Alternate prod/culture buildings 2. Build growth buildings 3. then enjoy!  If small city.  1. Alternate building prod/growth while improving happiness tiles. 2. Build culture buildings. 3. contemplate burning it to the ground every other turn.

civ,3d585r,Sleeping_Fish,5,Mon Jul 13 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Tradition and domination is my usual strategy.  Make sure the cities are far enough apart that they have room to grow and that different cities specialize different ways (like my capitol is science/culture, my second or third city - whichever has better horses/iron (and production) usually produces military units), a third city science/culture/ a few units, while the fourth is more support and might do a bit of science along with trade and worker units.  One key is make sure the city has enough improved tiles for its size.  ALWAYS ALWAYS make sure every tile being worked is improved.  AN example of a second city which is a military complex:  no trade depots, only food, lumbermills, or mines.  Only great tile improvement is manufacturies.  Starts out with granary, stables, iron building, barracks, watermill, lighthouse, workshop, and monument.  maximizing city growth and production.  it will churn out probably 50% of the units you use during the game.  if a building doesn't give food, production, or unit xp, no need to build it unless the city has downtime (or need a national wonder).  all captured cities should be razed or puppeted.  only time you annex a captured city is if it has wonders, good food , and good production all 3.  given I don't like to rebuild enemy empires (and suffer the culture penalty for a lot of cities) I tend to only raze the very worst placed enemy cities."
civ,3d585r,Drak_is_Right,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:55 2015 UTC,So you still typically stick with your 4/5 core cities and puppet the captured ones? When I've tried this before I would annex the captured cities and as a result my culture would struggle in the late game. Not really sure why I just don't like having puppet cities haha. I understand it's to prevent these culture and science penalties but they just don't feel like MY cities
civ,3d585r,Drak_is_Right,2,Mon Jul 13 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"a few of the captured ones I will annex, but not many.  I'd say 1 in every 10-20 I'd annex.  If a continents map, will have 1 city on each major continent annexed.  I'd say on average I annex about 2 cities for every 3 civs i conquer.  On harder difficulties and more crowded maps I would annex more if I never founded more then 2 cities (had one game on immortal where I ended up getting forward settled.  I ended up settling 0 cities for a domination victory)."
civ,3d585r,darthreuental,2,Mon Jul 13 20:22:26 2015 UTC,Only annex a city if you can afford to rush a courthouse and after the riots end. You can puppet a city upon conquest and annex it later after things calm down. Otherwise you get extra unhappiness for nothing.

Block Connections- Land units can only block connections by pillaging roads/railroads (tiles with improvements must be pillaged twice. First for improvement. Second for the road).

Block Connections- Naval and Embarked units block connection only if they are within two tiles/firing range if a city.

civ,3d3mbv,dudemcbob,21,Mon Jul 13 12:50:58 2015 UTC,"The ""military strength"" stat in the demographics is what you should keep an eye on. That's what the AI uses for its war decisions.  When I have peaceful neighbors who are neutral towards me, I can usually avoid war by maintaining around half of their military strength (also on King, idk if this varies by difficulty). If my neighbors are warmongers and/or pissed at me, and I want to avoid war, I usually try to keep close to matching their military strength.  Keep in mind that military strength is not just a count of your units; it also accounts for how strong the units are. So, if you have a tech lead then you should be able to manage a high military stength with just a handful of units. It also accounts for your treasury (since you could spend that on an army in the case of war). So, if you stockpile gold and then spend a bunch in one turn on non-military stuff, be prepared for a spike in your military strength stat."

It seems they don't quite work as well with it as Janissaries do, which can usually kill units in 2 attacks and heal up any damage they have taken.   I considered siege for assisting artillery fire for quicker city capture but again the above problem persists, Caroleans commit too much to attacking cities to be able to heal up after even with medic Hakkapeliitas supporting them.   Is it best to just take 2 levels of shock or drill and one level of cover? So they can just create a meatwall, just killing units without being too prone to enemy ranged and city attacks? Even 2 levels of cover maybe and get the rest of shock or drill in combat?"
civ,3d3mbv,lax_br0,11,Mon Jul 13 16:54:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my dissertation on civ V melee strategy in generally rough terrain:  blitz is overrated on anything other than very mobile units.  Tanks are good with blitz because they can hit twice then GTFO before the other civ retaliates.  with caroleans you're better off with cover I and II (these are by far the most important for infantry units) and then probably woodsman (double movement thru forest and jungle) which synergizes well with your march promotion.  Siege again is not ideal, as cities are much too strong in civ 5 to attack with infantry units (unless you have a shit-ton of them to burn).    I would advise:  Drill I  Cover I  Cover II  Drill II  Drill III  Woodsman (or whatever double forest movement is called)  Make sure to keep them on hills or in forests.  If terrain is overwhelmingly flat, go shock instead.  With double woods movement and +45% woods promotions, +66% ranged defense, and +25% rough terrain, and +10 heal (or more with medics nearby) your caroleans are unstoppable at roughly the combat strength of modern infantry or great war infantry when they're in the forests.  Ignore blitz and siege, you'll be turtling with them more than attacking.  Attack the city once so your health isnt 100, that way the city will go after your caroleans instead of cannon/artillery.  Then fortify and tank shot after shot.  You will be doing 90% of the city damage with ranged units."

Re-installed the game on Steam and started two different games -- both of which I gave up at varying points. Played as a new Civ (to me), Denmark. One map I was landlocked and in a war against all four of my neighbours (including Attilla). In the second game on Ring (so I could use Denmark's UA) I made it until about 1950. Was going for a science victory but being constantly slowed down by wars and later rebellions (since the AI insists on outlawing every goddamn luxury resource).  I've been playing on King, which I used to win maybe 75% of the time.  Why are the AI all targeting me for wars? Seems like there are very few AI-AI wars but I'm constantly being harrassed by 2-3 civs at once. I know I'm keeping small armies in peace-time, which is a problem, but what little peace time I get I try to use to build science buildings and grow my city populations. Money wasn't an issue in my last game, but happiness and continued wars were.  Things I might have done: I did attack and capture two cities from another civilization after lying about troop movements.

Also yes breaking the promise to not attack is a very big pentalty in terms of diplomacy, you shouldn't do it unless it is your only chance to get into the game, declare war if they ask you that since you are probably close enough anyway.  Also as Denmark is underpowered if you don't make use of their embarkment, you should get some berserkers, 3-4 catapults and go for coastal cities, you can embark from sea and attack with everything you got on same turn, usually taking cities at that turn or at the very worst take it next turn without much retaliation.

civ,3d3mbv,lucidzero,4,Mon Jul 13 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"I've been playing on King now for awhile, and suddenly I'm getting my ass handed to me. I don't know what happened, as I was winning before this started happening on King.  Basically, I'm usually on a Continents map. Suddenly, the two civs surrounding me will declare war. In 2 of 3 games I've been able to fight them off and win. The 3rd I lost because I didn't know Carthage's elephants were melee and consequently she took one of my cities (I had 2, along with some of Babylon's who I was already at war with) so I just quit.  Something I have been doing is declaring war on an AI when I see their settler moving towards an area I want to settle. I take the settlers as a worker, then declare peace once I can. I'm thinking perhaps this is making the AI more aggressive? It's not even the civ I do this to though, usually the other civs that decide to come at me after the war has been over for a long time and all I did was take a settler.  Additionally, I've continue to run into problems with founding cities. I'm lucky if I can even get up a second city. Usually any good spots are taken by the city-states, and if not they are so close to another civ that they would declare war and take the city from me, or they've already settled it on me, or way too close and have eaten up some of the luxuries that I desperately need. Most games I can only get my capitol and maybe one other city up. I end up just puppeting whatever I conquer after that, and I rarely annex because the cities I do that to always seem to be a bit useless.  And finally, why does Rome suck so bad? I just played a game as them, and I assumed the UA would pay off nicely in a wide empire, but it basically shaved a turn off a building's production. It's nice, but honestly doesn't do that much to help you win, especially when you're at war with Russia and England (who's also at war with Russia) & Morocco decide to go to war with you as well. If the AI wasn't so dumb, Morocco could have taken one of my cities."
civ,3d3mbv,D4rkd3str0yer,7,Tue Jul 14 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"I think I can help with the first three.   It might be because you have a small army. How many units do you usually build? If you're last in demographics, the AIs will take advantage and DOW you. Build at least some Comp Bowmen early on and a few melee and siege units later. Make sure you have at least some sort of army otherwise like I said the AI (especially your neighbors) will take advantage. This is your warmonger penalty. Every time you declare a war, whether you take a city or not, you get warmonger points. While some civs are more forgiving than others regarding warmonger points, it's generally not a good idea to declare a lot of wars unless you're warmongering and are powerful enough to ignore opinions of other weaker civs. I would rarely declare war to take a settler unless it's very early in the game, taking the settler would ensure that I got a prime city spot (even then you can try and park some units on the best spots as it will prevent the AI from settling there), or I was going to declare war anyways and taking the settler would be such a significant setback to my opponent that I would be willing to rush my war effort to take it. You don't always need 100% optimal spots. Settling cities is extremely important, so definitely take suboptimal spots if you need your second or third city. If you take screenshots of your situation, people on the sub are generally very helpful and can help you learn city placement in spots that generally are not considered optimal. I have only played Rome once, so take this with a grain of salt, but from what I understand the focus of Rome should be the two UUs. They both are excellent for early warmongering which is what Rome is mostly built for."
civ,3d3mbv,lucidzero,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks. I do have enough army, at least most of the time. It often happens actually before I'm about to go to war with my enemy, but my units aren't on anyone's borders either. The problem is that my units are kind of out of place a lot of the time. Like against Carthage, Bablyon had declared war on me, so as I was dealing with him, I hadn't had time or the forces to spare to send them over to deal with Carthage on the other side of my empire."

civ,3d3mbv,Furkhail,6,Wed Jul 15 08:37:47 2015 UTC,"That would be because of terrain features. If you are in a flatland (no hills) you can't range attack through hills, forest or jungles without the ""indirect fire"" promotion. So try placing your ranged unit on hills, that way they can pretty much fire everything they see in their range limit. Be aware that artillery units already have the ""indirect fire"" promotion as well as the naval units Destroyer and Battleship (and all the upgrades of those units)."
civ,3d3mbv,PRANK_PATROL,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:22:46 2015 UTC,They only can fire against what they can see and is in range.  You can see what is in the same level or below and not behind a same level forest/jungle (i.e you can see a tile behind a forest if you are in a hill). Besides you always can see what is adjacent to you.  The levels of altitude are as follow from top to bottom: Mountains - Hills - Everything else.  This means that sea or marsh is at the same level as grassland/plains  All of this taking Indirect Fire into consideration ofc. It ignores everything about visibility.

If you are exploring and don't exactly know where the enemy is, then move your units one hex at a time. Might sound obvious but sometimes I'll still be so eager to explore or grab that ancient ruin, that I'll just blindly move a unit the full distance with no vision, only to run into a couple of barbarians and lose the unit next turn!"

civ,3d3mbv,actually_ixex,4,Wed Jul 15 12:19:16 2015 UTC,Is there a way to choose which tile my borders will expand to next? Or is it decided by the game only?
civ,3d3mbv,Elmonotheczar,3,Wed Jul 15 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"The only way to sure-fire pick is to buy the tiles directly. Take note of the varying costs to buy tiles though. The factors which determine cost-to-buy are the same as the factors which determine where the city will expand next. (It will pick the cheapest available option, breaking ties at random.)  So how are the prices determined? You have a base price to buy a tile, which starts at 50g (on standard speed) and increases by 5g every time you buy a tile. This price is used for the highest priority tile that each city can buy; in case of ties, they all get this price. Lower priority tiles will be more expensive--I'm still not entirely clear on the details here, to be honest. Take a look at this example I cooked up: http://imgur.com/Gz6Z7dS You'll notice that rough terrain gets a huge priority penalty, that hexes with resources on them tend to be higher priority, and that desert is lower priority than other flatland. The big three to watch out for are the rough terrain vs flat terrain priority (flat wins every time), the presence of resources (significantly higher priority), and the number of in-border hexes required to get from your city to the prospective tile (more hexes away = lower priority)."

civ,3d3mbv,D4rkd3str0yer,8,Mon Jul 13 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"science:  let me explain the metagame for the first 100 turns.  You want 4 cities up and running with libraries in all of them and a national college in your capital by around turn 100 on standard.  This takes practice to master but it is crucial to keeping a good science game.  Build order will look something like this:  Scout  Scout 2 (if map is standard pangaea or large+ continents.  otherwise map is too small to need 2 scouts)  Monument  Shrine  Settler  Steal worker from city state  Archer if theres a big bad warmonger near you  Settler 2 (or worker if you couldn't steal one)  Granary (if you have 1 or more of deer banana wheat in your capital, if not, build an archer)  Worker 2  Settler 3  Library  ...  ...  National College  I usually buy my library in the last city i found the second i found it.  In your second and third city, build a library first followed by a worker.  In your fourth city, buy the library instantly and build worker or granary first.  You should be able to start the National college the second you found your fourth city if you save the 400 gold for it.  This is about the time you'll be finishing the tradition policy tree as well (always go tradition untill you become really experienced with the game to know when to go liberty).    Get the techs you need for luxuries and defense, rush civil service, then rush education and build universities ASAP.  As soon as you finish a university, force lock the 2 science specialist slots (assign 2 population in your university if you have the food to put them there).  They will make great scientists for you and get you more science.  If you get your NC up by turn 100 and get universities quickly after that and fill them with science specialists, you should be good for science.  After this, prioritize public schools and research labs, but remember to keep a military going as well.  Go rationalism 100% of the time all the time.  Never pass up rationalism opener and Secularism policy (+2 for specialists)  EDIT: as for korea, do the same thing, but make sure you pick freedom and work tons of specialist slots.

This has happened very often in my games, and I often find myself having trouble with happiness and ideology pressure. In addition, my culture often sucks being as low as 13 culture per turn by the time I pick my ideology.  So I have a few questions:   When should I build my guilds? How can I improve my culture output? What is the best way to prevent ideology pressure from cultural runaways? What's the best way to put ideology pressure onto cultural runaways?

You should build your guilds in your highest or what will be your highest pop city that has FRESH WATER when you have the free production time. Gardens are important for Great People Generation which you'll need. There are several ways to increase tourism output. Remember that your tourism doesn't start building up on them until you discover them so scout well. Researching techs in the best way to multiply your tourism. It'll allow you to get a head start on cultural wonders, airports, hotels, and the Internet are key and will significantly increase your pressure  Theming is putting the correct types of Great Works into a building. Mouse over the +(Insert Number here to find out what that building wants). Next are the modifiers. If you're fine with them knowing where your Capital is then give them an embassy and open borders. Trading with a Civ also increases your percent modifier. Don't worry about the shared religion. If it happens it happens and that's all there is to that. Next is the Aesthetics Policy Tree. The opener is great. And the closer and cultural exchange are what makes the Policy Tree if you do decide to go for it. To prevent ideological pressure you have to have the same cultural impact on them are they have on you. If you're exotic to them but familiar with them and you both have an ideology then they'll pressure you. So either generate more culture or more tourism. Though they kind of go hand in hand. The best way to put pressure in them is with burst tourism from a Great Musician or World Ideology. Get those without an ideology yet to vote for yours and you should be Gucci.   Hopefully with this you'll get them to listen to your blue jeans and wear your pop music!"

civ,3d3mbv,Dagobah_Kush,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Okay. It's been a few days, sorry about that.  If you're dying to a military push around Renaissance, I assume it's Musketmen. While Musketmen are an upgrade, they're not a whole lot stronger than Longswordsmen; the Combat rating goes from 21 to 24. This means that while they are less effective, if you've build Crossbowmen you should still be able to kill the advance. This assumes that you've built Crossbowmen. If you've been building melee units as your main defense, you're going to have more of an issue. For more on combat, I already wrote this reply. The entire post isn't completely relevant, but the bit in the middle goes over the advantages of ranged units versus melee units.  Avoiding World Wonders entirely may be seen as a mistake, but I hold that it's better to avoid them all than keep getting beat to them. If you're thinking about building a World Wonder, check to see if you're relatively close to the first to research the tech. For example, if you're the first to Physics, it's a lot safer to go for Notre Dame.  When I was asking about priorities, I was referring to Gold, Science, Culture, Army, Production, Faith, etc. rather than Victory conditions. If you're going for Science Victories, hopefully you're not getting beat to Renaissance too badly.  As for the Dutch, try to capitalize on their Unique traits. Their UA means you can trade away your last copy of a Luxury Resource without losing a ton of Happiness, so decide if you need that +2 when thinking of trading. You can generally get 7 GPT for a Luxury Resource on Standard, 8 on Quick. You can also trade your copies for AI copies; this potentially gives you +6 Happiness.  Their UI is nice if you can get to it, no reason not to build it if you can really. Marshes are terrible until you get Polders though Flood Plains aren't that bad. If you can settle near those tiles and not suffer early, they'll be strong, but I don't recommend placing your cities in places that will rely on Polders.  The Sea Beggar is useless on Pangaea which is the map I generally play on. It seems like a nice enough unit, though it is melee. I'm not sure how much the melee vs. ranged comparison translates to naval combat but I'd assume it's more or less the same."

civ,3d3mbv,CorporalClegg25,4,Wed Jul 15 01:48:15 2015 UTC,"There are two types of Happiness, Local and Global. I'll talk about Unhappiness.  Global Unhappiness is very hard to deal with. Global Unhappiness is caused by having cities, Ideological pressure, and Annexing/Puppeting/Razing cities. Global Unhappiness can only be affected by Global Happiness. Unique Luxuries and Wonders such as Notre Dame will help deal with Global Unhappiness. When you have excess copies of Unique Luxuries, see if you can trade them to other Civs for copies of their Unique Luxuries. You can also achieve Ally Status with a City State. The City State will add its Unique Luxuries to your empire, increasing your Global Happiness.  Local Unhappiness is much easier to deal with. Local Unhappiness is caused by having citizens. Each Citizen provides 1 Local Unhappiness. Buildings, such as the Colosseum, Circus, and Pagodas, will help provide Local Happiness. Note that a City can only add as much Local Happiness to the empire as it has Citizens. A city with Population 3, a Circus, and a Colosseum is only providing +3 Happiness. If it grows to Population 4, it will provide a +4 bonus, the full bonus from the Circus and Colosseum.  Founding cities in locations with Unique Luxuries you don't already have and/or near Horses or Ivory (an improved Horse or Ivory tile near a city allows it to build a Circus) can help keep your empire Happy. Picking Ideological Tenets, such as Freedom's Capitalism, can also increase your Local Happiness.  One way to ensure your empire stays Happy is to limit the Population in some of your cities to the amount of Local Happiness available to that city. If a city has access to a Colosseum, Circus, and Pagoda, there's no reason not to grow that city to Population 6. However, if the city is not in an ideal location and cannot build a Circus, you may want to limit it to Population 4.  Unless you're going wide, you generally don't want to limit your cities in this regard. When you go tall, try to make sure your cities are in places where they have access to Luxuries. Getting a Religion may give you access to Happiness buildings. Optimize your Ideology tenets to provide as much Happiness as you can. If your empire is getting close to being Unhappy, limit your growth until you have the Happiness to support higher Populations and prioritize Happiness buildings. I hope this helps."

civ,3d3mbv,Honeycombe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:28:39 2015 UTC,"I believe there's an option on the city screen that has the governor avoid growth. That said, I recommend getting used to micromanaging the citizens on your cities. To limit growth, stop working Food tiles and switch to Production or Gold if you need it. I recommend Production.  As for micromanaging, set your cities to Production Focus if you're okay exploiting a bug, otherwise anything else. Decide what your city needs to be doing and lock the worked tiles accordingly. Every time your city grows return to the city screen and adjust your worked tiles.  For example, in the beginning of the game I set my Capital to Production Focus. Every time it grows, I immediately switch the new citizen from the Production tile to a Food tiles.  It may seem tedious at first but it gets easier and quicker the more you do it."

civ,3d3mbv,Bragior,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"On each turn, the game evaluates the amount of resources added from each city. When your city grows, the resources from the new tile get added at the end of the round. However, for some reason Production is added at the beginning of the round. Via this bug, you get an extra tile's worth of Production for one turn. This is generally one or two but every little bit helps."

civ,3d3mbv,Patrik333,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:15 2015 UTC,"With all of the great people, the trade-off is between long-term income (from the tile improvement) and short-term income (from whatever the other option is). The question to ask yourself is whether the short-term burst of x gets you enough to justify sacrificing the long-term benefit. Probably the most obvious example is with the Great Engineer. I almost always use my engineers to rush wonders. I value 4 happiness per turn (part of Chichen Itza's or Notre Dame's benefit) at least as highly as 4 hammers per turn. You're already doing this calculation for your scientists and merchants. For cultural great people, I often factor in the cost of building, say, an amphitheater now rather than later. For this reason I'll often not make great works with my writers and artists. I almost never do this with musicians, though, since the tourism from early musicians is so weak that it's not clear they're worth sending on a tour unless you are already really close to a cultural victory."

I prefer to puppet a city near me and run a sea trade route. If you have a bigger city:   you have more citizens in your city to work mines, hammers and gold, and to work specialist slots while still growing. you'll get foreign trade routes sent to you because the base income of your city is higher - which is a much cheaper way of making money   The food from internal trade routes is produced out of nothing, so you might as well produce one and increase the growth of your capital city by 200%."

So look for something with HD 6000, which is considerably better than HD 5500.  Now some reasons why you are paying such a premium price for this are -  1) 1440p res - You are obviously not going to play at this resolution, so paying extra for it when you'll playing Civ V doesn't makes sense. Stick to 1080p  2)  512gb SSD - Having an SSD for strategic games like Civ V and RPGs like Fallout, Skyrim really helps with the loading times. But the difference in price between 512gb ssd and a 256 gb is quite significant IMO, so stick with 256gb if you can. Even better get something without an ssd, and later add one yourself.  Basically you have to improve on gpu. If you have the budget, you can retain the 1440p res and 512gb ssd, otherwise you have to trim on those  GPU's go like this  15w - HD 6000 > HD 5500  30w - Iris 6100  50w - Iris 6200   ^ This one is the best but consumes more power and I don't think it would be available in a hybrid.

civ,3d3mbv,themolestedsliver,2,Wed Jul 15 01:01:15 2015 UTC,"For playing against the AI, look to civs that have unique ranged or siege units. Also look to the Aztecs, since they get serious amounts of culture from warfare, and Japan, whose units can often go 1-for-2 with rival units of the same technology level.  Early game rushes: The Huns, with their battering rams and horse archers, are really good at this. Go Honor for the great general and take out a neighbor. If you're not feeling a happiness crunch yet, take out another. By now you should be in a really solid position and ready to dominate even after your special units become obsolete.  Mid game strength: I like England for this. Longbowmen with their 3 range are crazy good. You don't need to level up your units and you can siege cities without taking damage. China's Chu-Ko-Nu are similarly amazing, although I think more suited to defense than offense (comparatively). Go honor second (if at all), with either Liberty or Tradition first. Regardless of which civ you use for this, make sure you get your crossbowmen before you go for universities, or you will limit their usefulness. You can still win with crossbows against muskets, but you won't complete a world conquest at the speed that goes. If you're looking at a map with lots of coastal capitals, then England's Ships of the Line are nigh-unstoppable if you get 3-5 of them before your rivals get beyond caravel tech.  Late game: I actually have no idea. I suspect that by this point in a game, economic or science advantages will have far outstripped any military edge. Artillery are really good, as are bombers and tanks of all types."

civ,3d3mbv,MrDyl4n,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Cultural influence is based on your Tourism output compared to the other Civs total Culture. Work your guilds as much as possible so you can spam Great Works. Every Great Work provides Tourism. Make sure you have the buildings to place them in though. Building more cities helps this out. Make sure you utilize your Theming Bonuses. Use your Great Musicians for the Concert Tours. You generate a large amount of Tourism with one Civ and a bit with every other Civ. Get open borders, trade routes, put a Diplomat in their Capital and have a shared religion. These each provide a stacking (additive) 25% bonus to Tourism output with the Civ.

On the surface, that's totally worth it for me, but I'm worried that I might not actually want the Great Merchant points.

civ,3d3mbv,chartear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"My first instinct is to say ""it isn't"", but since I'm guessing someone presumably knowledgeable told you this, let's see if we can figure out what they were trying to say.  When you say ""work"", do you mean building tile improvements or assigning your city's workers? If the latter, are you doing this at the expense of working workshop or university specialist slots? If not, are you working flatland desert tiles or other hexes which provide less than 3 total units of yield? (If not that either, I'm out of ideas. Any of those three I can explain.)"
civ,3d3mbv,GaschMoney,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"Adding to this, it depends on what your city needs. If you can't afford the city to grow and there are no workable tiles that won't leave you with a Food surplus, leave some of the citizens temporarily unassigned.  If you're building a Settler, see if an unassigned Citizen will yield higher Production. There's a conversion rate between Food surplus and Production while building a Settler, but the +1 Production from the Citizen may be better depending on your Food surplus.  It's generally a better idea to work the tiles, but there are situations where you wouldn't. I can't think of any more at the moment."

civ,3d3mbv,deityblade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Got it. So, as long as you aren't making roads everywhere, you aren't in bad shape. Extra mines, even unused, don't cost anything. That's the good news.  The bad news is that you probably aren't gaining anything from your extra mines either. Your city only gives you the yields from a number of hexes around it equal to its population. It's definitely worthwhile to build mines/farms/etc on that many hexes around your city, but additional tile improvements don't do anything until your city increases in population again. If your city is growing rapidly, or if you want to manually change your city's tile selection (say, you're building a wonder and really want the extra production right now), then it is worthwhile to have a few extra tile improvements to swap in or out of use as desired. Any improvements beyond that, however, are worker turns that could have been spent improving the land around other cities. Also keep in mind that cities can only use tiles that are within a 3-hex radius, but their borders can extend out to a 5-hex radius. Those extra two rings are not worth putting tile improvements on unless they have luxury or strategic resources (or you're building forts)."

I'm in a game where I'm protecting England from the Aztecs. I managed to declare war on the Aztecs so I could bombard some of their cannons with my frigate. I managed to keep the frigate alive, and Elizabeth kept York. Also, she somehow managed to keep Hastings from the Spanish (IDK what I did, but in other reloads Hastings was captured). The Aztecs offered my a deal where I got one of their cities for peace. I accepted, but I accidentally annexed it instead of razing. I could raze now, but the policy costs are already increased. I reloaded because I had plans to attack Greece, but he saw the buildup and told me to declare war. It didn't go well, so I had to reload. When I played the save from before I attacked the Aztecs, I was unable to prevent the capture of Hastings and the loss of my frigate after I defended York. If I was able to get the city again and razed it immediately, would the culture costs increase?"

civ,3d3mbv,Quappas,2,Thu Jul 16 05:01:49 2015 UTC,"Basically you want to get your settlers out as soon as possible. There are just a few things more important, so one possible build order is the following (assuming Pangea map and standard speed):  (Try to settle on a hill or a lux and to work 3 food or 2 food 1 hammer tiles in the beginning to speed things up. Start scouting for ruins and expand locations with you warrior. Research pottery.)  1) Scout  2) Scout  (You'll want to uncover your surroundings and grab some ruins ASAP. 2 scouts will explore most of the interesting places before your settlers are done. In addition the timing works out so that the scouts are done building when pottery finishes. If the second scout is done before pottery finishes, work on a worker until pottery is done, then cancel the worker and build a shrine.)  3) Shrine  (There is a pantheon worth grabbing 90% of the time, even if you don't want to get a religion. Research animal husbandry and bronze working next, so you know where the strategic resources are before you are about to found cities. After that you'll want the techs to improve your tiles, especially the ones for your luxes. You can skip pottery and the shrine, but I would not recommend it. Note that you do not have to build a monument. The tradition opener gets you 3 culture per turn, which is enough to grab the policy that gives you free monuments in your first four cities relatively soon, especially if your scouts find a culture ruin.)  4) Worker  (You'll want a worker either before starting settlers or after your first one, because you need to improve your luxes to keep your happiness while planting cities. In addition the worker can help to speed up settler production by building mines and cutting down forests. If you get lucky and want to speed things up even more, try to steal a worker from a city state. You can make peace with a city state on the same turn. Just don't overdo this as the other civs in the game will start to dislike you for warmongering and grabbing workers left and right. If there is a contested spot you want to reach ASAP, build 1 settler, then get a worker.)  5) Settlers!  (With tradition, your goal should be to get around 3 settlers out, depending on available land. Note that your capital can not grow while building settlers, neither does it need any food to maintain its population. Instead, there is some weird mechanism converting excess foot into hammers for your settler. Play around with your tiles to make sure you produce your settlers as fast as possible. It can be beneficial to delay your settlers a few turns, if your capital is right about to grow. Make sure to escort your settler with a military unit, either with your starting warrior, your scouts, or a unit you bought or fit in somewhere. After that, I prefer to get a worker and a military unit for all of my cities. New cities should either build a granary or a library first, make sure the libraries are done as soon as you finish researching philosophy to start building the national college.)"

Well, generally speaking, you want keep a city that fulfills at least one, preferably two or three of the following conditions:   The city is well developed (you saved a lot of buildings and at least 10 population) The city has a new unique luxury you didn't already have The city is in a strategically important position (foothold on a new continent, canal city, gives you a border with a civ you didn't already have one with, etc) The city has a world wonder (bonus if it's a good one, I'll keep something like Forbidden Palace or Notre Dame no matter how crappy the city is) The city will not drop you into negative happiness (being in negative happiness for a few turns isn't the end of the world as long as you don't drop below -10, especially if it's a good city, but try to avoid it if you can) The city is an original capital (you can't raze these but you could sell them, personally I never do in case I decide to go for domination and because these cities are often very good, well developed cities)   Otherwise, raze it.   When do I want to annex a puppet i had for a while?   As soon as the city is out of resistance and annexing the city won't drop you into negative happiness.

Not to mention, putting spears in front of them ends an attack until you tech up.  Yes, that's ideal situation. But protecting archers with spears is a solid strat anyway.

At the end of the day, you're playing with friends, and that means you're probably playing for fun, that is unless you're all competitive. At the end of the day, if you kill one of your friends, and the other is still in the game, that means that you've just kicked them out of the game, and refused to let them play. If you're in a group of competitive players, then no problem, thats their fault and they should see the error in their play. If you're in a chill game, then they likely assumed you wouldn't kill them and played for fun, attacking an AI instead.  TL;DR: Set a goal to the game, if you're playing with weaker players, just chill and take the advantage without killing them.

In Civ someone with more experience and more skill can just crush you every ... single .... time. (e.g. someone usually playing immortal vs someone usually playing prince)... Not fun.

Maybe this should have been discussed before their game.

During this time, the two people next to me moved all of their armies to as close to my territories as possible. As soon as I joined the game they declared war and tried to defend themselves by claiming they were being fair by waiting for me to come back.   It was such BS.

Games last months, and the investment is so real that I've not been able to sleep if we end for the night a turn or two before I'm supposed to finish a wonder.   War is extremely brutal; all of us scheme on each other, and getting a sizeable score lead is asking for trouble. While getting knocked out a few sessions in blows, and people can get salty, we all understand that getting knocked out of the game or being turned into a one city vassal are risks we have to live with. Once you get past that, the game is a ton of fun. The AI SUCKS at war, especially naval war. If you can have a few friends mature enough to fight each other without raging, you will discover a much deeper, more enjoyable game."

This is why when I play with friends we normally co-operate or form human VS human teams with an agreed mandatory peace period (eg: no war till turn 200).  Despite this, your friend definitely overreacted. Unless otherwise discussed, war is fair in Civ and losing is part of the game."

He got real mad, and just quit and caused a chain reaction resulting everyone else to leave. Never played with him from that moment.

I usually go for mathematics and construction, make 2 siege towers, 3 if the enemy is in a particularly tricky spot and about 4 composite bowman, then proceed to conquer my entire continent. If you spawn near civs which tend to go tall and from top of the tree, it is even better. You usually end up at top of science from your conquests, with nothing left to acquire thus transition to scientific or cultural until late game. Don't research writing to get royal libraries, it is a rookie mistake, take it from your enemies, then getting them in every city as you should will provide you with plenty of spots for great writing slots and bonus xp on top later in game to acquire some more tech, usually with artillery.   Also as a side bonus they scale surprisingly well with difficulty because AI having a tech advantage over you means you can get more tech from them."

Some of the things interesting things are the fact that    your initial warrior is a unique unit so you get a little help against barbs Want to fuck up your neighbor? go steal his worker/settler and then jump off the coast and swim home. 99% chance you won't encounter a barbarian galley and they can't do jack for a while. Focus on science early on so you have a great chance at hosting the World Congress since you can immediately sail the oceans. Placing Moai on the coasts does sacrifice some production/food benefits but I almost always end up with a high GPT in the Renaissance onward.

Or  an admiral, to explore ocean, or a great general to (re)claim some luxuries from an annoying forward settler? The choice is yours.  Inca are pretty fun too, because you just ignore hills completely while exploring - later on, you can just put roads on every single hill in your borders without cost, and it becomes even better if you find Mt Kilimanjaro.

Once you play Inca for 2 games in the road you start think shit like: ""Why does building all these random ass roads take all my money?"", ""Wait why can't I keep moving?"", and ""Holy shit a terrace farm there would be amazing.""  Persia too. If you know what you're doing you'll pretty much be in a permanent golden age. Which means permanent production, gold, combat, and movement boost. I know the movement might not seem that insane but it really is. It means that your siege units can move, set up, and fire on the same turn. Your workers can improve a hill tile instantly. It doesn't take you seven years to move through all the forest that fuck boi Hiawatha set up."

civ,3d2y51,zlolslavez,6,Tue Jul 14 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"Congrats on beating the next level and preparing to take the next step. I'll offer some general feedback based on your comments here.  Science helps every victory type, including cultural. It does this by giving you access to things earlier. The higher in difficulty you go, the more important science is just to be able to compete with the AI. One tip is to get your National College up as soon as possible after settling 2-3 extra cities. Don't be afraid to spend the 400 gold to rush buy a Library in your last expand to get this up faster.  That said, I would advise against building the Great Library. That early in the game, you should be putting your production into things like Settlers, Workers, Archers... just about anything else. While it's bonuses are rather huge, you'll just be getting into bad habits since you'll never get to build it on higher difficulties.  The biggest thing about stepping up to Prince is that you now have to worry about happiness. It's not uncommon to find yourself unhappy the first time you settle an expansion city! It's not the end of the world, but you want to keep it to a minimum. So while you're expanding, also be getting a worker. Whether that means building one or stealing one. You'll want to hook up a unique luxury or two to keep your happiness up. Don't be afraid to develop duplicates either since you can trade them to other civs for the extra luxuries they have that you don't.  If you're interested, I've made a video addressing coordinating keeping your happiness up while expanding. You can find it here:  https://youtu.be/ClocpkCQxYs"
civ,3d2y51,Billagio,3,Mon Jul 13 07:24:12 2015 UTC,Start priotizing Science as you rack up the difficulties.  As well as luxuries since for the most part you won't have access to as much happiness as you would on lower difficulties.
civ,3d2y51,6180339887,2,Mon Jul 13 02:57:33 2015 UTC,I usually drift towards cultural victories so I'll have to learn how to earn high amounts of science. I do know that settling next to mountains are a big advantage for observatories. Any other tips for science?
civ,3d2y51,Kurvatis,2,Mon Jul 13 03:32:08 2015 UTC,"If you want to win something that isn't Diplomatic on higher difficulties, then you are going to need to prioritize science technologies, starting with Education, then Scientific Theory, then eventually Plastics, for the buildings of Universities, Public Schools, and Research labs. You can grab techs such as Construction for CBs, or civ specific buildings on the way, but try to ""beeline"" those techs.  (Sailing too, but sometimes I get lazy on ocean exploring and don't grab sailing until I need it for Particle Physics in the Information Era, especially when I only play on Pangaea)"
civ,3d2y51,Thatperson7,2,Mon Jul 13 03:42:32 2015 UTC,Is the Great Library wonder worth building? I've learned to stop building every available wonder (They're so tempting!) but this one seems really useful
civ,3d2y51,6180339887,2,Mon Jul 13 04:07:48 2015 UTC,Its good until around emperor when it's hard to get it consistently since the AI likes it as well. If you build it every game you will have a harder time on higher diffs since you rely on getting it but suddenly won't be able to
civ,3d2y51,deityblade,2,Mon Jul 13 04:32:42 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn to beat higher difficulties, I'd say don't build it. The AI simply gets it way earlier than you (I play on emperor and it's usually around turn 40, and in deity it's on turn 30 or so).  Also, many games I find myself not building any wonders early (until tower of pisa, or petra if I had a good petra city) because it slows your progress so much and the #1 priority on the early game is having your 4 cities (if playing tall which I usually do) and then working on fixing your money and happiness."
civ,3d2y51,TheMarshmallowBear,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, Great Library is one of the really strong wonders, and generally players who build it get a lead on science for a while."

civ,3d0jy3,Superhotglue,248,Sun Jul 12 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"It's a sorta cool game the first couple of times you play it but it lacks replayability cause there's not much depth to the mechanics and the victory conditions are boring as shit. (They're basically research to a tech, build something and wait.)  The leaders lack uniqueness (no unique units, unique abilities are just minor bonuses). The developers went for a system where you can customise your start but it's just a bit bland and samey. (You can pick +2 food, +2 hammers, +2 beakers etc for your cities, and you can get either a worker, soldier, free building to start with but it just pales in comparison to having actual civs with a set of unique aspects that let you try different strategies as different leaders.)  The graphics are a bit of a problem too. Visually the game is pretty cool but it has some practical problems. I find it really hard to tell what terrain is what unless I have tile yields displayed and maybe it's just my brightness settings that need adjusted but the whole interface was so dark, the minimap might as well not have been there cause it's just goddamn black on black.  A lot of stuff that made Civ 5 interesting got dropped. Tourism is gone, great people are gone, ideology is really streamlined (or dumbed down). To be fair a lot of that came from the expansions to Civ 5, so maybe it's a bit unfair to expect it in a fresh game, but it makes the game feel very basic when you move from Civ 5. A lot of basic stuff just seemed overlooked and missing - like there are no techs to speed up movement of embarked units which really pisses me off. (Although there are units that hover over the water, which is pretty cool.) The unit promotion system (ie getting drill 1, drill 2 and working your way to the interesting promotions) has been scrapped in favour of units getting 3 levels of veterancy that give them 10% extra strength which makes it a bit boring.  There are a few things I like. The tech web is a cool concept and is potentially more interesting than the tech tree; it's confusing as shit to start with but I think if the game itself was more engaging and I spent enough time playing it patterns would start to emerge and it'd be a way to vary your games, trying different strategies and paths. The quests system also has potential although it's pretty boring at the moment where it's basically build a building and get a prize.  Overall it's not a bad game as such... it's just not great and compared to Civ 5 it's just shit. I think it has a lot of potential (I never played the original Civ 5, just after the expansions, but I gather it wasn't nearly as good initially) but even after the expansion that's coming out I'd imagine it'll still be pretty bland. Maybe in a year or two it'll have enough content to compete with Civ 5.  EDIT:  Oh yeah and trade routes. Goddamn trade routes. Trade routes are per city now so you get loads of them and it's just a pain to micro. Fuck trade routes man"
civ,3d0jy3,TheAlmightyBob,33,Sun Jul 12 16:16:34 2015 UTC,"I played some BE this weekend and trade routes have ""auto renew"" option now.   What I miss the most is felling of technological advancement. In civ 5 you go from warriors with axes to deathrobots and Xcoms, here co you can get some nice units like robots, but it doesn't feel any different then rover you get as 1st tech."
civ,3d0jy3,Klosu,15,Sun Jul 12 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think they could have done really well if they went from near future tech to super powerful tech. Instead they prove very capable early in the game, and super advanced technology is produced quickly and easily.    I would have loved to have started out in a relatively small and powerless society of people who traveled millions of miles with no way of knowing exactly what they were getting into. Start us off with no weapons besides security tazers because we had no idea we'd be facing an alien threat, make us work for it damnit! I wanted to be facing impossible odds in dealing with an alien wilderness. I wanted to survive and conquer, not thrive and exterminate. Everything feels handed to us on a silver platter."
civ,3d0jy3,TheMeanCanadianx,6,Sun Jul 12 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest problems in the game for me, it doesn't feel like I'm fighting to survive in the early game, the aliens are almost inconsequential as long as you don't get too close to a nest."
civ,3d0jy3,Aea,4,Mon Jul 13 06:14:00 2015 UTC,"I really like the new military unit system, the way you can choose between 3 different upgrades for all your units.  The main problem with military is that you HAVE TO rush affinity point techs or you're going to get slaughtered by INSANELY stronger units at level 4/7/etc.  That's the main problem with the game imo, that there's no smooth increases in power, it's huge discrete jumps at different affinity levels."
civ,3d0jy3,ashishduh1,2,Mon Jul 13 00:49:34 2015 UTC,"I hate the military system, or at least the system in practice, and I made a thread about it on the BE sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/civbeyondearth/comments/3cboof/few_tradeoffs_for_military_progression/.      TLDR: The pace of military advancement is so fast and cheap that the game forces you into a militarily dominant play style.

civ,3d0jy3,TheAlmightyBob,2,Sun Jul 12 19:32:38 2015 UTC,Pretty much. It suffers the exact same problem that Civ5 had when it first launched. Despite a couple cool new features overall It's way too simplified when compared to its predecessor.  Compared to Civ 5 with all its dlc plus the Community Balance Patch Mod its a huge step back.  I know why they did it that way. It's to keep it approachable to new players (which they need in order for the Civilisation franchise to continue on) but it sucks for us returning players.

civ,3d0jy3,AnonymousHerbMan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:40:50 2015 UTC,I miss the traits in Alpha Centauri that were both positive and negative. Playing the Human Hive was quite different from playing Morgan Industries or Lord's Believers. Bland bonuses makes the game bland and all options play out essentially the same as the others. I think they should have gone for 1) a more challenging game and 2) traits that impact the game.
civ,3d0jy3,helm,91,Thu Jul 16 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"Played it a bit and I can tell you that the colour palette can be somewhat nauseating. The factions are Alpha Centauri wannabes and as the entire game tries to be Alpha Centauri descendant, it doesn't do well.    The story is non-existent. You have to read it all elsewhere.  Aliens are nothing special.  Technology web is quite confusing. New DLC will give you something modders did for Civ 5 and was immediately available in SMAC.   But I must say, even though it requires some working on, the paths for future of humanity you may choose are quite good. Supremacy all the way.   All in all, it lacks a certain spirit SMAC had."
civ,3d0jy3,Paligor,25,Sun Jul 12 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"A bit part of this is the frankly awful tech naming in BE. So many techs have sci-fi gibberish for names with no clear tie like your great Industrialization technology example. Like, ""synthetic thought"" doesn't really mean anything, why is it fairly late in the tech tree and why is it a leaf tech for artificial intelligence, ""synthetic thought"" seems like another word for ""artificial intelligence"", but apparently these are two technologies so unique I'm supposed to research them separately and be excited when research completes. And it unlocks my... Cynosure.   I look up Cynosure and it has a 5 paragraph piece of fiction about it but it's more made up words and made up names that provide me with no real context or comparison. So I'm researching a gibberish tech, with no clear relation to the surrounding techs, to get a gibberish wonder. It's the least intuitive thing ever.   And then you build the Cynosure... and you discover it eats up 4 firaxiate to give +1 science per 3 citizens, so total hot garbage. Worse than a Library in Civ 5, but since science is so confusingly handled in Civ BE it's maybe worth building? If you have a massive 30 pop city that's 8 whole science per turn! Exciting. So you go through all that confusing gibberish to build a wonder that increases your overall science by about 2%.   So you navigate confusing gibberish to research a tech that has no satisfying resolution to build a wonder that has no satisfying or impactful effect on your empire.   That right there sums up, to me, why Civ BE is a lot less fun to play. There's rarely ever a sense of payoff or achievement during the game, just confusingly named techs leading to confusingly named buildings that give incremental and uninteresting bonuses that accrue over time. It's like an interest rate simulator."
civ,3d0jy3,beeblez,5,Sun Jul 12 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Have you played SMAC? The way technology was handled there didn't make it sound like blatant nonsense and actually had basis. Not only that, there is a story behind everything there."

Like, for Cynosure, just called it ""Planetary Library"" or ""Data Accelerator"" or something that clearly flags it's a science-ish wonder. I just made those up off the top of my head in like 10 seconds, it's not that hard. They do a good job of this with many techs and wonders (""Crawler"" is great for being both evocative and descriptive, all in one word), but overall really needed more polish."

civ,3d0jy3,ALLAH_WAS_A_SANDWORM,45,Sun Jul 12 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"The linear tech tree in Civ 5 is intuitive because it basically follows human history. Ex: You know that ""Industrialization"" means coal and factory. And the natural progression would be oil, flight, and 1900's style vehicles.  The spider web tech tree in B.E. is cool as a sci-fi game. But off the top of your head you wouldn't know what they mean and their natural progression chain."
civ,3d0jy3,kingp1ng,4,Sun Jul 12 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"I'd say there could be a fair amount of compromise between the two, as we obviously have no choice but to adhere to the natural progression but there could be a fair amount of deviation within it that could allow for some much better ""specialized"" countries that make more sense, like two civs could be in the same era and one civ could end up being characterized as a very mathematically proficient people, and that can lead to them having superior siege weapons, the mechanics of which are unknown to other civs in the same era. while the other could be particularly researched into astronomy, and leads them to become a much more wayfaring nation and naval force than their fellow civs.  Same general ""gist"" as the current civ 5 tree, but with multiple ""ways"" to choose and specialize in that you don't have the ability to use all at once.

I wish Civ V had slightly more choice in the tech tree - things like branches that led to dead ends, but gave you a powerful unit at the end of the branch, or places where you have to choose outright between two techs - e.g. you can have a bonus to navy or a bonus to land, but even if you can spare the research, it's impossible to get both bonuses..."

The AI (alien and humie) are also anemic. I was hoping for a starship troopers style smash and colonize thing, but the aliens ended up just being dumb caterpillars to squish.   Meanwhile in Alpha Centauri, the harder you beat on the planet, the more resistance it starts to field. It starts spreading fugus everywhere that you can't build on, and spawning worms that kill your shit. The worms also work on a different combat system, psi combat, so regardless of how good your units are tech wise, the worms always pose a threat. In BE, as soon as you get good tech, the aliens become a complete joke.  I hate to always bring up AC in BE threads, but through that magnifying glass you can see why BE was pretty badly designed"

When you've got a jungle swarming with alien life in the early game, it makes that territory very costly to expand into. Likewise a pod of leviathan will zone you out of open ocean exploration and lock you into the coast by necessity until you tech up to take them out. This feels exactly like the hostile planet fantasy they wanted. However, sometimes the aliens wimp out, or they don't get the world they need to thrive. Aliens on a flat plain are pretty easy pickings, and then you've tamed the wild west.  Where I'd really like to see an improvement for the aliens is in the wrath of the planet. I'd like to see abused aliens spawn more and aggressively against players that chop down trees and clear nests. Ideally, I'd like a scary warrior-creature that only comes out when you've enraged the planet (worms can be scary, but only really in packs. A lone worm causes some farm damage and then gets picked off by artillery)."

civ,3d0jy3,DoctorJohnZoidbergMD,8,Sun Jul 12 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is that there is basically no personality. In talks with other civs, they don't move, there's no voice acting, they all say the exact same thing... it just feels empty."
civ,3d0jy3,TheParagonal,8,Sun Jul 12 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the leaders in Civ 5 also repeat the same bland phrases if you actually pay attention, but there is actually some diversity to their culture and they all speak their traditional languages (or as close as Firaxis could get.)  Also, I feel like the fact that you automatically know where your rivals land and meet them immediately kind of ruins the sense of exploration - you don't have to wonder when you might come across another civ or end up completely in isolation. Also, there are no natural wonders and the crashed pods that replace ruins only spawn in limited numbers around your landing site, so you're again left with much less incentive to explore."
civ,3d0jy3,Chaingunfighter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:31 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame there's so little meaningful exploration in BE. It makes sense in the age of satellites, but it's just such a shame. I wonder if there would be a way to make the tech tree randomize in such a way that it would be unique to every single game while still making sense..."
civ,3d0jy3,nicegrapes,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:42 2015 UTC,I like the idea of the tech tree and I think it could be meaningful even in a more worldly focused Civ 6.  I've always liked the idea of certain points of the tech tree where they branch off and eventually allow you to connect to other major sections without having to research the prerequisites at the cost of not gaining the advantages of the previous techs. That way you can still have linear progression of technology to the point that everyone will eventually reach a modern age in a realistic pattern but still have variation and specialization that comes beforehand.
civ,3d0jy3,Chaingunfighter,6,Sun Jul 12 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"From what I hear, I think it is suffering from the same thing Civ 5 suffered at launch, namely lack of content compared to predecessors. Give it an expansion or two and it'll be right as rain."
civ,3d0jy3,Clad_in_Plaid,3,Sun Jul 12 23:28:21 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that. I'm definitely finding it less interesting than civ v but I think that's because I'm used to playing it with all expansions almost from the beginning. It's also less intuitive because historically we know what a scout or infantry are. A CMDR or disciple doesn't automatically tell you what it is
civ,3d0jy3,mr_freeman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't have launched as basic as Civ V was when it came out.  If you're just ripping the same engine and 1/2 the gameplay; why pare it down to exclude most all of the content for the base game?    That right there is the biggest problem with BE.  You went from playing Civ V with DLC/Expansions; to playing a version of Vanilla Civ V that could have been created by a great modder, but also cost you as much as a brand new game."
civ,3d0jy3,Xaphe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:08:51 2015 UTC,"That's the new civ game cycle. Start off two steps back, but w/ expansions it becomes two steps forward. I can't say I'm not satisfied with the final product (as in w/ expansions) but they should really just work on adding more into the base game before release."
civ,3d0jy3,Clad_in_Plaid,6,Mon Jul 13 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Wonders that aren't wonderful (they are boring)  Specialists that aren't special (3 gold, no GPP.  But that tile over there gives 3 gold...)  Quests that give empty choices (+1 culture or upkeep free)  No luxuries to trade  More strategic than anyone can use  The map is Civ5 IN SPACE!!! Miasma and aliens dont really do anything and a simple fence keeps them out  Peaceful victories are passive and not competitive.  Enjoy solitaire?"
civ,3d0jy3,Andy06r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Peaceful victories are passive and not competitive. Enjoy solitaire?   I'm not quite sure I follow you here. Are you saying that there's no reason to try and take down a civ that's say, building a mind flower/mind stem?  If not, I'm not really sure what you mean. In Civ Science victories, you're always racing against anyone who's starting to build their parts, and can ruin their victory by trying to eliminate them/take their resources/out-build them. Sure, there were more ways to stop it, but it could be entirely passive, too.  I'm not sure I made my point very clearly, but meh."
civ,3d0jy3,seandkiller,3,Mon Jul 13 03:19:22 2015 UTC,"Civ5 Culture often involves head shotting a cultural run away.  Looting digs and museums.  Diplomacy involves competing with CSs.  This can create negative modifiers with other states that want this victory.  You need to manage good relations to turn your resources into cash.  Science might involve combat for strategic or mountains, but can be played solitaire.  Good relations for agreements.  Solitaire = Gameplay where you can win without AI making you change decisions.  Old school culture victory and science victories fit the bill.  I consider races to the finish solitaire because of how rarely the finish is actually that close - you already won or already lost."
civ,3d0jy3,Andy06r,5,Mon Jul 13 03:55:22 2015 UTC,It gets old quick. The game is fun for the first few games but then it just gets bland. The leaders have no personality and the graphics are very dark and hard to look at. I really hope rising tides makes it better.
civ,3d0jy3,sameth1,4,Sun Jul 12 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"In my opinion...  BAD THINGS   The maps are all kind of basically the same. The tech web is confusing Because it's sci-fi, it's hard to quickly figure out what the various techs are supposed to do. Like in Civ V if you build a library or a harbour, you know what those are. But in BE it's like ""Do I want to build a Gene Farm? What is it?"" You can find out but it slows everything down. It's a lot shallower than Civ V is, although to be fair Civ V was also like that before it got all it's big DLC upgrades. There aren't many leaders, but the same caveat as above applies to that too.   But also...  GOOD THINGS!   Sea monsters are always cool. I like how they handle the aliens, which are like the BE version of Barbarians. If you just go around mindlessly slaughtering them you can take a diplomatic hit with other Leaders for not respecting the indigenous life. That's something I wouldn't mind seeing in regular Civ too. The orbital layer is kind of gimmicky, but I like it as a concept. It just needs more stuff to do in it. That's also something that could be a cool late-game thing for regular Civ (like you could drop X-COM squads from orbit or something)  Troops and vehicles look different when they upgrade depending on the policy choices you make. Actually all these things would be cool in Civ. :)"
civ,3d0jy3,DeedTheInky,7,Sun Jul 12 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"Trade routes were Fixed to let you auto renew them. they are not nearly as bad now after the patches. Wonders used to Suck balls and you couldn't tell what the hell was a wonder. Was also Patched in and they aren't a joke anymore.Difficulty was Fixed as well, apollo was made harder many players were playing 2nd hardest difficulty with no problems. I find the game to be heavy resource intensive There is no horses and iron you are going to be using up those resources and be really lacking at point in the game if you aren't lucky.  The people complaining there isnt enough stuff in the game Well, Everybody here said the Same thing about civ 5 at launch that Civ 4 was better. The rising Tide is coming and it should take it a step in the right direction.  My biggest Gripes Are Sea combat is non existant, Starting units are armed with wet noodles, and there isnt even enough factions to fill the biggest sized map.(unmodded) There is no Melee Sea unit, like WTF? you do get hover combat rover but that's late game. Rising tide will help both of these Add depth with hybrid affinities diplomacy and artifacts, Sea cities(nuff said) new factions, 2 new biomes volcanic and frost maybe one will suit you better The Tech tree will probably get Looked at quite a bit while they are adding new techs for RT.  TL:DR When the Expansion hits its worth another shot although if your a new player maybe wait for reviews."
civ,3d0jy3,AjCheeze,3,Sun Jul 12 17:19:17 2015 UTC,Do biomes do anything?  I thought they were just skins.
civ,3d0jy3,Andy06r,2,Sun Jul 12 17:45:51 2015 UTC,They are just skins from my knowledge but a lot of people have issues seeing the difference in grasslands plains and desert tiles especially when you throw miasma on top of it. People also get upset and the overly green/teal color sets the new ones are radically different being red and the other being some kind of cold related color set probably whites and blues but i don't think we have seen this one yet.
civ,3d0jy3,AjCheeze,2,Sun Jul 12 17:53:43 2015 UTC,No but it will in Rising Tide. One thing we know it will change is the Aliens behavior (in the primordial biome they get hostile and back to friendly faster) but I think there will be more differences that they will announce later.
civ,3d0jy3,leandrombraz,3,Sun Jul 12 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"you do get hover combat rover but that's late game.   My biggest gripe with Beyond Earth is that there are all these cool game changing units, but it's pushed into the late game. By the time I can get to the really interesting stuff, the game has basically been decided."
civ,3d0jy3,Jman5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:07:34 2015 UTC,So true. Early wars the ailens would get your army before they make to it a base that is loaded up in starting defence( i forget the numbers been a while) Civ 5 if you wanted to war grab some chariots archers and if they dont expect it surprise Your winning the ancient era
civ,3d0jy3,AjCheeze,3,Mon Jul 13 10:45:38 2015 UTC,Keep in mind all CIV games are lacking until all expansions are released. CIV5 was the same when it was first released people preferred civ4 until they released the two expansions.
civ,3d0jy3,Moe90,3,Sun Jul 12 18:34:15 2015 UTC,For me its the color pallette. Its all just too dark and depressing.
civ,3d0jy3,ellevehc,3,Sun Jul 12 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"The main issues for me are that the victory conditions are uninteresting (4 science victories and no cultural/diplomatic victory system) and make the affinity system an all or nothing proposal which for me makes the tech web feel much less free.  My other issue is that in a game where I'm supposedly exploring a new planet, every planet is the same. Other than a slightly different shade of grass, they all have the same fauna, the same minerals, the same atmosphere. There's so much more that they could have done like randomised wildlife with randomised behaviour and randomised conditions on the planet. Perhaps one planet will require inhabitants to wear breathing apparatus to filter the atmosphere meaning a slightly different tech tree compared to somewhere else.  Overall for a game set 'Beyond' Earth it feels much more like it's set on 'Earth 2'."
civ,3d0jy3,Legosheep,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"to be fair a diplo victory probably wouldn't work unless they convert stations to be more like city states. The closest there is is the Harmony Mind Flower thing but even then it's just research this tech, build this wonder, wait x turns, congrats you have fused your peoples consciousness with the planet or whatever"
civ,3d0jy3,Ariakis,3,Mon Jul 13 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"The biggest new feature that's different from Civ V is the tech web, which was a great idea they completely ruined. The idea that your science could advance in completely different directions and allow for a much greater variety of possible strategies had the potential to introduce a wealth of depth into the game. However, because of the way affinities work, players are unable to take advantage of this potential variety.  Each affinity has an associated resource that it needs, and advancing your affinity is necessary to keep your military relevant and stop you from being easy pickings for greedy neighbors. As a result, if you start in an area that has lots of one affinity's resource you pretty much have to go that affinity to be relevant, and are as a result pretty much required to follow a much more restricted tech path for that affinity. The affinity system, rather than giving players more choice, restricts choice. Your start determines your best affinity, which determines the way you proceed down the tech tree.  If this is changed in the upcoming expansion so that affinity becomes a real choice (e.g. each one may have a favorite resource but would still have uses for the others), they could give themselves room to really take advantage of the tech web's full potential. I think that could really enhance the strategic aspect of Beyond Earth."
civ,3d0jy3,Lemonwizard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:46:26 2015 UTC,Visually it's very busy as well. Makes reading it less intuitive
civ,3d0jy3,mr_freeman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"I tend to find it really fun and more realistic that where I start and what I have available to me drastically affects my culture and how I proceed through the game. I can understand the frustration of the affinity points gating the Tech Web options, but trading for resources if you are determined to be an affinity outside of your strategic resources is fun and interesting game for me."
civ,3d0jy3,LilliaHakami,3,Mon Jul 13 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"People are saying what they don't like but I'll tell you a couple of things that I do like.  I like the new culture trees or whatever they're called (been a while since I played lol).  I like all the synergy you can get by combining different trees and going to different depths in each tree.  That's probably the best improvement they made from Civ V where everyone always took roughly the same policies anyway, it was boring.  I also like the starting options better than most people do, as far as gameplay goes.  I know as far as flavor/immersion goes, having unique civs with unique abilities/units/buildings is cool but from a purely gameplay perspective I like all the choices you have to start the game.  I also really like the new military unit system, the way you can choose between 3 different upgrades for all your units.  The main problem with military is that you HAVE TO rush affinity point techs or you're going to get slaughtered by INSANELY stronger units at level 4/7/etc.    That's the main problem with the game imo, that there's no smooth increases in power, it's huge discrete jumps at different affinity levels.  It kinda makes the majority of the game feel meaningless, until you hit those peaks of power."
civ,3d0jy3,ashishduh1,5,Mon Jul 13 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"I like BE better than V, myself.  A lot of the complaints I hear boil down to, ""It's not SMAC, and it's not Civ V.""  To each their own."
civ,3d0jy3,Elliptical_Tangent,2,Sun Jul 12 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"Liked it for the first game then meh, civ 5 I can go back to any time. I think it needs time"
civ,3d0jy3,Rhailian,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"It does fix a few of the problems that Civ V has, but because we can't relate to the techs/eras very well it loses some of the feel of Civ V.  It also is in need of an expansion or two to branch out the game play.  Combat is the one area which is superior, though that still has a few easy tweaks to make it more fun.  Its what I'd call a game that was streamlined for multi-player."
civ,3d0jy3,Drak_is_Right,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"For me, the game was ok but I really enjoy the tie in with actual Earth civilizations (past and present).  Obviously we are playing a game but I like playing as ""real"" civilizations. I also think that plays into the ""lack of personality"" that others have spoken of."
civ,3d0jy3,LJGremlin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:56:43 2015 UTC,It never appealed to me at all. I think people set their expectations too high.
civ,3d0jy3,kDelta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"Visually, I think the game doesn't look very appealing either. They went with a weird color pallet to convey the spacey-ness of it all."

civ,3d0jy3,Chester2674,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:05:05 2015 UTC,"It lacks soul, depth, complexity, and balance. The leaders are bland and lack personality. The wonders are not wonderful. The quests seemed like a cool idea, but they dont really add anything. There is a lot of interesting lore written into the quests and the civilopedia, but the game doesnt present it well. I could go on, but why bother.  As for the expansion, it looks like they will fix some of the issues. For me the real question is will they manage to inject some soul into the game. In my opinion the best way the could do that would be to give the leaders actual personality and present the lore a bit better. Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri was an awesome game, they should have studied it a bit more. I have seen that they are adding water cities like SMAC had, but for me that wasn't what made SMAC cool. SMAC had so much dark lore, story, and personality.  I have been playing Civ since Civ1, have played 2k+ hrs of Civ5, and maybe 200 hrs of BE. Biggest problem for me was multiplayer. I could never finish a game with friends because the game would go out of sync when we loaded a save game."
civ,3d0jy3,Kurgon999,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of the same issues as the top comments have mentioned, but also I felt they just weren't bold enough. The whole world, stories, aliens and technology could've been bolder. The tech tree for instance is a great concept but the techs in it are kind of ""mundane"". I would've loved to see a few original ideas instead of just the same stuff scifi and promises of future tech have given us for decades."
civ,3d0jy3,nicegrapes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, many think that it's just a glorified Civ V mod. By that I mean, they didn't think it added enough features, changed gameplay enough, etc.  I like the game, myself. Playing it right now, in fact. But, like with Civ V, I don't really play it without mods.  On an related note, I'm kinda paranoid about using mods now, since the first (and only, so far) time I played a modded game in BE, victories were impossible. I thought I was going to lose when someone started making the mind flower, until I caught up at least 50 turns later, only to find out that the turns on it didn't count down.  I do wish there were better victory screens, though.  All this in mind, I didn't buy the game myself (it was a gift), so I might be going easier on the game then someone who spent the full $60."
civ,3d0jy3,seandkiller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"It's just like when Civ 5 came out at first, it's blan to start but as the DLC rolls in it significantly improves the game.  With that said though I don't like spending all that cash on DLC so that sucks, but at least what will be put out is normally pretty good stuff."
civ,3d0jy3,najjhhan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"The color palette sucks, and nothing tells you what the units do until after you've burned off production to make them.

civ,3d0jy3,redstarduggan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:30:11 2015 UTC,"Expectations had a lot to do with the reception. Not to say there are not flaws (they are abundant). But for what it is, Beyond Earth doesn't push and celebrate its what makes it different from Civ V, which boils down to people thinking it a rehash, effectively a mod for V.  Things that are cool but aren't where they could be:  Virtues - A vast improvement on Social Policies in my (incredibly newbish opinion). There are 4 tree of policy, each with ""synergy bonuses"" for going both down the same tree and investing in multiple trees. This is not saying anything about the strength, usefulness, or balance of the Virtues,   Affinity - One of the most interesting and most disappointing things about BE. A core game mechanic, affinity is the way in which your colonies advance, their outlook for the future. It changes your military units, unlocks buildings, changes the art of your cities, gives you a few perks. This is great, but it ends about there. The visual changes to leaders (who are fictional and therefore harder to relate to) from affinity don't really deviate from each other. They are more or less palette swaps.  Tech Web - So much mixed responses about this one. There is endless discussion about its balance, graphic representation, and more. I personally like it. My only gripes are the lack of coloration (I run a mod to fix that) and the more tricky congruity of what the techs are and what the techs give.  There are others, but these are some of the more prominent ones."
civ,3d0jy3,DefiantMars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:12:41 2015 UTC,"My biggest gripe is that leaders lack character. Civ 5 has Alexander, Shaka, Elizabeth, Genghis etc. BE has Generic Space Commander #1, Generic Space Commander #2, Generic Space Commander #3..."

civ,3d0jy3,Gregregious,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"Beyond some of the crappy win conditions and balancing, my biggest gripe is that by being set in the future, the game looses historical context. I think this context is what makes Civ fun usually.   This can be from small things like ""Thats funny, America just completed the Kremlin, and the Aztecs just got space flight"", to more important feedback like knowing that barracks are military buildings, and the Louvre probably has something to do with tourism. All of the things we learned about history add to game.  In Beyond Earth, you lose all of that. The world leaders all feel the same, and you have to read if you want any backstory to them. 90% of the buildings have weird futuristic names to them that mean nothing to you other than being +3 health.  Overall its a problem that couldn't have been solved much for a game set in the future, but it would've been nice to name some of the technologies, buildings, and wonders according to common knowledge."

It's a decent enough game, don't get me wrong, but it's a game that I have played before and sunk thousands of hours into, I do not need to pay for it again.  There's also a shitload of minor niggles, like the color palette being too dark/green, the tech web getting convoluted and going wrong, the shortage of really interesting wonders, and the points where it hews too close to Civ5 rather than being really different and sci-fi. Like, despite the fact that this is the future and we obviously have the tech for interstellar transport, I'm still fighting my wars with the same overland-chugging infantry/armor/ranged units, rather than orbitally-deployed special forces, and my worker still build roads one tile at a time, rather than constructing teleport networks. For a game about futuristic conquest, it could stand to be a bit more futuristic.  TLDR: Yeah, it's probably worth it, but only on sale, and yeah, the expansions will probably fix it."

There's no way it's worth what they're asking for it.  You're just playing more Civ V with a space skin. Nothing wrong with that, but it's not a new game."

civ,3d3feu,bc112354,3,Mon Jul 13 05:20:03 2015 UTC,"I find that beginning every match with a little warmongering is a great way to snowball regardless of difficulty  Try to have 2-3 cities by turn 60-70, 4-6 composite bows and 2-3 melee units and fight the civ with the nicest capital (wonders + luxuries).  You should still manage t100 national college (standard pace) as long as you puppet. Then annex after the resistance is over.  This neuters the opposing civ and gives you a nice city that you didn't need to build.  Of course you will  get some diplomatic penalties, but if you can avoid meeting some civs then you shouldn't have any problems."
civ,3d3feu,Internet-Mana,6,Mon Jul 13 10:31:25 2015 UTC,From what I've learned from working up the ladder (I'm working on Immortal now) is a very efficient early game is crucial. You gotta close the gap on the lead the AI has. If the majority of the AI civs start to pull away from you in those first 200 turns (or whatever the normal speed equivalent is. I play on epic) then you will have a very difficult time getting back into the game. Watch some YouTube videos of Marbozir or Quill18 and see how they start their games. There are a number of viable starting strategies but the one constant is science is king. Priority number 1 is to close the science gap. At Emperor it still isn't too hard if you build your libraries and national college ASAP.
civ,3d3feu,asimpleenigma,3,Mon Jul 13 05:39:15 2015 UTC,"early science is secondary to a strong foundation.  getting those cities up and enough of an army (and unlocking composite bowmen) is key.  one has to settle enough cities to create choke points and spearhead cities that will be the ones attacked - and are well situated on terrain to repel a horde.  one mistake many make is early wonders.  only early wonder that is usually worth it imo is hanging gardens.  at the same time, one needs to make sure you don't kill happiness too early with too many settlers and don't spend too long building them, depriving your capitol of size (and competitive production).  I find 4 cities before turn 75 leads to a greater chance of a lackluster start then 2-3 cities does.  I often go for 2-3 cities initially, build the great college, then another 1-7 cities before turn 150 to close out holes."

When I was playing on Prince/King, I did a LOT of rerolls and studied the hell out of the early game. I'm not that good, but efficient enough that the step up to Emperor hasn't been so bad.  So I agree with asimpleenigma that an efficient opening is important."

civ,3d3feu,helloryan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"Science is really important for catching up. I'm going 4 city tall in most of my games. I'll copy part of a recent comment I made.   So as others said, science is everything. Learning how to prioritize science in the early game (and let go of some of the early wonders) is a lot of what helped me move from Prince to Emperor in a month. Early game should be about getting infrastructure up (and on higher difficulties catching up to the AI, but on Prince you're on equal footing). It's a good habit to get National College up by around turn 100, and to beeline techs that give you science buildings if you don't have a war or whatever to worry about. The science benchmarks I usually use for a tall empire are 200 science by turn 200, 500 science by turn 250, and 1000 science by turn 300. I haven't lost a game on Emperor when meeting those deadlines so adopting something similar should get you in a good spot.   In games where your start isn't great, do a little early game warmongering if you have to. In this game I only had two good starting city locations and my capital had stagnated due to lack of food tiles. To catch up, I took over Korea and annexed their cities. This gave me a huge science boost, and eliminated the most technological civ from the game. From there, I passed the AI in tech, and then went domination.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that internal trade routes can be great for growing your cities, which helps your science, production, and culture once specialists start doing their thing. If possible, you can also run all your external trade routes through the same city so it's easier to get the most bonuses on your routes from building bonuses as well as nearby resource bonuses."
civ,3d3feu,Chronos91,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:48:18 2015 UTC,"On the whole it's likely your micromanagement than your overall strategy. The best advice I can give you is to not force a strategy onto a start until you can breeze that difficulty level.    Work the right tiles for what your doing. Check cities every time they grow and ask yourself what you really need and how likely you are to achieve it. In general Food > *. More population means more science and production when it really matters. Watch where the governor puts new citizens, it will often try to throw them into the +2 gold slot on the market or something.  Forget early wonders on all but the most spectacular starts. The A.I starts with writing and a worker, you CANNOT beat it to great library or temple of Artemis unless something extraordinary happens. The A.I will have these wonders sub turn 20 sometimes.  Secure your borders as early as possible. For a tradition start try to follow the rule of 1.5 luxuries per city. For a liberty start (not recommended unless you really know what your doing) its about 1 to 1.2 luxes. Don't overextend, greed will often only get you the worst of all outcomes.  The best generic start build is Scout > Scout > Shrine (90% of the time, if not granary/worker) on a standard pangea or continents style map. Anyone who tells you otherwise is crazy or playing a civ with a unique building that replaces the shrine. Scouting wins games. I cannot overemphasize this enough. You get gold (or faith if your lucky) from meeting city states, you know where to settle and who your neighbours are. Use the gold to buy key tiles in your capitols and expands.  Once you have your initial cities down get your national college up asap. After that you can then assess what victory conditions you want to go for or have a reasonable chance of achieving."
civ,3d3feu,Hanare,8,Mon Jul 13 07:43:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm crazy then because I've never thought highly of the two scout start on most standard maps. By the time you've built that second scout, the number of undiscovered ruins/city states begins to dwindle. That extra scout costs you 1 gold per turn, and the 5-8 turns it took to build him could have gone towards a Monument or Worker.   Generally I use my starting Warrior to scout out a small loop around my area; if I find an enemy civ I'll try to steal his worker and run back to my city. The AI will almost always ask for peace after 10 turns and forget you ever declared war on them. Meanwhile my single scout creates a much larger loop around my area, trying to hug the coast lines if at all possible. I also use my first 200 gold to buy an archer to help defend the city worker while your warrior continues to scout. I've always found these two units to be more than sufficient on a standard sized map, but I can see the appeal of a second scout if it's on a larger map size."
civ,3d3feu,helloryan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:39:54 2015 UTC,"The higher the level you play the harder it'll be to get that civ to declare peace, as the higher level they are the more units they start with, thus making you look weak in their eyes unless you've only built units at the start.  Another benefit to getting scouts out is meeting city states and other civilizations.  City states will react to things you do and be freinds/allies, giving you huge boosts, even if you don't try to fill them.  Finding all the other civ's first gives you extra members in the world congress, which can be critical for that first vote."

civ,3d3feu,Drak_is_Right,0,Mon Jul 13 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"Tips for emperor on Epic pace:   AI gets Great Library around Turn 65-75 if you can get it before that it will boost your science enough to close initial tech gap. Hanging Gardens are completed around Turn 110 ( only once AI sneaked it at 93 in my games) Parthenon, Petra and Colossus ~140. Choose one. It's rare to get more without great engineer.   General tips:   If you can't get GL or you're playing wide, rush National College, best case get both and science gap no longer exists. Early efficiency is crucial. Steal worker from CS ASAP.  Get mining as 3rd, 4th tech. Upgrading hills and cutting forests provide shitton of production in early game. Cutting forests works great in a wonder race. If you get a jungle start - restart game. Emperor will snowball hard if you don't have enough production. AI starts with 4 bonus techs. Keep that in mind bee-lining wonders. Try to squeeze a settler between each wonder/2 buildings built. Early settlement will save your ass against forward settling AIs Liberty ain't bad. TRY it out, but you will need a monument early. First thing built is always a scout."
civ,3d3feu,LuvSpaghetti,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:39:24 2015 UTC,I've been playing forever and never beaten emperor. I think after my current game as the buccaneers I'll try and just get a win on emperor. Guess I'll go either Babylon or Korea (ugh) and try to just turtle up and win through science  But you say to reroll jungle starts. Does that apply to Brazil too?
civ,3d3feu,LibertarianSocialism,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:46:19 2015 UTC,"As someone that fell into the Brazil jungle trap when trying to beat Emperor, even for Brazil jungles are only good mid game and later. If you are in a sea of jungle with precious few production tiles to work you aren't going to make it to mid game. Early growth and production tiles are a must at higher difficulties."
civ,3d3feu,asimpleenigma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:16:11 2015 UTC,"I actually played (and won) my first Emperor game a few weeks ago, playing as Brazil. Basically every tile in my little part of the map (4 cities) was jungle, and I hardly chopped down any of them... I think it probably gave me a bad first impression of how difficult Emperor is. I have no idea how I won that game, though in the end I just got a science victory thanks to my endless jungle beakers because I couldn't be bothered to conquer the cultural runaways to get a tourism victory."

With all other mods, it's a case by case basis. Generally, More Civs civilizations stick out in terms of reliability ahead of the crowd, as do LastSword's. But as previously said, custom built civilizations built even by amazing modders such as JFD can inevitably have their downfalls (such as a weird bug with Tojo which I never figured out).

Uyghur and Sibir are nice Civs, but the former is very, very powerful and an absolute runaway. You can find the TSL patch for them in the YNAEMP thread along with all other Hiram mods. Anything by JFD is basically guaranteed to work. Leugi's mods are nicely designed but have some bugs in them that make then tentative to play with (Gran Colombia and Tiwinaku are victims to this). LastSwords mods should work really well Our World's China breaks the TSL on maps, but there's a fix available in the civfanatics thread.

civ,3d0fap,libfud,62,Sun Jul 12 13:21:40 2015 UTC,The AI will work a 1 Food 1 Hammer 2 Gold over a 3 Food 1 Hammer because Gold as miniscule as it is can be used to buy units/buildings hence Production.  The Production Focus in general is at least designed to maximize production now and doesn't take into account long term.  The best thing to do is to micro-manage yourself as you will always be smarter than an AI.
civ,3d0fap,Yurya,12,Sun Jul 12 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"I too find it strange that the governor tends to favor weak tiles, and, as you described in your edit, I found many a times that citizens would just remain unemployed when there are SO many tiles left to be worked.

civ,3d0fap,bitserve,36,Sun Jul 12 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"It isn't a bug; unemployed citizens provide +1 production, and when you put your city on production focus it just tries to work as many production tiles as possible without starving the city. Sometimes that includes several unemployed citizens."

Or not give them any production bonus at all.  I think the game is rewarding the civilization for city growth, but the way the mechanic is presented is certainly unintuitive."
civ,3d0fap,mechanicalpulse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"Well, Firaxis may have reasoned that the more common scenario that people would have is when enemy units occupy their city, preventing those tiles from getting worked.

civ,3d0fap,dromato,2,Sun Jul 12 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've had that bug. I find the way to reset it is to click the city centre so it resets all tiles to governors choice, and then re-lock each of them manually. It's a pain when you're in a 20+ pop city..."

civ,3d0fap,mymindpsychee,0,Sun Jul 12 14:37:21 2015 UTC,You can't lock tiles if you open the city screen while the AI is taking its turn. You have to close and reopen the city screen. Same with purchasing things with gold/faith.
civ,3d0fap,delfador,5,Mon Jul 13 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Best approach is to micromanage and work the tiles yourself. Also set yourself to production focus at all times. Food is processed by the game before production each turn, so if your city gets a new citizen that turn, the game will automatically have them work the highest production tile, giving you a few extra production for that turn."
civ,3d0fap,TheHaddockMan,8,Sun Jul 12 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I find the city 'govenor' to be one of the better parts of the AI. Sometimes you can leave a city on auto and it will approximately do the right thing.  However, overvaluing gold is definitely one of the bigger problems, as is overvaluing food for a small city. Undervaluing science specialists is the other biggie (gets better after +2/specialist policy)."

civ,3d0fap,TheHaddockMan,4,Sun Jul 12 20:26:35 2015 UTC,It is.  micromanaging your population is one of the biggest differences between being ok at the game (enough to sometimes win on king) and being good enough to win above emperor.
civ,3d0fap,delfador,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've only recently realised that. I can fairly easily win on King without microing but I'm about 50/50 on Emperor."
civ,3d0fap,Lunaticen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, agreed. It's really really important early on, before national college, and then again when you get universities. Becomes somewhat less so once the city gets larger and the era is later.  One way to get the hang of it: leave it on auto until you see something wrong, then switch to manual. Sometimes you'll get lucky and AI does a good job, other times need to almost fully babysit the city."

civ,3d0fap,mechanicalpulse,2,Mon Jul 13 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"The following is all pure conjecture from the mind of a software engineer that loves simulation modeling.  As long as a city is at least stagnant and GPT is at least at break even, the game probably sorts the remaining available tiles and specialist building slots by their aggregate yields (food+hammers+gold+science+culture+faith+GPP=aggregate).  That would easily explain Cerro de Petosi, but it doesn't explain your 1 food 1 hammer 2 gold (aggregate=4) vs 3 food 1 hammer (aggregate=4).  The aggregate yields in that situation are identical, so the sorting algorithm must choose one over the other.  What probably happens is that there is a separate sort comparison class, subroutine, or callback for each focus type.  Each one of these comparators probably rank each yield type differently in order to solve tiebreakers.  For production focus, it's probably gold > faith > culture > science > GPP > food, simply because gold and faith may be used to purchase items in the game, culture and science are used to achieve policies and technologies, GPP production is slow but steady, while food is not of benefit to the empire as a whole (unless you're shipping it out via caravans/cargo ships, which is somewhat of a rare occurrence).  If this is at all how the game implements the sorting algorithm for citizen selection, it would be fairly trivial to expose the yield type rankings to the user so that the user could create their own focus plans.  You could create your own ""Production & Food"" focus that would prefer hammers first, food second.  You could also enable a flag on each yield in the focus type editor that would allow you to ignore starvation and bankruptcy conditions (in other words, don't try to achieve stagnation or break-even first).  This could be useful in some cases where the production bonus is worth city starvation for a few turns (especially with aqueducts and high-yield tiles).  I don't particularly see the current implementation as bizarre, just limited insofar as micromanagement goes.  Just my $0.02."

civ,3d1jfl,fizzlefootie,21,Sun Jul 12 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, the jump from prince to king was the hardest. It's the step where you go from even ground to an AI bonus. Here are some basic rules that I follow for everything past prince:   Utterly important. Your first capital product should be a SCOUT maybe 2 possibly 3 depending on game speed and map size. Ruins can get you that extra tech or quick policy and really change the game. Small changes early on are the same as big change late game. Butterfly effect! Find a few natural wonders and you've got expendable happiness and a new city spot. It might seem counterintuitive to not build a granary or monument but scouts are far superior! They help you locate other city locations to settle as well. If you want a wonder on king or emperor, don't grab ancient/classical unless you have a clear advantage (30% or more). On immortal/deity, don't even try to get those. For other wonders, on king/emperor rush them! Still avoid wonders that the AI prioritizes (chichen itza) unless you have a clear advantage. On immortal/deity, avoid most wonders altogether. Maybe get one or two that are essential if you have a clear advantage. Otherwise, it's easier for you to take cities with the wonders! Build some defenses! Walls/castles become more and more important as you increase in difficulty. Don't build them immediately, but if you have some free production, get on it! Apart from that, build archers pretty immediately. A few should be enough to repel most ancient/classical attack on your cities. Set apart some of your time to build an army as time goes on. You should always make a point to be near the top of the army rating. Building important buildings won't matter if you lose your city! Units are much more important! Don't let a unit die on a whim! If you have a promotion and you have a chance of dying, heal heal heal! Otherwise think of all the production you just wasted having to build another unit. If you spawn near zulu/aztec/huns, restart. Just kidding! Prioritize your army! Archers are so so so important (and pretty OP for early defence). Keep enough of a standing army to avoid an attack, be as nice as possible unless they forward settle or some other bs. Rush to composite bowmen. Pay them to go to war with another civ. The huns will crumble after ancient Era if you have decent science and can stay ahead. The aztec can stay a very real threat for most of the game, so you might want to eliminate or cripple them early on! If you can forward settle and defend those cities, you're golden. If you can pay another civ to cripple them, you're golden. If you can stay ahead in science, you're golden. The Zulu are the single biggest game changers as neighbors. On king/emperor, you might get away with having a decent army and a decent tech lead. The zulu make very good friends. If they offer to go to war with someone, do it unless you have very good reason. They will love it! If they don't at least you have a tech lead, right? My favorite option for the zulu is to take them out before the infamous impi rush. You'll lag behind early on, but a second capital will keep you in the game. This strategy doesn't work as well for aztec/huns as they have very early game units and will build only those units! For attacking cities early on, you only need one melee unit to take a city. A bunch of archers/composite/horse archers will make quick work of a poorly defended city. Prioritize science! Every victory is related to science! You need better tech to make more money, have better armies, and get to national wonders and culture buildings sooner. Rules for great scientists in number 5. Try to get national college by turn 90-100. Refrain from settling if it'll set that back by 30 turns. Get a few research agreements and steal a few techs with spies. You gotta use everything you have at your disposal.  Really pay attention to how you earn and spend great people. A great general should only be converted to a citadel as a final stand. 100 impi, citadel. And if you have an option, place it on a strategic resource like iron, it'll work it for you! Does not work for luxury resources afaik. Otherwise a 15% bonus for up to ~15 units is huuuuge. Place academies early game and pop them for science later on. A scientist will give you as much science as your last 8 turns, so save them up and pop them 8 turns after you build all your public schools. Engineers almost always equal free wonders. As a safety, only build them in high production cities. Otherwise, the engineer might not speed it up to 1 turn. All culture based GP are purely situational, think about what you really want from them. Admirals rarely come in handy but when they do, treat them as generals. Only heal nearby units as a last stand. Be logical! Don't act on whims. You can't get away with much on higher difficulties. Make sure you're building your most important buildings early on while maintaining an army. Aim to have 3 or 4 cities, generally. You'll want to have these cities placed in good locations with a few luxes/strategics/bonuses by turn 140-150. Don't settle these cities within one tile of jungle if possible. It's a major setback and takes a long time work early game. If they're two or three away, they amount to science and can be very helpful with trading posts on top, but early on you need the food and you need the production.  Trade routes. They make a huge difference. Don't buy them unless they can pay themselves off in 30 turns! At least 10 gpt for land and 15 gpt for sea I believe. Get them early and make sure your routes are well protected! They're cost expensive and a loss is a huge setback. Don't route to a rival civ if they might declare war on you. Don't route through dangerous territory, keep a high defense unit nearby for encampment spawn. Steal a worker from a city state early game. Make sure not to accidentally attack them with your archer :) (use the move to option). Declare peace immediately and save 15-30 turns. Otherwise you'll have to build them or waste a policy that'll be better off getting you an earlier settler. Only do this once! Two and city states will start to declare eternal war as well as other civ warmonger repercussions. Micromanage tiles. You're smarter than the algorithms that decide city management. Make sure you place specialists when you want to prioritize. You might be able to get a few extra production per turn if you do this right. Know that the AI is the same as always. They aren't smarter, they are just gifted bonuses. They'll be stronger sure, but if you see yourself closing the score gap, you're doing everything right! Don't get discouraged! Have fun! Like really. If you're not having fun what's the point? And you'll definitely perform worse if you find yourself annoyed by the micromanaging. Take a few breaks and clear your mind. For the first few attempts, use auto saves and see how you can optimize your game. You'll learn to pick up on policy synergies and city build order. Hope I could help!   I'm no expert but these are my tips. If anyone has corrections or tips for me, please please comment."

civ,3d1jfl,Destroyer333,2,Fri Jul 17 00:43:12 2015 UTC,"A little unhappiness isn't too bad! Just make sure you settle near luxury resources that you can easily improve.

The national wonder gives 5 happiness if you have a colliseum in every city. Personally I prioritize stone/marble when settling to get that extra boost.

Not uncommon for my third or fourth city to make a lot of sacrifices in buildings in order to allow my primary two cities to grow faster.  play enough games on harder difficulties and you can start to fool around with the AIs, coming up with all sorts of little side things for fun (such as allowing the urge to go to war just because they are spreading a religion)."

It's your total tourism and culture that are used to calculate cultural influence. This cultural influence is then used to determine ideological influence.  Long bit  Note your cultural influence on another civ is determined by a comparison of your total tourism against their total culture. That is, going from 20 tourism per turn to 100 tourism per turn will make you earn tourism faster, but it won't necessarily immediately change your cultural influence.  For instance, you might have 500 tourism against Americas 1000 culture. Getting another 100 tourism per turn would make you catch up faster, but you're still behind for another 5 turns (assuming America earns 0 culture which is highly unlikely).  You might note that I talked about cultural influence, not ideological influence. The tourism-vs-culture ratio gives you a level of influence over the other civ. The levels are at 10% (so 100 tourism to 1000 culture), 30% (300 tourism to 1000 culture), 60%, 100% and one at 200%. Each level of influence gives you a certain number of small bonuses.  Ideological influence is calculated on a per-ideology basis (not per-civ like cultural). For each level of cultural influence another civ has over you, their ideology gains one level of ideological influence. These are directly countered by levels of influence you have over their civ.  For example, if you are 35% influential over America, you gain 2 levels of order influence. However, they could also be 65% influential over you so they gain 3 levels of freedom influence. That means that you currently have a 1 level of influence towards freedom. Repeat this for each civ (and sum up influences for the same ideology) and it's easy to see how a small cultural influence from many civs can lead to a huge ideological influence."

Because as soon as Delhi lost the resistance, it started giving me an extra 100 culture which completely negated America's exotic influence over me. It's falling now and the unhappiness penalty is finally gone. Thanks for the help, I'm definitely not going to neglect culture even if I'm going for a domination victory."

civ,3d368w,asimpleenigma,6,Mon Jul 13 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"Are Ancient/Classical era UUs kinda wasted (with exception to Huns) at high difficulty levels since you spend most of those eras trying to catch up?   IMO, yes. The Huns and perhaps Assyria are the only exceptions that come to mind. Composite bowmen are the best unit to use in those eras. Some of the melee UU's are decent support, though, like the spearman upgrades (Greece, Persia, Celts).  The real issue is that most UU's are melee, and melee is very undervalued at high difficulties. It's all about range and siege units, at least until the Infantry line comes into play. That's why the best UU's are all ranged/siege: Mongolia, Arabia, China, England, Huns."
civ,3d368w,delfador,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:17:14 2015 UTC,"composite bowmen are the best in those eras   I would say chariots. One less strength, sure, but the higher movement is great, along with the lower production cost"
civ,3d368w,jamesabe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, they can definitely work in some situations. Downsides however:   you need to have horses you need to use those horses instead of trading, which means 2 gpt less per chariot no defensive terrain bonus and spearman vulnerability makes them a good bit more squishy when attacking you can make archers and upgrade to composites, which saves valuable early hammers and makes the rush much quicker   That said, I would totally use chariots as Mongolia or Arabia. Get a head start on the promotions."
civ,3d368w,delfador,2,Fri Jul 17 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"Wasted if you're looking to conquer but if you're concentrating on building up your empire, economy and infrastructure then strong melee UUs like Hoplites or Legions will allow you to keep a smaller army in terms of units and concentrate on other things"
civ,3d368w,crt134,2,Mon Jul 13 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"Early UUs still help with dealing with barbs and surviving extracting stolen workers. I have a video on youtube where I was playing as the Celts.

If you have a few flatland city states around you, prioritize getting 2 or 3 spearman and go make rounds asking for tribute.  If you are able to buy a worker with the gold, building the spearman pays for itself in production.  It's a bit situational because of the need for flatland non hostile cs, but still can be done in most games."

civ,3d0gre,davidi,4,Sun Jul 12 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"absolutely. You get diplomatic bonuses for sharing a majority religion, or change religions to collect faith buildings. When going for cultural in diety, if you can't spread your religion it can be necessary to adopt an opponents religion to become influential. It all has to be balanced against the advantage you give them for the founder belief, but the really religious civs often went piety and aren't as powerful as their tradition/liberty counterparts"
civ,3d0gre,TheAlmightyBob,2,Sun Jul 12 18:23:45 2015 UTC,If there are no good beliefs left and there's a close neighbour with a good religion then it's worth abandoning it entirely and not even getting the prophet (or using him for a holy site). The AI will often go piety and have access to mcuh stronger beliefs than you would anyway. (Such as Jesuit education).  Sharing a religion is a strong diplo modifier so that's something else to consider.  Unless I have a really strong chance of getting a religion (natural wonder or loads of a resource with a faith based pantheon) I just go for something generic and abandon the idea of getting a religion from the start.
civ,3d0gre,yen223,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:16 2015 UTC,Yup. Holy sites are better than getting 4th religion.

civ,3czamk,DrBigBlack,37,Sun Jul 12 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"For those of you that aren't familiar with Scramble for Africa as the Zulu, this is one of the most difficult Civs to play through on this Scenario. The reason being, is the Zulu are so far behind everyone technologically (you're using trebuchets while everyone has cannons and you can't build any culture building past the Ampitheather), you're sandwiched in between two powerhouse European civs. They hate you and will wipe you out by turn 30. Also, if you have the perfect start and everything goes well it can all be for naught as Ethiopia becomes a run away and there's nothing you can do about it. Each map type will be different when you start a game. Most are flat and open which means you won't make it it past turn 30. You can get a good mountainous map but unless it's perfect, the insane amount of production the AI has means they can just keep sending units until they wear you down, so you need the perfect start. That being said here's a few things that are applicable to most Zulu starts.  Citadels the most important thing in this game. You first priority should be the Great General so you can place your citadel on that Iron next to Ulundi. When you get that free great person, use it on the Great General. You can never get enough citadels. Place them near chokepoints.  Try to get a few crossbowman going. 4-5 should do and don't lose them. As for the Impis, even though they're weak and easy to produce, don't treat them as dispensable. There will be a few times when you'll have to sacrifice them.  Learn how to use the Zone of Control It can save you a lot of units   Most of your points will be gained from destroying other units. You need a war with Portugal and England if you want to win.  The reason I sent an Impi up North to meet the Ethiopians and Egyptians is so that I can bribe others to declare war on the Ethiopians (Egypt will do it for cheap and they are usually better at hurting the Ethiopians than the Europeans) and so that I can trade resources for GPT (the Europeans won't give you fair deals). At a certain point you will be losing a lot of money and seeing an Impi disappear every turn.  I would knock out that Portuguese city next to Ulundi as quickly as possible, it's next to your city and it'll just churn out units faster than you can handle.  When a unit is killed by a citadel you won't receive any points for it so you want to time your attacks so you will have the finishing blow, for example there are Two Ship of the Lines, one is 50 health and the other is 80. They are both next to a citadel, and your units can do 40 damage. Attack the 80 health Ship of the Line, you'll bring it down to the 40. Next turn the citadel would have brought them both down to 20 and 10, you can wipe them both out and gain culture for two kills.. If you initially attack the 50 health, it'll be brought to 20 and the citadel will destroy it without giving you any culture. The 80 with be 50, you attack it to bring it down to 10 and next turn that one is destroyed by the citadel and you gain no culture for either ship."
civ,3czamk,giggles132,6,Sun Jul 12 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing these this seems like a fun scenario, but I have one question.  In all of your games you kill Ethiopia or try to or hurt them, why is it that Ethiopia gets the highest score in all of your games?"
civ,3czamk,giggles132,14,Sun Jul 12 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"All but three I completely wiped them out. The Boers and Zulu, I didn't touch them. The Belgians I just took everything and left them with one city which was good enough. In most playthroughs they need to be wiped out.   The sub-saharan civs (Zulu, Boers, Ethiopia) all get their points from culture. Because of that their culture just keeps growing at a steady pace. For the European and North African civs the highest they usually obtain is around 4000 points.  The sub-saharans can get above 6000. What makes Ethiopia the biggest threat is that they are completely isolated and hard to get to. They are surrounded by jungle, hills, and sometimes mountains. By the time anyone can send a decent sized army towards them, it's already turn 60. The powerhouses like Portugal or England can only settle a city or two close by mid way in the game. The Boers and Zulu, however, are surrounded by the English and Portuguese, they get wiped out quickly. If left alone the scores would always be 1. Boers 2. Ethiopia 3. Zulu."

It will sometimes incur a diplo penalty, though. So be careful if you're next to someone like the Huns."
civ,3d0bbv,darthreuental,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:48:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on what the other civs are. Some, I think, tend to go Tradition. I've had games where Denmark and Babylon beat me to Hanging Gardens."
civ,3d0bbv,libfud,2,Mon Jul 13 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"I think the Hanging Gardens is really overrated. You can get the same with a granary (which you want anyway) and a cargo ship in the early game, which gives more and more food as you go on. Of course, you could stack these effects anyway, and if you don't have a coastal capital that doesn't work. But you're going to face really stiff competition for it, and if someone like, say, Gandhi is in the game, you can pretty much forget about it. 250 hammers for HG vs 100 for a cargo ship, 60 for a granary, and 120 for the garden works out to a total of 280, or 12% higher total cost but for food that increases as the game goes on, the granary that you'd want in the city to begin with, and getting the garden in your capital that many turns sooner. Plus, you also don't get the malus of ""you built wonders they covet,"" because I'm positive that any and every AI that goes tradition is going to gun for it.  Contrast this with Petra and the Colossus which give you an additional trade route, or Leaning Tower of Pisa, which gives +25% great person generation in all cities and a free great person, or the Porcelain Tower which gives 25% more science out of a RA. Those wonders have effects that you either can't duplicate or are a really great use of hammers."
civ,3d0bbv,skysbringer,2,Sun Jul 12 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"I play for a science based domination victory, going Order, so for me, every bit of extra food helps. My strategy hinges on Alhambra and Brandenburg, so it's imperative for me to get as much science as possible in the early stages of the game - the Hanging Gardens is incredible for this. It also frees up a caravan or cargo ship for me to trade with the AI - 3-5 extra science per turn early on is nothing to sneeze at.  To be honest, I usually don't bother going Liberty in the first place, simply because Tradition scales so powerfully into the later stages of the game. Liberty gives a lot of immediate benefits - immediate worker, settler, great person - but falls off quite hard.   You're completely right about the diplo penalties, and I addressed it in another comment as well."
civ,3d0bbv,yen223,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"Hanging Gardens are a great wonder. Early growth is always good.  The problem is that in higher AI difficulty games, you cannot realistically build it without incurring some massive opportunity cost."
civ,3d0bbv,schootsta,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:00:01 2015 UTC,"With hanging gardens you can much more easily work high production tiles while the city wont starve....this can often make the difference between getting a wonder or not in the following eras....obviously the extra growth can also be very useful for your science and being able to assign more specialists faster....also the free garden is great, especially in cities where you woulnt have been able to build a garden otherwise"
civ,3d0bbv,yen223,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:54 2015 UTC,"The key point is that you get your 3rd Liberty policy faster going pure Liberty. Which means faster Collective Rule.  So the choice is whether you'll get strong tiles in the capital, or stronger tiles in your new cities from earlier settlers. If you're committed to a Liberty strategy, you'd want better city placements with faster settlers."
civ,3d0bbv,6180339887,6,Mon Jul 13 02:48:03 2015 UTC,"When you play liberty you NEED that settler asap, so I'd say it's not worth it."

Otherwise, it's likely not worth it."
civ,3d0bbv,yen223,2,Sun Jul 12 18:20:47 2015 UTC,There is one more downside to opening Tradition - you'll end the game with one less social policy.   You're essentially paying something like 1400 culture to get back 1200 culture - obviously not worth it.
civ,3d0bbv,cazadero,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"I know its counter-intuitive, but for playability sake, I like to open tradition, then liberty, then honor (for the culture bonus and fun), then finish up the liberty branch.

civ,3d33ve,zlolslavez,3,Mon Jul 13 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"You probably know that emperor is the last difficulty that this will work on. Even then, Petra is very situational! I most always have all(or at least the first 3 cities) settled by 150. You'll want the nat college built somewhere between your 2nd and 4th city placement. If settling is gonna set back the national college by 30-40 turns, wait to settle until the college. As for the wonders, sure they're great but if there is a chance of you not getting them, then consider yourself shot in the foot. Artemis is the safest early on imo, or if you need Petra get some embassies and weigh your options because you need to be next to desert. If you want Petra you have to rush it. Gardens are usually prioritized so I avoid them every time to be safe.   And I'm definitely still tweaking my religion strat but especially on immortal/deity don't build a shrine unless you have a very good reason. God king is usually not a good enough reason for me to waste the turns. Spend this time building a scout, a monument if you're going liberty, or stealing a CS worker.  Finally, I would Def be building a settler before I get anywhere near 500 dollars. Unless you find a bunch of cs, get your trade routes going, or find El Dorado, you might want to be building settlers earlier rather than later. On higher difficulties your favorite spot might just belong to greece before you can get to it.  Best of luck!"
civ,3d33ve,Destroyer333,3,Mon Jul 13 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"You are definitely settling too late. Temple of Artemis is great, but you really should almost never get it on higher difficulties because you are getting ciites. Out"
civ,3d33ve,jamesabe,3,Mon Jul 13 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"Depending on your starting lands, the expands you've identified, and how close/aggressive your neighbors are, you should be building a Settler at 3-4 pop most games. I often string 2-3 Settlers together to get my borders established. Sometimes I'll hard build a Worker after 1st Settler if I'm having difficulties acquiring a free one just so I have some semblance of happiness along the way.  For me, the game doesn't start until your borders are established and NC is up. There's no sense in chasing after early game wonders when you won't be able to get them on higher difficulties. Most of them you can just take anyways and get most if not all of the benefits."
civ,3d1hlr,SOMMARTIDER,5,Sun Jul 12 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Don't know what you're doing, but it sounds like it's just like you're having trouble adjusting to the tougher aspects of the higher level.  I know when I first went to immortal it was a big spike in difficulty and what I was doing on Emperor just wasn't going to work, and it went much like you're describing; I couldn't conquer fast enough when going domination, couldn't defend myself when going science or cultural, and I couldn't make enough money to support a diplomatic run.  What worked for me was adding a lot of the advice on starts you can find on this subreddit.  Even if you're wanting to go wide, hold your expansion until you get your national college up, and focus on getting it built by turn 100ish on standard.  Don't build/buy a worker; steal one from a CS or an AI.  And if you happen to find your neighbor's first settler wandering off unescorted, steal it too.  Stealing that settler absolutely cripples the AI and will make it so much easier for you to destroy them, or treat them like a vessel for the rest of the game.  Plus, those early wars don't impact diplomacy much, in particular if all you do is take some civilian units.  If they're one-shotting your units then you're laying siege with units that are too weak for the era your target is in.  Although I love when I can have a leveled up catapult because a 4 range, double attacking artillery piece, the archer units are just so much better for early war.  They can take more damage, be built faster, and move and shoot in one turn which allows you to start your siege faster.  Finally, don't neglect your military when going for a science or cultural victory.  Your Babylon attempt that got shit on shouldn't really matter how many cities the AI spammed.  It's only a problem if they're using the cities to produce units that them overwhelm you.  But if you have a strong enough army (not the best, but try for top 1/3) it keeps them from declaring war on you.  Even if they have the strength to steam roll you if they wanted, just that rating keeps them from usually doing it.  Just my wall of text."

civ,3d1hlr,kingp1ng,3,Mon Jul 13 01:16:14 2015 UTC,"You'll never win the early game. It's a strategic game of catch up. Growth, security, and more growth!  Temple of Artemis is usually my go-to wonder. Imo, all the others aren't worth the build time. Aim for national college since the AI sucks at building wonders where you need ""x building in all cities.""  Composite bowmen are a HUGE power spike. You can tech up your military up to comp bowmen and then focus on the other science/culture research. 6 composite bowmen placed on key positions can defend well. Unfortunately if I face someone like Shaka or Genghis Khan I just restart. There's no way you can fend off their zerg rush unless there are some lucky chokepoints.  Don't be friends with any of your neighbors. If you can steal their workers or delay their expansion without dying yourself, do it.  Get the Oracle. It's not that high on the AI's priority. Hanging Gardens is godlike if you can get it. You can focus on production while growing well.  Go try liberty. It gives you a nice early game boost. I love tradition, but it's advantages are sometimes too slow."

You'll likely have a bunch of lag during CS turns and barbarian turns as well (Barbarians can have hundreds of units to move). Turn on quick combat/movement. This will speed AI turns. Turn down graphics to minimim. Play strategic view as soon as errors start coming in. Be sure to differentiate lag from processing.

That way we can have our 300 Spartans hold the same chokepoint but getting more than a single set of trebuchets on a narrow hill takes some serious commitment to the cause.

You should probably go straight for Citizenship, pop out a few settlers, and get a 3-5 city NC. The last couple cities settled should probably build a library first (work a food+production tile to grow to 2 pop meanwhile, then full production focus). Afterwards you can settle cities wherever you can/need/want. Keep in mind the liberty tree can't fully support you through the late game."

civ,3d04b5,DushkuHS,2,Sun Jul 12 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"It depends. I've had games where I could get out 5-6 cities before NC. It depends on gold (do I have enough to rush buy 0, 1, or 2 Libraries?). It depends on how fast you're building settlers. And so on.  In games where I've identified like 10 expands, then I will use Liberty GE to rush NC. Otherwise, an Academy is better.  When I'm playing Liberty, I tend to early game expand build order Monument, Shrine, Library. If I don't have money for a Library, then my last expand before NC will be Library first and the expand before that will be Monument Library. Or if I have money for a Library, my last expand will buy a Library, 2nd to last builds Library first, 3rd to last builds Monument Library.  Try different things and see what works best for you.

civ,3czfz7,Eldis,25,Sun Jul 12 12:31:54 2015 UTC,"I guess it's like any diplomatic discussion. If you tell another country not to do something, it's going to piss them off. I have no idea about the mechanics (whether it actually does anything or not) though. But from experience, when another civ tells me not to settle near their land, and I do anyway, it usually leads to war being declared."
civ,3czfz7,kingp1ng,15,Sun Jul 12 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"If you tell another country not to do something, it's going to piss them off.    It does work, though. I often say this to AI's and they will retreat their settler especially if you have a military unit around the area they're trying to send that settler to. Saves you a lot of diplomacy with other ai's since you don't need to declare a war to prevent an enraging settle."
civ,3czfz7,RetrogMGXII,2,Sun Jul 12 12:39:02 2015 UTC,I suppose I'll stay away from it for the time being then. Thanks!
civ,3czfz7,PCGamerUnion,9,Sun Jul 12 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"You can see all your diplomacy ""levels"" on the top right menu. Click on the globe icon and hover over another AI civ. It'll tell you things the AI appreciated (green color) and things the AI hated (red color).  I didn't know this feature for 2 whole years. It helps a LOT.  The ""don't settle new cities near us"" demand depends on your friendship level. I think that if you are neutral or lower, it pisses them off. If you are at friendly, they simply ignore the demand. If you are at friendship, they will say OK (probably a lie). I never use this demand because I think it's useless. The AI hardly ever listens to you (or anything rational)  The same goes with ""Don't spy on me"". It doesn't do anything. Even if the AI accepts your demand, it'll just continue settling/spying."
civ,3czfz7,krazyhades,4,Sun Jul 12 06:39:00 2015 UTC,Demands are always negative. And don't really work unless you have a really large army to back up your words. And the ai is really forgetfull of your demands so saying it before you see setllers is usless. But when you see a settler near you it can work. I have used it once on an ai and he send his settler else where. This was however on a lower difficulty where having a larger army is very easy. But it might be usefull agains someone like polynesia who sends settlers to all places where there is available coast. But remember you need a stronger army and it might work so no garantees. It is a demand so it will piss off that ai so I usually stay away from using them.
civ,3czfz7,BuckRampant,4,Sun Jul 12 09:32:14 2015 UTC,you can make that demand if the AI is afraid of your army or if you have much better diplomatic relations than them. It will always piss them off however.
civ,3czfz7,Procitizenkane,3,Sun Jul 12 09:14:54 2015 UTC,"If you promise to stop settling near, and break that promise, you get flagged as a backstabber. Demanding the AI players stop settling near you is useless. It's basically just for the AI to demand it of YOU. And it's generally a really bad idea to break your word because of the diplomatic penalties, so if you really do plan to settle near them more, say so."
civ,3czfz7,Muffinking15,2,Sun Jul 12 16:44:14 2015 UTC,It has only ever worked for me when they can see that I have a settler.
civ,3czw97,SOMMARTIDER,17,Sun Jul 12 08:10:57 2015 UTC,"Generally civs will go for the victory type they are designed for but when they can only win by domination then they will focus on that instead. More units, more war, more chaos.  Same thing would happen if you only had culture victory on. You would see Atilla rushing musicians guild and Louvre."

civ,3czw97,Stedfastwolf,2,Sun Jul 12 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"I have a domination only game going on right now that's interesting. I'm doing highlands with normal size ridge lines on prince and it seems weird. I did 12 Civs on a standard map and only 11 city-states spawned. In the early game, the only wonders I lost were those I didn't go for. I even got wonders that I barely tried for. I'm blocked in with one tile passes that allows my units out and makes invasions hard. Even with one of the smallest armies, no ai has declared war on me. There are wars going on but the only loss of cities has been done by myself and Byzantium who is my friend. Also all but 3 Civs left have at least 3 friends. Generally they should go more for war though."
civ,3czw97,dizigma_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"My current game is domination only and it's pretty insane. Literally every civ hates every other one, there are no alliances, they all ended in a series of backstabs starting in the industrial era. Also everyone picked autocracy"
civ,3czw97,PCGamerUnion,2,Sun Jul 12 21:50:33 2015 UTC,I am playing a domination only game right now and the world ideology is Order. Because you need order to maintain an empire of 50 fucking cities.
civ,3d3c9e,mrgbow,5,Mon Jul 13 04:47:10 2015 UTC,"Barbs can be your friends. In my current game (which I'm making a video of), I got a free worker from a barb camp that originally belonged to La Venta. Many turns later, I had one too many workers, so I took that specific worker and dangled it in front of a barb Horseman. He took it. I killed him and gave the worker back for instant rep. Then the Pikeman in the camp came out and stole the worker again. I killed it and returned the worker AGAIN.  So... I killed a unit in the original camp, cleared the camp, and returned their worker twice (after getting hella work out of it). LOTS of rep. Thank you, barbs.  The trick is that once you've scouted enough to identify your expands, bring your Scouts back long enough to help protect/steal your worker(s) and assist your Warrior in escorting your Settlers. Once your borders are established, built a couple Archers and have your Scouts resume uncovering the map. Kill camps near you for rep, gold, and possibly more workers.  There are times when you're getting overrun by like 3 camps at once. In those cases, you should build another Warrior early. Otherwise, the barbs are often your friends. The only dick move they do that bugs me is when they stick to your Warrior so he only gets to move one tile at a time."

civ,3cyblr,MildlyAgitatedBidoof,2,Mon Jul 13 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"First step is learning how to reverse engineer stuff. This is key. This is how'll you do most of the learning. Notepad++ will help you a lot.  Second, Firaxis has a weird way of editing files that allows you to literally see what is going on. Files are available somewhere in the Steam CiV Files.  Third, CivFanatics had a guy compile the Civs, Buildings, Units and many others into a single file. Check that out.  Fourth, download stuff such as JFD's mods and try to understand the coding in it.  Give me an example of what you want to do, and I will give you a path of what to do."
