ethereum,3e5h1q,yoitsaantonop,12,Wed Jul 22 02:42:49 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing our market cap should surpass Bitcoin's by the end of the first week of trading.   I'd bet against that. If only we had some trustless means of betting on  future outcomes!   Seriously, I think we should make a valiant effort now to stop this sub from becoming /r/bitcoin. I honestly think price talk should be banned as it's not worth the risk of this sub degenerating into /r/bitcoin. What matters about Ethereum is that it's a sort of lego for incentive structures. On /r/lego people talk more about what they build than what the market cap of Lego is. People on /r/ethereum should try to do the same and leave price speculation for Augur once it's launched and other subs for now."
ethereum,3e5h1q,Lyle_Cantor,2,Wed Jul 22 03:34:31 2015 UTC,"Monetized speculation is inevitable. Any attempts at banning it is futile.  Our social outlets need to accept this, plan for, and evolve accordingly, to avoid the same degeneration as /r/bitcoin.  While it's extremely noble to want a sub like /r/lego, it's completely unrealistic to expect that to happen within our lifetime. Anyone from 5-95yrs old can construct and communicate about their love of Lego, but a very small fraction of people know how or are coding dapps.  Wishful thinking < reality"

Monetizing the reward, especially at such a monumental scale, is inevitable and will draw speculator.

ethereum,3e5h1q,heltok,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:04:07 2015 UTC,"I think your being a bit optimistic. Ether will have to go to a price of $50+ to pass out bitcoin.  People funded the project at about 25-32 cents per Ether.  So my guess would be a launch price of around $0.70 to $1 per Ether which would be a 300% profit if the initial investor was to sell.  I would guess some people would sell 25% of there Ether to cover there investment and be left with free Ethers. Also people have been waiting 12 months to get at their money  But who knows, the price will be what the market thinks they are worth and/or how long it takes Wall Street to realize What Ethereum really is (evolution)"
ethereum,3e5h1q,TonyMcCarp,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"So my guess would be a launch price of around $0.70 to $1 per Ether    Wait, so you're saying the price would drop from it's approximate $2.30/ether value? http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethercoin/  (Yes, I realize that ethercoin is not exactly ether, but they are similar if you look at how ethercoin was created.)"

ethereum,3e5h1q,anthony334,5,Wed Jul 22 05:01:59 2015 UTC,IMO ethercoin is pretty useless to predict ether price. Anonymous devs could pump that to any price they want.
ethereum,3e5h1q,getrektcrew,3,Wed Jul 22 05:18:00 2015 UTC,MMMmm there is 1 million Ethercoins at $2  When the real Ether launch there will be 60 million coins available for trade  So Yes I see the drop to $1 as a possibility
ethereum,3e5h1q,TonyMcCarp,2,Wed Jul 22 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"The devs don't hold Ethercoin though do they? They don't even profit from trading volume. If I understand correctly, the devs made their money selling the original Ethercoins at a profit compared to what they paid for their 1 million Ether.   I take the view that Ethercoin represents a good indicator of Ether value because any scarcity of Ethercoins that might positively skew the price is balanced by both the availability of the OTC pre-market, and the trust issues, which negatively skew the price.   Ether at $3 shortly after launch seems a distinct possibility to me, given Ethercoin recently traded as high as $2.36. $5-10 is perfectly possible during 2015, because I suspect that Ethereum will surpass Ripple in expected value during that period."
ethereum,3e5h1q,templar422,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, it's just the opposite, the devs sell the ethercoin as a token with a promise to give you ether at launch. Think of it like a shitcoin with a 100% premine. So they still hold the majority of ethercoin. And even if that isn't the case, there'd be no way to know that they don't hold the vast majority anyway (i.e., bought it from themselves). Therefore, it would only benefit them to buy their own ethercoin and pump the price up. There is no way to know how many people outside the devs have purchased ethercoin so I don't see how it can indicate anything at all."

The pyethsalestool was not meant for dumb people like me who forget to write their passwords down.  Basically every time you wanted to check a password you needed to copy paste a command line string then enter in your password and then interpret a result (don't think all errors are the same).  This tool allows for the following:   Check hundreds of passwords all in one go Allows you to have one file which keeps track of all the past attempts you made if you are still unsuccessful No interpretation of errors required either it spits out a private key beginning with 5 or it spits out a *   If you forget your password then:   Keep calm Use this tool Be happy   ~J

ethereum,3dz7ts,johnmountain,4,Mon Jul 20 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"Current spec, which will probably change:  https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Argon-v2.pdf  From page 4:   Our solutions. We offer two new hashing scheme called Argon and Argon2. Argon is our original submission to PHC. It is a multipurpose hash function, that is optimized for highest resilience against tradeoff attacks, so that any, even small memory reduction would lead to significant time and computational penalties. Argon can be used for password hashing, key derivation, or any other memory-hard computation (e.g., for cryptocurrencies).  Argon2 summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions. It is a streamlined and simple design. It aims at the highest memory filling rate and effective use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense against tradeoff attacks. Argon2 is optimized for the x86 architecture and exploits the cache and memory organization of the recent Intel and AMD processors. Argon2 has two variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d is faster and uses data-depending memory access, which makes it suitable for cryptocurrencies and applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and passwordbased key derivation. Argon2i is slower as it makes more passes over the memory to protect from tradeoff attacks.  We recommend Argon for the applications that aim for the highest tradeoff resilience and want to guarantee prohibitive time and computational penalties on any memory-reducing implementation. According to our cryptanalytic algorithms, an attempt to use half of the requested memory (for instance, 64 MB instead of 128 MB) results in the speed penalty factor of 140 and in the penalty 218. The penalty grows exponentially as the available memory decreases, which effectively prohibits the adversary to use any smaller amount of memory. Such high computational penalties are a unique feature of Argon. We recommend Argon2 for the applications that aim for high performance. Both versions of Argon2 allow to fill 1 GB of RAM in a fraction of second, and smaller amounts even faster. It scales easily to the arbitrary number of parallel computing units. Its design is also optimized for clarity to ease analysis and implementation.   EDIT: Another interesting tidbit:   Argon2 is heavily optimized for the x86 architecture, so that implementing it on dedicated cracking hardware should be neither cheaper nor faster. Even specialized ASICs would require significant area and would not allow reduction in the time-area product.   It's also resistant to GPUs."

Therefore, PoW is not a good prevention against vote spam, though you can use it to prevent commenting spam).  That's not good.  You prevent ""spam"" by casual users who don't register multiple names, but you leave open a gaping hole for dedicated spammers.    I too wanted to stay away from paid usage.

ethereum,3dvfgz,ItsAConspiracy,11,Sun Jul 19 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"You can design PoS systems where nodes are running at close to 100% capacity without running into centralization risks, so it certainly can give you perhaps a 5x boost.

ethereum,3dvfgz,bobthesponge1,4,Mon Jul 20 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"True, but then that's a hybrid PoS system already."
ethereum,3dvfgz,vbuterin,2,Mon Jul 20 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"You can design PoS systems where nodes are running at close to 100% capacity without running into centralization risks,   Is this telling us that the current experiment showed that PoW is mainly running into centralization?  The section 11.5. Mining Proof-of-Work of your YP gives an idea that PoW was well-researched by taking into consideration a holistic approach to avoid centralization. Now it turns that it's not really the case at all.   It seems that Ethereum drafts are not backed by any strong scientific evidence and their contents are subject to rejection any time?"
ethereum,3dvfgz,HardToScale,4,Mon Jul 20 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"The PoW completely was designed to minimize centralization risk. However, there is a natural problem (and I have mentioned this before many times) that when load gets too high, centralization risk increases because (1) it pays much more to be closer to the dominant cluster of mining nodes, and (2) weak nodes can't keep up with the network. Ethereum's uncle algo does help mitigate this problem, but even it has limits, which start to appear once computers are spending more than 10% of the time processing transactions (with the default ethereum gas limit, it's well under 10% so don't worry). Saying that this means our PoW research failed is like saying that fuel efficiency research failed because cars still can't go across Asia without refueling. With PoS, on the other hand, we can design ""round robin"" protocols that explicitly set a sequence and timing of validators, so you can have ultrafast block times and have computers spend close to 100% of the time processing transactions without running into as much centralization risk. And with scalability, cars can go to the moon before they need to refuel :)"
ethereum,3dvfgz,vbuterin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"PoS will have also the same issues,  different parts of the network are handling different ideas ( forks, for instance) about which blockchain  is the most canonical while the update  is still flowing through  the network ... specially as you mention,  ""ultrafast block times"".   I'm mainly concerned also about  the lack of the difficulty concept in PoS.  Using PoS, forks are random facts to deal with  in a distributed network, note that PoW determines  a canonical blockchain by using the difficulty concept ( longest, or more work are based on the difficulty concept). To reach a consensus, which is the most important point of having a secure mining process,  is PoS more robust than PoW to define the canonical blockchain at any given time?"

Actually, now that I think about it the miner support channel is definitely one of the busiest on Skype.  Mining is without a doubt incredibly important in terms of network security, for me though it's just kind of not the thing to be most excited about when it comes to Ethereum.

ethereum,3dvfgz,etherminer24,0,Mon Jul 20 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"Not true at all.  Are you trying to lie to people on purpose?  42,000 ETH per day.  There were about 300 GPUs online during olympic at the peak.  If you run the program with 300GPUs on the network you'll earn 140 ether per day.  If you run the program with 1 GPU when 42,000 other GPUs are on the network, you'll earn 1 ETH per day.     So, there's room for 42,000 people each with 1 GPU to earn 1 ETH per day.  You don't need a powerful rig at all for free ethers.  Please stop lying on this subreddit"
ethereum,3dvfgz,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that to use a GPU to mine, it must have 2-3GB of RAM, which puts it in the hundreds of dollars range. You also must have a decent PC (good CPU, fast HD/SSD, good internet) to keep up with the network. So right off the bat the minimum investment to mine is hundreds of dollars. If you plan on just CPU-mining, you would earn less than 0.01 Eth/day on average, with weeks passing by before finding a block.  You whole argument is that PoW brings users into the ecosystem. Basically, people mine to make a profit (and some for hobby). Compare this to PoS, where part of the reason people stake is as a savings account, since it gains interest and they can cash out at any time. You could think of mining as a ""savings"" account, but it isn't as good because you have to sell the hardware to cash out, which rapidly loses value. And there is much less of a guarantee to make up the cost of mining compared to PoS, since the initial cost of PoS is any amount of ether plus a standard PC/laptop which an ethereum user must have anyway. So for the average user, PoS is more accessible because they can invest any amount they wish and don't have to know anything about mining/hardware.   We are also trying to build a compelling platform, and scalability is a huge component of that. If someone forks ethereum and makes it more scalable, application developers might migrate to that one. Users will be attracted to the system with the most compelling applications on it, so scalability definitely is a factor in user base. So we should put servicing applications as a high priority if we want to grow the network.   So not only is your argument that PoW attracts more users than PoS debatable, the scalability concern makes PoS seem a better bet in growing the user base. Ethereum is getting the best of both worlds perhaps, since it does have an initial mining phase, but I want to see PoS as soon as possible."
ethereum,3dvfgz,etherminer24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:47 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that to use a GPU to mine, it must have 2-3GB of RAM, which puts it in the hundreds of dollars range.    This is wrong. 2GB GPUs have been standard for 3 years.  They currently cost less then $100.   So for the average user, PoS is more accessible because they can invest any amount they wish and don't have to know anything about mining/hardware.   This is wrong also.  There are more barriers to PoS. You have to buy Bitcoin, and then you need to find an ethereum exchange, open an account, and do the purchase.  All this compared to to just running a program on your computer for free ether.  PoS is only good for scalability when we need it. Early on PoW is much better for bootstrapping."
ethereum,3dvfgz,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"Well, with Ethereum's hashing algorithm, Ethash, the GPU RAM needed grows over time. It will be over 2GB about 1.25 years after the fronteir launch. So if you want a GPU to last longer than that, you need 3GB or more. Also, IMO, the smallest GPU with a reasonable chance of being profitable (accounting for cost and electricity) is the AMD 260x, which is $129.    There are more barriers to PoS. You have to buy Bitcoin, and then you need to find an ethereum exchange, open an account, and do the purchase. All this compared to to just running a program on your computer for free ether.   You're forgetting the PoW part where you have to own/buy a desktop PC with gfx hardware, install drivers, ensure proper power and cooling, etc.   With PoS, you can use a decentralized exchange to get Ether. So it's go on coinbase.com, buy BTC, send to exchange address, get ether, click Stake button in Mist. I presume major exchanges will offer fiat to ether conversion directly eventually.  The fact is, the number of people currently with computers/laptops that can run a PoS node is far larger than the number of people with computers capable of doing PoW. Also, since PoS doesn't require any minimum investment, the financial barrier is lower.    PoS is only good for scalability when we need it.   Being more scalable will lower the cost of computation/gas, which will allow bigger apps to run. You still didn't address the concern that an Ethereum fork that goes PoS first gains more momentum because it is cheaper/more scalable."
ethereum,3dvfgz,etherminer24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"It will be over 2GB about 1.25 years after the fronteir launch   Which is all that's needed for bootstrapping new users.   You're forgetting the PoW part where you have to own/buy a desktop PC with gfx hardware, install drivers, ensure proper power and cooling, etc.   People already have computers with GPUs.  In fact, to buy Ether with PoS, you need a computer.  This argument is invalid.   With PoS, you can use a decentralized exchange to get Ether.   Mist/decentralized exchanges won't be ready for many months.   Also, since PoS doesn't require any minimum investment, the financial barrier is lower.   Not only is this wrong, but you're missing the point.  No minimum investment is required for the millions people who already have a computer with a GPU in it.   It's already a sunk cost.  That's like saying you need to make a minimum investment with PoS by buying a computer or iPhone to use the coinbase app.  It's irrelevant.  The point you're missing is that PoW has less barriers to entry for new users and better for bootstrapping the network in early stage.  PoS only makes sense to switch to after 1-2 years, which is not only what the plan already IS, but is also what most of the devs agree with."
ethereum,3dvfgz,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:09 2015 UTC,"Which is all that's needed for bootstrapping new users.   Okay...1 year of PoW is already planned, but you stated earlier we should do PoW for 2-3 years, which is what I'm arguing against.   People already have computers with GPUs.   Would you agree there are far more computers/laptops without GPU's with 2+GB of VRAM than those with? For those without the proper GPU already, they have to buy and install one, which is pretty technical for most people, assuming their PC can even handle it. Also all laptops without the proper GPU can't be upgraded, they they would just need to get new ones.   Mist/decentralized exchanges won't be ready for many months.   Until Mist is ready, Ethereum isn't ready for mass adoption anyway. Most people aren't going to learn a console. But even without a dec exchange, it's just a few more mouse clicks to use a centralized one, which there will be multiple ready on launch.   No minimum investment is required for the millions people who already have a computer with a GPU in it.   No you're missing the point. There are hundreds of millions more people with computers than CANT do PoW, but CAN do PoS. There are also hundreds of millions more people who don't understand computer hardware, but do understand using exchanges.   PoW has less barriers to entry for new users   If you already own a 2GB+ GPU, yes. If not, no."

Frontier gives 10x the reward Olympic does and the miner will likely be at least a little easier to set up. If Ether does gain some real value on the exchanges, tons of GPU hash power will come over from other coins. You will be earning dust per day, at best. Your argument is that with PoS you have to buy coins. You have to buy coins with PoW too (cost of the rig because God knows your little gaming PC is going to mine dust, electricity, etc.). You're paying either way. I don't know what it is with your PoW worshippers, but you're badly deluded.  Please stop being stupid on this subreddit."

ethereum,3dtjq8,ramvi,2,Mon Jul 20 10:37:01 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't be the best to answer that. I haven't mined anything in Olympic. Just read a lot! Maybe post something in forum.ethereum.org, someone might have tried. 290s seem to be more widely used."
ethereum,3dtjq8,ramvi,2,Mon Jul 20 12:12:55 2015 UTC,"I believe there's no reason to crossfire them for mining purposes. It only brings a performance penalty. You only need to run this command, increasing the number for every GPU you have available:  ethminer -G --opencl-device 0 ethminer -G --opencl-device 1 etc."
ethereum,3dtjq8,ramvi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:10 2015 UTC,Ah.. do you mind explaining why there is a performance penalty?
ethereum,3dtjq8,FaultyMelon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:35 2015 UTC,"There is some kind of penalty in making the OS believe there is only one GPU and then having the operations work in parallell on the two GPUs. You get about 1.75x performance instead of 2x.  Furthermore, do you need enough VRAM to mine, but more than enough doesn't make it go faster, meaning two GPUs with 2GB will allow you to start two miners instead of one miner on your 4GB crossfire card."
ethereum,3dtjq8,ramvi,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"Least Authority have audited Ethereum and found this about mining:   the most cost-effective hardware configuration would use the GDDR5 ram found in readily available graphics cards today.   And:   Essentially, the most popular graphics cards (with 2GB of memory) will be rendered suddenly unusable for mining at a time about 16 months after launch.       This means that the cheapest 2GB DDR5 graphics card you can find is the most cost-effective way to mine the first 16 months. There's a plan for a full PoW overhaul 9 months after release and a move to Proof-of-Stake when ready, meaning buying expensive GPUs to continue mining after the 16 months is a high risk.  The algorithm is optimized for the Radeon HD 7850 so that is probably the best card to get."

You can implement damn near any social system you like on a blockchain: it's not clear to me, at this point, that blockchains have any pervasive bias other than the normal push that lower transaction costs and decentralization provide - small actors comparatively do better as they adopt these technologies, and middle men get disintermediated.  But that only applies to a pure digital environment. Add a scarce physical resource like electricity or water, and now you've got things like dynamic auction pricing of access to the stuff you need to stay alive. Cryptocurrencies are clearly able to go both ways on these things, either better or worse outcomes can come depending on a whole bunch of factors outside the technology.  A role to play? Sure.  Which role - that's for us to fight for."

So the basic concept of easy to verify and hard to brute force goes out of the window as both can take the same time to carry out. There is no easy solution to this which is understandable, but on the other hand quite disappointing to see the devs avoiding to address the shortcomings of their platform (even if its just the spam). The only way to verify the blockchain in decent amount of time is to get a quad-core CPU with an ssd at least (read somewhere someone with an octa-core server did a full sync in 6 hours), the other option is to download the verified blockchain from someone else, which defeats the whole purpose of the project.

ethereum,3dnw36,mwilcox,3,Sat Jul 18 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"IMO, since Bitcoin's BTC is mainly a token that serves as a hyper-efficient store of value with high network effects in it's ecosystem, it is useful for defensive investing (Grexit), long term investing, or short term speculation.  Ethereum's Ether is more like an energy commodity that will be useful as a ""fuel"" to power dapps. As the Ethereum ecosystem expands and contracts so will supply and demand for Ether. Ether seems more tied to the economic use, like crude oil prices are tied to it's economic use for transport.  If I am correct, both token's values will not be correlated and will respond to different needs so both will have great utility for different purposes and different times (which makes them even more valuable - think MPT).  One example, although not perfect, is Litecoin, why does it still exist and trade with reasonable volume? I think the answer is that it responds to different use cases and thus its market dynamics are useful for different players depending on the circumstances."

ethereum,3dnw36,ponziunit,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:24 2015 UTC,"Risk/security profiles Fee tolerance Complexity profiles Monetary policy Tribal affiliation  Network effects Functionality evaluations    There are lots of ways in which people have fundamentally different values even the same person might look at the future and see themselves as having radically different needs in different scenarios within this uncertain world.   The biggest divide I see between bitcoiners and etherists in the long run is in monetary policy. Bitcoins will simply not change. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins produced and the ones that are available will always be going down due to lost wallets. This is something that Ethereum cannot have in its fuel tokens as it is undesirable to have fuel that is always increasing in value (even if you divide the tokens up it creates a divide in wealth between new users and early adopters that will eventually lead to a new community developing around a fork simply to be the early adopters of the new currency: a new tribe) and if Ethereum is to be proof of stake then there needs to be some way to incentivize that. The same problem applies to peercoin: in order to function it needs to have inflation that never ends but because of that some people will never adopt it even if they think it can be just as secure and more efficient as the monetary policy is simply unacceptable (to them).   You could of course create a meta currency on top of ethereum with bitcoins inflation model but that does not replicate its network effect / tribal affiliation or its simplicity.   Those subjective attributes of money may not seem very important compared to functional considerations but really they are what is important for money: credit/value are subjective, capturing them and locking them down in a digital token when the functionality of a digital token can be endlessly replicated by forks can only be done by appealing to those subjective factors in one way or another in my opinion."
ethereum,3dnw36,JonnyLatte,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:57:57 2015 UTC,There's no reason the fuel token can't increase in value. Just lower the gas price. That has to happen anyway as Moore's Law makes the operations cheaper.
ethereum,3dnw36,ItsAConspiracy,3,Sat Jul 18 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Its not a matter of it being technically possible. Some people just dont like it. If they dont like it there is a possibility that they will form a community around a different economic policy or just the same policy with a different group. Hell, its the reason people are here developing ethereum as a separate community rather than as a side chain of bitcoin that imputes all the value of the economic activity into bitcoin. We want to profit from our own economic activity more directly than the diffuse returns that an increase in the bitcoin price would generate from the development of a side chain.  Having a strict deflationary currency in my opinion accelerates this process of communities budding off as differences in the distribution of funds becomes more apparent when there are strong incentives to save in it rather than individuals just having what they need to perform other economic activities. There is a limit of course since too high inflation makes a currency unusable but where those lines are drawn is different to different people and is why you still see people accepting different monetary policy.   Ethereum has huge advantages over bitcoin in my opinion as it will be able to bring into existence derivatives that might act to capture these communities but if the class of fuel token holders is being continuously enriched off of the activity of others then there is always a chance that some people will want their own network secured by and benefiting their own economy."
ethereum,3dnw36,JonnyLatte,4,Sat Jul 18 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"""Bitcoin is digital gold"" makes as much sense as ""Litecoin is silver"" and ""Dogecoin is bronze"".  The original consensus ledger is what bitcoin has going for it.  The value came from being able to do digital transactions outside of fiat restrictions.  That's it.    Combine the centralization of mining, the lack of political consensus to make even the simplest change of a larger blocksize - scaling is completely out of the question for bitcoin.  People talk about Greece - bitcoin can't begin to handle it.  People would be limited to like one transaction a week if it was ONLY Greeks using bitcoin.  Why in the world would people grow into something that isn't scalable into the future AT ALL.  It isn't scalable due to the technology and the politics.    I know it isn't politically correct to say but if bitcoin doesn't scale (which it isn't going to) it dies.  If something doesn't take bitcoin's place that can scale - crypto dies.  Forced massive wealth accumulation for early adopters is terrible for long term adoption - I don't like it.  But it's kinda the way it is."

Adding in a reputation system based on some sort of quality-of-completion metric, or even using reputation systems from other DApps would increase the quality of the survey results making them far more valuable to any potential customers.

With this one in particular it's more (in my opinion) a design flaw of having so much processing going on, so it's not like the reaction is going to be a quick fix before launch.   It would be possible to be more discriminatory with transactions if I knew more golang, though really I don't have the hashrate or the bandwidth to waste my luck on any transactions at all. The client seems to get very slow when you actually mine a block (you can fall behind the network sometimes), so it's in my best interests just to ignore them completely so the block has as little disruption as possible. There's probably something being locked in the client while transmitting a block which prevents you also downloading new ones, but I don't have much familiarity with this code at all to know where it is."

By exploiting the slow processing behavior in the Ethereum clients we can gain far higher relative hashrates to other people by forcing them to fall behind processing the chain and subsequently mining stale blocks. At an extreme we could use a very small hashrate to lead the network while the miners with real hashrates are being denial of service attacked by the sheer volume of transactions in blocks."

You're appealing to people's kindness, the type of people who take their time on a weekend to answer questions on forums - freaking losers right? Let's make their life miserable!   Step 3) Wait for an audience and developers to arrive on the scene. The more the better! After all, the goal is to waste their time and spread FUD here.   Step 4) When you see a developer, post a very technical comment in reply to him that raise even more concern, maybe something along the lines of you found an attack, but explain it in as vague terms as possible. After all, you didn't really find an attack. It doesn't matter what the dev posted. Ignore it.   Step 5) The dev will probably get irritated. Victory!!!! You'll reply within minutes, because you've been waiting for hours in front of your computer refreshing the page over and over to survey the damage done. Insure you are as offended as possible by their reply. They clearly aren't taking your very valid technical concern seriously!   Step 6) Make sure you tell everyone about this on the thread. Start posting everywhere. Post a link to the developer's post titled 'developers don't care' or something like that. Send PMs to his coworkers to try to create internal strife. Make sure you take screenshots all the time, as if you were uncovering a big conspiracy.  Step 6) If you did your job well, well-meaning users will take you seriously and ask for a patch. You're the hero! But ... what a shame... the dog ate your SSD... or maybe the devs were so rude to you, you now have no time to produce the patch. That will teach them!  The best part is that you don't have to prove anything as there's nothing to prove!   Oh, and if you or your sockpuppets get banned, scream about fascism and something vaguely related to freedom of speech.   Rinse, wash, repeat.   The life of a 'concern troll' is a good one indeed."

ethereum,3djtnu,Ursium,2,Fri Jul 17 10:56:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I think there are a few different understandings of how DAG mining works. I am FAR from an expert, but I know a very little bit. One of those bits is that the miner has to build a complex look-up table (the DAG) and store it in memory for fast reference. When you mine with a GPU, the DAG is stored in the ultra fast GDDR (Graphical memory) located on the GPU. This DAG cannot interact directly (swap) with disk memory or system memory (Motherboard RAM).  So, you could probably use swap mining on a CPU mining rig, it would likely be even slower than regular CPU mining and certainly not worthwhile."
ethereum,3djtnu,aedigix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:14:47 2015 UTC,"This is correct, I was referring to GPU mining, CPU mining with swapping is probably possible but likely pointless.."
ethereum,3djtnu,Lorix_In_Oz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I was talking about CPU mining but GPU mining with less than 1gb is more of an implementation issue rather than a technical limitation.   With a specialized video card driver, some BIOS settings, and a custom OpenCL implementation to use that specialized DAG storage to use CPU RAM as a DAG ""swap space"" but it will be around 1/5th the memory bandwidth capacity of direct GDDR.  If you are savvy enough you can even implement GDDR -> CPU RAM swap prefetching mechanism in your custom driver/OpenCL implementation.  So technically it's not impossible but it's a lot of work just to be able to mine."

However, if Peronet Despeignes thinks a million people are going to pitch in, the Augur team needs to reach those users where they are, or where they are going to be. For example, hundreds of millions of viewers who collectively contribute millions of comments on ""News"" websites already (i.e. Bloomberg, Reuters, &tc.).... could be using Augur there. These sites then should be convinced to implement an Augur voting plug-in platform - that is essentially an Augur wallet with market creation ability. Such a plug-in would sit below an article, read the content with AI to match for other existing markets then post them for readers to bet on.  Such an aggregator of topics with full UI and voting capability where the users attention is already focused is what Augur will need for mass (million+) user adoption."
ethereum,3dgnv7,PseudonymousChomsky,5,Thu Jul 16 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"Has anyone done any intelligent research to price out what Augur REP tokens might be worth? I would imagine purchasers would like to know before purchasing REP. In one sense, the crowd sale itself is a decentralized prediction on what the venture is worth.  Assuming fees settle down to 2% and Augur achieves the same volume of Intrade at its height ($20 million dollars per year), then my best wild guess is anywhere between 0.5 - 3 million US dollars.  I'd like to see some data that would give a more precise estimate."
ethereum,3dgnv7,paulpaschos,5,Thu Jul 16 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"Intrade at its height was 20M shares traded, which is ~$100M, and over 90% of that was election markets.  Betfair has ~$1B a year last I checked.  Then there's the black swan factor of the Chinese markets (~$1T on soccer, cricket, tennis) who pay huge fees to the Chinese gov't online currently.  Add in the fact that it's a truly global market, anyone can make markets on Augur, so it essentially allows for Arrow-Debreu ""complete markets"" on anything, you get something that's almost impossible to estimate.    Perhaps the easiest way is to just make a market that says ""How much volume will Augur have per year 3 years from now?  5 years from now?  10 years from now?""  Yeah in theory the crowdsale should be a prediction of what the future revenue stream of rep is worth, discounted heavily due to the moonshot nature of all this."

ethereum,3dgnv7,nmonmo,3,Thu Jul 16 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, they'll be attached to your ethereum address. No sidechains, no fixed rates. They'll have a free market value which will be determined by the end of the token sale. Obviously, once the full software launches, the value of those tokens could fluctuate on the market (though, likely only to go up, as they'll be fully distributed, unless several large holders attempt to dump.)"
ethereum,3dgnv7,nmonmo,3,Thu Jul 16 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, so to be clear, the value of the Augur tokens will fluctuate independently from Ether value and in that sense will be based on the demand to utilize the Augur platform which needs the Augur tokens to participate.  Is that correct?"

ethereum,3dgnv7,PettyHoe,2,Fri Jul 17 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"There's a way to initialize them to be that way.  So to create a combinatorial market you create each of the events you want to combine (presumably you'd select them in the UI from preexisting events or just make your own).  Then the order of the events determines how the combinatorial market is setup.  So the first event (using binary events here to keep things simple), let's say ""Hillary Clinton will win the 2016 US Presidential election"" would be your x axis.  The second event, say ""US GDP will be above 2.5% in 2017"" would be your y axis.  Where they intersect are the different combinations of events  Now what you end up with is something like this https://imgur.com/xbTULK4  As for making this easy for users to use these markets, it'll be a UI/UX challenge, I think Scott will be able to pull it off though!"

ethereum,3dgnv7,PettyHoe,4,Thu Jul 16 06:33:39 2015 UTC,Do you have reasons why you believe that?  A blanket statement like that will not suffice if you wish to sway other's opinions.
ethereum,3dgnv7,Taek42,4,Thu Jul 16 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"I've actually had conversations with them, both in person and through email chains. It'd be a lot to go through the specifics, but in general they had a blatent disregard for some very serious security problems, and clear misunderstandings of certain properties of decentralized systems.  One of the most fundamental things that they didn't seem to grasp was that other nodes can run code that you didn't write. They built a system that works fine if everyone is following the rules, but it's easy enough for me to fork the code and modify it to run a malicious node. There were some problems there and they seemed to disbelieve that anyone would be capable of making malicious nodes to exploit the problems.  That was around 8 months ago, I don't know where they are today. But so far I haven't seen very much that would get me to change my mind. Augur is much better at marketing than they are at building a decentralized product.  I only say this because Augur is a cryptosystem. Cryptosystems are difficult to build at all, and monumentally difficult to build securely. Augur is new and fancy, which to cryptographers is very scary. Many cryptographers still don't trust SHA3 simply because it hasn't been battle hardened. Augur does a lot more than just a Blockchain, they introduce an entire decentralized reputation system - something that doesn't currently exist in a secure way.  That should throw up extraordinary red flags. Decentralized reputation systems don't exist yet because they are very difficult to do. A team of college undergrads claiming they've solved all of the problems should put you on edge, especially when it's very difficult to have a conversation with them about the technical details."
ethereum,3dgnv7,joeykrug,6,Thu Jul 16 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"but it's easy enough for me to fork the code and modify it to run a malicious node.   Gonna be blunt here.  I don't think you understand how ethereum or contract whitelisting works.  Only Augur contracts will be able to call any mission critical code of other augur contracts.  You can fork the code and run a malicious node if you want, but it'll be in an alternate universe where it can't communicate with our nodes.  I don't disbelieve you, I know this is wrong.     Augur does a lot more than just a Blockchain, they introduce an entire decentralized reputation system - something that doesn't currently exist in a secure way.   We're not really a decentralized reputation system.  Our system has reputation in it, but it's not traditional reputation, nor is it useful for any other application.  You've confused our reputation system with that of a traditional reputation system (which other people are working on that problem).  We have a reputation system similar to schellingcoin in that it rewards going with the consensus on event outcomes and punishes going against it, that's it.  The algorithm we use (clustering) requires an understanding of middle school math; it's quite simple.  From reading this, I think you're one of the people who emailed me after Dan Elitzer introduced me to some MIT mailing list (but if i remember correctly, you didn't actually go to MIT).  I quit responding because you refused to show any initiative in actually reading any of the sources I linked you to, and completely didn't understand at all how ethereum worked.  It's not difficult to have a conversation with us at all, provided you don't come in with a whole host of assumptions and a sheet of ignorance.  Jack with a PhD in Biophysics from UCSF (involves a lot of statistical modelling, which is key when testing our consensus) and Perry with a degree in Econ from Harvard might beg to differ on us all being college undergrads.  But you know what?  You don't have to trust us.  I wouldn't.  You know what I'd do?  I'd read our documents, look at how we've tested our consensus system, and see if there's a way to make improvements on it.  And read our code!  That's the great part of open source, you don't have to trust us!  Now, if you have any valid security issues to bring up, i.e. ones that are actually possible I'd love to discuss them.  But I'm not going to waste my time discussing attacks that are literally impossible due to the nature of how ethereum works.   They built a system that works fine if everyone is following the rules   That's quite a large endorsement!  I wouldn't even make that without doing further testing :)   but it's easy enough for me to fork the code and modify it to run a malicious node.   This, however, due to the way ethereum contracts are run, is not possible.  You can fork the code, but you'll be in an independent universe all on your own if you don't do function calls specifically from the augur codebase/contracts.  The ""rules"" are cryptographically enforced.  If you call from a non augur contract fork it's akin to modifying bitcoin to give yourself a coinbase tx with 1M bitcoin, then connecting to the network.  The other nodes will (anthropomorphizing here a bit ;)) laugh at your node.    I'll bet you 10 Bitcoin that after our beta you can't make a contract that will communicate maliciously with our contracts.  Wanna bet?  Edit: this is a good discussion of traditional reputation systems: http://szabo.best.vwh.net/negative_rep.html but that's not the problem we're solving (or even trying to solve)."

If you want my approval, it would really help to link me to posts/talks/reviews by people with recognizable names who are saying ""I've reviewed the whitepaper, I've looked at the code, and it all looks good to me"".  What I've read on my own has told me that it's not worth reading more. The only way that I'm going to be convinced otherwise at this point is if other people I recognize as knowledgeable are saying things that go against my own impressions of the system.   Gonna be blunt here. I don't think you understand how ethereum or contract whitelisting works.   We had that discussion before you had decided to use ethereum. I'm merely explaining why I don't think that the Augur team is up to the task. All of my impressions are months old, but strong enough for me to believe that it's not really worth renewing them. The clear tension between us is even more reason not to bother - even if I did find a real security vulnerability that's relevent to your current setup, I doubt you'd accept it without hours and hours of discussion on my part.   But you know what? You don't have to trust us. I wouldn't. You know what I'd do? I'd read our documents, look at how we've tested our consensus system, and see if there's a way to make improvements on it. And read our code! That's the great part of open source, you don't have to trust us!   This is a fallacy. It's not enough for me to read your documents, because I'm not an expert on decentralized prediction markets. Even if I don't know how to break your system, that says nothing about more qualified people like Greg Maxwell or Paul Sztorc.  I haven't looked at your docs or code in about 8 months, but initially I spent probably 10+ hours looking over everything that Augur and Truthcoin had. I determined that Augur lacked competence, and that it wasn't worth my time to continue reading. The things you have said today haven't convinced me otherwise, and really the only thing that's going to make me change my mind about whether it's worth spending time figuring out whether or not you guys are legit is if other, trusted names start saying ""hey, these guys are worth checking out"".  If you want help on that one, Peter Todd will do contracting work for you. I believe his rate is $250/hr. Knowing him, he'd probably want 100+ hours before giving you a stamp of approval. So it'd be a very expensive stamp of approval. But that alone would be sufficient for me. I'm sure that's not your only option, there are probably ways to get approval from trusted names that won't cost tens of thousands of dollars.   Jack with a PhD in Biophysics from UCSF (involves a lot of statistical modelling, which is key when testing our consensus) and Perry with a degree in Econ from Harvard might beg to differ on us all being college undergrads.   I do apologize for that comment. I had incorrectly assumed you were all undergrads. I will highlight that their majors are not exactly relevant to cryptosystems, but many brilliant people have degrees in fields other than where they did their most impressive work."
ethereum,3dgnv7,sedmonster,3,Thu Jul 16 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"We were using Eth at that point btw, we switched in November.  We'll have all our code security audited, all the math checked, and everything tested thousands of times over before we'd even consider launching with live money.  I'd like to run some bug bounties as well, although I'm not convinced they're as effective as security audits from experts.  We plan to hire the folks who did the first formal security analysis on bitcoin to do our first audit (they have PhDs in Cryptography, which is fairly relevant :)).    We haven't started doing audits yet because our codebase is going to go through a lot of flux with new features and modifications over the next two months that will drastically change the security model.  Auditing now would be a waste of money, and I want to wait until we have a relatively final version (and I want to fix the bugs I know exist first).    As for some cool approval, checkout what https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/07/15/bitcoin-trends-in-1h-2015/, vbuterin, abe othman, david rothschild (we'll be on predictwise once we launch with live money), garzik, ron bernstein have all said about augur.    We're designing a cryptoeconomic system more than a cryptosystem.  By this I mean the cryptography we're using is quite rock solid (and we haven't invented any new cryptography here); the weaknesses lie in the game theory and economics of it.  After doing security reviews, a review of the economics and incentives behind it would be quite useful as well.     if I did find a real security vulnerability that's relevent to your current setup, I doubt you'd accept it without hours and hours of discussion   If you found a serious bug at this stage  1) I would take it seriously 2) I wouldn't be that surprised.    I nor anyone else claim we have a secure system now.  We're in alpha phase rapidly iterating on features, and will have security reviews and in depth analyses done after that's over as well as loads and loads of testing.    My point is that your huge ""you guys don't understand anything, this will fail due to me being able to make contract forks"" argument is incorrect.  People argue that bitcoin isn't secure because it uses an unproven curve.  Heck, it doesn't even solve the byzantine general's problem (it gives an economic solution to it).  I care about rapidly iterating on our platform and building it now, once it's nearly complete practically all my focus will shift over to having people review its security, help find bugs and flaws in it, etc.  I'd love to have anyone who wants to help review the security, including yourself, what I don't want is blanket statements like ""it'll fail because of x"" when x isn't something that's actually doable on ethereum.  Do you have a PhD in CS?  Would be nice to pay an ardent critic to review our system :)  P.S. might enjoy this: http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04089, we're not strangers to finding vulns in systems ;)  We have started some preliminary security reviews, like review of our clustering algorithm implementation by a data scientist, but are holding off to spend lots of money on it until our codebase is more stable."
ethereum,3dgnv7,Taek42,2,Thu Jul 16 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"We're designing a cryptoeconomic system more than a cryptosystem. By this I mean the cryptography we're using is quite rock solid (and we haven't invented any new cryptography here); the weaknesses lie in the game theory and economics of it. After doing security reviews, a review of the economics and incentives behind it would be quite useful as well.    This is exactly the type of statement that worries me. You are designing a cryptosystem. (an economic system as well, but absolutely a cryptosystem). You apply cutting edge cryptography in new ways.   We'll have all our code security audited, all the math checked, and everything tested thousands of times over before we'd even consider launching with live money.   Let me know when that has happened. It is reassuring that you are planning to do it.   As for some cool approval, checkout what https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/07/15/bitcoin-trends-in-1h-2015/, vbuterin, abe othman, david rothschild (we'll be on predictwise once we launch with live money), garzik, ron bernstein have all said about augur.    A namedrop from Coinbase doesn't mean a whole lot to me. I tried looking for Jeff Garzik's comments about Augur, but I couldn't find anything more than a name drop. Specifically, I'm looking for a ""I've reviewed it, it's well thought out"" type of comment.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much from your current phase. It certainly doesn't make sense to pay for an audit when there are still problems that you personally are aware of and know how to fix.   My point is that your huge ""you guys don't understand anything, this will fail due to me being able to make contract forks"" is incorrect.   I really want to see decentralized prediction markets happen in the next decade. I would be really happy to be wrong on this one. I hope that Augur is competent and up to the task and I hope you guys succeed. But I personally would not invest in you, and I would not advise any of my friends to invest in you. Other people are free to draw their own conclusions.  If only we had a prediction market that we could use to put our money where our mouth is. I could buy 'Augur will fail' shares, and you could buy 'Augur will not fail' shares, and the winner would make a profit at the loser's expense."

PoS has drawbacks in that its harder for people to obtain ether -- they have to buy on an exchange.

As for shapeshift, you could use it to buy in with small amounts of altcoins as a convenience thing but the sale itself isn't really administered through it. The way it's done now is each user has a unique Bitcoin address they send funds to (so you could use shapeshift to send whatever to end up sending us Bitcoin) and then the unique address forwards to our multisig. Then a page loads where you can input your ethereum address either then or at any point before Augur launches with live money.

You might want to take a look at some of the issues LaZooz recently experienced during their crowdfunding requiring a native BTC wallet to send their coins.

They ended up allowing folks to create an Omniwallet and update their public address via e-mail."
ethereum,3dd3o4,joeykrug,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"We don't require a native BTC wallet to send coins, you can send your bitcoin from anywhere, same for ether.    What we require is a real ether wallet for people to use to report with, which means at some point before our live launch you'll need to download geth and type geth account new and save that address and input it into our system or maybe even mist will be out by then.    This is something that, provided you're not so hardcore you use our sale without an email, we can bug you about before launch, and provide a step by step guide on how to generate an ethereum address and save / secure the keys (which is what you'd end up using for reporting).  There'll probably be an ethereum guide for this once frontier launches and we can link to it directly from our sale app, if not I'll write one.  I also plan to make a screencap video process of all of this which we'll link to as well."

Banks and exchanges take time to clear fiat, so knowing well enough in advance of launch would allow many people here to get ready.  Perhaps you can ask those exchanges going live for ether trading at launch, who you want to confirm for themselves..... to drop in here at r/ethereum well in advance of launch to let us know?"
ethereum,3dcgqr,PseudonymousChomsky,4,Wed Jul 15 12:06:34 2015 UTC,Absolutely.   So just to be 100% super clear - there is no such thing as a live exchange at launch because of the aforementioned low starting gas limit. Exchanges will be able to list Ether as soon as the gas limit reaches the transaction threshold and the network has a healthy hashrate.  I think getting the exchanges to announce their intention to list Ether on the Reddit is an excellent idea and I'll recommend that they do so :)

They artificially set the price of Ethercoin at $1, so that if the price of Ether is actually lower, the Ethercoin market cannot economically reflect this.  Approaching from another angle: no rational person will take the Ethercoin proposition because it is not game-theoretically in their favor, even if Ethercoin and their mystery backer are completely legit. Period. From this we can conclude that irrational people are buying Ethercoin, and the price is $1 + exuberance.

If you engage in strategy (1), your expected value per second is:   Probability X/D * T_N / T_B: another block on top of the head is already in transit, so your block becomes an uncle. You get 4.375 ETH. Probability X/D * 1 - T_N / T_B: you mine a block on the head, you get 5 + F ETH.   If you engage in strategy (2), your expected value per second is:   Probability X/D * T_N / T_B: another block on top of the head is already in transit, so your block becomes an uncle two levels below the top (ie. a great-uncle). You get 3.75 ETH. Probability X/D * 1 - T_N / T_B: you mine a block on the head, you get 4.375 ETH.   Hence, strategy (1) gives you expected reward of X/D * (4.375 + (0.625 + F) * (1 - T_N / T_B)), and strategy (2) gives you expected reward of X/D * (3.75 + 0.625 * (1 - T_N / T_B)). The difference between those two is X/D * (0.625 + F * (1 - T_N / T_B)) in favor of (1), so (1) is always the better strategy.

ethereum,3d8ayl,vbuterin,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:32 2015 UTC,If there is currently only one head it seems always be best to mine one the head. But if there are currently 2 heads it might have a higher EV to mine an uncle instead of deciding for one head.

ethereum,3d8ayl,joshuad31,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:45 2015 UTC,Intuitively this seems to make sense but you have to think more about it.  I believe that you can actually mine an uncle 6 blocks back too but again imagine you did that you would still need to propagate your block and have a miner include it in the main chain before it becomes an uncle 7 blocks back.  I don't believe you can mine on an uncle however to produce a child that does not have a parent which exists on the main chain.  I really hope someone can clarify if this is true.  My intuitive way of thinking about the problem is to say:   There is a new lottery every 12 seconds. You have 100 dollars you can spend a minute on lottery tickets. Your odds are 1 in 100000 to win the lottery for every lottery ticket you have.   do you take 40 or 60 or 80 dollars and play to win a lottery with a payout of 1000 dollars or do take 20 dollars and play to win a lottery of potentially 1150 dollars (1000 + fees / uncle rewards).  In one option your odds are 80 in 100000 for $1000  In another option your odds are:  20 in 100000 + 20 in 100000 + 20 in 100000 + 20 in 100000   But your potential payout is $1150 each time.  So in that case why would you mine on a parent a grandparent or great grand parent rather than on a child?
ethereum,3d8ayl,Ursium,5,Tue Jul 14 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"The static block reward is 5 Ether. The 0.3125 would come from including two uncles as part of a block. The uncles would receive  4.375 each.  To answer your question, the miner of the block gets the static block reward + all gas mined in the block + a reward for including uncles. For this reason it's always preferable of course to mine a block rather than an uncle.   See: https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/comment/9933/#Comment_9933 for a description of rewards.

ethereum,3d8ayl,koeppelmann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"It has for sure been a problem. Lets say we have block A, B, and C and B and C are children of A. Now you could main a regular block on the longest chain (so a block behind B or C) The ev of this block would be smaller than creating a uncle to A because a uncle to A would make it always in the chain while a block behind B or C would only make it into the chain if your fork wins. However, this has changed with the limitations of 2 uncles per block. So there will be competition for uncles as well.

So this means that ownership of wealth previously depended on a strong state that executed laws reliably.  Now ownership of digital assets doesn't rely on any sort of government.  But this doesn't mean that things change for ownership of physical assets but some physical assets (smart property) can be secured by the blockchain.  https://youtu.be/yQvhEUuwJCk?t=27  Although most people disagree with me I think that this technology is likely to improve the quality of life for those living below 10 dollars a day but above 3 dollars a day (30-40% approx of the worlds population) while also distributing wealth to those whose income is above 250,000 a year.  Those whose earnings are 20,000 to 70,000 USD per year are likely to be hit the hardest because blockchain automates many white collar professional jobs out of existence.  Any job that existed due to payment friction is gone, any job that doesn't involve creativity or creative problem solving is gone.  Its a minimum of 20% of the white collar professionals by 2020.

ethereum,3d5w77,DonaldMcIntyre,3,Tue Jul 14 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"IMO the concept of ""corporation"", like when they started as chartered companies 500 years ago, is still useful.  In its generic form: a group of people that unite to pitch in resources, with limited liability to what they pitch in, that work together, and can hire or be hired, all to work for a unified goal, is very valid.  I think Ethereum provides a platform to:   Create and register these corporations as DAOs on the blockchain in seconds. Bypass bureaucratic centralized registry systems. Use the accounting and monetary system of the blockchain. Establish the activities, functions as software programs on the blockchain. Establish the rules and strategies of the DAOs as smart contracts. Count and distribute earnings (or losses) automatically, transparent, self audited, and with no flaws.   But I think the base increasing returns problems in the economy will not be solved. Wealth might be better distributed, but the ""gravitational"" effect of wealth and it's centralization tendency will still be suffered under Ethereum.  The good thing is that Ethereum will provide an unprecedented competitive space with much more opportunity for disruption by the small guys. This is to say, that big wealthy DAOs will have to be very innovative and fast to keep up with smaller disruptors."

I can see Ethereum opening up the opportunity for the return of trade guilds where you have various professions becoming detached from corporations just like how etsy enabled the stay at home mom to sell her craft or Uber allowing people to become taxi drivers without having to get a loan from the Yellow Cab."

I know nothing about coding; I'm assuming the devs are doing magnificent work from what I'm reading here. I do know a thing or two about communications, however, and what we have is appalling.   Originally we had /u/Ursium as the community manager and then he got promoted and now we have a /u/hexayurt. From his posts, it's apparent that there is no communication or consensus at the highest levels of this project, which is why information is so slow to come out.  It's absurd that people should still be pointing to old information. There should be one single page, updated biweekly, with all the current information (i.e. ""two week warning given...final warning will be given 48 hours prior to launch""). It's ridiculous to make people follow the reddit, the forums, and the blog in order to keep up with what's going on around here. If I didn't have an hour or two a day, I'd be completely lost.  tl;dr, EthDev, the Foundation, or whoever the hell is in charge of Ethereum has really, truly, shitty communication. After /u/hexayurt's post of the other day, I'm beginning to think that it's not poor community management like I initially though (sorry Vinay) but that it's a systemic lack of decision-making. Vinay can't report what hasn't been decided or communicated to him!!"

It seems like they leave Vinay out on limbs a lot. Probably more than anything this is just indicative of the esteem in which computer scientists hold the profession of public relations ;). But clearly he has written some blog posts that he thought were relevant but never got cleared or events on the ground changed in such a way as to make the posts irrelevant.   My gut is that after being surprised by an initial glut of bugs in Olympic, and Vinay preparing some ""bad news"" posts, they've now been surprised that the bugs cleared and its running smoothly for a the last week or two. So they're holding off on the bad news posts in hopes they won't be necessary and launch is genuinely imminent. If it is, I'd expect Vinay to step to the forefront again. I think this is what they mean when they say the launch is being driven by the programming, not the PR."

If you have an idea stronger than that, I will happily talk with you about it in private.  EDIT: Oh, three big issues:   Location, time and both sides of matching are extremely de-anonymizing. If location, traits and desired traits are transferred P2P, how does one determine that the counter party isn't Sybil, even after seeing their traits? There would have to be a public trait like reputation... and if a service provider has that sorted out, dating is just a free service on top of that. Actually sharing these types of secrets is very difficult on Ethereum. Some theoretical thing like FHE or Oblivious transfer or some other exotic off-chain method would be required. Or you could just use reputation and trust.    Honestly, I think just using real identities and reputation is the way to go with dating.

ethereum,3cxhup,afdudley,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I think where Ethereum could be useful in Dating would be gamification and reputation systems.  OKCupid became successful not because it marketed itself as a dating site but because of the quizzes which encouraged users to participate.    A decentralized OKCupid platform would work somewhat similarly with various components:   Member profiles with built-in reputation/badge system. Quiz/testing framework/registry that other DApp developers can use and create their own quizzes/questions.  Users can pay some ether to the quizzes to take them and in return the quiz ÐApp rewards them a badge for taking the quiz. 3rd party matching oracles (MaaS - Matchmaking as a service)  then query the quiz registry and collect quiz results for things that are relevant to their respective matching algorithm and reputation requirements.  Users looking to find a match sends some ETH to the oracle and they get a list of matches.  Users can pick one or several oracles to get more accurate results.
ethereum,3cxhup,aedigix,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, afdudley. Ah, maybe 'trustless dating' is the wrong word, or our definitions are at a cross?

Indeed, a version of reputation is in the requirements. There is a game theory problem I'm trying to address: how do you provide insight into the true frame of your personality while not looking odd or extreme? Right now, a vast majority of dating profiles are 'safe and bland' because to maximize their opportunities very few people want to communicate their true passions, thus two high quality matches may pass like ships in the night.

The goal isn't pure Anonymity; but trust that the app will properly encrypt and store very sensitive data in a way that provides users enough trust to be themselves rather a bland lie.   Yes, this definition makes a lot more sense, thanks for clarifying. I think a well implemented wallet will provide this. I think it's definitely a feature worth looking into but I generally think that while Ethereum will be fundamentally decentralizing in terms of data ownership, it will be fundamentally centralizing in the sense that all of the interesting features must work through a wallet or other specialized app. I have a lot more to say about this, but I don't want to digress. :)      Indeed, a version of reputation is in the requirements. There is a game theory problem I'm trying to address: how do you provide insight into the true frame of your personality while not looking odd or extreme?   As a student of Psychology, I think this is more generally a problem with the failures of self-report. Additionally, my experience living in the US, and dating in NYC, leads me to believe that most Americans have very confused models of dating and courtship; which feed into the misleading self-reports. The guy who runs OkCupid and wrote a book about it has a lot of very interesting and demonstrably false ideas about dating based on his atheoretic/data-driven approach to the problem. I think a strong model and rigorous third party evaluation works better... I think a better service would be 'decentralized professional matchmaker' instead of 'decentralized tinder' I would be interested in hacking on either, but to be frank, I don't see a pot filled with money at the end of either rainbow :D      Right now, a vast majority of dating profiles are 'safe and bland' because to maximize their opportunities very few people want to communicate their true passions, thus two high quality matches may pass like ships in the night.

Indeed, picking the 'ideal traits' of a date is a crapshoot of success. Yet should there at least be a more elegant and less wasteful path to learn, experiment, change our minds, and grow? I think my design can facilitate that. OkCupid and Tinder are alright; but they fail at respecting basic practical relationship filters of phase and passion, and everyone wastes a lot of time slogging through it all.   Tinder could produce $75 million in revenue in 2015 with a valuation of $1.1 billion; the money is there. Tinder's product design is not where it ought to be...

Start with the problem.  Often startup founders are advised to fall in love with the problem not the technology.  So what is the problem you are seeking to solve? (And is technology and for that matter block chain technology a key enabler).  If you are purely a technologist (as many would be here) – pony up with someone who knows a domain space ..deeply, very deeply and spend lots and lots of time hanging around them.  One of the wisest things I have seen written about blockchain technologies so far is for them to work they will require the very best technologists as a necessity but this in of itself will be insufficient – blockchain technologies will reach critical mass when those technologists interact with those business types who are deeply thinking about the critical issues of their industry – both need each other.  RE a trustless dating site – or trustless dating – lol yep clearly you haven’t been divorced/wondered how to establish new relationships/friendships when old ones have died – trustless dating.  Yep that’s the standard vanilla market offering ;)  And it’s not about technology rather it is about relating and that’s about been human.  Best wishes philip.

The ethereum platform is a mechanism for providing consensus following the transition of one state to another, and, because the state transition is based on the output of executing a turing complete language, it's a platform which yields a platform.  A few things eth depends on:   Given a value x and function f, there is one value x' which is the output of f(x), and given x', one cannot determine f and x.  Bounded execution of turing-complete language code  Uniformly bribe workers (proof of work) into agreement  Indexed via cryptographic hashes  (different from CPU models)   Someone at one point said that ""bitcoin was created to employ the human population into building faster bitcoin miners"". If we were to assume that CPUs were created in order to employ humans into building faster CPUs, then indeed, the CPU model and Ethereum are much the same."

I am just some random dude on the internet, so take anything I say with a grain of salt, obviously :D     How is the Ethereum network holding up?   Testing is moving along at a reasonable pace.      I heard there is a testnet. What are the chances of critical vulnerabilities/attacks occurring?   Slim. Most attackers who are looking to profit will wait quite some time anyway.      Has this been a messy project or is there some structure?   LOL. All things considered I think it's actually going fairly well. It's an insanely risky project and I think that sort of project attracts a certain type of person.      Is the initial promise of a decentralized 'platform' for other apps still holding up?   Yes, but it takes some time for developers to wrap their heads around the restrictions. Personally, I think there are some slight feature set mismatches, but nothing to be too concerned about.      Also what about the distribution of Ether. If everyone holds their Ether like an investment instead of it being used, like bitcoin, are we screwed? I have no intent on actually using my Ether.   The plan is to switch from PoW to PoS. If issuance is done properly in that new system, it should be fine. Issuance in the current PoW system will work out fine if people hold as well.     I have stated in the past that I don't think it makes sense to let the price of Ether float, but then I realized that if the price floats every developer and charitable contributor (you aren't an investor) has the hope of experiencing their ideal liquidity event. There is no way to know now, but I suspect even with gas prices working as a buffer, dapp operators(sic) will experience failures due to price volatility; but I also acknowledge it's an extremely tricky problem and there are a number of engineering solutions available after the problem is seen in the wild. All that to say, I rather live in a world with minimal speculation, I think speculation will hurt Ethereum in much the same way it hurts any number of other things that exist in the world today."

As far as I know there aren't any explorers being written, nor officially supported by ETH/DEV and that is just fine. Our goal is to create a platform that fosters innovation, in a decentralized way. This entails leaving it up to healthy competition to take a bite out of the pie, and not trying to do everything ourselves in house :)  Of course, every developer of ETH/DEV is free to work on whatever technology and idea in their own free time, so if someone chooses to write a block explorer, then be it :)"

ethereum,3cjnmw,luffintlimme,5,Wed Jul 8 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"In my opinion (my wife is an eBay power seller) it will be like this.  The components on the traditional eBay are:   Seller Product App (web or mobile) eBay database for profiles, reputation, and product listing. Payments system (Paypal). Seller cash account. Delivery process (USPS, Fedex, etc.). Buyer money and cash account. Buyer.   The theoretical eBay dapp is:   Seller. Product. Dapp (Mist, web, or mobile). Ethereum (accounts, money, reputation, payment system, product listing -swarm-).  Delivery process (USPS, Fedex, etc.). Buyer.   I think the main eBay and Paypal functions will be decentralized in Ethereum."
ethereum,3cjnmw,DonaldMcIntyre,6,Wed Jul 8 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"eBay without any corporation or employees.  It would be a crowd-funded, and crowd-managed version of eBay...  fully transparent, much more efficient, next to no fees, and most importantly no connection whatsoever to Paypal!"

ethereum,3cjnmw,luffintlimme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but the basic idea is that you store the ipfs hash in the main contract of the dapp. You can then trust that the website you are visiting havn't been modified."

ethereum,3cikhl,accape,3,Wed Jul 8 09:28:36 2015 UTC,I really can't understand the conflicting information.  Not to sound negative but founders .. make sure you keep an ear open to the naysayers and don't get stuck in an echochamber.  Seems pointless and weird to change how you're going to launch with a random reply to a reddit question.
ethereum,3cikhl,playingethereum,3,Wed Jul 8 08:51:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly agree that its a little unclear, but because its a lot of moving parts and jargon spread out over many months, not because of poor communication. This really needs to be simplified into an easy-to-reference table (like the slide shown in one of the recent meetups) that includes the major phases and milestones with multicolored highlighting that says ""you are here"". It would take a 5 minute whip-up and be infinitely valuable."
ethereum,3cikhl,ddink7,3,Wed Jul 8 11:33:59 2015 UTC,"I agree...too much has changed to rely on months'-old blog posts. I seem to recall the original date being March 20--nearly four months ago. If we all went by old information from the devs, we'd all be confused!!!"

Two weeks waiting just because they said it once is weird. People change, policy changes and I prefer the 2-day signal. So when it comes, call your friends who also like Ethereum and celebrate here on Reddit."

Hence (perhaps in error) I've steered away from discussing the options we're considering and soliciting for opinions, rather waiting for the internal process to settle before making new announcements.  A lot of what I'm doing right now is maintaining the final checklist of things which need to be done (non-technical stuff, mostly) and ticking things off as they come in.  Close. That's all I can say. Close."
ethereum,3cikhl,etherminer24,2,Wed Jul 8 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"Can ethdev consider at least a one week warning?    That should give everyone enough time to come here and ask relevant questions.  Think about the 9000+ people who bought ether in the sale who are going to want to know how to make a transaction and send them to exchanges, etc.  It will also give miners time to setup, etc.  And, of course, news sources will pick up the annoucement and there will be a ton of press and anticipation for the launch."
ethereum,3cikhl,luffintlimme,-2,Wed Jul 8 06:52:06 2015 UTC,"It feels a bit weird that you are begging for it to be put off. So if it was ready now, instead of 7/10/15, you'd like it to be launched 7/22/15? Sorry, but I'd like it as soon as possible! There will be the things you mentioned regardless. Testnet has been up at least 2 weeks before today, so it's not like somehow they had their hands tied from getting ready."

ethereum,3cikhl,ddink7,6,Wed Jul 8 11:38:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, yes. I'd like them to stress test the ""final"" version of the Go client for a reasonable period before releasing. Too many show-stopping bugs have been found in Olympic, and a livenet fork could be  severely damaging, even with checkpointing."
ethereum,3cikhl,hexayurt,7,Wed Jul 8 12:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yep. And an awful lot has changed in the various moving parts since the original Frontier / Homestead / Olympic posts.  Here's basically where we are:  1) everything is connected to everything else - consider how complex checkpointing is, in theory, and how much difficulty piles up against it when you consider function on things like exchanges.  2) bugs are being found at an ever-decreasing rate. how close is that to the damn near zero defect that we need for the core functionality of the clients? we've got really big, solid docs from the auditors, and an awful lot of very careful work on the code base, but at what point do you decide ""go!""  3) the non-technical side. Ethereum's about 2/3 coders, and three CTOs and no CEO. as you can imagine, we're sometimes slower than we should be to worry about non-technical factors. So as we've gotten closer to release, more and more non-technical stuff (and support technology like the stats site) has come up as being an urgent need before we can ship.  4) A lot of this comes down to the politics of confidence. We'd like to be sure, but we'd also like to be soon. Different people in the org have different ideas about what ""finally ready to release"" looks like, not much different in theory, but in practice getting a consensus about being ready to go is hard, with so much done and so much at stake.  So right now we're in the final stage of balancing all of that. Part of the reason I haven't been as active on the blog as you'd like is because in many cases the blog post is the final form of agreement on these kinds of issues - once we're all totally sure, we make public the status of the agreement. The more definitive the information, the longer it can take to get that level of certainty, and so comms have slowed the closer we get to the actual launch.  I'm sorry it's working like that: it's far from ideal, but that's where we are.  I'm trying to break that logjam right now."

ÐOUG was/is awesome, but it's been over a year and ÐOUG has been abandoned, but it's the best ÐAO model I've seen to date.      Ethereum has become a hierarchical, opaque, centralized, chaosization.

Lots of well-meaning people would assume that my ATM bank was the only legitimate source of money.  For reference, ""coinbase"" or ""etherbase"" is technically the genesis transaction of any block - when new coins are mined they are awarded to the coinbase account. There's no real difference between the way this works in bitcoin and ethereum, but it helped to rename it in ethereum because of the company with the confusing name.

ethereum,3cehej,johnmountain,4,Tue Jul 7 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"Contracts can be composed, but safe cooperation between mutually-distrusting parties will require careful study and rigorous defensive programming. Some changes to the virtual machine could be made to improve the safety of these compositions, and higher-level analysis tools must be developed. The programming examples included in serpent and found in the wild are flawed and inadequate for demonstrating best practices.   I think the point of modifiers in Solidity is that they make defensive programming significantly easier. You can do ""system"" validation checks per contract entry point without any developer overhead (a little extra compiler support would go a long way though). I expect that the functional unit will not be a contract but a standard contract system consisting of a (possibly dynamic) interface/actor contract, a kernel contract, and a dynamic set of implementation contracts.

ethereum,3cehej,HardToScale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:08:39 2015 UTC,How is that abnormal?  I think what you need is a real hash rate. Not the one seen the network. Having higher hash rate of course will give you an advantage. What we need to ensure is that the advantage is linear. The only way to do this is ask every single miner to provides data   How many GPUs do they run? How many MH/s each GPU provides. Compare that to the number of block they are getting. Is it proportional?   Don't forget you will also need to take into account the latency/block propagation time. I'm not really sure where you can get this.
ethereum,3cehej,throwaway36256,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why  I used only observed block time of each miner. It's give a global idea about the miner without knowing to much features about the miner.  Many points can be concluded from observed block time ( implicitly is informative about the real hash rate and the confounding )   by using some statistics. If more features are easy to get, these will be used as covariates in a general machine learning model.   But I rather prefer to use only the observed block time to shape an understanding about the mining process in Ethereum without using more fancy features that easily can produce biased conclusions."

Hard to have one answer, let's discuss these two miners:  1) 75d12319f9203a983f6773355194412d1a73d820: From 2015-06-15 21:42:24 to 2015-06-30 17:37:56, mined 25945,  90% of them during each minute.

The actual mining process is making some miners rich in a short lapse of time.   Let's assume that the reward is 50$  for each block ( a kind of imagination) : 25945*50=1297250 $ in two weeks.  More than one million in two weeks."
ethereum,3cehej,HardToScale,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"Like I said. You are totally ignoring the latency. According to stats.ethdev, under load only less than 20% of the block reaches peer within 0.5 s(~20 %actually reaches peer in more than 10s, that's one block time). That means most of the time large miner have at least 16% advantage vs small one. You are putting too much blame onto the difficulty adjustment by ignoring a larger factor that plays a part.  Besides that, they might actually have that high of a hash rate, you never know."
ethereum,3cehej,throwaway36256,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing:   If the 2 consecutive blocks are produced by 2 different miners, they might be out of sync, the difference can be up to a minute.

ethereum,3cehej,throwaway36256,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"You are putting too much blame onto the difficulty adjustment by ignoring a larger factor that plays a part.   As I told you block time has many factors, it's not only time spent to mine the block. I'm totally aware about it. For my analysis the block time helped to do some analysis about the miner without asking fancy features.  What I blame more, first the decided short time and second the factors used to update the difficulty, are the factors taking into consideration the observed exponential process? I don't think so as the factors are just pure magical constant, why not to update the difficulty as D(t+1)= D(t)+ F(t) where F(t) is depending explicitly on time. Ethereum just considers it implicitly depending on time and it's a function with two magical  constants, any rational?  The difficulty adjustment needs factors(t) controlling the change in the difficulty over an increment of time, the change in the difficulty should not be wild enough. The current adjustment showed much wilder fluctuations.  I wish if Ethereum have decided 5 thresholds, one using 8 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes, to assess the current difficulty adjustment accordingly to the increment of time."

The sections about defensively writing contracts are especially useful to dapp devs. The recommendation for a receiver sequence number is obvious (in hindsight). And I'd hope to see the pointer to object capability research make its way back into solidity/serpent documentation.  Also worth mentioning is CRDTs. The basic idea is that instead of e.g. adding new ids to a namereg contract by pushing to an array (so the element index matters), new ids are added to a set (so the order of the elements doesn't matter). Not all contracts could use CRDT's (sometimes a particular message sequence is necessary), but the ones that could use them wouldn't need to check a receiver seqnum. iirc somebody was asking for this here before, by requesting a union data type in solidity."

ethereum,3cb8sq,heliumcraft,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:44:52 2015 UTC,"Regarding ""ripoff"", no code was taken from embark.  The TestRPC isn't a part of Truffle, and never will be. Truffle will let you run your tests and your code against any RPC client, whether that's the TestRPC (for speed), geth, or eth.   Another goal is its robust asset pipeline. You don't want to use CoffeeScript? Truffle allows you to use Javascript. You want to use ES6 before it's actually released? Great, Truffle's built in a way that supports Babel. You want your frontend to use JSX files for React, or Jade templates, or handlebars, or Ember? Ya, Truffle can do that too.  These are just a few goals, but there are many more.   Are you one of the main developers of Embark?"

ethereum,3cb8sq,aedigix,0,Tue Jul 7 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"We're all excited about the Ethereum release. :)  Here are a couple technical issues I had with Embark that made me want to write a different tool rather than convince others to make a change:    geth is an official dependency for the framework, and is highly coupled within the framework. geth is slow during development (12s block times = 12s transaction times), and my laptop overheats while mining. embark blockchain is meant to overcome this, but I don't like that solution technically. The right one, IMO, is to become RPC agnostic and use something like the TestRPC. pythereum is an official dependency for testing. Both the TestRPC and EtherTDD use pythereum as a backend, but with Truffle, you can also (and if you desire, only) run your tests on geth or eth. More importantly than pythereum, however, is the ability to run tests on geth or eth when needed: These are what our users are going to use, so we want to make sure our contracts run on them. This feature was a result of first hand experience where my app and contracts worked on the TestRPC but not on geth. solc is an official dependency for compiling contracts. When using Truffle you need solc as well (indirectly), but Truffle compiles contracts using the RPC, and therefore will more easily support other contract languages. Truffle makes up for issues with Solidity's (currently) incomplete import statement. For instance, when using Solidity contracts in Truffle, Truffle will resolve imports allowing you to write contract code that's more extensible and decoupled.  Embark has a rigid frontend structure. For instance, in Truffle, you can delete the javascript and stylesheets directory and organize your project's frontend exactly how you want. This is a deal breaker for some projects. Truffle makes no assumptions about how the frontend will be deployed. You could deploy the frontend on static code via traditional web servers, or via IPFS if you choose, but this isn't Truffle's job. Instead, Truffle aims to stay neutral and not support any deployment architecture out of the box (and by compiling everything down to flat files, in essence, it supports all). The reasoning for this is that the deployment architectures for Ethereum projects are so varied and uncertain that Truffle shouldn't hold stake in any specific one. We'll leave that up to other tools to figure out. As mentioned above, testing runs via real RPC clients, so there's no stubbing or complete reliance on client's that aren't actually being used by our users.  Via Pudding, the code you write to communicate with your contracts inside your app is the same code you write to communicate with your contracts inside your tests. There's no need to think differently or use a different API. It's all web3, with some added niceties to ensure your transactions are processed on the blockchain before continuing. As mentioned, the pipeline allows you to use any number of templating engines and languages (Babel, JSX, Handlebars, HAML, SASS, CoffeeScript -- nearly anything you can think of) with little effort. See some examples here: https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle#extending-the-pipeline   So as you can see, there were a lot of technical differences that caused me (not Consensys) to write something new. If I'm wrong on some of these points, I'd love for you to show me how I can perform (or avoid) the above with Embark.

You can concat contracts in embark (I do this myself), albeit yeah could update the docs on this Not totally true. can be configured. Embark makes no assumptions either. again, the test part is there for convenience but you can use a real rpc client. Pudding is nice. I have some doubts about the implementation as there are other ways. but overall it's nice. Embark can do the same. It simplifies things a bit too much perhaps, but everything can be overwritten.

Blockchain: a distributed database. Consensus mechanism: this protects the database by solving cryptographic equations and hashing. Mining: a global network of computers that accumulate new transaction, run the consensus mechanism and print blocks on the blockchain every 12 seconds approximately. Programmability: unlike Bitcoin, on Ethereum you can store software programs, called smart contracts. These can control accounts, money, and do operations like any program, but autonomously. This is THE critical innovation IMHO. Virtual machine: but the programs above need to be executed somewhere! So all the computers that participate in the network work as a single machine as if they were a specialized cloud service like AWS or Bluehost. Mist browser: is like the Bitcoin Core client, but it's like a browser and you can use decentralized applications built on Ethereum through this one.

In the Ethereum code however, the variable related to block time appears to be 8 seconds.   In actuality Bitcoin block times follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 10 min. It could be that by setting Ethereum's ""DurationLimit"" to 8 seconds, that achieves an exponential distribution of block times with a mean at 12 seconds. The graphs provided might support that.

If we show that the distribution is following exponential distribution for each miner, that will be a step forward for many conclusions. For instance min( Mexp1,Mexp2,Mexp3, ... , Mexpn) is also an exponential distribution with intensity equals to sum of their intensities. Then it will be more suitable to characterize the Ethereum distribution by the one deducted from the miners distributions and comparing it  to the one you observed, if any discrepancy that needs to be explained carefully."

ethereum,3c6qbi,jmiehau,5,Sun Jul 5 10:49:14 2015 UTC,"Great blog post, sooo much content. My best part was the following quote:   The Athenians had a straightforward solution to the problem of producing public goods such as the maintainance of a warship or the organizing of a public festival. If you were one of the richest Athenians, every two years you were obligated to produce a public good; the relevant magistrate would tell you which one. “As you doubtless know, we are sending a team to the Olympics this year. Congratulations, you are the sponsor.” Or “Look at that lovely trireme down at the dock. This year guess who gets to be captain and paymaster.” Such an obligation was called a liturgy. There were two ways to get out of it. One was to show that you were already doing another liturgy this year or had done one last year. The other was to prove that there was another Athenian, richer than you, who had not done one last year and was not doing one this year. This raises an obvious puzzle. How, in a world without accountants, income tax, public records of what people owned and what it was worth, do I prove that you are richer than I am? The answer is not an accountant’s answer but an economist’s—feel free to spend a few minutes trying to figure it out before you turn the page. The solution was simple. I offer to exchange everything I own for everything you own. If you refuse, you have admitted that you are richer than I am, and so you get to do the liturgy that was to be imposed on me.   Damn greeks have thought of everything"
ethereum,3c6qbi,d11e9,3,Sun Jul 5 11:38:26 2015 UTC,"It's a fun concept. Except, you may not want to exchange due to sentimental values. What if the house you grew up is far more important to you than anyone else? And you want your kids to grow up in it too, so you refuse to exchange even if you are poorer.  Money is not everything in life."

""This mechanism relies on the existence of a specific currency, ETH""   The argument about Bitcoin for a very long time has been that there is no intrinsic value beyond just a unit of account; though lacking intrinsic value, even fiat US dollars are enforceable via government edict and by military force.  However, Eth does have intrinsic value, unlike Bitcoin, as a fuel to execute contracts, and more readily transferable than any currency."

I dont know the answer but i think eth has a closer representation of value due to its broad utilitarian function."
ethereum,3c6qbi,worldcoinninja,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:20:50 2015 UTC,Let's assume this:  Eth has an intrinsic value with these features: 0) divisibility ( by design) 1) medium of exchange ( ? ) 2) store of value (?) 3) securely storable (?)  4) transportable ( by design ) ;  5) scarcity ( by design)  6)  difficulty to counterfeit (?)

Because to become a competent programmer is to see them for what they are: tools, some are good for inserting nails into wood others are not.  That being said, solidity looks to be the primary language so far  - it's a typed version of what looks JavaScript/C-like.  I personally got most use out of one of the earlier ones: LLL, I'd never coded with a lisp before and found it both enlightening and simple.  Also worth noting is that /u/vbuterin developed a pythonesque language called serpent, and I hear tonnes of people think Python is a great tool to learn first.

ethereum,3c6sun,vaXzine,3,Sun Jul 5 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"Solidity is the flagship language for the utilizing the VM in order to manipulate data on the ethereum blockchain. It borrows concepts from both C++ and javascript. That said, it would behoove you to get an intro/overview to C++ in order to understand some of the basic data structures and design principles behind the language. Solidity uses concepts like structs,visibility specification, modifiers, polymorphism and inheritance to enable complex relationships between modules in system design (some of which are not explicitly available in javascript, unless you simulate it). Once you grok solidity, you should be able  to learn javascript pretty easily and on your way to dapping it up!

ethereum,3c2qv8,PhilWearn,2,Sat Jul 4 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"It occurs to me that I'm not sure how one would keep players hands secret.  Each player must have no control over what cards they draw, but no other player can be able to determine what cards they have, and they have to be able to prove what cards they have at some later point...  Hmm...  Well it could be done with a secret sharing DAO, like Enigma, but that feels like it might be using a sledgehammer to kill a housefly.  I'm pretty sure someone's figured out how to do this, but I don't know how.  Well, the contract cannot deal the cards directly in any case, because then anyone could see them, so the cards have to be ""dealt"" by either a trusted ""dealer"", or by one or more other players, in such a way that the other player(s) don't have control over the outcome.  Ok, one potential solution I just thought of:  Based on some other random data generating contract, the contract gets some random data (which is public)  Each player chooses two randomish things of data (these would be computed in the background by the client program, but if they were to choose it themselves instead , it should not be a problem). They combine these with the public random data in a specific way (say, they append the two) for each of the two things of data that they produced, and from each combination they take a hash. They commit these two hashes with the contract.  ....  Oh, wait, that Is more complicated than it needs to be, and has an extra flaw.  Instead, each player deals their own cards, in a way that they cannot control the result.  As before, the contract gets some public random data from another contract. Then, each player chooses some randomish data. Each player combines the data they picked with the public random data, and then hashes the result, and commits the result with the contract. Then the contract gets another section of data, either from the random data generating contract, or by combining the commits of each player, and hashing the combination. Then, each person combines this with the randomish data they chose earlier, and hashes the result.  This is their personal random data, and they interpret it as their hand (alternatively, they use it as a seed for a rng, and use the output of that as their hand).  Then poker stuff happens until someone needs to reveal their hand, at which point they reveal the randomish data they chose earlier, which the contract verifies with the hash they committed earlier, and then generates the data they got for their hand, and uses that to confirm that all the moves they made were valid.  I am not super familiar with the rules for poker, but I am guessing that this might be missing a few things, because at some points someone may exchange cards?  This method would have to be modified somewhat if one wanted to be able to prove that they have a particular card, without revealing their entire hand, but I think that could be done using a tree of hashes?  Yeah, in the randomish data each person chooses, split it into as many parts as they need to draw cards. Make a Merkel tree of this, and the value one commits with the contract would instead be the hash of the head of the Merkel tree along with the public random data.  When determining the random data for each card, hash the corresponding part of the randomish data one chose along with the second thing of public random data, and an ID of which card in the hand it is (so that one cannot e.g. garuntee that one gets 6 of a kind by making each section of the randomish data the same). (One can insure that one does not lie about the card ID because the position in the Merkel tree also has that information)  Then, to prove to the contract, or another player, that one has a given card at a particular spot in one's hand, one includes the Merkel tree proof for the corresponding section of randomish data one chose.  ...  Actually, a Merkel tree might be still a bit much to use for this, because the number of cards is always small? It might make more sense to make it so the verifying party only needs to hash 2 things by basically using a Merkel tree with 1 layer with as many branches as there are cards? Yeah, that might be good.  Also, the first public random data might not be necessary.  Limitations of this system:  When drawing cards, the cards are not ""removed from the deck"", because they are all calculated seperately.  When doing a thing where one's cards go to someone else, it works I think, but one has to give the card to a specific person, instead of e.g. putting it into a pile that goes around. It might be possible to add something onto it to add that, but it would probably be complicated, and would probably reveal to the receiver who the card came from?  It might be possible to get around that though, through a system where whenever someone adds a card to a pile, they prove that to someone who will not get anything else from the pile, who puts their card in the spot in the pile, and  does a thing to prove that they only added cards? In thinking that wouldn't quite work. Maybe a keeping a collection of cards in the pile which points to a previous version of the pile ? (this would be stored only by the player, not the contract)  A number of other limitations, possibly including the scheme being totally broken.  I don't think so, but I am sleepy, so I'm not totally sure.  If anyone would tell me whether this system seems sound and efficient, that would be appreciated."

Blockchain: a distributed database. Consensus mechanism: this protects the database by solving cryptographic equations and hashing. Mining: a global network of computers that accumulate new transaction, run the consensus mechanism and print blocks on the blockchain every 12 seconds approximately. Programmability: unlike Bitcoin, on Ethereum you can store software programs, called smart contracts. These can control accounts, money, and do operations like any program, but autonomously. This is THE critical innovation IMHO. Virtual machine: but the programs above need to be executed somewhere! So all the computers that participate in the network work as a single machine as if they were a specialized cloud service like AWS or Bluehost. Mist browser: is like the Bitcoin Core client, but it's like a browser and you can use decentralized applications built on Ethereum through this one.

It's not fast but it's fast enough to run anything that requires decentralized consensus like storing the hash/location of a file stored in some decentralized P2P based file storage like swarm which is another component to Ethereum.

For instance, using the id dapp for voting, there might be a requirement for users to revalidate via another web conference in order to receive their vote token or be authenticated to vote. So it's not a ""buy identity once"" and use it forever, but the malicious actor would need to have an ongoing, and hopefully costly, relationship with all the people behind the identities they are controlling. Additionally, it might be possible for the network of users to eventually reveal these kinds of actors and vote to have them and the identities they control booted. So there's a risk for the malicious actor to lose what might be a significant investment."

I don't think ethereum can solve that by itself, but it certainly can be used to create a system that incentivizes validation, keeps tracks of reputations and rewards verifications, whether that is done by a person, company or machine.

But you actually may want to read it :) It is not an idolization of Austrian economics. I find the Austrian perspective very helpful and refreshing but it has its blind spots that I tried to point out in the paper..."
ethereum,3bwf5y,vbuterin,3,Fri Jul 3 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"Mises was a very good author at explaining basic principles and at exposing many kinds of fallacies; the Bryan Caplan FAQ basically says that Austrian thought was quite deservedly influential for shaping early economics, but simply hasn't kept up with more advanced models that have made a number of more subtle points both for and against libertarianism (particularly in my opinion: Lucas' rational-expectations model of central bank inflation targeting, Stiglitz' wage efficiency model, signalling theory, public choice theory, imperfect/monopolistic competition), and that mainstream economics has done a decent job of accepting the good parts (the problem with the world really being that politicians haven't accepted economics).  Let me see if I can go through this more thoroughly and find more blind spots :)   The Austrian philosophy, which has a normative foundation, is one possible set of such cultural rules.    This is actually incorrect; Mises went at length to point out that the purpose of the discipline of economics is to describe what will happen, not what should happen. It's worth methodologically separating Austrian economics from moral principles, which for Austrian economists are usually either Rothbard-libertarianism or preference utilitarianism (ie. Kaldor-Hicks utility maximization with or without concern for equity depending on who you're taking to).   One might argue that argument (1) is epistemologically not valid and argument (2) is impossible to solve in practice.   It's worth noting that there are methods to figure out how much people actually value the environment; a simple one is to run a linear regression to see the relationship between various variables that correspond to quality of the environment in a particular place and the rent in that location, using rent as an indicator of how much people want to live there. Basically, measure the compensating differential. It's not perfect and you have to do hard statistics to eliminate confounding variables (eg. urbanization both hurts the environment and makes cities desirable in other ways), but measurement is quite possible in theory; as an extreme example, I'm sure you can buy up land in Chernobyl for close to $0.  Additionally, I've found people in the Austrolibertarian camp often make the mistake that because X is hard to measure, it's safe to assume as a first approximation that the value of X is zero; this is a fallacy.   costs and gains are entirely subjective and can not be measured   Once again, see the econometrics argument above.   first come first served principle    It's important to note that first-come-first-served in practice does lead to overinvestment (in the sense of ""if David Friedman's bureaucrat God forced everyone to invest 10% less, everyone would be happier"") in search expenses, since search has the negative externality of removing claiming opportunities for others (this is basically the ""land grab"" argument, though phrased in efficiency and not equity terms).   there is a partial way out. In a libertarian society, the roads would be privately owned. This means that the auto emissions would be emanating from the road of the road owner into the lungs or airspace of other citizens, so that the road owner would be liable for pollution damage to the surrounding inhabitants. Suing the road owner is much more feasible than suing each individual car owner   Assigning blame for road owners is problematic for two reasons:   Assigning blame to centralized facilitators like road owners is in fact the Coasean-optimal solution to the driver pollution problem in the absence of a government, as it reduces coordination requirements from N-to-N to N-to-1, and it's quite convenient that Rothbard's libertarian law analysis guides him toward Coasean-optimality in this case. Would it not be simpler to just take Coasean-optimality (or other efficiency sub-criteria) as one's standard of justice in the first place? Assigning second-hand blame to this extent can be very dangerous if used too much; for example, if you admit the principle that parties that facilitated a transaction by failing to regulate their customers enough are liable for the transaction, then you're basically brought in the juggernaut of modern anti-money-laundering regulation, which has contributed to making our financial systems so terrible that massively replicated database networks backed by competitive games of wasted electricity are in some cases actually superior(!!). I think libertarians in general have a blind spot in that they don't realize that some of the special legal or moral principles that they admit in a few cases, if applied expansively enough, can be used to replicate much of the modern regulatory regime (the other major example being consumer protection laws).   IMO, positive externalities are also not sufficiently treated."

ethereum,3bv3ae,vbuterin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:37:19 2015 UTC,okay jeff explained that the tx are currently ordered by nonce. imo its not the correct way. regarding game theoretically aspects the miners will choose to include the tx with the higher gas price anyway.

ethereum,3bv3ae,vbuterin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:43:44 2015 UTC,are you serious or do i miss anything? the way it is implemented now - its a showstopper. its impossible to include tx with a gas price higher than 2m. on top of that even the gas limit is not increased.
ethereum,3bv3ae,PhiStr90,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"It's impossible right now because someone is consistently spamming the blockchain with exactly 1m gas per block, in every block. I really don't think that's going to happen on mainnet."
ethereum,3bv3ae,PhiStr90,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:05 2015 UTC,Whats the reason or what are the beneficals to order it by nonce instead of by the gas price?
ethereum,3bv3ae,throwaway36256,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"Is it actually 1m? Because my client says for every tx of the 0x475... address: gas: 3141592 I tried to spam with 2m gas tx and this should work anyway if the address really sends 1m. But it doesnt work. So there is a bug. Either on netstat, in the client tx info and/or in the algo which increases the limit if the block is full."
ethereum,3bv3ae,PhiStr90,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:50:12 2015 UTC,That's what I suspected too. It is impossible for the gasLimit to stay at 1m when I'm trying to spam as well. Either the main miner forks his own to build only 1m or there is a bug. So you can confirm that you can't build 2m block?
ethereum,3bv3ae,arhuaco,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:03 2015 UTC,nope what i mean is: my geth client says that it is actually full. it says the tx is not 1m its a 3m gas tx. but the limit isnt increased altough the block is full.
ethereum,3bv3ae,vbuterin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:42:43 2015 UTC,Should we keep spamming?
ethereum,3bv3ae,PhiStr90,2,Fri Jul 3 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend stop spamming a single 1m gas transaction per block, and do ten 100k gas transactions per block.

ethereum,3bv3ae,throwaway36256,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:34:26 2015 UTC,and ordering by gas price and then include as much tx as possible is as easy as ordering by nonce.
ethereum,3bv3ae,PhiStr90,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:55:20 2015 UTC,Probably time to turn your miner back on. At this rate we will never push the gas limit up  Edit: I'm guessing that guy is running his own fork of miner. Not sure how right I am though.
ethereum,3bv3ae,jeffehhh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:13:19 2015 UTC,I'll go ahead and spam 2m gas tx. i guess there will definetly a fork of the client at release. why to throw away money... and there is really no benefical I can think of to use 'ordering by nonce' instead of 'ordering by 'gas price'.
ethereum,3bv3ae,luffintlimme,2,Thu Jul 2 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"First of all you need to order by nonce, otherwise txs aren't process able. Ordering by gas price does NOT guarantee the highest possible outcome. Imagine a tx to contract A, contract A would consume 15000 gas. We also have contract B, consumes 20 gas. We got 2 txs, one with a gas price of 1szabo, gas limit 1m and its being send towards contract A. Other txs goes towards B with a higher gas price, 10 szabo and same gas limit.   See that doesn't work. Favoring the second over the first txs would have yielded you a much lower result!   This isn't as simple as ""some easy ordering by"". This requires actual analysis and as /u/vbuterin already said, not a deliverable for Frontier."

It wouldn't surprise me if some great minds will build a bridge between the 2. I wrote an article about that on the Maidsafe forum.

Ethereum will have so many contract etc. running on their blockchain, it's gonna be very big in a couple of years. Maybe external blockchains are a good idea for SAFE, or maybe not! But there's no way to prevent other systems using SAFEnet to do this.   Sure, would be great if we could work toward this existing.

More info about the API can be found here. There's a wiki. The Roadmap can be found here. Now I'm not a Dev myself, but to me it would make great sense to use both Ethereum and SAFEnet at the same time. With Bitcoin etc. you still have a lot of stuff stored locally. Even the software and blockchain, wallets etc. On SAFEnet, you ""log in"" to the network, a drive is mounted, so why not store the Bitcoin-client and/or Ethereum-client on that drive. Also caching is done on SAFEnet for popular files, so when a lot of people download blocks, this should speed things up. Sending out/receiving transactions, blocks etc for Ethereum could be done in a way it's done now. So on Ethereums own p2p-infrastructure. Only the storage for the client and the blocks would be on SAFEnet. Looks te me like a great fit. It would even allow me to go to a friends home, ""log in"" to my SAFE-account, and have all my wallets, private keys, and even my full client for Ethereum at hand in a minute."

ethereum,3brekc,TomTreeLeaf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"As far as I could see (weeks ago) the mining mechanism seems unable to understand that it is not mining the current block.  This is bizarre as it should be as simple as:  if( blockchain.last().nr < peers.max( p=>p.blockchain.last().nr ) )     miner.abort_and_start_mining_the_next_block();   In other words your miner is busy mining blocks that were mined minutes ago (hence stale) while your client is pulling blocks trying to catch up to the current block.  Or someone with a fair amount of mining power is strategically refusing to share mined blocks with other peers in a timely manner causing other peers to be constantly 1~2 blocks behind.   I think a fair amount of mining power complimented by large number of malicious nodes might be able to achieve this, but later on when the network grows this kind of attack would probably become impossible. You can still boost your odds of winning the next mine by this tactic though, regardless of network strength. I don't know I'm just guessing here."

But I can confirm that my miner behaved exactly the same for the majority of the time I was mining.  To be honest I think there was (maybe still?) a problem with block propagation in the network at the time, possibly because of my proximity to the majority of the nodes. I could see on stats.ethdev.com that my physical location had a devastating effect on my node's stats representation. My node's info was constantly ~5 seconds behind the rest and that because of a real latency of probably 200ms? This seemed excessive. The actual block delay reported by the stats page was ~2.9 seconds. Again, because of a 200ms latency as supposed to a 30ms latency for the rest it felt that my location was excessively penalized.   And I could see on the stats page that every 3rd block mined or so my miner would realize it was still on a wild goose chase.  I tried to combat this by running 4 nodes, but babysitting 4 nodes turned out to be a lot of work at the time. And it had no effect.  I gave up.  I will try again soon though and see how it goes.

For something like this I would probably try the cheapest instance first (t2.micro) and see how that works. My only worry is that the micro instance type has limited networking performance, which might affect your mining reward claims, depending on the power of your mining rig. http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/  It's hard to make a call on this. I would recommend experimenting with different instance types, e.g. how t2.micro performs against something bit more network-optimised like m4.large or m4.xlarge.  Of course, it's also useful to keep in mind that m4.large is ~10x more expensive than a micro instance. Would it give >10x more rewards? Or maybe it's better to run say 5 micros instead.   Run a micro instance for a day, record how many blocks you mined and the average hashrate of the network. Then do the same with a larger instance. Use this: Use this: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/  and you should get a pretty accurate estimate for which instance type would be most cost-efficient.  Don't forget to share your results! ;)"

But part of being older is that you develop a (false?) sense that people in other fields have accumulated some specialized expertise that you simply can't match with only one lifetime. Even with my playing-around money, I would feel more comfortable with some active guidance from expert fund managers.  Over time, if it looked like automated fund managers were outperforming live ones, I might switch to the copy-and-paste stuff, but I suspect there would be several years where I'd be more comfortable with a hybrid system that combines real-life financial advisors with a decentralized, somewhat automated SIP interface."

Etherplan's model is to provide a decentralized Smart Investment Plan (SIP) for the customer and then compete for customer business at the same level as the other providers.

Rather than collectively designating more accurate probabilities to the future performance of the underlying cashflows, it seems that individual players want to outguess other players.  As some players discover a method of better outguessing the rest, it seems the competitive forces of the rest changes the patterns and old prediction methods become obsolete.  Also, systems like Benjamin Graham's ""Mr. Market"" value investing seem to be betting on the minority side all the time rather than following the wisdom of the crowds.

There's the toy example I pulled from Paul's test repo (and a few other edge cases (8) in there) that I made a point of pointing out our new algo can do that the old algorithm can't.  And there's the Monte Carlo simulations Jack wrote.    One can make endless arguments that the ""statistical methods"" behind the monte carlo sims were flawed, and if someone has a better idea or certain types of sims they'd like us to run (as Vitalik did in his comment) we'd be delighted to run them :)  Edit/P.S.: those tests Vitalik asked for finally got done, clustering performs well on them too!"

ethereum,3bjp6s,inviolinable,2,Mon Jun 29 19:52:33 2015 UTC,Great read. I'm curious if you learned why this particular clustering method worked well for this use-case?
ethereum,3bjp6s,inviolinable,3,Mon Jun 29 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  So I think this method worked well because provided you have a modicum of honest reporters it picks up on them as the ""truth cluster"" really well (most clustering methods get this part right).  And since this method makes a lot of clusters, peripheral clusters (meaning the ones further away/less similar from/to the truth cluster) end up getting penalized very closely to the degree that they reported dishonestly."
ethereum,3bjp6s,inviolinable,2,Tue Jun 30 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"That seems very powerful. I've been working on implementing PCA for an automated research application that receives data from independent collectors. The idea was to discern between true/false effect sizes (continuous scale or above/below minimum threshold) and for personal treatment responses. Clustering would be preferred and seems remarkably robust. At a glance, would clustering generalise to this use? Are there any issues to watch out for? Can different  decision-rules be usefully run over the clustering to 'tag' different clusters?   Apologies for the quiz. It's fascinating work."
ethereum,3bjp6s,vaXzine,3,Tue Jun 30 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it should.  Clustering algorithms typically have some ""distance threshold"" to decide whether to include items in a specific cluster.    You can tag clusters.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis is a good resource on clustering.  Hierarchical and k means are most common, DBSCAN is an interesting + pretty useful clustering algo as well.  I'd just try a few from each type of algo and see what works best (might be able to rule some out immediately due to the nature of your data)."

ethereum,3be5v5,VoiceOfTheEvolution,12,Sun Jun 28 11:12:25 2015 UTC,"I do think that initial frontier release will happen before the funds run out, for the simple reason, its a way for them to get more funding through selling and issuing ether.  Personally I feel it might be no harm if the money got a bit more scarce. There might be more focus and some of the core people have said they will continue to work for free on the project. The ones that continue are the ones you want involved. Having the funds they have had up to now, has resulted in a lot of waste (like developing multiple versions, expressed in different languages and keeping them logically synchronised) which would not have happened if they had not had the crowd fund donations."
ethereum,3be5v5,dnydublin12,9,Sun Jun 28 11:27:22 2015 UTC,Implementing multiple versions in different languages is not a waste.  Multiple implementations will keep each other honest and enable a broad developer audience to get down and dirty in a way that is comfortable for them.  If at all it is a bonus.
ethereum,3be5v5,pompomJuice,8,Sun Jun 28 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Multiple implementations are great, but should have come after a basic working product was shipped. Quite probably they would have got translations into other languages for free, by other developers once the basic product was solid and stable. (I probably would have)  To illustrate, what they've done is equivalent to trying to write a novel in French, English and Chinese, keeping the manuscripts identical throughout the many changes in plot, rewrites and edits. What most people when they write novels do, is write a really good one in their preferred language and then harness the skills of a specialist translator to re-interpret into other languages once the book has been released and well received.    There are very good engineering reasons that teams do not do what the Ethereum team attempted."
ethereum,3be5v5,dnydublin12,10,Sun Jun 28 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"Retrospectively, I agree to a partial extent; if I could go back in time I would probably stick to one implementation until ~poc9 or so then make another one and make sure they match up before launching. The security benefits of having multiple clean-room implementations in sync with each other are quite substantial and helped find bugs in many places; think of one implementation as being a computer program that generates test cases for the other. A human would have taken 10-100x longer to come up with as exhaustive a test suite as we have now.  I think one of our major problems has been that we were assuming and planning as if we were 1-3 months away from launch pretty much all the way since Dec 2014."

I don't necessarily agree with this, since we're arguably creating ""mission critical"" software that must be as bug-free as possible. Block box testing is one way of going about accomplishing this, but as we've often found, the very existence of multiple implementations is what has surfaced bugs which would have otherwise led to a fork later on. In fact, sometimes the clients are written to the letter of the Yellow Paper, but it's decided that the YP itself is lacking in definition and the ""incorrect"" implementations are actually more logically consistent.  Then again, it really depends on your definition of ""basic working product"" is. To me, the PoC series was our MVP and the work being done now is fit and finish to make it usable for the general public."

Two things: 1) I have a ton of pressure from other parts of the job right now, and 2) The first post draft is pretty much complete (wound up being from another one of the team) and just waiting for some docs to be ready.  It's not on the financials - as I've said clearly, I'm not able to speak for the Foundation, being an EthDev employee. Yes, this is frustrating. No, I can't do more than ask the Foundation team to speak up.  I wish I could say more about the release process right now too! But things have to be done in sequence, coordinated, things said carefully not to create the wrong expectations and all the rest of that. Just bear with us: we're working our asses off, and we're not here to take advantage of anybody.  Good faith, please."

ethereum,3bd6ln,etherminer24,3,Sun Jun 28 03:03:04 2015 UTC,The main challenge is to handle the high load of rpc calls with geth. It requires frequent restarts as otherwise it ends up either crashing and corrupting it's database or eating up all memory on the server. Nevertheless we are working on a solution that avoids the rpc calls so things should get more stable over the coming days.

ethereum,3bbs4p,martinBrown1984,4,Sun Jun 28 12:54:49 2015 UTC,"The financial reporting I'm talking about is something that should be included in the meeting minutes for the Swiss authorities (as any Swiss Foundation ought to do). This does not inherently include revealing such information to the public, however I'm hugely in favour of this and voted to disclose line-item accounting when we took an internal poll last year.  Now, it is true that financial reporting has been delayed repeatedly. Part of the slowness is in going back through all historical transactions and ensuring the books balance completely. As we were a loosely coupled group of technologists in the beginning, we didn't have the resources in place to hire proper accountants until after the proverbial ball had started rolling. To this end, the Board has requested via resolution that financial reports of the subsidiary companies through 2014 be available within the next few weeks.  A further complication to the reporting is the fact that there are (currently) multiple companies established in multiple legal jurisdictions, each with their own accounting. This is partly unavoidable since various countries have differing requirements for doing business within their borders, however, I'm of the opinion that it was set up in the most opaque way possible and that many administrative functions could have easily been streamlined up to the headquarters in Switzerland, since ultimately the reporting must flow up to the non-profit Foundation."

ethereum,3bbs4p,MajorCavalcanti,5,Sun Jun 28 14:52:19 2015 UTC,These salaries turn me off the entire project. IMO this shows they have very little faith in the actual 'product' itself.  They got big amounts of premine that will be worth millions if they succeed. In most start-ups (stop calling Ethereum a non-profit) the founders work on very low salary. Often in the 40-60K range. Just enough to support themselves and pour the rest into the actual project.  This sheds light on why Ethereum is struggling with funds. They literally splurge
ethereum,3bbs4p,Vikingofthehill,5,Sun Jun 28 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to how much everyone get's paid since its an Open Source project.   If it is implied here that the info is needed because it is useful for a study of open source projects, that is one thing, a justification for requiring the info. In that case I suggest you contact EthDev directly.  If it is implied that, because it is an open source project, then the salaries of participating developers ""must be open"", then this is a wrong assumption.  Open source software project means that the underlying software code is open to the public to copy, use, inspect, audit, or even fork. This does not mean developers have to disclose anything else."
ethereum,3bbs4p,DonaldMcIntyre,2,Sat Jun 27 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"It is a large charity.  I would prefer to see it do open accounting.  Everyone wants them to be open, right?  For one, given how deeply investors care about the project, they need to know if it's going to boil down to good money after bad, right?  That being said, if the foundation indeed needs a bailout, I believe that investors would prefer if they could earmark their money so it gets spent appropriately."
ethereum,3bbs4p,EtherPonzi,3,Sun Jun 28 09:47:59 2015 UTC,"I am one of Ethereum investors, buying in 2014. My main worry is for project to complete. At least Frontier+Homestead. The team is doing a great job, must be compensated, if possible. But is it a worry,  what-if the project runs out of funds. Would we have to run funding round C ? (A was loan, B was IPO in 2014) One of the problems, is that Bitcoin crashed from (@ $600/BTC) to ($200), bringing down funding $18 million IPO to $6 million only. Personally I lost huge amount of money on this Bitcoin crash, but I didn't sell any. If this project will have a funding issue, it will be really bad outcome. Possibly, further delays of Frontier will force this project to either cut costs, or seek a new round C. (If Frontier is not released this year, by Dec 31st, 2015, investors might lose interest,  and write-down this investment, as I would).  -Technologov"
ethereum,3bbs4p,Technologov,4,Sun Jun 28 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"Hi technologov, Maybe I can step in as a neutral third party here. I don't think I would be that concerned if I was you: I just covered this company for an article (go see it at MarxRand.com if you like) and the company seemed very conservative about its spending to me. Then again, it's not really this reason I would not be worried so much as it is this next bit I am about to say (which is where my experience lies - fund raising):  I say this next bit as someone who has raised significant funds for private (technology included) companies and built the largest small-cap corporate broker in the UK at one point in the capacity of Head of Private Clients from initial revenue of just $500k (something pathetic like that) to many millions. When I was last in the game in 2008 I raised several million dollars (I was in fact one of the only people to do this for a public company - single handedly - that year) and made a fair amount of cash on three similar deals before moving to Asia. (Today that company is growing at 30% and re-hiring, so I have some experience with these things). Believe me, there are PLENTY of funding options open to Ethereum, and this should be the very last of your worries. Hell, if they needed the money that badly they could just call me and I could most likely get them $10m within a pretty reasonable time frame (assuming it was a sensible valuation obviously) - and I am not even in the business any more. There are lots of people much bigger than I am about with major investors who'd love to a RIPO an IPO a partial mezz a number of deals on this baby ...  Investors at this stage tend to (in my experience) get really bogged down with the detail of the various fundraising and the market etc., too. I understand that - after all, it's your money at stake. But at the end of the day these things very rarely matter in my honest opinion and experience so much as the big picture does. If the big picture is still there, you can sell the dream ANY number of ways.  I am fascinated to see this type of dialog goes on though, especially on public forums ... a while ago I actually thought of moving to NY or SF maybe and setting up as an umbrella arrangement with an existing BD a kind of fundraising / analysis / research (corp finance) house for private VC-funded projects that are Seed, Series B and Series C fundings (your hardest basically). You make me wonder whether I shouldn't think more seriously about it over the summer.  Anyway, my point was that I can tell you personally that if I did such a venture anyway these guys would be one of my first calls probably. Doesn't matter what Bitcoin is doing - it's survived the course of 5 years and that makes investors think ""hmm, maybe we should get some money in the next Bitcoin now"" (that is EXACTLY how the sales pitch works, by the way - very rarely does it concern lots of technical stuff other than the financial outlook and meeting the management etc.)  Anyway, I hope this helps to give you a neutral opinion (I have no personal stake in the outcome of any private securities or Crypto for the record).

ethereum,3bazw1,throwaway36256,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:48:59 2015 UTC,The ability to reverse attack is just the side effect. The actual reason for checkpoint is to protect investor from accidental fork. The side effect is less security needed

There are not 100 thousands of GPUs waiting for mining. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/elastic.asp  Ethereum Miners are willing to setup their miners, even if it is 10% of reward because they don´t want to miss the train for Homestead. We are going to test our rigs like on a warm up for a race, to be fully competent on Homestead release.  Controlled checkpoints on Frontier are de facto warning tones for bad actors. It discourages bad behaviors from black hackers.  Frontier is still beta, if you are not a ninja I truly not recommend you to play on the first release.

Are we going to have the standard issuance range since Frontier? Or a percentage of the standard issuance?

ethereum,3b839x,koeppelmann,5,Fri Jun 26 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"This is an issue... Might be wrong, but here's how I think about it:   1) As the block gets filled up, you mine it as if the rest of the gas is filled up by you. Let's say it cost 10 eth to fill up the rest. You get all 10 eth back as fees and you bloated up a random contract you own with storage. 2) You can't make a profit from returning gas, only use it cut gas costs on a specific transaction. So, as the miner, you decide to a do transaction, and you issue it THROUGH the bloat contract (forwarding msg.data onwards to the actual contract), and specify how much you want to delete. It does, saving gas costs as much as you want. So let's say that tx costs 4 eth, and you can then specify enough storage to delete that saves 3 eth. 3) It still cost you 1 eth to do, BUT that 3 eth is free savings, since you paid nothing to get it. 4) Once that is depleted, you just fill it up again.    The only problem, as a miner, is that if you do this, you forego getting new money from other transactions (not your own). So economically, if blocks are relatively full and competitive then the fees should be worth more than the gas cost savings of you bloating it yourself. For blocks that aren't full, it seems there will then be always incentive to fill it with bloat?"
ethereum,3b839x,sir_talkalot,2,Sat Jun 27 10:44:28 2015 UTC,"Heres how I believe this would work: 1. Miner adds bloat tx to every block he works on, but never broadcasts the tx 2. When the miner finds a valid block, he broadcasts the block 3. Miner later uses that tx for gas refund   The problem is in step 2. There's no guarantee the broadcast block won't end up an uncle. If it's an uncle, other miners can see the bloat tx and try to mine it in their next block, claiming the gas fee. So step 2 only works probabilisticly. Im sure theres some math that can be done to figure out at what probability (of broadcasting an uncle) the attack is worthwhile."
ethereum,3b839x,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,2,Sat Jun 27 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"If it's a single miner on 'ideally linked' network, then yes, uncles can't be predicted, but there are surely ways to manipulate the uncle rate. So, this is something to consider in one of those attacks. This 'block stuffing' is just another means of recouping the cost of a class of attacks, not really an attack in its own right."
ethereum,3b839x,afdudley,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, yes. Uncles are an issue here. It reduces the effectiveness of this."
ethereum,3b839x,sir_talkalot,2,Sat Jun 27 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"You don't get ether back by deleting contract storage. Rather, if a particular transaction has delete operations in it, then those operations can cover the cost of other operations. So if for example an Augur user sends a transaction that computes some bets, but also deletes some data from contract storage, then up to half his gas fees can be covered by the 'refunded' gas from the delete operations."
ethereum,3b839x,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"I know. But miners could do a transactions that: a) deletes some of the bloat, and then b) does a trade on a prediction market."
ethereum,3b839x,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,2,Fri Jun 26 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"The miner would still pay ether to do that transaction, so eventually he will run out of ether to spam with, just like anybody else. If for example he pays 4 eth to store bloat data, then later does a transaction which would cost 10 eth but also deletes the bloat data, the transaction could ultimately cost 8 eth due to the refunded gas. In the end, the miner effectively lost 2 eth from the spam."
ethereum,3b839x,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"well, the idea is to only create the bloat if the miner finds a block anyway. Then he would just collect the fees. He could create the bloat a no costs."

It reminds me of someone like McDonald's going ""but we are the biggest"" in defence of serving shitty hamburgers ...  For a start, scale is not a big problem in and of itself necessarily; just because it is one that is about ""scale"" doesn't mean it is intrinsically that ""big"" of a problem, or that hard to solve (it's actually very much an end-run around the tracks from a dev pov as far as I can ascertain, anyway). Second, why not try instead to improve the ""core development"" (i.e. intrinsic multipurpose use) of your own blockchain rather than constantly banging on about there being a ""scaling problem"" with Ethereum; at the end of the day this ""scaling problem"" is nothing more than a theory for which you have ZERO evidence to back it up, anyway? (I believe Ethereum's developers have said they are ""testing"" this and other areas of the Blockchain: if you consider testing a problem then we have a different definition of problem!)  Sorry, it just strikes me as the less powerful of issues as a journalist to write about when discussing this topic. For example, have you read any of the other comments here? Do you understand the complexity with which this community is engaging the subject matter of a Blockchain? And you think it will ultimately be stopped by a ""scaling problem"". You need to revise your history, my friend - that has NEVER happened in the course of history (at least post 1790, since we've been Industrializing, that is ...)  As an aside, I did not come to this expecting to be so impressed by Ethereum, by the way - I am - and was - very neutral, maybe even a bit skeptical at first. There is no reason for me not to be otherwise - I have nothing at stake either in Bitcoin succeeding or Ethereum or whatever other Blockchain succeeding. I want to state that for the record here.   That's why you can see from the story itself how it was I became impressed: at first it was a human thing, and then it was a technological thing, and then a theoretical/financial thing. Generally, when you add these together and you do that well you have ... scale ... which means, even a glitch in the system is ironed out eventually.  But most of all, I cannot understand why people who are a fan of Bitcoin's Blockchain (OR ANY OTHER Blockchain for that matter) would want to create the impression that there was a scaling problem at all (which we have established just now is unfounded). While Ethereum's Blockchain is admittedly several times more sophisticated than Bitcoin's Blockchain, that is not necessarily a bad thing for Bitcoin or any other Crypto. In fact, it's a very good thing as it will ultimately flesh the network out.   It's comments like this that you never used to get in this space 2-3 years ago that make me think a lot of progress in Crypto in general is slowed down by a certain amount of amateur participation at crucial junctures of the whole value configuration process. I apologize if you are a professional, but if you are, I urge you just to stop wasting any time on something I am confident enough to promise you will not prove to be much more than forum gossip.

Building decentralization-ready apps is much faster than building decentralized apps, and by being more agile in the beginning you'll save yourself a lot of work rewriting and rearchitecting.  Bet on containers  Build your software with containers in mind. We strongly believe that containers will be the go-to solution for hosting in the future and by extension for decentralized applications as well. They provide an important component of a universal attested hosting protocol.  Within the container space, we're most excited about Kubernetes, which is the most mature feature-complete open-source container platform we could find (as of June 2015.)  Decentralize the old-fashioned way  Codius is just a way to make decentralization easier - it's an optimization, you don't need it. Find partners who will run your software for you and publicly vouch that they are running a specific version and not letting you access the servers.  Make noise  Our biggest challenge with Codius was to demonstrate real demand. If you are running a decentralized service and attested hosting would simplify your life, make sure you talk about it.  Equally, if you're a hosting company and you want to offer managed hosting for the purpose of decentralization, make sure people know about it.  If there is demand and corresponding supply there is an obvious incentive for somebody to capitalize on this opportunity."

Their initial bad reputation and low popularity (2013-2014) I think was due, in part, to a bad communication strategy or lack thereof.  As a blogger at Naation.com it has always been easy to find reference people and influencers to interview or talk and email privately. This has made it easy for me to write reviews and detailed articles about their products, services, and protocols.  Ethereum is a good example, I have interviewed Vitalik several times, have spoken, emailed, or interviewed with William Mougayar, Stephan Tual, George Hallam, and more recently Alex Van de Sande, among others.

That said, I've talked to top-level Ripple executives multiple times and they tend to toe the line that they're not looking to target the crypto/tech/enthusiast community at all, they're targeting mainstream finance because that's where the opportunities to make a really big impact are, and mainstream finance doesn't care either way as long as the product is regulatory-compliant and it works - in fact, they find the central XRP distribution quite logical.

ethereum,3b1o71,drcode,2,Thu Jun 25 12:34:04 2015 UTC,"In videos/posts the core team has talked about hybrid POW/POS systems at length. However, my impression is there will be very little (if any) POW in the planned POS algorithm for ethereum at this point.  Of course, one of the advantages of hybrid POW/POS is that it helps in distributing the initial currency... and by that measure, ethereum meets the definition of hybrid POW/POS already (just one after the other though, instead of both at the same time :-)"
ethereum,3b1o71,avsa,-1,Thu Jun 25 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"the advantages of hybrid POW/POS is that it helps in distributing the initial currency   PoW is really not an ideal distribution algorithm, we can certainly come up with better ones using Ðapps. If we could measure somehow the amount of users/gini coefficient then we could even simply put all in a futarchy using that as a long term goal."
ethereum,3b1o71,drcode,0,Thu Jun 25 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"Well, we have lots of empirical data regarding POW distribution, and zero empirical data regarding dapp currency distribution, so I don't think it's fair to conclude dapps are ""better"" at this point, even if POW has clear problems. Luckily, we should have some empirical data along these lines in the near future to compare the two mechanisms in a better way.  (But again, I'm not saying all currency should be distributed with POW, just that maybe 20%-30% distribution via POW might have some positive benefit, which is very close to what ethereum may have once Serenity is released.)"
ethereum,3b1o71,avsa,0,Thu Jun 25 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Currency distribution is a good colateral effect of PoW, not it's main function. Bitcoin pays for hashes because they are useful for its security, if suddenly hashes aren't used anymore on Ethereum then why should we pay for them?   We could probably even create a proof of work Ðapp, that would create challenges and the first user to submit an answer would win a reward, but then it would be a literal waste of computing power.

ethereum,3b1o71,avsa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"Agree. But even after the move to PoS I'm publicly for to keep the same issuance rate, but figure out a way to distribute it fairly."

You have not yet given a rationale in my eyes that meets that standard. Diluting the currency in that way would damage the usability of the ethereum platform.  If the ethereum team wants to implement some kind of ""basic income"" scheme after serenity, completely decoupled from benefits to the platform (as suggested by your mention of ""gini coefficients"" [1]) I would use my (admittedly small) stake in the currency, and whatever miners I have running at that point (admittedly likely to be zero) to ""vote"" against any chain that implements such a feature.  (That said: I would NOT consider such an issuance a violation of the presale, given that you're only suggesting returning to an issuance model in line with the original plan... I just think it's a really bad idea)  [1] Issuance based on providing a service like connectivity/etc might be defendable, if there was a compelling plan put forward."

QNX is still a live and viable business, so they can retreat into that, and give up on BB OS and devices, and go pure embedded.  On the security front, they can certainly try to ride that BBM route cross-platform.    I don't think they have any real advantage left, though, other than some nostalgia and legacy ""preferred vendor"" remnants.    BBM has got no particular functional advantage over something like Telegram or any other of a raft of free secure messaging apps.   Companies like Silent Circle (https://home.silentcircle.com/) will kill Blackberry's remaining business in that enterprise zone, along with free solutions for the masses.  Ethereum is kryptonite to Blackberry.   All they really had was first-mover advantage and network effect amongst the IT enterprise community.   Both of those were lost years ago with BYOD.   Ethereum just moves things even further away from Blackberry's comfort zone.  Like Nokia, Blackberry are just a sad, shuffling zombie-company, I'm afraid.

Looks like QNX is really niche too, with only 5% of the embedded market as of a year ago.   Android had 17% and FreeRTOS had 17%.  Maybe we need to look at Ethereum implementation for FreeRTOS?   I guess a naive assumption that I (and probably others had) is that mobile OSes would be what go down into that IoT space which has been proprietary embedded an unconnected in the past.    For many scenarios, RTOS might be a requirement down in that space.    Linux or Android variants won't necessarily ""win"".   You will have RTOSes down there forever in some cases - it is just that those RTOSes are using WiFi, BLE and Zigbee too.  That's the kind of scenario where interoperability via IoTivity, AllJoyn, etc. becomes key.   Apple, Google and Samsung are pushing Homekit, Brillo and SAP (Samsung Application Protocol) as their closed-shop answers to those questions, but those are dreadful, constraining answers.    We need open standards.  Ethereum needs to get into that space too, so maybe somebody needs to a FreeRTOS port?  I think that will just another C++ port, just like I will need for wearable for Samsung Gear.   And it's probably another SPV mode application.    So maybe I'm doing it?  Ha ha!

I will also point out the idea of using ""call"" before doing an actual ""sendTransaction"": https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Useful-%C3%90app-Patterns  Following the call-then-sendTx pattern, our Dapp code would look like:  var callResult = gContract.reserveTicket.call(ticketId); if (callResult.toNumber() === ticketId) {   console.log('call GOOD so now do sendTransaction()...') } else {   // call failed, so we probably don't want to bother doing a sendTransaction()   return; }  // need to set up the watch before sendTransaction() var returnValueFilter = contractInstance.ticketEvent({ ticketId: ticketId }); returnValueFilter.watch(function(err, res) {   var eventArgs = res.args;   if (eventArgs.rval.toNumber() === ticketId) {     // success   }   else {     // fail   }    returnValueFilter.stopWatching(); });  contractInstance.reserveTicket.sendTransaction(ticketId, function(err, txHash) {   // check if err });   Hope this gives a good idea for now and we will document things further when we get time."

Nevertheless, I hope those 150k get bid up!"

In relation to a clause that ex-employees cant sell until a certain date, maybe the big V can clarify on this, but when I asked him it didn't seem like an issue. I also haven't sold anything yet since, like everyone else, I am not in possession of the ETH before frontier... so I really don't see the problem. :)"

Also, the trade will not take place before Frontier where it can be handled through escrow in a proper manner when the markets open. The purpose was only to see what interest there is, the post was deleted because there is enough interest.  Hope this answers your question :)"
ethereum,3atd8d,Mathias-g,4,Tue Jun 23 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"The other problem is the foundation is already planning to sell 3m ether, and who knows what all the devs going to do with their ether. That's a lot of sell pressure."
ethereum,3atd8d,MajorCavalcanti,2,Tue Jun 23 22:02:39 2015 UTC,In a normal market there is something like vesting. Things like this would be impossible in a regulated market.

I believe I read that when I was making the contribution but I don't see any violation. Perhaps you can tell me which part it violates? The document is pretty lengthy after all.   Clearly before a market even exists yet, insiders have more information to judge the value of the currency.   I will have to disagree here. The source code is out in the open and so does the roadmap and Olympic results. Ethdev are pretty open about the plan and the financial condition (a formal financial report sure would be nice though). I found that the Ethdev dispense information quite readily so I'm not really sure what advantage do they have over me.   Also, I've learned several founders have for-profit organizations on the side.   Well, Jeff Garzik works for Bitpay, Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille works for Blockstream, Peter Todd does various consulting works. It is actually pretty common in crypto world. If Ethdev started to display conflict of interest the community can easily fork it (see how Monero wins over Bytecoin for example)."
ethereum,3atd8d,Mathias-g,5,Tue Jun 23 11:35:47 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, i also don't see why 'For-profit' has a negative connotation attached to it. The main difference between the two is whether the entity pays dividends or doesn't, in the case of For-profit often founders/partners receive little to no money before the entity has actual success, which with startups is actually rarer than one might think.  In any case, the trade has not taken place yet, and will not take place before frontier (maybe even homestead depending on the contract rollback), so no terms have been violated."

Did they think they were going to compete with fiat?  I also see that in the ethereum community. A lot of folks here didn't buy presale and I think there is some resentment there. They'll say, this isn't about profit, it's about technology and improving the world(why not both?). They'll tell you to post on r/ethtrader, which is dead and they know it.

I see the difference. Which is why Ethereum has a higher expectation. Take a look at mempool janitor, 12s second block time, dynamic blocksize limit, 3 interoperable client. It took Bitcoin 6 years before they implement header-first sync. I don't care if you are only spending 6 hours a week on Ethereum, results is more important.   No. Bitcoin is their side project.   You see any of the Blockstream product that produces money? None. Because Blockstream really depends on Bitcoin all their devs need to improve on Bitcoin before they can make money. I think you are underestimating time spent by sipa on header-first and libsecp256k1. Take at a look at Greg's Element. Is that Blockstream code or Bitcoin code? I'd say that's Bitcoin because it is an alpha demonstration of sidechain and Blockstream is not making any money on it.   If everything was working super no one would complain but the fact is the organization is completely dysfunctional and unable to reach milestones.   That would depend on what you call milestones.

EDIT: Something that is not often mentioned is how much risk the people who joined Ethereum all the way from the beginning carried. Here is an outline of my own situation:  I learned about the project in November 2013, went back to Denmark more excited than I have ever been about a startup (As I am sure most of you were when you heard about the project) - I then closed my company and subsequently moved to Switzerland with the team in January. All the way until the end of the sale we didn't get any salary, and had the project failed we would have worked for 6+ months with nothing to show for it.   At the time a decision was made to reward early employees with Ether at the launch of the network (I was not a founder/board member so wasn't privy to the exact reasoning, but I think it was a fair decision everything considered).  The sale was postponed many times, but the team held together and lets be honest, in part because of the potential financial gains. But mostly because we didn't want to see months of hard work go to waste, we all believed, and still believe in the project and its potential to improve the lives of our fellow man."

ethereum,3areez,throwaway36256,2,Tue Jun 23 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"anthony334: in my opinion, it's more suitable to rethink the way difficulty adjustment was modelled and also to take into consideration the period time. The short period of time (~10 second) is very ad-hoc as the rational behind the difficulty adjustment . In bit-coin the difficulty was adjusted accordingly to a specific number of generated blocks. In Ethereum, the difficulty is adjusted in each block. There is no serious analysis why the local adjustment of the difficulty will perform better than the global adjustment as in bit-coin?"
ethereum,3areez,vbuterin,2,Tue Jun 23 06:29:29 2015 UTC,Difficulty adjustment for every block will make the system more responsive to change. Imagine if during the last 2 forks we have to wait for 2016 blocks before the difficulty change. With hashrate change with a factor of over 5-10 it will be nightmare.
ethereum,3areez,throwaway36256,2,Tue Jun 23 09:29:47 2015 UTC,"The other important reason is that I was very careful to make sure that all of the Ethereum protocol rules are efficiently light-client-verifiable, and averaging 2016 blocks relies on too much non-local information to effectively satisfy that property, whereas the current algorithm relies on the parent only."

The size and scope of human organizations—companies and governments—are largely a result of those transaction costs. Grocery stores, for instance, were invented because it was easier for customers than choosing individual vendors, and it was easier for farmers to sell in bulk to grocers than to individual customers.  Technology like Ethereum has the potential to reshape our society by directly connecting people together so they can interact without paying middlemen, and so they can coordinate groups in powerful ways that require the use of force today.

Also in the center, the first sentence under Point #4 (""Ethereum's vision is to decentralize the internet by creating a platform where applications can be built and run on a decentralized network."") seems to repeat itself. I say ""seems,"" because this may be due to my own lack of technical understanding. I can see a couple ways to make that sentence better. You might just leave it at ""Ethereum's vision is to decentralize the internet."" That's vague, but dramatic. But even if you keep most of the sentence as is, I don't think ""decentralized"" should be used twice in the same sentence.  At the bottom, under ""Ethereum Software Release Dates,"" the use of orange for the crowdfunding calls, I think, undue attention to the money (and thus to speculation) in a section that seems intended to focus on the actual software rollout (and thus utility). In general, I think the coloration, while consistent with Ethereum visual branding, makes it a little hard to read. I'm a traditionalist, but I think text, generally, is easier to read if it is a strong, dark color against a light background, rather than vice versa. In this case, both the blue background and the shaded text are a bit flat and provide insufficient contrast to make reading easy. Especially given that this is a bit text heavy (which is fine IMO, since there is so much to explain), efforts should be made to make the text as readable as possible."

If your not comfortable with this concept I strongly advise otherwise. This will be necessary until the network is live.   I have done quite a few trades and there is strong demand. Theres many traders who either missed the crowdsale or need liquidity. Most traded are the private keys and collateral will require verified I.D and verified social media accounts.  Strong buyers under 0.70c and sellers are sitting around the $1.00 - $1.50 USD. Quite a spread but there is movement."

ethereum,3ao55q,truqi,2,Tue Jun 23 02:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yes it would.  I think eth could get significantly above 10 tps (as in a few times more) through the basic built in ema block size scaling (the same stopgap sort of scaling solution bitcoin community is considering atm, except eth uses ema iirc).  This allows eth to scale a bit until it gets popular enough to need 2.0 scaling.    Re supporting a couple mainstream dapps, it can certainly do that imo.  Let's do a few napkin calculations:  1) let's assume a dapp like Augur does amazingly well prior to Eth 2.0 and gets a billion in 2016 in volume.  Divide by 365 to get average daily volume $2739726   2) Take that and divide by 24 (hours) then divide by 60 to get tpm then divide by 60 again to get tps.  3) take that and divide by 5 assuming an average $5 bet (probably a bit low, but I'm making this a ""worst case scenario"")  4) We get 6.34 transactions per second if people bet an average of $5 per bet and bet one billion dollars.

Currently the pre-market OTC price must price in the uncertainty surrounding Frontier development - they keep missing deadlines on their GitHub Milestones page, for example.   If Frontier launches in the next six weeks, there is every reason to think that the current OTC price range ($0.78 - $1.50) would be exceeded in early trading on the exchanges, given that it would dispel some uncertainties surrounding the viability of the project.  The price of Ethercoin, currently over $1, which is a highly risky asset, also suggests there is the potential for $1.50 or more to be achieved.   This already puts us in your 'Solid market interest' bracket."

Right or wrong a small company can't even afford the legal battle.  Cell phones: Verizon is an aweful company, anti-consumer, but no one can catch up to their network.

ethereum,3aleip,MacroMeez,3,Sun Jun 21 10:11:13 2015 UTC,We must go deeper! Write Ethereum interpreter as an Ethereum contract...
ethereum,3aleip,asenski,3,Sun Jun 21 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is a tougher problem than most realize. We are used to the backend of services constantly updating (to fix bugs and introduce new features), but doing that is a bit at odds with the decentralized app concept... although bugs and security issues will be found in contracts, and there needs to be a way to deal with this in a trust (or trustless) fashion.  When I asked this same question at a Dapp developer hangout we couldn't come up with a best solution either.  One idea was to point your Dapp at a new contract, but this is tough if you are storing things like balances (as you mention). Although I guess you could transfer balances at a certain time... although your old contract obviously still exists on the blockchain, making that interesting (and anyone can still access it directly if they wish).  Another option would be to create first a ""load balancing"" contract that you control that essentially redirects to another contract... so you can change that contract all you want. This is mimicking standard enterprise networking ""patterns"", but again it means people must trust you to not eventually redirect activity to a contract that no longer does what they expect (possibly stealing ether if you are running a market or something similar).  I think ""contract development patterns"", and anti-patterns, will get figured out as we go along, but currently I haven't seen any pattern outside existing SaaS development patterns being discussed, despite the clear differences."
ethereum,3aleip,thothrising,3,Mon Jun 22 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"Use a name registrar, so you can always redirect it to the new version.  Of course some people might prefer to keep using the old one by accessing it by its direct address."

ethereum,3aleip,natrius,2,Sun Jun 21 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"The best approach I've heard of so far is to have a contract that exposes direct access to its storage and whitelists the contracts that can call it. Several methods can be used to control whitelist changes, from blessed admin accounts with write access to democracy that lets a set of stakeholders vote on changes to the whitelist. You'd probably want to separate the whitelist mechanism into a separate contract that could be changed as well, so you could start with admins for simplicity, but move to more resilient methods later.

This allows the creator to cripple/deactivate the contract so no one can call it anymore. Probably not the cleanest method but I think one that can be done without any changes to ethereum... and we better hope that a bug doesn't keep that toggle function from working right!"

Why would the reputation system be hard problem? It seems very straightforward to implement a comprehensive replacement with cryptography/smart contracts.  Third-party authorities could, for a nominal fee (or % of revenues), vouch for specific drivers (to guarantee they have passed background checks and are suitable according to the same kind of screening criteria used by Uber), insure their vehicle (we could even think of a ""pay per drive"" model), act as an arbiter in case of dispute.  Passengers and drivers who have ridden a minimum distance together could rate each other and get a small rebate as an incentive to keep the rating system reliable and healthy. As part of the GUI, it would be possible to filter drivers/passengers according to objective criteria (certifications, insurance, distance driven, currency deposit amount, ratings, known contacts...) and prevent abuse as efficiently as centralize services do."

If things hold up, I imagine a launch would be due shortly after that.  The part that makes the timeframe almost impossible to predict though is, will the current set of bugs be the last major set?  Or will we find more next time we throw a barrage of stress tests at the network?   Is there the potential for running out of capital before launch?   Based on Vitalik's comments and numbers on funding here and the worst case launch estimates (Aug. 1 according to fairlay, a prediction market) it seems extremely unlikely."
ethereum,3ad6pk,joeykrug,4,Fri Jun 19 04:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced about the funding issue. It seems pretty much undecided from what I read.

ethereum,3ad6pk,chem_deth,4,Fri Jun 19 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"I guess the thing regarding the funding issue from my perspective is, if they end up taking so long to launch that it uses up all their remaining runway (6-8mo. depending on who you ask) I don't think Eth is gonna come out anyway, e.g. it's a lost cause.    Obviously I don't think that since I'm staking Augur on Ethereum :)"

Agreed. They can launch Frontier next year for all I care. I'm not that interested in the launch date per se. What bothers/scares me is the burn rate. They don't have enough money to delay the launch that long!  To me, at least, it's all about how long their funding will last. The longer it takes to launch Frontier, the less money they have remaining to ""finish"" the project (e.g. get to Metropolis)."
ethereum,3ad6pk,ddink7,2,Fri Jun 19 12:53:27 2015 UTC,Thank you for the explanation.  I thought we got the 'two weeks' nod over a month ago... from your comment it seems we have a while to go.  What happened that changed that timeframe so drastically? Was it one incident?
ethereum,3ad6pk,joeykrug,8,Fri Jun 19 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remember that nod as well.  I don't think it was anything in particular, mainly that there's just been a few forks due to various things that have been picked up in testing (simple issues from a programming perspective, e.g. forgetting to check certain things regarding block nonces, etc.) but that just weren't really noticed until people started hammering the network.  On the bright side, according to Vitalik we're really testing the last main thing at the moment (which is, what happens when you spam the network with a ton of transactions).    Just speculating here, but I suspect the team realized something along the lines of ""perhaps it's best if we wait a few weeks and get these kinks worked out before doing Frontier launch, better to ruffle a few feathers by some delays now than to launch early and have forks and propagation issues.""  Although it is a bit frustrating, in my opinion they made the right decision and I would've made the same one in this case."

ethereum,3ad6pk,vbuterin,22,Sun Jun 21 08:06:29 2015 UTC,"This is a personal statement: in the imho very unlikely event that we run out of cash before launch, I will continue anyway, most likely not alone. And if we all starve to incapacity and you dont care, then we all deserved it and its all cool.  In fact if at any point the project goes out of funding it will signal that there is no demand for it. And it will only matter for post mortem analysis whether it was failed expectations, mounting distrust or buggy product. If it does not happen it means it was perceived not worthy. That really is that simple.  All I can say the individual contributors build credit via their github commits we stake this reputational credit as colleteral for your support. In my subjective valuation the aggregate reputational credit of ethdev is worth significantly more than the crowdsale so you are safe at least knowing that the organisation is incentivised to keep its face even with the constraint that  there is zero further benefit expected from delivering.   To answer your question imho the delay was due partly to youthful hubris when evaluating the journey from 3 almost completely functional good and interoperating ethereum implementations a year ago until a super-mega-stable audited secure efficient scalable theoretically ~100% sound live network with complete useable apis and interfaces, supporting essential infrastructure (compiler integration, gpu miner, network health monitoring and  stats), efficient and resilient p2p network layer, and base layer services for storage and messaging, etc etc. [for the rhetorical effect I am coompletely misrepresenting our milestones, here but you got the idea :)]  It was (is) also a moving target, partly because we encountered genuinely unexpected challenges (we might be a young team, but i hope you agree the matter at hand is novel to say the least. I feel it's legit we hit upon stuff totally unbudgeted for on top of budgeting for unknown risk.) And partly because the foundations are insanely seminal. One awesome idea, extension, comes after the other inside and outside ethdev leading to a fluid everimproving featureset and more rigorous spec. Ethereum go is the most responsive dev team I have seen let alone been part of). The word agile is an understatement verging an insult.  Our coding frenzy results in consistently improving software and brings us a step closer to the vision. So no drama all I'm saying.   Here's the deal have look at a GH issue, if you think some of it is not important and instead of fixing it we should release, come on in our gitter room and speak or leave a comment (well convince /u/jeffehhh, good luck with that you gotta be at your wits, but it is positively possible :). [Note this is not invitation for trolling, just testimony to responsiveness].   projected timeline? i heard two weeks maybe ;)))))"

The question is, why not prevent the ""if need be"" situation by paying lower salaries right now? Considering salaries are 90% of expenses, big savings could be made, and the money invested elsewhere (how much money are you spending on marketing, for instance?).  Nobody said it's easy to manage funds and people, but there has to be a more sustainable ground between near $200K salaries and zero salaries.  PS: I haven't bought ether, so I technically don't have a personal interest in lower salaries or even the success of Ethereum in particular. My bet is on smart contracts, DAOs, turing complete transactions, etc. Not the particular implementation thereof."

These guys are building something which has the potential scope of impact of the Internet and you are bitching that they MAY run out of money based on second-hand information?

It's a massive undertaking, and huge strides are being made.   Just watch the open development channels and you will see constant progress.  Nobody is sitting on their laurels.   Even if the money does ""run out"" then so what?   Development won't cease.   Linux wasn't funded.   Most open source is never funded.   It still succeeds.    The funding for Ethereum accelerates the development.  Development won't cease if the money runs out.  Look at every startup in the world.

I'm also worried about running out of funds and I think the salaries the founders are taking are outrageous, 150k-200k. I believe the only founder to ever make that kind of salary prior to ethereum is Joseph Lubin, who is not really involved with the development and is running two additional projects.

ethereum,3ahlht,Rune4444,3,Sat Jun 20 07:15:02 2015 UTC,"Actually it's trivial for anyone who understands multisig to do a double bonded escrow buy, which is just as safe as buying ether at launch as long as you set the bonds correctly. People who aren't able to comfortably do bitcoin escrow transactions would be wise not to touch ether during frontier either, IMO. If you want to be completely safe you should wait until a trusted exchange starts trading it.  The OP of this thread could also be legit, if he is actually someone with a strong rating in a reliable trust network (no clue if supernet is this or not)"

ethereum,3ahlht,inviolinable,2,Sat Jun 20 11:50:16 2015 UTC,"I have tried to work out what SuperNet is a number of times, but all I can find is marketing-speak and sales pitches.  Here is my question in its essence: How is SuperNet different from a database on someone's computer somewhere?  Put another way, if I give something 'to' SuperNet, who am I trusting to secure, exchange, or return it?  With Bitcoin, I know that I am trusting a network of miners operating according to a rigoursly tested protocol and with a particular track record. With Ethereum, I am currently trusting a non-profit and soon a blockchain network.  What evidence is there that SuperNet is either trustworthy or trustless or 'trust-minimising'?"
ethereum,3ahlht,dnydublin12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:43:45 2015 UTC,"I know he's quite an enigma. Jl777 is a highly respected NXT developer. Just go to NXTforum.org and read his post history to see what he's doing and what kind of guy he is. https://nxtforum.org/index.php?action=recent   Good time to plug the sub I just designed for supernet.   http://www.reddit.com/r/supernet/  Some relevant info on that sub regarding supernet   Supernet is a superwallet built on top of nxt. You can actually download it and use it right now. It's functional but not totally realized.   In supernet, you will be able to buy and trade all types of coins and assets WITHIN THE CLIENT, through the services he's built, namely Instantdex(a decentralized exchange) and Mutligateway(Trading coins by proxy using the NXT asset exchange)   In the near future, Supernet will also be connected to fiat services, so that literally you can do all your cryposhopping in one secured wallet.   sorry, I'm ranting, I am a fanboy ;)  The important thing to note is that Jl777 has delivered thus far. MGW works great and the Supernet client is almost complete. Another thing to note is that Jl777 has a relatively large stake in the NXT platform. He represents it. He wants it, and the NXT platform to succeed, so he will never defraud you, he's never defrauded anybody. He's the overseer of asset dividends and large accounts and he's delivered on all his responsibilities.   Regarding this specific deal. Some members of supernet slack vented their frustrations with Ethereum's delay, some of us want to sell and move on to other projects. So Jl777 kindly set this up. He took an inventory of ether held by us. Created an asset called Superether in the NXT exchange and sent it to us. It represents 1 for 1 of our ether holdings(Superether is ether by proxy)   So he's basically entrusting us to have the amount of Ether we state.(this is a limited sale by trusted members) He's fronting a buyers insurance, just in case something goes wrong. So you are protected up to 10 btc.   When you buy the superether on the NXT exchange, you hold it in your NXT wallet as an Asset. When frontier goes live, we will send our Ether to an Ether account held by supernet so that you can redeem it through Multigateway.(MGW)   That was the longest comment I've made on reddit lol. Just one more thing, Superether is being traded now. Sell orders, buy orders are set up"

The whole point of cryptocurrencies is financial systems without trusted third parties. However 'kindly' or 'hardworking' this developer is it still defeats the purpose entirely to trust them with value.  I understand the service that SuperNet is intended to provide. I also understand the merits of such a service. What I want to understand is Who is being trusted? Upon whom does the operation of the system rest? What machines record and process transactions and how do they interoperate?  In the absence of an open-source, secure, bitcoin-like network, traditional accountability is a minimum for any level of trustworthiness. No matter what 'kind of guy' an unnamed developer is.  Literally, the only thing I know about the underlying network of SuperNet is that the person who named it believed it to be Super.  I don't mean to be disparaging. I genuinely would like to understand, but I do find the sales-speak and absence of solid information concerning."

ethereum,3adkto,DonaldMcIntyre,6,Fri Jun 19 06:31:40 2015 UTC,"Hey Donald,  I have a few criticisms when looking at your pitch deck. I am by far not an expert in pitching, but I thought I'd share my ideas so maybe you can think through them and decide if something's of value to you.  First up: always start with the problem, never the product. The first goal of a presentation is to connect with the audience. By starting with the problem people can ""feel"" the issue, then they are much more open/curious as to how you would solve it.  Your deck contains waaay to much technical details (SIP, DAO, AI), and in general waaay to much data and slides. A startup pitch usually lasts 3/5/10 minutes the most, so you cannot afford to go into so many details.  On a similar note, your slides are very very full of text and information. This will lead to people reading your slide and not paying attention to you. The deck's goal is to get your point across, not a source of information, use graphics and keywords at most. You should have a one pager or a short portfolio that you can give out to interested parties with the details. The pitch is for investors to get interested, then you need the details for keep them interested afterwards.  Looking at the competition chart it's kind of looking that you're changing the world (typical top right positioning vs. everyone else bottom (left)). I am not familiar with this industry segment, but it would seem odd that nobody had a similar idea. On the other had if someone had, and you didn't include it, and they catch you with it... game over :P  Going towards nitpicking, make it more stylish :) It makes for a much better first impression.  All in all however, it's really cool :) Go go go, make the world a better place :D  Btw, by far my two favorite pitch decks:   Airbnb: http://www.slideshare.net/benjaminevans/air-bed-breakfast-pitch-deck-18014008   Buffer: http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-seedrounddeck"

I understand the problem you're trying to solve, understand the underlying technology and I'm looking forward to have all my finances be managed by smart contracts on the blockchain.  But I still don't understand what is your product or what is your solution. Are you going to write a bunch of ethereum Ðapps that automatically buy and sell ethereal sub-currencies? Are you going to write scripts that trade cryptocurrencies based on some crazy smart algorithm? Are you going to have a network of brokers that go in ethereum and make a reputation so that other people can follow them? Or are you just selling the concept and you will develop the final product once you get funding?"

Yes, the 3 articles and the pitch deck are to present the vision and concept and use that to request seed funding to build a team and the prototype.  I am a non-technical entrepreneur so I can't build examples and test them. What you see are conceptual ideations of a smart investment plan business.

In real life they are retirement plans, college funds, trust funds, annuities, pension funds, and targeted savings plans.   Yes, but how are they supposed to work? I'd love to start doing a 30 year long term investment plan on ethereum assets, but you can't magically hand wave what that means. E.g: I want my 30 year investment to be low risk but guaranteed yeld, I want a fund that I will promise not to touch for 5 years but I want a good interest on it, I want 10% of my earnings to go to high risk high reward investments. It seems rather straightforward but you can't simply program this into ethereum. What is a ""low risk"" asset in ethereum? Even the many stable-coin proposals are in their infancy and can crash. You can program a smart contract to invest in a high risk DAO share right now, but if it's successful it will become a boring bond in 5 years, how do you take that into account?  I can think of dozens of solutions: maybe you have a proprietary algo that will do all this smartly, maybe you are planning on having a marketplace for human traders, maybe you just want to keep track of investment reputation in contracts. You don't need to give away your secret sauce, but I really feel you should at least explain what kind of meal you are serving.  Anyway, I look forward to see more of that. The reason I'm criticising you heavily is because I really want this to be a real product one day: if you decide not to go with VC capital and instead do some sort of crowdsale DAO in ethereum in the future I might be even interested in participating.."

I want to clarify that the savings and investment processes are traditional and exist in real life.

ethereum,3a9ehk,martinBrown1984,5,Thu Jun 18 10:00:36 2015 UTC,"Actually I personally think the initial figure of 20tps supported by Ethereum is also extremely suspect.   First of all from stats.ethdev more than 50% of the blocks took more than 10s to propagate. (Please correct me if I interpret this part wrong)This means that assuming the node distribution registered stats.ethdev represents mining node more than 50% of the time some of the miner is not working on the current block, mining stales (uncles) instead of the main chain. This is a waste. Especially since uncle cannot have descendant.  Which brings us to the 2nd part. How many (0-conf,1-conf,2-conf) transactions are actually being dropped? Because starting 0.9.30 we started to implement some form of mempool janitor, some of the 0-conf is not going to propagate. And because some of the miner is not mining on the main chain there surely some of the block declared invalid because it is not in the main chain (2nd gen uncles/cousins). If anyone has any hard figure on the last experiment I would be very grateful if they could share it."
ethereum,3a9ehk,throwaway36256,6,Thu Jun 18 12:33:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is all correct. The gas limit we picked ended up very closely matching the level at which the chain starts to hit the stale and centralization barriers. The next thing we'll do to substantially alleviate this is have all clients re-broadcast blocks after only checking the PoW, and not evaluating everything, though latest word from Jeff is that that will take a bit of re-architecting on the go side; if we do that then the difference in propagation time between a 3m gas block and an empty block should be cut down by a factor of log(size of network)."

ethereum,3a9ehk,RaptorXP,2,Sat Jun 20 11:24:52 2015 UTC,"I understand how great it is to decentralize apps.  If every part of an app could be decentralized on the blockchain that would be fantastic.  But it does come at a cost.  As a layman I call this ""the cost to publish"".  Publishing is not free however its cost can be relatively low so long as the volume of transactions remain within the limitations of the architecture of the network.  With bitcoin you have 1mb block sizes.  With Ethereum we are up against 12 sec block times and network propagation technical hurdles.  Every network has its limitations.  Up to the point of that limitation publishing is of a reasonable cost (again I am not a scalability expert) then once you hit that limitation transactions get prohibitively more expensive for everyone simultaneously.  Either this cost manifests itself as a fee to discourage excessive publishing or it would be a cost placed on all users who would experience greater difficulty in getting their transactions published into a block and getting that block propagated across the network.  If you are not a layman and instead you are a blockchain architect then you come up with unique solutions to scalability.  If you can follow Vitalik's work on this subject https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/09/17/scalability-part-1-building-top/ that is great.  Most of are limited in our grasp of scalability.  For app developers the most obvious solution is less publishing to create greater ease and convenience for users and a better user experience.  Transactions that take place between coinbase or circle users are faster and easier than transactions that are published on the blockchain.  There is a security risk in trusting a 3rd party but most Ethereum app developers need to have a fair amount of code on a backend server somewhere for their apps to run correctly.  Few apps are simple enough that all of their code is stored on the blockchain itself.  So again this topic is not simple and it has many solutions.  I wouldn't worry about it because there will always be trade offs and balances between decentralized and centralized module architecture of an app running on the Ethereum network.  You might be willing to trust 10 to 20 dollars to a centralized module within a mostly decentralized app if it would mean a better user experience for you.  This module may not publish all of the transactions between all of the users on the blockchain but it may not matter if it allows you to get a ride to the airport conveniently without too much hassle and it does this reliably for several months for several thousand users then what do you care?  If your 10 or 20 dollars is lost because the app lost or stole those funds the utility of centralization was relative to the financial risk that you took.  Anyways 20 people will tell me that I am wrong but from my perspective you simply need to find the right balance between the amount of funds you are entrusting to a service and the level of decentralization in the management of those funds.  People trust changetip with their funds and correct me if I am wrong but it is a mostly centralized service.  For any funds over 100 USD I would expect every transaction to be published.  For any funds under 100 USD I expect there to be a sliding scale in terms of centralization of funds management for certain modules of the app architecture.  Think about it."

ethereum,3a9ehk,TrustlessPrivacy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"The advances come at the end... bare with me :)  Ethereum, in my opinion, and indeed all distributed ledger solutions, are not really going to be able to compete on performance and latency with centralized solutions.  A few examples from different institution types:  Visa - average of 4-6k tps and peak rates around 10-15k  Mastercard - average of 2-4k tps and peak rates around 5-7k  NYSE - 1M+ tps and peak rates of 2-3M  (There is also a difference between messages per second and transactions per second, and in the case of VISA, Mastercard and multilateral trading facilities like NYSE - settlements per second.)  The point being, distributed ledger technology is great for certain things, but not necessarily for others. Serialization of events for example is easier to do with centralized solutions, and where performance is important, close to impossible to attain with distributed ledgers. - At least without opening the system up to race condition issues and potentially double spending.  When this is said though, the big optimizations this technology will bring to finance include but is not limited to things like: Asynchronous settlement and clearing, transfer of value between unrelated entities, transparency through auditing solutions... These things will bring massive value to the finance industry and in a significant way change the way institutions do business on an every day basis.  Also, remember that transactions per second do not necessarily equal the amount of transaction you can output, with most distributed ledgers one transaction can have many outputs."
ethereum,3a9ehk,Mathias-g,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"Distributed networks probably can't scale in a comparable fashion to centralized solutions. Decentralized solutions are much more scalable. Bitshares can process 180,000 tps with 2 second block times on consumer hardware using delegate proof of stake consensus and the architecture behind lmax exchange which can process 6 million tps with <1ms latency. These systems can scale they just have to ne designed correctly and pow is not scalable or econimcally efficient."
ethereum,3a9ehk,malcolmjmr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:56:35 2015 UTC,Exactly the point I am trying to make. Some applications need low latency. More distribution = higher latency... which means things like multilateral exchange on a distributed ledger is inconvenient and creates inefficient pricing :)

We will work with you and the community to create add any new functionality required for our Internet of things use case back in to the base where that makes sense.

ethereum,3a9ebn,dnydublin12,2,Thu Jun 18 10:03:02 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on whether they want to use their own private chains with up to date core protocol (which would mean they have none of the benefits of the open ledger/cryptoeconomic security provided by the main chain) or not.

If this is the case, it implies that they intend to use their own chains. That doesn't mean they will not be open, may well be. But sounds like a different chain and network I think.  When you think about it, it makes sense. Why would a company like IBM with all its computing resources pay (in the form of ether) to use someone elses computers (in the form of mining)?

ethereum,3a5xeh,aedigix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:22:14 2015 UTC,You also have to consider that all Visa/MC/Amex/JCB transactions are not fully settled for at least 120+ days as they can be rolled back (chargebacks).    To the customer and the credit card fraudster this is not an issue but for the merchant this is a risk that they always have to consider.   In any case Ethereum isn't really designed to compete within this specific use case.  It's designed so that this specific use case ultimately become a non-issue.     Take my mobile phone for example.  When it is due for me to pay my bill I would either have to log into my online account to authorize a payment or to pre-authorize monthly payments which allows my mobile provider to charge the payment method that I am required to give them while trusting that they keep this information safe.  What if I can just execute a contract that automatically pays for my usage while giving me much better buyer protection that's built into the contract itself.

ethereum,3a5xeh,Onetallnerd,3,Wed Jun 17 15:57:58 2015 UTC,It should be by no means easy to hardfork. That's the wrong way to look at it. I can imagine in four years time changing and forking ethereum will be just as hard unless it has full consensus.
ethereum,3a5xeh,BlockDigest,3,Wed Jun 17 16:56:12 2015 UTC,I noticed that blocks with that many transactions take about 3s to be processed. Do you think that this could impact miners in a negative way since block time is 12s?
ethereum,3a5xeh,Onetallnerd,3,Wed Jun 17 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, a lot. People don't seem to realize it, but the reason bitcoin devs don't just increase the block size is the effects propagation time would have on miners. The effects need to be tested and show that it doesn't negatively impact the network too much. This is with ten minutes, imagine how much worse it is when blocks in ethereum are as short as they are. Currently the reward is low mining here, once the real network is started you won't see many miners mining that many transactions in the fear that some other miner with less transactions mines a block that propagates faster."
ethereum,3a5xeh,BlockDigest,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"People don't seem to realize it, but the reason bitcoin devs don't just increase the block size is the effects propagation time would have on miners.   Exactly, initially in bitcoin the thought was to remove the block size limit completely but it became apparent that potential attacks could be executed as someone could send blocks that would take too much time to validate, while the attacker is already working on the next block. Same thing here, although not an attack per se, it can be argued that as transaction volume increases, miners would need faster CPUs in order to stay in the game."
ethereum,3a5xeh,drcode,4,Wed Jun 17 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind if you mine on the ""wrong"" block in ethereum you'll still get rewarded (uncle blocks) so this is less of an issue."
ethereum,3a5xeh,BlockDigest,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yes true, but the matter is when you mine the uncle of the previous block you get nothing. I think stale blocks are also rewarded but if a miner is at a point where they only mine stale blocks, mining becomes inefficient."
ethereum,3a5xeh,Onetallnerd,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:49:32 2015 UTC,It's still all about incentives. I'm assuming uncle blocks get rewarded less than the main blocks correct? If so there's still more of an incentive to get the first block out with less transactions that minimizes propagation time. Why would I be charitable and include more transactions and risk not getting the main reward? Ideally how high would the fees need to get for me to be incentivized include more? These are all questions you need to ask yourself and test. It's all about incentives.

ethereum,3a5xeh,avsa,11,Wed Jun 17 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"Today the network is being heavily ""ddosed"" meaning that there are a lot of transactions being shot at. We have dynamic prices of gas now and the blocks are reaching the gas limit so it's a great stress test. Taylor is showing a screenshot of a 12 second block that was carrying 207 transactions, meaning that the network was handling an average of 17 transactions per second.  He is mentioning a debate going on in bitcoin currently about increasing the block size of btw that will allow them to go over the limit of about 7 transactions per second that the bitcoin has. I don't think it's a direct comparison, but it's a nice benchmark."

ethereum,3a7o3q,Ursium,2,Tue Jun 23 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that deleting data gives your transaction an extra ""power boost"": It gives you some extra gas for running additional opcodes (I forget the details, but they're in the whitepaper.)  So in theory, if you consistently delete old data, your users benefit from lower overall gas requirements."
ethereum,3a7o3q,drcode,3,Wed Jun 17 23:59:48 2015 UTC,Correct. Deleting data gives you a net refund of 10000 gas.  This is the doc with the gas costs: https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit#gid=0
ethereum,3a7o3q,vbuterin,2,Thu Jun 18 02:47:00 2015 UTC,but you can only safe money if you can combine the deletion with another tx you would have done anyway. Creating a tx just to delete data will only cost you since the refund can only be used for part of the tx costs. (correct me if I am wrong)
ethereum,3a7o3q,TeamFairlay,2,Thu Jun 18 09:10:28 2015 UTC,Correct. I expect that the contract itself will find some clever way to combining deletion with other transactions that involve heavy computation.

ethereum,3a7g66,avsa,2,Wed Jun 17 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"If my aim was to create a perpetually live or active contract, could I have 2 contracts alternately prompt each other at intervals? For example, if message from Contract A, wait Time X, then message to Contract A.   Or can a contract be programmed to wait for Block K, then do Task Y, then wait for Block K + 1, etc.  The practical use case I'm considering is a very small data store of performance metrics sent from easy to hack/manipulate devices. It would be nice to have the contract check its data store at intervals for rapid changes in its metrics which would indicate malfeasance."
ethereum,3a7g66,inviolinable,3,Thu Jun 18 00:41:51 2015 UTC,You could set your contract to pay the miner to run it at a certain block as an incentive.  One thing you'll have to ensure that the contract has enough funds to pay for gas in the future.  This is where CFDs for GAS would come into play.
ethereum,3a7g66,aedigix,2,Thu Jun 18 04:50:49 2015 UTC,Would this require an out-of-chain relationship with the miner or could it be entirely formalised in the contract?

ethereum,3a7g66,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,2,Thu Jun 18 12:26:55 2015 UTC,This is done all within the contract.  Eventually there would be a gas CFD DAO that the contract would interface with to ensure that the contract will run with enough gas once it is time to do so.

Some contract that has a positive balance, could send back funds to it (which is tx.origin as opposed to msg.sender), but the initial transaction has to provide enough gas for that execution to happen (otherwise Out of Gas exception).  In an example when some contract sends funds back to tx.origin, it is like tx.origin might pay 10, get 3 back from a contract, and effectively spent only 7: but it may have had to pay 10 initially to avoid Out of Gas.

That being said, I am under the impression that a fair number of people would be willing to pay for certain content if it was available in their location by other means, but as it is, are only able to torrent it? This is not the case for me, and I am not 100% certain about the ethics of that in all cases, but that seems then that if their doing so is ethical, that a system with which they could incentivize the seeding of the content they want could be a good thing?  Further, I am under the impression that a large part of the content which is available through torrents is in some sense ""abandoned"", such that either it is not known who the rights holders are, or the rights holder no longer intends to sell access to the content. In these cases where there is no legal method to gain copies of the content, while I personally have not done this, I think it is likely  ethical to download and share theses ""abandoned"" works in many cases (though I am not certain, or certain of which cases, which is probably part of why I haven't).  And then, I'm not sure that the most common use of a thing being of questionable ethics necessarily means that one should not promote the thing being more usable? Sometimes the misuse of something is a consequence one must accept, in order to guarantee the option to use the thing correctly in the future?  so, tl;dr: I have never torrented anything illegal, and I think I generally support this development."

For block transmission, they plan to transmit a small fixed-size data structure that lets miners reconstruct the full block from the transactions they already have. This removes a severe limit on tx/sec that's due to block transmission time, which is proportional to block size. They think they can scale to VISA levels that way, even on home broadband connections.  Blockchain size is still an issue, which they'll tackle by pruning old empty addresses.

The IBLT stuff is hand waving for the moment, it's predecessor known as the high speed block relay has already been in use for years and is extremely stable. It has the same core concept, but a significantly simpler execution. No matter which you use there is still fundamental limits on the bandwidth of most nodes, and in some cases the use of IBLT can actually cause more centralization by amplifying the hash power of large miners.    They think they can scale to VISA levels that way, even on home broadband connections.   Nobody technical really thinks that. Bitcoin can not scale to that level, it's pretty on the edge as it is in the current state with a small number of transactions in comparison. There's room for improvement but there's other problems than getting blocks around. If you use ""visa level"" as your measure for insanity, you quickly reach the point where no single CPU can verify that many ECDSA signatures a second to keep up with the network.     Blockchain size is still an issue, which they'll tackle by pruning old empty addresses. I don't know how much effect that'll have.

He didn't address CPU, but according to the wiki page on scalability, 4000 tx/sec is easily achievable with a mainstream CPU, and with more aggressive optimization, up to 20K tx/sec, or a lot more if they do a hard fork to a different signature algorithm.

I'd like to share some of my key learnings with you in hopes that your project is more successful than mine.  1)  Scope control is everything.   My client wanted to do everything out of the gate.   Start small, stay focused.    2) Beware of the technology risks.   We were using new technology and there were lots of time consuming delays to get it working properly.  We based key decisions on vendor promises - make sure the technology is not vaporware.  3) Make sure your funding is solid and the backer has a high risk tolerance.  Our VC ultimately pulled out and caused the project to fail.     4) Rapid prototyping is your friend.  At the time, doing detailed requirements was a best practice.   We spent way too much time pushing paper.   Get prototypes out and in front of your stakeholders for feedback.  5)  Have a plan B.     Just some thoughts, hope they help."

ethereum,39xrd8,jeffehhh,11,Mon Jun 15 17:40:25 2015 UTC,Approximately about how many release are due to step it up into Frontier.  In your opinion. Thanks-Keep up the awesome work.
ethereum,39xrd8,JoeOak,6,Mon Jun 15 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"As many as it takes. It might seem painful now, but it will be many times more painful when real money is on the line."
ethereum,39xrd8,worldcoinninja,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"No, it's not painful to me.  If it takes another year, I'm cool.  Just thought he could give a round about number, even though many more could be added at anytime."
ethereum,39xrd8,JoeOak,3,Tue Jun 16 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"they're trying to give less projections.  also, given the funding, it's definitely not cool if it takes another year."
ethereum,39xrd8,lozj,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"same for me. Long time is fine, but a realistic estimate would be nice. My current best guess is October/November."
ethereum,39xrd8,sockpupet,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:00:39 2015 UTC,that's 6 months from now. I believe they will be out of funding by then.
ethereum,39xrd8,sockpupet,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:55:39 2015 UTC,I am sure there is enough excitement about ethereum that it will continue anyway. Remember: people where and are still build stuff for ethereum where no money is involved.
ethereum,39xrd8,CanaryInTheMine,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"this is insane. if people build for free, why are we paying 500k a month on salaries?"
ethereum,39xrd8,LefterisJP,4,Wed Jun 17 20:12:46 2015 UTC,the sooner nodes upgrade the faster the network can heal itself... please update to ver .30 or higher
ethereum,39xrd8,decypha,3,Mon Jun 15 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"And its name is ""consolation"" :))"
ethereum,39xrd8,joeykrug,3,Mon Jun 15 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"yes we also started a naming scheme mostly for our own enjoyment. Please do not attribute too much significance to these, they are certianly not related or comparable to names given to the major product stages on the roadmap: oplympic, frontier, homestead, metropolis and serenity  for the record: consolation"
ethereum,39xrd8,Litecoin_Messiah,3,Mon Jun 15 23:16:54 2015 UTC,Block propagation still really low (10%) even after quite a few of the netstats nodes updated to new version.  Testing https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/39vgzr/next_olympic_reward_large_number_of_transactions/ was a good call by vbuterins
ethereum,39xrd8,joeykrug,2,Mon Jun 15 22:57:53 2015 UTC,Do we have to re download the blockchain?
ethereum,39xrd8,biglambda,2,Mon Jun 15 21:05:29 2015 UTC,nope
ethereum,39xrd8,throwaway36256,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:53 2015 UTC,One question regarding geth: If we are pulling from git should we continue to pull from the develop branch? Is every commit on that branch (in theory) a good client to use?
ethereum,39xrd8,decypha,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:59:35 2015 UTC,I believe 0.9.30 mentioned by Jeff comes from master branch.
ethereum,39xrd8,dnydublin12,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"we started an even-odd scheme. Releases ending in odd are only on develop (line 0.9.29 was), to be consolidated even-ending versions (like 0.9.30).   If you want the bleeding edge, then yes, please use develop.  However, for those not willing to compile every 3 seconds that we update :), the new scheme provides reliable updates on the master branch."
ethereum,39xrd8,mezozoy,0,Mon Jun 15 23:09:54 2015 UTC,I'm delighted you are doing this now. Releasing from development branch was lunacy.
ethereum,39zt9u,sockpupet,4,Tue Jun 16 02:58:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip. If anyone else disagrees with the probabilities they have expected value to collect :)
ethereum,39zt9u,heltok,3,Tue Jun 16 19:40:03 2015 UTC,Not even the devs know. Ethereum could go live this week. Next month or Christmas. It's mostly a matter of bugs. I wouldn't give fairlay too much credence
ethereum,39zt9u,luvasugirls,4,Tue Jun 16 03:05:36 2015 UTC,but I would at least be interested if the devs had to place money on it what they would do. By the way - if someone places 4.5BTC Bitcoin against a start before August it might me more than just a pure guess. By the way - I am fine with it if it takes until Xmas but I would like to hear a realistic forecast.
ethereum,39zt9u,robmyers,-3,Tue Jun 16 03:30:48 2015 UTC,I'd be more interested if they slaughtered a goat. It would have a better chance of telling the future than cargo cult behavioural economics would.  The reaslistic forecast hasn't changed - it's when the bugs are fixed.  Deal with it.
ethereum,39zt9u,Ursium,-9,Tue Jun 16 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Obvious ad is obvious, but at least you're honest with your username, /u/sockpupet , with a whole 3 post to your name.  Downvoted for now but in the future we're going to have rules similar http://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/1404/forum-rules-read-before-posting. Consider the next couple weeks a 'socialization' period :)"
ethereum,39zt9u,asenski,7,Tue Jun 16 07:20:14 2015 UTC,at least 10% of the posts in this sub has been about prediction markets. So now I am posting a image showing odds of a prediction market on a topic everyone in this sub is interested in. Seems to me like a legit post. And I am pretty sure if the odds had been more in favor of a soon release it had been up voted a lot and you would not have been blaming me.
ethereum,39zt9u,truqi,9,Tue Jun 16 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"How is that an ad?  Get off your high horse.  I find this is relevant and it should spawn a meaningful discussion, not an attack. I agree the new user and his funky nickname may be suspect, but that's no way to welcome people to a community.  And those guidelines... who is the judge of that? You, or the community? Just because this links to a site, which may have commercial offering itself, doesn't mean the material is not relevant. In fact I just checked it doesn't even link to a site, it's a screenshot.  What a convenient way to dodge answering the questions raised here."
ethereum,39zt9u,sakp0pet,5,Tue Jun 16 08:53:28 2015 UTC,agree
ethereum,39zt9u,etherminer24,5,Tue Jun 16 10:35:36 2015 UTC,agree. /u/xcthulhu said stuff I've been thinking ever since the exodus address got zeroed. The questions should be answered - with an audit.
ethereum,39xakt,noheaven12,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:39:31 2015 UTC,I suggest you give a try at embark.
ethereum,39xakt,heliumcraft,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, you have the following options, all a bit awkward right now (since Mist is not ready)   You can tell people to install their own node, then visit regular web page you've set up, and the javascript in the browser will connect to a local port to the user's node. This works right now, but isn't very user friendly, because of the setup complexity. You can install an ethereum node on the webserver, then make the webserver talk directly to the chain (I'm hacking together something like this right now) As you suggest, you could put an ethereum node up on the internet somewhere and just have the client javascript connect to it... this is probably not a good idea though, since ""geth"" isn't really designed as a multiuser app (in fact, I don't really know if it would allow for secure account unlocking that is limited to a single client, so this may not be workable, even in principle) You can wait for mist Rumors are, there's a server-side library in the works for web-based ethereum apps called ""Vapor"" that is designed to address your use case.   Myself, I am hacking together something for #2, since it will let people without anything installed locally to experience an ethereum app, at least to a limited extent. However, unless your server code is written in nodejs, #2 is a PITA as well, since there's no good way of ""talking"" to geth right now, except through the web3 javascript library... If you are using a different server side language, you either have to implement your own ABI function definition parsing, or have to do some raw UNIX piping to interact with the raw geth console... I've written some gnarly code to do the latter in Clojure, which let's me talk to the geth console directly from my web server.  (I'm just a lone wolf developer though, some people at ethdev may be able to supply corrections to my understanding of things)"
ethereum,39xakt,drcode,2,Mon Jun 15 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"Very nice summary Conrad. I would only add that with this pull request rpc will accept raw transactions. So you can use any central service to relay the transactions for you and do not really need to worry about security of the line.   Caveat is, you need to take care of nonce juggling, gas price estimation, and signing within your app. For some of this you can use ethereujs-tx and ethereumjs-util by null radix. And whatever is missing by you :)"
ethereum,39xakt,decypha,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:54:15 2015 UTC,You mean something like:  web3.eth.contract(abi).at(address).someMethod(...);   If you want to be able to call ethereum contracts on your laptop from the server (security considerations aside) you can bind the rpc port to a public facing IP or via NAT/port forwarding/ssh tunnel that's accessible from the webserver and handle the calls to RPC server side via JSON-RPC.
ethereum,39xakt,aedigix,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:50:50 2015 UTC,@drcode - I want to demo a contract so for now option 3 is what I want to go with even though it may not be secure  Option 2 - This does not work for me as the webpage will be deployed on a web hosting site like ipage or godaddy.There's no way of deploying a ethereum node there.  When we run geth with rpc option can some webpage from other server access node if the rpc information is known and also the account password to unlock it ?

ethereum,39xakt,heliumcraft,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:05:44 2015 UTC,@heliumcraft - Can I deploy app on separate webserver and access node on my laptop using embark ?
ethereum,39woun,etherminer24,10,Mon Jun 15 12:28:40 2015 UTC,This is due to no limit on the amount of transactions that can be accumulated in the transaction pool it self. This requires a lot of data to be pumped over every time someone connects.  Currently I'm working on a different strategy that will be merged later today (as well as a new release).  Sit tight!
ethereum,39woun,jeffehhh,6,Mon Jun 15 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, and someone was sending a lot of large transactions which made me discover this issue. Thanks, whoever you are!"

ethereum,39woun,jeffehhh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:34:33 2015 UTC,Is there a reward for successfully attacking the network? :P I am curious about if it was me. Can you tell us the address which sent the high number of large tx that caused the dos?
ethereum,39woun,PhiStr90,2,Mon Jun 15 17:50:09 2015 UTC,awesome!
ethereum,39woun,lozj,3,Mon Jun 15 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Same chain but extremely hard to catch up when those large blocks appear. If you notice, we get greens as soon as they disappear even for a short period."
ethereum,39woun,lumierr3,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:48:56 2015 UTC,"So, basically... as soon as we see 60x per block, the network struggles to stay synch'd?  Gas price is going to have to be high to stop spam from happening and bogging down the network...  60tx per block is about 5tx per second... a bit slower then bitcoin can theoretically handle."
ethereum,39woun,Grizmoblust,3,Mon Jun 15 13:21:42 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I said a year ago. The shareholders could spam huge size blocks to bog the network into useless levels. This was my biggest concern with ethereum to date.   If you set fees too high, then people will not use it. In theory, it sounds good. But in practice, this is the proof of it. Technically, this is aim for light apps. Large blocks should be denied as default."
ethereum,39woun,throwaway36256,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:21:51 2015 UTC,60tx per block is about 5tx per second... a bit slower then bitcoin can theoretically handle.   Normal Bitcoin tx. You can get 1 tx with thousands of input and thousands of output and it will still get bogged.
ethereum,39woun,FaultyMelon,3,Mon Jun 15 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"That's not really comparable. Despite not having any sort of pricing on opcodes, Bitcoins scripting system is designed in such a way that you can never really use enough elements to cause any level of delay in verification (there's very hard limits per block). Script execution is also done when you receive a Bitcoin transaction through the network and then cached, meaning you don't actually have to verify much at all by the time you see a new block. The slowest part is the ECDSA verify, for which Ethereum is already using a substantially faster library for than Bitcoin (where libsecp256k1 is used only for signing due to safety concerns)."
ethereum,39woun,throwaway36256,2,Mon Jun 15 14:33:40 2015 UTC,"Despite not having any sort of pricing on opcodes, Bitcoins scripting system is designed in such a way that you can never really use enough elements to cause any level of delay in verification (there's very hard limits per block).   I'm not talking about input and output to the script. I'm talking about input and output as in the same context as this page:  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction   The slowest part is the ECDSA verify,   If you have multiple lots of input and output you will have a lot of ECDSA verify, that's why Bitcoin has transaction fee determined by the size of tx in kb."
ethereum,39woun,FaultyMelon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about input and output to the script. I'm talking about input and output as in the same context as this page   The scriptSig (""input"") and scriptPubKey (""output"") are concatenated and executed as one script. There's a hard limit on that, a cap on the number of operations you can have in a block and it still being valid (20,000 operations, of which the most expensive to process is an EC signature verification).    If you have multiple lots of input and output you will have a lot of ECDSA verify, that's why Bitcoin has transaction fee determined by the size of tx in kb.   You can't have a fee on the value of a transaction due to change outputs, a fee per kilobyte is unorthodox from a user experience perspective but about all that could have been done. The size is really orthogonal to the verification cost of a transaction, 1MB of OP_CHECKSIG is a lot more expensive than 1MB of OP_NOP. It would have been been nicer to factor in the relative cost of operations into the signature operations hard limit, but the scripting system itself was an incredibly late addition to Bitcoin as it was."

ethereum,39w4yn,bahatassafus,3,Mon Jun 15 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"""... please let’s be clear: there is nothing magical about the Go client having gone through an auditing process. We are aiming to have all clients through at least a basic auditing process by the Homestead release and I see no reason to use the Go client over other clients (C++ or Python) at this stage, nor, for the vast majority of users, during Frontier. No clients come with any guarantees. Indeed there’s the argument that minority clients, being a smaller target, are less likely to be attacked."""
ethereum,39w4yn,avsa,6,Mon Jun 15 20:44:54 2015 UTC,"The bad chain canary is a simple contract. It is controlled by a single key (though there may be several of them) and sits quietly until poked by its owner. I will be one such owner, Vitalik and Jeff two others and there will likely be fourth, Christoph. [...] This allows the Ethereum core devs to inform everyone who is running a client on a bad chain (i.e. one that does not conform to the Yellow Paper due to a bug) that it is such. The default in clients (easily overridden) is not to mine on such chains.   This is not a good idea. Holders of this key can shut down most miners and take over the network with their own chain.

ethereum,39ujsp,lozj,8,Sun Jun 14 22:16:46 2015 UTC,i agree with this.    the mission of Ethereum is so attractive plus Ether holdings give option-like upside that Ethereum employees should have been taking less salary than market.  [Offhand I'd say 10-40% less than market]   This isn't just for fiscal conservatism.  It's also to weed out people who are not fully committed to the mission (eg xcthulhu).
ethereum,39ujsp,vbuterin,14,Mon Jun 15 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"So, note that:   Most employees sent 20% of their salary into the employee ether purchase program, so the ""actual"" salaries are really 152k, 144k, 125k and 115k (at least, that's the way people would be interpreting it if had we simply added the employee purchases into the premine). Even including that additional ether, no single person received more than 0.98% of all ether from the premine. And ETH isn't even a share or equity and doesn't come with any kind of claim on percentages of profits of anything. Ethereum.org is a nonprofit. ""No founder of a startup I know"" takes home that kind of upside potential.   We definitely could have taken the other route, of having much lower salaries but premining a substantial amount of ether, but we didn't, primarily because the community was highly opposed to high degrees of premining. We also could have immediately created a for-profit, and had shares of that, but we also didn't. That's not to say that there won't be for-profits in the future but they certainly will NOT be taking ether crowdsale money.   Vitalik, do you think it makes sense that you make 150k usd a year?   Others in the foundation (ie. the ones who actually decided these salary numbers) offered me $185k at one point; I declined. Are those numbers reasonable? I'll admit I'm not qualified to judge, though I find the arguments that were raised both internally and in comments on this thread that others in similar positions earn as much or more reasonable. No idea about Brian Armstrong, but the only two high-level crypto industry salaries we have that got leaked are Gavin Andresen at $208k and Changpeng Zhao at $240k so we're clearly not too far off (Note that all this may be a tu quoque fallacy, but then the whole concept of ""paying X percent below market rates"" is tu quoque all the way down in any case)."
ethereum,39ujsp,luvasugirls,4,Mon Jun 15 01:55:07 2015 UTC,"Hey vbuterin. Just curious, do you think there is enough funding to get to serenity? That's my only concern. If there is, I really wouldn't care how much you get paid."

I have never seen such mismanagement of funds in my life. The way it looks is that everyone in the organization is giving themselves the highest justifiable salary and simply looking out for themselves. The thought that when this organization goes broke everyone will get up and leave shows that this is just a gravy train for these people. This is the 2nd biggest crowd funded project of all time and they can barely get a basic software release out the door. Nor have I seen any community outreach or attempt at marketing to a wider audience.  Everyone's salaries should be sliced in half and those who don't want to stay shouldn't have been there in the first place. This would double the runway and help align incentives. I guarantee most people there could be replaced by someone who would accept a third of the salary, greatly appreciate it, and do a better job. Nearly every other successful project in this space had people working on it with shoe string budgets.

ethereum,39qhfs,BroughtToUByCarlsJr,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:05:25 2015 UTC,How does Augur deal with routines that cost more than the block gaslimit? Do you somehow guess the gas cost and break up into multiple calls?
ethereum,39qhfs,playingethereum,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:39:56 2015 UTC,Yeah we just break up into multiple calls
ethereum,39qhfs,sputknick,3,Sun Jun 14 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in augur but not up to date. I know you can't go live until Frontier begins, how soon after Frontier do you expect to be operational? It seems like augur might be the main driving force for initial ethereum adoption."
ethereum,39qhfs,playingethereum,3,Sat Jun 13 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"current estimate is alpha: June, beta: August, release: November"
ethereum,39qhfs,disruptepreneur,2,Sat Jun 13 23:34:34 2015 UTC,I was looking for the crowd sale some time in mid-June - are those plans still accurate?
ethereum,39qhfs,kashivretwo,5,Sun Jun 14 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"We won't launch the crowdsale until at least a few days after Frontier launches, so it may be a bit."
ethereum,39qhfs,playingethereum,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much competition they will have, I feel it might be best to start a crowdsale now so development can start full speed."
