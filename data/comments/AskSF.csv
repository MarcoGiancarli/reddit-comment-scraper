AskSF,3e2u7q,wellvis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"Could not disagree more.  Yes, cioppino enjoys a reputation as being some sort of San Francisco signature dish, but for the most part it's only cooked for and sold to tourists, in tourist trap restaurants such as the ones at the Wharf.  It's not that cioppino can't be delicious, but this is already one of the world's great food cities, and the OP described him/herself as a ""foodie.""  You can't sent a foodie to the Wharf for a meal.  If you must have cioppino, our most prominent restaurant critic and local food overlord made a list last year of the best examples.  Since Sotto Mare makes the list, and since wellvis confirms it as his favorite above, I suppose that would be the one to try.  http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/07/15/where-to-find-the-best-cioppino-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area/#photo-490050"

AskSF,3e2u7q,wellvis,2,Tue Jul 21 23:16:46 2015 UTC,"Those ""touristy things"" can be a lot of fun, even if you've lived here a long time.  Alcatraz is interesting, but there's so much more to San Francisco than a decommissioned prison.  MUNI will get you pretty much everywhere you want within SF.  You probably don't want to have a car if you're visiting.  Parking is very expensive - see http://sanfrancisco.bestparking.com for public parking options.  If you're downtown or east of Twin Peaks (where most of the fun stuff is) you should be no further than two or three blocks from a bus or streetcar.  The iconic foods of San Francisco might give you a good idea of what to look for.  I'd say a good burrito in the Mission (try La Taqueria) will easily fit your needs.  Tony's Slice House in North Beach has some great pizza.  As foodies, you should make plans to visit the Ferry Building Farmers Market on Saturday.  Our weather isn't weird.  It's pretty consistent year around - night and morning low clouds and fog along the coast, clearing by midafternoon.  Bring layers - a hoodie or light jacket, long pants, and good walking shoes.  Much more information available by searching this subreddit or consulting the FAQ and Archive.  Have a great time!  Edit: Here's one guy's list of things to do in SF."

You can expand out to include chocolate (ghirardelli, but TCHO is a great step up), sourdough (Boudin), beer (21st amendment, anchor steam, speakeasy).

AskSF,3e068u,swollencornholio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Naa in that area it's pretty much always been that way. Union square has always kept the TL out of that area. The gentrification seems to be pushing the TL down south of Geary/O'farrell towards mid market (6th-10th st in SOMA). You see a lot of new construction and trendy bars on Geary/O'farrell. Here's a few recommendations for places to eat/drink in your immediate area:   Ryoko's (sushi) - usually a wait but with 2 people it goes fast... anymore and you'll prob have to wait an hour or so.  Bourbon and Branch - cool ""speakeasy"" bar. You'll have to go online a day or so in advance to make reservations. They will then call you with the password to get in. You can get in the Library pretty much any time  Redford - Pretty standard bar with damn good food and a pretty good happy hour for food and drinks."

Dollar bills and coins for Muni and Samtrans, into the farebox when you board. For Bart, you use the machine at the station to load a card with money, which you use to enter/exit the system.  Most convenient is to get a Clipper card which works on all the above and put some cash on it. Use it when you board and it'll deduct the right amount. I believe you can get one at the airport information booth, or if you have time, have it mailed to you before you leave. Downside is you may end up with some unused money on it when you leave.

If they want to evict you they can't talk about it and make you feel threatened of losing your home, they need to do an OMI with the city which has a standardized process/payout.

Monterey you could do on public transit if you want to. Most of what there is to see in Monterey is in walking distance from downtown.  You can take a Monterey Transit Bus from San Jose Caltrain all the way to Monterey and there are other buses that will take you to Carmel, Pt Lobos  even as far as Big Sur. Here is the Monterey Transit route list: http://mst.org/maps-schedules/route-list/  It is possible to do Yosemite on public transit but would probably be difficult to do it in a day. Once you're in the park there are shuttles that take you everywhere in the park and there is bus service from Merced into the park and Amtrak offers buses from San Jose to Merced  http://yarts.com/  The RT on tAmtrak is $48 and a $25 RT on the Yosemite bus... but you'd probably have to overnight in either the park or Merced to actually see anything.  For Muir Woods... you are pretty well stuck with a tour as it's a fairly long hike from the closest Marin Transit stop... I've also read recently that they are going to start requiring reservations.  You can also see great redwoods closer to San Jose. Buses go from San Jose to Santa Cruz and then from Santa Cruz to Big Basin State Park."

If you work in downtown S.F., lots of Oakland is closer by BART than lots of S.F. is by MUNI or car.  Distinctions: I think SF has better public schools.  Western SF has cooler weather, if you like the fog.  SF has a cachet that Oakland lacks - if you tell people from other places that you live in San Francisco, there is a positive association that is lacking if you say you live in Oakland.  There are more places in SF where you can live without a car if you choose.  If the parts of San Francisco are in outside of downtown, you'll save time every time you come in to town if you live in San Francisco.  That all said, you can get a place in a nice Oakland neighborhood for the same as you'd pay to live in one of the less pleasant neighborhoods in San Francisco.  Most parts of Oakland are also a lot easier to park.  There are lots of houses in Oakland with actual yards and space between houses.  That's less common and verrrry expensive in San Francisco.  I've lived in both Oakland and San Francisco.  I live in San Francisco now largely because I have other family in SF and because I really like the schools (my son is learning Mandarin Chinese, which was not available elsewhere when he started school.)  Since you seem to be a single guy, the schools probably don't matter to you.  Frankly, if I were single now, I'd probably leave the Bay Area entirely because of the enormous financial sacrifice required to live here (and there are more professional opportunities for my line of work outside of the Bay Area than in).  Have you considered Berkeley?  It's only a few minutes further from downtown SF via BART than Oakland, and there are lots of good restaurants and highly educated people."

I make a good salary and it's still tough to find a place.   Good luck"
AskSF,3dl3rg,wellvis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"You can use craigslist to see what sorts of jobs are out there and what you might be qualified to do.  This is an extremely expensive part of the country, so unless you have a good amount of money saved up and a really cool cousin, you could find yourself out on the street or back in DC pretty quickly.  Here's a cost of living calculator to help you figure out the cost differential between DC and SF."
AskSF,3dl3rg,roy_ayers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"I think the only situation where it's reasonable to move cross-country without a job lined up is if you have a lot of money saved up (especially moving somewhere like SF). Given you've been in school most of your life and have loans, I take it that's not the case. I say keep trying and, if possible, try to get some revenue during that time.  However it's been my experience that finding a job from across the country can be next to impossible, so if it's something you really want, eventually you might just have to take the jump. Just be smart about it!"
AskSF,3dl3rg,mliasobd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, I made the same move (DC to SF) last month for basically the same reason of really wanting to set out for something new. However, I had been offered a position back in April and was just waiting to finish out the school year before moving.  I flew out for a weekend at the end of May to do a massive housing hunt and was able to find a place to rent for a relatively cheap price. I'd highly suggest you pin down a source of income before coming because as they've all said, this city is NOT cheap. If you're set on moving out here, use all the resources you can to contact places and try to get a job. My take-home pay is just under $3000, but I live very frugally and don't have many expenses or any loans to pay off. It's great if you have savings that you can live off of, but I'd still recommend securing a job (preferably paid) as soon as you can. Like the other posters have said, it's not a bad idea to do a job hunt in person, but I definitely feel like you should do all the research and preparation you can before heading out."

If you drive, consider the Bay Bridge toll (usually $6.00 USD weekday mornings) and parking, which can be VERY expensive."
AskSF,3dh07e,contrappasso,3,Thu Jul 16 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"You might ask in /r/SFBayHousing, but as far as SF goes, I'd be surprised if you could find anything with more than 2BR/1Bath for your budget (assuming, of course, that your wife isn't also pulling in a significant salary). I'm sure that there exists something you can work with, but it will be an adventure to find it in the city.  How old are the kids? Are they all in school, or do you have any daycare/preschool ages? If housing wasn't crazy enough, childcare is insane here too. Unless you have someone who will stay home with them, you will need another $1500/month/preschooler.  Ok, I re-read your question, and you said you expect to commute in from outside the city, and I think that is probably your best bet. Housing is more affordable outside the city, and you would be much more likely to find a place that is roughly similar to what you have now, especially as you head farther out from SF. Also, there is plenty of public transportation so you can avoid parking costs (the monthly fee at my closest garage is $350..); I have co-workers who BART in from Walnut Creek in less time than it takes me to get across town on MUNI.

I took a quick glance at 4+ bedroom houses on Craigslist in that area, and it seems reasonable to find somewhere for about $2700 that's not too far from BART, so your commute wouldn't be a total nightmare. I lived in Martinez for a little while, and it's definitely got a very small-town feel to it. Pleasant Hill and Concord are a little busier--more suburban, for sure, but seems like there's more families around at least, and more stuff to do.

Most gave up, and BART'ed back into the city from Richmond and overnighted.   87K is not a lot for this area. With taxes/SS etc you will basically be looking at 60K net a year (ish with 4 dependents etc). CA state tax is one of the highest in the country.

Tipping at least $2 on the first drink of the night--whether it's beer or a cocktail--will show the bartender that you care about them and they will take care of you over the course of the evening. (This is a thing I have learned from being friends with bartenders.)  On a single cup of drip coffee, if it's $2.50 (standard for a lot of places) then I'll throw in the extra 50c into the tip jar. If I get an espresso type drink, I'll give a dollar. I don't care about ""over-tipping"" or whatever on small items like a cup of coffee, because that's what I pay for the convenience of not making my own at home for cheap, and half of those baristas have to keep crazy hours to serve me my morning cuppa. They deserve that extra couple quarters for getting up and being human at 4am and than I deserve for sleeping later.  Side note: ALWAYS CARRY CASH in this city--lots of places don't take cards and everyone wins if you don't have to hold up a line of pre-caffeinated or pre-liquored or pre-burrito'd folks because you couldn't be arsed to go to the ATM or pull out cash from the grocery store.    Most of my habits have been developed from many years of working in the service industry myself. The financial benefit of being a stingy tipper is minimal compared to the benefit that the server/barista/bartender will get from you tipping a little extra--especially because a lot of people are stingy tippers, and you might help make up for an inconsiderate person before you."

AskSF,3dfiad,LadiesWhoPunch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"In theory it should always just be their job. But because the US is weird about tipping, servers are paid less than minimum wage hourly and the restaurants only pays them up to minimum wage if their tips don't make it there. It's essentially moving the responsibility for server's wages from the business to the customer, and reducing the restaurant's payroll taxes (sketchy).  Even still, your servers work their asses off and should be paid more than minimum wage. Most restaurants don't have dedicated to-go employees, and even if they do, they're probably classifying them as servers so it's less out of their pocket. If no one tipped on their to-go orders, those employees would go home with $12.25 per hour in SF (less in the rest of the state). I think they deserve more than that, regardless of how backwards the system is.  TL;DR: It is part of their job, but the wages the restaurant pays do not adequately compensate them for that job, so that responsibility (for better or worse) falls on tipping."
AskSF,3dfiad,juaquin,6,Fri Jul 17 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"An easy way is to double the amount of tax (or more).    I typically tip if there is service.  If I am ordering at a counter, I will put money in the tip jar if the service was good or if I asked for anything special.  Otherwise, I don't typically tip for a straight transaction.  Be aware that some places automatically add a tip to the bill, especially if you are in a large group.  Also, don't forget non food service people, like hotel maids and other service industries.  I have friends that are adventure guides, and most people forget to tip them."

AskSF,3dfiad,contrappasso,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:00 2015 UTC,"Look at you, trying to make the US tip culture make sense.  Doesn't matter whether the employer doesn't take tip credits, doesn't matter whether you're paying a health care surcharge to help the restaurant provide health coverage (or not provide it), doesn't matter whether any other charges (other than an explicit gratuity/service charge) appear on your bill.  You're still expected to tip somewhere close to 20% on a sit-down meal. If you don't, servers and others will consider you a stingy customer who is stealing service and not doing your part to help restaurant staff live a decent life in an expensive city.  Doesn't have to make sense. It's just the way it is."

AskSF,3dfiad,wellvis,5,Wed Jul 15 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, these are the types of discussions I was reading, and they all mention something like the following:   Tips are often a major source of compensation for wait staff and other U.S. service providers.  Employers often pay these employees lower wages in anticipation that tip income will provide a significant portion of the employees' income.    My confusion comes in that here in SF (as far as I am aware), employers must pay at least min. wage (and healthcare?) so they aren't paying them lower in the hopes tips make up the remainder, which is why I thought 15% for excellent service would be a pretty good tip. Did I hear it wrong from my buddy that waiters make min. wage here or is there some other logic behind still giving 18-25% even though the waiters are paid at least min. wage by the employers (and the prices reflect in the food from what I've seen compared to other cities)."

If you don't leave a decent enough tip, it means the server literally pays for you to eat there.    If you screw a bartender or server on tipping, watch how enthused they will be to see you the next time you're there.  I tip my bartenders pretty well (almost always $2 a drink, $1 for free water because it takes them just as much time to use the gun compared with something alcoholic) and always get stiff drinks that are free on occasion.    And while it's true that somebody will take a minimum $10 or so an hour if you leave a small tip, that's a poverty wage in SF.  Be kind to your wait staff and they will be kind to you."
AskSF,3dfiad,ManuelLabor,2,Wed Jul 15 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure if this applies to SF, but in many places in the U.S., those with jobs where tipping is expected (such as of course waiters and waitresses) may be making LESS than minimum wage (kind of makes the ""minimum"" in ""minimum wage"" meaningless, huh). I know of people who make about $2 an hour which makes their paychecks pretty much $0 after taxes and all that. Even if SF is not like that (it might be, I don't know) it is absolutely expected to tip 18-20% at minimum. The tipping is not a ""I'm being nice"" charge, it's just how it is. Consider it part of the cost and just move on. If you have excellent service you can of course tip more and no one will mind.   As for the prices, that's SF for you. Things are expensive here and are not a reflection of the wages. Normal tipping is still expected.   Note that there are some exceptions where the restaurant does not accept tips. However in my experience there were signs everywhere that made it very clear to not tip. Tipping is so engrained in our culture that it will be very obvious if tipping is not expected."

If you can afford a $200 meal you should be able to afford the tip.  Don't cheap out by not tipping on the cost of the alcohol, that's a cheap bastard thing to do. At a bar, plan on $1 per drink. Throw in a little extra for complicated stuff, good service, or if you want to ensure the bartender takes your next order promptly.

AskSF,3dfgeg,rawrhisspurr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:46:57 2015 UTC,"A cousin of mine worked at Google for about 6 years, starting off here in Mountain View for a couple of years, then London, then Dublin for 2 years.   A couple of things about her move to Dublin:  - she was requested to relocate, not her wanting to move, because they were establishing Google's EU headquarters in Dublin and she was a senior manager for DoubleClick.  - she'd been at Google for 2-3 years by that point  - She also went to the London School of Economics (after graduating from University of Indiana and studying abroad at LSE for a year), so she already knew the European markets prior to the move.  I visited her once in Dublin, and the offices there were awesome!!! I think the layout of the offices is that Google bought every building down this short street, and made each building into a department. My cousin was a part of two departments, Sales and Marketing, and would have to go across the street for different meetings.  As for assimilating into life in Dublin, Google (and pretty much any company that sends employees abroad and/or cares about their employees) sets up events for new employees to meet, get to know each other, and explore Dublin together. For example, my cousin and I met up with a few of her coworkers after work for a hilarious comedy night at a local pub, then went clubbing together until the weeee hours of the morning.  My cousin had an absolute blast living and working in Dublin, and only moved back to Mountain View because they asked for her to relocate again."

AskSF,3dbbgn,Kcam717,6,Tue Jul 14 23:08:22 2015 UTC,I'd consider the Richmond. There's a ton of bars and restaurants in walking distance. It's a safe neighborhood with plenty of street parking (no permit needed) and only once a month street cleaning (at least in the outer Richmond). I pay $2000 for a studio but it's a good size and includes a parking spot.   Hope this helps. Good luck with the move!

AskSF,3dbbgn,mexicatl,3,Wed Jul 15 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"On top of the Richmond, you should also look at Ingleside, Oceanview and the Excelsior. They might be a bit more expensive in terms of rent, but not by much and have the added advantage of being near BART. Driving into Downtown is not a pleasurable experience, particularly around the Ferry Building and unless you have parking, expensive. It's easier to take transit into work."

On that note, eat at Tu Lan.  It's not like you'll be in the middle of a huge ghetto, you only have to move a couple blocks to have a much different vibe. And like I said, the issue will likely be more about ""quality of life"" on the street than actual danger to your person.   Central location, and you'll be spending most of your time around the city.

AskSF,3dblyg,TheMunch8,2,Wed Jul 15 07:22:09 2015 UTC,"Look it is sketchy and definitely not a good choice, but it is centrally located, cheap, and booked. 6th and Mission is in the little snippet of Tenderloin that still exists South of Market. Since it has been cut off by all the gentrification going up on Market and the hipster/tech places pushing up from Folsom. It is a relatively short distance to quickly get out to a different area. Honestly as long as your GF isn't the type to freak out, and you aren't hoping to be sitting on the street outside your hotel, I would just go with it and be cautious after all that is just where you will be sleeping and the hotel itself should be fine. People on that specific 1 block radius will be a little extra crazy, beggy, drugged out, and you may witness a crime or two from your window.  The thing about that location is that everything around is getting gentrified like crazy. 1 block NE up Mission and you are at a super nice area where you really don't have to worry. 1 block up 6th (after you hit market make sure to go right if you want to avoid walking forward into TL) and you are practically at Powell bart which is pretty much the main SF bart station for all the tourists. Just try to go in one of those two directions for a block and then you can meander to any of the Downtown touristy places at your leisure.   At night if you want to be overly cautious/not have to deal with a block of mostly druggy/homeless people stuff call a lyft(lyft line) or an uber from that location and just get picked up/dropped off at the hotel door. If you drove, why? Don't do that, it's SF cars will get broken into and bikes will be stolen no matter where you are in the city."

AskSF,3d9v4j,scotttr,3,Tue Jul 14 17:33:50 2015 UTC,Caltrain is the best way to get from San Jose to SF without a car. You can get to the San Jose airport by going to the Santa Clara Caltrain station and taking the VTA route #10.   Best place for a burrito is like asking what the best religion is.
AskSF,3d9v4j,MattLaroche,5,Tue Jul 14 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"We will be staying in a hotel in fishermans wharf for two nights and plan to do some exploring. What is a good walking route to take to see what the city has to offer?   From Fisherman's Wharf, you can easily walk up to North Beach and explore the area immediately around Washington Square Park.  It's a little bit uphill, but the grade is not very steep at all.  As you're walking S/SE from Fisherman's Wharf you can see up Lombard to your right to see the crooked part from a distance, as well as Coit Tower some distance to the left atop Telegraph Hill.  There are a lot of restaurants in North Beach, most of which are in the triangle made by Columbus, Filbert, and Grant.  As you crest Columbus and head down towards Broadway, you can get a nice view of the Transamerica Pyramid, and the Sentinel Building.  You can also get a nice view looking east out to the Bay Bridge.  If you're into books, check out City Lights Bookstore, which is a Historic Landmark.  From there you can walk down into Chinatown, probably down Grant Ave.  And you can either take this all the way down to Union Square, or hop on the California cable car (on California St.) going uphill/west and take it up through Nob Hill to Polk St.  If you go down to Union Square, it's just kind of a shopping district.  I don't personally see the appeal or understand why people go there, but lots of people do.  So that's definitely an option, and you can take cable cars all the way back up Powell through Nob Hill and Russian Hill back to Fisherman's Wharf.  These are nice, very ""San Francisco""-ey neighborhoods.  If you take the Hyde line up, you can hop off at Lombard and walk down the crooked part, if you want.   If you take the California cable car up through Nob Hill over to Polk St., you can walk north up Polk all the way back up to Fisherman's Wharf (a couple of blocks uphill, very mild grade, mostly downhill).  There's a lot of bars and restaurants along Polk between California and Union.  So you could easily make a whole day of doing this circuit and do lunch in North Beach and Dinner on Polk, both places have affordable and delicious options.    Another great San Francisco ""explore""y option is renting a bike, riding it along the waterfront and over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito, and taking a ferry back.  Or if not across the bridge, at least along the Bay Trail.  Or you could just walk it.  Great views, weather permitting.      For burritos, the Mission for sure.  It's a bit out of the way from Fisherman's Wharf, but if you make your way over there, you could take a walk up/down Valencia and around Mission Dolores.  I personally also enjoy the walk up/down 24th as well, but it's up to you whether that sounds like fun or not.  There are tons and tons of good, cheap food in this quadrant of the city."

The ""scene"" is different for a five year old Chinese boy in the Sunset, for a 25 year old Wisconsin transplant in Noe Valley, for a 78 year old Russian in the Richmond, etc.  There are plenty of generalizations about the 38 different official neighborhoods available online.

AskSF,3d9rig,wellvis,6,Tue Jul 14 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"I moved here back in March after having only visited the city for 2 days last summer. I spent the last 5 years living in NYC & 25 years prior to that (aka my whole life) in Florida. I genuinely love it here.  Not knowing what you're looking for or where you're coming from, I can only tell you what it's been like for me. This has been the most balanced place I've lived so far. The weather is temperate (Florida is extremely hot, and NY has had a few brutal winters). The public transportation isn't the greatest I've experienced, but it's abundant and you definitely don't need a car to get around. Though if you do have a car, driving isn't as terrible as you might think. Parking varies per neighborhood, but you'll get a feel for it after a short while. The people (with some exception) are kind and talkative. They'll say hello as you pass, or you'll chat with the cashier at the grocery store about your day, or have interesting conversations with your Lyft/Uber driver. Almost every person I've met has been excited to hear that I'm new and has so many tips to offer me about the city. City life is exciting, there's always plenty to do. Events, concerts, meet-ups, city wide celebrations, etc. But the quieter things still exist too, the Presidio, Dolores Park, Ocean Beach, so much to do outside. And it's really simple to get outside of the city if you do have a car. There's a ton of vineyards, beaches, and national forests. Big Sur is only a few hours away. Santa Barbara is about a 4-5 hour drive. There's 3 major airports within a reasonable distance (SFO, Oakland, and San Jose). With a crowd as diverse as San Franciscans you're likely to meet a good community of people you can relate to. Fresh produce and healthy food is abundant. The emphasis put on environmental well being is inspiring (it'll kill you when you visit cities that don't compost).   I could go into more detail but the gist of it is that if you're comfortable with, or can overlook, the high cost of living, there's something here for most everyone. And even if you don't end up staying in the city for very long, I think you'd benefit from having lived here. Hope that helps. Good luck!!"

Yet somehow, they have forgotten that they somehow became part of the fabric of the city and accepted to the place, just as the the ""Techies"" will too at some point.   Also...the truth about Spain (i'm actually Irish, and lived in Spain for 8 years) is that if you speak the language, go the bars and restaurants in your barrio and respect the culture, in that you actively partake...you'll be accepted. There is huge wealth disparity in Madrid - there can be 10 room apartments in the same building as a one bedroom studio - people get on, knowing that disparity is going to happen no matter what - the reality is, that the ""king"" and ""pauper"" that live in the same building will be sat at the same terrace bar on a hot evening - bringing some equality to life."

We're all very different people.  You get wild stuff here (such as random pedestrians wearing bondage leather), but also very conservative folks in suits.  There's an art crowd, tech crowd, mom-and-dad-and-baby-in-the-park crowd, etc.  It's also very multicultural, like seeing non-caucasians is very common here.  Hearing Chinese/Thai/French/Hindi/etc as you walk is also not unusual. It's a very nice tapestry of different folks just letting each other be.  What do you love/hate about the lifestyle? I don't like the high prices of pretty much everything.  It's more expensive Down Under but there are much higher wages there.  I don't like that there are so many homeless people suffering all over town, and that so many people are being thrown out of their houses as the city gentrifies and rental prices skyrocket.  I like that the city has character.  I love the perfect weather. I adore this city for not subjecting me to snow-shoveling during winter, and monsoon rains in September.  What's the scene?

Lyfts are more likely to be people doing it as a side job, often more friendly, quirkier (not always good), and sometimes not as professional (don't quite know where to go). Uber, on the other hand, tend to be more professional but sometimes robotic or gruff. Seems like a lot of former Taxi drivers came over and they're not always friendly or accommodating. There are of course exceptions and this is just the general vibe I get from many rides, but they're both good services.  If you're from out of town, I would say try Lyft.

I've had plenty of good conversations with Uber drivers too, but they don't seem to have a ""be the rider's best friend"" mandate which makes the whole thing feel much less forced.  Other than awkward conversations, though, I haven't had an actual bad experience on either Lyft or Uber despite using the latter as my primary mode of transport in the city.  Occasionally I'll take a taxi just because there happens to be one approaching when I want a ride.

I also regularly have a night meeting near Lake Merritt BART and the Oaklanders there always insist on driving me the 3 blocks back to BART despite my insisting that I'm fine to walk.

Every Wednesday night, from 6-9 p.m. I think, they have a wine-tasting function at the back by the bar.   Each Wednesday is a different theme (i.e. Wines of Chile, Wines of Spain, Pinot, etc.).  It's been a while, but I think it's $15.  As for taking classes, a young person at this tasting asked about that, inquired about classes at Berkeley, etc.  The owners response was as follows:  Taking a class is not recommended.  Unless you have a serious career in the wine or restaurant industry, there's a lot of very boring information you don't need to know if you're not in those fields.  Also, it's work, and when it's work, there's little that interesting or fun about it.  He recommended having wine parties/group events with your friends, it's social, it's fun, and you learn from each other.    Edit:  To elaborate on alternatives to taking an academic class, consider wine clubs, groups, etc. in addition to organizing on your own.

Walk through the park and head towards 18th Street. 18th Street between Dolores and Mission has some excellent food choices - Bi-Rite Ice Creamery, Delfina for pizza, Tartine for pastries, etc.  Walk around Valencia Street and Mission Street for a wide variety of food and shopping options.

It's not impossible to find something for less downtown that not a scam though. You can find much larger housing in Richmond and Sunset for 2k or less. It's a ways away from downtown though. I would check out Inner Sunset or Inner Richmond if you didn't have to live downtown and wanted to not pay 3k. You can get a spot in these locations for 2,500. The commute isn't quick but it's also not terrible. Best of luck."

AskSF,3cq5of,boushLoush24,3,Thu Jul 9 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps saying: ""it's so expensive to live there"" and I know that's partially true but c'mon its gotta be do-able?!   Is it doable? Yes. But it's really difficult. Chalk it up to a hot employment market and even hotter real estate market. Everyone is trying to move in and there's simply not enough physical space to accommodate everyone.    What's up with the BART really? The EL in Chicago works well and is reliable. I keep hearing people say ""in some areas the BART isn't reliable?"" Like what is it just not going to show up?   BART is fine! However, due to a lack of infrastructural investment, there's only one track on the lines. So, a broken train, a broken track, loss of power, etc., those delays are catastrophic since the lack of doubletracking means BART can't go around the issue. So little hiccups have a butterfly effect that can wreak havoc on the system. But, on the most part, BART will get you to your destination quickly.    For an aspiring tech person like me, is it truly the tech motherland or is that a lot of hype?   Both. SF and the Silicon Valley is home to huge tech giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter. But, due to aforementioned living issues, you're starting to see places like Austin, NYC, and Portland have booming tech industries, as well. This is still Tech Mecca but other places are slowly catching up.     My tip for you is to land a job here first before moving. Get that job offer and use it as leverage to get an apartment with a roommate."
AskSF,3cq5of,culdesaclamort,3,Thu Jul 9 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"It is doable, but you have adjust your comfort levels and be prepared for sticker shock.   Take a look at craigslist, and add $400 to the units you see. That is what you'll be paying in 2017 if the current property market stands. Will you be comfortable with that?   If not, what is your commute tolerance?   Aside from Rent, it is actually pretty affordable. The climate is fine, to warm enough to need AC, not cool enough to need heating year round. We are all electric and our bill for a 2bd is $60 a month. Food is as expensive or cheap as you want.   Bart is fine when it shows up, but if there's a suicide or a broken down train (like this morning) there can be delays."

I mean, they aren't lying. It's true, not partially true. It's expensive and competitive and only getting worse. Whether it's ""doable""…. you really should crunch the numbers once you know what you're making. Check padmapper.com or craigslist for rents, and craigslist, indeed, and dice for jobs/salary ranges.  I live in the city by BART and Muni and don't have a problem much with either other than Muni is slow.   It is nice to be here and in tech, yes. Aspiring, maybe not so much.

Get yourselves into a 1bd rent controlled apartment.  That's your best bet for getting ahead, unless you want to have 2+ other roommates.  I live in Glen Park, which is nice and in a good transit area for the city (south of the traffic if you want to head down the peninsula, bart station for downtown/oakland, J line for the castro and 24th St).  However it's not very night-lifey around here, compared to where the happenin' neighborhoods are.  Bart is very reliable, but as someone else stated, when there's a delay the whole system goes bad.  But that doesn't happen often.  It's probably to the EL what the EL is to the NTC subway- more restrictive, but cleaner.  It's tech craziness both in the city and south in Silicon Valley.

Parking is scarce in many SF neighborhoods, and car break-ins are common in all of them. Do not leave anything at all visible in your car or it will be broken into.  As for neighborhoods, you haven't given a whole lot to go on, but youngish people who like to drink alcohol tend to enjoy the mission, Hayes Valley, and Lower Haight areas of town in particular. Those areas can seem rougher than they really are - if you stay reasonably alert and aren't wandering around blackout drunk at 3AM your chances of being mugged are pretty low, but your chances of seeing an elderly woman poop on the sidewalk in front of you are fairly high."

AskSF,3ckibd,Fr3nchpickler,4,Wed Jul 8 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"If you're staying in the Richmond check out Richmond Republic Draught House.  Lots of  good California beers there.  It's on Clement and 7th-ish.  It's a great beer bar/restaurant.  Chomp & Swig is also a good place for beers in Richmond.  Their list is far smaller than Richmond Republic's but it's curated well.    In addition to Off the Grid in the Presidio on Sundays there's also an Off the Grid in Fort Mason on Friday nights.  Both are relatively close to the Richmond District.  For a nice dinner in the Richmond District I highly recommend the aptly named restaurant ""The Richmond"".  It doesn't have beach views but it's a great little spot that is quite affordable (in SF terms) considering the ambiance and quality of food.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-richmond-san-francisco    Aziza is also a really well respected restaurant in the Richmond.  It's worth check out as well but it'll cost you more than The Richmond.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/aziza-san-francisco  I little further east and you could always check out a restaurant called NOPA as well.  Reservations aren't really going to be available but it's not too hard to camp out in the bar area and grab a seat for yourself as they are first come first serve.  I also highly recommend this restaurant.  I'm going to be there sometime in the next week with some out of town family I have visiting.  We don't have reservations but I'm confident we'll get a seat at the bar.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/nopa-san-francisco  There aren't many places in SF with true Ocean/Beach views.  The Cliff House and the Beach Chalet are your only true options for a nice dinner but I wouldn't necessarily recommend them.  If you head to the other side of the city (as far east as you can go) you can check out places along the Embarcadero for Bay water views (no beach views with crashing waves though).   Places to consider would be Waterbar, Epic, Le Mar, Hard Water, Hog Island Oyster Company...some others in there too."

It's fun to see the old prison, and there are some great views from the island and the ferry, but the amount of time that it takes could be better spent in the city proper if your trip is short."
AskSF,3ciahl,AvatusKingsman,7,Wed Jul 8 03:15:20 2015 UTC,It depends on your tastes and desires but as far as the super touristy things go this one is actually a legitimate one to do.
AskSF,3ciahl,instant_michael,4,Wed Jul 8 03:54:36 2015 UTC,"I would say so!  Alcatraz is a pretty good trip, it just takes several hours.  As for hotels with a view, I would imagine that the Marriot downtown has good views (the bar at the top is literally called The View after all) and near that is also the Intercontinental which is pretty tall as well.  Places not to walk at night?  The Tenderloin for sure.  Market Street gets sketchy after the 6th Street intersection regardless of time of day.  SOMA can be bad depending on the area, the closer to the Tenderloin or Civic Center in SOMA, the worse it tends to get.  Other than that, just always keep your wits about you at all times regardless of where you are."

I have heard from multiple people about being randomly attacked for no reason by people in one of the two categories above. Although I've also seen a few folks have cell phones snatched out of their hands as they wander blindly down the street (both times that happened near Powell St. station).

AskSF,3ciq2r,llaaronll,3,Wed Jul 8 08:59:43 2015 UTC,I dated someone who attended UC Davis and this is exactly what I did.   Amtrak to Richmond => Walk through the station to BART => take BART to SFO. It's very easy and painless. You literally don't leave the station. I advise against Emeryville since you'll have to hop on a bus to get to BART or take a taxi.
AskSF,3ciq2r,culdesaclamort,2,Wed Jul 8 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"It's been years since I rode Amtrack, but I think the deal is still the same:  Get off at Emeryville, there is a bus which goes directly to the City and has drop-off points in various locations, mostly where the hotels are, Union Square, Pier 39, etc. To take BART, the one nearest the Ferry Building/Market street would be better the the Caltrain station.  I don't know if your flight is intl or domestic, if you have luggage, but less than 6 hours from Davis seems cutting it pretty close."
AskSF,3ciq2r,eugenesbluegenes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:51:09 2015 UTC,"International and yes luggage :) normally 2 hours before departure is enough, so that's why I wanted to be there around something like 9 a.m.   I am staying in Davis so I was thinking of getting the amtrak to SF and then taking a BART because amtrak doesn't stop at the airport. So leaving at 6 am by train Capitol Corridor and then taking the Thruway bus, I would arrive at 9 a.m. Hmm a bit close on schedule .. :P"
AskSF,3ciq2r,culdesaclamort,5,Wed Jul 8 10:41:15 2015 UTC,"As the other commenter suggested, you want to Amtrak to Richmond and board BART there. If you try to do Emeryville or Caltrain you have to mess around with bus connections."
AskSF,3ciq2r,culdesaclamort,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:32:04 2015 UTC,Ok so: Davis CA -> Berkeley CA. Makes 24 dollars and go to BART but then I do need to make a transfer between BART trains (need to get into the yellow line). Or is there a different train stop which connects to the yellow BART line to the airport right away?  how long will BART take from Around Berkeley to the airport? :) Because it is only 1 hour and 17 minutes from Davis to Berkeley (which is pretty fast compared to some other options I found)
AskSF,3ciq2r,eugenesbluegenes,3,Wed Jul 8 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"Davis CA -> Berkeley CA   This complicates things still. Once you get to Berkeley's Amtrack station, you're 1 mile out from BART so you'll need to take a bus or taxi to North Berkeley BART station => take BART to Macarthur station => transfer to SFO bound train  You really really should just go Amtrak => Richmond BART => Macarthur Station => SFO. You eliminate the need to transport yourself to a BART station since the Berkeley and Emeryville stops are not connected to BART."

If you're into any kind of sports you can find leagues that are active and laid back.  There are tons of meetups on meetup.com that you can filter based on your interest. I would also look at alumni groups for your school - they might have regular meetups.  Good luck."

I'm a social person, and can make conversation with people, but have a harder time connecting and finding a solid group of people who I can really feel relaxed around and comfortable hanging out with outside of designated events. Some things that I am trying are meetups, to get out more and try new things, but I will be trying social kickball league this season too. I think things that meet regularly and have a social element, like classes or teams, will help me get to know someone and relate to them a bit better.

Can't you just check on clippercard.com to see the activity log? I'm assuming their scanner pulls from the same data, so I'm not sure why you would find anything different, but maybe it would at least give you enough information to reconstruct what happened. Maybe they were right - maybe you didn't put any money on the card, or maybe you had already spent it. In any event, the activity log might provide some clarity."

AskSF,3chp3f,lifix,2,Wed Jul 8 21:38:01 2015 UTC,"Do I still have to tag on and tag off every time I ride? I tried to this morning, but had a negative balance on my card.   This is really bad communication on the part of the Clipper people. When you tag on with your clipper card, essentially money is debited from your clipper card. If you never tag off, they take the maximum possible fare you could have paid off your clipper card, so when you first tag on, on your commute, you'll notice it says your clipper card has a negative balance.  When you tag off, after taking the train, the clipper system will put the money back into your account that it debited when you tagged on. So as long as you keep tagging on and off, you'll be fine. But if you forget to tag off, you're going to start building a negative balance on your clipper card."

AskSF,3c8mm2,multifidus,2,Sun Jul 5 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"I used Upack to move from SF to Alaska. What worked really well for us was that we hired professional movers to move us out of our apartment and load up the Upack truck (I boxed things myself). Although it was an extra cost, they packed up the truck so well that I'm sure they saved us a chunk of money in footage, as Upack does charge by the foot.  It was a good experience for us, but the moving company we used actually warned us that they had had customers who'd complained & warned against Upack. The main complaint was that a lot of items ended up damaged and broken on the other end of the x-country trip. I think it was okay for us because we did have have the moving company load the trailer (well packed, a lot less shifting/movement than if I had done it myself), and because we moved to Alaska, I think our trailer was actually on a boat for most of the trip, rather than jiggling and bumping across interstates."

Accessible seating options are available throughout the ballpark in all of the seating categories and view perspectives (see BALLPARK MAP). Assisted listening devices are available upon request at the Guest Services Office located on the Promenade Level behind Section 119. In addition, all restrooms, drinking fountains, telephones, ATMs and counters at points of service at AT&T Park are accessible.

You might also look into their own shuttle service for getting to places like Lawrence hall of science.  I've also ridden the LBNL shuttle to get to special lectures and seminars. Stanford, being on the peninsula, is best served by SamTrans, Caltrain, and VTA.  From the Palo Alto station ""hub"" Stanford has their own campus shuttle.

Just to give you an idea (driving time assumes off peak hours):   To get to UCB will take 1.5hrs+ as opposed to 50 minutes by car. You will need to take a bus to the BART (http://bart.gov) (local 'metro' system). To get to Stanford will take 2.5hrs+ and 2+ bus changes, as opposed to 35 minutes by car.

AskSF,3c0u13,sopunny,6,Sat Jul 4 00:23:41 2015 UTC,"Easily?   That´s $5 breakfast, $5 lunch and $10 dinner. Unless you´re planning on living off taquerias and slices of pizza, that is going to be tough. Even at that, you´re pushing it.   The $40-50 mentioned by OP is certainly doable though."
AskSF,3c0u13,eugenesbluegenes,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:57:06 2015 UTC,Chinatown has cheap food. You can get buns at a bakery for $1-2 and rice boxes for $5. I'm assuming you can find similar prices in other neighborhoods if you knew where to look.
AskSF,3c0u13,sopunny,2,Sat Jul 4 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"Chinatown is the only place I know where you can have an engorged stomach on $5 that's still nutritionally balanced. I guess you can find fairly large sandwiches at some places for a little over $5 (banh mi's are often cheaper but they're not big enough for a proper meal unless you're a little person or have a small appetite, in which case you'd just as well get a slice of pizza), but I don't think tourists are gonna have time or want to spend the time scouting for such places every meal every day."

Plus I'm not sure I would eat dim sum for a meal unless it's at a proper dim sum restaurant where they have more variety than just the few staple items of carbs/meat that most dim sum stores have. Like I can get full on bakery for cheap, and bakeries are everywhere, but that would be a pretty crappy meal. Personal opinion anyways (:   I'm Chinese so maybe I have higher standards, but the only two places in the city I would eat dim sum or Chinese take out that I know is both cheap enough and decent quality are Chinatown and Richmond/Sunset."

I usually get a sandwich for lunch at a place that runs me 7-8 bucks and then I'll grab a burrito for dinner again about the same. If I want a sit down meal I can find some awesome happy hours (bar crudos got a really good one) or budget for about 15 a person for a meal at a moderate place. Either way normally I spend less than 20 bucks a day on food.

Alternatively you can try to park in the sunset district... It's an area of the city known for having ample parking, but will definitely be very crowded on the day of the show.

Healthy Spirits really great out of the way liquor store with dudes that absolutely know their stuff about beer and bourbon. They're incredibly kind and helpful and not snooty at all, which I find to be kind of amazingly rare and beautiful in the city.  Suppenkuche I don't love the people and the service but the food is tasty and novel. German comfort food - the soft pretzel is incredible and I had a really interesting grapefruit beer there.  Polkers There are so many better burgers to be had in the city, but the food here is consistent, tasty and it's a very short walk from my apartment, so Polkers wins.  Suzu I'm always surprised by how low a Yelp rating Suzu has. I've sampled lots of different ramen around the city, and I still like Suzu best. It's a tiny store in the mall in Japantown, come on off-hours or else there can be a bit of a wait since they don't have a lot of seating.  Liguria hands down the best focaccia you will ever eat - even in Italy we haven't found a better piece. My personal favorite is the pizza - fresh hot focaccia covered in a thin layer of tart tomato sauce.

AskSF,3btg37,obnoxious_banana,3,Thu Jul 2 00:27:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal with bike rentals- no names, because conflict-of-interest: there's one really big company with locations all over the city, several smaller ones with a few outlets, and many mom-and-pop bike shops that also rent bikes.  If you're at all independent and adventurous, go with the Mom-and-Pop.  The larger ones- and sometimes the smaller ones too- will offer group tours and often have special deals including ferry tickets back to the city- I don't recommend this because the wait and crowds to get on the ferries in Sausalito is out of control, esp. on weekends. Also, at the larger places the bike maintenance is often poor, many have worn, slipping gears and bad breaks- something you may not find out until you're on a steep hill. However, the larger places also offer electric-assist bikes, kiddie-trailers, etc.  My suggestion: find a bike shop that also rents, they may have better bikes and better personal service - there are at least 4 in North Beach alone- and ride to the Ferry Building, take a ferry to either Sausalito, or if you're independent and adventurous, to Larkspur, (the Tiburon peninsula is an amazing ride) and ride back into the city-  by going against the flow you'll avoid the most obnoxious crowds and traffic.  You don't mention your level of riding skill, but the whole circuit can be done, at a leisurely pace, in about 4 hours, not including any wait time- the ferries don't go all that often- and the ride, while not a huge athletic feat, does have some steep up and down hill parts, and might not be suitable for anyone who can't comfortably ride 20 miles or so in a day."

AskSF,3bsoiu,wellvis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"Most hotels are around Union Square or Fisherman's  Wharf.  Be cautious of hotels that advertise themselves as Union Square West because that can be a gritty area.

It is not especially dangerous, mostly substance abusers mostly who won't bother you.  There are some hotels in the area north of the described area and I would consider those ok.

You can't really go wrong with the hotel if you stick to the right zones.  As for things to do, it depends on what you are into.  If you are into good food, definitely go to the Ferry Building to walk around and try small bites (though I'd avoid Saturday.  That's the farmers market and added craziness) I would also take a culinary tour.  There are ones of North Beach, the Mission, Hayes Valley, Japantown, etc.  There are many non-food based walking tours as well if you want to wander various neighborhoods.

Daly City, South City, Pacifica and Colma often get so much fog you can not see fireworks displays. Most years we would not be able to see the local fireworks.   I can not remember whether San Bruno has a local fireworks show, but the legal fireworks are pretty fun. Most people in San Bruno manage to get a hold of the illegal stuff too.   My favorite place to go is Yerba Buena. You can see multiple shows from some areas. Traffic going in and out can be a bit of a bitch."

Costs for everything besides housing are relatively normal. Minimum wage here is higher than most places, and I guess that's why most daily expenses are a little higher here than most places. High-quality fresh produce and seafood are a little cheaper than the midwest.  As for the general quality: people here are generally tolerant of differences, optimistic about the future, and willing to take smart risks; we don't blame each other for occasional failures. Many people take regular exercise and enjoy outdoor activities. Many people have pets, even though many people live in apartments and it is somewhat difficult to find a landlord who tolerates pets. The city is quite walkable and public transportation is very good by U.S. standards (it is still pretty miserable compared to major cities of Europe or Asia, or NYC).  The one exception to tolerance is that there is quite a lot of resentment and negativity towards people who work in technology.  My tip is that you should visit here but do not try to move here with that income and education level. The only way people make it here on such low incomes is that they are living with roommates in rent-controlled apartments at rates from the 1980s (barely exaggerating), or in family homes."

Your best bet would be to find a roommate situation and probably to find a job here that paid more than 25k before you committed to moving out here. The economy is very good here, so that might not be as out of reach as you might think.   It's a unique city and is very much worth it if you can make it work."
AskSF,3bnqzz,wellvis,2,Tue Jun 30 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"There are various cost of living calculators that allow you to get a general idea of the costs of living in SF vs. wherever you are.  They don't have Iowa City listed, but Payscale has Cedar Rapids."
AskSF,3bnqzz,Fat_Taiko,2,Tue Jun 30 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"Cost of living is higher here than almost anywhere else in the country. Assuming you could find a very modest room for rent, you might still struggle at the income you described.   The good news is that with such a high cost of living, wages are higher on average too. SF just increased its minimum wage to $12.25, so you should see better than $20,000 for a minimum wage, full time job. And tons of jobs offer better than minimum wage! A friend just posted to facebook about hiring bicycle delivery riders at $17/hr.   Finding an affordable place (room) to rent will be your lynchpin - start there."
AskSF,3bnqzz,shempmalone,2,Tue Jun 30 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"It is quite pleasant, particularly if you have a lot of money. On $25K you would be struggling - not just to have fun, but to have basic food and shelter. Having said that it's pleasant, it's less special than it once was; while it retains its sleepiness compared to other major cities, it is rapidly loosing its quirkiness/creativity/cultural diversity, and it is basically becoming more like the bland upscale mall that Manhattan has turned into. If you want an urban experience, particularly on a low budget, think about other cities."

AskSF,3bm30h,lukalette,2,Tue Jun 30 09:10:35 2015 UTC,"It will depend on this winter's weather.  If it's been unseasonably warm and dry as it has been for the past few years, the Tioga Pass may still be open.  If the pass is closed, the detour could be extensive.  Forecasters are predicting a wet winter (finally), but there's no way to know this far in advance.  You may want to have alternative routes planned - for example, through Truckee and Reno on Interstate 80, then down Highway 395."

So, if Tioga's closed, then you add a couple hours of driving - as /u/wellvis points out. But I'd recommend a southern detour. 395 from Carson City to Death Valley is gorgeous, but if you're nervous about snow driving, I would not recommend it if it looks like snow.  Yosemite is amazing, it sounds like a good trip. If you don't have 5 days of things planned for Vegas, I would suggest shortening your duration a bit - I feel like 3 days is probably plenty."

But it's not a detour when you're from halfway around the world! I hope you have a great trip.

SF is not, and November is usually a beautiful time of year to visit (look up Indian Summer). As a native, I encourage you to stay as long as you can afford. Don't miss Yosemite. Vegas is an experience unlike many others, but I wouldn't recommend 5 days in a row to anyone. But you're right - to each their own - and that's my own sensibilities.  Day to Day can go from rain (and snow in the mountains if its cold enough - lately that's been iffy) one day to sunny and 18C the next.

Yosemite is quite the detour for a road trip to Vegas. You might want to schedule time there. Asking us to predict the weather isn't going to net you and reasonable plan.

AskSF,3bij4l,scotttr,10,Mon Jun 29 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"Wow that's funny I just moved from the Inner Sunset to Walnut Creek. I lived on 11th and Irving for 6 years. You will enjoy the neighborhood immensely for the criteria you listed. My favorite spots are Social Kitchen (brewpub), San Tung (Chinese, get the dry-fried chicken wings), Blackthorne (bar, used to be a dive but has changed to a little more upscale), Park Chow (American food with a sort of fusion of a ton of different cultures), Marnee Thai (Thai obviously), New Sandy's (Vietnamese but I only ever got the bahn mi), Perilla (Vietnamese as well I think but not completely sure that is correct, they have garlic noodles and some pretty good noodle soup/pho), Arizmendi's (co-op bakery great for breakfast, get the corn cherry scone and a coffee cake and your set), Posh Bagel (decent breakfast sandwiches) Gordos (Mexican) and Pasquale's (pizza when I'm drunk because they are open till 1 am).   9th and Irving has a lot to offer in terms of a night out or needing to grab an essential item and not wanting to go to a supermarket or major store. You can do grocery shopping at Andronicos but you won't leave the store without spending $50 no matter what you go in to get from there. Also with the N, or if you like to walk, you can get to even more shops, bars and restaurants near 19th and Irving. Also a brewery just opened up this year at 24th and Noriega called Sunset Resevoir and it is pretty solid.  My ultimate favorite thing about living in the Inner Sunset (and the Richmond District when I used to) is the access to the park. My wife and I took walks in the park almost every other night (mostly with a thermos of wine for her and a brown bag 22 for me). I've had birthdays in the park (slosh ball!!!) and we enjoyed being so close to be able to walk to Outside Lands when we got tickets. If you ever get tired of the park, the walk up to Turtle Hill is worth the view and Sutro Forest is pretty awesome. Also the beach is just an N ride or a 40 block walk away.  I'm really jealous you are just beginning your time in my old hood. Don't take it for granted, and try to spend a weekend or two just milling around through the neighborhood. Your friends will make fun of you for hanging out ""so far away from the city,"" but what they don't know is that you live in the real center of the city.   Edit because I got so nostalgic I forgot your questions: commute is 30 minutes on the N from 9th and Irving on a good day with no problems, but be prepared for all types of problems on Muni. There are alternative options like going down to Lincoln and catching the 7R or L (35-40 min, used to be the 71), catching the 6 on 9th and Judah (40 min because of all the stops and if you are closer to Embarcadero it could take longer), or taking the 43 or 44 back to Forest Hill station and hopping on any of the downtown trains (25-45 depending on making connections). This is getting ridiculously long so just DM me if you need anything else."

You'll might want to take the rapid services, which means waking up earlier. 40 mins vs 1 hr.  I don't know why /u/wellvis thinks SOMA isn't a good choice, it's not unsafe, and it's well within any commuting to downtown. Public transport to other areas are rather convenient too."
AskSF,3bj8m4,iamawong,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was a good choice based on the information she initially provided. I think parts of SOMA are less safe than others, but she'll have to see for herself."
AskSF,3bj8m4,wellvis,2,Mon Jun 29 19:51:37 2015 UTC,"You've read the moving to SF discussions, right?  And searched for similar, newer topics?  Although craiglist is your best resource, there are other ways to find an apartment.  You could even find the neighborhood you want and wander, just looking for places that aren't advertised online.    If you're sharing with roommates, $1500 is definitely possible, but you may have to look for a while.  I would say SOMA isn't as good a neighborhood as others for you specifically, but it depends where in SOMA you'd be.  Try Noe Valley, Glen Park, the Mission, or Bernal Heights, for example.  Good luck!"
AskSF,3bj8m4,wellvis,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"I missed the SF discussions thread, that one is super helpful - thank you for sharing!  After a quick look through the recent moving threads, they seemed to be mainly focused on neighborhoods and less on commuting to Palo Alto/budgeting, so I thought that I'd make a new thread. Hopefully this isn't too redundant and thanks for the response!"
AskSF,3bj8m4,wellvis,4,Mon Jun 29 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"You might try asking in /r/bayarea as well, as Palo Alto isn't SF.  I hope your employer has a shuttle running from SF to PA; otherwise, I would resign yourself to heavy traffic."
AskSF,3bj8m4,wellvis,0,Mon Jun 29 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Good idea. Luckily we get caltrain passes provided as the office is right next to one of the Palo Alto stations, so I'm not planning on needing a car out there!"
AskSF,3bj8m4,gassy_broccoli_fart,3,Mon Jun 29 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"Given that, parts of SOMA may be a very good choice for you.  You'll see when you get out here whether or not you like it."
AskSF,3bj8m4,come-back-kid,2,Mon Jun 29 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd look in SoMa and Dogpatch (or east side of Portrero Hill) so you can walk to the Caltrain station.  Commuting via Caltrain is certainly doable from other neighborhoods, but every mile out will significantly increase your commute time simply getting to/from the Caltrain station.  $1,500 isn't unheard of, but pretty rare these days.  $1,800 is a decent bit more realistic."
AskSF,3bj8m4,come-back-kid,2,Mon Jun 29 22:52:22 2015 UTC,"I commute too. I live in the Sunset, which I would recommend. Cheap, safe, quiet, good food. Honestly, neighborhoods are all distinct but I live in the Sunset, and am in the Mission every weekend. SF is so small that getting around really isn't that difficult. I would recommend $$ be your guiding/deciding factor.   As far as apts, I would say CL is your best bet. There are other sites, but CL is the best. I recommend also posting in the Housing Wanted section, so people can contact you. $1500 is definitely NOT unreasonable. No matter your budget, searching for housing is going to be a bitch, so STAY ON IT for a few weeks. I recommend lining up some things to look at right when you get here.   Good luck!"

AskSF,3bj8m4,shempmalone,3,Mon Jun 29 19:05:14 2015 UTC,"I would start looking now. Postings will say looking for someone to move in x date, so hit up all the ones that say 8/1. Never too early! Also good to just get familiar with the process. Also, I recommend sending your FB or LinkedIn profile so they know you're real. Watch out for scams!"
AskSF,3bj8m4,bgeeky,3,Mon Jun 29 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"You may have to book something temporary like AirBnb for a week or two.  A lot of people on Craigslist will cut off contact as soon as they find out you're not in town and available to meet within a few days.  It's not necessarily right, but SF is highly desirable and every apartment listing will have dozens of interested parties, so people are pretty quick to 'filter out' potentials that seem more likely to fall through or are more risky.  I say this from experience... it's rough."
AskSF,3bj8m4,imthewalrus06,2,Mon Jun 29 22:58:34 2015 UTC,"The area right near the Caltrain station in SOMA is fairly nice, and reasonably lively and getting livelier. Lots of restaurants, bars, and so forth; good weather; walkable supermarkets; easy to walk downtown / waterfront / etc. You'll probably go out more in the Mission or Marina or whatever, depending on your preferences, but you'll never need to leave the area, and will rarely need a car. For $1,800 in that area you can get a really nice share in a nice building, or a kinda crappy studio in a kinda crappy building if you're lucky."

Sort of hard to find and with only a few tourists about. You can get some great shots of the downtown skyscrapers at this little park.   Japantown seems to be overlooked by tourists. It is basically just three interconnected shopping malls but I preferred the shopping there to Chinatown, which sells ""Made in China"" crap.  Lombard Street was absolutely swarming with tourists to the point where everyone was getting into each other's way."

It's close enough to a Bart station you could drive your car down there and take BART Into SF if you don't want to drive in each day.   If you want to Rambo camp Golden Gate park or Lands end would be a good choice. By Rambo camp I mean pull out your air mattered and sleeping bag and set it up just before sunset and pack it all up just after sunrise. You won't be able to have a fire or set up a stove or store your stuff. Also it isnt legal and you might get harassed by the police.   The campsites mentioned below you won't be able to get into. The ones in GGRA are backpacking sites. The one on GG park is a group site booked months in advance.  One of the best places to camp is in Angel Island. You might be able to secure a weekday reservation. It's not very convenient tourist wise. Once you get out to the island your stuck.

Keep it bookmarked on your phone so you can check for delays, sometimes shit happens.  I'd skip the bike on any day with a parade or festival, there's going to be a million people on the trains and out on the streets.  No need for it really once you get to the city, all the events will be really close to public transit.   how long would it take to get to the civic center from there?    About 30~35 minutes from Millbrae to Civic Center station, depending on how long it stops at SFO to pick up airport passengers.  Civic Center station will be right where all the action is - you can't miss it.   how early should I arrive (i.e.: is it usually so packed that you can't get on for a few rounds)?   Millbrae is the first stop, so this won't be a problem.  Also when it's time to return, less people go to the Peninsula than the East Bay, so it's usually not a problem either.  I hardly ever see trains heading towards Millbrae packed like  the East Bay ones.  If you prefer to drive less, you can also drive to a Caltrain station but that won't get you as close to the action, and it runs much less frequently so sometimes it's a hassle.  Also, get a Clippercard at a Walgreens and load $20-30 on it!  That way you don't have to fumble around with ticket machines, and it works on all major transit systems.  Enjoy and stay safe!!!"

AskSF,3b48zk,Barcade,5,Fri Jun 26 03:01:33 2015 UTC,"you still have tenants rights even on a month to month lease. What those rights are varies from city to city.   Under section 37.9(a) of the SF Rent Ordinance, landlords who own rent-controlled apartments must have just cause (see below under ""just cause"") to evict tenants from those  units. Those reasons listed below are the only reasons landlords can evict tenants from rent-controlled apartments in San Francisco."
AskSF,3b48zk,klafka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"It's San Francisco...leases don't matter here like they do in many other areas due to tenants rights, rent control, etc.    In the past I've had friends new to the area tell me they are about to renew their lease with their landlord since their 1 year lease is up and I freak out on them and tell them ""no no no no no no"".  That's the exact opposite of what you want to do in this city.    Other things that you should look up and be knowledgable about would potentially be an owner move in. Owners are allowed to evict one unit in a multiple unit building if they intend to live in the unit (assuming the tenant isn't of a protected status...elderly, handicapped, have a kid in school, etc.).    In addition look into the Ellis Act which could screw you.  This is what the Mission's favorite villain, Jack Halprin, is using to evict tenants from a building he bought."

I wouldn't be able to narrow down the best, but NOPA is good and pretty massive. Very meaty. Other places you cant go wrong is 4505 Meats, Serpentine, and Marlowe. But for cheap and good and sorta fast food-ish, cant go wrong with In & Out and Super Duper.   The Presidio is a big patch of nature where you will get many great photographs. There you will find old federal officer buildings, veterans cemetery, Fort Mason, Crissy Fields, and a striking view of the GGB, which is worth walking over."

They were fantastic! Although it seemed like a bargain for $20.00, the food and drinks were extra. And although you use your credit card to make a reservation online, they don't actually charge your card. They will ask you for the $20.00 at the door.   You could go to SFJAZZ but good seats are expensive."
AskSF,3b2p35,webauteur,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"NOPA is a fantastic restaurant and the rest of their menu is always so good I can never justify ordering the burger there. 4505 BBQ, basically across the street, makes one hell of a burger, though  Best coffee in town is most of it. We have great coffee here. My favorite shops are Mazarine @ Kearny & Market (get a pour over) and Ritual (any location, almond latte... mmmm)   San Bruno is a mountain but not super mountainy. If you're going to Muir, drive up Mt Tamalpias via hwy 1, Fairfax/bolinas road, and ridgecrest. Will add 2 hours to your drive (definitely drive to Muir woods) but will be spectacular. The drive is amazing, especially if you're from Florida, and the view on a clear day is unreal  Alcatraz is cool but not worth it if you only have a short time in SF. There's so much city to explore and equally good views all around.   If you're serious about bikes, skip the in park rentals and rent a real road bike from Sports Basement in the presidio or a fixed gear from mission bicycle."

You might want to check out North Beach and the City Lights Bookstore if you are familiar with San Francisco's literary history. There is also a Beat Museum.   San Francisco also has a Japantown. It is mostly just a few interconnected shopping malls, but I liked it better than Chinatown because the shopping was better. I bought a samurai movie on DVD and a book on Japanese History. I also located a few Zen centers and temples.  I also explored the theater district and the South of Market tech office buildings due to my special interests.   For nightlife, I attended a show at Biscuits and Blues. I saw the Daniel Castro Band. They were great and this really made my trip special. It was more expensive than expected because the $20 is just for the show. Food and drinks were extra. I also attended a play, Pillowman, at the Exit Theatre, an exceedingly grim play about child murder, very dark. The Exit Theatre is in the Tenderloin so it wasn't a good place to be after dark."
AskSF,3axalt,zoemadigan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:35:35 2015 UTC,I liked their music so much that I bought a CD after the show. And I don't really listen to Blues so it was a new type of music for me.
AskSF,3axalt,Mdizzle29,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"Friday: go to the Mission! You'll be in the very touristy areas on Sat/Sun, it's worth checking out all the more indie/local restaurants/shops/stores. I would recommend starting at 16th and Valencia and walking South through the neighborhood. Some cool spots to check out: Clarion Alley of Street Art Murals between 17th/18th and Valencia/Mission Streets, The Parklets (mini parks along the way), and the quirky shops like Paxton Gate (a very SF kind of place). If you're in the mood for burritos, check out El Farolito on 24th and Mission. It is worth waiting on line. Get the ""Super Burrito"" with any meat of your choosing. 22nd street is also an awesome spot with a lot of room to hang out and bunch of cool indie vibes. If you're lucky you can catch some live music at Revolution Cafe or Make Out Room, check out the piñata-laden dive bar with a good beer selection at Latin America club, a scoop of frozen custard, and check out the Parklet on 22nd between Valencia and Guerrero. If you would like to go to a bar with a view, El Techo on Mission @21st has an incredible view of the city and very nice cocktails. Feel free to reply with any questions if you're in the mood to check out ""The Mission District!"" I am happy to help you plan and find cool spots!"

Admin jobs are a dime a dozen here or anywhere, so you can find a job quick. Maybe look into Exec Asst jobs which pay more in the administrative sector.   Japan ain't cheap either so perhaps you won't get such sticker shock when you see how much things cost around here. Bars, food, entertainment can all be found on the cheap too.

Maybe they can get a POD sent to one of POD's local storage facilities and then have the stuff picked up from a local mover there?  I've never done a long distance move like that, but I would assume that the main benefit of door to door service is that any kind of claims processes on lost/damaged items is less complicated when you only have one company touching your stuff, even if they contract out trip legs to 3rd parties.  When you hire multiple companies yourself to handle multiple legs and something gets broken, it simultaneously was ""like that when we got it"" and ""fine when we dropped it off."""

I haven't had to use it myself, but I also broke my ankle a few months ago and can totally empathize.  Crutches are just the worst.  You'd think they would help you get around easier, but they're their own headache.  Due to the nature of my work, I had to take time off on disability because of it, so I didn't have to worry about getting to and from work every day at least.  But my doctor was four blocks straight uphill from me and I had to take an uber to and from doctor's appointments until I could get into a walking boot.  That was like four weeks after the injury.  And even then, I still took a car to get uphill and walked downhill for another month.  Dealing with groceries and stuff was a huge source of anxiety, too.  I hope you figure something out.

Though you will see some sketchy-ass shit during your visit, your actual chance of being harmed is very low. In fact, depending on where you are coming from, it might be more dangerous for you to stay at home!  In a list of the 100 most dangerous cities in America with 25,000 or more people, based on the number of violent crimes per 1,000 residents, San Francisco doesn't even show up in the top 100 (though some surrounding cities such as Oakland, do). Violent crimes include murder, rape, armed robbery, and aggravated assault. Data used for this research are 1) the number of violent crimes reported to the FBI to have occurred in each city, and 2) the population of each city.   Property theft crimes are really high in SF right now, however - don't leave anything valuable in plain site in cars, and be careful using phones or cameras in particularly sketchy areas (though in the vast majority of the city you'll be fine).

AskSF,3ar2ex,urban_,-1,Tue Jun 23 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"Not the best. I don't know what the current deal/promo is now but you get 1GB of LTE per month, which is fast and super convenient. After you use that amount of LTE data, they downgrade you to 4G which to many apps is pointless, such as FB, Instagram, and just websites in general. Content won't load for several minutes.   1GB of LTE data goes faster than you think, but if you have wifi majority of the day you can make it through the month. Lately I have found myself asking bars, cafes, commercial businesses for their wifi PW just to conserve on data usage. Kinda lame.  And sometimes you just drop to 4G because of high buildings or you're in a parking garage or you're in a woody area (GGP). Once you hit 4G, you won't even be able to send photos via messenger.  All in all, it's fine for light usage, but if you love to stream Pandora/Spotify, you won't last long on high speed."

AskSF,3apebu,Not_A_Meme,2,Mon Jun 22 15:55:50 2015 UTC,yep. Granted it was for the 1st pre season game they held but still.  It was over an hour on caltrain then we had to transfer to VTA and sit on that train for at least 30 minutes.   We missed the first transfer because it was 100% packed so we had to wait for another train.  Maybe they changed it up because it was very stupid how the VTA train made all local stops to the stadium despite 100% of the train going directly from the Caltrain stop to Levis.
AskSF,3apebu,UnkleRuckus420,2,Mon Jun 22 16:00:35 2015 UTC,I went to Wrestlemania and had the same experience.

We actually had an easy transfer from Caltrain to VTA but making every stop when not a single person was getting on or off at all of the local stops sucked.

During the early part of that period until the 1880s, San Francisco was very much a was a frontier and unsafe in the ways frontier towns without solid, established law enforcement can be, but there were golden opportunities.  Lots of gold prospectors with lots of money to spend in San Francisco.  Do you know what your ancestor did for a living?  I assume this was a man who moved his wife and 3 children to the city proper in 1879?  Edit: 1949=1849"

I don't know how specialized he was - if that was a very skilled job, he might have been recruited.  I'll look into the book you mentioned - thanks!  I only know of Hollywood movies, like ""San Francisco"" with Clark Gable.  But while parts of that movie made SF look wild, they all wore suits and seemed pretty civilized (and that movie was about 1906).  It seems like you'd have to be a pioneer to deal with the lawlessness, and while entire families did pack up their stuff in those Conestoga wagons, it seems like those were earlier times than 1880, and the people more desperate (I'm still trying to figure out if something negative was happening in Fort Wayne to push him, rather than something in SF that attracted him).  I figured I'd ask the experts on Reddit to see if something obvious was attracting a lot of people in SF, though.  Edit: I just read the Amazon description of the book you mentioned, and it talks about that single district.  Lots of cities have ""Red Light"" and/or ""Crime"" districts.  What I really wanted to know was whether SF as a whole was lawless or not."
AskSF,3ao14i,wellvis,3,Tue Jun 23 01:36:47 2015 UTC,M. Louisa Locke has written a series of Victorian mysteries set in San Francisco in the 1880s.  Her blog has a good set of historical background articles that may be helpful.
AskSF,3ao14i,owlmonkey,6,Mon Jun 22 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"One way to research this some yourself would be to read the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper in that era. You can find them online for a fee at Newspapers.com, and they have them scanned back to 1865. Some other papers like the SF Call don't go back that far but nearly to 1890. For example, I just read a column about the ""Italian Opera Company"" visiting SF in the 1 June 1879 Sunday issue of the Chronicle. Don Giovanni was a culminating success, but the paper felt that Carmen should have been included in that cycle. So there was some kind of culture occurring there at the time at least."

I mean, there were ads for flats and apartments for rent, and the front page was mostly political stuff like you'd read today.  Unfortunately, the paper was on microfiche and at the library (poor visual quality, not available online), so I only read about one month's worth of stuff.  One reason I didn't pursue the paper, though, is that papers (and TV/radio today) often overstate or understate stories depending on the whims of the editors.  I was hoping for more of a historical perspective.  I did get several book titles - I'll look into those."

It's a tiny hole in the wall and there are like a total of 8 seats. I've lived like 2 blocks away for more than a year and every time I try to go I encounter too long of a wait and just end up going somewhere else. If you really wanna go you have two options: go a little before five or four when it opens and you can be the first seated or if you are lucky and your by yourself you might find a spot at the bar  Shanghai dumpling king: If you make it to the west part of the city or you are in the mood to stuff your face with amazing Dumplings and dim sum  for like no money go to this place. Get the green onion pancake and the garlic string/green beans as well as the Shanghai dumplings and the shrimp dumpling a little Money goes a long fucking way here  I know you think you know what Tex mex is or some bullshit but LISTEN TO ME: you don't know shit about burritos. Burritos are a fucking staple of the San Franciscan diet and you have never had anything like it anywhere else. Even the burritos in Mexico are not as good as the ones here.   If you come across any taqueria in the city get a SUPER BURRITO with carnitas or al pastor. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise cause obviously they don't know shit.  Close to soma: taqueria cancun on 6th and market is the best one close to you  El farolito on 24th and mission is hands down my favorite burrito in the city.

Bart trains don't run past midnight for the most part, but you can always split and uber with your group from the east bay to SF. I've done ubers from Berkeley to SF, and it's never cost me more than 35$ (and that's by myself). If your group split the cost, it would come out to just over the cost of a one way Bart ride.

The market is extremely high and competitive. I have friends and family who are in the market for a home and even bidding 30-50k above asking price with cash offers would not be able to get them a home. I would rent first and get the lay of the land before even considering buying.   If the job is in San Leandro, you have many apartment, townhouse and house options in San Leandro. If you want to commute, there are options in nearby Oakland that is revitalizing but I usually still would avoid that part of Oakland for now. I grew up in Oakland before buying my home in San Lorenzo and I tend to avoid if I have the option which sounds like you do for the job you are getting. The more East of Oakland you get, the worse it gets.  Alameda (Bay Farm) area might be an great option because you can take Otis to Dolittle street to San Leandro. Your next option would be the unincorporate town of San Lorenzo which borders Castro Valley, Hayward and San Leandro off the Washington Ave/ Lewelling BLVD 880 exit.  Castro Valley and their hill area is consider a very nice area and a great option to rise a family in.  Hayward is another option with a lot of potential rentals and houses to buy but there are parts of Hayward I would avoid like downtown Hayward.  I'd say if you are going for a nicer neighborhood, I would rank it this way.  Alameda/Bay Farm, Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, San Leandro - Washington Manor area, Hayward.  Anywhere further just means more commuting.  If it is a 9-5 type job, be prepared to be in traffic if you decide to live further away."

AskSF,3aj6a2,coppersense,2,Sat Jun 20 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid your budget of $60/n is too low for the area to find anything decent. Even far from thirty minutes. You might need to reconsider your travel plans, or stay at a hostel."

AskSF,3ah5t6,lookingforhouse,3,Sat Jun 20 07:09:52 2015 UTC,"I live on Twin Peaks and love it. I look out over the Mission and can see Alameda, planes landing at the Oakland airport, Mt Diablo, and everything in between. Yes it's windy, yes it's foggy, but occasionally I'll wake up and be just above the fog line which is incredible. Like a sea of marshmallow clouds below me and blue skies above. Totally worth it. I've never had an issue with mildew although I've only been up here for 6 months. It's almost like you don't even live in the city. It's quiet. I wake up and open the door to my balcony and hear birds. No traffic noise (aside from the occasional honk). There's always street parking pretty close by, and my apt came with a parking spot. I take the 37 bus to Castro (~10 min) and then take the underground to Montgomery (~15 min) so it's usually about 30 min for me to get to work in the Financial District. If for some reason I miss the bus coming home, then yes it's a hell of a walk uphill. And there's no other bus up here, just the 37. I drive to get groceries and take ubers to go see friends in the city. But I still love it up here"

Every time I've been around there I've been uncomfortably sketched out and I'm 32 and can handle myself, or so I'd like to think.  That surface street stop on Van Ness and Market just sucks for its loonies, and it's worse going east--Larkin is a skid row gauntlet, probably the worst block I've ever been down in SF.

You will see a lot of unsavory things and there are sketchy folks but if you mind your own business and follow basic street smarts (be alert, don't be waving your new iphone around), you should be fine. Walking around by myself in the daytime is fine. I don't walk around at night alone. Uber is there for that reason. It does get very loud at night sometimes. If you are a very sensitive guy, it might be wise to go to the sunset or richmond. However!

How much are you planning on paying for parking? There isn't ""free"" city parking. You can find rates around $20 a day. There are a few options.  Hotels near the airport - They often offer a daily parking rate and may provide a shuttle to the airport where you can pickup the BART.   Airport parking - If on the Oakland side, it's much cheaper. SFO is around $20/day. You can pick up the BART from either location to get into the city.  Craigslist - some people rent out parking spots. I do, but I'm not in the city. I'm close, but not in it. You'd need to use Uber/Lyft to get to the BART or directly to the city if you went through me. If interested, PM me. Other people may offer something similar.

AskSF,3aehip,DerLuftwaffe,2,Fri Jun 19 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Super Duper is a must-try.  If you happen to be hungry and there's one nearby (and there's a fair number of them here), it's worth a shot, but no need to go out of your way for it.    Not sure Za pizza needs to be there, either.  To be honest, I've never been to Za and that place has its fans for sure, but for instance Una Pizza Napoletana is run by the guy who was once unequivocably the best pizzaiolo in NYC before he packed up and moved here.  And some consider Tony's Pizza Napoletana to be even better than that.  La Nebbia is also a great bet, and is family-friendly (but a little out of the way).    Unless you're using some sort of credit card concierge service, State Bird Reservations is a great hassle to get a table at; it's one of the hardest tables to score in SF.  You'll either have to wake up in the wee hours and time your OpenTable reservation, or stand in line for an hour or so.    I'm guessing you have small children, so you may want to consider the California Academy of Sciences.  A big fun museum, and it gives you a reason to be in Golden Gate Park.    Your list is also very Wharf-heavy; except maybe for the sea lions and Alcatraz, this is mostly a tourist-trap area, the SF equivalent of Times Square or the Navy Pier.  Go to Alcatraz, perhaps have some Codmother food, then depart as quickly as you can."

Check out the Pirate Supply Store instead, its very family friendly. Walk from there to Paxon's Gate for a more true SF experience.  Yes, Burma Superstar can have a line. Go early and it won't be too bad. I don't know how the lines are at Burma Love, but it's owned by the same people and has a much more beautiful interior.

No subway or anything but the bus system is decent. You can get around pretty well to all the tourist attractions though, that shouldn't be a problem.  I hope you guys enjoy the city! I'm sure it'll be a great few months full of fun experiences."
AskSF,3addsx,mattmaldo807,3,Fri Jun 19 07:25:28 2015 UTC,"And last but no least, what about the night life?   There are plenty of good places to party, but please keep in mind nightlife in SF is probably very tame compared to Brazil.  It's not really a party-hard city like Vegas, New Orleans, or NYC - alcohol can't be sold past 2AM so most places shut down at 1:30-2AM.  There are a handful of places that stay open past that (Monarch, Ruby Skye, Endup, F8, Temple, etc.) but they still won't sell you booze.  As far as price, the cheapest/diviest places you can get drink specials for $3-5.  Nicer places and clubs will probably be $8+ for beers or well drinks, $14+ for better cocktails."
AskSF,3addsx,gassy_broccoli_fart,2,Fri Jun 19 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"Which school will you be attending?  San Francisco is a very expensive city, one of the most expensive in the USA.  It's quite possible to eat out every lunch and dinner and spend a lot, but you can also have a slice of pizza, a burrito, or a sandwich and not spend very much.   Three months should be enough to get a good grasp of San Francisco.  Tourist attractions can cost anywhere from a lot to free.  Alcatraz tickets, for example, cost $30 USD and should be purchased far in advance.  It costs nothing to wander the streets and see what's out there.  There are more Brazilian restaurants here than one, but you're probably not here to eat Brazilian food, right?  You can use Yelp.com to get an idea of how many restaurants there are in the city and what people think of them.  Public transportation is better than most cities in the US. You can get around pretty easily using streetcars, buses and even cable cars.  Consider getting a Clipper Card for the time you're here.    Night life can be expensive, but there are happy hours (usually from 4:00 to 6:00 or even later) where both food and drinks are inexpensive.  I'd suggest getting a good guide book on San Francisco - there are hundreds of them.  Also check the FAQ and Archive to see what has been previously discussed and suggested.  Have a great time!"

There seem to be quite a few Brazilians in San Francisco, and for some reason, many of them run pizza restaurants (such as Mozzarella di Buffala in West Portal)."

Even if you aren’t cooking there are plenty of grocery stores that have pre-packaged sandwiches/salads/meals for well under $10.    As for drinking out at bars/pubs, most casual bars (the few that remain) will be about $5-$9 for a cocktail, or $4-7 for a beer.  Focus on places that don’t look trendy or fancy and you will save a lot of money, and in my opinion meet more interesting people.  You are going to have a great time!"

I've lived in my neighborhood for years so I know all the local shop owners, bartenders, restaurant owners, grocery checkers, longtime residents, etc....  I value being able to walk down my block and recognize my neighbors.  There is a sense of community that develops in a city that is pretty special and that's what keeps me in The City.  That said, I love that it's so easy to get out of the city and to the empty trails in the headlands and beyond.

Start with the most popular areas - North Beach, Mission, Marina, etc. and see what's interesting in those places.  West Portal has a lot of good to it, but it may be somewhat sleepy for a 23 year old.   The L-Taraval runs to downtown pretty regularly.

Land's End is a great easy hike that will have great views of Ocean Beach and GG Bridge. Bonus if you can find the labyrinth! If you want to see the redwoods you should head up north on the GG Bridge to Muir Woods. The entrance fee is $7, but well worth it in my opinion.  I'd say the neighborhood with the cheapest nightlife scene is probably the Mission. A bunch of bars/restaurants in the same area so you won't waste time traveling to different places. You can have a filling meal on the cheap at a taqueria (I'd recommend El Farolito, La Taqueria or Taqueria Cancun). One of my favorite dive bars there is Bender's on 19th & S Van Ness.

You can always head over to Hunan Cafe 2 afterwards for some pretty cheap, but really good Chinese food. My favorite thing to do is roam around Golden Gate Park and take random pathways to the many hidden meadows. Geary Boulevard/Clement Street are also close by Lands End/GGP and there are TONS of cheap restaurants. If you want a sandwich, try Lou's Cafe. If you want to try boba, go to Sharetea.  Dolores Park is reopening this week so you should probably check it out. There are plenty of cheap spots to eat in the Mission, but you should definitely get a burrito AND/OR a pupusa at La Santaneca in Bernal Heights, which is a little out of the way, but it's my favorite Salvadoran restaurant in the city. The Mission is probably the best for nightlife.   I'd say save one day to visit the touristy sites- Fisherman's Wharf, Coit Tower, Chinatown, Alcatraz, Union Square, Lombard Street, Alamo Square.   If you have time, check out Twin Peaks, Haight Street, Mt. Sutro, Crissy Field/Palace of Fine Arts, Muir Woods (across the GGB), Japantown, Green Apple Books, Ocean Beach (during the sunset).   Also, Stern Grove Festival is going on- free concerts every Sunday this summer. It's such a chill atmosphere, I highly recommend it even if it may not be music you're into.   Enjoy your time in SF! :)"
AskSF,3a60lf,supaspuds,6,Wed Jun 17 14:34:10 2015 UTC,"I think it depends. Do you have any significant expenses other than rent and such? Are you comfortable in a single bedroom apartment?   A 2 bedroom will cost you at least around $2.5k, probably more like $3k so up to half your salary could be going to rent alone.   I think it's doable but you should really compare the costs of living and think about what your lifestyle here would be like. Have a look at the price of a two bedroom apartment you'd like for starters.   Also are you moving here just for the job or do you like the area? Have you been here before?"
AskSF,3a60lf,bobobo1618,3,Wed Jun 17 14:50:12 2015 UTC,It's definitely do-able if you don't have other big expenses like bobobo suggests and don't have the expectation of renting a really nice place.  There's definitely decent $3k - $3.5k per month 2 bedrooms available in richmond and sunset.
AskSF,3a60lf,hobbnet,3,Wed Jun 17 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"sounds on point.    regarding that part of town, the irony of the sunset district is that it gets the least amount of sun, local joke.  the rule of thumb is that the fog can stop around 6th Ave.  it's summer now and the whole town is under fog but for most of the year the fog rolls in in the AM and creeps away towards the ocean, at least to 6th Ave.  those areas are the 'inner sunset' and 'inner Richmond' districts.  I live near GGPark and the Presidio, there's loads of great outdoor opportunities.  my wife's a runner, I'm a cyclist, having all those parks nearby (and quick bike access to Marin) has made a huge positive impact on our lives.  the Waze app is great for getting across town when the traffic is bad.  it's best to not drive at all if you can swing it.  it's not a big town and the infrastucture is leaning more and more towards a car free society."
AskSF,3a60lf,MaximumMinimal,2,Wed Jun 17 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"I know most of these relocation threads talk about cost and commute but I wasn't aware if you were informed about how SF public school enrollment works. Your daughter is probably going to enter Kindergarten in a year or two, so this should definitely be something on your radar. Unlike most areas in which children matriculate into a neighborhood school, SF public schools enroll on a lottery system. You do research and pick your top 7 schools and cross your fingers for the best. About 80% of people get a school on their list, but you could potentially get put into another school. That school could be really far or in a district that's rated more poorly.   It's just something to think about, especially if you want to want to factor private school into potential costs. Your commute might also get hit, since your child could go to a school in the Marina while you live in Richmond/Sunset and work in (for example) FiDi."

AskSF,3a1625,wellvis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:52:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! That sounds like my current commuting situation which makes it easy relating to.
AskSF,3a1625,wellvis,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:01:34 2015 UTC,That is much better than you're likely to get on Bart.  Driving to Millbrae is almost always faster than Bart to Millbrae for me.  Example:  Bart from SFO to Powell takes around 45-50 minutes if I recall correctly.  Off peak you can drive that it maybe 25 minutes.  Check google maps for the transit versus the driving time to get the best idea.
AskSF,3a1625,wellvis,2,Thu Jun 18 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"Why not live in San Bruno?  The Mills Park neighborhood was very nice, family oriented, close to the Bayhill shopping center and downtown.

Since your highest priority is a short commute, I'd look in the areas closest to your work.  Those are not areas that have as many recreational options as places nearer to Golden Gate Park, for example.  I mentioned the Gateway Apartments because I know they have tennis courts nearby.  The Marina may be another district that you'll find attractive, since it has a lot of recreational activities along the coastline.    It's a series of tradeoffs.

AskSF,39xnll,Technohazard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:23:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm sure most are the same as 4 years ago, but I've heard a lot about gentrifying neighborhoods and figured it was worth asking to gauge their state nowadays. Plus the rent numbers I see in there are worthless.  You're absolutely right, it is a series of tradeoffs. If we need to sacrifice a few hundred square feet or few hundred dollars a month to get what we want, we will need to."

AskSF,39xnll,paranoidtandroid,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into Hayes Valley? The neighborhood has apparently cleaned up a lot in recent years. The shops/restaurants area is still pretty small, but definitely growing. There is a lot of new construction going up in this area. Some brand new apartments are up for rent on Oak and Octavia. You can probably find something around 600-650 sq ft (or less) for $3,800.  Alamo Square is just a few blocks away from Hayes, and there is a small park with 2 tennis courts on Hayes and Laguna. Dolores Park is just a short bike ride away. There are still a few homeless people now and then but it's really not bad at all.  Parking is not great in this area, but there are neighborhood permits you can get to help alleviate this. Depending on where in Hayes, there are a couple of bus lines that take you all the way down Market, or there is a Muni stop on Van Ness that's a 10-15 minute walk."
AskSF,39xnll,moonbaloon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into Hayes Valley yet. Seems a bit pricey, but does have everything we would want: good weather, parks, a half hour bike ride to work. Parking isn't a big deal. We're used to using public transit for everything, and will likely store our car at a relative's outside of the city for when we need it. Thanks for the suggestion!"
AskSF,39xnll,yokumlarkspur,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"For your budget you could get a decently nice place in the Sunset or Richmond districts.  I live in the Richmond and I'm half a block from Golden Gate Park which is great.  It's also a quick drive/ride north over the Golden Gate Bridge where you can enjoy all the outdoor activities that Marin County has to offer.    It really just depends on what you want.  Would you prefer a nicer/larger place with a slightly longer commute or would you prefer a smaller/less nice place with a shorter commute?  ~$3k can definitely get you a decent 1 Bedroom in the Richmond though!    I believe bus rides from the middle of the Richmond to downtown take roughly 30 minutes and I'd guess a bike ride from the middle of the Richmond to downtown would take slightly longer depending on your proficiency and route that you decide to take.  Also, I'm not sure if anyone else mentioned this or if you realized it but there is no BART in the north bay so I don't think you'll be taking BART from your relative's place if they truly are in the north bay."
AskSF,39xnll,caitRgator,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"Ha, shows how much I know of the area. I'm taking the Union City BART, which is in the EAST bay, not north :P  30 minutes on the bus isn't bad. I love biking, even in cities, so a 45 minute bike ride wouldn't be a big deal (might even be preferable to the bus) when I'm feeling up for it. The only problem I would have with the Sunset and Richmond areas is the fog. Is it really as bad as they say, like some days you don't see the sun all day?"
AskSF,39xnll,caitRgator,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the weather is definitely worse out here but there are plenty of days in ALL of SF where it's foggy (although not with the crazy drought weather we've been having in very recent weather).    Living east definitely gets you better weather....SOMA/Potrero/Mission get great weather but those neighborhoods are less ideal to me personally for other reasons which include population density, neighborhood feel, price of apartments, etc.    Noe Valley is incredibly desirable these days because it has that neighborhood feel and it has the nicer weather but you definitely PAY for it...especially since it's a relatively easy commute to the peninsula (google, facebook, etc.) from that part of town.  If you can handle the slightly worse weather in Richmond/Sunset I'd say it's VERY worth it.  Especially since it's only a short drive to the North Bay where the weather is almost always nicer.  If you are working downtown during the day you'll get the nicer weather while you work and then by the time you get home it's typically dark or getting dark so the weather is less relevant anyways, right?  Thinking about it more I'd specifically tell you to consider the Inner Sunset.  I recently moved to a central part of the Richmond (from Pacific Heights) and I really like it so far."

AskSF,39uxwo,aisotton,9,Mon Jun 15 04:52:47 2015 UTC,"I do the commute most days of the week (live in SF and work in South Bay). I lived in Santa Clara for a few months before deciding that I'd much rather live in the city. For me the commute is worth it.   South Bay is pretty much dead after 10pm and there's not really much going on in terms of nightlife (with the exception of a few bars in Palo Alto and Santana Row). SF has a more active nightlife scene, good food and a lot more things to do in general (there are events going on every weekend in SF). South Bay doesn't have a city feel and is very suburban and family oriented. If you want a city lifestyle then you'll only get that in SF.   A lot of people will say that you can drive up to the city on the weekends and live in South Bay (where it's cheaper) but it's not easy. If you come up on the weekends then you either have to find a hotel or crash at somebody's place. Caltrain doesn't run after 12am. Doing stuff during the weekdays in the city is almost impossible while living in San Jose.   There are a few negatives of living in the city and working in South Bay. SF is more expensive (rent, groceries, gas, etc). It can be a pain to wake up earlier to catch a bus on time and depending on how big your company's shuttle program is you might be stuck in the city if you miss the bus. For me the commute is about 1hr 15min but can def be longer if there's traffic or raining. The longest commute I had was 2hr 30min when it was raining heavily last October/November. Also, if there are meetups/events you are trying to go in the city in the evening, those may not be feasible due to having to take a bus back.   Also, the tech bus program has been a controversial topic here with the rising rents and gentrification of the Mission. Not everyone in the city agrees with the bus program and be prepared to get some looks or comments directed your way if you tell them you ride the buses or while you're waiting for a bus in the morning.  Let me know if you have any other questions."
AskSF,39uxwo,techbus_throwaway,2,Mon Jun 15 02:59:29 2015 UTC,"This is a really great write-up.   To this I'll only add that the largest source of variance in your daily commute is going to be getting out of the city. I live close to the southern half of the city and my commute is never over an hour and fifteen, door-to-door but if your shuttle is going to meander thru the city, down Van Ness, then depending on the whims of the traffic gods you can have up to 45 min added on some days. Move to the city OP, it's definitely more fun."

Only you can really decide for yourself.  I lived in San Bruno for a long time before moving back into San Francisco.  The positive side for me was immediate access to everything just by stepping out my front door.  The negative side is living closely with everybody and all the associated issues (noise, filth, crime, etc.).  Only you can decide if it's worth it or not.   Consider how much you're paying for rent currently and see what you can afford in SF.   Do you mind foggy, cold weather? You'll certainly get more of that in SF than in SJ.  Good luck either way!"

I'm paying $70 a month, but I think I'm probably grandfathered in at a lower rate. They have locations around town, but I think you have to pay extra to be able to use more than one."

But, I hear they're great and I have full intention on attending a few soon. I'll report back when I actually try one.  Anyway. I joined FitnessSF earlier this year when they were doing some sort of onboarding special--basically, I got a discount on the ""new member"" fee and now I pay a flat $50/month for full access to all their gyms. The membership includes most of their classes, but there's some that you can pay a little extra for as well. I think you're probably closest to the Castro location, which I haven't been to, but I do go to the Mid Market location sometimes (it's across the street from the Twitter building) and they have this fancy yoga studio and a dedicated Spinning room and another one where they do stuff like Zumba. The Fillmore location also has a saltwater pool. The shower and locker rooms are always super clean, and they have towel service as well. Also a bunch of various other amenities, like shampoo and body wash and all that stuff too.  I don't think there's a benefit to me recommending you (for a while it was like, a water bottle or something dumb) so I know I sound like an infomercial but I just really really like this gym. I'm sure there's some political reason that I should hate it, but it's pretty great. They do a 3-day free pass like most other places, and they'll let you try out the classes with it too."

AT&T is your other option for unlocked phone GSM/LTE service. They have a retail store across the street from the T-mobile store at 3rd & Market. Generally, they are a little bit more expensive but have better coverage outside of cities (i.e. Yosemite or Big Sur).  If you're staying in relatively populated areas on your trip I would go with T-mobile. Both providers have a lot more stores around the city, but those two are really central, deal with a lot of tourists, and are easily accessed on foot or by public transportation."

AskSF,39njkc,johnjonah,3,Sat Jun 13 19:33:53 2015 UTC,http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hipster
AskSF,39njkc,AskSF,5,Sat Jun 13 00:49:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of hipster :      Hipsters are a subculture of men and women typically in their 20's and 30's that value independent thinking, counter-culture, progressive politics, an appreciation of art and indie-rock, creativity, intelligence, and witty banter. The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively.  Although ""hipsterism"" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs.  Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too ""edgy"" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer.  The ""effortless cool"" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.  Consequently many hipsters tend to have jobs in the music, art, and fashion industries.  It is a myth that most hipsters are unemployed and live off of their parent's trust funds.  Hipsters shun mainstream societal conventions that apply to dating preferences and traditional ""rules"" of physical attraction.  It is part of the hipster central dogma not to be influenced by mainsream advertising and media, which tends to only promote ethnocentric ideals of beauty.  The concepts of androgyny and feminism have influenced hipster culture, where hipster men are often as thin as the women they date. The muscular and athletic all-American male ideal is not seen as attractive by confident and culturally-empowered hipster women who instead view them as symbols of male oppression, sexism, and misogyny.  Likewise, culturally-vapid sorority-type girls with fake blond hair, overly tanned skin, and ""Britney Spears tube-tops"" are not seen as attractive by cultured hipster males who instead see them as symbols of female insecurity, low self-esteem, and lack of cultural intelligence and independent thinking.  Hipsters are also very racially open-minded, and the greatest number of interracial couples in any urban environment are typically found within the hipster subculture.  Although hipsters are technically conformists within their own subculture, in comparison to the much larger mainstream mass, they are pioneers and leaders of the latest cultural trends and ideals.  For example, the surge of jeans made to look old and worn (i.e. ""distressed""), that have become prevalent at stores such as The Gap, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Hollister, were originally paraded by hipsters who shopped in thrift stores years before such clothing items were mass produced and sold to the mainstream consumer.  The true irony here is that many of the detractors of hipster culture are in fact unknowingly following a path that hipsters have carved out years before them.  This phenomena also applies to music as well, as many bands have become successful and known to mainstream audiences only because hipsters first found and listened to them as early-adopters of new culture.  Once certain concepts of fashion and music have reached mainstream audiences, hipsters move on to something new and improved.  Because of the rise of various online photo-blog and social networking sites, insights into urban hipster culture is reaching sheltered suburban audiences at an exponential rate.  Cultural ""norms"" have been deconstructed by hipster culture as a whole. Hipsterism is often dismissed as just an image thing by some, but the culture as a whole is effecting changes in society, leading to feelings of insecurity and resentment in people who are no longer a part of the cultural ruling class. For example, a lot of anti-hipster sentiment evidently comes from culturally-clueless suburban frat boy types who feel that the more sensitive, intelligent, and culturally aware hipster ideal threatens their insecure sense of masculinity.  Anti-hipster sentiment often comes from people who simply can't keep up with social change and are envious of those who can.     A conversation outside a hipster bar in downtown NYC:  Frat Boy #1:  Dude, are you having any luck picking up     chicks in there?  Frat Boy #2:  Man...I haven't experienced anything like this before.  These chicks are totally rejecting me and going for all these hipster guys in tight pants and shaggy hair instead.  Frat Boy #1:  Maybe we should head back up to that bar in Murry Hill where you hooked up with that drunk b*tch from Alpha Sigma Phi last week?  Frat Boy #2:  Yeah...I don't think we have what it takes to compete with these guys in here.  These hipster chicks won't even give us the time of the day!    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

AskSF,39h2no,spartan210,7,Thu Jun 11 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'm currently an undergrad student at USF and am from San Francisco, so hopefully I can provide useful info. It's a small, clean, pretty campus. Classes sizes are typically 30-40 students, but a few can have over 100 students. The majority of the professors I've had are great. Since the class sizes are so small, they get to know your name and it's a more one-on-one experience, kind of like high school. They quickly reply to emails and are very accommodating and helpful to meet your needs so you can succeed in their class. This is from my experience and I do have friends who have had professors that aren't so great, but in general I do believe USF has very competent, caring/helpful professors. Typically the not so great teachers are those teaching CORE classes (ethics, philosophy, etc).   Most students are wealthy SoCal prep types who came to SF and decided they want to become hobos-hippies-hipsters, so they put on the cool clothes, talk that cool talk and start smoking those cool cigarettes. There's a huge uber-wealthy, international students' population. Still, it's a pretty diverse, friendly campus. However, it's very cliquey. If you don't make friends your first year, it will be kind of difficult to make friends later on. USF is basically high school in terms of student culture/life/attitude. Parties do not happen on campus, but rather off campus at students' apartments. Sorority life is not huge, but it has been growing. Sports are also not huge; basketball seems to be most-watched/cared about sport on campus.   San Francisco is a wonderful and beautiful city, although it has been getting shittier recently due to gentrification/housing crisis. Still, there are a tons of stuff to do all day, every day. No one hangs out on campus except to study/go to class. SF is also great for foodies which is good because the cafeteria is not the best. It might seem cool/good your first few weeks here, but you will tire of everything fast and since Freshman are required to have a meal plan you'll feel obligated to spend it.   Tips:  -Try not to take classes on Lone Mountain (Lomo). It's hell, even for people who are fit.   -Don't bring a car. MUNI is great and you'll get a MUNI pass so it's free.   -Find an on-campus job if you were offered work study.  -If you've previously taken a language in high school, try to test out of the language requirement.   -Balance your Major and Core requirements/semester. Don't take 4 Major classes at the same time.   -Clean up after yourself in the dorm bathrooms! They get gross and it's not pleasant. Also, the toilet paper really  sucks.   -Start looking at study abroad options.   -If you can, try to get a bunch of friends and rent an apartment together after your Freshman year. Odds are you won't be offered housing your Soph+ year and USF will not help you find an apartment. Some students are forced to leave USF because they couldn't find housing. Housing in San Francisco is terrible, terrible, terrible and very expensive, so start your search early. Expect to pay 900-1200/month for rent.   With all that being said, I do regret my decision to attend USF. I came because I love SF and got a generous financial aid package, but the student atmosphere/crowd doesn't match well with my personality, so I'm constantly annoyed by classmates. I grew up here, so maybe that's why I don't feel the need to go through some weird change and try to be cool and fit into that SF Mission hipster stereotype, but right now my focus is to enjoy studying abroad, which is why I decided not to transfer. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask."

I've noticed that USF has more of a focus on volunteering abroad than other colleges I've been at? No idea about the citywide rep, USF and UCSF are two of the bigger games in town but USF has recently had a huge marketing surge with posters and cute slogans all over the city.

AskSF,39hc3j,hamleteatsoatmeal,3,Thu Jun 11 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Given the amount of time you'd be here, I'd recommend against trying to visit Alcatraz.  You'd take up at least half a day with that visit, time that could be spent doing lots of other things.  Get a visitor's pass or just buy a ticket at any MUNI station.  A regular fare ($2.25) includes a 90 minute free transfer in any direction.  We have a number of previous suggestions, some covered in our FAQ and Archive, some in our Top Questions.    Cole Valley is a short walk away from the Haight-Ashbury district, which can be fun.  It's also a quick streetcar ride to the Inner Sunset (going west) or the Castro (going east).    The general touristy things take place in the northeast part of town - North Beach, Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39.  Here's one suggestion for an itinerary:   Take the N Judah streetcar inbound to the Embarcadero station.  Get out and walk to the Ferry Building Marketplace.   After visiting the Ferry Building, take the F line streetcar (one of the historic streetcars) along the Embarcadero.  Stop at the Exploratorium if that sounds interesting to you.  Otherwise continue north until the streetcar line ends in Fishermans Wharf. Walk west through FW to Ghirardelli Square.  Find the Buena Vista Cafe and have an Irish coffee. Take the cable car back into Union Square.  Spend some time shopping, then return to Cole Valley via the N-Judah streetcar.   The Fillmore Jazz Festival will be going on that weekend.  The Mission neighborhood is always fun to explore; try taking the J-Church streetcar from downtown to Dolores Park, then head east from there.  Have fun!"
AskSF,39hc3j,wellvis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"Since you're in Cole Valley please do try Zazie! Great lunch spot.  Another suggestion... the Marin County Fair, but that would easily wipe out 1-day in your short stay here.  I would highly suggest Sonoma. I think it's pretty unique to the Bay Area. That's a half day trip and wineries close around 5pm. Make this trip on the 3rd to avoid traffic on July 4th."

Be wary when dealing with police, all it wakes it one cop in a bad mood to disappear for a time.   Also, my stepdad who grew up in Chicago is fond of stating 'Chicago is colder than a well-diggers ass'. Naturally this leads me to believe Chicago has the highest number of employed well-diggers in the country. This also leads me to question my understanding of the planet. Heat is one of the limitations as to how deep we can drill with existing technology. The deepest borehole on earth, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, reached a temperature of 354 °F before calling it quits. I would expect it to get warmer the deeper you dig. Then we've got to figure the nature of working in a well would block wind-chill, and the reduced airflow of the confined space would have heating benefits similar to how an igloo works. I've never dug a well however, so I'll take him at his word that he's experienced the cold of a well-diggers ass."

Union Square  If you're in Union Square check out Golden Gate Tap Room. Many options on tap, large area with tons of tv screens, pool tables, shuffleboard, foosball, assorted arcade games. This option is only about a block off of Union Square, in terms of travel time this would offer some convenience.  While you're in this area, cross the street from the Golden Gate Tap Room and walk into the Sir Frances Drake. Take the elevator up to the penthouse bar The Starlight Room. It's a great view of Union Square / photo op, also the history of the bar is pretty interesting if you strike up conversation with staff.  Chinatown  You are going to be conveniently close to Chinatown as well. Would be worth the walk up to Li Po's Lounge. No pool tables and is not hitting the craft beers requirement, but dive bar it does well and their chinese mai-tai's are worth traveling for. A small scene in Big Trouble Little China was filmed here, also a pretty entertaining episode of Anthony Bourdain's The Layover came through here.   North Beach  Continue all the way through Chinatown and you'll wind up in North Beach. Northstar Cafe or Columbus Cafe are my first thoughts on dive bar with a pool table. I've dropped into both these locations and found conversational competition at their respective pool tables.   If you're a shark on the pooltable, you may get more value out of Hawaii West. My one visit here found staff to be super friendly, and promptly ask if I played. I have never been crushed so completely at 8-ball. I felt like a toddler going one-on-one against LeBron. Then I looked up and saw all the local tournament trophy's on the wall. There can be some competition here.   For additional beer options, Rogue Ale is conveniently close, also notable that La Trappe and Churchkey tend to have beer options I can't find anywhere else."

For good music there is the SFJAZZ Center or Biscuits and Blues. I booked a show at Biscuits and Blues today because it is close to my hotel.   I decided to say at the Hotel Mark Twain because it was the cheapest place I could find. It is not far from the Hallidie Plaza and the Visitor Center. If you wanted to stay in North Beach then Hotel Bohème might be good. I decided it was too expensive for what you get, a shabby little room. The Baldwin Hotel is close to Chinatown.

Remember that most parks and recreational areas are free, and we have a lot of those.  You can walk around the many neighborhoods and find lots to do.  Good luck!"
AskSF,392tzz,wellvis,3,Mon Jun 8 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hey! So I live in the east bay with my husband and there are quite a few apartment complexes in the Hayward/South Hayward area that would fall into an affordable range for you, if you didn't want a roommate.  Craigslist is always a great option or driving around and looking for rental signs in the house area of Downtown Hayward.  I have friends who pay 1500$ because they got lucky with a 3/2 house.  We pay 2050, but we have a roommate so it works out to being like 1400$ after that.   If you want message me and I can tell you more about the area.  OH! and the apartment we rent is right by BART so that is fairly convenient for travel, if you don't want to use a car."
AskSF,392tzz,kstinasunflower,2,Mon Jun 8 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"I've got public service salary, and have been living comfortably albeit modestly in a central location at SF.  It's not so hard if you're not the type to splurge on nightlife and restaurants daily.  I've managed to find an apartment that's sub-$1600, so that helps."
AskSF,392mst,mattschwabby,5,Mon Jun 8 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"That all depends on what you consider ""affordable"", how much/what kinds of crime you would like to avoid, and how you plan on commuting to Palo Alto. SOMA was historically warehouses and light industry, and now is home to freeways, big-box stores, lofts, and other things you'd expect from converted warehouses. It's definitely not as culturally dense as more residential neighborhoods. Depending on exactly where you are, some parts are grimier than others, but most of the crime is going to be things like car break-ins (which tbh is becoming a much bigger problem all over the city)."
AskSF,392mst,BaronVonFunke,3,Mon Jun 8 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Understand that a ""neighborhood"" here can be as small as a block or two."

If you want a studio or 1BR for $2000 you'd have to look outside the city. Oakland's the best combo of affordability and things to do but the commute to Palo Alto sucks.
AskSF,392mst,infix,2,Tue Jun 9 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"Use craigslist to find what's available in the city (or elsewhere) for what you want to pay.    For what it's worth, I like living in the West Portal area.  It's served by three different streetcar lines and a bunch of buses.  It takes about 30-40 minutes to get downtown (depending on where downtown you want to be). Downside is it's frequently foggy, but Karl the Fog is why our weather is so temperate.  I'd agree that you need to spend a bit of time here to figure out what fits your needs.  A sublet or AirBNB might be a good option."
AskSF,392mst,wellvis,2,Mon Jun 8 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Most neighborhoods in SF have lots of things to do and are walkable to other neighborhoods with more to do.  For 2K, you should be able to rent a nice room if you do a little bit of Craigslist sleuthing and contact a bunch of people.  Oakland is still more affordable than SF and commuting from Oakland is closer to downtown SF than much of SF proper, but the prices even in Oakland have gone up a lot in the past few years.

Blowouts are $45 and updos are $90.  As for makeup, try Benefit which is also close to Drybar and costs $50-60.     Keep in mind, makeup artists charge a lot for weddings because there's a higher expectation of how the bride looks in person and in pictures. They spend a lot of time on you compared to a your Benefit/Sephora/MAC makeup artist. However, if you're a low maintenance gal or just looking for a very basic look, you can't go wrong with going to the makeup counters or even learning to do it yourself. I went to Sephora for a makeover before my wedding to pick up some tips and had a ton of questions answered and was confident enough to do my own makeup.  FYI, for Sephora and MAC ""free"" makeovers, there's usually a minimum purchase of $50 or so involved."

AskSF,391r2z,TheAntiPedantic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:58:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.   Is the standard rush hour traffic going North on 280 in the AM? I would assume going that way back toward the city would be the worst of it.   Is it worth going back north to see that part of the PCH or should we just head south on 280 and cut over at Half Moon Bay?
AskSF,391r2z,TheAntiPedantic,3,Mon Jun 8 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"280 flows faster than 101 during almost any rush hour, but you have to get to 280 from the airport, which means taking 380, and that can take half an hour to go just a couple of miles sometimes, which is why I would use google maps to figure out what traffic is doing when I leave the airport.  As for PCH, I would just cut directly West and go south from Half Moon Bay.  The best views are South of the airport, I think, but someone may have more experience than me."

Leaving anytime after 10am will get you there via the freeways in 1.5 hours. If you do it in rush hour, either way you be adding another hour onto it.   If you take the one, head over to half moon bay and down from there...bear in mind that there can be fog at this time of year so you also be staring 15 feet in front of you for much of the ride."

The big investors that build the huge high-rise leased apartment buildings don't need a few thousand pre-lease $$ from you considering the size of the investment they're making to build a 20-floor building.  Smaller multi-units seem to be developed and then sold off as a single lot to prospective landlord management firms.  The reality also is if you're pre-leasing, say, 6 months ahead of occupancy - the landlord has no strong idea for what the market rate will be at that time and thus also needs to hedge against you signing a below-market deal  ADDED: I think the way your approach does work is if you can pull your contact network for folks potentially about to end their lease.  Have them suggest you as a new tenant at the point of giving notice, with the sell to the landlord of zero viewings and 100% continuous occupancy."

AskSF,38tnjc,jackielarson,13,Sat Jun 6 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a well known sentiment that San Francisco hates LA, but LA doesn't hate San Francisco in return. In fact, it's considered this fancy, artsy, cosmos of music, parties and sightseeing. This is probably why SF hates LA, because their people are always coming here to ride the cable cars, bang the human trafficking victims and puke on the sidewalks. When people of LA and SF think about each other it's as polar opposites, Gemini twins, SF considers itself the Dark, Cold, Brooding, Intellectual, Mysterious and Dignified one, while LA is the Warm, Sunny, Happy, Party kid that's always coming over for a visit to remind SF just how cool it could be if it only smiled more, while SF is thinking, I'd be smiling if you would get the fuck out.  I've lived between both cities most of my life and it's a definite schizophrenia, my friend once put it like this, and don't get me wrong I don't agree with it or even with anything I just wrote-- but it went like this, People in LA are disingenuous assholes, smiling in your face while stabbing you in the back, where as SF people are genuinely assholes, right to your face.  That said my personal opinion is that as a straight guy, I always get laid a lot more in LA. And I like really like sex, so that's nice for me. It used to be that I just didn't feel welcome here, because not Gay, but it really feels like this last time around moving to SF has been eye opening, like it's not really even SF anymore. It's so different and all the stuff I like it for seems to be gone to smaller cities like Portland, San Diego and Vancouver BC, and all that's left here is the name and a husk of what was once an awesome culture mecca that's now simply a place people come to get rich quick, and spend their lives indoor complaining on Reddit.

No way I could afford a home or afford to raise a family; unless I marry someone in tech (odds are worse than 1 to 10 against)   Friends circle rapidly evaporated. Two years and the few people I connected with have fled or will be. Most people I meet seem to be depressed, stressed out, insecure or angry. The women are bad but god the men are some of the most insecure aggressive douches.  Tired of being hated just for being in tech. Tired of really cool people not-in-tech forced out of the area. Good non-tech friends who are really cool and contribute to quality of life being forced out. How can I put a dollar value on that? Tired of seeing shit, homeless people and homeless people taking shits. Fed up of California hypocrisy. Where do my state tax dollars go? Why does one of the richest cities in the world so selfish? I can't connect with most techies. I am a pragmatist, most are idealistic who live in an intellectual bubble. It's just bad being straight and single guy not into hookups or poly.

AskSF,38tnjc,TheNumberOfTheBeast,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:08:50 2015 UTC,Wow. Thank you for the input. Yeah the city seems to be in a weird place right now. One thing that really sucks after the weather really is the homeless people or just sketch hanging out. I don't really mind hippie stuff but those crackheads need to leave and venture out someplace.
AskSF,38tnjc,ishbot,0,Sun Jun 7 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"I mean. LA people can be blatant as well but I know that SF people just like to do same thing as LA. For example, LA people may say I am going to get dressed nice because I want to look nice and it makes me feel good and sexy since I've lost weight on this juice cleanse etc. Or even to the point, I'm going to look my best because I haven't gotten laid in awhile and I wan to get laid after I get trashed at a club. While SF people try to show that they don't care about anything, but really they do care inside. From this point of view, I rather someone be more blatant as I see it as honest. I hate playing tip toe game here with some people here. It is just frustrating and can't really go from point A to point B, and sometimes it just gets weird. But I do think that LA people are more blatant and that's the culture of it. Perhaps due to entertainment area where these dreamers come and get toughened out, and those who leave just couldn't handle it maybe. Other reasons maybe why because LA is literally compromised of immigration neighborhoods so it can be seem off putting for those who are not used to first generation people who come to America for their own dreams which usually come with making lots of money to help their family back home. Perhaps more than so than the Chinese up here. Maybe telling people to lose weight because someone is fat is perhaps not a bad thing in my  honest opinion. Fat people do not want to stay fat, so why don't you tell them and motivate them rather than keep quiet and not let them know? In a way LA people can be pretentious with their fancy cars especially, but SF people can be just as pretentious in their own way to show they don't care about anything but deep inside they do."
AskSF,38tnjc,ishbot,2,Sun Jun 7 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really follow much of what you wrote, not sure why. But I think I was saying the opposite. People in SF view themselves as realer than LA. Not the other way around. I'm really only talking about attitudes of the cities towards each other and how people perceive them. The reality is that they're both more or less the same. Only geography is different. Like you need a wetsuit to go in the ocean here. You can't go two weeks without seeing the sun there. You've got fake people here, fake people there, yuppies here, yuppies there, anarchists here, anarchists there. The only significant difference is more entertainment industry there, more finance and tech here, but also there's really a lot of both in both places. And are we talking about comparing LA county or San Francisco county? Or the whole SoCal region to the whole Bay Area? They're really both the same to me and I'm living proof that lots of people live in between both cities and move back and forth quite a bit so attitudes about people are all summed up by your individual encounters. The car thing is real though. Lots of people won't even talk to you if you tell them you've lived in la for six years without a car, in fact that's where Turtle from entourage gets his name. Turtle is a person with no wheels there. Where as people don't even blink about it here, in fact they'll think better of you for not having one. I think as far as pretensiousness goes some people in SF think LA is showy and shallow, where there are certainly people in LA who think the same thing about SF, just depends on what demographics you're talking about. Nob Hill? Pac Heights? Marina? Hardly any of these places are filled with what anybody from Inglewood or Reseda would consider to be down to earth, or not caring about their status and image. SF is way more famous for dressing upscale, wearing suits etc. I don't know where you're hanging out.  Not to troll, but isn't it a little bit off topic and assumptive to say that fat people don't want to be fat? I know heavy people that like it just fine. Don't want to lose weight. Think it's sexy and even get laid plenty. You're not doing well for countering the stereotype that LA folks are shallow, vain and lacking intellectual depth. Lastly, telling a stranger they have a problem, especially in an unsupportive context is literally the worst thing you can do for them. It's not being honest, it's being judgmental, impolite and lacking compassion. You want to make somebody feel better don't be an ass, show them you care about them in other ways than just pointing out their absurdly obvious physical qualities, that's not going to help them, just make them think you're an idiot."

AskSF,38tnjc,orageslointains,3,Sun Jun 7 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Southern California and while I loved the outdoor activities and weather, I hated the suburban sprawl so I moved up here the first chance I got and I love SF. The weather certainly took some adjusting but I've actually grown to love it as well.   Public transportation actually exists here!! I mean, it certainly doesn't compare to public transport in other cities around the world but it is a million times better than anything in Southern California. Also, I can actually walk to places! There are so many awesome things I can do within a 15 minute walk of my apartment, instead of making getting into my car and sitting in traffic for 45 minutes to go like 5 miles.   Things are also so diverse and accessible here! I grew up in SD, where it isn't super diverse and that is definitely reflected in the food. Even in LA where it's super diverse, you have to drive across town to experience it. Here I can walk to Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Indian and Persian restaurants from my place.   Unfortunately it's so expensive I'll probably have to move soon but I love the Bay Area in general so much, I could never see myself moving back to Southern California."
AskSF,38tnjc,89SuperJ,0,Sun Jun 7 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Suburban sprawl can be annoying but some suburban areas are pretty nice especially where I come from in Orange County. But this is where I have a problem with the city. Don't you feel that you are sort of limiting yourself? It feels that I live in Disneyland of some sort sometimes. Yeah I can walk and try all these different foods but it's very limited in authenticity and usually is so changed to fit general American needs (White People), and I don't really like that. I really don't like going to asian restraunts and seeing bunch of Americans eating their thinking they are at a world class city that offer very authentic foreign cusines. No. SF may have better European food since they are influenced by those cultures: take a look at the houses. But LA is literally compromised of immigrants from so many counties mainly from Asia and I think their food is way more authentic than up here and usually come in more for your buck. LA traffic is hectic but OC traffic is not if you avoid early and five o clock traffic. LA traffic isn't bad as well it's jus that there are lots of accidents that hold. Give it a 5 years or less in Bay Area traffic, I'm pretty sure you will change your mind with these crazy amount of people coming to the Bay. The Bay Area traffic is number 2 worst traffic after LA fyi."
AskSF,38tnjc,ishbot,3,Sun Jun 7 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"The city is small but I never feel like I'm living in Disneyland. I feel like I go out and experience more things than I ever would in Southern California because it's so easy to get to them. Between walking, mini, biking, uber/lyft, the city is really easily accessible and my friends and I can all go out without having to rely on a designated driver and driving 30 minutes. I don't really experience a ton of traffic and BART goes all over the east bay. SO and I also do have a small car we keep that we use to go over to the East Bay all the time to visit his family.   As a Chinese person myself, it's never really bugged me to see Americans eating at Americanized places. There's a lot of authentic food to be found still actually, if you look in the right places. Also there are TONS of immigrants here! Especially if you are looking at the Bay Area as a whole, there are so many East Asian, South Asian, and Latin American immigrants everywhere! There's a ton of great Asian food down on the peninsula and Silicon Valley exactly for this reason. And in the East Bay in particular there are some pretty strong Nepalese and Cambodian communities, which I never experienced living in Southern California.   I truly despised living and growing up in Southern California so I doubt I will return. I mean, it's a nice place to vacation from time to time but it is just not at all for me and there is nothing I could do down there that I find that I can't do up here."

AskSF,38tnjc,roy_ayers,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"But saying that you don't need a car up here is crazy too. Bart is never connected to many places you want to go in the city, and the bus system isn't reliable either. It can be VERY SLOW with all these people now living in the city. Let alone, with exploring the Bay, you definitely need the car. I do think that LA food is way more authentic. There are way too many fusions to be counted up here. I feel like sort of going to Disneyland when I go to the city where they have a lot of variety of options but usually overpriced and made to fit general taste (White People? Lol) and usually swayed from authenticity. For example, Mission Chinese Food. Cherry Glazed Pork Ribs? Really?"
AskSF,38tnjc,zeonchar,7,Sun Jun 7 01:17:47 2015 UTC,"The example you picked is a bit silly. Mission Chinese Food was never meant to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant. The chef is a Korean American who was adopted by a white American family. He said he just wanted to open a restaurant where he could cook and serve the kind of food he would make on his days off. You don't go there to eat authentic, you just go to eat some fun yummy food.   There are tons of authentic Chinese places in SF, you just have to look."
AskSF,38tnjc,zeonchar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Thank you for correcting me. Do you have any recommendation as for Chinese food? And my point was that many of these restraints don't have competition to bring out the best of the best and many people do not experience that. If you want to eat amazing food, you have to go at least $20 starting dinner for a very little meal at some hip place, which is usually a fusion and all about presentation. I don't know. One thing that LA does better is Korean food and because of the competition, their food gets exceptionally better and not because they hire some crazy good chefs, but it's affordable and very good authentic cooking from immigrants. I do think the social gap is much bigger in SF than in LA, which is saddening."

Also, I'm not quite ready to find a neighborhood, etc yet, I'm more just looking to see if I would even enjoy living in SF at all."
AskSF,38p0qw,StoleMyHeart,2,Fri Jun 5 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"Because I'm procrastinating, I'm gonna answer your extensive questionnaire and hope it helps you.   *I currently work as an Economist for the federal government, and have a master's degree in public policy. How difficult would it be to find a career in these fields in SF? I know the bay area is extremely tech-heavy, but there must be other options? Does anyone have experience they can share about working in public policy/economics in the bay area?   I have the same background and qualifications as you, including a similar bachelor's and MPP degree. How odd is that?  In any case, I do have a good mid-level job but I'm not working for the private sector. I reckon you can try looking for federal government jobs here.  I'm not aware of any private sector job who would let us practice economics or public policy.  You may have to move out of your subject matter expertise and make a career shift to work in tech, which is the booming sector here. Something like business development?  I briefly contemplated joining the masses of tech workers, but I like my area of expertise too much.  I find that most private sector firms here don't know what to do with an economist who writes policy for a living.   *I subscribe to r/sanfrancisco and I feel like all of the articles I read are either about how insanely expensive the city is, how bad the drought is, and how terrible the homeless situation is. Are things really that bad? What are the reasons that people choose to live in SF?   It's not that bad.  I'm living pretty well with an 80k salary. Yes, the homeless situation is really terrible.  The city is still charming as heck, though, and I fall in love with this city the longer I stay in it even though it's a massive money suck.   *I know that SF is extremely expensive, and has the highest rent prices in the county. I have lived in both DC and NYC, and although they are both very expensive, they can be do-able. It sounds like SF is not even do-able unless you are making well above 6 figures/year. With my work experience and education, I would not be making peanuts, but I also would not be making a tech industry salary. Is it even worth it to move to such an expensive city?   See above.  SF is about as expensive as NYC, but with worse housing problems and steeper rent.   *What is day-to-day living in SF really like? How do you get around (car, bike, muni, BART)? What is the night-life like? Is it easy to make new friends and develop a community?   I walk to work or take Muni to work.  It's a small city, and everyone likes to walk.  There's something for everyone nightlife-wise, but I'm more of a pub-and-coffee shop person.  There's always something to do during weekends.  I like to wander around museums or try out new restaurants or just buy stuff at Bi-Rite (best ice cream ever).  Strangely enough, making new friends will take effort.  I find that the busier the city, the harder it is to connect (lesson learned from living in over 5 countries over the past 10 years).  Until now, I spend most of my social time with colleagues.  I do need to work on making more non-work friends, but eh.   *What is YOUR favorite part of living in San Francisco?   The weather is FANTASTIC.  Just the right kind of alternating cool and warm.  I do not miss those blasted -15C winters.  I also like the laid-back atmosphere and the fact that people here don't bother dressing up. Walking around in a power suit makes me stick out like a sore thumb."

AskSF,38p0qw,wedge713,2,Fri Jun 5 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure about jobs in that field, I would check Craigslist, Indeed, etc.  The drought doesn't actually affect your daily life as much as people make it seem. The city is expensive only for housing, everything else is pretty regular pricing. If you can find a good apartment with roommates, you will be lucky to pay $2,000/month. Depending on where you live, homeless can be a problem. There are literally homeless people who pitch a tent outside my front door. However, they aren't overly aggressive usually, just stay away from the Tenderloin if you are scared of homeless people. However, there are substantially more homeless people here than any other city.   *Is it worth it to move to San Francisco? Honestly, no. If I lived somewhere else, I wouldn't want to move here and pay market rate. The only reason I live here is because I grew up just across the Golden Gate and have rent control. If you aren't making at least $80,000, you won't have very much disposable income.  *Day to day living in the city is awesome. I ride my bike everywhere pretty much and it's easy. I wake up at 7:20 and I am showered and in the office by 8:00. Easy to make friends? Depends on how hard you try. There are a TON of transplants here, so a ton of people looking for friends.  *Favorite part of living in San Francisco is that there is always something going on. Street festivals, concerts, comedy shows, they all come through San Francisco, and usually I can walk or ride my bike to the venue.  Hope this was helpful!"

AskSF,38lf1f,bottlebrushtree,5,Fri Jun 5 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"industry titans like Twitter are paying millions in local taxes   Nope. Haven't you heard about the mid-market tax holiday Twitter enjoys?  For the record, I'm not opposed to that tax holiday; I think it was a correct and difficult decision and it is bearing good results for the neighborhood. I was very skeptical. The remaining question is the long-term impact and the rather bad precedent it sets.  To answer your general question, I'm certain city revenue isn't up nearly as much as you imagine. (I have no hard numbers to offer, I admit.) City revenues were hit hard, and all departments took a huge slash, in the down years. At present, department budgets are all up somewhat, but you wouldn't call it a windfall.  Tax revenues track a bit slower than you are imagining. Property values have skyrocketed, no one will debate that, but local govt only gets a share of the pie when the property changes hands -- the basic tenet of prop 13, as I'm sure we're all aware. Figure what, 1-2% at most, of SF properties change hands each year. So that's a minimum of 50 years by simple math for the city to experience a full turnover of property tax revenues. If ""city govt tax revenue"" were an investment vehicle, it would be a Dog as far as wall street is concerned.  Having said all that, yes, the city is enjoying budget surpluses at the moment, as far as I know. But again, this is in the context of a half-dozen or more down years preceding, so there's a certain amount of catch-up in terms of paying down debt, deferred maintenance, un-funded pension line items, etc."

I lived with two girls in a 3 bedroom after a breakup. Banging roof deck, charming apartment. Everyone in the building was friendly and I quickly made friends with the dudes on the first floor. Fast forward 3 years and my boyfriend and I moved into said dudes apartment when they moved out. I was in heaven!!  My best friends lives upstairs, it was like a quasi Seinfeld.   But then....oh yes.  Last year our electricity shorted out and our landlord didn't seem to care!  We called and texted him. He sent an entire family (grandparents, parents, aunties, uncles, children) to look at the electricity issue and they fought and argued. It was never fixed and it was apparent my once super sweet landlord was pretty much trying to evict us by refusing to fix the electricity.   I was devastated.  Like, I sought counseling on my next steps as it seemed I was priced out of SF.   Almost exactly a year ago we started looking, it wasn't pretty. Tiny shoe boxes for over our price point, seedy 2 bedrooms in Oakland. We came to an open house of an apartment that was nice, definitely nothing nicer in my price point, but still wasn't what I wanted. The landlord suggested we look at a similar unit on the top floor and HOLY SHIT. I thought he was fucking with us.  He's just bought the building and this particular unit hadn't been occupied in over 5 years. It was tore back, but has panoramic views from all windows on the GG bridge.   He remodeled it for us and we moved in a month later. He did new wood floors, beautiful tile in the bathroom, and mirrors closet doors. I cried when we signed the lease, I didn't think something so lucky could happen to us. We love the building even more than our last. Our landlord is responsive, loves our cat, and is super funny. The apartment itself works for us SO much more than our older charming mold infested electricity deficient apartment.   A few months ago, our landlord asked if someone from the bank could come see our unit. The bank guy was amazed at our place. I guess our landlord got a HUGE tax break for buying and remodeling the building and joined a program to provide affordable housing for SF tenants. We pay way way under market value for the place and the building is rent controlled.   The moral of this story is: is there a housing shortage?  Yes. Are there really great apartment for rent with cool landlords? Absolutely. Does it take time and patience to find them? FUCK yes.  We love our apartment because it's somewhere we can call home. It's not the fanciest, it's not in the trendiest neighborhood, but it's mine and it's safe."

AskSF,38idrt,geoff415,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"The way it works in SF is all apartments rent at the market rate at first, and then ones under rent control can only be raised 60% of the CPI-U (which amounts to about a 1% increase per year).  No one will advertise that the apartment is under rent control, but most of them that are built before 1979 are. So look at older buildings only basically. Check with the rent board about a specific address if need be.  You can always ask the landlord if it is, but I wouldn't advise that as it is a contentious topic obviously.  Edit: 60%"

There were a lot of those.   We made appointments to see a bunch of places and walked around viewing apartments. Most of them we ruled out for being too small/too rundown/too expensive for the condition, etc.   We found two we liked a lot, both about the same price. One had been completely remodeled and had a gorgeous brand new kitchen.  No pets allowed. The other was a kind of rundown place but with a cool older lady as the landlord. During our meeting with her she asked if we had pets. We said no, but we'd love to get a cat. She said, well, if you get a cat, you should get two so they'll have company.

If you are serious about finding a job, you should avoid using any illegal substances (even MJ) until you have a position, understand your company's policy, and are confident you won't be tested.  If you want to live in the bay on 55-60K you will need to have a roommate or two and probably need to be frugal in other ways as well.   If you want to live in SF, owning a car is a terrible hassle and not necessary. I can get almost anywhere on a combination of BART and Muni.

AskSF,38dc1c,emiterusaemskcolc,2,Thu Jun 4 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"AFAIK (at least at my company), service employees are actually subject to more rigorous policies because their jobs involve a lot more than sitting at a desk and typing.  This whole city is vibrant--it's just that different parts of the city vibrate in their own ways. Which neighborhood you should live in is a complicated and personal question. Most of my friends have lived in a few different areas of the city and took some time to identify with a specific neighborhood. Just starting off, I'd recommend trying to live within walking distance of one of the BART stations. Personally, I started off in South of Market (SoMa) because it's close to downtown and transit and my office is here. If you're an avid cyclist, you can get a lot of places via bike and that opens up your living options significantly.  For the charter bus commutes, they stop at various places throughout the city and drive direct to tech campuses. I think the trip normally takes about an hour or hour and a half.

AskSF,38dc1c,ivorjawa,5,Thu Jun 4 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"In general, if you are working in tech in Sillicon Valley, you are probably going to make more than 55-60K, even at an entry level position. The cost of living here is indeed extreme for anyone who has recently moved here (people who have been here for years have rent control), even in all the areas surrounding the city, especially if you don't have friends or connections to help you find an apartment (I know that sucks, but it's true). If you somehow find a reasonable apartment (<= $1500/month), and can avoid owning a car (which depends entirely on the job and apartment you find) and have decent benefits at your job, you can squeak by in SF on 60,000/yr, but that's about the minimum. But as I said, if you get a good job in tech, you'll make more than that in your first year.   As for your first question: generally, tech companies (at least Silicon Valley software and web service companies, if that's what you mean) do not bother with drug testing. Nor do electronics design or robotics companies, generally. If you have the skills they need, they couldn't care less if you're baked in front of your computer. However, if you're looking to do building engineering, or have anything to do with public transportation, infrastructure, or especially aircraft, they do drug test, repeatedly, per federal law."

In NYC there's those people who find apts for others, I can't remember their names (not realtors), whose sole job is to apt hunt/house people.  Does that sort of concept exist in SF?  Unfortunately, while I do know a few people in the area, they are all  (wealthy & older) homeowners, though I will certainly talk to some of them to see if they can help put me in touch with the right people.  Regarding your second point, it is what I expected (no drug testing), but what got me concerned is a few of the international companies I have talked to state on their corporate websites that by applying to the position they do drug screens/background checks.  Which is why I was curious if policies are slightly different in that Bay area for those specific locations.  Thanks, again."

My favorite seats that are usually in the $40 price range are the Lower Box Left Field, which sort of have a weird perspective (which is why they're cheaper) but really put you in the action and are more comfortable than the bleachers. If you're not a bleacher person and don't like the perspective of Lower Box Left Field, see if the View Box is available.  Be aware that for some games, $40 won't even get you into the stadium."

AskSF,38ajxu,Fat_Taiko,2,Tue Jun 2 23:34:14 2015 UTC,If it's a company with a location at the airport chances are you can return it there without any additional fee.  Usually the extra charges are based solely on where you pick it up.
AskSF,38ajxu,zonker77,4,Wed Jun 3 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"Cross-posted question, so cross-posting answer:  I don't think the shuttle service to the rental car place at the airport is a ""headache""; it's a train with plenty of space for luggage and ample accessibility. That being said, the airport location has high taxes and fees, including a $20 transportation fee.  Also, did you consider looking at places in between SFO and the city? I rent cars in and around San Francisco very frequently, because I don't own a car but like driving, and I've found the best deals are with Budget in San Bruno; prices in the city tend to not be the cheapest since there's huge demand there. The San Bruno Budget is maybe a three minute walk through a parking lot from the San Bruno BART station (which is just one stop from SFO). There are plenty of coupon codes available online so I usually pay less than $130 (taxes included) for a week's rental there. Most rental car companies have locations in San Bruno as well, although, as I said, I found Budget to be the cheapest, and also the easiest to access by public transit.  Also, with Budget at San Bruno, I've often been able to call a day or two before the end of the rental about returning the car at the airport instead, and they usually oblige without any additional charges."

AskSF,385jal,culdesaclamort,2,Tue Jun 2 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, it looks like the one in AT&T park is just a crab sandwich. A crab melt is an open-faced crab sandwich with cheese melted on top of it. It's pretty delightful. The one at the ballpark is crab with some butter on garlic bread. Still, well worth it!"
AskSF,385jal,johnjonah,4,Tue Jun 2 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Not really, in my opinion.  I mean it's better than most ballpark food (especially compared to the wretched options at O.co), but not better than, say, a good eatery outside the stadium."

If you lived north of the Golden Gate Bridge, you'd be paying a $6.00 or $7.00 entry fee daily. If you lived east of the Bay Bridge, your toll would be between $4.00 and $6.00 per day assuming normal commute hours.  There's no charge to get into the city from the south via automobile, so there's that.  You'd still be fighting traffic no matter which way you get here.  BART would be much more convenient if you're close to a BART station, but Caltrain might be a better option on the Peninsula, depending on where you live and where you're going in San Francisco."
AskSF,38466q,wellvis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"North and east you have bridges, which means tolls (see other comments), and a single point of failure when someone screws the pooch.

Napa will probably need a day instead of half.  These wine tours tend to be leisurely.  For SF, 2-3 days would suffice."
AskSF,382y0t,StoleMyHeart,2,Mon Jun 1 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"Having done that particular drive myself more than a few times, here's my recommendation for things to hit...  Oregon: Mt Hood, Tillamook (the cheese!), Salem, Bend, Bandon (my personal, all time favorite place in Oregon), Grants Pass, Klamath Falls,  California: Do yourself a favor and go south via Highway 96 - it's the scenic route, you'll pass through the Avenue of the Giants and it dumps you into Arcata (Humboldt county)  Past that you can stop in Fort Bragg/Mendocino (a must to see in that area is Glass Beach). Go through Ukiah and down 101 (skip 5) and you end up in Sonoma and it's a quick skip over to Napa. From there it's not far at all to SF.   if you don't go the scenic route, go through Mt Shasta>Sacramento>SF  two to three weeks is alright, I believe I calculated something similar once when I wanted to take someone along that drive (and not do it for family reasons). Pick out a few destination spots you really want to see/explore and give yourself an overnight or longer stay but you should have enough time. If you want, there's always Yosemite further to the west once you get past Sacramento."

AskSF,3822qj,TheAntiPedantic,3,Mon Jun 1 19:20:21 2015 UTC,For free check out Tunitas Creek.  It can get pretty windy down there but nothing beats opening your tent door in the morning to an ocean view. Disclaimer. You aren't really allowed to camp there but many people do including many homeless. They are harmless. The beach is big so you can find a spot where no one will bother you. Also it is a little bit of a hike to get down there and you might get a ticket if you leave your car on the highway overnight. You may need to park down the road a ways and walk back. Just look for the signs.  Other places on the peninsula to you might consider... Memorial Park Butano State Park  Places in the East Bay...  Chabot Lake Not a great campsite (i.e. Not very romantic) but they have showers and the location is great for being able to get to SF and the rest of the bay. This is where I would stay if I was from out of town. Drive down to the BART station in the AM and you can get around the bay fairly well to explore things. Or take your car if you want. Check the web site because the gate closes early. I forget when. If you come back late when the gate is closed you can park outside the gate and walk to your camp site.   There are a couple other east bay sites  but they are kind of far so I won't mention them.  In the North Bay...  Angel Island - This is romantic for sure but it is not a great spot to use as a base of operations as getting on and off the island takes a lot of time. Weekends are booked way in advance so you will probably have to go on a weekday.   Kirby Cove - This is the best spot in the world but getting a reservation is impossible. I won't link but if you google it you will see how awesome it is. I've only managed to get a res ONCE in 15 years of trying.

Relatively short drive over the GG bridge, Sausalito is beautiful, Muir woods, Mt Tam, all great suggestions. The road out to Stinson beach/Bolinas can get JAMMED with traffic on the weekend so you may want to avoid it if you actually want to get out of your car. Same thing with Napa/Sonoma... great places but you'll spend more time driving out and back then enjoying the sights. But you can get to the town of Sonoma pretty easily. which is great, as is the drive there. Guernville/Russian River area is amazing too.

It's no SF, of course, but it has a very nice, active downtown area, and if you get tired of the tony suburban vibes there, you're still not that far from the city. San Mateo and Millbrae can also be very fun; I recently went to Orange County and Costa Mesa really reminded me of San Mateo if that gives you any idea.  Also, a warning about Daly City - in addition to not having much going on, they unfortunately get most of SF's bad weather - you know, the days when it's cold and foggy there but totally clear and mild in the rest of the bay?

It's effin terrible and getting worse. Only on weekend mornings does the ride take the time it should: roughly 30-40 minutes. After 7am on weekday mornings, it takes over an hour going south: 101 is always heavy and there's always a backup on 280 as you get to 380. Going north, starting at 530 pm every evening (including weekends) I have to leave an hour before my arrival: 101 can be a parking lot as you get to 80 and 280 is rarely better. There are virtually no shortcuts. Only plan to live somewhere and do this commute if you have public transport or ride sharing options or a seat on one of those busses that presumably lets you nap while the rest of us schlubs in our cars work on developing chronic high blood pressure.   I've lived in San Mateo and Burlingame for a few decades. Bgame has lovely weather and lots of bougie shopping choices.

AskSF,3816s8,combuchan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, Caltrain connects there too and if you catch the right one there will be less stops to Millbrae since they have rapid trains.  Most decent places near Caltrain or BART you're probably looking at $1,500+ for a bedroom.  You can find it for less I'm sure, but it's definitely more rare and might get competitive."

AskSF,3816s8,coppersense,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:23:33 2015 UTC,"I live in Daly City near Westborough (South SF) and it's a great, safe neighborhood. Daly City is very large. The parts East of the BART tend to be more shady, but there are many nice and decent neighborhoods. I also don't have any issues with 280 in the morning after the 280-380 split.

AskSF,3816s8,liebereddit,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"Some of the most central areas to live in are also pretty close to the freeway.  Burlingame will take you about 30 minutes once you get on the freeway in the morning.   I've lived all over the city for many years. I'dd suggest the Castro /  Church / Hayes Valley / Mission / Noe Valley areas. Street parking is not horrible, once you get used to it. It's easy to get anywhere at any time (BART stops running at midnight), and the areas themselves are super cool and have a lot going on. Be careful of the Mission, because lots of it is still super shady.   If you're going to live in the city, I'd suggest you live somewhere where you can just walk out and have fun. Daly City, Glen Park, and the Sunset are fun haters because they're too far away from everything. The Richmond will take too long to commute from. Downtown/Powell/and the Financial District make it impossible to have a car, and you lose much of the true flavor of SF."

She drives to a bart stop in the morning. She grabs a shuttle from there and I grab bart. Are there any bart stops in SF with parking?  My work schedule is flexible. They said as long as I make a steady schedule, I can come in as late as 10 or as early as 7. I can definitely work around traffic with this option."

Triple Voodoo and the Magnolia/Smokehouse are nearby as well. Cellarmaker is top notch and walking distance to City Beer (a bottle shop with about 10 usually unbelievable taps).  If you hit up the East Bay, Drake's in San Leandro is the best brewery in the Bay Area. They have a wide selection of barrel-aged and unique beers in their Barrel Room. I am fond of Beer Revolution in Oakland (a beer bar/bottle shop) if you want to check a wide array of excellent beers from the region (about 48 taps with beers often brought direct to them). The Rare Barrel in Berkeley has some killer sour beers, if you are into that thing (they won World Beer Cup and GABF golds this year for their sours).  If you are willing to drive a bit, Lagunitas in Petaluma and Russian River in Santa Rosa are world-class operations. They are both in the same direction, but they can be insanely busy on the weekends (RR in particular). If you do hit Russian River and don't want to wait, you can fill one of their growlers or pick up a select few beers (Pliny, as well as a few of the ""'tions"") at the front of the establishment with little to no wait."

They have beer by the pitcher and sangria, as well as wifi and outlets, and food trucks of course. Sometimes it can get loud when there's a game playing on the TVs though.  Mission: Sugarlump (24th and Florida) I think is pretty decent and a little more out of the way. I believe most coffee shops around here will serve beer/wine, don't know of anything with a full bar though.  Castro: Pilsner Inn (Church and Market).

Vinyl, on Divisadero.  Brain Wash, Soma.  My other tip, as a frequent traveler, is up-market hotel lobbies.  Most have really comfortable seating, free wifi and power and will serve you drinks.

A ticket on muni (meaning buses, underground and trams) cost $2.25 and is good for 90mins with multiple use within that 90mins.  If you rent a car you will have a hard time with parking, either you will have to spend a lot on parking garages, make sure you move the car every two hours or keep feeding the meter. If you wanna do day trips outside the city then look into joining Zipcar, you can rent a car by the hour and they have tonnes of locations around the city to get cars from. Although I am not entirely sure if you can rent Zipcar using a UK license, but check it out."

AskSF,37v9h3,cowinabadplace,3,Sat May 30 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"I've only used the tube in London, but it seems to be more reliable than our public transport here because it runs underground.  The Muni trains are more like trams that happen to go underground downtown - outside of the city center they pop above ground and have to deal with traffic signals, congestion, etc. like buses and end up slowing to a crawl.  BART is reliable but it's mostly for commuting, it only stops 8 places in the city whereas Muni pretty much goes everywhere.  Parking can be a huge nightmare - by car, you may get to your destination more quickly but chances are you'll spend 10-15 minutes circling around to find parking negating many time savings.  TL;DR: Take Muni/BART when you can, it's the most economical.  If efficiency is required for specific situations, get a Lyft/Uber/Sidecar or rent a Zipcar for the day.  If you're doing a weekend or multi-day trip, then look into a rental car."

I had never heard of this and freaked out when I saw the proposed new rent. This rule basically states that if you move in to an open room in a unit, the landlord has the right to raise your rent to market rate once the original tenants have completely vacated.   After a bit of research and chatting with the Rent Board and Tenant's Union, it was very clear that this attempt to raise our rent was illegal for two reasons: we had a signed lease and he had failed to mention 6.14 to us when we first moved in. A few emails later, he backed down.  It was a valuable experience though and I learned a lot about 6.14 and Costa Hawkins (another way for landlords to raise rents on rent controlled units)."

If it's a large club I would expect to get ID'ed regardless of how old they think you might be (if the actual question is ""how can I drink at a bar in SF while being underage""). Some other places might not bother, but hard to say for sure.  I believe most of the strip clubs in the city are not too far (walking distance, but you may want to Uber at night if you don't feel like dealing with homeless people or crackheads in the tenderloin) from where you'll be staying; most are in somewhat-seedy areas like the tenderloin, or parts of nob hill.

AskSF,37mf1k,Special_Edition,7,Thu May 28 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"I convinced my landlord to let me have a dog by citing safety concerns (i.e. the dog would act as a burglar deterrent). I'm a petite female, so that probably worked in my favor."
AskSF,37mf1k,stopthebefts,9,Thu May 28 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get a dog in your current apartment.  It will mess up your relationship with the landlord.  Whatever the landlord's reason for not allowing pets (probably due to previous tenants, I'd guess), it's his property.  Using the ""service animal"" workaround may work, but at what cost?"
AskSF,37mf1k,wellvis,4,Thu May 28 20:04:48 2015 UTC,I don't think you understood OP's question.  Their question wasn't should I get a dog.  Their question was does anyone have a suggestion  on how to get the landlord to allow a dog in the apartment.
AskSF,37mf1k,seablizz,7,Thu May 28 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"I believe my answer is appropriate.  The landlord has previously stated he or she doesn't want animals in their property.  My advice was - don't try.  If I was a landlord and someone wanted me to allow something that they had previously agreed not to do (own a dog, run a business from the apartment, etc.), I doubt that any argument would convince me.  However, if you have a suggestion you think might work, I'd welcome your response.  Personally, if the OP wanted to have an animal around, I'd suggest volunteering at an animal shelter or Rocket Dog Rescue."
AskSF,37mf1k,wellvis,5,Thu May 28 20:41:12 2015 UTC,"Your're making good points. I don't have any issues that would qualify for service animals, and I don't want to lie to my doctor and discredit those who have real issues under the surface. I'm more interested if anyone found a dollar amount, brokered a deal, or just was persistent enough to get a pet exemption."
AskSF,37mf1k,ishbot,2,Thu May 28 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"I just want to add in addition to the shelters you've listed, if /u/Special_Edition is interested in volunteering at a rescue I would really really recommend muttville.   They are a senior dog rescue and only take dogs 7 or older, since they have such a hard time finding homes and being adopted since everyone wants a puppy instead. These dogs are very sweet and older and would absolutely love the attention and company."
AskSF,37mf1k,coppersense,2,Fri May 29 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"Since you asked and the landlord said no, your best bet is to find a place that does allow pets. Not the answer you want to hear, but weigh you priorities. There are so many people who want to rent units, landlords can easily find people matching their criteria without making special exceptions.     At the end of the day, you're a source of income to a landlord. One that hopefully treats his/her property with respect. You're not family or a best friend so s/he need not make special exceptions."
AskSF,37mf1k,ishbot,1 point,Sun May 31 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"My landlady originally said no pets but after a few years we approached her about getting a cat with a pet deposit and because we had a great relationship, she agreed.   Unfortunately since you've already asked and been denied, i'm not sure what else you can do. Maybe approach the topic again in a while and in addition to everything else, promise you'll get an adult small dog less than 25 pounds? Most apartments that allow dogs in the city seem to use that as the size limit, and getting an adult dog rather than a puppy sounds much better."

Edit: Next time you're going to be a dick to somebody with no proof, try asking them a question first to see if they're just ""gaming the system."" OP asked a specific question I have direct experience with, so I answered. I did not tell OP to lie, or pretend to be depressed, I just asked if OP's dog helped with anything."
AskSF,37mf1k,eugenesbluegenes,3,Thu May 28 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"The system gets abused. Maybe you're not abusing it, but a lot of people are and that's calls the legitimacy of everyone in to question.  OP just wants a dog. There's a very fuzzy line between really needing a support dog and just wanting one and that's the gap you are encouraging them to cross. I mean, should everyone who is depressed be able to have a pet despite having already signed a lease regarding rental terms?"
AskSF,37mf1k,NealMcBeal__NavySeal,3,Thu May 28 22:20:51 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about legitimacy then don't immediately assume everyone with a support animal is gaming the system. That just adds to the stigma and the mentality that mental health issues are not as real as other conditions. Along those same lines using phrases such as ""really needing"" undermines the validity of what we live with everyday. It might not look like ""really needing"" to you, but you aren't in my head, so you can't know.   Other than that, I agree with you. Although I'd probably be okay with somebody gaming the system to save a dog from a shelter, for example (if the dog was going to be well taken care of, the landlord was either somewhat okay with it or an asshole, and there wouldn't be damage done to the apartment). I'm okay with getting a little less respect/ recognition if an animal can live because of it. That's just me though, and not a call I'd make on behalf of everyone else."

I don't want to stir up a debate, so feel free to correct me or whatever, I don't care, but my understanding is that those amorphous pieces of chicken are either from dead laying hens, or recently hatched male laying hen chicks, for which the industry has no use.  Those bits often do not have an easily sold shape (egg laying hens near the ends of their lives are often electrocuted to produce a last flurry of eggs, and this can liquefy their bones), so the resulting meat is reconstituted into nice little chunks for human consumption.    I got this from that Michael Pollan NYT article, back in the day, if you're wondering where my info comes from."

But it at least makes sense as an explanation for where the meat comes from.  I mean obviously you're not just going to throw away the hen's meat after it's dead, and you need to do something with male laying hens.  Googling it produces a bunch of results that have nothing to do with animal cruelty (well, maybe a little bit):  https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS495US495&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=laying%20hen%20meat  https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS495US495&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=male%20laying%20hen%20chicks"

AskSF,37ml3c,bobobo1618,1 point,Fri May 29 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"I have experience with this.  The management company in charge of my rent controlled building ""allowed it"" with the stipulation that the person moving in was an authorized inhabitant (forget the exact term), rather than being added to the lease as if it was a roommate. The rent had to continue being submitted 100% by the original tenant.    When I researched the situation, I read articles indicating management could require things like a full application with a credit/background check, but that they couldn't reject your domestic partner because of a spotty credit rating (because they arent allowed to pay the rent anyway).    It hasn't come up for me, but I believe the ramification of this is that if you move out, your domestic partner couldn't assume the lease in their name with the same rent control. The original tenant has to continue soley paying the rent and live in the unit.  All in all it's farely straight forward.  I suggest getting the San Francisco version rather than the California version of Domestic Partnership, because I think the state one adds some complxity to your taxes etc.  The SF version is pretty much only relates to San Francisco laws/policies."

One huge double standard that was pretty common before marriage equality was that many employers required proof of domestic partnership from homosexual couples for partner benefits, but for heterosexual couples simply accepted ""I'm married"" with no documentation required.  So yeah, you're right, in recent pre-equality history the issue of domestic partnership did come up for homosexual couples more often than it did for heterosexual couples, since many employers weren't checking the latter."

I usually just hear ""summer fog"" out here, it's different and more intense than what goes on in SoCal.  In both areas it tends to catch tourists off guard, who think California is permanently 80+ degrees and sunny everywhere."
AskSF,37jpnc,gassy_broccoli_fart,1 point,Thu May 28 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"June Gloom:       June Gloom is a southern California term for a weather pattern that results in cloudy, overcast skies with cool temperatures during the late spring and early summer, most commonly in the month of June. Low-altitude stratus clouds are formed over the ocean, then transported over the coastal regions by the wind.  The overcast skies often are accompanied by fog and drizzle, though usually not rain.  June Gloom in southern California is caused by the marine layer effect common to the West Coast,  and is enhanced by the Catalina eddy local to southern California. May and June together are usually the cloudiest months in coastal Southern California.  June Gloom has other colloquial names (ie. May Grey) if the same weather pattern occurs in May, July, or August. June Gloom is stronger in years associated with a La Niña, and weaker or nonexistent in years with an El Niño. This weather pattern occurs in other parts of the world where climates and conditions are similar.  Scientists study the cloud fields that make up June Gloom to increase understanding of cloud behavior at the onset of drizzle and precipitation.

Be prepared to deal with the Teamsters Union regarding bringing your equipment into the venue and setting up.  They have very specific functions and can be somewhat restrictive when it comes to you doing something they feel they're supposed to do.  There are plenty of print shops in the area who can make such banners for you.  You'd have to contact a few to get a quote for your specific job (the size and quantity will make a difference).  In general, the flyers, business cards, brochures, and banners will be handled the same way as in India.  If you have the budget and can afford some sort of giveaway item (""tchotchke"") with your company's logo or information, that can be useful.  Things that people collect are items such as pens, glass cleaning cloths, etc. If not, just a bowl of hard candies (available at any grocery store or drug store) will be appreciated.

There are plenty of other recommendations available by searching in this subreddit or in /r/sffood. Tell her you're coming out of the closet.  Buy her a house.  Put a ring on it. La Taqueria.

AskSF,37cpvq,wellvis,3,Tue May 26 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking on /u/wellvis because he has some of the consistently best answers here.  Making my own adjustments.   Fort Point is Awesome, but if you're getting a car and planning to cross the Golden Gate Bridge anyway, the best view is from the Marin Headlands, on the last righthand exit coming toward the bridge from the North (going South) or first righthand exit after you cross the Bridge going North, and then left turn to go under the highway. The other classic view is from the foot of the Sutro Tower. I think the best restaurants for your buck in town right now are SPQR and Kokkari.  Foreign Cinema ain't bad, though.  Nopa is another favorite. Surprising your girlfriend is really about what she is into.  Cocktails at Tonga Room?  Cocktails at the Top of the Mark?  Brewery tour of Anchor Steam?  Take the Ferry to Alameda and tour St. George/Hangar One distillery?  Penis cake lollipop from the Castro? La Taqueria.  But, you can't go too wrong in the Mission.  Make sure to get pork on your burrito, either Carnitas or al Pastor.  Otherwise, you haven't had a burrito. Shopping depends on what you want.  Wander the Haight, Lower Haight, Polk St, the Mission for lots of boutiques.  Union Square is the place for high-end brands. I'd say the Mission is my favorite SF Gem.  Wander Mission St from 16th to 24th, wander 24th St from Mission toward Potrero a few blocks then back to Valencia and then down Valencia to 16th.  Most guidebooks fail to include the Mission and it's my favorite place in SF to walk.   Edit: Fixed the pork."

AskSF,37cpvq,juaquin,1 point,Tue May 26 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"My thoughts (as a fellow Swede in case that makes any difference).   San Francisco is a beautiful place but I wouldn't say it has a single most awesome thing. The golden gate bridge is pretty special, also any place with a good view such as twin peaks or the top of russian or potrero hill is great. There are so many good restaurants I don't know where to start. In terms of cheap stuff you should have banh mi (preferably at Saigon Sandwich shop) and burritos. When it comes to excellent mid range places Central Kitchen, Zuni Cafe, Alembic and Alta Ca are good options. Then there are a bunch of michelin star places to explore if you want to take it that far. There are also some spectacular (often with long lines) brunches such as Dottie's, Brendas Soulfood and Zazie's. A good restaurant would be my recommendation. You can also go have the tackiest cocktail experience ever at the Tonga Room (eat before though, the food is not very impressive).  Find a place with a proper griddle. La Taqueria is great but often crowded. I think Pancho Villa is rock solid too. Union Square is the place for big brands. For places with more character Hayes Valley, Upper Haight, Chestnut Street and Valencia Street are good options. I'm a beer enthusiast so City Beer Store, Mikkeller and Cellar Maker (you can easily do all three in one night) is a great little bar round. There are also lots of excellent cocktail bars such as Tradition, Bourbon and Branch, Alembic, Rickhouse, Smugglers Cove etc.   Finally, bring your jacket. San Francisco might sound like a place where the sun is always shining and you drink margaritas on the beach. The truth is that it's a city that requires a jacket unless you are in the sun."
AskSF,37cpvq,ishbot,1 point,Tue May 26 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone else had good ideas for things to do as a tourist, but my personal favorite view in the city is Grand View Park. Better than Twin Peaks and not crowded with tour buses.  Lots of good suggestions already. Burma Superstar and it's cousin B Star are interesting. For something fancy, Frances in the Castro and L’ardoise in Duboce Triangle are good. There's also a lot of great casual options depending on where you're staying. Propose? Dunno, depends on what she likes. I like a ""California"" burrito from Los Coyotes. If you want a more SF style ""Mission"" burrito, the ones people have listed are good. Depends on what you're shopping for. Most big retail in the city is near Union Square, which is otherwise a pretty shitty place to be. I try to avoid it. Have to agree with Lands End / Sutro Baths. The California Academy of Sciences is really cool - indoor rainforest, huge aquarium, imax theatre, and there are other cool things to do in Golden Gate park while you're there (Japanese tea garden, Conservatory of Flowers, the De Young art museum, etc)."

There are a ton of bike rental places around the Fisherman's wharf area, and you can either ride over the bridge and back, or ride over the bridge down to Sausalito and then take a ferry ride back to SF.  Depends on what kind of best dinner you're thinking - but something that I think is fun and delicious is going to Streat Food in SOMA or Off the Grid for dinner. I'm pretty indecisive so I love being able to walk around and see all the food trucks and eat a bunch of different food. If you want a nice sit down dinner experience any of the other suggestions here would be a solid choice. Does she have any particular interests? Napa and Sonoma aren't too far - you could rent a car for a day and do a nice day trip of wine tasting through the vineyards.  La Taqueria! Although there are so many good choices here you really can't go wrong. Union Square and Market & Powell are where there are a lot of big brand stores, and there's the Westfield Mall right there on market. If you're looking for boutique-y stores or smaller local shops, you could walk around Haight or the Mission and make a fun day of it. Union Street in the Marina also has some smaller shops, cafes and restaurants.  I guess its not particularly SF specific, but on a nice day, I love grabbing some beers/drinks and food, finding a park, and just laying around eating and relaxing. I love doing this in Golden Gate park - its huge and you can always walk around and explore as well (see if you can find the bison!) but Dolores park is famous for this and gets pretty busy.    If you're here on a Thursday night, you should go to Nightlife at the Academy of Sciences, which is every Thursday evening, or After Dark at the Exploratorium, which is the first Thursday of every month. I prefer After Dark, but both are really fun - the museums open up in the evening for adults only and serve drinks."

Most of the hotels and motels are found in three areas - Union Square (center of town, close to public transportation and shopping), Fisherman's Wharf (near Pier 39 and some tourist attractions, but a rather tacky section of the city otherwise), and Lombard Street (good choice for people who have to have a car while here, as most places offer parking).  Lombard Street hotels are pretty far from the more popular parts of the city, though close to Chestnut Street and the Marina.  There are very few hotels near Golden Gate Park, but the park is easily accessible by street car and bus from any of the three areas I mentioned.

AskSF,3763nk,eugenesbluegenes,2,Mon May 25 05:16:47 2015 UTC,Insurance. Anticipate about $2000+/yr.  Also consider the neighbor for street versus garage. How crowded is it? How often do you find people circling for spaces? How many smashed windows do you see on a regular basis?
AskSF,3763nk,coppersense,2,Mon May 25 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"To get the actual permit, you just need to provide proof that you live there. As others have said, finding parking is a different story. It really depends on your neighborhood. I brought my car to the city when I moved here and it was great when I lived in Potrero Hill - always had parking readily available, and since that neighborhood is a bit more on the outskirts I found myself using my car a lot. But now I live in the Mission/Castro area, and it's mostly just a hassle. Circling around for parking, worrying about smashed windows, etc. The central location makes having a car pretty unnecessary as well - some weeks the only time I drive is to move my car for street sweeping, which is definitely annoying."

It will be broken in to. Fortunately, I've never had my windows smashed or anything of value taken. One thing to consider is that you will need to move the car frequently for street cleaning. If you are not using the car often, this can be quite annoying.   If you don't mind saying, what is the zone you will be parking in? How crowded the zones are really varies. You should look around your neighborhood this week to see how parked up it is. Also, if you are not commuting for work you can move your car during the off hours which should help.

It's a half-mile trek, but you can take three Uber XL or Lyft Plus cars there (or at least for the older folk), which would run you maybe $20 for the entire party.  2) Jardinière is nice, albeit definitely on the pricier and more foo foo side, but they do put out good food. It can be a tad stuffy (they get a large opera-goer diners).  3) Otherwise, Absinthe (as suggested by /u/TheAntiPedantic) is a superb option as well. They've really recaptured their former glory IMO.  3 -> 1 -> 2 go from more casual to upscale. Zuni is my personal choice, but get a reservation sooner than later.

Not to mention the tickets that you will be getting at some point.   Between walking/biking, Muni, BART, Lyft/Uber/Sidecar, and Zipcar/City Car Share, getting around is fairly easy without owning your own car.

I don't think it's illegal as long as it doesn't obstruct your vision, obviously I wouldn't leave anything of value in the car after that, so I guess it depends how much you care about your car.  If you need a place to get your window fixed, I've used Power Auto Glass before when I needed a new windshield immediately before a trip I was taking, they were incredibly fast about it and didn't charge very much.

AskSF,36wh90,orageslointains,5,Sat May 23 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"mm.  well, it seems to me that michelin lines up with a very specific sort of food and sf does it really well with our chef-driven, tightly-focused, very local ingredients, very chummy/clubby/villagesque scene with loads of cross-pollination across a relatively small geographic area. when everyone knows everyone else, you get consensus and cohesion, which is fertile ground for something like a michelin guide to codify, promote and otherwise commercialize.  throw in the fact of sf's tourist draw, the cable cars, hills, walkability, natty iconic vistas and monuments, and the cohesion of sf as a food city, that brand aspect, is just made for teevee.  and in that difference in ethos i'm guessing we get at something approaching the economic rationale - people in and visiting los angeles aren't really paying attention to michelin, los angeles isn't consumable qua city in the same way that sf is, the scene is just difficult, the locals have their singular insular culture that spins independently of your michelins or zagats or whatever.  spend some time there, it's really something, like a strange american city-state.  to put it another way, independent of the mechanics of how food tourism works in sf viz la, the thing with los angeles is that they have so much of everything that the vastness reaches a point of almost impenetrability, leading people to go to ""hot"" spots promoted by critics or bloggers or other trusted sources.  it's harder just to discover a place down there.  people rave about the chinese food in sf and will blast off the same 6-8 places, where in los angeles the equivalent person would struggle to get past the same one or two places that they and everyone else in their cohort knows and always visits, even though there are possibly 20x more straight-up chinese restaurants there than there are here (for example).  it just doesn't align with the michelin ethos."

Also much better cheaper food- better street carts, better $10 turkey burgers, better delis, better Jewish food, better cheap quick lunch options, etc.    The things SF does better than NYC food wise is:  more organic, vegan, vegetarian stuff, the quality of the produce is way better, better Mexican and some varieties of Asian food.

It doesn't matter if you're on a lease or not. They also can't just ask you to move.   If you're not protected under rent control it's much better for you to have a lease.  Certain things go into rent control qualification like age of the building and Number of units in the building.  Your best bet is to contact these people. All they do is answer questions like yours. They're very happy to do so.  http://www.sfrb.org/index.aspx?page=10"
AskSF,36q7k3,liebereddit,4,Thu May 21 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"it is pretty common here - especially in rent controlled apartments. Often the cost of getting new leases drawn up etc takes away the benefit for the landlord of raising the rent.  We've been in our place 2 years and have only had 1 raise. We're month to month since month 13 but nothing has changed, and we're still protected."
AskSF,36q7k3,deadershoppingmalls,3,Thu May 21 13:55:48 2015 UTC,I'd ask here:  http://www.sftu.org/
AskSF,36q7k3,westhest,1 point,Thu May 21 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"If you are under rent control, once your lease is up (so long as it's a year or more), you are allowed to continue living at the apartment on a month to month basis under the same stipulations of the of the original lease agreement. And, as others have said, they can only raise the rent once a year to a maximum rate that is set by the city on a yearly basis. This rate typically fluctuates between 1% and 2%. Which, for a $3000/ month apartment comes to a $30-$60 increase... Something that I suspect isn't going to break your bank.   It's strange that your landlord isn't raising rent. Maybe they are being nice. Maybe the are trying something malicious. I've had landlords do both.   But something that is really important as a tenant in sf is EDUCATE YOURSELF. Know your rights.  Also it's always better to keep things with your landlord as courteous as possible. Sometimes they might not like it when you flex your rights as a tenant, but if you just convey that you understand their position, but have to make the choices that are best for you, things will work out.   Again, I don't know what they might be up to, but you should feel pretty confident that they can only raise your rent around 1-2% a year.   So basically, if is is  A RENT CONTROLLED APPARENT, you are fine not writing another lease. If not, rules are way different and I'm unfamiliar with those situations but it's likely better to pursue another lease."

I've had landlords do both.    They're allowed to ""bank"" the increases and do it all at once using the applicable rates from the previous years. Pretty common in my experience. I've had my rent raised twice in the 7 years I've lived in my current rent controlled place. It still works out better for the tenant, since you aren't paying that higher rent in the intervening time, but you can end up with a bigger hike at once."
AskSF,36q7k3,bigshmoo,1 point,Sat May 23 22:42:37 2015 UTC,When was the building built?  Is is multi unit?  that will dictate what if any rent control protection you have.   Even if it's not rent controlled the eviction protections still apply.  Going month-to-month after the initial term is pretty standard around here.
AskSF,36q7k3,TookFiveMarijuanas,1 point,Fri May 22 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"It honestly likely doesn't matter, since the housing laws here are very strongly on your side. I've not heard of any places here that would expect you to sign a subsequent yearly lease after your first lease is up (and requiring someone to do so is probably not even legal, except in one particular instance described below if I read the SFTU website correctly).  First of all, if the building is rent controlled (most buildings in SF, most common criteria is that the building was built before 1979), they can only raise the rent by 1.9% a year unless making capital improvements (full details here: http://www.sftu.org/rentcontrol/). Whether it's rent controlled or not shouldn't be a mystery, you're required to sign a rent control addendum in that case when you first rent the apartment.  Second of all, they cannot simply force you out with 30-60 days notice, there is a set list of reasons for ""just cause"" eviction, the only one that might be possibly applicable here based on what you've told us would be #5 (and I'd think that only specifically applies if there is a set end date to the occupancy in the lease; if the lease explicitly permits going month-to-month then this isn't a valid reason). See here: http://www.sftu.org/justcauses/  Unless you've been a problem tenant or the landlord is trying to renovate/sell the building/convert it into condos I don't think you have much to worry about, and is probably not worth hassling the landlord over.  You might wish to actually talk to someone at the SF Tenants Union if you're still uncertain, or your building/unit is not subject to rent control."

As for standing in front of the doors, yeah, I know... this shouldn't be the kind of thing that people need instructions for, but it seems like putting those stencils on the floor showing where to stand and where to keep a space open like how BART does it would help out a lot."

When I'm the one who is behind the person holding things up, I feel a pressure to do something about it, I kinda feel equally guilty if I don't at least say ""excuse me.""

There should be better signage to guide people to not crowd the exit/entrance of the MUNI doors. I think BART has markers on the ground as to where to stand back. As for standing on the left side of an escalator... as easy as calling someone out in a polite manner and they'll learn to move aside.   As for giving up your seat for the elderly/handicapped... hard to teach people that. Everyone on the bus is listening to music, too involved with Candy Crush to look up. If I have a seat, I'll make it vocal, offer my seat even if I am not closest to the elderly person and hopefully people feel embarrassed they didn't do so as well. Wishful thinking though.  Also, I'll be called out here, but old Asian people don't give a f&#@ if they board first, push you out of the way for a seat, hoard seats for the friend, talk loudly, clip their toenails.

AskSF,36o3lk,techrat_reddit,1 point,Wed May 20 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"I am a local here, but I once got pickpocketted in the most popular district of SF. I don't remember the exact location, but it was near Macy's.   I was walking down the pavement when I noticed three teenagers eyeing me. I didn't think too much about it, and kept walking, but I soon noticed that one of the guys suddenly passed me and was pacing right in front of me. Then, the next one started to pace next to me as well, slowing me down. At this point, I thought something was suspicious, so I stopped very suddenly and pretended that I check out the TV display. Apparently the third guy was behind me the whole time, and he walked away as if nothing happened. I checked my bag and lo and behold, the zipper of my front pocket of my bag was open. To be honest, I am very alert and almost paranoid, but I was surprised I didn't notice this guy unzipping my bag right behind me. Luckily, that pocket didn't contain anything, but I was really surprised how easily I was fooled.   In hindsight, I think the two guys that were in front of me and next to me was trapping me, so that I walk slower. The guy next to me prevented me from passing the guy in front of me while the guy behind me was opening up my bag.  The lesson is this OP. Among my peers, I am usually the most careful one, but the fact that I almost got my stuff stolen in the daylight on one of the most populous street means nowhere is safe. If you have valuables, put them where you are aware of their existence whole time."

AskSF,36m2ja,mousefoe,2,Wed May 20 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, not a local, but I've been doing a bunch of research in anticipation of my own trip to SF next month. Locals, if I get anything wrong please correct me.   There's something called BART as I understand, and I don't know if I'll be able to use that or not.  What if google sends me on BART but I don't have a pass?   The pass you linked will not be valid on BART. BART has a variable fare from $1.85 to $5.50 depending on how far you go.  You can get a rechargeable farecard called a Clipper Card that works on both MUNI and BART, and your MUNI pass can be added to the clipper card so that when you are on MUNI it will get you on free from your pass, then when you are on BART it will draw from the stored balance you put on the card when you buy it."
AskSF,36m2ja,Gumburcules,1 point,Wed May 20 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a valid option too, thanks! Do you know if we can pay cash on BART as well? You can pay cash for MUNI as far as I can understand but not sure about BART"
AskSF,36m2ja,Gumburcules,2,Wed May 20 14:40:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ticket machines at BART stations accept cash, but I would probably recommend getting the Clipper card.   It's only $3 and it eliminates the step of getting your ticket at the station which you will thank me for if you show up right as the train arrives and have to sit there and wait up to 20 minutes for the next train because you were getting your ticket at the train pulled away.    Plus all the locals will probably hate you as you're holding up the line fumbling for cash/your ticket instead of just waving your card and walking on through. At least that's how it works on the DC Metro where I'm from."

AskSF,36m2ja,wellvis,2,Wed May 20 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"BART is the Bay Area Rapid Transit - it covers a wider area of the Bay Area than MUNI.  There are several BART stations in San Francisco, but for the most part if you're going to be using public transit in San Francisco, you'll be using MUNI - streetcars, cable cars, or buses.  Your SFMTA visitor pass will cover public transit within the city except for BART.  That shouldn't be a problem for you unless you're going to Oakland, Berkeley, or SFO.  You can easily transfer between street cars and buses.  All of the BART stations in the downtown area share their station with a MUNI streetcar station.  It would be nice if the cable cars ran to Golden Gate Park, but you're probably thinking of the light rail street cars (the N-Judah line in particular).  The SFMTA website has way more information.  As far as getting to the park on time, give yourself more time than they say.  If you're travelling on the weekend, the N-Judah line may be affected by construction - they'll have buses running the same route."

AskSF,36lls1,Jose_Monteverde,7,Wed May 20 07:58:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, the SF Bay Area isn't in any big threat from tsunamis. Think about it, there have been several large earthquakes in the last hundred or so years that have cause sizable damage and death, but nowhere do you hear of any resulting tsunamis.   This has to do with the under water geometry in the area. IIRC the Bay Area coast rises relatively sharply from the deep, making it hard for the lateral energy of the way to propagate.   The north coast of California and parts of Alaska, on the other hand, have a much more gradual, sloping, underwater geometry that let's the wave gradually change it's energy from lateral to horizontal.   Look up ""crescent city tsunamis"" and it should explain better. I'd link it but I'm on mobile.   Also the only person in the US to die as a result of the 2011 japan earthquake drowned near Arcada California."

When looking at AirBnB, I'd recommend looking for something that's easily accessible to public transportation.  In general the Civic Center and SOMA won't offer as optimal a housing experience as other areas of the city.

Here are a few pointers:  1) You're going to have a tough time securing any of the Craigslist listings without being present in-person to get your foot in the door fast. Look into temporary housing options for 1-2 months and put together a ""housing package"" with alot of your personal, financial, and economical information to give to prospective landlords. Alternatively, look into apartment units which are going to be more expensive, but allow you to sign a lease remotely.   2) San Francisco neighborhoods vary wildly. In fact, even the streets vary wildly in terms of safety/sketchiness/price. If you have any contacts in the area, I would suggest getting them to walk the area/view the neighborhood for you. It isn't enough to say that SoMa is a good neighborhood, or that the Tendernob is all bad. You have good and bad areas of all places (except, of course, some of the most expensive).    3) San Francisco is incredibly expensive. I am easily outspending most of my fellow college grads on my place. It's going to take a bit of fortitude to get over the sticker shock that you may experience. Because of this, I suggest you make a budget and truly sit down with your roommates to figure out what you are willing to spend, where you are willing to live, and how you plan to live your life for the foreseeable future.  Best of luck!"

AskSF,36l95z,conjunctionjunction1,1 point,Wed May 20 07:08:20 2015 UTC,"I second the notion of getting an AirBNB for a while before settling in. It's sometimes cheaper than hotel/apts and you can move about a bit better. There are hacker houses too which are valid options. There are 1-2 in Mission district which are Airbnb hacker houses but they may be kinda sketch. YMMV tho.  For your friends: The area is innundated with junior level web developers (mostly fresh-out-of-bootcamp) so the wow factor will be portfolio, portfolio, github account, portfolio. It's so much harder to get a job from outside of the city, though.  Are they Ruby or Python developers?    Edit: 4-5 yrs is mid level to senior level for some. If they can show good code skillz, they should be fine. Fuck not having a degree. Some of the best minds don't. :)   For you: you should be fine with mid- to high level. Try your contacts from your dribbble meetup. They may know some people in SF. The field is small enough that people know people. Getting a job through a contact is much better than surfing thru craigslist ads.  Also, protip. Try Angel.co for startup jobs. As well as hired.com   And if you can wing it, get an SF address.

If you were to BART, from the terminal you walk across the street to the AirBART, take the elevator up, and board the AirBART train. You're totally good to go there as far as large bags, that train has been designed with a big wide open interior for travelers like you.   At Coliseum, you can take the elevator down to the platform and transfer to regular BART - the Fremont-Daly City Line will take you to Mission without any more transfers.   At this point, I would say it really depends on the time of day you are arriving. If it's noon or 9 PM, you're fine. If it's rush hour, it's gonna be a bear to try and find space to camp out on the train.

You do need to buy an unlocked phone outright to use the Cricket plan. You can buy a refurbished, unlocked iPhone 5c on eBay for $200. Even if you get one of the cheapest Sprint or T-Mobile plans, it will still cost you more after 2 years than Cricket's $35 plan and a $200 5c. Cell phone contracts suck."

There is the Computer History museum, but it's in San Jose, about 80 km. away.  The 'International Museum of Art' is a bit of a joke... almost all of the paintings are bythis one guy, seems to be some kind of cult leader. But it's free, and right in the middle of the Mid-Market tech-boom area.  The Financial district- where all the tall buildings are- is a good place to go for lunch. There is tremendous competition for the $ of the many office workers there, so there are many options for quick, good and relatively cheap food, but only at lunch time.

The low point was when I pulled a large knife on the SRO dwellers next door after I'd exhausted all other options. Absolutely not my proudest moment in life, but suddenly me and the scumbags spoke the same language, and I finally got the result I needed.  Anyway, what's so critical about the fact that your neighbor is a medical supply company?  Because they're Russian. They're russian, right? Russians have a near-monopoly on DME (durable medical equipment) in our fair city.  You don't fuck with the Russians. Well I don't, and I've had plenty of dealings with this demographic over the past couple of decades.  My response to you was gonna be, escalate, you can totally win this! But not now. They've already sent you a decent Russian-style fuck you -- the message is that we know the system better than you...we are players and you are not.  And the fact that you are worried about impending ""fines"" from DPH shows that they were completely correct. Dear OP, DPH has no power to fine you. So now you are in a position of needless worry, just where they want you.  You actually do have certain positions of strength in this situation, but I'm not going to make a long post with strategies, since you need to Not Give a Fuck in order to gain some leverage.

The Department of Public Health doesn't, but the Department of Works sure does.  Section 170(2) of the SF Public Works Code states that trash receptacles must be removed from the sidewalk, street or any other public right of way 24 hours after collection has taken place. In addition, the receptacles must be moved to a location not visible from the street.  Section 170(5)c lays out the fines for leaving the cans on the sidewalk ($80 - $500) and specifies that those fines can be collected per Section 39-1 of the police code. So, yeah, it's enforcable.  OP, I don't have all the details, and I hate to say it, but I think you're screwed. You're going to need to figure out where to put the cans. You may need to buy or build a little lockable shed.  I was going to say that this was all part of Gavin Newsom's ridiculous war on trash in 2007, but it looks like it was actually Ex-Supervisor Jake McGoldrick who inflicted this on the city."

It would be hard to find a case where they actually have, regarding trash cans not put away out-of-sight.  It's a totally reasonable law, with a reasonable goal. Trash cans are yucky and unsanitary, also: property values. My opinion anyway.

Assuming that that's the case, I'd opt to keep 1 car and park it in a garage.     I may get flamed for saying this, but in my opinion public transit in the Bay Area is mediocre at best. It's okay for routine trips like to/from work at specific times and for going downtown (since driving and parking in that part of town is a pain), but it's not all that convenient at other times.      That said, if that's mostly all you do, then an occasional Uber/Lyft or ZipCar might be fine. If you're at all like me, though, there's the gym to drive to that's across town, restaurants in the Richmond, Sunset, Dogpatch, Chinatown, etc. that can be inconvenient to get  to via public transit, weekend hikes and bike rides down on the Peninsula or up in Marin, camping trips, doctor's appointments, a jaunt to IKEA on a weekend to buy something for my place, grocery shopping at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or some other place, etc. For me personally, having a car saves me a huge amount of time, hassle, and even money at the end of the day.

Ditch the Mazda, keep the TDI - $200 is pretty good for a garage. Street parking your car as a means of storage is a pain in the ass and eventually with tickets and broken windows you will probably break even on the cost as compared to the garage. Zipcar adds up - want to go to costco? 4 hours, $45. Want to drive up the coast for a day? One day, $100.

Then there's moving your car for street cleaning, or the 72 hour limit (city wide to prevent people storing their cars for extended periods on city streets) if you happen to go on vacation which you'll have to deal with at some point.

My daily driver is an automatic, so it would be an adjustment for me-- I have more confidence but less skill than she does in the manual transmission department.

AskSF,36g11y,pedroah,1 point,Wed May 20 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"I think that is not the right way to phrase it.  I cannot tell if you you are basing this on our discussion here or what, but just because we are more vocal about it, doesn't mean it's right for everyone.    Bicycling through SF is certainly intimidating sometimes despite all the facilities and improvements that have been added to foster the growth of bicycle use.  Now if only we could get across the Bay Bridge...  For me right now, my bike is the right tool.  Muni takes 3 times longer, and driving takes twice as long (accounting for time to park).    For some people Muni is the right tool, it is inexpensive compared to driving but has a higher time cost; for some people who work weird hours it doesn't work so well because most lines don't start service until 6am.  Then for some people private car is the most reasonable option because they can't ride a bike for whatever reason (or won't).  Dunno...  That month I drove to work was because I could only get subsidized parking if I bought a monthly ticket thru my employer (it cost the same as two days at market rate) and Muni was having some terrible issues at the time.  The capacity on the bus line I took to work was reduced and the muni union people were blocking buses from leaving the yard.

AskSF,36gjly,Winifreth,3,Tue May 19 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"Most of the hotels are in the touristy areas, but I would say stay at an Airbnb in Mission which doesn't have any. You'll save a lot of money, and if you aim for something between the 16th and mission BART and the Van Ness MUNI station, you'll be very VERY connected to the city, and basically has a direct public transportation connection to anywhere in the city. Mission has a very hispanic flavor, and is far enough away from the tenderloin that you should feel safe at night. Typical tourist mistake is to think that all of SF exists within North Beach. You should spend a day in pretty much each one of the city's neighborhoods to get a feel for it. Our neighborhoods are very well-defined, as they tend to have very steep hills that function as barriers for pedestrian traffic. Spend a day going down Haight (pronounced Hate) street. On another day go down Mission, and come back up on Valencia. More fun stuff can be found on sosh.com. Land's End has some really amazing views of the ocean. Twin Peaks has some really good views of the city, too, so save that for your last day. Make sure you go sailing at least once, too. Yes, it is in Marin.   I hope you have a good time here!

They sell snacks and beer and wine on board, and you can hang out in Sausalito for a bit before heading back into the city.   Sausalito is a small town, and a bit touristy on the end by the ferries, but if you walk along the waterfront you'll see lots of boats, and on Caledonia Street there are some nice restaurants (including some of the best Sushi I've ever had)."

You may be able to find some stuff towards the north of the city. I think I remember seeing one or two hotels that were around that price range, but in a much safer neighborhood.

It is fairly close to the Powell Street MUNI Metro Station. It is also close to the Glide Memorial Church where a lot of homeless people receive social services so it is not a good neighborhood. But there are a few interesting things in the area. At the end of Taylor Street is the flatiron building seen in the film Interview With The Vampire. And north of my hotel is the Bohemian Club.  I also considered Hotel Bohème in North Beach but it is too expensive for what you get. The Red Victorian in Haight/Ashbury seems too much like a hostel. Hotel Tomo in Japantown might be good if you like anime.
AskSF,36gjly,webauteur,1 point,Tue May 19 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"The location of the Mark Twain will be fine for you.  That’s basically on the edges of the hotel district surrounding Union Square and there will be plenty of tourist/shopping foot traffic.  This is the case of most hotels in the Tenderloin.  You are going to get panhandled, and you are going to see many homeless people, but roving groups of dangerous criminals preying on tourists is not something I’ve witnessed.  There is not a noticeable organized gang presence or anything.  Those neighborhoods are elsewhere, have no hotels, and are not of interest to most tourists."

AskSF,36ed0z,SlowInFastOut,2,Tue May 19 01:42:40 2015 UTC,"Considering that the Mountain Bike was invented on Mt. Tam, I'd recommend going there.  There are over a dozen bike-rental companies in teh city- renting bikes to tourists to ride over the GG bridge and back has become big business.  I recommend avoiding the big firms-  they have hundreds of poorly-maintined, cheap crappy bikes that would be okay only if you're a granny or need a child trailer or something- many offer guided tours and ferry tickets too.   A better place to look may be a real bike shop that also rents higher-end bikes- there are a few in the city, and also several in Marin, closer to the mountain.  Riding to the top of Mt. Tam may be a bit ambitious, but here are scores of not-too-hard, beautiful rides around the hills and lakes above Fairfax."

AskSF,36byb2,NotFromKentucky,2,Mon May 18 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, and learned a few things, from recommendations from wellvis. Rather than reinventing the wheel I'll focus on rounding it out.    Quality coffee shops: Philz is good. Lately I've been haunting /r/coffee working down the path of improving my pour-overs at home. That lead me to House of Coffee in the Outer Sunset. This is a family owned establishment that's been around for 40 years. The owner Henry Kalebjian is a Master Roaster, you can drop in and watch him roasting beans daily. They're pretty generous with the sampling available stock.  Foodie-loving eateries: This is a city that will put 10-lbs on you in a month. Too much good food. Something like Off the Grid is perfect for sampling lots of food trucks in a short amount of time. For a taste of Pittsburgh, check out Giordano Bros in North Beach.  Having sampled the original Permanti Bros, and the one at Market Square, I think I prefer Giordano Bros. Key difference is each ingredient going into the sandwiches here seem incredibly fresh. May be a supply-chain thing.  Quirky shopping areas: Don't quite know what this means. But I once bought a Mexican wrestler mask for $10 in the Mission district on a Sunday. Make of that what you will.  Oddball movie theaters: The Roxie Theater, Mission district. Once showed up for a documentary. Beer was had. Friendly conversations with staff. More beer was had. Got a tour of the neighboring theater including some of the oldest working projectors in the city. I would like to think this is business as usual.  Beer emporiums: I'm shocked I was unaware of The Beer Advocate amazing list. I'm going to stick with a few favorites in North Beach. La Trappe tends to have rare imported beers I've never. Church key is a similar, if smaller, atmosphere. They usually have sour beers on tap which catches my interest. If you don't come to the west coast often, Rogue Ale has a large assortment of the Oregon brewery brews and a noteworthy selection of guest beers. I'd love to recommend branching out for cocktails too, could recommend Comstock (scofflaw), Smuggler's Cove (painkiller IV), Tonga Room, Li Po's Lounge (chinese mai-tai; this place is a dive noteworthy for some filming of Big Trouble in Little China; Anthony Bourdain had an episode of the layover pass through here, fun place), I could go on. Frankly, you'd spend the entire trip drunk if you hit every noteworthy drinking location in the city.    As long as you get out of the typical tourist areas you're doing something right. Pass through the financial district during a weekday when it's populated. Check out Golden Gate park on a weekend, roaming through from Haight past conservatory of flowers, Japanese tea garden, De Young museum, just hanging out or exploring as interests call can be fun. Land's End is a good short hike.   One of the less leveraged features of the city is the availability of people interested in near anything. There are Meetups covering topics I'd not be able to find anywhere else. Skimming the list for interests that pertain to you could be of value. Hell, if you're going to be in Emeryville, look into what's going on around Berkeley for interesting speakers and events.   I'm still exploring after years in this city. Have fun."

Take your time going to the Turrell Skyspace in the sculpture garden.  I like to sit there for the whole 1-2 hours after sunset, but the BEST time is from about 20 to 40 minutes after sunset. This is when twilight is fading; the shift from day to night.  When the colors get really intense, try looking around the edges of the circle...as your eyes shift, watch what happens! You never know who will be in the skyspace with you. Often parents use it as a mere playroom for their kids. :( I've learned to take that as part of the art. Often at around the post-sunset 30 minute mark, when the colors are incredible, everyone in the room suddenly realizes that this is freakin' amazing and shuts up for a little bit. Sometimes people play music or sing there. The acoustics are awesome. (But terrible in the sense that you hear what anyone says, anywhere they are sitting!) Be sure to try standing on the marble circle in the center, and then speak or sing. I can't explain how it will sound to you!   If you, like me, enjoy art more with some knowledge of the science. Here are some of the things going on in your eyes/brain in the Skyspace:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_%28perception%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision   I may be there this Friday too!

Then after food you can get on MUNI all the way to the park. This way you avoid paying for parking.   I'm not much a foodie so I just looked at some of the Yelp reviews and they seem to be mixed.

As for the drive...it won't be too bad, based on the traffic I see when heading south, it could be good to take 280-19th Ave-GGP but instead of taking Park Presidio, cutting off in the park and taking 25th street through the richmond and heading on to the GG bridge via Lincoln Blvd."
AskSF,367swz,deadershoppingmalls,1 point,Sun May 17 01:14:43 2015 UTC,I can get to Millbrae BART with a short drive so I was considering that. Didn't even think of the ferry option!

Going down 25th and to Lincoln is ""street"" but I always find it preferable than park presidio anyway.   As for the ferry....I am slightly jealous of people that use it to commute.

AskSF,367kuf,stoneyloon,3,Sat May 16 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm probably qualified to answer this. My in-laws from Edinburgh are coming in a few weeks. They are completely radge and are leaving the bairns at home, so we'll probably be heavy malkied. (You see I'm practicing the lingo in advance!)  First piece of advice, since you're travelling around the city for a week, and then getting in a rental car, is to observe the driving habits during your pedestrian week. You'll note that we drive on the other side (har har) but you'll quickly also see that we have the daftest cunts behind the wheel. Turn signal left, car goes right. Stopped in the middle of the street staring at the phone. Swerve across 4 lanes to get to the freeway exit. Etc. Enjoy!  Okay, as far as SF tourist advice, you need to walk a lot and see a lot of neighborhoods and eat stuff you can't get elsewhere. That's my advice to everyone, but you walk-everywhere Scots are uniquely prepared for this. I won't recreate everything you can easily find on the google, but you have to walk thru the Mission (burritos, tacos), North Beach (pizza), Chinatown (dim sum) and/or Clement St (dim sum), the Tenderloin (dive bars, thai/vietnamese/middle eastern).  In your neighborhood, there is good mexican food (burritos and rice-beans-entree plates) and pupusas in a 4-block strip on Mission. You must eat pupusas and tamales while here. There's a pupusa place at 12 Persia (name escapes me) which is the best. The address is misleading -- it's about 25 meters E of Mission St on the South side of Persia.  For tamales I recommend La Palma at 24th/Florida. Speaking of which, 24th st, Mission st (from 16th to 24th) and Valencia (also 16th to 24th) are all must-do walks.  A lot of the cheap (i.e. most authentic) places to eat are cash-only.  You can go to fisherman's wharf and pier 39, but I'm telling you now that is a waste of time. Likewise Alcatraz -- it is a worthwhile and unique spot, but with less than a week you are wasting basically an entire day on this and need reservations in advance.  Layers. It gets bone-chilling-windy cold here, even in summer. I will point out here that my other Embra in-laws lived here for a while, in West Portal, which is one of the foggier neighborhoods. They were quite pleased when the job brought them back to edinburgh where it was warmer.  Sunscreen. Especially for you pale folk. You can get be freezing and get sunburned here at the same time, it's brilliant! Outside Lands is a great event for this.  If you're budgeting for at least one fancy meal, I recommend State Bird Provisions. It works well for a traveller since you can queue up at 4 pm or so. Search here if you want more instructions, I think I made a longer post about that a few months ago. Delfina, Flour+Water and Frances are other recommendations of mine.  Stairway walks. I would find a map on the google and just print it out and throw it in my backpack...as you're meandering around town there will often be a quality hidden stairway a few blocks away.  Ice Cream. Smitten, bi-rite, Humphry Slocombe, Mr&Mrs Miscellaneous all have their adherents. I patronize em all!  Fun or fancy drinks. I have only a couple of suggestions here as I'm a cynical cunt since I have owned a couple bars. Go to a tiki bar -- the best one in the city is Smuggler's Cove. Go to a bar with a view -- Top of the Mark (mark hopkins hotel), Starlight Room (sir francis drake hotel), bar at the marriot hotel at 4th/Market).  There you are in no particular order. Lastly, general safety -- just be street-wise. We are not a true late-nite city (a common and legitimate complaint), so when you're out in the wee hours, the miscreants per capita are a lot higher. And (really not trying to make you worry here, but I'd be remiss not to mention) there have been a couple of muggings within Outside Lands. A gang of guys will surround a blissed-out dancing lady and one by one start 'dancing' with her. In a minute they've got her surrounded in the crowd and then shake her down for phone and valuables before drifting away. A good blag really (sorry, that was more of an english word i suppose). Anyway, statistically very very unlikely, but just an example of keeping your street smarts on at all times."

We will try and fit in as many of the suggestions as possible. Pretty sensible when it comes to the being street-wise but any particular areas / neighborhoods we should avoid?

AskSF,367kuf,cunty_cuntington,2,Sun May 17 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Slightly worried about the fact we have a relatively long journey back from the festival at night and will definitely be drunk.   You and many many others. I think it's no cause for worry. Layers and patience are the top areas of concern at that moment.  Actually, I would look at the Muni maps in advance...you may have an advantage if you're going directly back to the excelsior from there. Bus routes 29/43/44 might be your ticket? (Going by memory here). Taking the streetcar (N) downtown, or uber/lyft are the things that are impossible leaving the festival unless you have some special magic.  There are no no-go area of SF during daylight hours. The tenderloin (and its extension 6th st) is the one sketchy area that you have reason to visit. If you do stay out drinking till 2 am at cinnabar or the gangway and are then the only people out on the street who don't have a crack pipe or hypodermic attached, then you have cause to worry. In that case, take a taxi rather than walk the gantlet down to Market st. Luckily, the other thing that's plentiful in the tenderloin is taxis, as it's the one neighborhood that's on the way to everywhere."

I will admit to general geographic ignorance of this quadrant before I started being 9-5 down here.   Anyway, I considered mentioning this, then left it out for simplicity's sake. There's 0.005% chance a visitor would stumble into the projects down here. In any case, it's been a nice eye-opener to discover a new neighborhood. Like a lot of 'bad' neighborhoods, the vast majority of folks are just normal dudes doing normal things.

You have no option to go back to the hotel and rest or to take your baby for a nap if they get over tired.   Can't tell from your post if you're flying in or driving but if you're flying you'd be better off not renting a car and using the $ for a hotel in the city...  Traffic is also an issue you can easily blow the better part of an hour in traffic on the Bay Bridge.
AskSF,3665tw,GrasponReality,2,Sat May 16 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's what I'm understanding is that going back to the hotel mid-day may actually be something we would want to do, and with traffic and whatnot, it's not exactly convenient.   We'll be hitting Alcatraz, the Wharf, etc. while there, so ultimately, just want to make sure we don't waste time on the bridge, but at the same time, being downtown at night isn't exactly what we're looking for.

Those are somewhat different experiences, and the relative costs reflect that. It's only 8 miles or so away, but that bridge is an obstacle in the mornings and evenings. You'll probably be more likely to end up going directly to the ""attractions"", while staying in town would probably lead you to chancing upon interesting things and seeing more because you aren't spending so much time traveling."

It really is a very walkable city, and such a good way to explore the various neighborhoods.  I personally don't take transit or taxis unless my destination is more than 2 miles away (aka 30 minute walk).  Shoot, factoring in waiting for busses/taxis, and getting stuck in traffic, I feel like this 'rule' actually saves me time. And this is all coming from an overweight, smoking, asthmatic.   Flip-flops are rubbish in SF, but I would think sneakers would be perfect. The real challenge finding non-athletic shoes that work with all the walking.  You will find yourself paying more attention to the construction of the shoe if/when you buy work shoes, boots, trendy stuff etc. Nothing worse than having a gorgeous pair of footwear that will look terrible after a couple weeks of San Francisco life.

Somewhat on the old fashion style as far as style goes, but well made.  If you want something more affordable, look for styles that have rubber soles and have things like shock absorption technology, removable insoles, flexibility (so they give when you walk) etc.  Or get any ole pair of cheap work shoes, and just change into them when you get to work.

There is an AC Transit monthly TransBay pass but it's $151, probably slightly more than BART fare would be.  You can get cash autoloaded to your Clipper card on a monthly basis for a $2 service fee, I think that's probably what a lot of people (me included) do. Just figure out about how much you'll be using on a monthly basis and set that up to autoload. If you'll be riding MUNI twice a day five days a week then it would also make sense to get a regular (non-BART) MUNI pass. That breaks even at 31 rides per month."

He did my first tattoo in January 2010 when he worked at a small shop in Redwood City and my second one in October 2011 when he was at Haight Ashbury Tattoo.   I believe this new place, Scholar Tattoo, is his shop that he opened in the last couple of years. He is a really nice mellow guy and made the both experiences that much more pleasant.   It sounds like this might be your first piece? As far as prices go, on /r/tattoo, price discussions aren't allowed and those comments are actively removed. I see it this way: you are paying for a lifelong piece of art (barring your skin catching fire or limb getting chopped off). Theoretically, let's say you pay $300 for a tattoo. You are 25 and you'll probably live to be 85 years old. So you'll have this on you every day of the rest of your life, hopefully for 60+ years. If you break down this cost, you see that it is the equivalent of paying about a penny per day to have that tattoo.   It costs what it costs. Any reputable, respectable tattoo shop will have documentation of many satisfied clients over the years, will be safe and reliable and make sure you are taken care of. And when you fall in love with an artist's style and you both come together to create a new piece, that to me is worth paying a higher price for."

Here's my $.02 about dating in california:   Women will have a (rightfully) distorted sense of mens' attractiveness in the dating pool. Lots of good looking, successful dudes out here, that's just reality. You gotta be on your game about dressing nicely, keeping in shape and learning how to to be a little smooth.  However, men in CA tend to be very immature. Flakey, non-committal, self-absorbed. This is your secret weapon. If you can ask an adult woman out on a date in a polite way, show up on time, be nice and act like a gentleman - the dating world will be your oyster.  Lastly, like any big city SF has a huge number of subcultures that can be difficult to find and join. The internet helps a lot - find a group with a bunch of strangers and go check it out. Then see my advice above. (FWIW there's an SF redditors group on the sidebar that's pretty active.)  Good luck!"
AskSF,35wmuf,bostonT,7,Sat May 16 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"Originally from Boston as well, and I fully agree.  My additional 2 cents:  I think it's not just brutal for men, it's brutal for women too. The area has lots of talented people who still find time to care about health and fashion here which means tough competition, but it's not just the men who are flakey...I found that ""kid in a candy store"" syndrome is common in both sexes when the threat of substitution abundant."
AskSF,35wmuf,ladydoesbad,6,Thu May 14 15:33:52 2015 UTC,Dudes are so flaky now. Maybe they always have been but I feel it was less apparent when I was younger.

AskSF,35wmuf,sigmaration,3,Thu May 14 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"I have lived in SF for 12 years, and I'm also from the midwest. I was in a relationship when I moved here, but then a single girl for several years. In that time, I met a lot of people through friends or on OK Cupid, but they were all either not interested, not right for me, just looking for a hookup (which, occasionally I was too) but mostly, just really flaky and emotionally distant. I dated one guy for over 6 months and he was still flaky -- took forever to answer my texts, tried to make/cancel plans at the last minute, and I was never truly sure how he felt about me.  I met my now-boyfriend of a year and a half on OK Cupid. I didn't do anything differently, it was just a matter of finding the right person for me. We clicked immediately, and he texted me goodnight when he got home and good morning the next day. I never doubted how he felt about me, and he always respected me and my time.  Dating is brutal. Finding the right person is magic."

AskSF,35wmuf,LPGreen,3,Thu May 14 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"First off, I love you. Now that's out of the way,    The idiom is usually written chomping at the bit, and some people consider this spelling wrong. But chomp can also mean to bite or chew noisily (though chomped things are often eaten, while champed things are not), so chomp at the bit means roughly the same as champ at the bit.  In fact, chomp, which began as a variant of champ, is alive in English while the biting-related sense of champ is dead outside this idiom, so it’s no wonder that chomping at the bit is about 20 times as common as champing at the bit on the web. Champing at the bit can sound funny to people who aren’t familiar with the idiom or the obsolete sense of champ, while most English speakers can infer the meaning of chomping at the bit.  Still, if you’re writing for school or for readers who are versed in English, champing at the bit is probably the safer choice.

AskSF,35rsbr,johnb0z,2,Tue May 12 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"The benefit of earthquake insurance is not the money you'd get to replace possessions, it's the money you'd get to relocate yourself if your building was substantially damaged. Obviously in this city moving into a new market rate apartment is going to be very expensive, but what about if a certain % of the available units have been taken out of commission due to damage? Now an already undersupplied market will be even more competitive.  I think it's only $10k-$20k your get from the insurance, but it would definitely be welcome.   That being said, this is still California and they build buildings knowing there will be earthquakes. How old is your building? Mine was built in '84 and is supposedly pretty seismically sound. I still have the earthquake insurance though, because I moved here from back East and the thought of the earth opening up and swallowing me whole is still terrifying. But is it truly worth the $140/year? Probably not in my case.   One more note: in an earthquake the damage is usually from fires, floods, etc. These fall under your renter's insurance, not the earthquake insurance. So make sure you have renter's insurance whether you go with the earthquake policy also or not."

That's a good reason for the insurance and a point that I didn't think of.  My building is only a few years old, so I'm sure it's seismically sound. I just don't know what to expect from a medium-sized quake that just shakes things up a bit, like if I'll have a bunch of broken stuff or not. I've never experienced it before, so I can only guess at what will happen. And even if I do have some broken stuff, will it total up to $750 (plus the price of the policy)?   Good point also on the damage usually being from something besides the earthquake itself.

We've had previous discussions about J1 visas here, but not with all the complications you seem to be having.  Craigslist has a sublets/temporary housing section that is probably your best resource for such housing.  1) Signing a lease for a year and crowding others into the same location may work.  It doesn't hurt to ask the landlord.  2) It's possible but it will be hard to work the arrangements out while working.  3) I would advise against working separately.  4) Check Tripadvisor for real world reviews of hotels, [hostels](http://sfhostels.org], etc.  5) See craigslist.

You've lived in bad areas before, and you've walked around and it isn't that bad.  End of story. Stop worrying.   Either be part of the San Francisco experience, or don’t.

In the last three weeks I've been hiking in Tilden Regional Park (beautiful lake), Redwood Regional Park (beautiful creek and redwoods), and China Camp State Park (hella views) and each one has been incredibly memorable.  Route 128 is a long favorite for how it crosses so many types of terrain.  In that area there's the postcard town of Petaluma, the hippie town of Sebastopol, and the mountain town of Guerneville with the fog rolling off the top of the trees.    Pacifica (Rockaway Beach), Half Moon Bay, Santa Cruz, Capitola for a few Norcal beach towns.   And there are the other urban neighborhoods like Burlingame's two downtowns, San Mateo, Grandlake and Temescal and Lake Merritt in Oakland, downtown Berkeley, and the sanitized San Jose.

I fucking love it. It's also cold, windy, and surprisingly very sunny for most of the time. They say there's fog, but I rarely ever seem to see it when I'm outside.  I fell in love with the Pacific Ocean. Ocean Beach, Lands End, Sutro Baths. Walk all along that area.   I fell in love with the hills/mountains of the city. Golden Gate Park's random lake on top of that hill (forgot name). Grand View Park. Tho a bit touristy, Twin Peaks for the amazing view. Equally amazing is on top of Bernal Heights (bonus points if you're a dog person because it's totally a dog park).   I fell in love with the quirkiness. Seward and Bernal concrete slides. Vermont St (because eff Lombard and it's touristy-ness. Rent a car and drive down Vermont St in Potrero). The Armory (kink.com anyone?). The Mission's graffiti streets (between 18-19th and Valencia, Balmy St off 24th St and all up and down 24th St). Castro because so gay and so awesome. Mission/Castro is great (and sad) to see old SF cultural neighborhoods clash with rent-hiking landlords feeding off tech boom kids.  I fell in love with the food. Shizen Izakaya in Mission (totally vegan sushi and hella delish). Pretty much any taqueria in Mission for burrito, tho SF taqueria may have won recently for best burrito. El Farrolito's is popular too.  Brunch in SF is very much a thing! Get reservations for Foreign Cinema now (I hear their brunch is one of the best). Or get to Nopa/Sweet Maple right when they open so you have a chance of getting a seat pretty quickly, otherwise expect 1-2 hour waits. Go to the Mission to Bi-Rite Creamery for some weird but delish ice cream and walk to Dolores Park and sit and enjoy watching people all around you.  These are my city recommendations.   Outside of that, there's Muir Woods (pre-8am is best), Pacifica and dat Taco Bell, driving down route 1 past Half Moon Bay and seeing the cliffs of Half Moon Bay. Alternatively, going down rt 84 then hit rt 1 North for take-your-breath-away view. Monterey Bay and Pebble Beach/17-mile-drive. Big Basin trail-walking. There's even this thing, you know. It's nothing big or anything but it's called Yosemite. You might not have heard of it, but, it's nearby. Could, like, go on hikes there. ;) Same with some small little place called Lake Tahoe. No big deal!  I hope your friend falls in love with SF, because it is amazing here. No regrets at all."

AskSF,35nftg,Krnk15,1 point,Mon May 11 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"If I tag off for the first and second ride of the month, will it make an additional charge? Essentially am I free to tag off on the end of all my trips?   General practice is to tag on and off for your first ride only. If you go past your normal zones during the week, you'll want to buy a paper zone upgrade. It's the dumbest thing, but Caltrain and Clipper don't work properly in the case that you want to go out of your zone. For example, if you have a Zone 1-3 pass, and want to go to Zone 4 and tag on in zone 1, you'll be charged a Zone 1-4 fare.   At the risk of being overly verbose - you mention tagging off, but not tagging on. The Clipper terminals are dumb. If you tag when you get off the train, but didn't tag before getting on, Caltrain will assume you're tagging on.    Does that mean if I have a zone 3 to 3 pass, I can use it from zone 1 to zone 5 on Saturday/Sunday without an additional charge? If so, do I have to tag off at the end?   Yes, you can use a Zone 3 to 3 pass on the weekends for any zone, though weekend Caltrain only runs zones 1 through 4 on weekends. No need to tag at all.  [Edited to add weekend clarification for zones]"

AskSF,35nftg,MattLaroche,1 point,Mon May 11 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  One thing you might want to consider - a 1 zone monthly is $73, a 2 zone monthly is $126 and includes a VTA (and SamTrans) monthly pass. Those monthly passes cost more more than the $53 addition. One thing I don't know, though, is what happens if you tag in in zone 3 and out in zone 3 on the first ride of the month, despite a pass being zones 3-2. People often buy at Walgreens to avoid this type of situation, and that also avoids the need to buy your pass online 3-5 days ahead of the first ride of the month."

AskSF,35m0g9,OuagaNoma,3,Mon May 11 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"My wife and I just went through this. We were looking for months online but you will have a hard time getting an apartment that way.   I definitely recommend to continue looking online though. This will help you see what you can get for your price range in various neighborhoods, that way when you do come out you will be able to look at apartments and know what's a reasonable price, etc.   My wife and I gave ourselves about 10 days to find an apartment and ended up taking one the first day we looked. We moved in the next day. Almost all apartments are available immediately so if you find one you might end up paying for the AirBnB and your apartment. We stayed with a relative in Sacramento while we were looking.   Don't get attached to any specific apartments you see online, but get a feel for the type of apartment you want and the neighborhood and something similar will probably be available when you come. Start making appointments to see them about a week before you come out. Be prepared with everything you need for applications as well (you can find some applications online that show you everything you need).   It sucks but you definitely have to be here to get an apartment. The landlords don't really care about your situation. If you aren't here to meet them and look at someone else will be. That being said, once you get here, getting an apartment can happen really quickly. (Be prepared to fork over between 5-10 K for first month's rent and security deposit though)."

Being the first in line with your application already filled out, a credit report in your hand, and your deposit check ready to go is the fastest way to secure an apartment. Most people listing on craigslist get FLOODED by people who want to rent the apartment, so showing up to the open house with all items ready will make you a desirable candidate.  I'd suggest renting a hotel or Airbnb for the first few weeks you're here, walking the neighborhood you want to be in, and going early to open houses.

Searching for ""best taco in SF"" will probably net hundreds of suggestions, most of them not wrong (and most of them in the Mission).  Personally I think the way to go is to eat tacos instead of burritos, because you can try a variety of other things for very cheap.    As for specific locations, Taqueria Cancun is a popular choice, as is La Taqueria (but they were recently named ""best burrito in America"" by 538, so there may be a (in my opinion unmerited) line.  I personally like Tortas Los Picudos for my tortas.  You also shouldn't overlook Little Chihuahua, which is not run by Mexicans (and thus gets a lot of sneering disapproval from people who demand authenticity), but they manage to make delicious (and not inauthentic) food all the same.    I would have said go to Little Saigon for some bahn mi or pho, as that is close to the Tenderloin and dirt cheap, but my understanding is that DC has an excellent Vietnamese scene.  Shalimar has good cheap Indian food.    Also, I can second Super Duper for a burger.  Yes, it's a burger, but it's pretty good."

AskSF,35m299,swollencornholio,2,Mon May 11 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"why have someone permanently for $1000 a month, when you can have guests for $200 a night?!   Because a $1000 a month property doesn't rent for $200 a night? And because there is far more overhead managing an Airbnb property - supposedly, it has to be cleaned between each guest, you have to constantly arrange to get keys etc. to new guests, and any day that the place isn't occupied you're losing money.  Airbnb isn't a straight-up replacement for having long-term tenants. Especially outside of downtown, it probably makes more sense to stick with regular rentals. Downtown though, I'm sure people make a killing on Airbnb."
AskSF,35m299,archimidas,1 point,Mon May 11 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"As a landloard, you can also adjust your asking price on the fly.  Long term rentals are covered by rent control laws, AirBnB is not.

He offers to set me up to marry his cousin back in Lahore. As were passing Potrero hill I ask, ""what airport are we going to?"" I laugh a little bit and he drops me off at 16th and Mission. I give him 20 bucks since I can't remember ever specifying which airport and refuses to accept the whole $30 fare on the meter.

Significant delays? Bart website, you sick pups, 10 minutes are significant delays? Haha!  Bart gets me to the airport in 35 mins. The oak to Bart connector is automatically added into the Bart fare, I think it was three bucks extra, but hard to say.   TL;DR: Total cost: $20.00 to Haji to get me to the Bart (and possibly for matchmaking me to my new bride) $10.15 for Bart from 16th and Mission to Oakland, plus the new Bart-Oak connector, which was the most glorious thing ever after years of crappy AirBart nightmares and however many millions it cost the Feds, the State and Taxpayers, I thank you all-- that thing rocked.

AskSF,35bzah,wellvis,3,Fri May 8 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"They don't provide public ones, but definitely do provide private ones. Any visitor is going to have to sign an NDA, and they are very likely restricted to certain areas of the offices."

Many of them require you to travel outside of the city, but Pica Pica is amazing (and in the city). You will be able to eat fried chicken. Seriously, try the crispy chicken arepa.

Keeping part of the kitchen bread-free to the extent they would need to for people with severe gluten allergies is probably prohibitive.

AskSF,35buux,kebabmybob,1 point,Fri May 8 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"Most of the hotels are clustered in two places - Union Square (downtown, also where most of the shopping and public transit center is located), and Fisherman's Wharf, near to the north edge of the city and near Pier 39 (and a more touristy area).  Personally I prefer Union Square.  There are more things to do and it's a more central location.  I normally recommend reading the real world reviews on Tripadvisor's SF section to get an idea of what hotels are out there and what you can afford.

We have a lot of different styles of food available in SF - any particular likes/dislikes? Perhaps you mean the Stewart Street Slides. Rice A Roni is made in San Leandro.  Your best bet for a bulk purchase would be one of the Smart and Final stores (probably the one on Seventh Avenue in the Richmond). Try Land's End for a good nature trail. You can find sharks north of here on the Marin Coast, possibly along the SF coast (watch for riptides).  I think you'd have to rent a zip line, though."

The slides are in the Castro and in Golden Gate Park. I second Land's End for hikes, but there are numerous great short walks in the city too. If you'd like to get out of the city for a bit, there's a bus shuttle to Muir Woods that departs from the Sausalito Ferry landing (so you get to ride the ferry and see pretty trees. Surf and Turf!).

THE LOW WILL CONTINUE TO DESTABILIZE THE    ATMOSPHERE TODAY WHICH WILL LEAD TO MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS    THROUGH THE DAY.   My weather junkie analysis: an area of low pressure came in from the north, riding the back side of the huge ridge of high pressure off the Pacific coast that's been directing storms up and away from Northern California for the past few winters. The jet stream is just to the east of the Bay Area today, which is why we're seeing cloudy skies and showers inland but not over the Peninsula and showers moving from north to south (lows spin counter-clockwise)."

The SFMTA's system of buses and streetcars should get you everywhere you need to go.  Without knowing your budget or when you'll be in town, it's hard to suggest any specific places.  Most of the hotels are located in one of two areas - Union Square (closer to the center of town and shopping) and Fisherman's Wharf (closer to the waterfront and tourist attractions such as Pier 39, etc.).  Hint: If you want to visit Alcatraz, get your tickets as soon as possible.  They frequently sell out weeks in advance.  Please search the FAQ and Archive and/or top questions for more suggestions.

Muni trains, specifically.  If you want a nice neighborhood where the kids won't be exposed to the bad parts of being in a big city as much, perhaps look in Hayes Valley or the Castro.  Both will get you downtown within 10 minutes on a train, or are a $7 Uberpool ride away from anywhere in the city."

There are other casinos around the area, but not really sure if any of them are in a particularly good location.  Some casinos have cheap bus service where they also give you $20 in ""Free play"", but I've never actually done it so I don't know what the terms are.  There's also the airport express, which leaves from SFO, and is fairly expensive.  And, instead of taking golden gate transit all the way, you could take the Larkspur Ferry and then get on golden gate transit.  It probably won't save you a lot of time, but it will be a lot more scenic than riding the bus, although it is a commuter ferry and travels pretty fast, so you don't really get that much time on it."

I have created my own custom travel guide with over 250 web pages which covers everything of interest in the city. I added some extensive sections on technology companies, theaters, and bookstores.   I definitely want to visit North Beach and buy books at City Lights Bookstore. I also plan to visit the Beat Museum and relax at Washington Square Park. There are lots of famous cafes in North Beach.  Chinatown may not interest you since Australians are closer to Asia. But I plan to visit the Chinese Culture Center and the Chinese Historical Society of America.  South of Market is where all the tech companies are located. This neighborhood is not very interesting but I want to locate the headquarters of several tech companies.   Japan Center is another neighborhood where I plan to spend a half a day. You probably won't find Japantown very interesting, but I want to see a few Zen temples. This might be as close to Japan as I ever get!  And finally I plan to explore the Haight-Ashbury area if only for its historical significance. But there won't be much to do there except shopping at bookstores and record stores and eating at a restaurant.   Overall I will be avoiding many top tourist attractions to focus more on neighborhoods and to see local points of cultural interest."

Honestly SF was more a detour for us in our planning as we don't really know a lot about the City itself beyond Alcatraz and the GGB. Many people I've spoken with more so talk about the architecture as their drive to visit but honestly that's not a big deal for us.

And I've read a lot about San Francisco over the years. I used to read a few of the Beat poets during my intellectual phase so it will be thrilling to visit City Lights Bookstore. I've also read a few books about the San Francisco Zen Center so I want to see that. The hippies were before my time but I've heard a lot of the 60s music over the years so I might as well visit Haight-Ashbury.  I also made a list of all the movies I've seen that were filmed in San Francisco, 37 in all. Movies often manage to mythologize a city.

You could do much worse than to spend time walking around Valencia and Mission Streets.  Don't miss 826 Valencia - the best independent pirate supply shop on the West Coast, Tartine Bakery, and/or Bi-Rite Ice Cream. The Haight is actually two neighborhoods, separated by a few blocks of housing.  The upper Haight (Haight-Ashbury) is famous for its history as the center of the hippie experience.  Now mostly thrift stores, bars, shops and other tourist attractions, it still has one of the largest and best record shops (Amoeba Records), and is one of the top tourist attractions.  It also has a seedy side, with quite a few street people.  The Lower Haight has a few great beer bar (Toronado, Mad Dog In the Fog), some more shops, and a more local feel than the upper Haight. The Inner Sunset (9th Avenue and Irving) has a more Asian feel, with some stores, restaurants (try the chicken wings at San Tung), and an easy walk into Golden Gate Park's museums and the Japanese Tea Garden."

It's administered by county so you should check with the health department of the county you're in  http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/pages/fdbcottagefood.aspx
AskSF,3545vk,GrasponReality,1 point,Thu May 7 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"That underground market by foragesf will probably be back soon.  They did a Kickstarter for ForageKitchen.com  When the Oakland kitchen is built you can make those sauces there, at a licensed commercial kitchen.  My guess is this is a prelude to the return of that underground market.  The purpose of the new kitchen seems to be providing a place where people can get started with a specialty food product and perhaps be successful with it as a personal business."

It was astoundingly expensive (25k all in with followups) but we knew that going in.  Their quality of care and followup care was top notch.  I will say for the price they have a damn nice coffee machine and very clean bathrooms which made me feel a LITTLE better abotu the situation, lol... their parking was annoying though- get the pass from inside to use for the garage.   Front desk staff is kind of hipster/cool for school, could take a pass on that... but what else do you expect in that hood.    Anyway, it's a great organization, just PRICY.  But for advanced practice/specialty vet care, outside of UC Davis, you won't find superior vet care in the Bay Area.   For cheaper more mundane things (knee surgeries?) I recommend Dr Richard Schwach at Avenues Pet Hospital in the Sunset, Dr Schwach is an experienced, amazing, old school and awesomely trained surgeon who has done it all.   He has actually trained in neurosurgery too, just doesn't have the equipment that the SFVCA does.

It's like science: you make a hypothesis, then investigate it. My hypothesis is that Parks and Rec authorities apply rules arbitrarily and too broadly. I'm looking for examples of people who have had contact with Parks and Rec.  What I'm trying to do here is gather evidence. I want to hear from people who have been shut down, get their stories, and see if it fits into a larger pattern.  Of course, there's the whole issue of whether it's possible to remain completely un-biased, and whether that's even the best thing. In general, my sympathies lay with the little guy — here, people who are being shut down while trying to enjoy our public parks.   Of course, I'm talking to Parks and Rec and the city, too.   ""Fun police"" is of course loaded language, but it gets the point across.

AskSF,34z0iz,wellvis,3,Tue May 5 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"Now I may be wrong, but you're still being really biased going into this.

AskSF,34z0iz,wellvis,5,Tue May 5 22:25:09 2015 UTC,"I think the giveaway line is this:   ...I'm working on a story that frames SF Parks and Rec as the Fun Police.   If you presented your story in an unbiased way, I'd mostly likely read it and feel whatever sense of outrage you're looking for.  Based on the description of what you're trying to write about, I'd think your story would be biased against the SF Parks and Recreation Department, who are trying to do a difficult job with limited resources.  What alternatives would you present as solutions to the problem(s) you want to write about?"
AskSF,34z0iz,hashblunt,-4,Tue May 5 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"In the end, I'm trying to clear up confusion that exists between park-goers and the park authorities.   Since SF Parks and Rec does have limited resources, I wondered why they spending their time and money shutting down hammocks and slacklines, (which most reasonable people would probably agree are appropriate in a park setting.)  Having read through the Park Code, I can see that neither hammocks or slack-lines are expressly mentioned.   I actually have been in contact with the Parks and Rec department, and they said their main concerns about slacklines and hammocks are 1. safety and 2. the trees.  In the end, if the hammock-lovers and slackliners could show that they're not endangering anyone and that they're not harming the trees, perhaps those two activities could be allowed in our parks."
AskSF,34z0iz,emizeko,5,Tue May 5 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any confusion on the part of the park authorities.  They're trying to preserve the trees and park for the use of all, not just those who feel entitled to hang things on trees.   I hope you can make your case in a neutral report rather than starting from an assumed position and adjusting the facts to fit your story."
AskSF,34z0iz,sfryder08,4,Tue May 5 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the Rangers are using the same reasoning to ""shut down"" hammocks and slack lines as they would for skateboarders doing tricks over the stairs or down ledges. A deft skater could do anything over the stairs without damaging property or hurting others, just as a deft slack liner would be able to set it up without harming the tree. Theres also the chance of the skater/slack liner injuring themselves on city property that the Rangers have to worry about.  I can peacefully drink a beer in Dolores and clean up my trash but not everyone can or does, so I don't find it unreasonable when they don't happen to look the other way."

AskSF,34uf3j,Brandonjoe,6,Mon May 4 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"First off, good judgement for not renting a car!  Second, there's no way to save money, but public transportation is relatively inexpensive.  Assuming you're staying in San Francisco, Muni is 2.25 and the pass is good for 2 hours for free rides after.  BART is 1.85.  If you pay in cash, make sure to get a transfer slip from the bus driver.  If you enter a bus without a pass, you must pay in cash, exact change.  You can buy passes in the Muni stations.    There is a Clipper card, which is reloadable, but it costs $5, none of which is refundable, and probably not worth it to get two for a weekend trip.  It provides no discounts.  Use the Google Maps app and select public transportation to see the best pubtrans route.  Lyft and Uber are great.  Uber will get you anywhere in the city now, if you use Uber Pool, for $7 (max 2 riders and you may have to share the car with other riders.)  Lyft will get you all around the northeast quadrant of the city for $4 for 2 riders if you get picked up at one of their ""Hot Spots"" if you use Lyft Line.  Again, you will have to share.  From the airport, Uber Pool is only $15.  That is less than two BART fares and twice as fast.  Lastly, Welcome and enjoy your time.  If you let us know where you're staying and where you want to travel to, we may be able to give more tips."
AskSF,34uf3j,TheAntiPedantic,2,Mon May 4 17:38:23 2015 UTC,"This is excellent info thanks!   We are staying in Russian Hill, and we are planning on see the normal tourist attractions, Chinatown, Lombard, fisherman's wharf, Alcatraz, Golden Gate State Park. Monday evening of our visit we will be going to a Giants game ( pretty excited about that). How walkable is the city?"
AskSF,34uf3j,TheAntiPedantic,3,Mon May 4 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Extremely walkable.  From Russian Hill, I would recommend walking to Fisherman's Wharf, then from Fisherman's Wharf, walking down Columbus to see North Beach and Chinatown or continuing from Fisherman's Wharf to Embarcadero to the Alcatraz tour.  Either route is generally downhill/flat (which means the reverse is uphill.)  The Giants game is probably 2.5 miles from Russian Hill, so it depends on how much walking you want to do, but walking from Russian Hill to the ballpark is downhill/flat.  Then, you take a Lyft/Uber back because you will be cold by the end of the night and not up for a long, sloping uphill walk.  Golden Gate park is pretty far and I would probably take public transportation there to leave energy to talk around once you're in.  It's huge.  There's a great neighborhood just south of the park and Museums, centering at 9th and Irving.  Many cute bars and restaurants, and a mostly local crowd.  Park Chow would probably be my favorite but there are a bunch of great ones.  I suggest walking there when you leave the park.  It also puts you right on a Muni train line."

AskSF,34uf3j,Endur,2,Tue May 5 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow Texan! I totally understand the lack of public transportation experience.   TheAntiPedantic gave you all the cheap options in the city, but personally, I'd just download Lyft and take Lyft Lines (shared rides) everywhere. I think the max charge is about $8 for two riders, which is a little more expensive than Muni at $4.50 for two, but you'd save a bunch of time and you'd be able to focus on doing what you want instead of the bus system.   I would recommend walking whenever possible. I love walking in San Francisco, there's so much to see and there's a lot going on. The hills will wear you out but that's part of the fun. Grab some beer/wine and do a lunch hike through Golden Gate Park. Also, if you want to add more touristy things to your list, definitely check out Fort Point. It's an old military fort that has a great view of the bottom of the Golden Gate Bridge.   Also, avoid walking through the Tenderloin at night, it can get a little crazy around there"

For many, the discount almost covered the renter's insurance. The biggest thing is you want to pay extra to get your stuff replaced at current value. Also if you have any nice high tticket items, like expensive jewelry, you will probably only be covered for a portion. You can get another policy to cover them. If you have a decent agent, they should be able to walk you through your options."

AskSF,34oq9l,polybius2,13,Sun May 3 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"Pedal bike? There is no pedestrian/cycle path over the bay bridge. It's not possible, you need to use Bart.  Motorbike? I see plenty."
AskSF,34oq9l,critters,7,Sun May 3 03:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can't bike the whole way (yet! But it'll be several years before finishing the Bay Bridge bike path even looks like a possible reality). You can still take advantage of your bike, though. Here are your options:   Bike + BART. Pros: BART is familiar territory for most people, runs frequently enough that you don't really have to worry about the schedule (unless you work very late nights or very early mornings), and it's convenient to many downtown locations. Cons: If you work normal business hours, BART may be too crowded for your bike when you need to take it. If you have a folding bike, that could help a little. Bike + Transbay bus. Pros: Transbay buses pick up in places in the East Bay that aren't served by BART, they're more comfortable than BART, they're more reliable than BART. Cons: Sometimes the bus may run out of spaces for bikes by the time it gets to your stop, the schedule might not work for you. [This is my preferred method when the schedule works for me.] Bike + ferry. Pros: The ferry is comfortable and fun, and there's plenty of room for bikes. Cons: The schedule might not work for you. [This is my preferred method when I'm in Oakland and/or have lots of extra time to bike to the ferry from Berkeley.] Bike + (BART?) + bike shuttle from Macarthur BART. Pros: Not many, unless Macarthur BART is just super-convenient for you. Well, it's also cheap. Cons: Only runs during peak commute hours, bike spaces fill up quickly. Transit method of your choice to SF + BikeShare in SF. Pros: You don't have to deal with getting your bike to SF, or finding a place to lock it up while it's there. Cons: BikeShare currently only covers downtown SF (no stations in the Mission or the Castro, for example), the bikes are heavy, a BikeShare membership costs money.  Bike to BikeLink station or bike lockers + BART. Pros: You have a safe, reliable place to store your bike in Oakland, and don't have to deal with getting your bike onto BART. Cons: You are without your bike on the SF side.    So it really depends on where you live and where you work in relation to transit, and what you're comfortable with.   As for traffic, biking on the SF side can definitely be challenging if you aren't used to it, but it's getting better. Check out the Google Maps bicycle layer for bike lanes and bike-friendly routes, and follow the SF Bike Coalition for updates on improvements.   (Edit: Formatting, words, added bike shuttle option.)"

AskSF,34oq9l,killdeviljill,3,Mon May 4 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you can't.  You can only bike on the Oakland side of the Bay Bridge up to Treasure Island.  That's the new part, and it has a pedestrian and cycle path.  The SF-side of the bridge can't be biked or walked over - it's just lanes of motor traffic with no pedestrian/cycle path.  Edit: Actually, if you're enterprising and really want to work those calves, you could do what this guy did."
AskSF,34oq9l,DoNotLickToaster,3,Sun May 3 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"You cannot ride across the bay bridge. Take the ferry from Jack London Square. It is by far the most bike-friendly way to get to SF from the east bay. BART is a good backup plan for after the ferries stop running, but I would never use it at rush hour. The trains are too full for bikes at those times.  If you don't need your bike in SF, another good option is to ride to a BART station with BikeLink lockers. These cost about 25¢ per day and are very secure."

What I recommend is that you move into something temporary and house hunt in person. Otherwise, fly in for a weekend, sign a lease with an apartment complex, the move in when you get here."

First question, do you mean really mean liqueurs, which are typically flavored in some way, 10 - 40% alcohol, and mostly either sweet or medicinal tasting? Or do you mean liquor, which encompasses liqueurs, neutral spirits (gin, vodka), whisky/whiskey/bourbon, plus a lot of other stuff?  In any case, I have a suggestion. There are businesses where you can try all of these things in affordably small amounts. They even serve it to you in a glass!

AskSF,34h0o0,ben1sandler,6,Fri May 1 02:03:09 2015 UTC,"To start, you should wiggle both directions for a while.  That steep downhill on Grove isn't very good for beginners, especially with Octavia in the way with a lot of vehicle deadlocks at the crossings during rush hour.  Octavia and Market crossing usually clears out and has no deadlocks, and also has a physical barrier separating the bike lane.  Van Ness crossing has a separated lane as well.  The steep uphill is probably difficult, and you should take the wiggle until wiggle feels like a breeze going up.  It's a 0.5 mile detour each way, but it's the safest and the least difficult route you can take to learn.  I've biked every work day in 2014 between upper Haight and Financial district, and Market st + wiggle combo is the safest and the easiest both ways, even if the distance is a bit further.  I also had option to go on Page (parallel to Haight), but I found the same problem as I described about Octavia, and had some close calls.  Also, SF Bicycle Coalition gives free safety classes that you should take instead of taking a ""monkey-see, monkey-do"" approach.  A lot of bad examples out there, like running red lights and biking/stopping on crosswalks.  Also, NEVER cross muni tracks at anything below 45 degree angle.  I've seen more than my share of broken wrists and ankles on Market st..."
AskSF,34h0o0,kosmos1209,2,Fri May 1 03:39:05 2015 UTC,"Wiggle's out of the way, and the steep getting to it is just as bad - if not worse - from Steiner and Hayes. Octavia intersection at Grove isn't bad. Wiggle + walking might make sense on the way home, but probably doesn't on the way in."
AskSF,34h0o0,MattLaroche,1 point,Fri May 1 04:46:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  I used to take almost the same route from my place in the Upper Haight--I would go by Alamo Square on my way down to the Ferry Building and ride straight down Fulton to City Hall and Market Street.  Going down is fine as long as you're careful--ride your brakes and don't run red lights.  Coming home, though, you'll want to take the Wiggle--it's so much easier."
AskSF,34h0o0,meelar,1 point,Fri May 1 14:37:25 2015 UTC,"OP, however, lives on the other side of one of the hills (basically at the top of the hill) that the Wiggle is trying to avoid.  Basically, /u/ben1sandler, you're going to have to go uphill on the way home, and it's going to be a matter of least annoying."
AskSF,34h0o0,MattLaroche,3,Fri May 1 17:00:03 2015 UTC,"I live near Grove & Webster, and you don't need to jump to Natoma to get to where you're going on Market. The timing of the light on Larkin means you will get to Hyde & Market with Hyde getting a red light. You can scoot over to the left to Market safely.   If you see a big guy on a green city bike on Grove, say hi. My name's obvious.  For safety after dark on the way home, Polk to Grove does make sense. I take McAllister, but it's not a particularly great route west, I would only recommend it to confident cyclists.  I'd be happy to ride in to work with you a couple times until you're confident, drop me a line."
AskSF,34h0o0,MattLaroche,2,Fri May 1 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Wiggle is mostly useful for going west to avoid some of the hills.  Personally I'd take Fulton going east instead of Grove, follow it until it ends at Franklin, hang a left, and then Mcallister or Golden Gate until Market.  Mcallister might be calmer than Golden Gate, though the traffic lights east of city hall are a bit annoying.    Page going east is a bit more calm, though it gets a bit dicey near Octavia."

Not sure why GMaps is being funky about taking you straight down Market, which is what the rest of us do.  The unknown for me is that section nearer your house, because of the pretty steep incline. I would personally end up walking the bike for the last 4 blocks. Living on top of a hill sucks. I also don't know how sketchy your specific blocks are, but I can't imagine it's be any less safe than walking or Muni."

AskSF,34cxtu,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"Android lawn statues:       The Android lawn statues are a series of large plastic statues at the Googleplex (Google's headquarters) in Mountain View, California, currently located at 1981 Landings Drive. They are based on the code names for versions of Google's Android mobile operating system, which are named after desserts. These statues were originally located in front of Building 44, where the Android development team had its offices. However, they were moved to their present location a few blocks away (at some point before October 19, 2014), perhaps because the Android development team was no longer in Building 44. The Android statues remain a tourist attraction, where visitors come to take photos, though they receive considerably fewer visitors now that they are less centrally located.

It's also irrationally selfish to have an animal companion when your housing isn't nailed down for the forseeable future. You do not have a car (luckily, you won't need one in SF) You should be able to find a passable room in SF or a nicer room outside of SF for around $1000/mo.   Still, $12,000 will constitute some 30% of your take home pay, and you're not guaranteed to find a place that inexpensive.  Make a budget.  Are you good with following a budget?

AskSF,346aev,paulconroy415,13,Tue Apr 28 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"The Haight isn't the same as the storied version that grew out of the 60s. Hard drugs, cops, city politics and gentrification have transformed it to something else entirely. I wouldn't use the same word, but /u/trying_to_care hit it pretty close with calling it, ""a caricature.""   There is a vibrant tourist trade in the haight, and the shops catering to that market definitely purport to be a part of wacky and wonderful haight st, but half of them are new, having replaced other wacky shops that replaced others before them.   There are still bohemian types, but they're much more cloistered (and usually only living in rent-controlled flats). There still are communes, but they are far fewer and aren't as unreserved or lively as what I've read about the 60s. The hippies have grown old. There are still a number around, but I don't see them too often. There's definitely a 60+ tie-dye brigade that comes out at the few annual street fairs/events.  The phenomenon of youth escaping overbearing and tightly-wound (or abusive) families still exist. But San Francisco has changed, so the beatniks and the hippies are no more. The Haight isn't as welcoming as it once was; it has become pay to play. But the disenfranchised youth still come. And as I've understood and witnessed it, they become gutter punks.  Lots of tourists will say, ""look at the hippies,"" but these kids are gutter punks. They are homeless, dirty, angry, needy, prideful, unabashed, jovial, desperate, sad, sweet, violent, and really hard to summarize as a whole. Lots turn to sex work or other acts of desperation. A great many have pets, which is really sad to see, but I wouldn't begrudge someone down on their luck a little bit of companionship. Which is also why they usually travel in packs. Some are voluntarily homeless. For some, that's better than their alternatives.   Tons of gutter punks live in and around Buena Vista Park in Upper Haight and trek from and to the park as the sun rises and sets. An older and typically mentally ill set of homeless live in Golden Gate Park, which is pretty dangerous for homeless youth, so Buena Vista offers a nearby bastion. I live across the street from Buena Vista, and don't find these kids to be threatening or even much of a nuissance, but I'm a male of an imposing stature, so I feel generally safe in any surrounding. I'd say the worse they do normally is ask for your leftovers every time you pick up takeout. There can be aggressive panhandling or taunting/catcalling later on in the night when some get fucked up, but the bad eggs give everyone a bad name.    There are whole gradients, but I would say there are three major groups of young people moving to SF: hipsters, yuppies, and techworkers. All have means of supporting themselves. The hipsters are closest to hippies - they have generally progressive values, eat organic food, and have counter-culture tendencies. Some do, but I wouldn't say as a group they have the same activist or one-love tendencies.  Hipsters traditionally flock to the Mission. But Lower Haight (awesome neighborhood), Tenderloin (careful going out alone at night), and various neighborhoods in Oakland (recent targets for gentrification) all support hipster populations.  TL;DR: No. Yes. Well, kinda.   Do you identify as a hippie and are looking for a good place to live? Most SF neighborhoods have a lot to offer, but I would recommend starting with Upper/Lower Haight, NOPA, Hayes Valley, Mission as a top 5 based on personal preference and a hippie sensibility."

There is a ton of free parking (get there in the morning) and some places like The Japanese Tea Garden and the SF Botanical Garden have free admission when you get there early enough.  The elevator at the DeYoung Museum is free and has almost unparalleled views of the city.  The Conservatory, Tea Garden, DeYoung Museum and California Academy of the Sciences are all very close together.  It's also super nice just to wander around and explore the park.  It's best to visit on a weekday morning.  Many attractions are closed on Mondays.  Since you're going to Alcatraz anyway, be sure to visit the Ferry Building which has some great food and fun shops.  There is a crowded but nice farmer's market on Saturdays with many interesting food booths.  If you're up to it, Coit Tower is in walking distance.  The gardens on the way to the top of the hill are beautiful and there's an incredible view once you get to the top.  They charge admission to go to the top of the building but you don't have to do that.  Just to warn you, there are up to 454 steps to get up there (the way we walk it).  Parking is virtually non-existent, I wouldn't bother trying to drive to Coit Tower.  If parking near the Ferry Building on the weekend, use the garage at Howard & Spear St.  It's $6 for 4 hours.  Do not exceed 4 hours.    July is not exactly summer weather in San Francisco.  If you stick to the bayside, it's more likely to be sunny and clear.  The ocean-side coast is almost guaranteed to be foggy, particularly in the morning."

SF is an acceptable acronym/abbreviation.  Alcatraz is really touristy. A lot of our landmarks are. Just food for thought, but do you want to see the San Francisco that other tourists see, local favorites, a mix of both? Let us know your tastes, and what kind of thing you're looking for. You can live here for years and still be surprised.  I assume you'll want some romance as it's a honeymoon. A day exploring North Beach on foot (and visiting Coit Tower for a ridiculous, if touristy, unique view) followed by dinner at a nice italian restaurant should be on your list.

That said, working with the right therapist for you is really important - I saw quite a few therapists with whom I didn't work well before finding one who is a good fit, so I would encourage you to keep looking if the first person you see doesn't feel right.  Personally, I have found drama therapy to work best for me. It has nothing to do with being an actor or even acting at all - it's just a set of techniques that help you more deeply understand and engage with the different aspects of your life and yourself. I know many of these drama therapists personally, and they do amazing work: http://www.nadta.org/what-is-drama-therapy/find-a-drama-therapist/find-therapist-by-state/california-drama-therapists.html  I hope everything works out for you!

AskSF,342l6w,sorta_gay,3,Mon Apr 27 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"I used to sell many of these tours.  All the non-stop bus tours are essentially the same (in that they go to the same locations and have a similar format) and your experience varies widely depending on the driver of your tour.  There is no company that stands atop all the others in terms of service.    There are a couple gimmicky tours - the Duck Tour where you go in the water (chop permitting) and the Safari tour where you go in a theatre-seating open bus.  That one stops at an expensive deli for lunch.  The Safari tour used to also be the tour for ""non tourists"" which was very uncomfortable - he'd take people to Hunter's Point...those people are poor, they're not animals in a zoo, so uncool.  The hop on and off tours have flightly different stops but all also go to about the same places.  I like these because you can explore...but for the price I'd take the bus.  You don't get narration with the hop-ons (unless they've changed) so their whole business is basically a shadow bus system for people afraid of public transit.  IMHO not worth it, but that's me.  One I really like, which may or may not be more expensive depending on the people, is the GoCar tours.  Each car seats two people, and has a GPS-enables tour.  You can choose from I think three different routes, or go your own route.  There is no restriction except time.  The last time I sol City tours they were $55 a person, so at about $100 per car, the Go Cars are cheaper for the same amount of time (or more).  There are a TON of options out there though and I haven't sold for a while.  If they are interested in a specific neighbrohood, the guided walking tours are good to great for that.  One thing, buy online NOT at the vendors on the Wharf.  They'll try, hustle you into a time share presentation."

AskSF,33znwh,AvatusKingsman,7,Mon Apr 27 09:41:08 2015 UTC,Choosing the friendly interaction is never the wrong choice. The point is that a voucher for coffee or hamburgers is neutral friendly as opposed to the harmful friendly that cash might be to an addict or the get-a-job!-style hurtful unfriendly that some people might throw around.  And no one's going to kick a habit on an empty stomach. Don't be an asshole.
AskSF,33znwh,UnkleRuckus420,11,Mon Apr 27 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"You clearly have good intentions, but I think you are incorrect about the vouchers being somehow more neutral than cash - everything of any value gets traded on the street, and free food is already widely available and is the least exciting thing you could offer. The chance of the guy you give the voucher to actually using the voucher for food is much lower than him just selling for a quarter of the value to somebody and then putting the cash proceeds from the sale in his rock fund. Source: I speak with people who are or have recently been on the street pretty much every day. You are absolutely correct though - these folks are dehumanized every day and that friendly contact is very valuable, but you can get most of the way there with a friendly smile and hello, or actually buying them a cup of coffee and putting it in their hand and talking to them for a minute. McDonalds vouchers are just cash with a few hoops to jump through - putting anything of value in the hands of an addict is subsidizing and perpetuating their addiction."

You could totally bike over the bridge to that point, but going to the top of the headlands may be much.

Hike down to the beach, take great photos, run around naked, put back on your clothes, hike back up, then Proceed to the bridge.  Follow other bikers, cross the bridge, ride up to top of headlands, take great photos, then head back down and back across the bridge to presidio.

I used to own one they they are decent for the city. They have a triple up front so you'll have plenty of gears to slog up the hills and they're cheap enough to not be a theft magnet.  If you are an absolute beginner to bike maintenance or classic bikes it can be tough to figure out whether the used ones are a good deal. The upside of a used bike is that you can get a really nice riding bike for well within your price point. I'm currently riding a 1988 Bridgestone RB-1 and it has been great.   In most cases a cheap bike + a decent u lock will protect you. I recommend this Kryptonite set.   Whatever you do, please avoid department store bikes.

To add to this: it's not just an issue of big boxes vs small companies/""support-your-local-business"".  Bikes don't arrive to your local store fully assembled.  The quality of your bike depends in large part on the skill of the person who put it together, and your local full-time bike shop employee tends to have a lot more expertise than your average department store worker.

A great way to meet some neighbors is to go to a gallery opening.  These are ""open houses"" showing new work, and there's some in your neighborhood nearly every night.  Check out this Google Calendar for upcoming openings. Some of my favorites are 1AM SF - 1000 Howard St, which specializes in graffiti, and Gray Area Arts - 2665 Mission St, which frequently has great shows.  Etiquette: say hi to the person at the door, look at some art, if you want a drink put a $5 bill in the plastic cup at the bar table and take a beer or pour yourself a cup of wine (there's no one ""selling"" drinks because they don't have a liquor license).

However ""best nearby coffee"" will depend on your taste, and while Sightglass is very thoughtfully roasted and expertly prepared by great people, if you don't like the trend toward lighter, more floral/citrusy coffees, it may not be your cup of... well, you know. Equator has just opened up an excellent flagship cafe on 7th and Market, and they have more balanced coffees. Plus tasty homemade sodas and nibbly food things! You'll notice a coffee shop much closer to you, called Ma'velous. Don't go there. They have a gorgeous espresso machine and carry beans from great roasters, but the beans are almost always stale and the quality of their drinks has gone down drastically since they opened.   Huckleberry Bicycles is close by, too and a great place to get a city bike if you didn't bring one with you, or for accessories and repairs if you did. It's my favorite bike shop in a city full of pretty awesome bike shops. If you're not used to living in a city with a high bike theft rate, be sure to ask them about best locking practices. (Didn't bring a bike and don't think you'll want one? Your choice, of course, but it's soooo much easier than dealing with Muni or driving.)  I will add to the food list:    Alta - Really fantastic food, cocktails, and wine. The menu has a range of dishes in a range of sizes, so you can have just a nibble or a full meal or anything in between.  Moya - Surprisingly excellent Ethiopian given the reasonable prices and very casual atmosphere.  Citizens Band - Good Southern-ish comfort food, great for brunch. Not exactly like back home, but this native North Carolinian approves. And there's an amazing bakery net door called Pinky's.    And speaking of Southern food, I hate to break it to you, but there's no good NC-style BBQ here. Someone did just open up a restaurant with Lexington-style BBQ that's the best so far, but it's not like home. And no one has yet figured out proper Eastern NC style. But there's still plenty of excellent Southern-inspired food around! It's strangely trendy. Be prepared to pay more for pimento cheese than you'd ever have dreamed.   If you lean non-vanilla, you're also not far from a great leather clothing & toy shop, a kink-themed cafe with decent coffee and great milkshakes, and some interesting bars and clubs. Let me know if you want details."

I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what's around this neighborhood, let alone the city, but here's a few recommendations for you:   The Hall (near 6th and Market) has a variety of small restaurants inside with open seating in the middle. They also serve wine and beer.  The Tenderloin neighborhood (just across Market) has an amazing variety of foods from many different countries. Depending on your comfort level, you might want to limit your visits to times when the sun is up.  There's a farmer's market in UN Plaza (7th and Market) every Wednesday and Sunday. Lots of fresh produce and food trucks. Speaking of food trucks, every Thursday and Friday there are food trucks in Civic Center and UN Plaza.

That being said, paying definitely has its perks, but listing your event on one of our calendars will push it out to any other website in SF using a SpinGo calendar. Instead of having to list it multiple times on multiple sites, it will automatically just be there.   Another bonus is visitors that live outside of SF. They have SpinGo calendars on their local sites, but they can change the location to SF in anticipation of their trip."

AskSF,33evn6,wellvis,3,Wed Apr 22 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"SF and Silicon Valley are different than most places, when it comes to software jobs. The people evaluating candidates here (at least beyond the first screen) are practicing software professionals, not clueless PHBs. And the work is often technically demanding; it is not feasible to undertake serious software engineering in many other locales because there are only a handful of capable people in each major city. Third, the most important thing is that you can adapt and learn. Skills and experience that wouldn't have been useful 20 years ago and 20 years from now don't count for much here, unlike in many companies elsewhere.  So, my main advice is to be humble and prep for your interviews. Nobody will give you credit for 7 years of experience; they will give you a small amount of credit for the significant technical achievements you accomplished in that time. They will rely primarily on your ability to demonstrate basic skills on the spot. Once they're convinced you are smart and capable, then they'll want to see if you're pleasant to work with and have some relevant experience.  So practice coding at the whiteboard and make sure you are sufficiently familiar with fundamental datastructures and algorithms to choose among them and implement them on the spot."
AskSF,33evn6,bq13q,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"Great advice.  I'd say my weakness is in what I call ""academia questions"".

So you're going to be writing plausible code at a whiteboard to solve problems that can be crisply defined in 5 minutes. There will be some weird wrinkle to make sure you're flexible and creative, but basically it will resemble a textbook exercise in being easy to communicate and more or less solvable in an hour.  Besides, many of us are shy, so it's stressful enough meeting new people. Meeting new people who are judging you? Even worse. Meeting people whose work you admire, who are judging you? Yikes. Practice makes that easier.  Also, IME working outside the valley, the problem mix is actually different. I spend a lot less time these days implementing the Rube Goldberg contraptions invented by MBAs, dealing with the accidental complexity of the enterprise solution framework du jour, etc. I spend more time solving problems our millions of users would actually recognize. So my daily work resembles the ""academic"" problems more closely now than it did when I was mostly shaving yaks."

AskSF,33emkt,themajesticbadger,3,Tue Apr 21 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, even the cable cars serve a reasonably large area. The main reason they're not practical is they run infrequently and are full of tourists. MUNI buses and trains serve the whole city."

If traveling to a place will take you longer than you'd like, you can use a taxi, Uber or Lyft. It will easily work out to be cheaper than renting a car. Parking in the city is so difficult that it takes away the convenience of a car.  I recommend downloading Swyft and Google Maps to use Muni. Google Maps gives you the fastest possible route, and Swyft (or nextmuni.com) has real-time arrivals. Google Maps' arrival times are inaccurate.   The cable car is definitely a tourist attraction, though a fun one. Just keep in mind that if you get on at the beginning of the tracks there will be a long line, which is the reason residents don't really use it as an actual transportation method.  The street cars are slow, but a decent way to get around."
AskSF,33emkt,themajesticbadger,0,Tue Apr 21 23:15:21 2015 UTC,"FWIW, there are a good deal of locals who use the California cable car line to commute. But yeah, the Powell lines are pretty much purely tourist attraction."

I agree with the poster who asked what you wanted to hear-- carefully consider the rationale for wanting imaging, rather than starting with non-invasive, safe, and highly efficacious treatment with strengthening muscles you don't use a lot, or correcting the root causes (e.g. bad posture, lack of breaks during a day that is-- and I'm guessing here-- spent working on a computer, holding your bowling-ball weighing head at a weird angle with your neck and upper back muscles all day against gravity, etc.), or using medications like NSAIDs or muscle relaxants as a trial.   If you really want a bunch of testing, go visit a private practice neurologist and tell them that your fingers are tingling along with this upper back pain. But caveat emptor- imaging often finds incidental abnormalities that may or may not have anything to do with your issue. It becomes very hard for people (including docs) to ignore these things, and it leads down expensive and sometimes invasive/potentially-harmful roads like spine surgery.   tl;r-- All it might take is raising the height of your monitor or breaking every 30 min or doing some deep cervical muscle strengthening exercises. PM&R is a good first step."

A bit of a hoof to Thirsty Bear from there, but maybe worth it if you are desperate.

You get an unlimited number of 'checkouts', just make sure you 'checkin' under their 30 minute time limit each time, which is more than enough for a couple miles around downtown.

AskSF,33a4o3,johnjonah,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:01:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for your feedback.  Do you have any recommendations for izakaya yourself?
AskSF,33a4o3,wellvis,2,Wed Apr 22 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"None that haven't been mentioned.  Ippuku is by far my favorite in the Bay Area (and their chicken tartare dish is my single favorite izakaya dish), but that's not in SF.  Within SF, my vote would have been Yuzuki, although they are no longer truly izakaya (still worth a visit, though).    The one place in that Yelp listing that I've been curious about is Kappou Gomi, but no one whose opinion I trust has ever been there.  Possibly I'll just walk in one day to give it a shot."
AskSF,33a4o3,johnjonah,2,Wed Apr 22 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Not that you should trust my opinion, but I've been to Kappou Gomi about 3 times.  It's not an izakaya spot at all, and we typically ordered fish dishes and soups when we were there.  It's pretty solid, but we stopped going after they had an ""off"" night where the fish tasted a little too fishy.  I think it's worth a visit, though.    And for what it's worth, I agree with you on Ippuku.  Izakaya Sozai is strong, too!"

AskSF,33aal3,sutrosam,7,Fri May 8 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Follow the Sheldon Brown locking technique by locking the rear wheel through the triangle, and preferably to a bike rack or parking meter (in a pinch). I carry around a Kryptonite Evolution Mini 5 and have successfully locked my bike up to parking meters and racks for a couple years now (vigorously knocking on wood as I type that). The key is to not leave it outside for an extended period of time. I'm usually only away from it for 30-45 minutes—if I'm planning on being gone for longer, I'll generally try to bring it with me or just leave it at home.   If extended parking is required, check out the BART Bike Station at Embarcadero Station or stations in the East Bay. Also look into BikeLink lockers around the city; these lockers are insanely cheap ($0.05/hour) and are pretty darn secure. Most festivals/events in San Francisco are required to offer staffed bike parking per city ordinance (there's a staffed bike valet at every Giants home game), make use of it and it's good karma to tip the volunteers who are running it.    As far as biking tips, just stay the hell away from Muni streetcar tracks. Also invest in a good headlight and tail light."

AskSF,33ae3n,riteturnclyde,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:12:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. So the car has to do another smog test within 90 days prior to sale? Even though it has been smoged in the past year and the two year has not been up yet.
AskSF,33ae3n,urban_,2,Tue Apr 21 13:00:29 2015 UTC,"I just sold my 2001 Honda Civic 2 weeks ago. It is the responsibility of the SELLER (me) to provide a smog test BEFORE the transaction. The person that sold you the vehicle should have done a smog test for you per California DMV.   In other words, I (the seller) had to do the smog test before accepting payment and signing the title over to the BUYER. Here is the reference from the CA DMV website:   When a car is sold, who is responsible for the inspection? The seller is required to provide the buyer with a valid smog inspection certification at the time of the sale or transfer. Smog certifications are good for 90 days from the date of issuance. The inspection is not required on a transfer if a biennial smog certification was submitted to DMV within 90 days prior to the vehicle transfer date (a vehicle inspection report may be required for proof of certification). NOTE: Smog certifications are not required for transfers that occur for a gasoline powered motor vehicle that is four or less model years old. (Determine the oldest-qualifying year model by subtracting three from the current year) the four or less model years old rule does not apply to diesel powered vehicles. A smog transfer fee will be collected from the new owner.   Link to the quote is here.  You should contact the seller and let him know. If that doesn't work, call the DMV and ask about your options.   So the car has to do another smog test within 90 days prior to sale? Even though it has been smoged in the past year and the two year has not been up yet.   And yes, even if the smog test was done 1 year before (or 5 months or 7 months), it still needs to be completed AGAIN. As long as it's 90 days or less before your transaction date, you're fine. Otherwise, you need a new one."

But yeah,  La Costena is the best salsa I know of that I can buy in this area: the fact that it's cheap is just good fortune (my local stater bros only sells La Victoria and Herdez, which I do like for some foods, just not for burritos). But I do use a lot of salsa (I eat a Chile Verde burrito for breakfast every day), so, I don't know how much I'd be willing to spend on it. I've never discovered a fresh salsa I liked the taste of. My mom's always buying the stuff, but they're always super oniony and I'm not much into that.  The best Mexican restaurant in Riverside and the entire universe is El Colima, so you should go there if you can live with the pain of not being able to go there regularly.  The second best place in Riverside is this little grocery store on Victoria that happens to also sell burritos that happen to be amazing.

Sunrise Cafe is well-known for their brunches, so when I try them I go early, but I feel like the quality has drifted a little down in the last year or so.

AskSF,32xfay,kdeowdkoedk,14,Fri Apr 17 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"Frisco's an interesting term for SF as the legitimacy of its modern use is basically on ethnic lines.  There's a lot of Black and Latino people from the Bay Area that say Frisco, but it's not really a word that whites use.  Given how common the term Frisco is generally, it's basically taken--you're not likely to ever rank highly on Google if people search for you, so I'd consider a different name."
AskSF,32xfay,combuchan,2,Fri Apr 17 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"the ethnic bit is exactly right, generally ""frisco"" is a black/latino thing but, on the ""white"" side, for a few decades after ww2, ""hip"" people (bikers, beach people, drifters, hippies, and other hardcores) adopted the word to sort of signal their hipness in contrast with the ""straight"" world.  so your charles manson says ""frisco"" but so does your uncle jerry in santa barbara with the birkenstocks.  ""frisco"" as a hip word seems to have died out definitively in the 1980s.  anyway, combuchan is right that today there's an ethnic divide on the use of the word.  to your average san franciscan ""frisco"" sounds like a word from the past."

Did you know bikes are 67% of traffic on Market?  You're not destined to get hit. I've ridden daily for 3 years with no encounters. What /u/cablecore map doesn't show is a comparison to the number of car-on-car and car-on-pedestrian accidents. Almost a million people live here, so even a ""1 in a thousand"" event would fill the map.  Used is the way to go for your price point. Only buy from Craigslist if you have a bike-savvy friend who can inspect. A good option is to buy a used bike from the many tourist-rental shops. They upgrade their fleet each year."

Relax, you'll be fine. I had no experience whatsoever when I started. The last bike I had was a mountain bike in middle school. I got a road bike and it's fantastic for commuting as it's light and fast. You should definitely start with a used bike if you're uncomfortable, and maybe a bike with a flatbar, riserbar, or cruiser bar. It'll probably be easier to steer and allow you to sit upright a little more.  If you're new and going slow, stay to the right of everybody when travelling, pass on the left, watch and learn how people navigate market street. The one thing you're gonna want to disregard is how bikers handle stop lights and crosswalks. However, do pickup how the bike lanes shift slightly left and right, which side of the car or bus to pass on market, and other helpful things that the rules of the road don't really tell you.   If you can bike in a straight line you won't hit other bikers. If you can correctly judge braking distances you will be fine. You do not have to go super fast or keep up with the other bikers, nor are you expected to.   Check this website out, it helped me a lot when I first started"

Being surrounded by other bikes makes cars a lot less scary.   Biking on Market Street during rush hour also takes a little getting used to because there are so many bikes, but just bike defensively, pass on the left, be predictable, etc. and you'll be fine.  And yes, you'll feel much safer biking through mid-market late at night than you would walking.

AskSF,32uund,BizSib,3,Fri Apr 17 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry to reply late -- yesterday was busy!  Biking with others is not as hard as it looks. Especially on market, everyone gets ""in sync"" at the stoplights. When the light turns green its easy enough to see who else is going your speed.   It works (for the most part) like in a car: slower cyclists stick to the right, faster ones pull out to pass on the left.  Once you're actually on your bike you'll see that the distances aren't so tight. On a bike a you have much more visibility, are traveling much slower, and can stop much faster than in a car. So even a few feet of distance is enough for cyclists not to run into each other. Really--I've never seen cyclists hit except in dumb circumstances like when a bozo was texting and cycling and ran into someone stopped a light.  Your question was, ""What's it like biking among so many other bikers"", and the short answer is ""Awesome!"". Market street has the most bike traffic of any street in the country. When I ride at in morning rush hour it feels like a slow ""gathering of the tribe"" as more and cyclists fill the common bike routes as I move toward Market street. Unlike in cars, its common to make smalltalk about the weather or cool helmet designs or whatever, so it feels like you're among friends. And then when I merge onto Market, it feels like I'm one in a flock of birds flowing silently down the street. It's strangely thrilling. And completely opposite to the frustration of being stuck in a car at rush hour.   Hope to see you on Market Street soon!"

AskSF,32voza,msdrahcir,4,Fri Apr 17 02:31:57 2015 UTC,If your landlord can turn around and rent your unit to somebody else quickly and for a higher rent they will probably not make it hard for you to leave. Sometimes offering to help find a replacement tenant sweetens the deal.
AskSF,32voza,AvatusKingsman,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I emailed them today asking if we could end our lease early and find a new replacement or sublet the place. Our lease says no sublets allowed without LL permission. If we do, it says they can terminate the lease. Anyways, they didnt respond about ending our lease early, all they said was in broken english and to the effect that sublets are not allowed.  Im not really sure how to proceed."
AskSF,32voza,AvatusKingsman,2,Fri Apr 17 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are almost certainly not going to want you to sublet the space - they don't get anything out of that (and you could even profit off of it, depending on the circumstances). I'm not sure what to say about the language barrier, but I would ask again specifying that you want to leave early, and will help them find a new tenant (since the main downside to them of you leaving is the hassle of finding somebody new). I'm not sure how long you have been there (I am assuming 8 months), but there is a pretty good chance that they can rent to new tenants for more than you are currently paying. They don't have to do this - you guys have a lease - but you might want to help them come to the conclusion that they are better off letting you go early. If they refuse (which they have every right to do - then you can leave early but will have to pay whatever the terms in your lease are for leaving early - this may be financially impossible for you), then you have found yourself in an unusual spot - an SF renter that their landlord wants to keep!"
AskSF,32voza,AvatusKingsman,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to have to sublet, but if they won't let us out of the lease that is frustrating. We have only been in the place for 8 months, have had gunshots on our street several times over the winter, including once through the front door and wall in our apartment building. It also took them almost two months to fix our heater after told them it was broken (which wasn't a huge deal because of SFs temperate climate, but still). Regardless, we got the place dirt cheap for the location and interior space and super cleaned up the place.  It would be easy for them to re rent. We just have a much better opportunity now. I don't want to have to deal with this.   In terms of subletting, if they really won't let us leave early without paying out the remainder of the year and our deposit, which we arent going to acquiesce to, what would happen if we did sublet without their permission? Our lease essentially lays out the remedies for subletting without their permission - that they have the right to terminate our lease. If they were to a terminate our lease because of a sublet, would we still owe them for the remainder of the lease? It doesn't say anything about this.  The only downside for the landlord I can think of is that the unit is rent controlled. It might not be possible for them to raise the rent at the moment, but I'm not sure."
AskSF,32voza,SuccorPunch,2,Fri Apr 17 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"You should probably contact these folks for some expert advice to your questions. I'm pretty sure that the rent control part is a non-issue for the landlords - if you leave and they start a new lease with a new tenant they can charge that new tenant whatever they want - rent control only applies to an existing tenancy. I'm almost wondering if there is just a misunderstanding going on between you and your landlord, perhaps due to the language issue. They may have seen the word ""sublet"" and freaked out (that is not something that landlords in rent controlled apartments generally want to let happen) and didn't understand the actual situation - that you want to leave and that it will probably mean that they will make more money. They have every legal right to say no to that, but many landlords would take the promise of more money through higher rent over forcing a tenant to honor the remainder of their lease. I have personally been in your situation more than once, and the landlords were happy to have me help them rent out their place for them (by showing the place, interviewing prospects, etc) for a higher price than I was paying, and that was several years ago before prices started rising as rapidly as they have been lately. Good luck."

AskSF,32ufdx,kebabmybob,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"I have some friends moving up from LA and told them to ask for a 15-25k raise, that's about how much I'm estimating their housing is going to cost extra.  However, depending on the part of Santa Monica (e.g., anywhere walking distance to the beach), the cost of living is actually much closer to SF compared to most of LA.  Nicer 1BRs in SM can easily go for $3k+ like SF (though I'm sure cheaper options are a bit easier).  Since you mentioned ""brand new apartment building"" I'm going to guess it's actually somewhat comparable in price to SF, the difference might be a few hundred a month instead of a thousand.  Definitely ask for a raise, but the CoL difference between SM and SF isn't quite as large as South LA and SF."

It depends where you live in the city, however; some neighborhoods are much easier than others without a car."
AskSF,32ufdx,jcook793,3,Thu Apr 16 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on your lifestyle and the neighborhood you end up in (can you walk or take public transit to work?), but if your new place doesn't come with parking, I would get rid of it.  Having to circle around looking for parking, moving it around for street cleaning, etc. can be a huge hassle that might not be worth it if you end up only needing it once or twice a month.  You can always join Zipcar or something similar if you find yourself needing a car a couple times a month.  If you end up saving a few hundred bucks a month, that really narrows the CoL difference too.  Now if your lifestyle is such that you end up doing a lot of weekend trips (Napa, Tahoe, etc.), Costco runs a lot, etc. then I would keep the car."

They have three stories of seating as well as conference rooms you can rent out (I believe they are free or very cheap).  Workshop Cafe is another one of my favorites. It's actual a workspace with about 100+ seats. The workspace is seperate from the cafe so everyone in the workspace is actually working rather than socializing, etc. The first 10 hours are free, $2 per hour after that.  Starbucks is an obvious option, however, the Starbucks inside the presidio is typically pretty slow so you can grab a table and work for a while.

Any reason why you're not taking one of the more commercial streets (Irving, Clement, etc.), or going through the park itself?

AskSF,32oh1w,Zharol,4,Wed Apr 15 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"As someone who loves urban walks, and has walked most streets in the city -- good for you! If you keep your eyes open and just stop when you see anything interesting, you'll have a really good time.  A couple of offbeat initial thoughts that come to mind are:   The Playland at the Beach markers at the former Playland MUNI stop. It's right near Ocean Beach on the north side of the Safeway parking lot at La Playa and Cabrillo, a block north of Fulton. (Playland itself was a major attraction back in the day, an amusement park on the ocean.) The Columbarium, a couple of blocks north of Fulton at the eastern end of Golden Gate Park.   There are other more obvious spots such as City Hall, and you'll stumble across all sorts of other things. Myself, I'd probably walk through Golden Gate Park (a top tier urban park that anyone who appreciates parks shouldn't miss) or on Cabrillo, since Fulton has pretty heavy car traffic making it a less pleasant walk."

I grew up by Ocean Beach and I think a prettier route would be to start at Ocean Beach the head up to Land's end/Sutro bath then take the trail all the way through Sea Cliff (neighborhood with multi-million mansions), which leads you to the Presidio (former army base) and Marina and finally arriving at Fisherman's Wharf. Instead of heading to Fisherman's Wharf after the Presidio, another option is go to Golden Gate Bridge or the Palace of Fine Arts.  Here is a map of the route."

AskSF,32pfbc,lifeonmar5,3,Wed Apr 15 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"You can rent bikes at Fishermans Wharf, which you should otherwise avoid, and ride over the Golden Gate bridge to Sausalito. Sushi Ran in Sausalito is one of the best in the Bay Area. Or try taking the ferry to Tiburon and back and go to one of the restaurants near the ferry stop -- its a gorgeous trip and cheap. Get a map of Golden Gate park and walk the whole thing. You won't believe half of the stuff that's in there .. you can also walk from there to Clement street that has a ton of great cheap international cuisine restaurants. Use yelp or yplan apps to find deals and reviews wherever you are."
AskSF,32pfbc,themajesticbadger,0,Thu Apr 16 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Got it. Some recs (favorites are bolded):  Nice meal (try not to show up without a reservation):   You could do the Sunday night fixed menu at Cotogna ($55 sans wine pairings), or Foreign Cinema. Both feel very special and are very delicious, with lots to do nearby.  Dive bars:   Zeitgeist (AMAZING beer selection and beer garden)/Doc's Clock (shuffle board!)/Rosamunde (pubby atmosphere and good beer)/Blind Cat (classic dive) are all within walking distance of Foreign Cinema.   Vesuvio (super classic San Francisco)/Kennedy's (cheap Irish bar with good beer attached to an Indian restaurant)/Bamboo Hut (weird dive tiki bar)/Rogue/Columbus Cafe (2 for 1 drinks in a super divey atmosphere/Mario's Cigar Bar (classic Italian spot) are all walkable from Cotogna.   I also recommend Toronado (best moderately priced beer bar in the city) and the nearby Mad Dog in the Fog (classic pub). People like the feel of Southern Pacific Brewing, though their beer isn't so good (best to get the guest beers). It's also near to Homestead.  If you want to class it up a little for cool cocktail bars, check out Trick Dog (near Southern Pacific and Foreign Cinema), Bourbon and Branch (need a reservation, and be careful in that neighborhood), Comstock Saloon (near Cotogna) or 15 Romolo (near Cotogna).  Shopping district is centered around Union Square. There are also interesting boutiques in Hayes Valley, along Valencia Street and in the Marina and North Beach.  I recommend hiking up to the top of Bernal Heights for a good view of the city, and spending a day in Golden Gate Park. You should also hike around Sutro Baths. I'm not a huge biking expert, but know you can bike over the Golden Gate Bridge and spend a day riding around Marin Headlands for some gorgeous views. Then take the ferry back from Sausalito. Look up Blazing Saddles -- I know they have a rental spot in North Beach.   The best chill and drink experience: grab a six pack or two and sit in Dolores Park, Conservatory of Flowers or Alamo Square. Lovely!"

Also, the pics are deceiving- 550 sq ft. is tiny, the bed in the last pic is probably a child's bed, the furniture miniature. The fact the the walls are not parallel makes much of the space useless- The building is a cool 60's Moderne style, but IIRC, it is kinda rundown inside and the elevators are about as big as a phone booth.  And... the neighborhood is really not that great. Semi-ghetto on one side, old folks on another,  mad construction on another side for at least the next 3-4 years.

AskSF,32lgv8,hotpa2d,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"I've dealt with this person. It is definitely a scam. After we responded to an ad in Craigslist, he took down the ad - so the links in craigslist no longer worked. The photos of the property were gone. He uses generic photos on a ""lease"", but does no due diligence about who he is renting to. He never provides a real address. His name is probably not his real first and last name. It's unclear where he is physically he lists multiple addresses on the site, but when you use google streetview for the address, and there's no unit or apartment number - so it is not the real thing. He (they?) communicates exclusively via text and email, from multiple numbers. Calls to his number go straight to voice mail. There is a ridiculous clause on his lease that states that if the property isn't to your liking you will get $500 back and a letter of apology. I think that takes this scam over the edge. Once you agree to rent the property - he provided a lease with another name and address. The phone number for the ""property owner"" that he provided was disconnected. If you begin to ask questions, he will protest and act offended that you are trying to ascertain his legitimacy. He'll use generic statements such as ""our reputation..."" and ""It sounds like you are questioning that we are a real business / actually exist"" - which is something that no legitimate sales person would say. He did nothing to prove he is real, would not respond to requests for his personal information and actual verifiable residence. I believe that multiple people are involved in this scam. They can do this as a team all day and all night. Since I called and he only responded with more texts, I can say that a real sales person - even a scammer - would call back. Long story short, stay the heck away from ""Raymond Collins"" or ""Collins Raymond"" and collinshomerentals.com  This is just a front for a scam operation, that may involve more than one person.

AskSF,32ftml,paintingofamonkey,9,Mon Apr 13 13:27:27 2015 UTC,"What is a normal tip (percentage) and who do you tip (only restaurants or also for other things)?  In San Francisco, you should almost always tip 20% for restaurant or cab service, unless the service is poor or you're using a service like Uber where the tip is already part of the price. If you use a valet, a couple of bucks unless it's slow. In some areas of the country with a lower cost of living, tips are around 15%, but you should probably keep it to 20% in California.  What sort of prices do you pay for a (cheap) hotel / motel?  In San Francisco a nice but inexpensive room will run $180 - $250. In smaller cities or more rural areas, the same room would be $70 - $120.   Do you recommend to book hotels online or just on the road?  Definitely book in advance if you're looking to stay in San Francisco - or really any large city. Some events, conferences and festivals will cause a substantial number of hotels to sell out, and you really don't want to have to go door to door and settle for somewhere awful.  On the other hand, if you're driving on the highway and just need to pull over to sleep, chances are you'll be able to find a room in a small town without a booking.  Do you recommend to book a renatal car online or on arrival?  Many people just get a car on arrival. It's far less risky than not booking a hotel, as while some car rental firms may sell out, it's generally unlikely they'll all sell out, and they're all at the airport so you don't have to wander around the city.   However, you will almost definitely get a better rate if you book in advance, and if you're doing something fancy like a one way rental, this can be a substantial difference. Book in advance if you can.  If you visit a natural park, would you just do it yourself or take a guided tour? (and are the parks free or is there a fee)?  The fees for park access depend on the park (and the mode of transportation and/or season) and can vary pretty widely, so check online with the parks you're looking to go to. All of the parks have walking tours that you can totally do on your own, but for something like the Grand Canyon, there are special tours like helicopter tours that many find enjoyable.  How many days would you recommend spending in SF for a 2 week holiday?  There's tons of things to do in SF and in day trips from SF, so this can vary pretty widely. Some people spend a rushed weekend, other people could spend two weeks. However:  So far our plan is to rent a car and drive to yosemite, death valley, las vegas and grand canyon  So, yeah, that's a lot of driving for a two week trip, probably four days spent primarily on the road. Don't get me wrong, it's totally doable if you're the kind of person who likes epic road trips, but for me, that's a lot of time on the road.  If I were you, I would fly into Las Vegas, see the Grand Canyon, spend another night or two in Las Vegas, and then make your way to California through Death Valley and Yosemite, spending your last several days in SF, and then flying out from here. It's still a lot of driving - but I think round trip between SF and the Grand Canyon would just be too much.  There are endless things to see and do in Las Vegas and San Francisco, so I'll leave the specifics to travel guides and other people."

It's still a lot of driving - but I think round trip between SF and the Grand Canyon would just be too much.   This is solid advice right here. If you do the desert and GC drives at the end of your trip it might feel like something you have to rush through to get to Vegas on schedule. But at the beginning it's new and fun and you can take detours without worrying about the schedule.  You'll also save money on the rental car, since once you're in SF you can return it and just use public transportation."

At first we wanted to drive to Dallas and back, but reading this I now think we would spend most of our holiday in the car."
AskSF,32ftml,ImFeklhr,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, driving from SF to Dallas and back on a two week trip would have been pretty brutal, and probably not fun at all. This is a big country, with lots of wide open spaces where there's nothing going on except some strip malls and places to rest your head. It'd be like flying into Amsterdam and driving to Bulgaria or Istanbul and back, except more boring. (Also, as most San Franciscans will tell you, if you're going to Texas, you want to go to Austin, not Dallas. ;)  The people who say that taking Highway 1 up or down the California coast is technically a more fun drive than going from Yosemite to Las Vegas are probably right, and Highway 1 is beautiful, but if you were planning on going to Dallas, it sounds like you might be looking for more of the unique American Southwest feel that the SF/Yosemite/Las Vegas/Grand Canyon trip would provide. If that's the case, the suggestion to take an additional side trip to Zion is a good one, and as a different side trip from SF you could catch some of the best of Highway 1 by taking it from SF through Pacifica and Half Moon Bay, which is a remarkably beautiful drive that only takes around two hours round-trip and transitions from the fog of Pacifica to the surf of Mavericks. If you've got a whole day, you could go all the way down to the Santa Cruz beach and boardwalk.  Have a good time!"

Sant cruz we could stop, we will pass it anyway. :-)"
AskSF,32ftml,ImFeklhr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:40:03 2015 UTC,"Not to distract from the great answers you gave, but I don't really understand why tipping should scale up in % because of cost of living.  Shouldn't the higher cost of goods/services naturally increase the amount the tip is even if you don't change the percentage? If things in a lower cost of living area are $10 and in California they are $15. Then a 15% tip will be $1.50 and $2.25 respectively. It's not like waiters in California work harder than elsewhere.  If they did, then I definitely go up to 20%.  This creep of normal tip going from 15% to 20% just doesn't make any sense to me, and I see it all over."
AskSF,32ftml,paintingofamonkey,3,Wed Apr 15 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"That's assuming that all costs rise proportionally to each other.  California has extremely high housing costs as well as high income taxes compared with other states, but the cost of food is actually lower than in many areas of the country. While restaurants may be more expensive here, the added cost of a restaurant meal is not as proportionally high as the added cost of housing and many other services.  San Francisco and California do have higher minimum wages to make up for some of this, but those minimum wages are still very low. This year, a server working 40 hours a week would only make $22k without tips. Good luck living in the Bay Area on that.  I dislike tipping - I would rather that restaurant staff just make a living wage without additional intervention from customers. But they don't, and housing costs are sky high while that restaurant meal isn't (at least at the not-so-fancy restaurants I go to), so 20% it is."
AskSF,32ftml,WhoTookPlasticJesus,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"Do you get to keep the minimum wage and tips? If so, and assuming you work 40 hours a week, you would need to clear about $115 in tips per shift to get to $50k per year.  Which means you need to have about $500 in customer bills, at 20% tipping to get there.  Maybe at some small mom and pop restaurant that is tricky.  But that's like 10 2-person tables per shift at most medium prices eateries.   And yes I know $50k isn't enough to live in San Francisco, but that's not unique to waitstaff, a lot of professions can't manage to live here."
AskSF,32ftml,infix,2,Wed Apr 15 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"In California you get to keep the minimum wage and tips. And yes, your math is correct. Except:   You can't assume everyone tips 20% Tips are often shared with bus and kitchen staff The majority of restaurants in SF are small mom and pop restaurants. There are loads of good $9-$15/entree independent sit-down restaurants here, and even trendier places like State Bird Provisions or Mission Chinese still manage to be in that price range. We're not all eating at Gary Danko every night."
AskSF,32ftml,AliceInBondageLand,3,Wed Apr 15 21:39:15 2015 UTC,"You should look into Airbnb-type services for places to stay in SF. You will likely save money over hotels, and it's more fun to live like a local. It's also quite likely that someone from SF wants to spend some time in the Netherlands and the same time you're stateside, so you might find an apartment swap.  I don't mean to dissuade you from the desert and Yosemite-- they're beautiful-- but as fans of nature I'd suggest that you at least look into Central and Northern coasts as well. Highway 1 is an amazing drive (assuming you don't get car sick) dotted by a bunch of little beach towns. Big Sur is a pretty special place and can be reasonably priced if you plan ahead. Monterey and Carmel are worth a day, though perhaps not a night. Santa Cruz is a lot of fun with great beaches plus, you know, vampires.  You should check out Muir Woods while you're in SF. It's only about 45 minutes away, plus you get to drive across the Golden Gate bridge to get there. Take the Stinson Beach route for the drive home (if you've ever seen the movie Basic Instinct that's where Sharon Stone's character's house is).  Get a bottle of wine, a loaf of bread, some salami, and some cheese at the Ferry Building, then go for an afternoon/sunset hike in the Marin Headlands.  Unless you're very into wine, I suggest skipping Sonoma/Napa. Don't get me wrong, I love it up there, but if you have a limited amount of time I think there are prettier, more interesting places to spend those hours."
AskSF,32ftml,paintingofamonkey,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the great suggestions, I'm not a big wine guy so I don't mind skipping Sonoma/Napa.  The AirBnB is a very good suggestion I just looked and most of these places look much better thant the very cheap hotels.  Highway 1 looks really great, it's going be difficult to make a choice."
AskSF,32ftml,WhoTookPlasticJesus,2,Tue Apr 14 06:27:08 2015 UTC,"I think you'll spend most of your time driving with that itinerary. I would suggest skipping Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, too far away. Yosemite is a 4 hour drive from SF and Death Valley is about 10 hours. You may need to reserve camp sites ahead of time if you plan to camp. Recreation.gov."
AskSF,32ftml,WorkingISwear,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"What is a normal tip (percentage) and who do you tip (only restaurants or also for other things)? - I tip everyone that provides me with a service, in general. Restaurants get 20% from me if they are good.  My favorite ""affordable"" hotel in San Francisco is $220 per night. It is the Carriage Inn (now run by Best Western).  Do you recommend to book hotels online or just on the road? - I never assume there will be room, I book ahead of time through AirBnB or with a hotel I like.  How many days would you recommend spending in SF for a 2 week holiday? At least 5 days. There is a lot to see.  Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon are a VERY LONG DRIVE away. We're talking between 10 and 16 hours one way depending on traffic and how fast you drive."
AskSF,32ftml,WhoTookPlasticJesus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:56:29 2015 UTC,"We do plan to drive and find hotels on the road (or book them ahead). So we can spend some days in SF and drive to the next place for 1 or 2 days, and keep going.  I was thinking about ending the trip in Las Vegas so we can get a flight back to SF. For some reason 2 different plane tickets (from the Netherlands to SF and from Las Vegas back to the Netherlands), is about twice as expensive as a retour flight from NL to SF and back. So if we find a cheap flight from Vegas back to SF it would save us about a 1000 dollars."
AskSF,32ftml,calystra,2,Mon Apr 13 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"If you're checking prices online, don't book the itinerary as two one-way flights, which will indeed be very high. Book it as a single itinerary ""multi-city"" or ""multiple destinations"" ticket, and it should be much cheaper.  However, if you do need to hop between cities, Virgin America offers frequent and inexpensive one-way flights between SF and Las Vegas, and their in-flight service is excellent."
AskSF,32ftml,carneasada_fries,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"Echoing the VA recommendation, but McCarren (the Vegas airport) is laid out really weirdly and you might have to go through customs and immigration, then turn back around and go through security all over again between flights. Just talk to the Virgin American people about your plans before you book."

AskSF,32ftml,blukatgrl,1 point,Mon Apr 13 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of road trips in the US.  I'd get the rental car in advance - you'll get better rates.  If you know you're going to be in a certain area for a certain number of days, book the hotel in advance ... especially for big cities like SF.  The rest you can just book same day or a day or two in advance if you're driving - get an app on your phone and a data plan for hotels.com or something.  The trip you're outlining, even with the flight back from Vegas is a lot of driving.  And a lot of it is super boring.  An alternative might be to do Yosemite, Sequoia, Death Valley and Joshua Tree.  Then if time permits, you could swing to San Diego / LA and back to SF up route 1 on the coastline.  There are beaches there you can see elephant seals and other wildlife as well.  Entry fees vary but usually around $10 to $20 USD and most things are self-guided unless you choose to sign up for additional tours.  I haven't done many tours but try to go to some of the free programs they have running in the parks.  That's completely up to you and how much money you want to spend.    I think people have answered the other questions well. :)"

I used to take public transportation to Skyline College by taking Bart then taking SamTrans.  (It was around $5 to school and $5 back home)  But, I then found a garage at a reasonable price to park my motorcycle and now just ride my motorcycle to school.  The only reason I didn't go to San Francisco City College is because I heard they had problems with accreditation and I didn't want to take classes and have them not count, so I went to Skyline instead."

You can drive up to Christmas Tree Point and there are stone benches where you can just sit for a while if you like just hanging out for a while.  There's also the drive-by tourism that involves driving to the batteries in Marin and taking a couple of photographs of the city. Fantastic views."
