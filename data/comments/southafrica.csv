southafrica,3e1ghm,cpdutoit_reddit,4,Tue Jul 21 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"E-filing can literally take you 10 minutes.  That is if your company submitted your IRP5 already and your medical aid and retirement fund have e-mailed you the necessary tax certificates.  As long as you have all this information, you can also fill it in yourself.  Just make sure you get the relevant tax certificates from all the places, including your employer.  You never even interact with any SARS person.  When you register and log in onto e-filing, you select which pages you need and the form generates itself.  Then you just fill in all the necessary information and click submit.  You do not print anything.  Everything is digital, therefore you do not sign it either as your site registration acts as your identification, since your tax number is connected to it.  They send you a confirmation e-mail and usually you get your money back within 2 days.  If you don't you should contact them to hear if anything is wrong on your form. The amount stated should have a minus in front, which means you owe less than zero rand, which means they have to pay you back.  The best part is that SARS is one of the only government agencies which works near perfectly, so it is extremely easy.  I like doing it myself, since paying someone R300 on a R3000 tax return for something that can take 10 minutes feels like blood money.  However, if you have a lot of till slips or travel allowance slips which you want to claim, a tax practitioner would be a better option, since that takes time and can be done wrong by yourself.  I throw all my till slips away, so I do not claim them, and my company includes the travel tax in my normal salary tax, since I travel only about 3 times a year.  I hope this helps.  If you need any more specific help, feel free to ask."

southafrica,3e1ghm,Ruach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:30:18 2015 UTC,"If you only one source of income then efiling is a piece of cake.  Even if you have more than one source, if you have IRP5s for all of them and none of them entitle to claim out of the ordinary expenses, (like travelling , entertainment or office at home), then go for it.  What you will need:   Income - IRP5 for each source of income. Deductions - documentary proof for these. The standard    deductions are for retirement annuities, medical aid/expenses  charitable donations (only oif you have a certificate from the   charity).  Note that when you fill in the forms online you will only be   asked to list the above and not to upload any proof. Proof  will   be requested when the filing is audited.  Also SARS will probably already have your IRP5s online - the   employers normally submits it as well.  At worst case if you make a hash of it, take a day off and go to   your nearest SARS office. An assessor will help you."

Many leaders in the revolutionary era had an ambivalent relationship with their communist sponsors, and the west; Ho Ch Minh, for example first sought US aid in the struggle against the French, before turning to the Soviet Union.   Even leaders such as Iran's Mohammad Mosaddegh, who were not specifically communist but favoured social reform, were likely to be seen as a threat to western interests.

Many states have lived with institutionalized racism for decades until the 1960s, and even after that I'm not so sure it has left us as we witness so many of the racial incidents that come up around the nation and expose people's ideologies for what they really are. The debate on how prevalent racism is in American society has started to gain ground again recently, and Madiba's book has got me thinking hard about it. If a significant portion of our so-called developed population has such uninformed views, what does that say about the ability of the US to move forward in its own history? Not a whole lot of good, I'm afraid.  Haha that's crazy. I didn't know we had that kind of reputation there! :P I would love to visit myself. As an Indian American, I would blend right in!

We were a valuable anti-communist ally in Africa, which was rapidly turning to Marxism. So it made sense for them to turn a blind eye to our goings on as long as we were standing up to communists in places like Angola and Mozambique.  Once it was sort of clear that the Berlin Wall was going to fall, our usefulness sort of ran its course, and the US was forced to reevaluate our relationship.   Of course, I'm not sure if any of that is true, really. But it definitely makes sense in the context of US foreign policy of turning a blind eye to have valuable friends."

In Mandelas case, as it is with most Non-American American hero's, its not so much about being ""saintlike"" as it is living a life that comes close to some manifestation of the American Dream.  Statesman who came from nothing, fought an oppressive regime through overwhelming strife and tragedy before becoming a sagelike political prisoner with a third act that has him forgiving his enemy's, preventing a civil war and becoming the first black president? C'mon. The problems started when the American media, academics and politicians decided to canonize him and either excuse, justify or completely ignore anything that didn't fot their platonic ideal of what a Mandela was. For proof, one just has to look at how Winnie is still viewed by Americans.  So almost without exception, Americans love and respect Mandela, but over time the left have claimed them as their own and turned him into a secular, black christ figure and one who's image their politicians repeatedly use to make politic hay. Naturally, the reactionaries, who have no interest past tearing down anything their opponents revere, make a much bigger deal of the less savory parts of his life. Sometimes the attacks are exaggerated and simplified, but often they're doing little more than pointing out that Mandela wasn't as infallible as he's usually portrayed, and for some that's a sacrilege that can't be tolerated or left unchallenged.   tldr: In America, Mandela is widely respected but the more extreme elements of the conservative and liberal media and politics use caricatures of him as a political tool."

Too many people here think they have a better idea of how the world should be run than everyone else.  So in Mandela's book, he outlines sabotage and terrorism as two separate possible approaches for Umkhonto out of four (one was guerrilla warfare, I forget the other). He did not want to take lives and lose support for his movement, so he said sabotage was their desired course of action. From what I've heard elsewhere, though, Umkhonto took up arms against civilians while he was in prison and not able to lead the movement with Tambo and Sisulu."

southafrica,3dx4n6,sooibot,4,Tue Jul 21 04:04:07 2015 UTC,"Saying Mandela was a terrorist is no different from calling George Washington one.  But firstly, let's dismiss the notion that criticism of Mandela should be seen as condoning apartheid or what it stood for. I'll bet that even he would've agreed that no-one should be above reproach.   For someone who vehemently denies that he did not believe in the principles of communism, his actions did though sometimes imply otherwise:  1) He was the deputy president of a political party which adopted a freedom charter, that contains phrases like ""and all the land re-divided amongst those who work it."" and ""the Banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole"".  2) He was president of a political party that went into an alliance, and still was after his death, with the South African Communist Party (SACP). The SACP clearly states, in its constitution, that ""the SACP is guided by those principles of Marxism-Leninism whose universal validity has been proven by historical experience.""  More broadly though, my biggest criticism by far of Mandela would be his totally inexplicable tolerance of what transpired north of his borders in the vulgar rape of democracy by Robert Mugabe, and the immeasurable suffering that it brought Zimbabweans. Secondly, how he allowed AIDS denialist Thabo Mbeki, the son of his close friend Govan, to succeed him."

Secondly, how he allowed AIDS denialist Thabo Mbeki, the son of his close friend Govan, to succeed him.   I don't think you wanted Mandela to pull a Mbeki.

No-one said he should've waded in there with troops.    Mugabe has a huge pull within the SADEC region.   Part of the reason for that is that other people with huge pull in SADEC, like Mandela, decided to keep their mouths shut, and in doing so endorsed him and his bent elections.   Mandela actually wanted Cyril to be the next president.   From none other but anc.org.za itself:   ""Mbeki was hand-picked by Nelson Mandela after the April 1994 general election to be the first Deputy President of the new Government of National Unity"""
southafrica,3dx4n6,sooibot,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:33 2015 UTC,"We have to be careful in equating silence to taciturn endorsement. I'm not saying it was right in that case, as to my knowledge Mugabe is an absolute piece of shit, but we don't know the reasons he kept silent.  Also, if my understanding is correct, isn't deputy president similar to our office of vice president? I don't think that meant he wanted the election after his term to go to Mbeki, but he can't force democracy to produce a certain outcome, as bad as AIDS-denial is, or he would be violating the very principles he stood for."
southafrica,3dx4n6,RuanStix,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"The picking of the next president had basically occurred by CODESA (1993). Cyril decided to go out after how Mbeki had put him out in the cold.  Cyril Ramaphosa: the return of Nelson Mandela's chosen one  This is something any ANC stalwart will tell you. Mandela moreover did not want another Xhosa person ascending the presidency as it might lead to tribalist factionalism.   Part of the reason for that is that other people with huge pull in SADEC, like Mandela, decided to keep their mouths shut, and in doing so endorsed him and his bent elections.   Nope. Even your ""altruistic"" western countries waded in only when their interests were at stake and they could look good without having any real effect. Look at where their multinationals are now, they are all trying to comply with whatever laws Zim has thrown at them. Watch when the economy picks up and Sanctions just disappear."
southafrica,3dx4n6,sooibot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"1) Again, I am not a South African history expert, but I think it's a little misleading to take those phrases out of context. A big feature of Apartheid was unfair apportionment of land, like what happened in Sophiatown and with the Indians during Smuts's rule (that is, until Yusuf Dadoo and Monty Naicker led their opposition to that law). It's not necessarily an inherently communist thing to say that the land should be redistributed after years of unfair redistribution by the state itself.  2) Like I said below, Mandela was wary of making an alliance with the SACP and SAIC for similar reasons. According to his book, he and many other main figures of the ANC believed that allying with the communists meant they had to embrace a white-dominated ideology, which made them uncomfortable, and if they couldn't join non-blacks in the struggle, then the Indians were out of the question as well. This opinion of his changed once he noted the efficacy of Dadoo and Naicker's campaign. If they had to join forces with the Indians, they had to pull in other main bodies similarly committed to the anti-apartheid movement.  And with regards to Mugabe and Mbeki, see my response below."

As for personal notifications, this was published in April this year with regards to this system:    The meters will be “load- limited” every time Eskom asks municipalities to load-shed. City Power will be able to do this remotely. Residents will receive an SMS on their cellphones and smart meter devices advising them to reduce their power usage.   (http://www.iol.co.za/business/news/obey-your-smart-meter-1.1847128)  Loadshedding requires that the consumption of electricity be reduced by a certain amount. The only way I see this happening is by only allowing you to only use a certain amount of kW per hour.

southafrica,3dwwwa,D-Hex,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:38:18 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with nationalised companies, it's the way that they are run that matters. This idea that the private sector is always better is bunk. Organisations can be well run or not, this applies to big companies like Boeing to large national orgs like the UK's NHS or ""parastatals"" like French EDF  Edit:Dear downvoters.

southafrica,3dwwwa,NoNameMonkey,4,Mon Jul 20 08:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think that when they nationalise banks and they end up being run as well as the post office we will all think how great this was for our country.  Sarcasm aside, the whole nationalism thing really goes to the idea that government will do better when it has more money and power.  I am of the opinion that government has proven that more money isn't the answer.  (example is education where we spend far more than other countries and get worse results)  Sadly I don't think the EFF will be better than the ANC at keeping their hands out of the public purse.  I also don't think they will do a better job of governing.  Their violent reactions when they don't get what they want concerns me - if this is what they are like without power, how can we assume they will be better with it?  Lastly, this is a party that maintains Zimbabwe has been highly successful in its economy.  They are following an idealogy that has been proven to fail, and fail again.  Why will what didn't work anywhere else, work here?"
southafrica,3dwwwa,D-Hex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"EFF say that stuff to wind people up. Malema knows his constituency and how to press the right buttons. He drives the middle class mad but that's because he couldn't give two hoots about the middle class.  The violent reaction is because they don't have other options. Seriously, ask yourself how you'd get by in a shack in Tembisa? When all around you hear tales of people doing X,Y and Z to make money. You know people thought that after the end of Apartheid they'd have houses and work. They didn't get it. Imagine that after decades of struggle that you're still stuck in the same place but now apparently you are ""free"".  What you can blame the ANC for is that they underestimated how fucked society was through Apartheid and how they could fix it. By signing up to the economic programme that was delivered by MBeki under the shadow of Mandela they just ended up entrenching the powers of people like Anglo.  Which did nothing for the population but made a few people very very rich."
southafrica,3dwwwa,NoNameMonkey,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:39 2015 UTC,"So a political party can make wild and reckless statements and not be judged on it? Language is a powerful tool and I don't see why we should not try to improve the quality of our political dialogue.  Remember that calling people cockroaches has shown to help get people get killed.  Politicians have a duty to be careful with their words. I don't give anyone a free ride on that.  The violent reaction I was talking about was the EFF, not communities.  Remember when we saw them of TV breaking down the doors and forcing their way into a government building?  That's what I am talking about.  They have stated and acted in ways that show they don't care about the rule of law unless it serves their purpose.  What economic program do you suggest we follow?  Capatilism has been proven to create more wealth and lift more people up than any other system. The ANC changed course on what they wanted to do largely based on the advise of the Chinese who had come to that same conclusion.  There are many reasons why it hasn't delivered here, much of it based on our history and much of it caused by things the ANC government did and continue to do.  So what is your alternative?  Sadly I don't know because we seem unable to create and environment that creates jobs.  We cant educate people to a point where they can be employed.  We refuse to follow the recipe for success that other countries have."
southafrica,3dwwwa,D-Hex,0,Mon Jul 20 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"So a political party can make wild and reckless statements and not be judged on it?   It's not wild, Malema knows exactly what he's doing.   Because he knows this:    Language is a powerful tool    He's got the entirety of SA chuckling at ""Where is the money"" and gets replays on Youtube all the time.  He knows that more than anyone. Why does the EFF where the hats and the uniforms. They're doing political theatre because they know their constituency responds    They have stated and acted in ways that show they don't care about the rule of law unless it serves their purpose.   Which isn't a) different from anyone else trying to form a gov and b) their constituency doesn't trust or believe in those laws because they see them as a compromise too far that left them behind.    Capatilism has been proven to create more wealth and lift more people up than any other system.    And also create scales of ineqaulity and resource imbalance beyond anything ever known in history. We've know the darkside of capitalism for a long time. Heck , even the big corps know this and are trying hard to adapt some of their behaviours because of this.   This doesn't invalidate the point of those that are suffering that they are suffering.    So what is your alternative?   Hold on to your helmets and hope that the good people do sort it out, because there's more than enough civic activity and intellectual activity that will come good - but only towards the tail end of exercising apartheid's ghosts."
southafrica,3dwwwa,NoNameMonkey,3,Mon Jul 20 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"I don't dispute that Malema knows what he is doing - I am arguing that it is irresponsible and dangerous. And I am not arguing that he doesn't know that and is doing it on purpose.  I am saying that we need a different level of dialogue to help SA navigate the changes to come.  Not respecting the law by outright and violently showing contempt just creates problems for us down the line.  When the EFF comes to power, will they change laws or will they just completely ignore what they don't like?  The message that the laws are imposed on people by a legacy of apartheid may be true, but by denying the validity of law instead of working to change it removes the stability and safety the law brings to citizens.  We have seen that happen across Africa and NO ONE has been better off because of it.  Your criticism of capitalism is valid, but you - and the EFF - offer no workable alternative.  The current thinking (at least from the economic books I have been studying for my BA) is that you need a mixed economy - where you have an economy that makes jobs and gives gov money to work on social issues.  You also seem to ignore that to be poor in a strong economy is often better than being poor in a weak economy.  There is more money for charity, there is more money for social programs.  I don't claim to have the answers but I think there is evidence that the policies being championed by the EFF - which are fantastic sounding to the poor - will not fix anything.   For me this all comes down to some major failings in what we did since we became free:   The ANC did not push to reclaim land in the negotiations or to fundamentally change the economy during the negotiations.  They did not ask for it, largely because they had begun to reconsider the idea of it being good for the country.  This is covered by a lot of the people from the ANC's side who were in the negotiations.    The failure we have is that they never sold this idea to the voters and even within the ANC.  The political cost was too high.  The freedom charter had too much value as a political tool and to be honest, its ideals still resonated with the members. We see now how several leaders down the line the change if ideas never took internally.    We chose a constitutional democracy.  The ANC chose this.  But they again did not educate the populous or their own members on what it means which is why we hear Zuma make statements that are contradictory to the ideals of democracy and the constitution.   We talk today about making History a subject people have to take until grade 12. But we have no course at school where we are teaching kids about the future - we don't teach principles of democracy, we don't teach how the law words and why it works that way.  We don't teach civics in any way to the future voters.  We have not sold that this is the type of government we need to voters."
southafrica,3dwwwa,D-Hex,0,Tue Jul 21 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"Your criticism of capitalism is valid, but you - and the EFF - offer no workable alternative.   Please don't conflate my criticism of your fallacies with support for Malema.   I'm not supporting Malema, I'm pointing out that the private/public sector division meaningless because big organisations no matter which sector always have massive issues with efficiency.   The current thinking (at least from the economic books I have been studying for my BA) is that you need a mixed economy - where you have an economy that makes jobs and gives gov money to work on social issues. You also seem to ignore that to be poor in a strong economy is often better than being poor in a weak economy.   Actually you may want to put your BA textbooks away, because that has been argued over for decades. The emerging evidence is that a re-distributive economy is better for the poor than a classically liberal one. Strength has little to do with it, aside from raising revenues at a better rate - it's how these revenues get to the places they are supposed to.  The problem with South Africa on that front is that it doesn't have effective infrastructure to redistribute the wealth, and is actively failing to build on what it does have.    The ANC did not push to reclaim land in the negotiations or to fundamentally change the economy during the negotiations. They did not ask for it, largely because they had begun to reconsider the idea of it being good for the country. This is covered by a lot of the people from the ANC's side who were in the negotiations.    And the major corporations during the Dakkar conference threatened capital flight if that did happen. The ANC made the choice because it didn't want Anglo and Rio Tinto pulling out their capital from the country , which it knew it needed.    The freedom charter had too much value as a political tool and to be honest, its ideals still resonated with the members. We see now how several leaders down the line the change if ideas never took internally.   Actually the idea did take internally, that's why they are in a mess. People died for the achievements of the ANC and the Freedom Charter, it's not something that can be either ignored or dispensed.   You're not from that generation , you need to understand what that meant to the fighters and the people on the ground. Go spend a couple of days with one of the old Cadres and try to understand what they went through.    We have not sold that this is the type of government we need to voters.

Now one is arguing that policies and politics have an effect, but put enough people together an organisations and there will be politicos in both macro/micro senses. I've sat in on CEO meetings where big fortune 500 companies have junked an entire Six Sigma methodology because the previous CEO did it and the new CEO wants to make a name for himself. Same can be said for sustainability and green targets.   It's not a state v private thing. It's just the way humans run organisations.   As for things like BEE, Cadre Deployment and such efforts, we know the theoretical and moral reason they were done, we also know why they didn't offer the return that they promised.

As for qualified ponder this:   Most of the Chancellors of the Exchequer of the UK haven't been economists. George Osborne has one degree, and it's in History. In fact, if you look at the history of the UK most Ministers and Prime Ministers have zero qualification for their jobs even in the 20th century.

Women are given a bit more leeway in that there is no specific cut-off point in what is or is not formal. However, based on the given info I'd say jeans would not be appropriate. Any kind of client/3rd party facing staff would generally either go for a dress or smart trousers. I'd also suggest going with slightly raised shoes (though high heels / spikes are unnecessary unless preferred by you). Flat shoes might be fine too though.  You can obviously get away with something more casual, but its likely to result in you being taken a little less serious to be honest.

They had a policy in place to prefer Virtuals over Physicals, and were trying to get as rid of as many client servers as possible. Quite a few Naspers-owned companies do host, but most of the critical stuff (DSTV mobile, etc, etc) are on physicals. There's no doubt that internally they also lost data.  Knowing some of the guys responsible, a feeling deep down makes me think that they lost a storage node and are just too uninterested to recover it. There are backups, but maybe not for private customers."

southafrica,3dqpkg,ValiantMe,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"If I buy a server then I pay for all the hardware, whether I use it or not. If the 3 guys next to me do the same thing, then there's probably a lot of wastage because it's unlikely that all of us are using all the resources all the time.   So we can rather share the physical resources between us, where we each get a virtual server, but they all run over may e 2 machines. Then I can use (and pay for) half a server usually, but if I need a whole one, then I temporarily get more resources while someone else isn't using them.   It give me more flexibility and works out cheaper and better and usually more reliable because if hardware breaks they just move my virtual server onto a different physical one.   I install my programs on a virtual hard drive and all my files go there and that's just a file on the actual hard drive - each of the virtual machines have their own drive and that's how space is shared between everyone on the same physical machine.   MWeb Business just deleted/lost everyone's virtual drives, so all our data is gone forever. Just like all their customers."

Many nursing opportunities and you'll see a lot and learn a lot in government hospitals., also at many high quality private hospitals. 2. The Job market is good but you will need to check with the South Africa Nursing Council (SANC) if your qualifications are valid in South Africa. There may be a crossover exam. 3. Permanent work includes medical aid, pension,a reasonable salary and uniform. Agency/session work is a reasonable salary but no benefits. 4. I work in emergency medicine at a private clinic and the standards are very high. I work part-time and enjoy the challenges and variety. 5. Some of the work mates have lower standards , i would like to be able to earn more. I've left studying further a bit late.

The fact is that different diets affect metabolism differently, which also changes the bodies energy requirements.

While what you say is correct, cal-in-cal-out is usually used to tell people that it is relatively easy to lose weight. The fact of the matter is that due to the way most of our processed food is prepared, it is extremely difficult to maintain that balance.

southafrica,3dkyd2,totalcoxx,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"Do you have any information about how this went down - the arguments for and against world bank / IMF involvement and how it was decided?  As far as I know the majority within ANC leadership wanted to take IMF money, but Mbeki advised Mandela against it, and Mandela basically vetoed the decision. I'm sure it wasn't as simple as this though.  However it happened - we should be very grateful - IMF / World bank is not there to ""help"". It's there to make money and ""guide"" policy -- not my uninformed rambling -- UNISA economics professor said the same thing."
southafrica,3dkyd2,gooigooi,6,Fri Jul 17 09:28:16 2015 UTC,"At the time I had a ringside seat, working as a foreign correspondent. I got to meet pretty much everyone involved - Nkosi Johnson, Zakie Achmat, the UN's Hiv emissary Stephen Lewis and, all the way to the other camp, denialists like Peter Duesberg. I also met with drug companies with products to shift, activists and so on. The one guy I could never speak with was Mbeki. He only ever spoke from a podium or via his blog. Seldom did he speak to the media.   However, it seems clear that he believed that going into debt to fight aids would pull SA into a poverty trap. And Mbeki firmly believed poverty was the single biggest killer of Africans, not any one disease. Add to that a conspiracy theory that whites were looking to trip up a new black government, and you had a recipe for defensive policy.   There was merit to his argument. I recall in the late 1990s one UN representative telling anyone who would listen that SA needed to spend US$10 billion immediately on diagnostic and monitoring kits. That was before any treatment itself was paid for. Which at that point was thousands of dollars a month per patient.    In the early 1990s when the science was poorly understood Mbeki was able to convince his colleagues to support him on avoiding loans to fight the disease.  Later, as the sheer number of dead and dying, coupled with growing awareness campaigns began to turn opinion against him, Mbeki appointed Manto as his health minister. In her he had a perfect buffer who took much of the heat and refused against all evidence to tackle the problem.   By the time medication began to flow in 2003, when a court order compelled the government to provide ARTs, it was kind of moot. Generics had become available at a fraction of the price and awareness campaigns meant a declining infection rate.   No question Mbeki saved us taking on billions of dollars in debt. But whether he needed to actively deny the existence of the disease to do so, is up for debate. I believe he could have found a middle ground - one that took a more compassionate view and acknowledged the pandemic (as Botswana did) while pursing treatment options that did not destroy our economy.  Apologies for the long post - kinda got wrapped up in it."
southafrica,3dkyd2,Hairy_Psalms_,2,Fri Jul 17 11:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, great to see some actual insight on reddit, not just opinion.   I might be thinking about earlier events - before Mbeki was president. When the socialist groupings in the ANC pushed for World bank funds to be used to jumpstart the country after apartheid (i.e. general poverty alleviation and infrastructure development) but Mbeki (and other ""junior"" members) advised the leadership at the time not to take it."
southafrica,3dkyd2,gooigooi,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how that came about as I wasn't following it directly then. But, my overall impression is that after the ANC's unbanning the returning exiles were held in awe by the hardscrabble MDM people and even the Robbin Islanders.   The exiles had degrees, were accomplished debaters and strategists, and had navigated the rough seas of revolutionary politics. At a time when policy and an administration was being built from scratch, they had big advantage over their less polished counterparts that had stayed in SA."

southafrica,3dk4hn,movaid7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:14 2015 UTC,"You can essentially buy yourself out of your contract, according the the consumer protection act every contract has a buy out clause (that could be up to 10% of each month you have left in your contract) is additional charges if you're financing your handset as well. So let's say you took out a contract that cost you R400 a month & you still have 12 months left and ontop of that you loaded the deal with your phone fee adding an extra R150 to your monthly fee. You essentially pay in an agreed percentage amount owing on the R4800 you still owe on your contract and then they could turn to you and say you'd need to settle the full amount of your handset which is emerald the costly bit. But essentially since the inception of the CPA every contract should have a buy out clause or opt out clause protecting you as a consumer. It doesn't mean the clause has to actually make sense to you or be favourable for you in anyway.  But you should be able to buy yourself out of it if you really want to.

southafrica,3dhqci,sweetlifeofawiseman,6,Thu Jul 16 11:31:49 2015 UTC,+1 on Uber - I'd also reckon I would feel safer in an Uber and it's much easier and convenient. I am not sure if you'd have to change settings.

southafrica,3dhqci,gordoh,5,Thu Jul 16 11:40:23 2015 UTC,"Werent the taxi'''''s striking against Uber just the other day? I don't know if that is the safest option. I would recommend hire a car. Metered taxis are such a rip off. Hell, for 800 bucks I would drive you to the lion park lol!"
southafrica,3dhqci,Hairy_Psalms_,3,Thu Jul 16 12:00:18 2015 UTC,"At that rate you are better off hiring a car at OR Tambo. But if you prefer not to drive, I'd suggest Uber."
southafrica,3dhqci,jozithrowZAway,4,Thu Jul 16 11:11:10 2015 UTC,"you can also ask your hotel for a shuttle (could work out cheaper than a taxi) but the way Uber is going it'll be unsure if it'll still be operating in SA by December (or operating legally) we seem to be experiencing taxi difficulties in...sorry I mean technical difficulties in SA. & until the whole thing has been settled & legislation has been put in place to regulate & blah blah, the whole existence of Uber or rather the legality of it is in question. So my recommendation would be IF Uber is still operating & legal use it, if it's not enquire with your hotel for a shuttle that can be added to your bill on checkout. but also the metered taxi's at R400 is average (that is a pretty average fair, I paid about R300 each way from nearby the airport to Parkhurst) depending on the distance but I'd say most meter taxi companies you're looking in the region of R13-R15 per km (although could be slightly more) since you're only in JHB for a day I'd try to tap into whatever hotel you're staying at & request shuttle, it may be cheaper than meter taxi although not 100% certain,"
southafrica,3dhqci,redshoefeet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, was going to suggest this. Most hotels have a tame small tour operator or cab driver who will quote you a day rate. My in-laws found someone like this one year and used to hire him to drive them all around the peninsula on day trips. They're normally a lot cheaper."
southafrica,3dhqci,UysVentura,3,Fri Jul 17 12:15:24 2015 UTC,"In most cases Uber seems cheaper than metered taxis. I remember reading somewhere that some guy ubered from sandton to hartbeespoort (same road, twice the distance as the lion park) for R400, but I can't find that quote now so there is the possibility I'm just imagining it."

southafrica,3dhqci,BornInTheRSA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:34:22 2015 UTC,"Uber charges per kilometer, as well as per minute, so yes it costs more during peak hours but not because they are deliberately doing so, just because traffic makes it take longer than usual."

southafrica,3dhqci,exptl,3,Thu Jul 16 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Another vote for taking Uber but just remember this: The lion park is designed as a drive-through activity, so if you take a taxi / Uber there, you will have to pay for an organised tour through the enclosures, so remember to check their site and add it to the budget!  (They probably call these 'game drives' because they have some antelope chilling in the outer camps as well).  You can see some stuff on foot, but if you're coming all the way to South Africa you really might as well get the best you can out of it!  If you think you'll be using Uber a few times, you might want to consider buying a South African sim card - just remember you'll need your passport and some form of proof of address - a utility bill is the usual doc we use so bring one with if you think you might want a sim card. (You can also rent them from the airport, apparently its not too overpriced).  Also, shout if you have any other SA q's :-)"
southafrica,3dhqci,munky82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:17 2015 UTC,Thanks!   I did have one question on Gautrains. The only time I plan on using it is when I leave to go to the airport via the yellow line. I read that a Gold Card is needed to ride the train but where do I buy it? Would I need to buy it regular working hours or can I get it any time. I plan on taking the train early morning (8am).   Thanks again.
southafrica,3dhqci,ZeeyardSA,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"Every Gautrain station has vending machines and ticket booths that dispense the card.. If you plan to use a Gautrain bus keep in mind to keep a few rands on the card because no cash is handled on the buses. The Gautrain is safe, clean, affordable and world class (us Gautengers are quite proud of it).  Link about RICA regarding cellphone SIM cards"

southafrica,3dh4gc,WolfSpinach,5,Fri Jul 17 08:39:04 2015 UTC,"I've only done the trip once for my sister's 21st but it reignited my interest in seeing South Africa outside the main cities. It was really beautiful. The first leg of our trip was a straight run to Alexandria (near PE, not the other one) for a hike so I don't have much to say about that.  The way back was great. We overnighted in Kareedouw which is an old lumber town. It's got one of those half-way to everywhere feels, but if you need a place to overnight near Storm's River it seemed full of little b&b's. Lady who ran the place assumed we were bungie jumpers because that's about the only industry :)  We went to Tsitsikamma National park, there are nice walk's that are very manageable and really magnificent at the mouth of the Storm's. The Tsitsikamma Wolf Project is something I've been wanting to see for years and I really enjoyed it - it's sad but I felt that the wolves and coyotes had the best life they could have and it was super interesting. On the way back, we took R62 so we made the ubiquitous stop at Ronnie's Sex Shop. In case you don't know the story, it's a padstal named Ronnie's Shop that wasn't doing great business until one of his friends graffitied ""SEX"" into the name and now it does roaring trade. Burgers were good. We made a day-time stop, don't know what it's like at night (there were hundred's of bras hanging off the ceiling in the bar, so maybe not your parents scene :)  If you've got a good car, trying and take some of the passes. They're amazing. We were in a Polo and I wasn't sure we make it (we did, but the ride felt a little hairy at points). I can't remember specific names but Swartberg Pass near Oudtshoorn is on most people's lists."

southafrica,3dh4gc,aerodrome_,2,Thu Jul 16 08:01:23 2015 UTC,"If you were in something bigger, I would've suggested crossing the Outeniqua on the R339 from Uniondale to Knysna. It's just under 100km of dirt road, but incredibly beautiful. You could do it in a small car (I did it 6 months ago), but it'll probably be unpleasant for your folks.  5 days...it's almost not enough.   Is your dad into history? Kimberley itself is a shithole, but there's a huge amount of history there. Not only the diamonds, but the battlefields in the surrounding areas. Magersfontein has been converted to a war memorial and is a must-see. A stop-off at Kimberley obviously reduces your time at the coast.   There's some interesting stuff around the Gariep Dam, including the remnants of a concentration camp that Emily Hobhouse spent a lot of time caring after interned Boers. When I drive down to the Garden Route I always stay at (Morning Glory Cottages)[http://morningglorycottages.co.za/], situated on a working stud farm (Nguni, Thoroughbreds, Merinos, etc). Insanely good food.   The area between Wilderness and Knysna deserves a day or two. If you can be there on a Saturday morning, the Wild Oats Market in Sedgefield is almost legendary. Personally, I'm not too fond of the areas between Plett and PE, other than for hiking. I love Wilderness.  Route 62, as /u/WolfSpinach mentioned, is worth a drive at least once in one's life."
southafrica,3dh4gc,exptl,2,Thu Jul 16 08:24:33 2015 UTC,5 days isn't enough :)
southafrica,3dh4gc,exptl,2,Thu Jul 16 08:28:02 2015 UTC,"I did this, and as /u/mamparra mentions, 5 days isn't enough... unless you plan on driving all the way to the cape in 1 shot and spending 4 days driving around Tsitsikamma. Tsitsikamma is nice, but you'll ruin it if you feel pressured to get there quickly.  The road trip itself from JHB is incredible. Sleep at Bloem, Graaf-Reniet, Wilderness (George), then make your way towards Knysna. You'll be relaxed by not driving more than a few hundred km a stretch, and the roads are actually pretty decent too."
southafrica,3dh4gc,exptl,2,Thu Jul 16 09:17:32 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Just to prove that you can do a 'touristy' drive from JHB to CT in 5 days, here's the route my dad, my brother and I took over December: http://imgur.com/Rj1mGUE  and if you do some scrolling down on my instagram profile you'll see that it was the mother of all beautiful trips (seriously, my favourite road trip to date and I do this for a living :-P  )  This was, however, definitely a ""bakkie"" trip -  some nasty roads (which we loved 'cause we saw no other cars).  So, assuming you'll be in a normal car until you tell us otherwise, there are some great suggestions from everyone else. I'll give you my personal idea of a nice route, but really its up to you to decide what interest you and pick 'n choose. 5 days isn't enough to do everything, but on the other hand this means you really can only stop at the stuff that Really interests you :-)  I would skip the Free State on this trip - most of the 'interests' here are either historic points, but they're far between so create major detours, or 'active' - e.g. hiking rafting mountain biking. Oh and Clarens / Golden Gate national park - fun, interesting, beautiful, totally wrong direction :-P    So I'd zoom out on the N1 past Bloem (4 - 5 hrs), get the city well and truly behind you, and then start exploring South. Gariep is a popular stop, and quite scenic. Roughly 7 hours (600km) out of Joburg, a long first day but brings you in range of the good stuff.  Day 2, I would do either the 300km to Graaf Reinett (beautiful historic little town in the Valley of Desolation) or I would head on (450km) and stay the Old Jail in Willowmore - less historic, still a pretty drive, but more my personal interest :)  Day 3, you're now within 200 - 400km (depending on where you stayed) from Tsitsikamma. This lush foresty coastline is totally amazing, so you might want to spend night 3 and 4 here, and do the 600km on to Cape Town on Day 5.  Alternatively, Prince Albert or Swellendam are pretty towns to break the drive if you don't want another long push. The Swartberg pass to Prince Albert is breathtaking, and the R62 between Barrydale and Montagu is an amazingly beautiful piece of road.  I've done CT - JHB numerous times, on trips ranging from 1 day to 8 days, and I still haven't explored every possible 'good route' :) It's really up to your interests!"

Obviously if you met her while travelling that's not really a concern but if this is an internet romance you want to be safe."

southafrica,3dfrtq,Zarinole,9,Thu Jul 16 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll be the one to say it: this is a bad idea. Looking at your post history and your question on minimum age I'm guessing that you're still in school and will be turning 18 shortly or just recently turned 18. Going after a girl you met online is not the right reason to be doing this trip at your age."
southafrica,3dfrtq,masonjamoona,2,Thu Jul 16 09:10:55 2015 UTC,"I actually thought that perhaps OP had met her while she was on a school  trip or something. But, the consensus here appears to be that they met online :).  Either way, it is kinda cool that people give this much of a shit about something.  If a person is able, then go for it I reckon. Although, it might be a little bit uncomfortable with her parents. Peeps up there are often a little more conservative (no offence to anyone from up there --- don't want to be painting everyone with a single brush), so one might need to do battle with that. With a trip like this, you are either going to be terribly pleased/happy with it, or terribly displeased/unhappy... guess there won't be a middle ground."

Although the trip to Italy didn't turn out romantic, I had one of the best experiences, a personal tour guide and ended up with a lifelong friend as a result.   If the basics checks out, he does a ton of research and he takes the necessary precautions (with plan b and c), even if the girl doesn't work out, it could very well turn out to be an adventure."

southafrica,3dfrtq,Bishopza,7,Fri Jul 17 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"Transport in SA, particularly up in Limpopo, is tricky.  Some peeps suggest Intercape, which is a good bus company, but they don't go to Mokopane (old name is Potgietersrus).  Greyhound is also pretty cool and they do head out there (see here).  You can get the Gautrain directly from OR Tambo to Park Station in Central Johannesburg, where the bus departs from.  The buses typically run late and are very often jam-packed with people travelling to Polokwane (old name Pietersburg). Also, park station may seem a bit daunting initially.  There are usually tons of people standing about and it might not feel safe, but just keep sight of your stuff at all times and hang around the bus company area.  Nowadays I usually rent cars when travelling up there. It is far more pleasant than the packed buses with all their funky smells and you won't be beholden to the terrible schedule of bus companies ---  I took a bus from Joburg to Musina once and the 8 hour trip took 12 hours (over only 600km). On another occasion, someone slept through their stop in a city and we turned around 100km later to return and drop them off.  This might all seem absurd to our friends in Cape Town, where I live now incidently, but things are incredibly different Up North (it is also totally awesome in it's own way).  Car rental is also cheaper if you take the car for longer than three days and if you are a tourist (so you can cash in there).  The minimum driving age in the country is 18 but I suspect that there might be additional charges when renting if you are younger than 23 or 25 (this is for insurance purposes which may be waived if you pay with a credit card, but I'm not sure; I recommend you simply call one of the companies and find out). The trip from Joburg to Potties (Potgietersrus/Mokopane) is nice and short in South African terms (248km, 2h20) and will be a nice drive (the bus is 4hours, +- another 4 hours :), but at least you can stare out of the window).  As for accommodation, I'm afraid that I've only been to Mokopane a handful of times, and have not stayed the night.  I would suggest you look into guest houses or bed and breakfasts as the town isn't really a hotel type place.  I recently stayed in Rustenburg and used a combination of Trip Advisor and Google Maps to find places.    All and All, SA is quite sorted in comparison to some of our more rugged neighbours, so you'll probably be fine with most things.  Good luck, hope you get it all sorted, and enjoy your stay! :D"
southafrica,3dfrtq,aerodrome_,3,Thu Jul 16 06:24:09 2015 UTC,"Good advice here.  I currently live in Johannesburg and personally I would much rather hire myself a car and drive up to Limpopo than to use the bus system. It is the N1 all the way, which is a major highway and in good repair. You also go past places like Bela Bela which is nice for a quick stop over for lunch. A quick search shows a price of around R2000 for a week hire of a VW Polo ( through Avis ). That is only 150 Euro. I have no idea what the bus ticket + Gautrain would cost.  Also, once you are in Mokopane and staying in the hotel, how are you going to get to the girl's house every day? Unless she will be doing the driving around town... I would not depend on any form of public transport in the town itself, having your own car will give you a lot more options and freedom.  For accommodation, check out Safarinow, you can usually find a decent B&B through them.  http://www.safarinow.com/destinations/mokopane-(potgietersrus)/hub.aspx  Feel free to ask or send a private message if you need any help :)"

southafrica,3dfrtq,RedHerringxx,4,Thu Jul 16 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"In the start I looked into bus routes, and also found a firm going from Johannesburg to the town she lives in, but later read that public transport by bus is not ideal? Can someone elaborate on that?   Der er flere former for offentlig eller semioffentlig transport i Gauteng, som er den provins Johannesburg ligger i. Det mest brugte og velkendte bliver kaldt en ""taxi"" hernede, men er reelt en minibus med plads til 10-12 passagerer, eller hvor mange man nu ellers kan få plads til i sådan en. Den hvide del af befolkningen hernede vil fortælle dig, at denne form for transport kun er for de sorte. Det, de højst sandsynligt mener er, at hvis du er velhavende (i forhold til de lokale er kontanthjælp i Danmark at være velhavende), så er der høj sandsynlighed for, at du vil blive udsat for røveri. Hvor sandt dette er, det ved jeg ikke, men det er dog sandt, at jeg i de mange år jeg har har boet her endnu ikke har set en hvid person i en sådan taxi. Om disse forhold også gør sig gældende for langdistancesbusser, det ved jeg ikke.   Should I rent a car even though the only transport I plan on doing, is from Johannesburg to the town and then from the town and back, I plan on staying for a week ish.   Personligt ville jeg sige ja, hvis du har pengene til det. Det giver dig øget sikkerhed og frihed, og det er ikke så dyrt igen at leje en bil hernede, men helt billigt er det heller ikke.   I read somewhere I don't need to apply for a Visa if I'm staying for less than 90 days?   Dette er korrekt. Når du ankommer i OR Tambo-lufthavnen, så stil dig i den kø der hedder ""visa exempt countries"". Det er den helt til højre, og den kan være lidt svær at se indgangen til indtil du kommer helt tæt på.   Also if anyone know if I am required to get any vaccinations?   Hvis du skal til Limpopo, så begynder du at komme tæt på områder, hvor der er fare for smitte med malaria. Mig bekendt er der ikke nogen vaccine imod malaria, og risikoen for at blive smittet er meget lav medmindre I besøger Kruger National Park. Jeg vil dog anbefale, at du spørger din læge.  Jeg kan også anbefale, at du tegner en rejsesygeforsikring. Kommer du til skade eller har brug for lægehjælp uden en sådan en, så er der 0 hjælp fra den danske stat - alt er på egen regning, og du skal ikke regne med, at et hospital vil tage dig ind medmindre du kan fremvise en forsikring eller masser af penge.   I have looked around for things to be aware of whilst visiting, such as being aware ones belongings when walking the street, but I honestly always am no matter where I go.   Tyveri og røveri er langt mere udbredt hernede end i Danmark og resten af Europa, så det er ikke helt det samme.   But is there something else to always look out for? Good rules of thumb when visiting?   Jeg vil helst ikke male fanden på væggen, for selvom der er langt mere kriminalitet hernede, så er chancen for at blive udsat for det dog stadig relativt beskeden hvis du kun er her i en uge. Uden at forsøge at skræmme for meget, så er her nogle simple råd:   Undgå at gå udenfor til fods efter mørkets frembrud. Det bliver mørkt omkring kl. 18-19 her i Gauteng, i Limpopo er der nok en lille forskel. Når du kører bil efter mørkets frembrud, så rul dit vindue 1-2cm ned, men ikke mere end det. Det gør det sværere at smadre ruden, men giver samtidigt ikke nok plads til, at man kan skubbe en hånd ind. Når du holder ved rødt lys efter mørkets frembrud, så vær ekstra opmærksom på hvad der sker omkring dig, specielt om der kommer folk bagfra eller fra siden. Undgå at køre igennem townships, og undlad at stoppe (eller lade dig stoppe) i en township. Undgå at ligne en turist. Nemmere sagt end gjort, men... Hav så få værdigenstande med dig som muligt. Vis dem ikke frem. Lad være med at tage din telefon op af lommen hele tiden, eller overhovedet. Lad dig ikke distrahere eller påvirke af folk, der prøver at få din opmærksomhed. For det første forstår du helt sikkert alligevel ikke den lokale engelske dialekt/accent, men der er også chance for, at det bare er en afledningsmanøvre.    Also if anyone have any good suggestions as to hotels (Limpopo, Mokopane), it would be great to get some reccomendations as there wasn't alot constructive on Google.   ""Guest houses"" er meget normale hernede. Det er folk med store huse der har konverteret et eller flere rum/bygninger til hotellignende værelser. Der er typisk 3-6 værelser et sådan sted, og typisk har du mulighed for at få morgenmad også. Prøv at taste ""guest house near <hvor end du skal være>"" ind i Google Maps.  Men frem for alt: Nyd rejsen, din heldige satan ;) Sydafrika er et fantastisk land at opleve."

Som du nævnte angående vaccinationer og malaria, har jeg i sinde at kontakte min læge i en nær fremtid, for at gøre mig 100% klar over hvordan og hvorledes. Læste i en anden kommentar at jeg burde tage malaria piller med, så det vil jeg også undersøge nærmere.   Undgå at ligne en turist. Nemmere sagt end gjort, men...

I'm not sure about rental though. I randomly checked one company's terms and conditions, and they require a driver's license of at least three years. I'm sure I've seen other companies that will only rent to people aged >25yrs."
southafrica,3dfrtq,magicfanman,4,Thu Jul 16 08:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've seen that before as well. You need to be over 25, have had your drivers licence for more than 2 years, and have a credit card in your own name."

In the Limpopo area, there are not many people who speak english as their first language so communication and travel arrangements may even be more difficult. My recommendation would be that if you do trust this person to have them meet you and arrange the travellling. Unless its a surprise."
southafrica,3dfrtq,pwstraton,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:50:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about visas and such but I can maybe give some info on the transport. Yeah you have to be 18 to drive here but that's because you can only get your driver license when you are 18 (or 16 if it's a learners for a bike/scooter I think). However, if it's a far journey it's better not to rent a car and to use a bus. Buuuut not just any bus, the kind you buy a ticket for online beforehand for a specific long distance journey. It's not ideal to use the minibus taxis because... lot's of reasons. And it's not ideal to use a normal bus because they don't really go that kind of distance. I've used a company/service called Intercape before going long distance (it was a full day's journey).  Yeah belongings in the street... a lot of foreigners I've spoken to don't believe me when I say how dangerous it is to flash a phone or some money around here. Some areas are not safe and even in the safe ones in broad daylight you would want to avoid having loose money or a wallet in your hand (or a fancy phone, maybe go inside a store to answer it if you must). I think it's common sense but others don't. Just, be careful (like you say you are).  General things? Um... yeah I stay in Cape Town so I don't know much about the ongoings up that side of the country (Joburg, Limpopo), just thought I'd give a word on using Intercape, they've been a great help to me and my friends when we needed to get across the country and didn't have cars/petrol money for that long trip.

southafrica,3de6ch,Konsalik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:27 2015 UTC,A bursted tire could be the only possible reason for a driver to lose control of a vehicle as this one did. They'd have no reason to fire anywhere else.

southafrica,3de6ch,WillyPete,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Only now did I notice it, seeing how the glass breaks when playing it at a quarter of the speed. The cops get formal training (I live near a police academy I've been to) so that cop had to have had some exceptionally poor training to have shot another car (which was in the complete opposite direction, mind you). I understand your point though, but what would you do?"
southafrica,3de6ch,XiperOfficial,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:07:11 2015 UTC,I guess the SA cops wouldn't be stupid enough to get alongside them due to the prevalence of bigger guns.    The standard tactic would be to get on the inside of them in a turn and hit the rear 3/4 to cause a more controlled and predictable skid and flip.    A shotgun would be preferable in their circumstances though. A pistol is just too inaccurate.
southafrica,3de6ch,WillyPete,2,Thu Jul 16 07:24:47 2015 UTC,"Talking about inaccuracy, it seems like the policeman driver is the one doing the shooting at 0:50.  Surely it would make more sense for the passenger to be firing?  He would be closer and not preoccupied with driving the car."

southafrica,3dd7np,NoNameMonkey,2,Thu Jul 16 06:47:46 2015 UTC,"Here is the submission I made:  I, as a citizen of South Africa, am responding to the invitation for public comment on the FPB’s draft Online Regulation Policy (ORP)  Under the Apartheid administration we lived under a state of constant censorship where the government endeavoured to control not only what we could read or see, but also what we ourselves could say.   My experience of growing up under Apartheid has made me sceptical of any government policy to regain that ability.    As with any law or policy, we must consider not only what the FPB’s intention is today but must consider what power the ORP gives future governments to regulate the Internet.  I wish to clearly state that I do not support this policy in any form, or any other policy in which the FPB assert the right or arbitrarily classify or control the distribution of online content.   The ORP will negatively influence my right to freedom of speech and place an unreasonable burden on ISPs, content providers and creators, thereby worsening the digital divide between the rich and poor as well as damaging our creative and ICT sectors.  While I acknowledge the freedom of speech is not absolute, it is the mark of a maturing democracy where we learn to accept others voices even when we fear or find offensive.  I call on the FPB to scrap the ORP.  It is simply too easy for the ORP to become a tool to limit the freedom the Internet gives in the name of “saving even one child” and it is no secret that governments around the world have used that as an excuse to suppress their people and their voices.  The focus should rather be placed on educating children and parents on the dangers of the internet and how to browse safely."

southafrica,3ddr60,Feeltheblood,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair , most people would rather read the opinion than the statistics. When the economists do come forward they tend to just get ignored anyway. Very few people could actually properly understand or keep track of the statistics in this day and age I suspect."
southafrica,3ddr60,moarlurkin,3,Wed Jul 15 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the guy's a doos and all, but I wouldn't say the economy has tumbled. In fact, I'm seeing more construction and innovation now than ever before, really. I'd say it's more like ""stifled growth"" - we've been growing, but it's really too slow, and we have the potential to be far better off."

southafrica,3dcq81,cynicaltechie,10,Wed Jul 15 06:24:17 2015 UTC,"Update:   A Good Samaritan has paid off the university debt of Sello Molewa, the graduate without degree whom the Mail & Guardian reported about last week.   http://mg.co.za/article/2015-07-15-student-punished-for-being-poor-gets-debt-paid"
southafrica,3dcq81,UysVentura,10,Wed Jul 15 06:55:02 2015 UTC,"The more I hear about NSFAS, the more it sounds like a broken system. I've got a young intern programmer working for me. The guy is really sharp and hardworking. He also got two distinctions in matric, one for maths and one for English first language. Somehow though, he didn't qualify for NSFAS and couldn't afford to study a degree full time. Something to do with his mom making ""enough"" money. I wish I had the funds, as I'd love to send this guy to university. We're currently looking into student loans for him."
southafrica,3dcq81,Druyx,3,Wed Jul 15 06:59:52 2015 UTC,Yeah you can't get it even if your single mom works in admin . Most students trick the system by using their grannies or some unemployed family member.   Usually cops don't mind stamping their affidavites. It's really a failed system as it's easy to get it illegally but hard to get it legally even if your family can't make ends meet.
southafrica,3dcq81,Mr_Anderssen,5,Wed Jul 15 08:36:06 2015 UTC,I wonder if the university staff responsible for this are happy to wait the full term to pay off their houses or cars before the banks hand it over to them.
southafrica,3dcq81,Ska-jayjay,4,Wed Jul 15 06:33:56 2015 UTC,With houses and cars the bank can always repossess an asset. What other option do the uni's have? Trust in blind faith?
southafrica,3dcq81,ruggeryoda,4,Wed Jul 15 07:39:15 2015 UTC,Give them the degree and then garnish their salary once they've got a job?
southafrica,3dcq81,ctnguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:02:23 2015 UTC,If they can find one...
southafrica,3dcq81,ruggeryoda,4,Wed Jul 15 08:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well, without the degree they definitely won't find one, and the university still won't get its money."
southafrica,3dcq81,ctnguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:48:01 2015 UTC,Many people make careers (not just jobs) out of what they do. And many of these people don't have degrees.
southafrica,3dcq81,WpPrRz_,3,Wed Jul 15 12:33:26 2015 UTC,It's not really that hard to find a job in SA with a degree

southafrica,3dcq81,Ska-jayjay,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:02 2015 UTC,"I was about to comment that perhaps universities don't consider student accounts to be credit accounts, but then I remembered that my university charges interest on overdue accounts."
southafrica,3dcq81,mattsains,3,Wed Jul 15 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"Universities get away with a lot of shit. They provide credit but are not financial institutions, provide housing with no legal lease agreements and provide internet access without being members of the ISPA (there are one or two exceptions to that last part)."
southafrica,3dcq81,Konsalik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:08:55 2015 UTC,And if they dont we have students flipping out that the Uni doesnt care
southafrica,3dcq81,NoNameMonkey,3,Wed Jul 15 11:16:12 2015 UTC,"This happened to me too. Luckily I had a family member that could sign surety for the bank loan.  Uni's wouldn't, of course, have to do this if graduates would actually honour their debts after getting their degrees."
southafrica,3dcq81,ruggeryoda,3,Wed Jul 15 07:22:00 2015 UTC,"This is not about the graduate honouring his debts, but rather a failure of NSFAS."
southafrica,3dcq81,UysVentura,2,Wed Jul 15 07:34:04 2015 UTC,Not this specific graduate - the ones before him.
southafrica,3dcq81,ruggeryoda,2,Wed Jul 15 07:37:07 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
southafrica,3dcq81,UysVentura,3,Wed Jul 15 07:40:25 2015 UTC,It's pretty standard practice that you can't graduate until you've settled your tuition fees unless the fin assistance specifically provides for a delay.
southafrica,3dcq81,AnomalyNexus,2,Wed Jul 15 12:09:36 2015 UTC,"While allowing students to be educated at the cost of the university is a risk they are taking, they are in full control of whether they want to continue to educate the students whilst money is owed and they can bar you from attaining your certificate. Not paying the university is a risk the student takes. Nobody told the student to become impoverished by his own neglect. Pay, or agree to pay the university until the outstanding amount is paid in full. Don't complain about the problem. Show the creditor that you're doing your best to pay them what you owe them, and they might consider releasing the certificate. If the university denied that you graduated (with or without debt) then it is another story. This is what hinders people's ability to grow, they always complain about external factors rather than looking at changing themselves. I am disgusted that someone would pay for this guy's debt. He showed no originality and all he did was complain about the problem. This is why the country is in the state that it is in. People think the government and everyone owes them - which is not the reality. Every institution that educates people is a BUSINESS. Not a charity."
southafrica,3dcq81,WpPrRz_,2,Wed Jul 15 12:28:52 2015 UTC,Nobody told the student to become impoverished by his own neglect.   I genuinely don't get what you're saying here?
southafrica,3dcq81,UysVentura,3,Wed Jul 15 13:08:30 2015 UTC,"In the article he blames the university for him not being able to get a job. The fault does not lie with the university. The fault lies with the student.  EDIT: Don't get me wrong here, I was more than privileged to rather deal with a bank instead of with the institute directly. The institute can hold back on graduating you and releasing your qualifications. The bank on the other hand cannot. The student in the article clearly did not take his debt seriously. It's simple. While I'm still paying off my student loan I've made it my mission to find a part time job during my studies and I've made it my mission to pay my bank more once I started working permanently. Perhaps if the man approached his situation differently, he wouldn't have had the need to indirectly beg for money so he can start a life. My honest, and extremely critical opinion is that he won't get far in life."
