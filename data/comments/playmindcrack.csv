playmindcrack,3e6erc,chuck2354,5,Wed Jul 22 08:48:00 2015 UTC,"If the game is a large one and so expected to last a while, I'll often take some of the initial cobble supply and use it to ""pave"" the immediate chest area.  No dirt there, no flowers.  Important against invaders, too.  Plus it has the bonus that the cobble can't be used to make 10-high walls you're forever taking fall damage and running out of food points from!  /s  Edit: Oh, and before you jump to conclusions on any chest breakage make sure they're not just moving it.  Lots of players including me will sometimes move chests that are in the way.  The most annoying and frequent form of ""team griefing"" for me is one player taking a stack of bread for themselves when it could have kept the entire team going for ten minutes.  I don't know how on earth you stop that.  It's never once been put back when I've asked for it to be."

playmindcrack,3e02wc,bright_2,2,Wed Jul 22 01:30:06 2015 UTC,Personally I like the Snow Mountain best. Something about the two teams appeals to me more than the other map.
playmindcrack,3e02wc,Lost-Chord,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"both maps have their positives and negatives. Snow mountain is more fun (and easier) with secret tunnels and whatnot and you can't dig into bases, but at the time time Spawn is almost impossible to protect and there isn't as much room to set up defenses.  Meanwhile, Grass valley allows for larger games, but the layout of the resource points makes it harder to clear out mobs if left unchecked for too long."

playmindcrack,3e02wc,Imhotep0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think Grass Valley overall.  I think because I tend to enjoy the larger games more, and Snow Mountain seems to play better smaller.  I used to have issues with the three-sided aspect, but I'm used to it now and enjoying it for what it is.  However, I am having fun doing the sneaks currently.  I've had a lot more success on Snow Mountain, dirt or no dirt.  I think maybe because if you can get into the first wall on Snow Mountain undetected, you're already almost on top of the point.  One good distraction -- ghasts are best.  everybody looks UP! -- and you're in.  So I've chosen Snow Mountain a bit more often because of that."

The best he would offer is some kind of ""don't ask/don't tell"" on the issue: you could use it, but if you ever admitted it (or showed it in a video, anything), you were gone.  I hated that; for too many of us it was a choice between playing as a conscious rule-breaker and not playing (or playing at impossible fps) at all -- all over an issue of performance.  There was a mechanic in DvZ that an optifine setting could disable; this is likely the reason he was so vehement about it.  But personally I couldn't play DvZ at all with the computer I had then, so it felt like massive frustration for nothing."

playmindcrack,3dk0wk,stefanloos,7,Thu Jul 16 23:15:11 2015 UTC,If I am not mistaken the optifine ban started as a dvz thing.  I think Rob thought you could turn off the potion effects which would have made things like the torch blindness ineffective.  However it was never the case regardless.  They lifted the optifine ban a long time ago.
playmindcrack,3dk0wk,Shellz8bellz,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Compared to the total amount of players that have logged in, and been active in the past, the number of bans is tiny.

playmindcrack,3dj8s7,Philiquaz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:42:47 2015 UTC,I understand that it takes a lot of time and such. Is it possible to replace (using a command) all blocks underneath a barrierblock to stone? I dont know if such thing is possible because i dont know anything about commands.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,croswat,7,Thu Jul 16 12:19:45 2015 UTC,"I can see death messages get spammy in big games with 15+ players on all team there's almost a constant flow of death messages but in smaller and medium sized games the death messages are a really helpful way for you to tell what's happening on the rest of the map. The same person just killed 3 people, probably capturing their base. That guy onmy team that said he was gonne get food just died, someone else will probably have to get some food now. That guy that's been building your wall the whole game just died, someone is attacking your base,go back and help them. Thease are just some examples of how the messages can be helpful so unless you can toggle it depending on the amount of players in the game or after a set amount of time I would prefer them staying in the game.       Besides this the only problem I have is that instead of it being the person that captured the last point of a team that gets the players it's whoever took down the most points, for example if blue teamgets red down 7 points green team can't capture red team until they have repaired their bae up to atleast 6 unless they want to give all red players to blue team and thus loosing the game. It seems most logical that the person that is on the point is the one that catured them and not someone dead that did most of the work weakening them.        EDIT: adding to the old comment, the startup timer is way too short. After one game ends you barely have any time to join a new game before it starts and since you don't get your startup resorces if you join late you should atleast have some time to join but even after this is fixed increasing the timer to 1 miunte wouldn't spam chat so much in pregame and even better would be if the timer didn't start until you have enough players like in msg."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Sanjisama,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:59 2015 UTC,Something that would be cool is a killfeed at the right/left side of the screen. With for example  RemcoBluB -|--- Sanjisama  The thing in the middle would be a picture of an iron sword (weapon which is used in the kill) and the names are the color of the team.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,RemcoBluB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:16:13 2015 UTC,So would it be better if we showed kills from your team?
playmindcrack,3dhws0,t3hero,6,Thu Jul 16 22:41:10 2015 UTC,I really like the kill messages. I want to know if one of my team mates got killed by someone so I know and I can go fight them. I also want to know if I kill someone with my bow.  TBH I want death messages. They were fine the way they were.  Edit: If you could you could make it a toggle thing or make the death messages show up at the right of the screen. Don't remove them. This is a PVP game. Death messages are a key thing of pvp games.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BreeZaps,2,Fri Jul 17 00:31:41 2015 UTC,I missed having full messages a lot in the game I played earlier.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:07:15 2015 UTC,That would be better but you might still want to see when your teammates die.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Sanjisama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"well, kills involving your team members. I really dont see a good reason for you to see two other team's killing each other. If you want to know if their base is being captured, just look at the scoreboard."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,t3hero,3,Fri Jul 17 02:52:11 2015 UTC,I don't really care about blue killing green when you're on red etc but at that point it feels easier to just show all messages than tracking everything involving your team.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Sanjisama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:43:40 2015 UTC,"The ones I most want are the ones involving myself, to be honest.  Sometimes I don't know what killed me, and would like to.  More directly game-related, too often when I've killed someone with a bow, I have no idea.  They're hanging out on the top of a hill behind a tree, or behind a wall or some such, and after the hit I don't know whether they're gone."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,6,Sun Jul 19 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:   The only flowers that should explode should be the Aurey Flowers (poppy). Ones already existing on the map(s) should be removed. Revert the resource points speeding up. It doesn't help a game finished if it goes on too long- it simply means everyone gets resources and slows things down. As well as getting hectic, messy, and spamming chat. Leaderboards we could do with: Wheat gathered, Gravel mined, Wood chopped, Bases captured. I'd love some way of determining if a resource point was captured, but that's rather difficult. All for the purpose of promoting some game aspects. As of right now, I believe being in spectator mode counts you in when a base is taken; so if green takes blue with 1 player, but red has 2 spectators above the base, red takes the point. This is pretty much a bug. We really need to deepen the dirt in snow mountain."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Philiquaz,6,Thu Jul 16 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of a bunch of diamonds spawning in chests, maybe have it so that however many chestplates + swords spawn in chests (and maybe less frequently pants and boots) so that we can avoid those people who take all the diamonds and make full armor without sharing."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,taraforest,5,Thu Jul 16 12:53:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say add blast protection books. I've seen a lot of people complain about how ""op"" flowers and explosives bows are. Neither should be changed. The only gripe I have with either is that explosives bows are the only weapon in the game that can one-shot a player in full diamond, and considering how often they are misused (in 1v1s rather than on a group of opposing players or a wall) this is a frustrating thing to deal with. Adding blast protection books gives players a chance at fighting those with a super strong weapon such as the explosives bow."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,AunkMC,6,Thu Jul 16 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"Buying upgrades is pointless because you only get them if you're in the ""lobby"" when the game starts and when there are enough players (6-9) the game starts almost immediatly (0-30 seconds). Anyone who joins when the game has started doesn't get anything from their upgrades. To fix this the timer should work kind of like in Blackbeard, where the timer starts when there are enough players. The timer should be at 120 seconds to make sure that everyone who wants to play gets to join.  Stone buttons should be available since the enemy can just shoot arrows on wooden buttons. (You can't have regular stone which means you can't craft stone buttons). You could have stone buttons be craftable using cobblestone or if you put mortar on wooden buttons they turn into stone.  When there are only 2 teams left and someone wins, the losing team shouldn't be put on the winning team. It's a bit confusing seeing everyone on the same team in the post-game chat."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Ekketlol,5,Sun Jul 19 14:41:37 2015 UTC,The post-game is too short. I was barely able to say gg and compliment their nice unprotected stair to their base.   I think all games should have the post-game time that missile wars has or maybe a little bit shorter
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Ekketlol,5,Thu Jul 16 22:18:11 2015 UTC,The drop mechanic really needs to be looked into. As of right now the only thing it does is cause rage for me. I don't know if I'm just horribly unlucky but when i die i lose anything of value on me every time. I rarely respawn with weapons or tools and any armor i have past leather is always gone. It is the thing that i hate the most about this game.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,chuck2354,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:59:42 2015 UTC,One solution: don't take the stuff of value. :P  I'm almost serious; it's surprising sometimes what you can do with complete crap.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,2,Fri Jul 17 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"In the game i am currently in i have died twice so far. The first time i died it took the diamond sword and chestplate i had on me, my bow and a 3 quarters of the iron ore and ingots i had in my inventory.(small note all of this i acquired from the enemies chests) the second time it took the diamond sword i picked up off someone and the diamond armor piece they also dropped, my stone sword and my bow. both times it left the single piece of dirt spider eye and stick in my inventory. Something is screwed up here"

playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,5,Fri Jul 17 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think that there should be a FOOD kit, because bread isn't enough :P"
playmindcrack,3dhws0,justinthelew11,2,Fri Jul 17 12:00:14 2015 UTC,agreed. maybe start with 10 or 15 steak/pork and upgrade from their?
playmindcrack,3dhws0,VintageDrummer1,5,Sat Jul 18 01:36:07 2015 UTC,Just a few more thoughts here. The amount of coal in the quarry I think needs to be increased or it should be added to the resource points. Its true you can grind out charcoal but that's really tedious and no one wants to do it seeing as you spend half the game cutting down trees and smelting stuff. Also the orange wool relic needs to be changed or removed. I've had several games now where jimmy pulls it out of a chest and right clicks it trying to figure out what it is and destroys out teams chests and kills a half a dozen players just because they don't know what it is. If i get it anymore i just keep it on me and never put it into the chests so this doesn't happen.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,chuck2354,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:07 2015 UTC,What does the orange wool thing do?
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,2,Sun Jul 19 13:02:31 2015 UTC,Gives you a speed boost but you explode after like 5 seconds.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,chuck2354,9,Sun Jul 19 14:35:04 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a tweak to the food.  You should be able to stay in the field a little longer than you are right now without hoarding a dozen pieces of bread for yourself (and potentially losing them all).  Possibilities: Increase food haunches per loaf; increase saturation; remove the thing in 1.8 that makes it take up saturation to heal; make it so you always respawn with full food bar/full saturation (nothing like respawning down 5 food haunches and having to use up three bread just to go anywhere!).  I think that doing this might help pushes succeed a little more often and so help the stalemate issue, too."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"I can understand why they don't let people re-spawn with food though, since you can just constantly rush with basic armour otherwise! I do agree it needs fixing, but I like the spawn hunger reflecting the hunger you had at death."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,bright_2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:37 2015 UTC,I think they should provide a better food like cooked pork or something as a resource drop.  That with the bread being made should be enough.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Shellz8bellz,3,Thu Jul 16 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"There used to be cooked porkchops in resource points and the wheat was actually in your base, it was changed to allow starving out a team as a strategy. Not actually sure why pork chops got removed from RP"
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:25 2015 UTC,I think that anything that could be an advantage over another team like that should be in the resource points.  Its something very minor but could absolutely cause a push.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Antbob,5,Fri Jul 17 00:23:04 2015 UTC,I think that if it was possible to make a leaderboard for bread crafted to encourage people to go get bread instead of just complaining about we don't have bread or we need bread. Imo I don't like removing death messages because they are very useful when your base is being captured and you want to know if the person died or not.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,SteampunkMittens,3,Thu Jul 16 15:28:24 2015 UTC,"Can already tell you now that if this were a thing, people would ignore bases and fight over the wheat areas so they can get higher onto boards. :P  There'd undoubtedly be players just standing around collecting inventories full of wheat and not helping the team go to fight.   Any leaderboard should be for things which actually help the objective, and can't be done without actually being useful."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:31 2015 UTC,Idk you have to craft it which means you have to go back to base so I doubt that.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,SteampunkMittens,3,Thu Jul 16 17:00:24 2015 UTC,On the snow map there's a crafting table in the central building. And players can place crafting tables on the stairs by the resource points on grass valley.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:04 2015 UTC,Right but placing crafting tables requires taking it with you.  I dont know about anyone else but I always go back to the base regardless.  I just think were underestimating people.  Yes people can be title greedy but for the most part people play the game how its made to be played.  Plus one person staying by the wheat constantly is only going to get them killed eventually then that hard work is worth nothing not even a title.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,SteampunkMittens,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:20 2015 UTC,I just don't think making a leaderboard for something is the right way to go about encouraging people to work as a team.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well they are going to make leaderboards I am sure and its going to be things like kills and captures but most games have a kind of ""extra"" title.  Like brawler, spartacus, dvz was grave digger.  That extra title could be fun for those that arent good pvpers.  Cookie had the fishing leaderboard."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,SteampunkMittens,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not doubting that there will be leaderboards, but it should probably be for something a little less simple, making bread isn't exactly a challenge, it's just expected of people. And being on a leaderboard for it isn't something people could brag about either in my opinion.  Edit: With the amount of prefixes in chat currently I can't help but feel like titles might just make everything look even more spammy, and in a team game where communication is necessary that could get confusing."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Antbob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:22 2015 UTC,Also people would have to bring it back to the base otherwise people would just get annoyed at them.
playmindcrack,3dhws0,BlueCyann,2,Thu Jul 16 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"Speaking personally when I mention bread in chat, it's not necessarily a complaint and it doesn't mean I'm not going to go get it myself.  It's meant as alert to anyone who doesn't know already that we're running out, particularly to anyone who happens to be near the wheat to begin with.  Edit: and sometimes I mention it as a reason why our team can't rush when someone (who's probably holding all the wheat we have left) is demanding it.  Like, help me get some wheat for the rest of us first or you're on your own, buddy."
playmindcrack,3dhws0,bright_2,3,Thu Jul 16 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough, I guess a lot of people are so used to people demanding food. I'm sure as the game matures people will get better but it is frustrating when you see people asking multiple times for bread!"

playmindcrack,3dhws0,TinkerTech,3,Sat Jul 18 02:23:34 2015 UTC,This game is improved immenesly with Mumble; one of the best games I've played was using mumble. Is there a way to make players more aware of it to improve communication in matches?
playmindcrack,3dhws0,bright_2,4,Thu Jul 16 14:27:01 2015 UTC,The mumble is not official so it's not promoted. This is the correct thing to do IMO since it's too hard for PMC to actively moderate official chat rooms
playmindcrack,3dhws0,chuck2354,3,Thu Jul 16 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"Personally I think food needs a buff in the larger games. If you have 15 plus people on your team go get a stack of bread it lasts maybe 5 mins before its completely gone, and back to people complaining in all caps about having no food. Is there any way to make it so more than one wheat drops if the player count is high, add food to the resource drops, or just expand the wheat fields in general to make getting wheat quicker?"
playmindcrack,3dhws0,Ekketlol,2,Thu Jul 16 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"5 minutes for a whole stack of bread? Wow, In one of my games I got 2 stacks of bread that lasted about 10 seconds. People don't know how to share"

So like in the Grass Valley map there are three teams. When one team is captured all of those members are put onto the team who captured them. The other team then gets out number'd. When people join for the first time of that game, they get put onto the team with the least amount of players.  Have a chance for the bread to drop to pieces of wheat. Maybe like 15% chance."

There's no way to be cautious against something you can't predict or guard against that can one-shot you.  Also, given they're not really THAT OP against defenses, most people are using them purely for PVP.  Which is not as intended anyway.  I'd like to see the explosive damage for players way nerfed somehow."

I'm not sure if there's an easy way to fix that because of the amount of people who are regularly and actively playing in the beta.  Another thing I have noticed, is that Orange Wool is capable of destroying shrine blocks.

People always ALWAYS steal way too much food so you get stuck with your 'fair' share. Increase coal found in the mine Have voice notifications when your base / another team's base is being captured so people pay attention and help out Make explosive bows even better at breaking into bases but decrease the number of times that each resource point spawns new bows Have another way to get arrows The map starts with some basic defences already built so that people have something to work from Make chat easier to read, communication is key. I think turning off the patron white text is a good start Create narrow time windows every 30 minutes where everyone has their health buffed or something to make LAZY JIMMIES attack. People spend too much time with their thumb up their bum not contributing.   EDIT: WHERE ARE MY DOT POINTS!  EDIT: Is it possible to get customisation like DvZ had?

playmindcrack,3dhws0,bright_2,2,Thu Jul 16 12:33:52 2015 UTC,A strategy common in the closed beta was to have a chest of gear inside the respawn cave.

My reasoning is that in long games where all teams take a hit to their base health, the captured base goes to full health- no problem yet. But then, if the smaller team does succeed in capturing the original enemy's base, the enemy will recap immediately and it will return to full health- this makes it incredibly difficult for the smaller team to scrape a win.  This change would simply mean that there is a feasible chance for the small team to win, as the bases don't have to be whittled down simultaneously.  So far, I've only been in one game where the smaller team has survived, and this dynamic has led to the game feeling over as soon as one team is captured- and people begin playing it as such. This means that the game drags out as players on the larger team just run in with stone tools instead of continuing the normal game.  Just sayin"

It was our original base that we wound up losing.  But they were down to their last player by the time that happened, so we got it back immediately and were then defending again with two full-health points compared to the opponent's single one that was halfway down or more."

I'm not quite sure when the all list broke, I can give it a quick poke and see if it's a small amount of work.  As for your ideas, we're trying to reduce the number of commands used, rather then shorten commands we'd rather give you different ways of interacting with subsystems like friends.  Collections of friends will likely just be a nightmare to interact with in client, it'd be command heavy and likely used by few.  Cross server chat, oh lofty goals, it'd be neat sure. It's the kind of thing you need to be careful with, for example, we specifically prevent spectators in MSG being able to talk to competitors... we'd have to make sure this did too.

playmindcrack,3df5ft,Sharnier,12,Wed Jul 15 20:00:36 2015 UTC,Pro Dev Tip  Iron doors are you friend. You can get iron doors by either crafting them or using mortar on normal doors. Just like stone brick iron doors have to be broken multiple times before they disappear.  What makes doors great for getting in and out of your base? Levers and buttons in your base only work for your teammates. Opponents aren't able to use buttons.  TLDR; Use iron doors and buttons for getting in and out of the base
playmindcrack,3df5ft,gyroninja,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:14 2015 UTC,This... is a pretty great dev tip.
playmindcrack,3df5ft,TheKid217,8,Thu Jul 16 04:09:14 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll add onto this originally, seeing as I agree with most of it.  Remember, this is a TEAM game. A team effort is required to win. If you aren't going to act like a team to your teammates, you can consider yourself a detriment to said team. Sitting at spawn complaining the game is going on so long is bad, start moving your butt and get out there and attack!  Whether your making your base easier to navigate, getting wood/charcoal, going to resource points and securing gear, 'leading' charges into an enemy teams base, just know that if you're doing something for the TEAM, then you're doing it... right, for lack of a better word.

playmindcrack,3df5ft,WintersLocke,6,Thu Jul 16 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"TIPS!  Baj's Spoon!  Baj's spoon is your friend and ultimate defensive utility item (almost made useless by design of the eff5 iron shovel). The best course of action when using this relic is to JUST dig gravel and nothing else, digging gravel by design doesn't use up durability, digging anything else however does and completely makes the item run out almost instantly.  Man Pants!  Man pants are fantastic way to get a huge pvp advantage over other players because it provides speed a constant speed 1, fire resistance , and 100% knock back resistance. Which basically means, you're almost immune to the confusion bow, immune to the fire grenade and remnants of explosive bows (which is fire by the way) and makes you almost impossible to combo hit. It's a fantastic item for 1v1s, but also has great synergy with the Chestplate of Justice (which gives you a constant strength 1 buff).  Please Remember to just throw away leather armor, stone shovels/axes, and bows  These items DO NOT need to be stored in your chests to clutter them even further than they most likely already are. You can just get a new item from the armor stands by right-clicking them.  Has your team ran out of swords? Grab an axe!  Taking am axe when your team is being overwhelmed and doing as much damage as possible to the enemies is the best course of action in this situation rather than wasting time looking through chests for gear, take action because you can do that later once your base is safe!"
playmindcrack,3df5ft,BBBence1111,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"My tip:   ORGANISED CHESTS AND PLAYERS  If you see a chest, that is half ful with books, then please don't dump your cobble in there. Look for the chest that has cobble/wood in it and use that. So much time gets wasted by looking around chests to see if there is something useful...  For players:   Get in groups and do something iuseful instead of complaining.    A group of five that does nothing but goes from res.point to res.   point and brings the loot to base.   3 people should always be on wood gathering duty.  Some people should stay in the mine.  Another group should do food runs. Some people on guard duty at the walls.   My point is that don't just stand aroun shoutig: ""FOOD"", get a group and grab some, or see where did our actual food-group go. I see a lot of people just running at an enemy base by themselves. They just die and we lose gear."
playmindcrack,3df5ft,BlueCyann,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:57:12 2015 UTC,"But you do have to be aggressive, at least on Grass Valley.  IMO one or two people taking solo runs at enemy bases is better than no one doing it, even if ideal would be a concerted push, even if they die almost every time.  Take leather, pick, shovel, basic weapons, minimum food, who knows you might get in at some point.  It wouldn't be the first time a base has been taken down like that, even in larger games.  The problem is that if you're on a team where no one will do that, and you can't get the big pushes going either, you're pretty much doomed.  Sooner or later one of the other two teams will make a capture."
playmindcrack,3df5ft,BBBence1111,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that noone should push, I just want them to do it smart.

If done smart, 1 or 2 people can hold them off from a point with bows, or take down their base bit by bit."
playmindcrack,3df5ft,BlueCyann,2,Sat Jul 18 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"I watched someone use up a half dozen explosive bows this morning trying to take out one enemy player and then another half dozen shooting up a resource point.  I wanted to cry.  Anyway, another tip:  If you're going anywhere near an enemy base, bring a stone pick.  Especially if you're the sneaky type.  You'll be amazed at what you can accomplish with the help of a distraction or two and the enemy's own built-up cover.  And a tip to help that tip:  As early in the game as possible, get some saplings and relocate them to right next to your supply area.  Wood runs out otherwise, pre-made picks (and swords) run out; and when you're headed off on a base raid, you probably don't bring one.  Then you die.  Also, the planks are very handy for smelting all that iron quick and easy.  Just replant the saplings."

playmindcrack,3df5ft,Sanjisama,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:48 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with everything besides the Camelot boards and just want to add one thing, you need to have an easy way for you team to get on your capture point in case there's someone on the base. If there's nothing but a ladder/staircase or a one wide hallway that leads onto the capture point even one person can fend of up to 3 people with a bow all by themselves. Some think leaving a way will just let the other teams get on the capture point more easily so it's a bad idea but in reality as long as you can kill them it doesn't matter that they got there and they can still get in with ladders or breaking the wall even without an entrance. Rant over."
playmindcrack,3df5ft,WintersLocke,7,Wed Jul 15 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"That's not a rant about walls.  THIS is a rant about walls.  If it were up to me, I would build no walls at all (at least not right at the point).  I'd dig a pit.  I don't know what's under the point at the moment or what the build rules are immediately adjacent, but hypothetically it could even be completely game-breaking to do this.  Dig down at least two blocks all around to the width that a player can jump, dig in so there's a lip everywhere and you're done.  No enemy player will ever stand on your point unless maybe they get thrown there by an explosion.  (Devs, if this is possible, you might want to address it, for example with a stepped bedrock slope.)  But even without that (if the enemy team could build, for example), I'd use a pit.  Walls block sight lines.  They make it impossible for a respawning player to shoot onto the point immediately (assuming they've retained their bow).  They make it far easier for the enemy to occupy the point with no one noticing.  They make you take fall damage, and if not built wide enough (as they often aren't; you need a minimum of 3-4 blocks), they're all but impossible to defend from either.  (The first time you get hit you're knocked off, and dodging takes too much concentration, not to fall.)  So yeah.  There's a reason that when I play defense on another server I won't name that has a lot of attack/defend type games, all the pros laugh at walls.  I don't actually want to get rid of them on Crack Attack; it's part of the charm.  (I've already seen some epic and functional builds, great stuff.)  So here's my own wish list for builders:  Always leave a decent way in  It's infinitely more important for defenders to have ready access to the point than it is to keep attackers out.  This means a ground level (or equivalent, depending how things have been built otherwise) opening or tunnel leading towards spawn.  Easy access to the top is also good (steps and/or ladders on the back side, for instance.)  But that can't replace the tunnel.  Don't build too high  About four blocks is fine in the immediate vicinity of the point.  Stick a lip on it to slow down laddering, you're done.  Any higher just wastes resources and slows down defenders trying to go over the top in an emergency when they can't get to, find, or create a ground level entrance in time.  Bad juju.  For that matter, high walls aren't all that great farther out either (trying to get back over them when your point is threatened is a pain), but we can't have everything.  All walls need width, particularly at the top  Archers need room to move and the freedom to dodge and take hits without falling off.  Otherwise they may as well not be there for all the good they do taking out enemy players before they sneak up and break in.  Three blocks at least, I'd think, wider is better.  Wider's good at the base, too, for obvious reasons.  You should build something somewhere to allow archers to shoot down on to the point  And this spot should be very VERY easy to access.  Obvious reasons.  Defenders can't destroy the occupation if they can't see it."
playmindcrack,3df5ft,pokepoke303,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"You bring up some great points, but there is an unbreakable stone layer just one block below the capture point so the pit strategy doesn't really work."

This makes control and collection of these resource points very important to winning the game.  For the base, mortar is important to turn the cobble into stone bricks (which take 3-4 times to mine before they disappear).

I'd like to start from the beginning of games and it seems like a lot of times by the time I get to another game after one has ended the next one starts already.  And I have a tendancy of getting distracted in lobbies saying hi and such.  Also perhaps making the minimum players be, lets say 15, might be better.  I've seen games start with 9 and thats less than an SG game, which doesn't seem right with a game like this."
playmindcrack,3db648,Shellz8bellz,2,Wed Jul 15 11:24:35 2015 UTC,I see both big and small games all the time. I personally like smaller ones
playmindcrack,3db648,Zac91142,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having both as well but from what it seems this game was designed to have 3 or 2 teams gather resources, build defenses and defend and attack.  With the short games I've played there wasn't even time to do that.  Not saying they should all be 2 hours long but they should be long enough to play the way it was made.  Or else why not just play sg?"
playmindcrack,3db648,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:26 2015 UTC,The small games progress and end way too fast. There are also games with way too many. It's finding the proper balance between games. And so far that hasn't really been done
playmindcrack,3db648,TinkerTech,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"Smaller games are good for people who may not have a lot of time to play on the PMC server; an hour, hour and a half compared to some other people. When some matches tend to stretch into the 2+ mark, short ones are nice. But not quite that short."
playmindcrack,3db648,Zac91142,2,Wed Jul 15 00:46:23 2015 UTC,I've had 3 games end in under 10 minutes. That's what I want to avoid. I think some games get too long because there are too many people

playmindcrack,3db648,chuck2354,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. CrackAttack in it's entirely is a massive balancing act so we're still actively tweaking stuff - as evidenced by the death timer reduction and such - and will be for the forseeable future. It'll be looked at in due time!
playmindcrack,3db648,Shellz8bellz,2,Wed Jul 15 00:04:20 2015 UTC,Something you could try to help long games end is to make the bases harder to regen the longer the game lasts.
playmindcrack,3db648,Bitjump,2,Wed Jul 15 06:46:42 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I dont think the time played really has much to do with the it being an extensively crowded game, but rather the games end game.  There are a few adjustments to be made regarding that."
playmindcrack,3db648,Shellz8bellz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're trying to figure out the best ways to actually end games sensibly and adjust it so it remains fun but allows for proper winning moves to be made so any feedback is legitimately really useful. The initial timer tweak was an attempt, but the death downtime just made the game less fun."
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,_Rogue_Shadow_,6,Wed Jul 15 01:55:36 2015 UTC,Personally i think explosive bows should be able to damage terrain and not players. If you are attempting to take a base one jimmy with an explosive bow can kill your entire attack force just by shooting the middle of the capture point. At least decrease the splash damage from them a bit.
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,chuck2354,3,Wed Jul 15 04:03:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, but i think that their should still be an explosion, hence the name ""Explosive Bow"""
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,VintageDrummer1,2,Wed Jul 15 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking an explosion that only affects players."
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,VintageDrummer1,2,Wed Jul 15 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"That would be cool, but i think the fire should still be in if thats possible...it gives it more of an ""explosion"" type of feel"

playmindcrack,3dbwvk,Shellz8bellz,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:32 2015 UTC,That's true :P
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,Philiquaz,3,Wed Jul 15 02:18:39 2015 UTC,Some items are supposed to be overpowered(when used right) because there definitely needs to be some way to end the game. I'm sure some of you have experienced stalemate games where everything is too balanced.
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,BlueCyann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:12:11 2015 UTC,Good point. Pretty much all of the games I've played have been a stalemate. I just find it annoying that one small move can instantly end the game pretty much.
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,Sanjisama,2,Wed Jul 15 14:14:41 2015 UTC,Sure thats a point but the number of times ive been blown up by an explosive arrow versus a flower is huge.  But arrows I believe should do what they do personally.  They should be able to damage terrain and damage the players.  Not that minecraft is at all like rl but if it was the case it very obviously does both.  Maybe make the explosions smaller.  Maybe make it just 1 bow that spawns at a time that has a couple of shots.  There are ways to balance it all out and I'm sure with time the devs will figure it out.
playmindcrack,3dbwvk,BlueCyann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:51:41 2015 UTC,I actually like the idea of only one bow that spawns.

Invasions on your own very rarely succeed, and probably will succeed even less once they balance it a little."
playmindcrack,3d6o68,vintermann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just hope players will be more inclined to work together and coordinate since this game relies on these aspects but minecraft (and their playerbase) isn't  exactly known for high-depth coordination. You'd see this play style in games like mount and blade, just hope that there will be enough players playing cooperativly to keep this game mode alive and interesting."

Is this a feature or bug? I think that teams should be able to get reconquered to turn the tide of the game. Otherwise whoever conquers the first team will win.  Another thought on this, when a team gets conquered, their respawn timer is still active, so they can easily get reconquered (this is how we did it). However, if teams are not meant to be reconquered, then I would suggest getting rid of or shortening the respawn timer after a team is conquered (only for the death cause by being conquered)."
playmindcrack,3d4qvz,Sanjisama,3,Mon Jul 13 14:50:55 2015 UTC,"This was always a feature and it's intended that you stay on the teamafter you've been captured, making people switch to a oposing team in the middle of a game is never a good idea. The game is made so it is pretty much game over as soon as the first team is captured because it would drag on for too long if it wasn't but it is still possible for the other team to win, I have played over 100 games and once but just once did the smaller team win but with the increased respawn timer it might be possible to do in smaler games now."

playmindcrack,3d27n8,Shellz8bellz,4,Mon Jul 13 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"I personally thinks the resources have to be bunked up, so attacking constantly is useless, because as that game showed you can go 2 hours of just straight up attacking one team (and at one point the two opposing teams were doing so) but we can still fight them off.  I should point out I know there are planned changes to the game, just nicely reinforcing  the message. All in all I fucking love Crack Attack, like it's my favourite game on the server.

playmindcrack,3d27n8,gyroninja,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about the respawn timer.  It is VERY long.  I don't think I like being taken out of the game for that length of time every death.  It punishes a concerted but failed push pretty brutally, for one thing (on top of the harsh penalties already in place for dying).  All of a sudden your whole team is out of action for a minute or more (once you factor in re-equipping).  And it's boring.  The fundamental issue with defense being so strong isn't the respawn timing, it's that the maps are so big at all.  It takes forever already for a player to cross the map to another team's base, so if an attack loses half its members breaking in it's going to have a hard time holding on whether it's facing defenders who are reappearing every 30 seconds or every 60.  Reinforcements won't be in time, either way.  I don't know how to fix that, though, without losing the maps (and their charm) themselves.  Giving players a slight speed boost might help (speed 1), but that changes pvp.  Maybe new maps could focus on being a bit smaller, or incorporate short-but-defensible routes from one base to another in addition to longer open paths as is mostly the case now."
playmindcrack,3d27n8,BlueCyann,2,Wed Jul 15 14:04:55 2015 UTC,"I personally thinks the resources have to be bunked up, so attacking constantly is useless   That was a design that we'd aimed for right from the get-go: You'd have to run in and have a battle between groups of people in order to win- Making a real clusterfuck of fun.  At the same time, we did realise that if people didn't cotton on, then games could drag out. Ironically, unbalancing the game became a priority as testing went on, as opposed to the normal demands of ""balance moar!""  Also, the upcoming changes that croswat has stated sound awesome."
playmindcrack,3d27n8,Philiquaz,3,Mon Jul 13 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"Suggestions from me:  Make the crafting/armour stands area less crowded, make it a bit bigger for more people.  Have some sort of feedback mechanism for when you take something from an armour stand, a sound effect, particles, something like that.  Change the [Dark_Purple] to something else.  I've a fan of like a gold 'G' and a purple 'P' as prefixes, so you know who's who, while avoiding making a fast moving chat look like a bad trip.  Spawn protection so people can't do this to your spawn point. http://labtec901.com/u/ko"

playmindcrack,3d27n8,Juliandroid98,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"Spawn protection (meaning no-build) for the spawn itself and no-destroy (if that's possible) for the armor stands area might be nice.  It would remove the issue with explosive damage from arrows that people are talking about in the other thread, without taking away the ability to destroy terrain.  (Which is the whole point of them, isn't it?  To break into a base?)  But I'm not sure yet that targeting chests should be prevented, to be honest.  Keeping the other team out is part of the point.  Thoguh i guess if people are doing it by bow shot from 100 blocks away that's an issue."
playmindcrack,3d27n8,BlueCyann,2,Wed Jul 15 13:55:12 2015 UTC,We're working on balances to increase snowballing for teams.

playmindcrack,3d27n8,BlueCyann,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"I really think this game needs changes, don't get me wrong, I love the concept, gather resources and special items from the capture points, and attack each other, but it is a bit too balanced. as games go on for as OP played, 2+ hours, but it's not ""fun"" 2+ hours, it's a tedious hoarding. with not much progress for each team.   I really wish that as the game goes on, there are some mechanics added to spice the game up as it goes into deep stalemate.   here are some suggestion  *Longer respawn times as game progresses: this is needed.   one big rush is ineffective because in 5 seconds time, the team getting rushed can zerg the rush, to just cancel it out, meaning the rush was pointless, and thus, adding another hour to the game.  *regening bases: this is ok,   it needs to regen as the team might not gather anyting and just rush with nothing to win. but it regens too fast, it regens too fast so the team cannot push the tides to their side, because it regens too fast..  *more mobs: this is a full PVP game, but I think it needs to depend on PVE to make it a bit more fun.   This game is as said, too balanced, making it a stalemate for both teams. there needs to be a moment when the table flips, but with constant respawning and fast base regen makes it impossible. when the table flips, it needs to flip fast, and for a successful capture, you need to ""spawn camp"" the other team, or the rush is failed. so another suggestion, have an item that you can use, to spwan mobs at their base when you rush, and the mobs, if you don't deal with it quick, will multiply, or get stonger. just so whoever is attacking can handle the respawning and regening base."

However, I will say after 20 minutes, there was basically no way of red team winning or turning the game around in any way. Blue point was controlled by green, yellow point was controlled by blue, and if we tried to enter central, we got crushed by players with better equipment.  I don't know if this was a lack of communication or something about the game itself, it being my first game."
playmindcrack,3d27n8,SteampunkMittens,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:15:55 2015 UTC,On the three team map I feel like once a team falls the game turns from capturing other people's it's then the last team's job to last as long as possible.  In the closed beta tests of the game we didn't have the teams stacked so the games would go on forever as each team traded bases with the other.
playmindcrack,3d27n8,BlueCyann,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the mechanic of giving the players of the team destroyed to the team that captured them. Its good, because by the time a team dies, the game should be almost over, and the whole ""last stand, can't win, but won't be defeated easily"" is really cool.  What happened was that, even before green captured blue, it felt like we were at a disadvantage because we hadn't taken from any resource points in the beginning, and so we always lost the fights for new resources, so we never really got any good iron. At no point did we acquire diamond, because the other two teams always won fights over the central.  The thing is, that being my first game, and only really able to see from the perspective of the red team, my perception was skewed. There was definitely equipment snowballing, which could be good or bad, but I don't know if we would actually have been able to win if we had tried harder, or if the game really was won within the first 30 minutes."
playmindcrack,3d27n8,SteampunkMittens,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"It was hard to organize our team throughout the match; early on because most of us weren't familiar with the game or the map, in the middle as we fought to balance offense, defense, and supply runs, and later as we got more people who weren't in the mumble chat to communicate. It was part communication and part teamwork. Still, we hung on to the very end!"
playmindcrack,3d27n8,Omnimetatron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:32:12 2015 UTC,"One thing which kind of bugs me and a few other players is the fact that upgrades only matter if you join at the very start (which you have 30 seconds to do usually if a game just ended), and only last a short amount of time. If you die early on you lose most of the equipment you've made with the upgrades, rendering them slightly useless.  If this is to be changed I'd hope that either players always spawn with their upgrades when they join games, or that the system is changed so that buying an arrow upgrade means you can collect more from the armour stands, and can collect more cobblestone from gravel, etc.  Also, I have yet to figure out why torches are purchasable/craftable/useful in any way, shape or form.  I've been enjoying it quite a lot though, the games are becoming more fun as players have begun to learn the mechanics and aren't hogging every resource to themselves as much."

playmindcrack,3d27n8,bright_2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:43 2015 UTC,"You need to have a team that knows what they're doing and how to communicate and organize through chat.  There's lots of new players right now who don't notice when their own base health is going down when they're standing right next to it.  Who build walls their own respawning players can't get over. Who don't make supply runs.  Good team is a lot of fun and easy to stay more or less organized; bad team forget it, I just get some arrows and go try to improve my aim somewhere once it's clear it's hopeless. But those games don't last long."
playmindcrack,3d0e6j,Arjenboy112,8,Sun Jul 12 13:06:06 2015 UTC,I gotta say... I really like this game.  Reminds me of classic dvz with an sg twist.  Games are a little long but I like the strategies that go with it.
playmindcrack,3d0e6j,Shellz8bellz,3,Sun Jul 12 17:50:08 2015 UTC,I think games will get shorter once people start working more as a team. In beta testing we had some games last only 20 minutes.

playmindcrack,3cjv78,coolpool2,2,Thu Jul 9 20:53:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'm basing most of this off of memory because I can't remember when the last time it was updated was. I need to double check a few of these things but here's what I remember. The goal of the game is to have the most points when the game ends by killing other players. Every player spawns with two weapons and a healing item. Each weapon is unique and has different attack strengths, mobility and mana costs. When you kill a player you get more points depending on how many points they had, and how close you are to the center of the arena. When a player is in first they are the king and have a crown on their head. When you kill a player you take some of their points, this makes it so that big comebacks can happen. Most weapons and healing items use up mana which regenerates over time. All weapons have a left click and right click function. The left click is the attack and the right click is usually a mobility function or a crowd control."

playmindcrack,3cjv78,lotloxa,2,Wed Jul 8 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"It's not a percentage, it's a flat amount. If someone has more points than you, then when you kill them, you will steal up to 10 points. Since there's no such thing as negative points, if someone doesn't have more than ten points, then you'll just get whatever amount they have and they'll drop to zero.   Killing someone with less points than you gives two points, and they will lose one point, meaning that the total amount of points in a game will be always increasing."

playmindcrack,3bvitk,Smokey_The_Lion,6,Thu Jul 2 14:22:56 2015 UTC,Just an FYI on how buying benefactor and patron works. As an example if you already have 10 days of patron left and you buy a month of benefactor. You will enjoy your benefactor for a month and once it expires you will still have 10 patron days left.  TLDR; If you buy benefactor you will not lose the patron days that you have bought.
playmindcrack,3bvitk,gyroninja,2,Thu Jul 2 20:19:25 2015 UTC,I have a question.  If we already have Patron and we go and buy this what happens? (Do you take half of the days from Patron and add it on Benefactor?)  This is good cause I spend too much money buying silver so this will be way better.
playmindcrack,3bvitk,BreeZaps,2,Thu Jul 2 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"They are separate things.  Benefactor takes precedent. So if you purchase Benefactor your Patron will ""go on pause"" until your Benefactor runs out, then it will resume until it runs out."

playmindcrack,3bvitk,Bitjump,2,Thu Jul 2 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into getting myself benefactor but would like an answer to my top question first to decide whether to get 1, 2 or 3 months.  The first question I asked to Bitjump on the server, but he didn't have an answer for me at the time but thought it might have been an oversight in updating the site. But previously patrons got 50% bonus experience from every game. Now the updated page doesn't mention that anymore, neither does it claim whether benefactors get even more bonus experience or not. So what's up with this? Did this feature get removed?  The second question actually leads into a suggestion ... Now since recently tab got fixed so normal users are white and patron cyan. Will benefactors be red soon in the tablist or will they remain cyan?  And my suggestion I want to mention on here:  It'd be nice if tab showed benefactors on top in red, followed by patrons in blue, followed by normal users in whatever colour. Because it doesn't really make sense to me it currently first will mention all regular users and then all the supporters. It kind of removes from the ""premium"" feeling, doesn't it?  A third question I want to ask is something I just started wondering about and the site has no clarifications about: Let's say I buy 90 days of benefactor and in a month or even an hour after buying that ... I buy another 90 days of benefactor ... do those numbers get added up to 180 or is it wasted money? So essentially my question is: to add time to my benefactor or patron, would I need to wait til the last day or until it runs out or can one just go ahead and add to it way sooner?  I'm asking given Sigils mentions patron can be put on hold from now on when buying benefactor essentially adding up in premium days.  I also feel like mentioning it surprises me there is no 120 or 180 days option still. I heard quite a few people asking for the possibility to have longer subscriptions."
playmindcrack,3bvitk,Agent-347,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:21 2015 UTC,"I do have answers for these questions now!  We removed the XP bonus a long time ago apparently and also removed mention of it on the website. This is because it went against EULA - given that XP directly affects Gold, which is a non-cosmetic game-affecting currency, we couldn't allow purchasable multipliers. I wasn't aware we had an XP multiplier in the first place, and this is because it was removed before I joined the team, hence why I had to clarify.  Benefactors will be red, yes! We kinda forgot about the tablist thing, and I have the code written, I just need to update it. I'll try and get round to it in the middle of Minecon preparation.  We can sort the serverlist, but it's a bit of a pain - it's currently sorted clientside. That's something I'll look into, but no promises.  It will add the days on top, it won't override them. No wasted money."

playmindcrack,3bowv6,lotloxa,6,Tue Jun 30 23:22:19 2015 UTC,"If we're turning this into a thoughts forum about the new update, I'll put my thoughts here too.     Additions:     Old Weapons: Bent Spoon   Loika's Lute   Staff of Jache   Unicorn Wand Tsue's Whirlwind      New Weapons: Blizzard Snowglobe (Left click - Shoots a slow moving, homing projectile that deals 5 hearts of damage. Right click - Draws everyone in a medium radius near you.) Healing Oak (Left click - Full heal, that gives slowness that inhibits movement. 5 second cooldown. Right click - Costs 35m. Grants regen 3 for 40 seconds.)   Boulderfist (Left click - Costs 30m. Summons several boulders that do 3 hearts in a small aoe. Can be used like a Mad Alchemist, but it does have a shorter duration. Right click - Costs 5m. Creates temporary wool platforms of varying rainbow colors.)        Removed Weapon - Galaxy Orb      Edited Weapons: Staff of Permalong (Can now see projectiles)   Crystal Flask (Charges lowered from 6 to 4, refill cooldown reduced from 30s to 20s)   Healing Ale (Heals 1.5 hearts per click)   Loika's Lute (Left click is no longer a channeled spell that shoots lighting, now after a three second delay, it shoots a glowing wither skull. That deals 3 hearts of damage, apples wither 2, and slowness for 40 seconds, and can destroy any block, besides bedrock, in a small radius from the explosion)   Bent Spoon (Right click has been changed from a random player swap, to a large aoe knock back with a twenty second cool down)   Staff of Jache (Right click mana locks for three seconds.) Staff of Permalong (Right click mana locks for one second.)        New Map - Frostbite     Known Bugs:     There is passive healing on the new Frostbite map. Fires never go away on the new Frostbite map.  Health scoreboard objective on the new map. (Bug or feature?)  Bandage glitching is still possible Blizzard Snowglobe's left click goes through blocks. Snowglobe's left click can only have one projectile traveling, and doesn't despawn till it hits someone. ( Bug or feature?)  Snowglobe's left click still costs mana when there is already one in flight.  Mad Alchemist can override the lute's wither 2. Unicorn wand's right click does not work.      Thoughts:    Now, everyone knows that ale is more powerful than the old flask, and most of us believe that the main way to balance it is to simply increase the mana cost. Since, right now, you can virtually heal through all sustained damage spells, even when someone is chaining, and either break even, or even gain mana from tanking the damage. So, even keeping the one to one ratio of mana to health, increasing it from 1 to 3 mana per heal, would prevent someone who is out of mana, and is on the brink of death, from just powering through everything.   Unlike some people, I really like the seed. It's especially good with Melee sets, since all of them have some form of built in tankyness, and the psuedoroot (It's a strong slow, but you can still move by jumping, like a golem in DVZ) on the left click means you can really still be dealing consistent damage after you fully healed. Effectively nullifying the main draw back of the heal. All mobility spells can also be used too, while you're ""rooted."" The right click does cost mana, unlike all other healing spells, so that's a draw back, but if you use it before committing to a fight, it is incredibly strong. Not as strong as ale, but good enough that you can easily stay in a the healthy range while killing others. It does have a long cooldown though, so try not to over commit. Over all, I think the healing oak is strong for anyone who can plan ahead. Its usefulness is dynamic, being a static full heal every five seconds that gives a moment of relative weakness, but I think it's circumstantial strength puts it as a contender with flask as the second best healing weapon.  Jache, lute, and Snowglobe, are all really unreliable when it comes to aiming at a target. Might be the reason why their base damages are so high, but I just dislike it.   Jache's right click is a great escape, though it does mana lock you, so I don't recommend using it too aggressively.   Getting hit by lute's projectile, if you have a bandage, is pretty much a death sentence, cause of how long the wither lasts and the slowness makes it harder for them to run away. The lute's mesmerize effect is intresting, I don't quite know how I feel about it. It makes everyone around you ""immune"" to damage and is a better root than oak, though you can nudge forward a bit by jumping still. :P I feel like it can be good for setting up combos, but I haven't gotten the chance to try that yet. The lute also has knock back resistance, and since it has pretty unreliable aim, this further cements it as being a secondary weapon to a Melee/short range spell.  Globe's projectile is annoying in that it's just crit particles. I personally don't think that something which can deal 5 hearts of damage in one blow, should be so hard to see. It should be clear that this slow moving little stream of white is a big threat! The right click can be used, in conjunction with other spells, to set up kills nicely. Though, I think the range is a bit too big, since I got pulled off upper ring, into the center, from a Snowglobe right click.  The boulder fist is intresting, it's like a passive aura of death. It's a large mana investment, that doesn't guarantee a kill, but can be strong if you can get close up to the target and let them do their thing. It can be used like a carpet bombing type thing, but the unicorn wand does it better, for less mana, and more projectiles. The right click is really intresting to me. Not only can it be used to set up a unique locations to snipe from, but it can be used to catch you from a meteor smash, it can be used to block line of sight and certain projectiles, it can be used to root people who get caught in the platform, setting up an opportunity to get close to the enemy. This is a very versatile spell and I think it's going to be intresting to see how people use it in new ways. I say, the boulderfist is the best weapon to come out of the update.  Tsue's whirlwind... Can't say much about this since I haven't gotten it yet :P I hear the jump boost it gives also negates fall damage, which is cool. I can say, it's annoying as hell. This invisible person walks up to you with just the item in you hand, and with projectiles and wizards flying everywhere, that can be hard to notice, and then it just flings you about with other people like a super fling.   And... The spoon. It's still the spoon, I still hate it.   Edit: Reddit formatting... How does it work? :P I can't get any of the bullet points or dashes to show up :/"

playmindcrack,3bowv6,squeekywheelMC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:05:01 2015 UTC,"Tsue's shirwind, I'll add some info about it as you didn't get it.  It still has the problem, and the reason it was removed, people didn't like fighting against it. and yes, it still is an extremely annoying weapon to fight against. left click can drain your mana quickly, but fall dmg and the base dmg can kill anyone quickly. people are stuck in the vortex, and when they are low and trying to escape, they can't, because the mana regens to 8 quite quickly, so you can pull them back to the vortex without any trouble. I don't like fighting against it, it's really annoying and hard to get away from, (the main reason it was REMOVED) and I don't like using it, it is really easy to get a kill..  Globe had a projectile? and the left click did something? wow, I never notice because there were so little particles... I was just swinging with it with no idea. This really needs more particles.   The healing oak is the not the best healing to have. because i have no idea what it tries to encourage. it fully heals in exchange for the speed and FOV drop. so it encourages to stay in battle, as it fully heals, but it makes it impossible by slowing you down. the 2nd really needs a buff, long cooldown, and a regen. which is still not the best, regening gives you reason to stay in battle, the long cooldown doesn't I really think weak regen should have low Cooldown and should be the left click ability, with full heal with absorbtion hearts should be the right click ability.  why was orb removed? it was a good item, not much wrong with it, it was extremely easy to counter and generally well balanced.   these are few of my opinion, few items need rebalance, as they don't seem great."
playmindcrack,3bowv6,redmadser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:39:36 2015 UTC,"I can't say I that this is the reason it was removed, but spoon originally was removed, because it was decided that the broken right click was too random and unfairly giving many players death. Orb was given a pass since it only affected you. So, it might be that reason? Honestly though, the orb's right click is really one of the best escapes if you knew how to use it.    The seed is really good in my opinion still :P It makes you absurdly tanky, and honestly, the ""root"" is still not as big of a draw back as you think. It wouldn't be good for chasing, but in a fight it still let's you out sustain a bandage or a flask. The regen three isn't strong enough for you to flat out tank everything like the ale is, but it's still a passive healing over time. Not only do you have a full heal up every five seconds, but the regen can help keep you topped off while you're waiting for it to come up. As I said before, it's better with a Melee weapon, since the root wouldn't really do anything when you're that close, and since they all bring additional forms of effective health."

Some of the new items appear to be broken, notably unicorn wand right click.  Most of the new weapons are pretty bad. Spoon is still good but Jache and Lute just seem like worse versions of corrupted flame. Snowglobe doesn't seem to do anything, the boulder one is pretty good, and unicorn is pretty good.  Bandage is just as bad as ever, healing oak is pretty bad for the same reasons as bandage, good to see flask has been nerfed.  I don't understand why galaxy was removed, but good to see permalong isn't invisible anymore.  OP combos are still OP, but healing ale seems to be the new flask in its OPness."

playmindcrack,3bowv6,squeekywheelMC,4,Wed Jul 1 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree with this and I think Waterinamelon said it best last year after spoon was removed due to the bugs in the right click feature after the 1.8 update. No one likes being one shot but KGM has always had other one shot opportunities like void star. The spoon requires more skill than most weapons and always was one of the most elegant an interesting parts of the game. Perhaps a cool down on the left click would help but it is also important to know that it isn't very dangerous if you have an escape and it is not really helpful against many other weapons including other spoons.  I'll miss the right click feature though. I always loved how much randomness it added to the game as you could never completely control your round with the threat of getting swapped at any minute.  Regardless, with all the changes I'm sure some balance tweaks will be in order and spoon may be worthy of some nerfing."
playmindcrack,3bowv6,redmadser,3,Wed Jul 1 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"it's just that it is hard to get oneshot by void star of corrupted flame, as you are fighting someone, and you expect a one shot, or you make a bad decision, but spoons can just throw someone out of nowhere, when they are so far away, and with no mobility weapons, there is no avoiding. which is not the case for other weapons."
playmindcrack,3bowv6,redmadser,2,Thu Jul 2 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"It just requires different tactics. Much like it is usually a bad idea to run around inside unless you have void and/or illusionary blade for fear of getting voided, running around outside without an escape makes you a spoon target. Spoon also doesn't counter spoon since it does not offer escape thus being outside with spoon is itself a risk.  That said, I just watched dragonbut's video with him using spoon while floating around with staff and jache and that's a pretty deadly combo if you have the skill to pull it off and don't run out of mana.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bzR9V3xzr4"

The update is great, and the spoon is definitely amazing to play with. My suggestion for the follow up update is to maybe bring back the galaxy orb with a different right click, like way the spoon glitched was fixed.  Also ale is ridiculously overpowered, you can basically tank anything spamming it.   Finally the poison is kind of weak and more annoying (it poisons slower but lasts longer)  anyways it is a great update."

I was wandering around near 0,0 when I saw a fly hacker. I immediately did /report and in about 5 minutes a mod showed up. This mod did his thing and spectated for a bit, but after a few minutes of doing nothing I said ""Its the Creeper guy flying around as you can see"" at which point the Mod rudely told me to not call out hackers in main chat. I decided to wait a minute or so more before asking if he was going to do anything. Again he told me to not call out hackers and to screw off. By now the flyer had killed a person and had turned to me. After a little bit I managed to dump lava on him resulting in his death. Right after the mod messaged ""there you go ;)"" and after I asked him if he got banned, the mod left. To this day he hasn't been banned and I still see him on the server."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Hurricane_Surge,27,Sat Jul 4 04:37:52 2015 UTC,"My only serious complaint about the moderation of the server is that it feels like all the moderation policies are designed for something different. PMC has a tendency to act as though it thinks it's a massive server with thousands of players to manage every day, or at least has a shot of becoming one, but in reality it's a reasonably small community composed mostly of people who spend hours on the server every day and many of whom have been playing on PMC since day one. The community's not confined to the server itself - far from it; so many people communicate with each other outside of the server more than they do on it. There are many real-life friendships and relationships which have spawned from the PMC community - this is not Mineplex, it is a largely close, intimate community and although there's always a few strangers showing their faces, they often don't stay. Those who do stay are absorbed into this unique community.  With all this in mind, the way PMC handles its moderation feels alien and clinical. Support responses, especially to ban appeals, are so distant and cold. There was a recent case where someone was banned for putting the DvZ IP in chat when someone asked where it had moved to (shan't link the debate over that, names needn't be dragged into this) - that is a prime example of a situation where moderators could have used either logic or soul rather than a rigid moderation policy, since anyone with a whiff of an IQ level can see that this is not some random kid coming and spamming the IP to their crappy P2W server. But rather than think ""oh, this regular player is being helpful, that's nice of them"", it's an instant ban and protracted appeal process - completely ignoring context and intent. (I can appreciate at this point it might seem like I'm still caught up in the drama of that particular incident - I'm not, it's just the first example that came to mind.)  It doesn't need to be like that when the majority of people who play regularly are seriously devoted to the server and to each other. The staff are always friendly with the community on reddit and Twitter, and are generally some of the most integrated members of the community.  On an unrelated note, I would suggest that highlighting mod/build team names in chat is something you should consider changing. Partly because I've never got the impression that staff consider that they're representing the server before they speak in chat (quite the opposite, but that's another rant in itself) and partly because most of the time it makes it seem like the server is inhabited only by moderators, which is generally a poor impression to give."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Tomlough,9,Tue Jun 30 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"I was actually banned for breaking the strict ""no linking"" rule as well for a silly link that lead nowhere, and while it would've been easy to submit an appeal and never think about it again, the way the ban was delivered sort of put me off. I still talk to some mods on a daily basis and play on a survival server that spawned from a friend group on PMC, I just don't play anymore."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Aperture_client,3,Wed Jul 1 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I've been saying in several of my responses.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,wwarcher,25,Thu Jul 2 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"Just from a personal point of view, my biggest issue with the moderation team is how downright unprofessional some have acted in public. I'm not asking for them to always capitalise and say please and thank you or any of that bollocks, but there are times when mods have flat out set bad examples. The most recent incident of this was when I played MSG a few days ago. I really don't play MSG much (not a game I enjoy greatly), but the only thing I see in chat of about a 20 person game is a bunch of people with mod and build team tags talking about teaming up to kill another group of players in the game, who is and who isn't kos (with all unknown players automatically kos and the group of friends consisting of those staff members and others not bein kos) and getting annoyed at people for 'potspamming'. As someone who very casually plays MSG, I understood the premise was 'kill everyone else however you can', but here I see a bunch of staff members talking about doing things that go against this and helping their own little group. Yes, I know teams and truces aren't against the MSG rules, but when you see a bunch of staff teaming up and declaring everyone apart from themselves kos it doesn't present a very good image. I've seen other examples of this slightly off behaviour from mods in public, like when a mod started complaining at me for killing them in KGM, and when a mod and their friend outright tried to team on me in a 3 player KGM game. All these are things I know aren't against the rules and you can't really get evidence for, but you should be able to expect better from the goddamn moderators of the server."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,ewokaro,9,Wed Jul 1 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not any of the people in the above post, nor the original poster.  (IGN renatak2)  I don't think I'm in a position to be able to comment on most of this, because I don't know anyone on the server well enough to do more than exchange a few words with.  Heck, I make comments in chat and half the time am ignored completely. :/  So whatever, regarding the personality conflicts and whether they do or do not rise to the level of behavior that mods should not engage in and keep their position.  I do want to say something about the hacking part.  I don't know whether the OP realizes it or not, but it can be really hard to say if someone is or is not hacking.  You're hit five times in one second in moving melee: autoclicker/kill aura, or lag?  I can't tell.  Someone hits you from 8 blocks away and proceeds to chain you to death.  A hacked client?  Probably not -- differing latencies causing you to get hit first while still too far away on your own client, followed by the inevitable aftermath.  I've watched videos of admitted hackers using kill aura and been barely able to see the indications of something being off -- sometimes I see nothing.  Which is all just to say that unless somebody is flying around, it is probably going to take some time for an observer to be certain enough to kick and ban the player.  Without implying that I approve of the kind of joking or other things you're talking about in your post, you do have to allow them that time.  I've played on other servers and have a basis of comparison -- a couple of games' worth of time is pretty damn good for the more subtle things.    It's not like there's no consequence if they're wrong, after all.  PMC being a one-strike server (something I am having certain issues with myself to be honest) leaves no room for error.  I know of at least one person banned for using a hacked client who was able to get himself reinstated by posting the entire video of the game in which he was banned.  What if he, like most people, didn't record at all?  Shit out of luck, and to all appearances, for no reason other than a mod's mistaken impression of what hacking looks like.  It's mandatory that they be careful."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,27,Tue Jun 30 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"I just woke up, so apologies if some of this doesn't make sense, but I feel I should clarify a few things.  If you don't want to read it all, i'll just quickly say to submit a ticket under ""general"" category if you have issues with any mods. You can do this anonymously if you're scared, but only me and Wes have access to that category.  Lets start with bans:  As you know, bans are made only if we have solid evidence. We have an online ban management system in place that holds all our bans and evidence, and it tracks everything. Everything is tracked, who added evidence, who banned, the ban duration, and so on...  So there's no way to cheat the system if you wanted to ""ban for a friend"". We even encourage the mods to share evidence in the mod skype chat if they aren't sure about something, and I have a big document of ""do we ban for that? and what punishment is it worth?"". There has been times when a mod added evidence to the ban system, but it was repealed as the senior mods weren't comfortable with the evidence, or didn't reach a unanimous decision whether or not it was a breach of rules. This has been pretty rare however, but they do occur, and in almost all cases, the user isn't banned. We have a policy of ""if we're not 100% sure, don't ban"".  Appeals:  There's some misconceptions with appeals here, which i'm not sure why is the case.... Appeals are only handled by the very senior of staff, 99% of the time it's Wes, or me. We're the only 2 that can actually see appeal tickets, so any sign of favoritism or ""unfair bans"" would pop up at this stage, and, as far as I know, there hasn't really been any. We do discuss appeals sometimes in the skype chats, when we want a group opinion on something, or just more opinions on the best way to act.  Tickets:  If you do need to share evidence with someone breaking rules, feel free to put in a ticket, I check those at least twice a day. There's 4 moderators that have access to the ""bans/moderation"" category, so if you're afraid of ""favoritism"" send evidence through there. As I stated before, if you have any issues with any mods or staff, send in a ticket in the ""general"" category, I'm the only one that checks that, and I don't care about ""favoritism"", i'll ban a mod if they break the rules.  mods - good vs bad:  Lots of discussion here about mods having friends and picking sides. I assure you that they don't care if you're friends with them, if you break the rules, they'll deal with it. I'll quote one of the mods: ""I'm harder on my friends because they should know better."" If you disagree with me (and have evidence) send in a ticket. I don't trust word of mouth.   Mod Applications:  People are spreading weird rumors in this post about how mods were chosen, let me share the specifics.  There has been 3 rounds of moderator applications:  Round 1, 2013 - Before PMC started Wes asked for applications on twitter, and that's how the core group of mods was added (those left are me, t3hero, monkeykingofnz, and alriandi)  Round 2, 2014 - This round was a ""we need a few more people, but we don't want to ask the public"". We looked at tickets and who has been helpful with /reports, and asked people from there, those that remain from that group include Sav, Econs and Zivodor.  Round 3, end of 2014 - This was the public cry for mods. We put up a google form and got about 220 responses. Me, Wes and olmok went through it and narrowed it down to 72 based off ages, and responses. I then stripped all the personal information from the applications, and shared it with the senior moderators, of which there was 8 at the time. The big factor was tickets/reports and how active there were in the past with the community and helping moderate. For example: thekid217 and djtalica are mods because they have helped a lot in the past with moderating (they both have 40+ tickets in the ticket system reporting people), and because they are active players.   specific responses:   Where were the mods and why was the hacker not getting banned? The mods were taking bets on how many people the hacker could kill and who could kill the hacker. A few times I’ve also left a game with a hacker in it, and been put into a lobby with numerous mods in it, just hanging out with their friends rather than going into said game and getting rid of the hacker.   I have a hard time believing this, considering the main consideration I had when going through mod applications was how helpful they have been with reporting and submitting evidence through tickets in the past, so I know a lot of the mods HATE hackers.   A few times I’ve also left a game with a hacker in it, and been put into a lobby with numerous mods in it, just hanging out with their friends rather than going into said game and getting rid of the hacker. I understand that the mods are just volunteers, however that doesn’t mean that they can just slack off, avoid their responsibilities, and ignore /report’s.   You know mods are volunteers, some of them spend more time moderating than people working full time jobs, they need to relax sometimes. People forget they used to be players. There's 28 moderators, so there's enough to rotate around, even if a few take breaks or are away for vacation.    Not only are they too quick to ban, they also do not even tell all the mods when they are about to ban.   Not all bans are reviewed by every Mod, it would simply take too long, the mods know that if they are 100% sure that someone broke the rules, they're free to ban. They also know that we review evidence every now and then, and when doing appeals, so if someone was banned for ""no reason"" it'd come up and that mod would be talked to.   Has anyone else noticed how most moderators are people who are on the leaderboards or are very ""popular"" among the community?Not only that, rumors has it that some moderators schmooze other staff members to become moderators. Jus bein' honest!   We actually have our own rules between moderation, rule number 4 is literally this: ""No romantic involvement between moderators will be tolerated. Sexual harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. We need you focusing on the server, not each other. If you wish to stay on the moderation team, find your partners elsewhere.""  This applies for all moderators, and between moderators and other staff members. If you want to know exactly how mods were chosen, scroll up."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,10,Tue Jun 30 22:49:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe a first step option on the appeal form along the lines of ""I'm not sure what I did wrong, can you be more specific"".    I know that it won't be an issue for most people, and I know that recipients of a bad fellowship ban are going to be assumed to be rather crappy people anyway, but speaking as one such recipient, and having spent rather a lot of effort in my appeal trying to address every possible ban reason I could think of in addition to the most probable one, just to cover all the bases  ... (deep breath)  Anyway, the guesswork is stressful, and I could see it turning some people off from appealing at all.  Maybe even people who would have been reinstated if they had appealed."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"I think you might be a little naive about the ability of your mod team to resist the ties of friendship or the effect of dislike of a certain player.  You're not choosing people, in the main, for previous experience moderating or for personality characteristics other than a willingness to protect the server in general. It's going to be hard to tell sometimes whether they're capable of protecting it against their own friends.  Even if 14 in a row send in reports on friends' behavior, what about the 15th?  What about the one who doesn't have any close friends on the server at all but might still have people she likes around her more and others she thinks are twits?  I was a mod a few years back of a game contest that ran monthly.  I've seen this type of thing in play.  When our system turned up a cheater we liked, and they protested, they were sometimes let go despite flaws in their arguments.  When it was someone we despised, nothing was given benefit of the doubt.  This is just human nature.  You can't stop it, and it happens in even in groups of people who are trying their hardest to be even-handed and fair.  (Edit: And we were.  I'm very self-critical.  Most people in my position would likely have seen no problems at all.)  We could have used a second level of review with fewer ties to anyone, but we didn't have that.  In regards to some of the things people here are talking about when they bring up bias, I do basically trust your process of handling reports themselves is as reliable as can be expected.  (You do have that second level I mentioned, where the mods have the option to report friends without also being the final word on their friend's fate.)  The question for me is the reports themselves (or the lack of them).  As others have pointed out, some of the rules are vague. When a mod sends in a report and it is upheld as ban-worthy, do you have any means of telling how often similar offenses go past without being flagged at all?  Similarly, when a mod is in a game and nothing is afterwards reported from that game, can you be certain nothing ban-worthy actually happened?  So far as I can tell, there is no way to be sure of either of these things, and that is where perceptions of bias can creep in.  ""My friend keeps getting banned for X, but I've seen 'mod's friend' get away with the same exact thing 20 times.""  Or, ""'Mod's friend' was acting like a complete jerk that whole game, and I pointed it out to 'mod', but nothing was done. (And no, I didn't report it officially myself, of course.  Too much work.  So I have no idea if any report was sent in or not.)""  That kind of thing.  I hope people will take you up on sending reports where they're concerned about fairness directly to General, so any instances where bias is actually happening can be documented.  Hopefully there's not much of it."

I ran into too many times where one of the ops did break the rules and the others said. ""Don't ban him!"" Like he broke one of the op rules. ""Do not op your friends."" Nothing I could have done.  We also have the same rule where we are not allowed to date other ops. (Happens often I guess.) And that rule got broken twice and still they wanted to keep the guys. (to be honest I fell for someone but kept my feelings in check... :/)  I guess that it happens on almost every server. No server is perfect.

I was in a Revenge of Cookie game before, A bunch of moderators were playing (mainly junior mods iirc, 2 who are now senior mods but were not at the time) and a certain individual called my friend an asshole after he raided their base and died.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,EctoCreations,6,Tue Jun 30 19:31:29 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that not all PMC mods are skype/ts mods.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,WintersLocke,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:51:35 2015 UTC,Very true.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,SSBBguys,2,Tue Jun 30 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the mods of the server being moderators of places like skype and team speak are relevant especially since neither is official in any way, but as the admin of the skype group I can tell you that the moderators of it was chosen because they are people I trust and I know would do a good job and it happened that a majority of them are moderators of the server. There are still non PMC mods that moderate the chat and that applies to me too."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Sanjisama,2,Tue Jun 30 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"All internet outlets connect and it would be foolish to ignore them, especially if PMC mods are using them to threaten or abuse players.  Would threatening to kill someone IRL in teamspeak be OK for a moderator on PMC to do if it wasn't allowed on the PMC server?  Not an actually occurrence that I am aware of btw, just trying to prove my point."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:54:41 2015 UTC,"Which teamspeak are you talking about? all the teamspeaks were made by community members and in no way represent PMC. the only semi-official one is t3hero's TS, and that's not even really moderated"

The only thing I can relate to what /u/Tomlough said about support responses being 'cold and distant'. The rest is all new to me and I have never experienced. Mods have only been kind and helpful.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,VintageDrummer1,4,Wed Jul 1 01:19:42 2015 UTC,"i agree, when one of my friends was banned, he was absolutely devastated about it. It really shows how much people care and support the server."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,donovanob7,2,Wed Jul 1 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"That's hardly fair, these people (the devs and lead team in particular) do devote a lot of time to the server and definitely care for it, there just are things that some people are (justifiably) unsatisfied about."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,ewokaro,-2,Wed Jul 1 04:11:11 2015 UTC,I think it's really interesting that the staff is seeing this large outcry but doesn't seem to be trying to fix anything
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,PMCperson,9,Wed Jul 1 11:47:29 2015 UTC,"What is there to fix?  I gave you guys the option of sending in a ticket in the general category of any evidence that supports this argument. Right now there is no tickets, that's giving me the message that there's no evidence and all these throwaways are trying to spread rumors."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Why?  Because people really waste time on that?  There's people who are not throwaways who say the same things.  Please.  They may be right, they may be wrong, they may be seeing things that aren't there out of their own prejudices.  But the attitude you are projecting here is one where you make it seem like you would not give a fair hearing to any ticket that came in anyway. Please dial it back some."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,3,Thu Jul 2 14:48:12 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to dial it back. These are serious claims that we take very seriously.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,t3hero,5,Fri Jul 3 05:56:30 2015 UTC,"Not trying to fix anything? If things are being put in place or discussed within the moderation team - not a part of it, so I wouldn't know -  it's probably not gonna be out in the open in a public Reddit thread just yet."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Bitjump,14,Wed Jul 1 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"I've had many issues with the mods. They constantly talk to you as if you're beneath them, and act like they own the server. They are here to moderate. Making friends and treating them like gods is not part of that job description."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,PMCTalker,6,Tue Jun 30 17:29:21 2015 UTC,So mods aren't allowed to have friends? Do you forget that mods started off as players?
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,0,Tue Jun 30 21:46:32 2015 UTC,im pretty sure 'mods shouldn't make or have friends' is not what he's saying. it seems that he's trying to say they 'treat their friends like gods'. from the way he wrote it
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,jonnyboyUSA,6,Wed Jul 1 12:28:21 2015 UTC,"Ikr, half the bans are for personal grudges and the rules are horribly unspecific.  They don't even tell you what you did wrong.  It also doesn't help that there are a select few people who spam report people for no reason other than to get people banned."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,9,Tue Jun 30 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"They don't even tell you what you did wrong.   I gotta admit I hate that. :(  All it means is when you appeal, you get a lecture on how horrible you are not to realize how horrible you were, on top of a lecture on how horrible you were.  It's not necessary.  I haven't felt that thoroughly humbled since I got caught copying off a friend in 7th grade.  It was hard.  But you take it, you have to if you still value the server.  And I do, and I think even most of those complaining about the mods probably do, or they wouldn't be here.  Whatever's going on that's invisible to me, the overall public face of the server is that of a place that's far less obnoxious to be part of than most servers and has a better community and fewer hackers (these days) to boot.  As a group, they're still doing something right."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,7,Tue Jun 30 19:51:38 2015 UTC,I only care because I want PMC to be exposed as the bad server it can be at times.  Only then will anyone try to fix it.  Maybe the mods don't even realize they appear this way to some people.  I have never been so glad that DvZ was moved to a different server.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,2,Tue Jun 30 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"DvZ was a long time ago, is it possible that anything you're saying is outdated? I remember when all the new mods were added there were actually a lot of complaints that they had so few powers, for instance.  They were expected to moderate UHC, say, but if it's 3 in the morning and no senior mods are around, they had no ability to ban. And people were unhappy with that.  It was explained that they needed to be evaluated first to make sure they could do the job accurately.  Are they actually doing better now? So many of the examples brought up have been from a year ago or more.  I'm cynical about systems, but I tend to like individual people, and I would certainly hope that specific examples of wrongdoing by mods would be addressed appropriately by the people who have the power to do that.  Players are held to strict standards and not forgiven lightly for mistakes; the mods should be the same."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,2,Tue Jun 30 20:51:28 2015 UTC,The problem was there then and it persists.  I still hear recent stories of people getting abused.  Roxie has mentioned one of them already.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,0,Tue Jun 30 21:35:24 2015 UTC,"DvZ was a long time ago, is it possible that anything you're saying is outdated?   Man, someone should tell this to the mods. There are a lot of people that were banned because of DvZ that stay banned to this day even though the entire reason they were banned in the first place is no longer relevant after DvZ moved to its own server (and yes, they did appeal afterwards and got declined)."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Splax77,11,Tue Jun 30 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"I've literally been spending the entire month of June going through old bans, currently 7200ish have been reviewed, and all the DVZ bans (not including most badfellowship and hacking bans) are unbanned. I'm not done yet, still have a few thousand to review."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,5,Tue Jun 30 21:48:23 2015 UTC,Just wondering... What sort of bans do not fall under hacking or badfellowship?
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,johnb43,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:50:25 2015 UTC,IIRC you could get banned for breaking a slab someone else placed so most likely it's these DVZ specific bans that get unbanned.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Sanjisama,4,Wed Jul 1 10:49:06 2015 UTC,"Breaking a slab... Depending where it is, it's badfellowship (griefing) or actually it helps the game (preventing slabfarming, unblocking halls,..)."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,johnb43,2,Wed Jul 1 11:32:54 2015 UTC,Umm cros.. Can I get an answer? I'm seriously interested  what sort of bans don't fall under those two reasons.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,johnb43,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:24:35 2015 UTC,think of bans specific to DVZ: eg. Torch breaking
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,4,Fri Jul 3 22:06:02 2015 UTC,Isn't that Bad fellowship?
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,johnb43,2,Sat Jul 4 11:43:56 2015 UTC,Aren't almost all of the bans from dvz bad fellowship bans?
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BringBackShields,2,Wed Jul 1 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"""Almost all""? Really? For bans of the more regular players that probably is the case, but there were still plenty of hackers with only a few games played."

I was banned and it was mostly fair so I'm not complaining about that, rather I feel like moderation treats the community like criminals waiting to happen.  With such a negative attitude towards some of the community, it's very hard to chill out or just have fun.  Chat can be confusing so I'm not going to use that as an example, but there are a TON of situations involving new players or people just trying to have fun that really shouldn't happen.  I've heard of people getting banned for breaking other people's slabs in DvZ back in the day, which really isn't a big deal, especially when it's walling someone out or preventing you from getting to monsters."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,4,Tue Jun 30 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"No problem is ever one sided. However, these mods dig and dig as if they want you banned. Then with others they let things slide. Favoritism is a major issue, and it needs to stop."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,PMCTalker,10,Tue Jun 30 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've had run-ins with mods who talk down to you frequently just because they've got a different coloured name. Think they forget that they're just mods of a Minecraft server, not President of Mojang. There's clear biases to their mates.   I used to /report and send video evidence to the mod team and I think I've only had a 20% success rate. Then I just gave up reporting players after the DvZ days when hackers hit an all-time high and moderators just seemed to stop doing their job.  I don't have any issue with a few of the mods... they seem to do their job alright, but there are others that treat it like they're untouchable or irreplaceable, and I think they need to be made aware that they aren't."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Abcmsaj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"Back when DvZ was still on the server there were very few mods, so reports were handled slower, now there are more mods and its more usefull to /report."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,randomaccountpmc,6,Tue Jun 30 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"More specific detail would be helpful probably, for the sight of people among the moderation team who might be willing to listen.  Chat log screenshots, for instance, even if the participants names are blacked out.  The bedrock box example is a good one, would be even better with a recording.  Etc.  I'm assuming the problems are real even if I can't comment on them directly, if only because there is no group of that many people that doesn't have its problem members.  There's always somebody.  So give the good ones the best possible chance to take actions, is all I can suggest.  It's what I'd expect to see if I were a mod myself, not that I'll ever be."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,BlueCyann,4,Tue Jun 30 18:19:23 2015 UTC,Don't agree with that. Only the most senior staff members are dealing with the support system. There will be always professional person responding to your ticket.
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,lukyCZ1,5,Tue Jun 30 18:15:46 2015 UTC,always. literally always. Ive had tickets where i was mean and i didnt realize until after i got a reply i was rude. They still made a professional reply.

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,7,Tue Jun 30 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"The rules can be unspecific though.  Last time I checked it (I need to look at it again to see if it has changed at all) swearing was OK, but I hear a lot about people receiving harsh punishments for 1 or 2 swear words which is harsh for a 1 strike system.  There are already examples of bans for links that were simply someone being helpful etc..  Moderation appears far less than friendly to a lot of people."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Rayalot72,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"I thought about this a lot.  People are scared of it because the server feels unforgiving.  You're perma-banning for swearing when you have mutes and other moderation tools at your disposal.  I guess my real complaint is that the moderation set up feels like it's out to get you, even if you're not really that bad of a person.  It's selective."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Tripleat,4,Tue Jun 30 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"not really, best is a mix of people no one knows and people everyone knows.  I've had a lot of times where some of the ""popular"" mods chime in with important information about some users.  And having mods with no friends on the server would be horrible.. you'd all be complaining that ""they're not friendly"". No one complained when we would spend hours upon hours playing various games with other players (be it dvz or msg or something else) in the past. A lot of us can't do that anymore because of work loads, but friendship doesn't affect decisions. There has been a number of cases where a mods friend did something stupid, and they went straight to me for it, or reported it to other mods.   Mods expect their friends to know better."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,3,Tue Jun 30 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"As mentioned earlier in some other posts, some moderators believe they're better than normal players.

Now about them being friends, well honestly wouldn't it better to get moderators with actual experiance instead of people who pardon me ""suck you off"" and act all friendly towards you just to be moderators?

I don't mind the mods, I haven't seen the issues that other people have seen, and yes I know at least 5 people that have gotten banned. and each one was warrented, even the 3 that got pardoned and one i do not agree with the pardon.   I always try to look at both sides. Can abuses happen, maybe, are they trying to make sure they don't happen, based on cros's post it appears to be that way.   in fact based on cros's post, some of the stories raised here are bullshit, like the smoozing to be mod, based on the last round of mod applications they didnt even know the names of the people they were hiring."

Being popular doesn't make you a good moderator.   This has been going on from the beginning!  First it was Guude, who put his friend Wes in charge rather than choosing someone impartial to run the server.  Wes chose his friends to moderate in the beginning, like t3, crowsat, and Azur, and then later friends of the people in power, or people who were really active on the server and had no life, got jobs.  What are Wes's credentials to run a server?  I don't know?  What about thekid?  He just plays a ton, he doesn't have any experience or knowledge  And labtech is just a friend of guude, and he's a mod because of nepotism, not because of any experience!

Wes choosing me, hero, and azur - Wes didn't even know our names before we applied to be mods, i've never spoken to him before and the only ties we had to him or anyone else was the Azur built a map for Rob in the past.  thekid - used to send in lots of ban tickets, been very helpful with moderation in the past.   labtec - he has sent in a lot of tickets, more than most people. He has also been very helpful in the past.    sigils and gyro - they made creepercart on another server, not regicide. creepercart is what Aureylian played. They joined PMC because we needed devs and they offered to help.  TL;DR yep we're all corrupt."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,definatelynotthrow,6,Tue Jun 30 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"Things like swearing is OK only if its not excessive. In addition to what you said to mods being people you can look up to, mods are people too. They have real lives. They are volunteers that want to help. PMC, in my opinion, is one of the safer communities that I have been in. The only reason why regular players would get banned is most likely because of bad fellowship, meaning that they have ruined the fun atmosphere of the game, and is probably why some of your friends are banned.   I don't understand how some of the PMC mods are ""biased."" They want to have safe environment for everyone. As I have said previously, mods probably have jobs and test that they have to do. Thus, they afk in a lobby. We can't expect all of the moderators to be quick about banning and supervising every game. If we did, then we would more moderators than we currently have.  If mods were biased, then the majority of us talking here would not be here. In addition, the mods would constantly debate over how the server should be run."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,SSBBguys,7,Tue Jun 30 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"FOR MOST OF THEM, NOT ALL. they're suppose to make it a safe environment, but due to the fact that if you tick off one of their friends(on purpose or accident) you will be threatened and they will do their best to make sure you are punished severely, including being banned forever. so making it a 'safe' environment isn't what they try to do or really want to happen."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,PMCperson,0,Tue Jun 30 17:47:43 2015 UTC,Why would you to tick them off in the first place? Just follow the PMC rules and it will be OK. It seems a bit silly to tick a mod off.

Perma-banning is a very harsh way to deal with slightly bad behavior, especially when you have tools to mute and any player can use /ignore (you're not even a big server, you're very small compared to other minigame servers).  I feel like some of the outcry is misguided, but that's no reason to set it aside.  There is SOMETHING wrong, and you should care enough to at least consider fixing it."

Griefing their own team over and over (Missile Wars)   Actually put those things in the ban message (and distinguish advertising a server from just posting a link in chat - those are very different things that result in the same ban message) instead of just lumping them all into ""bad fellowship"" which does nothing but result in a person being banned while they have no idea what they did wrong."

Hacked client -Permaban after at least 2 obvious cases of a hacked client.  Calling someone a racial/homophobic slur in chat -Mute permanently allowing an appeal after about a month.  Second case is a perma-mute that cannot be appealed.  Could be bannable and still be fair.  Constant harassment of another player- temp mute, and recommend to the harassed player to use /ignore.  A second time is a perma mute.  Could be bannable and still feel fair.  Spamming ""join my server _____!"" -permamute allowing an appeal at any time or a temp mute.  Doing it a second time can be a permamute that cannot get appealed.  Griefing their own team over and over (Missile Wars) -month ban, perma ban if they do it again (really depends on the game griefed, but this is my suggestion for something like missile wars).    In general chat offenses at least shouldn't be at a banning level in my opinion, they could easily be kept to mutes unless it leads to something more serious outside of PMC (RL threats through social media that is clearly tied to the MC account etc.).  I also see you didn't include the general use of language against another player.  Racial slurs and repeated harassment could be kept at banning level, but something as simple as ""FU"" shouldn't really be a perma-ban at the very least, which it currently is.  From my knowledge the use of warnings by staff is optional, and I think even not allowed for moderators.    Rereading I see what you're saying now, I took ""I urge anyone that has evidence of moderators acting outside their jurisdiction, please send through a ticket to croswat (using the General section on the support site)."" as a specific solution to my post, I apologize."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Sir_Phijkchu,-5,Tue Jun 30 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"Ok, I know some of you know about me accusing Kezza and Scin with their cross teaming and etc. But I have a strong feeling that Kezza has a part in ban/moderation. I know he's friends with mods but I am too so big whoop. But he takes it to a next level. He has a factor in banning people. I have been recently banned because of ""Bad Fellowship"" the only person I've been ""bad"" too was maybe Kezza when I'd accuse him. And that was months ago. Also a good friend of mine just got perm. banned for not ""leaving alone Kezza"" which is bullcrap. He never targets or be rude to him. He plays the game that's  it. A lot of other friends on the server that ironically kezza hates or gets annoyed at have gotten either perm. banned or temp banned. I just got temp banned... I need to be making sure I'm not the next targeted considering Kezza's hatred for me. This unfair biased modding staff is unbearable. Some of our best players have already given up on PMC because of this. With the original post, yes most of them are great at their job but some of them are biased and not fair to all of the players of PMC but instead giving an unfair advantage to some other people to be able to get away with things that other people could only dream of.  And I know there will be more enemies from this and who knows a perm ban for me.... But if we want to stop this we need to come out even stronger. And I know you're gonna reply with some cheapshit  response saying ""well, technically this and this blah blah blah"" but that solves NOTHING. Ain't gonna help.  SIR_PHIJKCHU"

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,VintageDrummer1,3,Wed Jul 1 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"For one, i can guarantee you Kezza has no part in the ""banning process"" for PMC. He is not a mod, therefore he doesnt have the powers to ban anyone. Granted he could theoretically tell a mod what that person did, give said mod evidence and that person would be banned. From what Staff like Croswat and t3hero say, any ban on PMC has to have SOLID evidence and is run by the mod team. Also ""targeting"" is something very much mis understood in my opinion. People go thier normal way in a game(Im assuming your talking about MSG) and find that person. That isnt targeting, rather just bad luck that those two players come across that. I know its different when their is a spec in the game telling you what is happening and where, but that is hard to tell  EDIT: All of this is mainly from Croswats long reply, sorry i didnt use exact quotes"
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,Ooarin,0,Wed Jul 1 05:40:55 2015 UTC,""" I need to be making sure I'm not the next targeted considering Kezza's hatred for me.""   This does not refer to in-game targeting but rather the focus of Kezza's alleged power to 'make things happen' on the server.  ""any ban on PMC has to have SOLID evidence and is run by the mod team""  From this I stem two points. One where solid evidence has been given and has not resulted in the punishment of players, and one where solid evidence has not been given and has resulted in the punishment of a player.   The first is the case of Kezza and Scin cross teaming in Team Blood Bath. Of this, there is video evidence and multiple eyewitness accounts. The accused have shared items, anvils and loot and have allowed the other to kill teammates, seemingly without resistance.   The second case be of the player Dwark. I feel this subject needs to be discussed as the player has been banned multiple times from accusations that held no merit, it shows the system is either very flawed or is being manipulated. This player was originally banned from the server under the presumption he was using a modification that allowed him to always hit his target in sword combat, similar to kill aura. Upon review and appeal, he was unbanned as there was no evidence of this. Dwark realised, ""If it can happen once, it can happen again."", and thus he began to be extremely careful and take several precautions, one of which was recording every game he had played on the server. Yet, he was banned again. Once again, he appealed, asking for the evidence. When given, it was seen how truly minuscule it was, in both size and in conclusiveness. In the clips given, there was less than a minute of Dwark fighting, clips in which he was not only missing hits, but was being ""combo'd"" himself. Dwark, of course, presented his perspective of these fights and waited for a reply. He had waited a month until it was concluded that there was, again, ""inconclusive evidence"". I bring this up not because I believe there is 'someone out to get' Dwark, but because the moderation is not ""100% certain"" when they ban."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,scintillateify,2,Wed Jul 1 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"Kezza does not have a say in who is banned on the server. He is friends with / talks to some of the mods. He cannot tell the mods how to do their job. Kezza talks to the newer mods, who... as cros mentioned do not have access to the bans / moderation tickets. They are sometimes included in the decision making process when the mods who deal with those tickets are unsure. To think Kezza has even an inch of power in that decision making process is honestly ridiculous and idiotic. And false.   Pmanning did constantly harass Kezza. Kezza asked him on a lot of occasions to stop talking to him , stop a dressing him and to stop private messaging him. There is evidence submitted against him. He got banned for it. Yet he still continued the harassment.... when Pmanning joined the pic public Skype chat that continued too.. Kezzza asked him 3 or so times to stop talking about him / addressing him. Yet he continued each time. Even after the Skype group moderators asked him not to as well :L He did not get banned for nothing. He got banned for continuing ruining the experience of the server for another person. He got banned for the harassment.  He got banned because there is a lot of evidence against him because he couldn't stop himself from annoying people.   I am not even going to a knowledge your cross teaming allegaton because clearly there isn't enough evidence to support that. Pmc rules say you have to uphold the spirit of the game by not purposely ruin the games for other people. Guess what... We don't do that. At all.     Now let's address some of your comments shall we?  ""I just got temp banned... I need to be making sure I'm not the next targeted considering Kezza's hatred for me."" - you... on my phone... cannot format properly.  Are you insinuating that Kezza got you banned? Because again... you are incorrect. I didn't either. I do not know why you are temp banned not who got you banned.     ""A lot of other friends on the server that ironically kezza hates or gets annoyed at have gotten either perm. banned or temp banned.""  ""Gets annoyed at"" as in they are giving him reasons to be annoyed right? As in they have said something to Kezza that has annoyed him. As in its their words which have caused annoyance? Case rested. If people are saying stuff to Kezza which could get them banned because they are annoying him. That is EVIDENCE. and they've probably done it to others too. Of course you don't actually know who got your friends banned though do you? You are just guessing and uunairly placing the blame on one person based on Pmanning's ban.    Everything you have said in your comment is either incorrect or invalid. It's just one big post targeting Kezza.  Makes sense that does. Well done."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,PMCperson,-2,Wed Jul 1 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Really? That's what you're considering cross teaming?i went for the people who were in clean sight of me everytime. Then as usual we always like a fair fight if we're the last 2. But that's only if we're the last 2. That in no way shows any cross teaming what so ever. It shows me attacking whichever player I see first as well as Scin doing the same. When it came down to us 2 being the final 2 we took our time to have the final fight and both got geared up. What's wrong with that? If that's how we both wanted our final fight then that's how we wanted it. No one else was a part of it. It didn't effect anyone else. That video really is pointless and the ""see this"" just shows that we want a fair final fight and we dislike cleaning eachother up."
playmindcrack,3bnb2m,definatelynotthrow,4,Wed Jul 1 04:45:50 2015 UTC,"Whether it's the beginning or the end, its still cross-teaming. There's been many times when it's come down to me and a friend, but we don't chill and gear up, we fight because 1: that's the fair thing to do 2: it's against the rules 3: it's not really necessary to do  Edit: not to mention that fact that scin didn't even try to help her team fight you, she just stood back and let you kill them. Which is bad fellowship and it doesn't uphold the spirit of the game."

playmindcrack,3bnb2m,croswat,16,Wed Jul 1 05:51:36 2015 UTC,"I find it REALLY hard to believe that if a mod was treating people this way, that they would have a job anymore. no company in the world would keep a security guard that is stealing and that is what this post is implying.   In an ideal world, that is how it would be. But all of the mods are part of a big circle of friends, and anyone inside that circle of friends is untouchable. When they recruited a bunch of junior mods a few months back, anyone who knew some of the mods could easily see they were recruiting people who were friends with the existing mods rather than people who have experience moderating (although I've had doubts since day one that any of the moderators have experience moderating servers, especially one of the scale PMC strives to be as the official server of the mindcrack brand). When there is corruption all the way up the chain of command, corruption lower down is ignored or even encouraged while still maintaining the illusion of a good mod team for the players willing to be deceived.  To be honest I'm surprised it's taken so long for people to realize and post about this, these issues have been around almost since day 1 of the server. The moderation has always been corrupt and it's especially easy to see when you or someone you know gets on the bad side of one of the mods. Someone who has been a good friend of mine for a long time (I am not going to name them in this post, but if they see this they will know who they are) has been consistently harassed by PMC mods on a teamspeak he frequents and was even banned from there at one point because of them. He was later pardoned but still put under restrictions easily abusable by mods such as not being allowed to be in the same channel as a PMC mod without their consent. In a recent incident a PMC mod went into the channel he was in and when asked if they were okay with him being there they continually avoided the question; a few minutes later he was pulled down into a locked channel by one of the mods of the teamspeak who is also a PMC mod. While I don't know the details of what was said in there, he sounded very sad when he came out and it was probably nothing good. In fact, that's not even an isolated incident; the moderation of that teamspeak isn't very good either, but that is its own story and not relevant here.  Another easy example is the phrase ""bad fellowship"". While it sounds simple enough on paper, in practice it has turned into an easy way for mods to describe any behavior they don't like and at times even contradicts itself with how it has been used. Bad fellowship is an intentionally vague term left open to interpretation by the mods and often is used to ban anyone they have a personal grudge against. The idea of a one strike server to begin with is nonsensical and one of the many reasons I question whether the mods have any experience moderating other minecraft servers, but bad fellowship is an easy example of where this system fails; 99% of the time, when someone I know is banned for bad fellowship (which has happened several times before), they don't even know what they did wrong. What is the point of punishing someone, much less banning them, if they don't even know what they did wrong?  Also many of the mods are very immature, someone I know frequents a teamspeak owned by the PMC mods (different from the one mentioned before), and the description of one of the channels is literally ""butts"" 20 times over. This is an easy example of how they act in private, and really show the true colors of the people who moderate the server.  There are many other issues I could point out, such as someone who got banned for raiding a mod's base in Revenge of Cookie, and people being falsely banned for hacking (hell, when you make a ban appeal, you aren't even allowed to see the evidence that was used against you, you just have to believe them that it exists. I don't know about anyone else but this makes me wonder whether they need evidence to ban at all), but I think I've gotten my point across already and I'm not always the best at putting issues that I know exist into words. I wouldn't be surprised if this post gets deleted anyway.  Also, while I appreciate your attempt at making an analogy, moderating a minecraft server is much different from being a security guard. I don't know any of the mods personally so I can't speak for how good a specific mod is, but I think it is in the best interest of PMC to just completely purge the mod team from the top down and start over with a completely new one if they ever want to be successful in the Minecraft server market. PMC's active player base (and confidence in their mod team too honestly) is at an all time low right now. The moderation of this server is a complete joke, just like Chris Christie's attempt to run for president.  Edit: removed the bit about games not updating because of wwarcher being a junior dev after clarification by Bitjump, I did not have the full story on that."

Bad fellowship is an intentionally vague term left open to interpretation by the mods and often is used to ban anyone they have a personal grudge against.

I don't know about anyone else but this makes me wonder whether they need evidence to ban at all   Witch hunts. that's why we don't share evidence, Every time we share evidence it comes back to us through another way, and we find out they've shared it with everyone they know, and suddenly the person that gave us the evidence is being harassed.

And that brings up another issue: ban evasion. PMC mods have always said that you will get banned if you try to ban evade, yet 99% of the time they simply ignore known cases of ban evasion. The exception to this is people they have a grudge against, an example known to me being Oldmantoby. I'm not going to talk about the original reason why he was banned (he has a long history with the mods), but he has been banned on multiple alt accounts for ban evasion while people like matthewtalbot are allowed to run free because they're friends with the mods. I've also seen many people who aren't friends with the mods use alt account to ban evade, but it's especially pathetic when the mods know someone is evading a ban and doesn't ban them simply because they like the person. The mods really shouldn't be operating on a double standard, and yet it's painfully obvious to anyone who pays attention."

He played on PMC while in Skype calls with mods ban evading the entire time. Nothing was ever done about it. The point of that post was not so much about the specific people mentioned in it (they are far from the only examples of the issues I mentioned), but rather the hypocritical double-standard the PMC mods have been known to show when dealing with their friends vs people they dislike for whatever reason.

An unsubstantiated, vague claim, but an intriguing, one, yes? One you'd want to pursue, to find his meaning? However, instead of directly asking him what he means by it, and what proof he can provide, your post is ""Aren't you a banned player?"" That post, by itself, does not make your intent (discerning the truth behind Ray's statement) clear, and can really only be construed as a barbed comment until/unless you clarify it further.  I jumped on you for that because not only is that an immensely lazy form of arguing that makes your stance look all the weaker, it's simply misleading and can be outright insulting. Whatever your intent may have been from your post is honestly irrelevant, given how easy it is for the average reader to completely miss the message you wanted them to take away from it.  I was harsh on you, yes, but understand that my harshness stems not from hostility, but from frustration that this sort of argument is at all acceptable here, in an open discussion about moderator policy.

Also since it's nerf I think skald is amazing and I dissagree that it's broken in any way. You're slower than a barb and in return you can take 1-2 extra hits from the hight damage dealing classes and you need to use potions if you want to keep up the speed instead of barbs consistent speed."

Assassin is being fixed with the update, and I'll probably play it a lot more since it kills a lot of classes in very few hits.   Reaver has been my favourite class for a long time after I stopped using skald, because it can take plenty of hits, but you always have the ability to heal yourself up, re-rage an go back to killing things. However base berserker is enough to kill it in an even battle because of the extra health.  I also really enjoy using armsman from time to time, since if you catch a scout off guard, you can 2 shot them before they have a chance to get away. That and most players don't expect a knight class to deal so much damage."

playmindcrack,3bbyle,Bitjump,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"Please explain ""when switching to the opposing team"" in the Blackbeard context. There's no team-selection option in Blackbeard. You play on the team to which you're assigned, unless I'm missing a very valuable game mech. (?)  Nvmd, I just now, first-ever, experienced joining mid-game. That's never worked for me, ever, I always just get shunted back to /lobby. I guess I can understand, now, how it might be possible to re-join a game and pick a different team.  Maybe. I'll need to be able to repeat the experience to confirm."

playmindcrack,3bbyle,Bitjump,2,Mon Jun 29 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"This is a separate question, but is it intended in Blackbeard for you to be able to rejoin your original team if your game crashes or for some other reason you leave?  (Is your spot held for you?)  I ask because the other day I left a game deliberately after being killed three times by a player who was invisible to me.  I'd been in the game from the start.  When I logged in again, I had to go back to the portal manually, choose the game manually -- and although I did wind up back on the same team, it seems my slot was not actually held. I didn't get any gold for that game -- same as currently happens if you join mid-game and lose."

Ranged classes aren't that effective in the keep due to the enemies being so close, they work much better on the castle walls and by the roads where they can capitalize on their long range.   Scout is a support class, not an offensive class. It has a bow and speed for a reason.    I don't consider scout a support class in this current meta due to how it is played, scouts run around in the keep and deal damage, just like the berserker classes. If scouts were played as I said earlier I would consider them more of a support class.  The bow is obviously the main weapon of a scout, but the dagger has its uses. It's a much safer bet than the bow for finishing off a target if they are at low health and in close range"

I completely agree with you on everything that you said. For one i dont want to play Blackbeard anymore because the kill boards ruin it for me and ruins the point of the game. It would be best to completely remove the kill leaderboard. It causes to much rage within people, and i can see people getting mad over this and saying things they shouldnt and them getting banned.  I like your idea of how we could put a leaderboard about upgrading, but i still see a problem there. I think this would still cause a lot of fighting/spawn camping. Not as much as right now, but it would still be some.  As for spawn camping I think that it would interesting to see if the devs could make something similar to an invisible screen. Say youre on the redcoats and a pirate is chasing you. Maybe after you get to a certain point close to the spawn the pirate gets stuck at a border he cant go inside. This is just an idea, so thoughts on this would be nice. Also, i love how the first thing that you say is to not downvote it because it conflicts your opinion. People on this subreddit simply vote you down because they dont agree with you, and thats just wrong."
playmindcrack,3b40ox,VintageDrummer1,3,Thu Jun 25 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Really, it might hard at the moment with the Tribes Update for developers to pump out or implement special ideas such as the screen you've stated or some sort of ""spawn region"". And thank you for your opinion about the upgrades leaderboard, I'm seeing some of the problems with that. The only hope that I have is that they simply just remove the kills leader board in particular and we might see some changes. I'll just have to sit tight."
playmindcrack,3b40ox,VintageDrummer1,2,Thu Jun 25 20:27:12 2015 UTC,"yea, i know Tribes has been a big push for them, and their is still more stuff coming out so i dont imagine anything bug like a ""spawn region"" will come out soon. Maybe in the future, maybe not. And even if they take out the kills board and just have 2 leaderboards, im completely fine with that too."
playmindcrack,3b40ox,BlueCyann,2,Thu Jun 25 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of protected spawns elsewhere and they work great for that purpose, but I think players should probably still be susceptible to being killed right up until they've stored the item in question.  (Spawncamping can still happen just outside a protected area, too; it's just a little less convenient.)"
playmindcrack,3b40ox,PikadudeNo1,2,Thu Jun 25 20:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't see any better changes than* trying to revert the kills leaderboard, because atleast that way, no one wins.

playmindcrack,3b40ox,BlueCyann,2,Fri Jun 26 06:00:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with the gist of your post, though I have to say I've seen very little (effective) spawn-camping lately.  Maybe one game in 10; I can live with that.  (Another one in ten, one team tries to camp, fails, and gets kill-farmed and then steamrolled in about 5 minutes flat.  I'm OK with that too.  Should be penalties for your team overestimating their capabilities.)  Early on it was very prevalent, though, and I don't want to go back to that.  The kill leaderboard was one of only two changes I'm nervous about (the other being the new upgrade system enhancing team snowballing -- but something had to be done there about how it was and this is a very reasonable start to finding that sweet spot. I don't see the upside of the kills thing.)  All that said I'm not exactly against it, at least not yet, not having seen how it affects the game in practice.  (Not sure why anyone would refuse to play outright just on the principle.)  Can we have it on a trial basis?  If mods and trusted longtime players can confirm it's having a bad effect, we can get rid of it?"
playmindcrack,3b40ox,Voltage2016,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"Now while players might not experience Blackbeard that same way I have, atleast admit that the idea of having a kills leaderboard may have been the wrong choice.   Honestly BlueCyann, I see this perspective as well and I can see why the kills leaderboard may not be a problem. But from experience, players that go for kills are not ones that positively reflect the community. And yes, while there are always consequences to a team that attempts to spawncamp, I feel like certain characters in this small community need to be told that kills are not everything in Blackbeard. In addition, if I could record some of my games, I think that 1 in 10 game where the opposing team can successfully spawncamp are games that are the games that are the most infuriating."
playmindcrack,3b40ox,cvanaelst,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"(I think you quoted the wrong thing.)  I don't disagree with any of that.  It's just that it was done, so hey -- maybe I'm wrong and it would not be doom.  I'm going to play anyway, so I'll hope for the best and if it really does create a bigger problem, hopefully it will be removed.  The thing I like best about Blackbeard are those rare moments of teamwork that you can create even with limited communication.  You and a teammate are in the cave at the same time.  The teammate picks up the gold.  On the way out, an opposing player or two shows up.  You sacrifice yourself to attack so your teammate can get the gold home.  The other team gets the kill, but your team gets the score.  Or you run into the temple just as the gold spawns, grab it, and are attacked on the way out, blind and helpless. Your teammate who also knows the spawn time is already there and bails you out.  That kind of thing.  (OK the blindness won't be an issue anymore, but maybe you're still down a couple of hearts from the Guardian.  Or maybe you're just not very good at PVP!)  But none of that has anything to do with kills.  Don't get me wrong, I do like killing people in the game, and I will choose to go try to get my murder on if we're way up, way down, everybody else is going for the gold already or I'm just in the mood.  But it's not the point."

playmindcrack,3b31ei,t3hero,4,Fri Jun 26 02:08:23 2015 UTC,Our moderators are already volunteers?
playmindcrack,3b31ei,SSBBguys,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:14:08 2015 UTC,Like other volunteers that want to moderate the server.
playmindcrack,3b31ei,t3hero,2,Fri Jun 26 13:24:38 2015 UTC,So just more moderators.
playmindcrack,3b31ei,SSBBguys,3,Sat Jun 27 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Yes. Moderators for PMC, and moderators for the vanilla server."
playmindcrack,3b31ei,VintageDrummer1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"That's why I thought patron only would be better. Or have a vanilla world but with plot stones that you can buy with gold/silver that grant protection, but players can place them wherever they want. I used to play on a server that used Pstones, although I'm not sure that plugin is still around."

playmindcrack,3b31ei,SSBBguys,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"because non patrons are like ""no thats stupid, i cant afford patron"" so they downvote it so it doesnt happen. its weird"
playmindcrack,3b1kc0,t3hero,4,Thu Jun 25 05:46:39 2015 UTC,Were the initial spawn buffs meant to be removed? They were such an effective anti-spawn camping mechanic especially now the leaderboards are rewarding players for spawn camping.

playmindcrack,3b1kc0,croswat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"The change log is just supposed to give an overview of the changes. News go into the context regarding the changes and inform the community about what is happening with the server. News is way more important than change logs, but it can be nice to have to easily see what has changed. Let's say I want to know how Skald was changed, In a change log I would search for Camelot and there I see:   Skald: Sprint potions were changed from Speed 3 (60%) to Speed 1 (20%)    It would take a lot longer time to go through all news posts in order to find that same information.  This news post wouldn't be as informative in the change log, just something short like this:    Mounts have been released. The 15 different mounts available are: Guardian, Squid, Tribe Sheep, Wolf, Wolfie, Ocelot, Mooshroom, Chicken, Chicklet, Cow, Cowlet, Pig, Piglet, White Sheep, and Rainbow Sheep"
playmindcrack,3b24sa,mythbustman,3,Thu Jun 25 10:30:59 2015 UTC,"-For the first build I would recommend for content, while the idea is cool, all it seems to be is stairs. Maybe adding stuff inside the temple and adding more detail the outside may help. -For the second build I would recommend you try making the terrain not super flat especially when most the the detail is on the nature aspect. Also the vanilla tree is basic, so you can add more logs or leaves to change the shape of the tree to something interesting. Lastly the house is just one color. Maybe try adding logs for support and adding a different color roof. ~Hopefully this helps inspire you as well as helps the schematics get accepted in the future!"

Not to sound like I'm completely degrading your ability to build cause I really dont seem to come off that way, I think you should dive deeper in the pool of detailing, design and structure.   Myth, you've got potential to improve significantly! But, you've got to practice, I suggest trying to get ranked up on creative plot servers where they have professional (paid) builders there to help people improve that want to improve. I'm sorry your builds got rejected, you've got a great concept! You really do but, the execution was sadly not on par with the concept of design.  I hope this helps Myth, have a good day :)"

playmindcrack,3aym4k,dolfly_,3,Wed Jun 24 15:54:39 2015 UTC,Yes there is. Its the slightest change to the default. The only thing that i could notice is that absorption hearts are gray instead of yellow

playmindcrack,3aym4k,WintersLocke,2,Wed Jun 24 19:35:43 2015 UTC,Its actually quite a large default texture pack from 1.7 that attempts to override your own texture pack with a vanilla one. I personally use it as a template for all the other packs I work on.
playmindcrack,3aym4k,t3hero,2,Wed Jun 24 21:44:22 2015 UTC,Is it attempting to overide your pack so that you dont use one during games?
playmindcrack,3aym4k,VintageDrummer1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Why is it large if it's just overriding the default resourcepack from 1.7, and wouldn't that just be the same as using the default 1.7 resource pack to template everything else?

playmindcrack,3ans5e,jonnyboyUSA,5,Mon Jun 22 01:35:18 2015 UTC,So.... expensive....
playmindcrack,3ans5e,njb508,3,Mon Jun 22 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"Oy the prices.  These are really not options for anyone who doesn't play 24/7 and is not also a patron.  (or who is willing to spend cash, there's always that)  A bit disappointing.  I'm a patron, but my total haul in silver in the last several months is only about 3000.  If I want to do anything else with silver on the server, these are all out of my league.  (I do get a squid, so that's nice.)"
playmindcrack,3ans5e,BlueCyann,4,Mon Jun 22 12:59:23 2015 UTC,"Its better than most other networks if you think about it, you have the ability to play on PlayMindcrack, earn in-game currency so that you may spend that currency on fancy lobby stuff or in-game items! Others server require you to pay upwards of $30 for a horse mount in their lobbies and even more for others. The prices and the system are set up for dedicated players that have a reward/goal to get to while playing games on PlayMindcrack so you don't have to spend loads of money to get the specific items or mounts that you want, essentially, it's not pay-to-win and personally... that makes truly special amongst all the other servers."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,WintersLocke,6,Mon Jun 22 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's bad. :)  Just disappointing, from the perspective of someone who simply can't play more than casually, however loyal or not, for there to be virtually nothing of any permanence available for purchase to me through in-gamesilver alone.  As it is, since I've been saving up for Pegasus boots for like 5 months now and am still nowhere close, I've spent silver on almost nothing, not even fireworks.  (The only thing I've caved on was the rent on a small plot.)  So you're not getting much in the way of ""hey newbie, look at the cool stuff this player has"" from me,  nor are you tempting me to break down and purchase silver outright for lack of progress in saving, since fireworks aren't worth it to me and I can't afford the big stuff without giving up entirely on ever getting the boots. Maybe more stuff in the 100s of silver range might break the pattern?  I dunno, just some thoughts."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,BlueCyann,3,Mon Jun 22 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"I agree; a lot of what puts me off about the server is the prices of things. It took me way too long to earn 500 gold, maybe I'm playing the wrong games or something, and that only bought like one upgrade for one class. But I'm glad that the in-game currency requires skill or persistence to earn. Still though, I think we should have the ability to purchase vanity items at a lower rate with Gold than with Silver."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,Zazie_Lavender,9,Mon Jun 22 15:25:29 2015 UTC,Welcome to a EULA compliant server. This is what this has to look like now for us to try to keep the doors open.
playmindcrack,3ans5e,Sigils,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there really should be a better model available; I like it not being ""Pay to win"" but this naturally inflates vanity items because of server costs. I do second the idea of being able to have more items in the lower price ranges though...but I can't say what that should be, I trust you will be creative enough to figure this out."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,Zazie_Lavender,2,Mon Jun 22 21:48:42 2015 UTC,"we're working on more cheaper cosmetics (think fireworks, foods, and items)"
playmindcrack,3ans5e,croswat,3,Tue Jun 23 00:34:26 2015 UTC,"Can I offer a suggestion? The consumables never feel worthwhile to me, I'd love it though if we had the ability to buy something that was fairly cheap but had a big cooldown, but was also stackable. Stacking the item progressively reduces the max cooldown so that it can be used more frequently but it never actually reduces in quantity when used. I could see this starting at a 1 day cooldown reduced to 10s at a full 64 stack (or something of that nature) and costing roughly 20-100s per instance, depending on the item. If reduced cooldown doesn't make sense, the effect of the item could be enhanced instead (or, possibly both the effect and cooldown).  It gives you something to work towards that has an immediate payoff each time you purchase it (would help if purchasing a new instance reset the cooldown too) but still adds up to a lot of silver over time and doesn't feel like throwing away money like consumables do."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,Feldoth,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"I like this idea quite a bit; it would make for something cool to have; and it lowers the barrier to entry without strongly diminishing the value. I imagine it'd be like this: The cooldown is 1 minute. For each item in the stack; the cooldown reduces by 1 second. until you have at least 60; the last 4 in any stack could potentially allow for expansion on the cosmetic; for example you could make it progressively better at 8, 16, 32 and 64! (This would make up the extra 4 to a stack of 64 and thus allow for 4 upgrade tiers)  For example a full stack could allow it to be spammed up to 5-10 times per second (depending on how this loads the server)"
playmindcrack,3ans5e,Zazie_Lavender,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:05:21 2015 UTC,"Try playing Camelot? I know it may not be the game for everyone, nor is there a game running 24/7 but it does give the most Gold/Silver from my understanding along with a soonTM update."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,WintersLocke,5,Mon Jun 22 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"I have some issues with Camelot as it is now.  (First, again, the need for currency to get anything other than basic classes.  That's not a deal breaker for me, though.  Not at the frequency I would play it, anyway.)  My main issue is the win condition/secondary is the long and featureless walk back from respawn.  If those two things were addressed I'd play it more.  I do have the issue that games are rarely going when I'm on."
playmindcrack,3ans5e,BlueCyann,2,Mon Jun 22 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"KGM pays pretty well too although it isn't for everyone. My primary issue having played it for so long is that converting all the gold to silver to buy stuff is too grindy and I give up. I could buy the 20K mount now but I could barely sit through the effort to convert enough to buy Pegasus boots, much less that.

Also, for every Sean the sheep transaction, i think Sean shouldnt close every time you use him. This proves very annoying when trying to convert a lot of silver."

playmindcrack,3al97q,laurenisabellax,6,Sun Jun 21 10:24:27 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't. It simply refreshes the DNS cache. Basically, imagine you had a notepad with names of people then their phone numbers. Flushing your DNS cache is equivalent to erasing the numbers you have written down and the next time you call them, you simply look it up in the most up-to-date telephone book instead of using your notepad of numbers. It's a little more complex than that, but that's the general gist of it. It won't delete any stored server addresses, it'll just re-lookup the IP (a bit like the phone number) for the domain name (the name you connect with)."

I've traced this issue to MC 1.8.7 which seems to have issues with res packs that have an _ in the name. The PMC res packs are called ""legacy_something"" so all have the same name prefix. The MC client saves them under the name ""legacy"" with everything after the _ deleted so they just keep overwriting each other. Downgrading to 1.8.6 fixes the issue. I assume that changing the naming convention of the res packs would fix this for PMC and I also assume there is a bug in the MC client related to this too although I did not make any real attempt to verify that yet. Hopefully this helps others..."

Anyway. Hi, I'm that other dude in the game.  What happened here is something that happens once in a while; on that particular day it happened a couple times in a row. A normal server spawned with 10 people. But after a couple of minutes, the server erroneously spawned 10 more people in our server, even though the game wasn't done yet. They should obviously have gone to a different server, but for some reason that didn't happen.  Anyway, these people as this inevitably happens started spawning missiles in the lobby area. You see, everybody in the game - even people that are not in a team - gets the same stuff. So if the red and green team get a juggernaught, they get a juggernaught. And that can just be placed in the lobby. Spawn a couple in roughly the same spot and the whole lobby goes sky-high. This is a problem because of how missile spawning works:   When spawning a missile, you're actually just spawning a mob This mob is killed by the game logic, and its position is recorded   then the game logic copies a missile using /clone from a secret compartment in the lobby area to the location of the spawned mob    When these missile models are blown up, by those spectators, the missiles don't work anymore. There is nothing to copy over anymore. So this leads to either drawn-out games, unfinishable games or people forfeiting.  There are a couple solutions to this problem: Either make absolutely sure that spectators cannot spawn missiles, or move the missile models to another location where they can't be blown up, or make absolutely sure that people cannot get erroneously put into games that are in progress already. I'd say that moving the missile models over is the easiest way to go. Another possible option is to just put a big bedrock box around the missile models."

playmindcrack,39uiap,FalingDutchman,7,Sun Jun 14 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"We don't have an ETA on a fix just yet. The problem is with our datacenter - they're having issues with AC-units failing. The high temperatures caused the servers to shutdown, as well as overheating the PDU of the hall where the affected servers were located.  We've put in a work order to have the affected servers moved to an area with functioning AC, but that is likely to take a while. When that is done, we're probably not going to be able to just boot everything up and be back online, as the PDU overheating means that our servers lost power instantaneously, creating data integrity issues in our databases. This needs to be resolved manually.  Keep an eye on our twitter for updates - we'll post info there as soon as we have it!"
playmindcrack,39uiap,olmok,3,Sun Jun 14 22:28:40 2015 UTC,is there any data loss on this that youre aware of?
playmindcrack,39uiap,VintageDrummer1,4,Sun Jun 14 22:41:33 2015 UTC,"We can't really tell yet - once the issue is reported as resolved by the DC, we can bring our databases up again and start checking their integrity - this might take some time, due to the large number of records we have. Not until this is finished can we, with any confidence, say if there has been any loss or not."

playmindcrack,39o955,TLUL,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:58:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a leaderboard that's ""games won - games lost"" (ie a plus/minus) rather than most games won. That way someone who's won 150 out of 200 games ranks higher than someone who's won 200 out of a thousand."
playmindcrack,39o955,BlueCyann,3,Sun Jun 14 06:23:29 2015 UTC,So the person who plays and wins 1/1 or 2/2 games would rank higher than someone who wins 50/100?
playmindcrack,39o955,TLUL,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:55:14 2015 UTC,It could require playing a minimum number of games to get on the leaderboard at all.
playmindcrack,39o955,VintageDrummer1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:05:21 2015 UTC,"Actually the way it was put, they wouldn't: 1 win in 1 attempt would be a ranking of ""1"" (1-0), while 150 out of 200 would be a ranking of ""100"" (150-50)."
playmindcrack,39o955,oOBLAZEBURNOo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"The way I put it the first time, 50/100 would rank 0, below 1/1, which would rank 1. There's room to improve the precise definition, but I think just requiring a minimum of say 25 games would balance it nicely. There's also the possibility of ""over last 200 games"", as well as monthly rankings.  What we really need is to put in a thorough statistics logger so we have data to build interesting leaderboards later. Also, analytics help figure out what needs rebalancing, yada yada (I may be biased by my computer science background here)."
playmindcrack,39o955,Sigils,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The number has to be higher. Example; I've won 20 games, but lost 19. TLUL has won 10 games, but only lost 1. He would be higher as 20 - 19 = 1, but 10 - 1 = 9."

playmindcrack,3966fy,Bitjump,2,Tue Jun 9 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Probably unrelated but is it normal to have to download the resource pack(s) every time you load into an area? Is there no caching? This seems bandwidth intensive for the server and it is adding significant load times to transitions (~10-20sec, with 150gb/down connection). I don't really play online anywhere else so I'm not sure if this is expected behavior (it's really annoying)."

I haven't played with the server resource pack in a while, but from what I recall the resource pack should only download once, and it would then load instantly the next time you join a lobby.

playmindcrack,3966fy,uxhy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:21:52 2015 UTC,"sorry for the late reply, but this is also a 1.8.7 issue, in previous versions it checks the resource pack when you join the game, and if it's the same it doesn't do any downloading.  in 1.8.7, it just downloads it every time anyway."

We haven't told the general public yet, but Falnor hasn't been with us for a few weeks. A few weeks ago, in a lava fuelled drunken rage, he tried to melt Petey down into ""vendor ingots"" (whatever that is), and our hands were forced. He was a liability, and a threat to the security of both our other vendors as well as our players, so we had him hospitalised. Petey is still suffering from PTSD, and our medical staff is unsure if he'll ever be the same again. In order to not scare our younger players, we played this on the down low, and had a couple of our new vendors dress up as Falnor and Petey, which seems to have worked as it has gone unnoticed until now."

We have developers, builders and moderators, that all have distinct responsibilities:   Developers, answering to Sigils, write the code for our custom plugins and create the games Builders, answering to t3hero, create the beautiful worlds that we see on the server Moderators, answering to Croswat, uphold the law and make sure Kevin and Jimmy follow the rules.   On top of that, we have actually have a fourth team made up of the team-leaders and myself. This team sets policy, decides on short- and long-term goals and such together with the Mindcrackers.  There's no real overlap between the teams, but it happens from time to time that a team gets involved in areas outside their core mission (like moderators helping the build team when more hands on deck is needed). Some things fall outside the immediate responsibilities of the teams themselves, this is usually handled by a team-leader or a 3rd party contractor.  I hope this clears things up a little :)"

For experienced players it's not very difficult to stop in the middle and jump onto another missile (if you could spawn the missiles in the direction you are facing), but it's not enough.

playmindcrack,3778i6,PhD_Phil,1 point,Mon May 25 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, except that i think it would be farily complex and the team across each other would try to take the other out and not really try for the team on their left or right.

If you had done something along the lines of requesting Vintagebeef to do his building contest in mindcrack island, not only would he get content touring the island for houses, but also a huge influx of patron and silver sales. Those who couldn't afford that would be flooding the minigames with players making the general experience of playmindcrack much better."
playmindcrack,3715op,AbdealiGames,20,Sun May 24 02:58:53 2015 UTC,I think one reason why Mindcrack Island didn't attract players was because of the high prices of silver. You'd have to play like 24/7 without a patron allowance or something like that. Silver is really hard to get and that's one of the reasons why I didn't play at least.
playmindcrack,3715op,Antomic99,8,Sat May 23 23:02:39 2015 UTC,"Or conversely, the high silver prices of plots.

playmindcrack,36jmha,BroskiBen,3,Tue May 19 21:35:25 2015 UTC,The major problem with doing something like this would be cost.  Quite a small number of players per server = we need a lot of servers potentially to keep players able to get into games.
playmindcrack,36jmha,Sigils,1 point,Wed May 20 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I thought, I changed it from 2 players to 4 but it probably would still need to be raised higher to be cost efficient :/"
playmindcrack,36jmha,SSBBguys,2,Wed May 20 17:47:58 2015 UTC,I think this would be an interesting concept that the devs could do.
playmindcrack,36jmha,Gunner857,1 point,Tue May 19 22:19:15 2015 UTC,The game would not take much just the server startup and points/score system. But I do agree much fun with new 1.8 stuff.

playmindcrack,36jcp4,BouncyWith7s,12,Tue May 19 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"Only if you promise to feed it, clean it and pick up after it."
playmindcrack,36jcp4,MrShourin,2,Tue May 19 22:52:33 2015 UTC,this can be prevented by changing the world save to not allow structures to spawn. This is normally done at the start of making a new world. I am not sure if this can be done in preexisting worlds.
playmindcrack,36dxzd,cvanaelst,5,Mon May 18 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"for me, the charm of RoC is the semi persistent world. as cvan mentioned in his post it's nice to be able to hop in regardless of how  many are online.  the forced 1.8 mining fatigue doesn't bother me as much as some old timers, simply because i played my first round on 1.8 not knowing any better. however having a few spins on 1.7 spoiled me.  sure the game definitely needs an update, anvils are borked since the 1.8 change, and as much as i say the fatigue doesn't bother me, i have other things to do in a day aside from waiting 18 seconds to break another block.  enjoy the people, enjoy the slightly relaxed game mode of cave terror and pvp. love the persistent world.   please don't destroy it in changing it. ./wave"
playmindcrack,36dxzd,sindalee,6,Mon May 18 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of sad to see RoC dissapear. I didn't play from the start, but I discovered Cookie about half a year ago. I was basically being obsessed by it for 2-3 months. I remember my first game of Cookie, running to 0,0 almost every time I logged off, trying to get points (and failing miserably). I remember the last game I properly played, giving me about more than 200,000 points. I remember the days I spent fishing, while watching Mindcrack videos, trying to get on the leaderboards. Personally I never played it for the combat, I considered Cookie more as an ABBA rules caving game. And it gave me much satisfaction. Not going to lie, sometimes it gave me also some frustration. I wasn't able to figure out how people could stripmine with the mining fatigue (I never played on 1.7). And also seeing hidden chests looted by (cheaty?) people got to me more than once. I hope they had their fun in the last games I played, only finding a piece of paper in those chest saying ""How did you find me?""     Anyway i'll probably have some fun in Cookie while it's still on the server. Maybe trying to get in the top10 (although I doubt it's going to happen ;))"
playmindcrack,36dxzd,Lavalampkap,4,Tue May 19 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"ya im sad to see it go too, cant imagine what all the top players that were purposefully not playing until summer so they didnt get a point advantage over their friends in school are gonna feel like, but i guess most of them will get a nice badge to remember the good times :("
playmindcrack,36dxzd,sindalee,4,Tue May 19 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"that's what i like too, the varied ways it can be played. it's also an incredibly unique game to all of the mini game sites.    if you look at many peoples time played on this game, it is an investment. sure it's not back to back 10 minute pvp games, but it's not that kind of game to begin with, and not everyone likes to burn out straight pvp 24/7."
playmindcrack,36dxzd,Mercury321,1 point,Wed May 20 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"It's a great concept, it just needs some updates and some life."
playmindcrack,36dxzd,BlueCyann,2,Sat May 23 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"What's your IGN?  I don't recognize you at a glance.  Anyway, my thoughts:  Disagree somewhat that 1.8 mining fatigue is game-breaking.  Extremely annoying, YES; however, you can adapt and play and I'm here to prove it, as I've been using a 1.8 client the entire time I've played RoC, not realizing until after the update that there was any difference.  I even won two seasons, for all that I didn't have a ton of competition.  Getting out of an exhausted low-level cave takes a painful amount of time if you've lost your entrance (as I always do); choosing to dig for lava sounds or through a one-high obsidian lake is painful as heck, but it can be done.  I mean, if you're willing to sit there fishing for hours on end you should be willing to do that.  (You can also blast mine a little; sometimes it helps.)  Which brings me to my second point of disagreement.  I hate the fishing.  I really do.  I do not consider full diamond without enchants anything remotely in the same league as full diamond with enchants.  I mean, power V bow?  Forget it.  You have no chance.   And I'm unwilling to spend hours right-clicking every 30 seconds.  It's not like you can even AFK it.  It's brutal tedium.  It's not a good use of anyone's time.  Since you can't compete directly against other players without hours and hours of fishing, I think you ultimately wind up turning people off from trying.  This is the main reason I've never sought out a fight, for instance.  (Minor reason #1: I suck.  Minor reason #2: I could beat newbies who are still in half iron, but that would make me feel bad.)  I've won only because the map is huge, the number of players is small, and I usually played at hours of the day when I could get to 0,0 unopposed whenever I wanted to.  I do agree with most of the rest, although a 3-4 day match would feel too short, coming in as late as I did and accustomed to something more like a couple of weeks.  They way my play patterns are, that wouldn't even be enough time to finish one cave."
playmindcrack,36dxzd,t3hero,2,Mon May 18 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"game breaking means it makes the game no fun for noobies and the fewer of those playing the longer the game drags on which discourages even more from playing which makes the game longer etc.  As far as the fishing thing someone with unenchanted armor and a notch apple vs someone with full enchanted gear.  Guy with enchants spent 50x longer and is at a severe disadvantage if they get close.  Guy that spent ages fishing SHOULD have a pvp advantage, its a very high amt of sucky work to get a totally random (if any) benefit.  New people do not have to fish and probably should not at first.  Its not like a new person or player that doesnt fish has no chance against someone with (even the best) enchants.  I mentioned notch apples which shouldnt be a big leap from full diamond armor, but even if you cannot be bothered to work that hard tnt does 10000x dmg so no matter how good their armor is, if they take any damage from a tnt they die and you get all their hard earned armor along with any and all gapples they had.  So to say you cant compete directly against someone without fishing is silly, and also there is no need to fight anyone if youre not spending your time fishing.  Fishing gives you a pvp edge which you can use to kill people and if youre very lucky that can result in stealing points off their bodies, but someone who spends all that time or even half that time caving has a big points advantage if they can just avoid running into these few players which is very very easy with there being almost nobody playing RoC anymore.  There are many good ways to play the game and many of them dont require any fishing at all.   Fishing is an extra mechanic that adds variety to the game  my IGN is same as here, you can find me on any of the RoC leaderboards xD im on all of em im pretty sure"
playmindcrack,36dxzd,BlueCyann,4,Tue May 19 05:42:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yah I forgot I put that up there. We decided to we are going to remove ROC instead of remaking it.

playmindcrack,36dxzd,arcanesachin,-13,Tue May 19 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"You're completely correct, how dare I offer badges, we should just remove the game without giving out any at all."

playmindcrack,36dxzd,Wifi_LC,7,Tue May 19 05:23:27 2015 UTC,Just top 10? Why not 100?
playmindcrack,36dxzd,arcanesachin,-7,Tue May 19 01:27:04 2015 UTC,Because its not a popular enough of a game to warrant such a large badge give-out.
playmindcrack,36dxzd,t3hero,9,Tue May 19 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this. It was really popular and you can't claim it was not a popular game when there are over 100 people who have spent entire 3 days on this game.  Also, if you compare the top 100 of total time spent with Camelot and KGM(I consider them popular), then it's about the same."
playmindcrack,36dxzd,bluu31,-3,Tue May 19 04:58:37 2015 UTC,"Both MSG and DvZ where far more popular, and they have the same amount of badges you are suggestion. No dice."

playmindcrack,35z80v,TitaniumForce,0,Mon May 18 00:11:45 2015 UTC,Kind of balances the bandage vs. the flask but dunno.
playmindcrack,35z80v,soupbob,11,Thu May 14 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"With the flask, the person has to keep visiting the water in order to refill, and triggers a 20 second cooldown, which you can utilize their set's weaknesses and kill them while they are on cooldown. With the bandage, someone can run away while healing and also heal in battle, and when paired with the illusionary blade this makes it ridiculously atrocious to fight against because they can also utilize spells since they are gaining mana from the blade as well, again at the same time healing while fighting without penalty.  EDIT: I do not see any reason why soupbob needs to be downvoted. He's pointing out his honest opinion and he does not know, there is no reason to be negative towards what he has said."

However, changing it to screenshots of the actual games might be clashing with the style of the presentation of the other games. And with the new upcoming lobby, where every game will get it's own little area (as stated here), the whole overview has to be overhauled anyway. So i'm not sure if it's really worth the while to change it now."

playmindcrack,35tgge,BlueCyann,2,Tue May 19 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Stupid CrackAttack question:  When you're attacking another team's point, how on earth do you break in past the walls?  I can't seem to break blocks or build, either one.  I've gone around in the the past, but what if there is no around?  Also, the rules suggest there is iron somewhere in the quarry, but I've for sure never found it.  Is it actually there?"
playmindcrack,35tgge,Noppe,3,Wed May 13 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"You can break blocks, hardened cobblestone needs to be broken 3 time before it turns into regular cobblestone, though which might be what occured with you.  Not being able to place blocks in the enemy team was a simple fix for not skybasing to other teams, which is good, but should be changed into a height limit for the enemy team. It would fix spending an hour trying to defeat the final team.  For the iron, haven't seen it myself, but people say it's at the bottom."
playmindcrack,35tgge,BlueCyann,2,Wed May 13 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I never tried a block more than once and I don't think I ever tried digging dirt, so that's probably what happened.  I'd like to try out the game with permission to place blocks, too, though as you say, if skybridges are to be discouraged, it'd take some tweaking as to how high each team can build.  You'd wind up with some block spam, but the areas are so big and the teams (at least at this time) so small it shouldn't be much of a problem.  I'd also love water at times, though maybe that's opening cans of worms that shouldn't be opened."
playmindcrack,35tgge,Sanjisama,1 point,Wed May 13 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Building walls would be pointless if you can get over them with 3 blocks.         I don't think that the ability tobuild needs to be changed, there are games where it would make a really long games slightly shorter but it would also shorten loads of normal games and would make it so no one made walls because they would just be jumped over."
playmindcrack,35tgge,Noppe,1 point,Wed May 13 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"That's the whole point of the height limit, just being able to build 2-3 high up would help tremendously already, and wouldn't mess up walls.  Kind of forgot to mention that I had a 3 block height limit in mind rather than 10"
playmindcrack,35tgge,Sanjisama,1 point,Wed May 13 14:53:23 2015 UTC,"That could be interesting but that might still be a bit much, since the base areas slopes towards he center it would be kinda hard to set up or you would be able to build like 10 blocks up at the start ofthe area and then the intended 2-3 right next to the base soto prevent any easy breaching of the wall you would have to make it both really high and thick.        The commitment to make a wall that big could mean by the time you're finished the other teams have already got iron armor and if you didn't find any mortar it can still be breached really easily."
playmindcrack,35tgge,Noppe,2,Wed May 13 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"Most current walls aren't flawless either. A good wall is thick, higher than 3 and made out of hardened stone. Then there's the thing which is never done, the dirt. You can dig underneath as easily as with blocks to jump. But you do make a point and after thinking about blockglitching, you can jump 5 high walls with those 3 blocks. If it were to be added, it should be 2.  Also, let's get a crackattack game going :3"
playmindcrack,35tgge,BlueCyann,1 point,Wed May 13 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"But it would also open up alternative means of defense.  I have to admit I'm a little biased against walls, personally.  You fall off them, it's difficult to kill off people outside them, and they block sight SO bad.  However, if the idea of a walled base is what the game designers want, then maybe no-build is what is needed in order to get that, because if it were up to me I'd probably dispense with the walls entirely and just dig ditches.  I think shortening normal games is not necessarily a problem in itself.  I'm not entirely a fan of the way that teams are redistributed right now after one team goes down.  Ideally I'd prefer a more fluid game where both sides would have a realistic chance to win and for that you'd need to make it easier to break a defense, not harder.  But again, that's a choice that's dependent on what kind of game you want to play."
playmindcrack,35tgge,palmtree5,1 point,Wed May 13 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"You have to make a pickaxe to break through the other team's defenses. As for the iron, it's really deep in the quarry, you have to do a lot of digging to find it"

The most I've ever done myself in terms of delay is spend part of a night up a tree in a forest because I was just that exhausted I needed a break.  But I hate to see UHC ""softened"" just because some people erroneously think they can't cope with the night, or learn to in very short order.  Of all skills needed to learn to play UHC well, that has to be the easiest."

Also you want your own opinion to be respected, yet you don't allow for others to share their differing opinion. Rob even had to reprimand you on this, and you claimed to be 'open' for other opinions but a couple of days later you are already telling people to 'stfu' If that isn't rude, than I don't know what is.  Why on earth would you even go and start spilling shit on the PMC guys. Is this a attempt to be found funny by the DvZ community? Is this the way you see as redeeming yourself?  The things you say are offensive and not to mention incorrect. Currently the playerbase of PMC is bigger than that of DvZ and even Rob himself has told everyone to not white knight him on Crack Attack.

playmindcrack,35gmzs,Chlobe,3,Sun May 10 07:19:55 2015 UTC,I really don't think that a mindcracker being online should be a reason to play. To me that's just the same as saying that people will not watch Mindcrack videos or live streams unless it's done in minecraft.  A reason to play is because you like the games. So if you like the games then you should just go play. Not wait till a Mindcracker gets online to play.
playmindcrack,35gmzs,t3hero,9,Sun May 10 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"No, we would see a drastic spike of players online when Mindcrackers where, and they would never join back. We are in the middle of implementing new ideas to hook players to the games, not just the Mindcrackers presence."

playmindcrack,35gmzs,soupbob,9,Sun May 10 04:41:43 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure why there is an arcade. It just makes the games inside of it (which are as big/well polished) hidden from newcomers. I feel like PMC doesn't have enough games to warrant some of them being hidden up in the arcade.

Revenge of Cookie was a fun concept, but because I wasn't around when it was up, I didn't get to play. All those servers are empty now. Camelot, after the new lobby and Rob left, was moved to the arcade. Empty. Even if small, I think all games should get an area. Unrelated, the old arcade building was awesome."
playmindcrack,35gmzs,lotloxa,2,Sat May 23 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"I thought the purpose of the arcade was to store older games which were no longer being updated, so that you would also be able to highlight the new games that were being made.

I also think it has to do with exams and stuff coming up for us still in school or collage. Once summer comes there's probably going to be a rise in players.  Also, It seems like the server is dying due to the weird way lobbies work. It'd seem so much more alive if everyone was in 1 lobby."
playmindcrack,35gmzs,MrShourin,3,Mon May 11 01:28:30 2015 UTC,Agreed!! RoC is one that needs a overhaul. This is no different from UHC. People who don't have the gold for a UHC ticket can play RoC as a way to practice for when they get the chance to play UHC. However the use of mining fatigue kinda kills the game and it needs to go. Caving is almost un-doable with it. It also slows down your attacks and you can get overwhelmed by a few zombies just because it can take forever to swing your sword.
playmindcrack,35gmzs,PickShark,2,Mon May 11 03:39:24 2015 UTC,mining fatigue doesnt affect attack speed. its purely visual
playmindcrack,35gmzs,Bird-of-Fire,1 point,Mon May 11 04:10:39 2015 UTC,Indeed. If they do the 'ores don't spawn below 48 unless near a cave' thing with RoC then the Mining Fatigue is unneeded.
playmindcrack,35gmzs,BlueCyann,1 point,Tue May 12 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"Though to be honest they might need to tweak that plug-in a bit, as it has its share of failures.  Over the time frame of a UHC the difference is not significant to me, as you can still find more stuff caving.  For RoC, though, with weeks worth of time to waste if you want, it might be more of an issue in terms of gold found vs golden apples consumed in order to get it.  But I'm not honestly sure."

playmindcrack,35en1n,Imhotep0,3,Sat May 9 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"I'm all for a compromise, but the game no longer allows for stacked potions, that's why I changed them. And obviously the community is split down the middle with this, so I don't see us changing it anytime soon. But feel free to make suggestions to how we should tackle this issue."
playmindcrack,35en1n,t3hero,2,Sat May 9 20:13:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know that. How about including two instant damage I potions in each chest instead? They may not stack, but you have more than enough room in the hotbar to keep them there. It also makes it so someone can't have 20 pots on their hotbar."
playmindcrack,35en1n,VintageDrummer1,3,Sat May 9 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind them coming two at a time. This also makes it so the most someone can throw is 9, but most likely will be 5-7 at the very most. This would stop potspam and bring pots back to the way I think they should be used, and that's defensively not offensively reasons."
playmindcrack,35en1n,t3hero,1 point,Sat May 9 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"All that would do is effectively just remove one hotbar slot, but still cause the same amount of damage. I dont know about you, but the time between throwing two potions and one is unnoticeably small."
playmindcrack,35en1n,justinthelew11,2,Sat May 9 20:23:12 2015 UTC,I would be fine with just 1 Instant Damage I potion but a lot of people probably wouldn't like that. There is also a bit of a cooldown between taking damage from pots and you get knocked back a bit which makes it a bit harder to hit both of them dead on.

It's a consensus. There's no way to ask every single person who plays survival games so you ask a handful of people.   Potions were put into msg for a reason. It's supposed to balance the random factor of where you spawn and how many chests you get.   Adding another random factor doesn't balance everything out. IT just makes the matches more random.

Well is it fair that the jimmy spawned on melon tree island, had one chest he could get, and that chest happened to have a damage potion.   Is it fair that Jimmy spawned on the melon tree island, had one chest he could get, and that chest happened to contain a wood sword? He gets to the main island and is about to kill someone who opened more chests and had more armour than him just to get killed by a splash damage potion.   Its what makes msg different from the other hundred survival games out there.    What makes Mindcrack SG different is the ability to obtain books and enchant your tools, not the fact that you could win a match being armourless when the other guy has prot 2 iron."
playmindcrack,35en1n,chuck2354,5,Sat May 9 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"You know what I've seen the light, but why stop at removing damage potions. I think when you kill someone you should get a regen 10 buff for 2 seconds restoring you to full health. This effectively removes cleanup because its so not fair that jimmy had no armor and a wooden sword, and killed me when I had 1 heart left from fighting someone with enchanted iron like myself. You know what lets also ban anyone who is caught teaming because it isn't fair that i had to fight 3 people at the same time and die to it. They ruined my game while they were just trying to have fun with each other so they should be banned.  Hey guess what no matter how unfair you think it is that you died. No matter how much you think you should have won that fight. You are dead now. Gyro isn't going to magically appear and revive you just because you think it is unfair that you died to some one using   a way of getting a quick cheap kill.   There are no cheap kills. There is no magical honor list that defines how it is ok to kill someone and how it isn't. Its called Mindcrack SURVIVAL games. You survive in any way possible as long as you aren't breaking server rules.  The only reason you don't like damage potions is because you die to them when you think you should have won. Get over it and learn to adapt and SURVIVE them. Little armour less jimmy cant kill you with a damage potion if you fill him with arrows long before he gets close to you, but you assumed that because he had no armour he would be an easy kill, went in with your sword, and are now pissed because you died. Or you were sorting through someone stuff and he snuck up behind you and killed you with it. In the end it comes down to how they want to balance the game, or actually who can whine about it the loudest on the reddit and get them to change it."
playmindcrack,35en1n,Noppe,6,Sat May 9 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"I can exaggerate too.   Why don't we add strength II pots and protection 10 armour? There are no cheap kills.

The point is, more than half the people don't like how strong potions are and feel like it will improve gameplay to nerf them. This is the part I'm not getting. People are requesting to NERF the pots, not remove them completely. We're trying to come up with a compromise but you're here ""whining"" (to put it in your terms) because you want to keep them the same. Seems a little selfish doesn't it?"

You are trying to come up with a compromise to something that's already been nerfed twice because your 54% wont stop complaining and just play the game. You just want to compromise. No you want to take more and more away from the potions like you already have until they are removed. Oh and as far as your protection 10 armour and strength II potions.

You are trying to come up with a compromise to something that's already been nerfed twice because your 54% wont stop complaining and just play the game.    The last ""nerf"" ended up making pots stronger than ever and people didn't like that. From what you're saying, it seems like you rely too much on pots yourself.   You just want to compromise. No you want to take more and more away from the potions like you already have until they are removed.   And if the majority wants them to be removed, then they probably should.  I personally would love it if they were, but I could settle with stacked instant damage I potions. I probably still won't use them, but at least they won't be insanely OP."

You have 54% of the people. That while technically is a majority isn't really a majority its about half. You keep saying ""oh we have the majority we have the majority so we should get our changes."" You have the majority of people on the reddit. When you do a survey you typically go to more than one place to get you sample or you get people that say well people on the reddit are more likely to want potions to be nerfed than people on the actual server. Realistically here you don't have a majority you have about half.  Oh and as far as them being more powerful than ever. Which is more power full one damage II pot or 20 damage I pots i got by mixing the stacks. It depends on the situation, but most people would probably take the 20."

playmindcrack,34kyyv,aalexcamirandd,2,Sat May 2 08:44:32 2015 UTC,"Kind of an ""almost incredible moment"" -- in the game that just finished, I went first-day caving and then looked for spiders at night (didn't find any ...), but amazingly, came across an untouched desert temple right at dawn.  It had five diamonds, and there was a lava pool 100 blocks away.  I'd have had enchants at 20 minutes with zero (deep) caving if not for lapis.  It turned into an ordinary game after that, punctuated by cave spider poisoning and recovery, lack of ability to find weaker players to kill, and the usual fatal final encounter with the best player in the game.  But that moment was nice.  Probably my favorite moment would be ordinary for most people, -- winning a bow battle.  I was happy."

playmindcrack,34gizd,Lavalampkap,5,Fri May 1 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is that more people leave their Skype open during the day than Mumble, it's more likely that someone will remain logged onto Skype and see messages there. Also this group isn't designed for people to speak to one another, it's text based, and moderated. It'll be easier for players who wish to communicate with members of the community via text to do so here than on Mumble in my opinion. Also, a lot of people are unfamiliar with Mumble and prefer Skype's interface, considering how many applicants we've received I'm going to assume that this will be frequently used."
playmindcrack,34gizd,BlueCyann,8,Fri May 1 20:04:00 2015 UTC,^ Also some people (unfortunately like me) are very uncomfortable talking on Mumble or TS.

It might happen that this schedule changes from time to time, depending on a number of factors, like if we have to perform maintenance etc.  When in doubt, the in-game countdown is the last-word on when the next game will start, as it's based off of the scheduler. In this particular case, I've verified that the next game will indeed start at pm UTC (which matched the in-game countdown)."
playmindcrack,34ek4o,olmok,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:27:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. Is it starting every 2 hours now (instead of 3) because there is more demand for UHC?

Since games are already queued up, it takes a while for changes to take effect, which is why we didn't see this until, well a while ago. It'll be reversed and games back on their normal schedule once it starts scheduling games according to the correct schedule again!  Edit: ping /u/Mario3573Z so that he sees the reply too! :)"
playmindcrack,34ek4o,SteampunkMittens,4,Thu Apr 30 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"Is it likely that the schedule will ever change? Or if there will be a game every 1 hour instead of 3 every 3 hours?

Obviously it's not going to be changed to suit my needs, but I'm just wondering if it'll ever be altered."

Our schedule is balanced around a lot of factors, one of the most important ones is our ability to moderate UHC. We pride ourselves in having a one of the most closely moderated UHC-games available, and lowering that standard would not be a viable long term sollution.  That said, there's nothing saying we wont adjust the schedule to either launch at different times or more frequently in the future, we just don't have anything plans to do that right now."

But if you play Crack Attack you would notice this game plays completely different. If you enjoy DvZ, play DvZ, this is Crack Attack. If we wanted to make a rip-off of DvZ we would have gone through every hoop to get approval and support from Rob, but we didn't, we made Crack Attack."

playmindcrack,33wvuv,DCbarley,4,Sun Apr 26 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I don't mind the challenge, personally, but it's going to leave a lot of bad feelings when people lose half their health or die to weather on the first day.  Something else on my wish list -- some kind of biome tweak for fewer forests.  Not none, but oak forest at zero,zero five games in a row gets old fast.  Also nether fix.  I don't like what I've heard of the results of trying force a fortress at zero,zero all the time; and the border must be the same size as the overworld one."
playmindcrack,33wvuv,BlueCyann,3,Sun Apr 26 12:34:51 2015 UTC,The reason there is no ocean biome is our ClassPatch for removing oceans replaces them with forests.
playmindcrack,33wvuv,gyroninja,3,Sun Apr 26 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, that explains much. Any way to make that replacement more varied?  The forests really are pretty excessive, and when they're at 0,0 it's worse, because next to jungles they're by far the most annoying/tiring biome to move through.  When you spend a half hour or more near center and it's forest it gets to you."

playmindcrack,33gn4w,BlueCyann,2,Fri Apr 24 10:30:41 2015 UTC,"Any way to get more people playing on the server?  I'm really frustrated right now by it. I want to play UHC, and would be able to play 2-3 times per week, but I find it impossible to make the gold.  The times I can play have next to no one online.  Even the couple of times recently I've deliberately played at a time I don't normally, just to try to get gold in a team game, I've been out of luck.  First try at Blackbeard, after a 10-15 minute wait for a game to start, I had a visitor halfway through.  No gold.  Second time, after another such wait, power outage.  No gold.  Third time I sat around over 20 minutes waiting, but never more than 8 people showed up.  All told, well over an hour of ""effort"" with a total of about ten minutes of game play, and you guessed it, zero gold.  I know part of that was just bad luck, but still.  It's just ridiculous.  I can play MSG occasionally, but I'm not good enough to make any reasonable amounts at it."
playmindcrack,33gn4w,bluu31,3,Fri Apr 24 13:28:00 2015 UTC,Camelot gives the most gold (if you pick random at the beginning) and that is usually going around 6 EDT (and more in the weekend).    As for getting more players on PMC that would be doable if Seth or some other popular Mindcrackers would record and upload some minigames.
playmindcrack,33gn4w,BlueCyann,4,Fri Apr 24 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"I've never yet been able to find a game of Camelot to play.  (Got in one once around that time with 30 seconds to go, that's it.  There was no game after that.)  The lack of meaningful Mindcracker support has always baffled me.  Even UHC -- a bunch of videos during the period when almost no one could actually play, and now that it's public, except for Nebris and occasionally Baj or Pakratt streaming, it's crickets."
playmindcrack,33gn4w,DCbarley,4,Fri Apr 24 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's so strange. It's a public server with their brand, including in-game likenesses. It even uses their voices. Yet for most of them, it's like it doesn't even exist. I remember Beef joined for about ten minutes to record a channel update a couple of months back, and he tweeted his presence out. Within a few minutes there were over 300 people on the server. A bit more promotion like that, and they could actually make money off the server.

playmindcrack,33gn4w,CopyCatJ,3,Sun Apr 26 22:42:04 2015 UTC,Honestly your best bet for gold is Kgm it only needs 3 people to start and it gives 30 gold per game

playmindcrack,3333nl,BlueCyann,3,Sun Apr 19 10:05:30 2015 UTC,Mining fatigue was much more lenient in 1.7 than 1.8. You could break blocks at a tolerable rate even with mining fatigue IV. That's why many players preferred 1.7 when playing RoC.
playmindcrack,3333nl,Mamppu,2,Sun Apr 19 11:37:36 2015 UTC,"Well.  That explains a lot.  I always played in 1.8 and would be baffled at people's various comments that they were ""going stripmining"" or bragging about the Eff IV picks they'd put together.  That was of no use to me.  The biggest annoyance is getting out of caves when you've lost track of your way in (which for me, is always).  The game can still be played, though, obviously.  (Heck, I won two seasons.)"
playmindcrack,3333nl,BlueCyann,4,Sun Apr 19 12:15:13 2015 UTC,I'm surprised Revenge of Cookie hasn't been updated to use the no stripmining plug-in from UHC yet. Much better than mining fatigue.

playmindcrack,332tiv,AbdealiGames,3,Sat Apr 18 23:58:25 2015 UTC,"I feel as if people would end up farming gold this way by starting a game with themself and a friend/alt account, and then making something like blackbeard go on for as long as possible. And considering patrons can get silver, it could easily pay out for more than you use. Anyway, most games aren't that fun with so few people playing, and at certain times in the day those games tend to have a lot of players.  Interesting idea though."
playmindcrack,332tiv,SteampunkMittens,3,Sun Apr 19 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I think it would be permitted under Mojang's rules about server monetisation as no silver is required to join the game. In fact it's less of a grey area than things like reserved patron slots.  But there would be a lot to think about, the player requirement would still need to be higher for some games (can't really play Camelot with 2 players, for example).  There are also occasions when players shouldn't be allowed to do this. For example, today we had 2 Pajama Jam Time games open - on a normal day the chances of one game starting are very slim, the chances for the second game probably nil. Under this system you'd be able to start both games with 2 players each, which would obviously not be beneficial to either game - but new server tech might be required to implement this, which may not be worthwhile. Ideally you wouldn't want to allow players to force start games if there are already any active servers for that game.  All in all probably not worth the effort for them to add this in a foolproof way. A better solution to consider might be a DvZ-style system where the player requirement reduces over time (so it might start at 10 but after 30 minutes of waiting it's down to 4, so you at least get the gave you've waited for)."
playmindcrack,332tiv,Tomlough,3,Sun Apr 19 02:03:03 2015 UTC,KGM only needs three people to start and it's really lame to only be able to fight every twentish seconds. That's assuming the other players know the map.

playmindcrack,33071v,PickShark,4,Mon Apr 20 01:47:06 2015 UTC,wow... the results are shocking atm
playmindcrack,33071v,Noppe,-1,Sat Apr 18 11:55:17 2015 UTC,Not really honestly. The majority of people who play msg aren't good at PvP so they see potions as a way to win. Or at least give them a chance. Potions are a casual players best friend and they serve a pretty important role in the game. Maybe the frequency could go down a lot but honestly I don't think they are bad.
playmindcrack,33071v,Imhotep0,2,Sat Apr 18 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"It explains why there's so many people who like them, but I don't get why most people think it's a reason they should be in the game."
playmindcrack,33071v,Noppe,2,Sat Apr 18 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"MSG would have died a long time ago without them. They encourage people to keep playing because they manage a kill. It might be a kill from a potion but its encouragement. without that its really easy to get discouraged and not get a kill for 20-30 games. Why would you keep playing if you never kill anyone? by making the underdogs have a chance, you keep them coming back and help prevent MSG from being a game played exclusively by the people who are good at it"
playmindcrack,33071v,Waffle1099,3,Sat Apr 18 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"From what I understand right now, you see potions as something you can use to get a kill, no matter the skill of the person using. That seems a bit like an item which 1-shots a person. From perspective A it's just a regular kill, while perspective B is just BS. Now potions aren't one shot, but in many cases it has the same result. That's why there's people who hate them.  Now I don't get why you'd think MSG would die out without potions. Looking at other servers, they seem to be doing fine without potions. I think the games would run the same way as now, without the people complaining, everyone still getting kills. If you look at kgm, where there's people who are ridiculously good and extremely hard to kill. I don't see any complaints over that.  It doesn't take a genius to see that potions aren't essential to the game. The game is unique either way, with the Minecrack maps, enchanting and scatter system. The only thing I really want to hear is from a dev, explaining why they think it should be kept in the game, why it is worth having it with the constant complaints.  There's also something which never seems to be talked about, but extremely OP, flame. (Only when a person doesn't have fire res)"

playmindcrack,33071v,PickShark,3,Sat Apr 18 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"You say that pots are in the game for balance, basically items which grant an easy kill and require almost no skill making it extremely frustrating to die to, so it'd be fun?   This is also looking at it one way where only unlucky people get to use them, everyone gets them in the game. I don't know how many games I ended by spamming 5 pots against the last person alive just because I had them."
playmindcrack,33071v,Noppe,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"What I like about MSG is variety. Both Flame and potions add to that variety. It makes fighting less bland and more tactical. Flame weapons add the aspect of using water and water buckets as a counter to them. While I liked the Damage I potions better than the Damage II, the idea of a hidden weapon is interesting. People show their armor and often their sword/bow but the use of potions is always a suprise. Potions also add the choice of going for chest loot instead of going for enchants for decent weaponry.  Skill should not always trump tactics."
playmindcrack,33071v,MinecrackBot,2,Sat Apr 18 17:40:59 2015 UTC,You can barely counter flame with a water bucket. You need to stop mid battle to place water allowing your enemy to just ignite you again. I wouldn't be complaining about it if you could counter it consistantly.
playmindcrack,33071v,BlueCyann,0,Sat Apr 18 17:55:55 2015 UTC,This is a small server. It doesn't warrant the traffic other SG servers have. Its pretty important in that it makes msg a little more unique. Personally I stop using pots once I have enchants because I think their place is purely early game. Maybe clearing them from inventories after a certain time would help balance it. As for flame.. I hate it more than anything in the game. Its so ridiculous. Before pots get removed flame should
playmindcrack,33071v,PickShark,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's why I mentioned it, it's generally known flame is obnoxious to fight against without fire res no matter what. But it's just such an ignored thing :p  I don't think pots should be mentioned in MSG when we talk about it being unique. are there any other servers which use Mindcrack maps, book enchanting, a random scatter?  Making people unable to use pots after a certain time is the best thing I've heard to do something for both parties! I know it's possible to do... but will it happen?"
playmindcrack,33071v,BlueCyann,-1,Sat Apr 18 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"It seems you've had your words mixed up, my good chum!  I think you mean to say Mindcrack or Minecraft.  As far as I know, mindcraft and minecrack are not correct."
playmindcrack,33071v,PickShark,3,Sat Apr 18 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really disagree.  I suck at MSG, but I don't see potions as a positive for players in my position.  I can barely cope with sword and bow, you know?  There's been way too often I've gone into a fight with what I thought was a health or gear advantage, only 'glass breaks' and I'm dead before I can blink. The good players will always be better at taking advantage of them than I am.  They are worse than useless to me.  The one place I've found them useful is when I had no gear at all otherwise.  But I've still never actually won a fight by using them that way, that I would otherwise have lost.  (My best attempt ever, I was actually beating the guy, only to punch him over a fence I couldn't cross.  I just sat there laughing.)  The majority of my kills are opportunistic, and it's going to stay that way unless I get better.  Potions don't change that equation, and losing to them feels approximately as crappy as when I spawn with no chest and die with no gear at all.  Or when I get nailed by flame/fire aspect -- those are ""fun"", too.  Maybe I'm in a minority of bad pvpers here, but you couldn't be more wrong about me."
playmindcrack,33071v,BlueCyann,-1,Sat Apr 18 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"Judging by survey results, I would say most people would rather then stay. They're part of the game and can easily shift the balance of a fight"
playmindcrack,32y72n,BlueCyann,10,Fri Apr 17 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"It's the whole server. When someone gets killed, the server sometimes lags. It started since the website got updated, so I'm guessing it has to do with stats being sent to the website and something not being alright with that.  Now if this happens often in UHC, before pvp even, it might just be everything related with stats such as gold, and fall damage, etc"
playmindcrack,32y72n,Noppe,3,Fri Apr 17 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"Someone walked into lava before I died, but that was a minute or two earlier I think.  PvP wasn't on yet.  Maybe you're right about it being the other stats.    In any case, it needs to be fixed!"
playmindcrack,32y72n,olmok,3,Fri Apr 17 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"It's not database related, the database calls have no ability to lock up the games like this and even more so, the stats-reset was invisible to the games and wouldn't be able to affect the game servers.

playmindcrack,32rbyq,CatNinja101,4,Thu Apr 16 02:16:46 2015 UTC,I like this idea! I think it would spice things up a bit.
playmindcrack,32rbyq,kiakey,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:37:20 2015 UTC,And it could use /title to announce the options at the start.

playmindcrack,32pth0,BlacklistOG,6,Wed Apr 15 19:09:43 2015 UTC,UHC is one of those game that should NOT be rushed. Every other game on the server Is rush rush rush. This is how they are designed and it works fine. These are action games. They are meant to be like that. But UHC it action / strategy. You have to plan things out and this takes time. If you rush UHC it becomes no fun to play. People will die due to rushed decisions. People will not want to play and leave in favor of other UHC servers.  If you really have no time to play then plan ahead. The game is always there. Pick a time / day to have a nice UHC game. You do not have to be there 24/7. Nor do you have to play every game. A way to decrease wait times is to have more than 1 server. BUT have a 3 hr cool down before a player can join a new game after joining a game. This is so anyone can play in any time zone.
playmindcrack,32pth0,MrShourin,2,Thu Apr 16 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree that UHC is a game that shouldn't be rushed, there are plenty of other servers out there that give 60, 90, and 120 minute games. Why should I go on PMC and wait up to three hours for a game, then spend three hours playing the game when I could have played an enjoyable UHC on another server in much less time?   For me, the games simply aren't available when I want to play - I want to be able to hop on the server when I feel like it and play, not have an urge to play UHC and then have to wait some time before actually playing.   I think that if something doesn't change with either the amount of UHC games going on at one time, or have specific ""shorter"" rounds, then people are just not going to want to play anymore."
playmindcrack,32pth0,themanoftacos,3,Thu Apr 16 02:31:49 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's nice to have pmc uhc but if you know of the alternatives most of them are better, currently :P there's usually a reddit game every 15 minutes, twitter games are announced 30-ish minutes before they open, badlion games are every hour-ish depending on the hosts, hypixel has automated UHC always open, etc."
playmindcrack,32pth0,Silver_Moonrox,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"I do understand why the games take as long as they do and love it as I mentioned by saying a good UHC takes more than 2 hours. My issue is that I would like to play more and also maybe get in games with people I recognize on the server. I am unable to do this, however, because the maximum number of games I can play is only about 2-4 only on the weekend. The main issue is the 3 hour wait between sets of games. I do understand why that is a thing but it would be cool if there could be multiple games at the start of every hour to help this but it is not a complaint I have."
playmindcrack,32pth0,mythbustman,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that UHC games should not be rushed, but since I too can't play a UHC for more than two hours during weekdays and weekends. That would apply to the majority of the player base too. TBH I would like to see some sort of time constraint, like 1.5-2 hours and after that time the border quickly shrinks or something."
playmindcrack,32pth0,uxhy,5,Thu Apr 16 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"This is also my issue with UHC, each game simply takes to long for me to play it in the weekdays, so I barely get to play it.  Oh well!"

playmindcrack,32pth0,SteampunkMittens,3,Wed Apr 15 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the games are either running when I'm at college, one starts as soon as I leave to get home, one usually runs through the time I eat dinner, then after that they're a bit too late if I actually want to get sleep. Daylight savings really screwed up the schedule for me, so now I can't play as much :S"
playmindcrack,32pth0,Imhotep0,2,Wed Apr 15 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with only being able to play weekends? As someone who played private ones with friends 2-3 times a week for about 2 months, you quickly become bored of the game.   You may hate that you can only play once a week now, but when you're still enjoying it in 6 months you'll be grateful :p"
playmindcrack,32pth0,BlueCyann,2,Thu Apr 16 08:45:13 2015 UTC,"I may as well add that I'm going to run into a different version of ""can hardly play"".  That's to do with gold.  I've just run out (actually I think I have just barely enough for one more game, but yeah).  MSG is pretty much literally the only game that has enough players for consistent games most of the times that I can play, and I suck at it to the tune of maybe 20 gold per hour.  Maybe.  So I don't expect I will be able to play much anymore unless player count somehow vastly increases."
playmindcrack,32pth0,LightningPig30,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Imo they should have some sort of meetup at 0,0 after a certain amount of time. This time could vary for the three servers ex: 60,90,120 mins. This could be similar to how /r/ultrahardcore does it, which is very enjoyable"
playmindcrack,32pth0,BlueCyann,2,Thu Apr 16 03:15:06 2015 UTC,"How do you enforce it, though?  It would turn into some version of Eximius, which meetup IMO really sucks.  Or doesn't Badlion do teleports or something?  Also not ideal.  I've grown to quite like the border, personally.  If anything I might prefer it be tweaked to speed up slightly, but it's not terrible.  Like a lot of people commenting, I trained myself on PVE with a 90 minute time limit akin to /r/ultrahardcore.  It's taken a bit of mental adjustment to slow down, not to rush myself unnecessarily, but I think overall it's probably a friendlier experience (especially to new players) this way.  And it's definitely different.  I do hope it finds its audience.  As to the main point, UHCs at more varied times, should that ever happen, would be welcome to me at least.  One hour earlier than the current schedule would put a game in the perfect spot for me every day.  Right now it's an awkward fit."
playmindcrack,32pth0,LightningPig30,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"You provide a lot of very good points and have made me change my mind. Now i feel that the slower games are in some ways better, but i feel i still prefer the more fast paced gameplay and not having to wait so long just for another game to play.  The long games are cool however they are not for people like me who have a very small margin of time to play everyday (1 hour at most)"

In 75 minutes.  Unfortunately I didn't have leather or a bow (and while being stalked, accidentally transformed 7 diamonds into pants instead of a hat and two left over, at that), so no enchants; and the first enchanted guy I came across had a horse.  I tried to lure him into a forest for the fight, but he saw the notch apple and wisely ran.  I unwisely followed, because that's what I do. :p  Ultimately I did reasonable damage, despite losing, so I'm happy.  He was happy about the armor. :p  (And went on to win the game.)"
playmindcrack,32fico,TJtheObscure,2,Mon Apr 13 11:32:12 2015 UTC,I had one a while back that had something like 9 diamond veins. Ended up in full diamond with 4 diamond blocks. Still lost though.
playmindcrack,32fdia,DCbarley,7,Mon Apr 13 10:07:10 2015 UTC,MSG is more a game of luck than the majority of people who complain about pots make it out to be.   Is it any fairer for you to get an easy kill with full chain/iron armour and a stone sword against someone who found gold boots and a wooden sword?  They offer a balance to someone who would otherwise have no chance in a fight because they got unlucky with their chests.
playmindcrack,32fdia,Imhotep0,6,Mon Apr 13 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"Very well said. I understand it's frustrating to die when you're doing that well, but MSG is simply not all about getting the best gear and being the most skilled. How boring would it be if the most skilled people always won, over and over and over again because they're good at those two things? Things like potions give others who might not be so great, or those who got extremely unlucky with chests a chance at winning, or at least doing a little better than their gear would let them.  Another note- pots only do that much damage if they hit you spot on. The damage varies depending on how accurately the pot hits the player. When fighting someone, it takes at least a little bit of skill to aim the potion correctly when everyone is running around. Yes, it usually is still a significant amount of damage, but still, I believe that potions are important, if not, crucial to the game to balance it for everyone playing, not just the skilled players."
playmindcrack,32fdia,sarar3sistance,2,Mon Apr 13 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying - good points.    However the reason I want potions removed isn't because of 'spam', or lack of skill - I want them removed because the frustration they bring is far greater than any benefit they add to the gameplay. Potions have their uses and benefits, but they take away from my enjoyment of the game. I would have thought having a fun game is more important than having a balanced game.    Edit: I know from asking in game (as well as this thread) that I'm far from the only one of this opinion"
playmindcrack,32fdia,Imhotep0,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"I would have thought having a fun game is more important than having a balanced game.   Balanced and fun are one in the same. An unbalanced game, by definition, will be very un-fun for someone else if it's more fun for you. You have fun killing people in melee, but that isn't fun for someone who keeps dying every single game.  When making comments like this, always think about everyone who plays the game, not just yourself and what you and your friends are good at. I suck at bows and lose 80% of bow duels in UHCs because I'm such a shit shot. Should they be removed because I keep dying to them, and my better enchants and Dia. sword mean nothing when they hit me 4 times and I die? It would make it more fun for me, because I'd actually be able to do something :P  Balance.. balances out the fun, instead of lumping it in with a single group of people.  Oh and, as for your comment about you not being the only one with the opinion, sure. But neither am I, or people who like the pots, as is pretty clear from the votes on the thread :)"
playmindcrack,32fdia,ItzaMeLuigi_,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"I think I'm misrepresenting myself slightly - I'm actually quite good at using potions, I probably have a positive k/d ratio where they're concerned lol :P As for the votes, I presumed my lack of votes was due to the regularity of the topic coming up leading to people being fed up discussing it, but I might be off with that. The comments clearly agree that potions need a nerf.    I also think you're missing what I'm trying to say regarding balance, although you make good very points as to it's nature in relation to the enjoyment of the game. I enjoy playing the game, and fighting people (bows or melee, whatever). Minecraft pvp is a game where small advantages in gear and skill level determine the victor. However in MSG, the victor is usually the one who humps a potion in their opponents face, regardless of other variables. Potions are easy to abuse, and are by far the most overpowered item in the game. Like I said in other comments, I do see a role for potions in MSG as a defensive item that causes knockback and a small amount of damage, and requires skill to use effectively. Not as the single determinant of the outcome of a fight. Btw thanks for participating in this discussion - your arguments are excellent and you're making me second guess myself!

playmindcrack,32fdia,Wifi_LC,-4,Thu Apr 16 22:22:19 2015 UTC,The only way non skilled players are going to be better is to fight. Not sit there and throw damage pots hoping that it hits the person.

However the fact remains that for me it is far more frustrating to be killed by potions than by someone who outgears me early, for whatever reason. In my opinion (and everyone I've asked online) their negative impact far outweighs the positive, and they should be nerfed or removed."

playmindcrack,32f8ti,KKlobb,5,Mon Apr 13 08:54:47 2015 UTC,Well you end up paying to respawn if you die. RoC is basically a relic from a bygone era. It was designed as a gold sink. It was a fun game when there were masses of people around. But now it needs some fundamental overhauls
playmindcrack,32f8ti,PickShark,6,Mon Apr 13 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"you have to pay gold to respawn so people dont constantly respawn (evolved from ""one life"" to be a little more forgiving), I very very rarely ever respawn playing from day 1 to day 30, and if i DO die I just wait for the next round or play mountains.  The game can still be played without any problems and IS played regularly be several people.  I think giving people gold corresponding to their points, even if it was 1 gold per every 10000 points, would be a step in the right direction, especially since its the only game on the server that you can play without waiting in a lobby for hours only to have to give up and go to sleep when you can never get enough people for a single game x.x    Also its the game that takes the longest to play out of all the games but gives the least gold of any game, how does that make sense?"
playmindcrack,32f8ti,cvanaelst,6,Mon Apr 13 23:22:58 2015 UTC,Gold for points seems the only way to make this work to prevent people from Afk'ing for hours in it.  In a way ROC is a practice game for UHC. It would be great to get rewarded for your efforts in playing the game.

playmindcrack,32f8ti,cvanaelst,2,Wed Apr 15 15:28:09 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I often have a lot of lag so that I can't play many minigames (plus UHC and RoC are all I really care for) so earning levels and gold is not easy. The levels I do have are for the irl days I put into DVZ when it was still on PMC. Gold for points gets my vote! :)
playmindcrack,32f8ti,jloevur,2,Tue Apr 21 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"I still think it would make sense if it gave gold, as paying to get in after dying would be more of a gamble.

While there's no simple benchmark that we could use to determine how much of what would be needed for a re-introduction of the EU-servers, I can say for sure that we're no where near that point right now.  If we continue to grow like we've done the last 3 months or so, we will sooner or later need to make changes to our infrastructure, and there's plenty of options that would benefit players from all continents :) Before the re-introduction of EU-servers, it's likely that we will exhaust all those options first :)"

It doesn't take more than a second more to type /hub quickly or even control + v if you have it copied. We're sorry if that one second is that much of an inconvenience to you, but we encourage you to see its benefits to everyone else."

playmindcrack,31hxxq,Zac91142,4,Sun Apr 5 06:14:36 2015 UTC,"Third, Beef's Island: I feel this map just needs to be replaced tbh.   No no no no no no!!  Beef's is the best map there is. All the other good maps have been removed, don't get them to remove the best one! Also, if you spawn on top a tree, just jump. You get a bit of time of invincibility right after you spawn.  For the other things you mentioned,  I'm with everyone else being against a physical border. I really like the border how it is now.   I think if the damage 2 was changed to 1, it'd be great. They should be used for defense, I feel. If someone gets the jump on you, you can turn around and throw one and knock them back a little to stop their combo. Right now though with damage 2, you can just be sitting still enchanting or something and someone can come up behind you and use them offensively and kill you before you know they're there."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,tkderbrad,2,Sun Apr 5 16:12:24 2015 UTC,A single damage 1 pot isn't nearly enough. Pots are really the great equalizer in msg. If someone has terrible spawns and only gets damage pots and a helmet it allows them to evenly combat someone in chain chest and pants with a stone sword. They are very valuable and need to have some offensive value too. Not just knockback. I think they need less frequent spawns but they should otherwise remain unchanged. The real change needs to be poison pots from 30 seconds to 10-15 seconds.
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,3,Sun Apr 5 19:56:38 2015 UTC,"But, if there's two people with full iron, stone swords, bow and all that. The only difference is one guy has a damage 2 pot. That guy throws the pot and hits the guy head on. 6 hearts of damage. That's not fair."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,stormchaserE,0,Sun Apr 5 21:32:58 2015 UTC,I'm okay with it. Damage is essential. More than likely they'll miss the damage pot. Most people suck with them. And most good pvp players will evade most of the damage. I think damage pots are fine the way they are with the exception of people having 4 or 5 of them. Maybe writing a plugin limiting the amount in an inventory to 2 would be good for the game.
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,3,Sun Apr 5 22:00:47 2015 UTC,It's just really annoying to me when you spend a whole game enchanting and then find a guy with just a few pieces of armor thatn can throw 2 pots at you and kill you without ever getting touched.
playmindcrack,31hxxq,tkderbrad,-1,Sun Apr 5 22:46:42 2015 UTC,I seem to only have problems at the 3rd and 4th damage pot. There needs to be a limit I think. One is just fine to me
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,3,Sun Apr 5 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"One damage pot II pot is annoying and most people use it for offense. I would be ok with one damage I pot, most people would use it for defense."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,stormchaserE,-2,Mon Apr 6 00:05:24 2015 UTC,Damage one is useless. Stacks of 2 damage one would be ideal
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"Imo, what would be ideal would be to remove pots in general. :/"
playmindcrack,31hxxq,stormchaserE,3,Mon Apr 6 00:55:09 2015 UTC,I disagree. They make the game unique and they help remove a bit of the randomness and luck. They help equalize the game and give any player a chance. If they removed them I'd stop playing msg entirely.
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,4,Mon Apr 6 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hate pots and I wish for them to be removed. But that's just me. For the 1.8 border, I don't think its a bad idea. It would be nice seeing it. And for Beefs Island, whenever I spawn in a tree I  jump down because there is a grace period that lasts about 10 seconds. I don't like the tight pathways, I always hate PvPing in them. I think it's fine to team, I team a lot. When I don't team, it's the best feeling to win a 2v1 or 3v1."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,stormchaserE,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:03:29 2015 UTC,"The pots don't need to be removed, they need to be majorly nerfed (damage and spawnrate). As of now, all you need to have is two instant damage potions to win the game."

playmindcrack,31hxxq,BlueCyann,3,Mon Apr 6 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"I would love to have a border that's visible, but I think the constant speed is fine.  From someone who hasn't played a ton, so take it for what it's worth.  Edit: had some more thinking about this.  As far as I see it, the main benefit of a visible border is that it's much more newbie friendly.  Even as someone pretty familiar with Mindcrack's season 4 spawn I found myself running the wrong way down ""monument road"" upon hearing the drums the second time I played that map.  I only realized I was going the wrong way when I saw PSJ's sandstone build.  I made it back with only a few seconds of nausea, but it wasted significant time.  Someone less familiar with that spawn (or with any of the maps lacking a hugely obvious center point) would probably have trouble in most of their games for a while.  Then there's the whole issue with not even knowing what the drums and such mean -- what you're about to be up against.  A visible border would be impossible to miss the meaning of.  The main and only real drawback I can think of is that the visible border is not permeable even a little bit, so if it catches you inside a house or underground with no reachable exit, you're SOL."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,KKlobb,2,Sun Apr 5 12:29:53 2015 UTC,Yeah Beef's Island can be horrible. So many times I've spawned on the lonely island (which has no gear) and I've had to swim to the main island only to get my ass handed to me because everyone else spawned next to a chest and not in the ocean.
playmindcrack,31hxxq,DjTalica,2,Sun Apr 5 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, had that happen, along with one of the ships or in the ocean village. Someone is just waiting there to kill you."
playmindcrack,31hxxq,VintageDrummer1,4,Sun Apr 5 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"I dont really like the idea of a physical border tbh, If people want to hide they will in a small border anyway people who are out of the border are usually getting gear and those who are lost die to it fast enough.

playmindcrack,31hxxq,Ender_Sword,2,Sun Apr 5 09:11:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with your entire comment. But maybe keep one TBB because its nice to have a team game every once and awhile, but its just way to often now."

Nebris's base the border doesn't even close in enough anyway. Etho's arena is large and people get stuck outside the playing area so it is needed there
playmindcrack,31hxxq,PickShark,2,Sun Apr 5 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"I wish pots spawned less frequently but I love them otherwise. I personally like beefs village. The only map I have a problem with is the nether hub. It's way too dark. Real nether has ambient light so it wouldn't be an issue but because its an over world biome that was changed to nether, it loses that and I think it makes the map bad. As for the border, I think that the invisible border is good because you can risk leaving it to enchant at a station outside, where as you can't leave the 1.8 border. And if you're outside you immediately take damage. Current system works better"

Around September or October all main current players made a gentlemans agreement to stop using skald because it was over powered and we have tried to teach all new players that they shouldn't use it, but some just refused to listen, completely ruining the game. Do you know why it is ower powered? It does the same damage as a berserker or a reaver and gets acces to strenght potions alowing you to two shot scouts without crits, 3 to 5 shot barbarians reavers and berserkers depending on crits in return skald gets 3 to 5 shot by raged berserker classes but during these his you will more than likely take knockback and can easily run away with its far supperior speed and return in a minute with full health and the previous attacker probably hurt, and good luck escaping it. Even if you manage to kill the skald it will be back in the keep in about 40 seconds because its so fast on the road. The desition to nerf skald was not something archer just thought of on the spot, its somethingostly all major camelot players in the last 6 months have agreed was needed and if you fail to see that I can call you nothing but ignorant. Edit typing on phone"
playmindcrack,31awa0,Sanjisama,6,Fri Apr 3 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"So you'd be happy to pay 2000 for a broken class, but now that it's fixed you think it's not worth that much anymore? There are plenty of other classes considered to be underpowered for 2000 gold that I don't see you complaining about (Nightshade, brannskada, fletcher...). The class is now essentially barbarian with less health and more armour, which is sometimes more desirable. Besides, several people have already paid 2000 gold for this class, rendering it almost impossible to give them their money back if the price were to be changed now. Each category has three classes for 500 gold and 3 for 2000, I don't see the need to change this, especially since skald is still a very useful class and those that know how to use speed to their advantage can do a lot of damage with it.  Another point, you're not supposed to throw your potions everywhere, you throw them directly at yourself or your teammates so that the other teams rarely get the buff. I really doubt you've put much thought into this post."
playmindcrack,31awa0,SteampunkMittens,-2,Fri Apr 3 12:40:39 2015 UTC,"I am not complaining about the other classes because I paid 2000 gold for them and they did not get a mega nerf. I'm talking about Skald because it did get nerfed quite a bit and it was never broken, it was supposed to have speed 3.  I never said that you should give back the difference of gold between the old price and new price. I don't want the price to change, just should have never changed Skald's abilities.   Of course you shouldn't spam pots everywhere! But who's gonna take the time to go in a private little team huddle and splash a little speed that is about the same as sprint jumping.  If you want a little speed go pay for a warmask. A lot cheaper."
playmindcrack,31awa0,SteampunkMittens,7,Fri Apr 3 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"Warmask and speed I stack. The speed potions still give you a significant boost, making it possible to strafe with similar speeds to barbarian and catch scouts more easily.  And did you honestly never realise that speed III was overpowered? About a month after the game came out (idk if you played then) almost all the top people on the Lords board played skald, including myself. It just wasn't fun for anybody, speed III makes it impossible to fight with any other class. It was absolutely ''Broken'' or unbalanced, because nobody ever wanted to fight it, and we even had an agreement between everybody that used to play it that we would no longer use it so that the game could be enjoyable for everyone else. All classes should be balanced around one another, none ought to be too powerful."
playmindcrack,31awa0,Ekketlol,5,Fri Apr 3 14:20:36 2015 UTC,Skald was broken. 60% speed to anyone on your team for up to 30 seconds.
playmindcrack,31awa0,SSBBguys,2,Fri Apr 3 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"I do agree, it should stay at 3, but maybe should have a lower tier speed effect."
playmindcrack,31awa0,SteampunkMittens,3,Fri Apr 3 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, what do you think should stay at 3?"
playmindcrack,31awa0,SSBBguys,2,Fri Apr 3 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"The speed is a little bothersome for scouts imo. Also, because of the fact that skalds are harder to kill with speed 3, limiting the pots to 3 would make skalds less op."
playmindcrack,31awa0,SteampunkMittens,3,Fri Apr 3 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"There's still 10 potions, the speed is reduced to I instead of III."

playmindcrack,311jeh,Ekketlol,3,Wed Apr 1 11:02:14 2015 UTC,"I came prepared.   I did some looking around on the PlayMindcrack website and looked through the change log, then I saw this:    Platform re-added, every time you get a barrier it has a 25% chance of spawning in as a barrier.   Isn’t the barrier in bold supposed to be Platform? I did some testing and I couldn’t find any difference between Flame 1 and Flame 3, my question then is why does “Brannskada” have Flame 3 on the bow? With the addition of the new camelot map, the map rotation seems biased towards the old map. This is because the old map has 3 variations compared to the new one which only has 1. Wouldn’t it be possible to have a 50% chance of having either map? (½ chance of Regorian Citadel, ⅙ chance of Desert Heat, ⅙ chance of Midnight Storm, ⅙ chance of Daylight Frontiers)  Is there a good reason there is a piece of the window missing? Waiting for a game is boring, that is why there is parkour in new lobbies such as Blackbeard and the new Camelot map. But when it comes to the old Camelot lobby there is a lack of time-wasting activities. One solution would be to replace the old lobby with the new one. Another solution, which I would like more, would be to add parkour in the current lobby. One thing to think about when building parkour though is to make the beginning of it easier than the rest, as this will separate the good traceurs from the great traceurs. (apparently you don’t say parkourers)"

playmindcrack,30v8wu,gyroninja,3,Tue Mar 31 00:05:23 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I guess the problem is the site tool I used to edit my skin didn't have a hat layer... so I guess it just decided to be all black instead.  I think I fixed it but not sure.

playmindcrack,30nlmr,Tetrixxx,0,Sun Mar 29 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"""You are allowed to charge players to access your server So long as the fee is the same for all players, you are allowed to charge for access to your server. You are not allowed to split your playerbase into paying, and non-paying users, nor can you restrict gameplay elements to different tiers of player.  Basically, if you’re charging for access to your server, you are selling a “ticket” and there can only be one type of ticket, regardless of how much people are willing to spend.""   The only loophole I can think of is the fact that you must join a separate server to access UHC. Either way, as an unpaid player, I find it a little disappointing. I paid the first month the server was released just to play UHC, and then got another month after #FTK. I just really want to play PlayMindcrack UHC :("

playmindcrack,30nlmr,Sigils,8,Sun Mar 29 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"The new EULA does forbid preventing access to different parts of the server to players based on whether or not they are are patrons/VIPS etc. However, their definition of a server is as follows:   What counts as a server? Are proxies one big server, or lots of smaller ones?  A server is something a user connects to with their client. The user is on a different server when they leave one and manually join another (in the multiplayer screen). Virtual servers and proxies make no difference; to the client it’s the same server.   Therefore, by their definition of a ""server"" the UHC server is a completely separate server from PMC. The only way for players to access it in this closed beta is to disconnect from the normal playmindcrack IP and connect to a new one. This makes it EULA compliant."

playmindcrack,30nlmr,WesWilson,-4,Sun Mar 29 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mentioned that before, but is a loophole really the correct way of addressing it?"
playmindcrack,30nlmr,WesWilson,14,Sun Mar 29 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"This is not a loophole.  This is exactly the circumstances that Mojang considered when admitting the patron-only servers were acceptable.  What is it that makes you think this is a ""loophole""?"
playmindcrack,30nlmr,wwarcher,-1,Sun Mar 29 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misinterpreted what Mojang meant. I thought by server they meant the entire minigame server, not the individual games."
playmindcrack,30nlmr,Sigils,6,Sun Mar 29 02:20:26 2015 UTC,"Server is defined as the address you enter into the client to reach your destination.  There is no single server on any major multiplayer service.  They are bungeed together, chained together, in a manner that allows people to freely move from one machine to another.  Mojang defines a single server as one that is reached via an DNS that you put into the client to reach it."
playmindcrack,30nlmr,PickShark,-5,Sun Mar 29 02:27:13 2015 UTC,I know
playmindcrack,30nlmr,frankenztien234,5,Sun Mar 29 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"How would you propose dealing with the matter in a way that doesn't involve this ""loophole"",  but still makes sense from a buisness standpoint?"
playmindcrack,30nlmr,TheDrCreeps,0,Sun Mar 29 01:10:10 2015 UTC,Release it when it's been fully developed or open it to everyone?
playmindcrack,30nlmr,PickShark,7,Sun Mar 29 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree that that is a loophole.  That is actually the system Mojang wanted/expected to have happen with their rules. You are allowed to charge for access to a server. From a technical standpoint, when we move you from a lobby to a minigame, that is actually moving you to a new server. They just wanted there to be a more clear distinction on when you were joining a new server than most players are aware of.  That's why that rule exists.   I can appreciate you wanting to play and it won't be Patron beta forever. But we also needed to have a lot of players come play help us get it ready for a full launch so this made sense to do it.  Gotta pay the bills somehow."
playmindcrack,30nlmr,Kreamator,0,Sun Mar 29 01:49:31 2015 UTC,well they could give you the direct ip for the uhc lobby and its definitely different than the other direct IPs. the server is only joinable if you have paid access for it as it kicks you if you have not which would seem to meet all the requirements.
playmindcrack,30nlmr,WesWilson,3,Sun Mar 29 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, you cannot charge players for in-game items, hence ""pay-to-win"" which gives players an unfair advantage. However, Mojang has allowed the use of ""pay-to-play"", which is making a service available with a small fee, like gaining access to a server with a ""subscription"". Most servers may do this monthly, yearly or quarterly (every 1/4th of a year).   The EULA states that it's acceptable to have Donator-Only servers with more features than the regular. By technicality, the UHC servers are seperated from the rest of PMC and can be considered a branch of the server itself, without breaching the EULA.   Hope this breaks it down for you!"
playmindcrack,30nlmr,wwarcher,3,Sun Mar 29 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"anyway, who cares about EULA? there are a lot, and I mean A LOT of servers who don't even know what EULA is, and mojang isn't doing anything about it. only the sensible, proper server who isn't trying to scam 10$ out of 5 years old keeps EULA."
playmindcrack,30nlmr,Sigils,4,Sun Mar 29 12:45:32 2015 UTC,The simple solution here is to buy a month of patron and enjoy access to uhc.playmindcrack.com as well as helping us get to the bonus weekend we're 98% of the way to. Uhc is currently its own server and could very easily have been set up to kick you entirely instead of redirecting you to playmindcrack. There is absolutely a difference in a server and a server network and as such uhc is completely EULA compliant.
playmindcrack,30nlmr,wwarcher,2,Sun Mar 29 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"The way it works is that you ARE allowed to sell ""Tickets""/Acess to your server to people, BUT everyone who joins that server must have paid it or have some form of ownership of the server."
playmindcrack,30kbdj,Gunner857,2,Sat Mar 28 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a server sided thing making someone lag for a bit sometimes making them time out. This happens every so often in a game and it only happens to certain people every time."

We understand that some people have a hard time being able to run Minecraft without the graphics optimization optifine provides. Please note that this doesn't give you permission to use similar mods, and if you are caught with any other mod you will be banned.   As for the zoom-function that optifine provides, I personally think that people with the ability to zoom will have advantages over others who can't in gamemodes like, MSG or UHC. Being able to spot someone from far away, way before they see you is a great advantage I feel. Unfortunately, there is no way to prohibit anyone from using it, as it is one of the core functions of Optifine."

This is good, we love feedback, helps with making sure we're doing the right thing!   The problem is that it went a little overboard (my opinion) and people started arguing, taking sides, and putting blame on each other. It wasn't a single person, it wasn't a group of people, it was starting to be a 2 sided argument with people picking sides. I didn't want it escalating further and people to start saying things they might regret, on both sides of the argument.  I wasn't trying to censor discussion, or try and stamp out community thoughts. In fact, after the 2nd post, i took all the feedback and spent 6 hours in front of my computer trying to see how we can improve moderation, and i basically don't have a weekend anymore because of that."
playmindcrack,2zufwh,croswat,3,Sat Mar 21 22:49:06 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the time spend analyzing feedback, and I'm sorry my post apparently started an argument of sorts. But in my post specifically, there was very little arguing going on, and more just discussing feelings about the report system. Although you weren't trying to censor discussion, and more looking to avoid further confrontation, discussion about something the community cares about was censored, and that sucks :/"
playmindcrack,2zufwh,BigBrownBox,9,Sun Mar 22 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. I guess my problem is mostly around the deletion of the second thread. You said yourself that you found the discussion helpful (and it's really great to hear you listening to the concerns of the community) but then why delete it? I honestly saw no harmful comments besides maybe one person, but even then if they get out of control you can just warn them/delete their comments if they start disrespecting people.  I understand what you're trying to say with the two-sides argument, but honestly the bases of most arguments consist of two or more sides. As long as they aren't harassing one another I feel like it should be allowed. If someone starts spouting nonsense the community can usually take care of the post through downvoting.  And again, thanks for taking the time to explain. I'm sure the community really appreciates the effort you put into making the server a better place."

Once you have got the ticket for the UHC you can do /lobby  to return to the regular PMC lobby and play other games while waiting. When the UHC game is ready you will see a message in chat asking if you still want  to play the UHC.   You can click on the text in the chat that says “Yes” and you will be teleported to the game. If you select “No” you will be removed from the queue and the price of your ticket will be refunded.

playmindcrack,2znld4,PhD_Phil,5,Fri Mar 20 04:28:51 2015 UTC,Being in the same lobby to create the party is no problem since you can just /goto each other if you're friends and how complicated can it be to not decline the invite? you get instructions how to do it when you get invited. The system is fine as it is.
playmindcrack,2znld4,Sanjisama,5,Fri Mar 20 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"I can see why it's frustrating, given that Missile Wars brought a lot of new people to the server just to play it. Suppose a group of four people logs into PMC and it's the first time any of them have been there, and they just want to play a game of MW together. They're put in different lobbies (this in itself has the potential to confuse them anyway if they're not very familiar with minigames servers) so they need to use the friends system to get to the same lobby. But they're new and they don't know about the friends system, so hopefully they'll end up looking at the website and find the commands page which will point them in the right direction. Then they need to add each other as friends and /goto each other, at which point they have to use the MW party system which is undeniably imperfect.  I can definitely see why people would be frustrated as, after all that, they get sent to another lobby to wait for their game."

There doesn't seem to be a big difference between winning and dying late, making it so you just need to play a bunch of big games and survive. Kills matter a little, but not that much.  If it is mainly based on how long you survive in a game, people will find out and just camp every game.   Oh are there going to be any rules on camping late game?

We had a plugin that tried to detect your timezone based off of your internet connection to tell you when the next UHC was. However if people had weird IP addresses or unusual ISP behavior it might display the wrong timezone. For you in specific it just confused it somehow and made it think there was no game currently for you somehow. Not entirely sure to be honest. You were the only reported case.

playmindcrack,2z23dq,croswat,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:51:58 2015 UTC,It's not actually real TNT. It's a rendering glitch from a tool that prevents X-Ray exploits.

playmindcrack,2z23dq,TJtheObscure,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:28:02 2015 UTC,I'm really getting sick of running into to the people with the most stuff...
playmindcrack,2z23dq,BlueCyann,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Well that was disappointing. I just tried to play my first game, and an hour or so in all of a sudden was unable to dig or place blocks.  It was like I wasn't in the game (when ""digging"" the pick would only swing once, and made no sound), except that mobs still moved and I was still able to kill them and pick up exp, etc.  I disconnected to see if that would help, and can't figure out how to get back in so I guess I'm done. :(  Help?  With the issue, and also on how to rejoin a game after a disconnect?  I had (almost) full health, tons of gold, and after a hard time finding caves only lacked lapis to enchant. :(  It happened (or at least I noticed it) immediately after a border warning that turned my screen red (though I was over 100 blocks from where it said it would end up by the time I logged out).  I don't know if that's related."
playmindcrack,2z23dq,TJtheObscure,2,Mon Mar 16 06:50:51 2015 UTC,Hmm hard to know what caused it. If it was just you might have been some weird network traffic or something on your internet connection to us. The reconnect mechanic should be automatic but has a 60 second timeout.  We will be extending that in future updates.
playmindcrack,2z23dq,gyroninja,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"I was definitely trying to reconnect within 60 seconds, unless somehow the game was already counting me as disconnected before I hit the button.  (As mentioned I could still fight mobs and also chat, though, so ...?)  Should reconnecting be as simple as clicking on the UHC beta server again?  Because that's what I did.  Or am I missing something?"
playmindcrack,2z23dq,TJtheObscure,2,Mon Mar 16 07:08:10 2015 UTC,It should be that simple. The reconnect feature isn't fully developed yet so may just have straight not worked for you.  That's on the to-do for this week.
playmindcrack,2z23dq,TJtheObscure,2,Mon Mar 16 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"I said it below, but sometimes you have to keep trying to relog to get back in the game. Sometimes it takes you to the lobby instead for some reason. I logged out and in about 4 times before I finally got back in the game."
playmindcrack,2z23dq,mythbustman,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for mentioning this.  I tried twice the time I was talking about, but didn't continue after that.  Also, it's since become apparent that what happened to me was the same ""red glow bug""/""border glitch"" thing that's been mentioned elsewhere.  At least if it happens again I know what it is."
playmindcrack,2z23dq,gyroninja,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:37:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I'm imagining things, but I think hunger might be depleting even when standing still. This may only happen if you've taken damage. I took a break with on heart missing and full hunger and came back to it down 1 1/2 haunches. Again, may be my imagination."
playmindcrack,2z23dq,TJtheObscure,3,Mon Mar 16 16:17:13 2015 UTC,I can confirm this. Minecraft consumes saturation (which in turn consumes hunger) when trying to heal you. We are merely just cancelling the healing. I'll figure out a better way of making healing not take away saturation.

Also, I learned that when you relog and end up in the lobby  it may not be the end. The same red glow bug happened again and rather than give up when I saw I was in the lobby I kept trying to reconnect and eventually got back on."
playmindcrack,2z23dq,croswat,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:36:24 2015 UTC,I have a question about reloging and afking for a short period of time; Is there a timer for reloging from a crash or glitch? and is afking for a short time allowed?
playmindcrack,2z23dq,Nilba,2,Tue Mar 17 17:20:29 2015 UTC,"There is a timer on reloging.  Its currently set to a couple minutes. Not sure if it is 3 or 5.  And I think you can AFK, but the world border might find you. I don't think there is a current AFK kick mechanic, but I could be wrong on that. Haven't checked recently."

I was just killed by the worldborder and I know I'm not the first. The 5:00 game had the queue reset so I didn't get to play, and I was really looking forward to this 8:00 game. 15 minutes in I'm in my stairwell, someone dies, and the border just engulfs me. I know as a player I can check my coordinates, I can stay up on the surface to see where the border is, or I could even make sure I'm close to the center of the map before I head under to cave. But that defeats the purpose of the 1000x1000 map, forces players to have f3 open and read the chat constantly, and/or play differently than they would by moving closer to the center. Is it possible to have it based on a timer instead? Or have better warnings? Maybe slow it down? Right now it seems to move really fast, especially if you're in a stairwell underground and can't move very well. I mean, I had no way to even attempt to escape.   The border is meant to force conflict, but right now it's ending it before it can begin."

Are there any plans for buying/unlocking upgrades?   The cosmetic shop will be out soon (maybe a day or 2?) where you get to buy kill effects (think mindcrack logo, vortexes, and things like that) that show up  when you kill others. There is no plans right now to sell anything that affects gameplay.   Is strip mining allowed or bannable?   we're not moderating for strip mining. Caving is quicker and more fun anyway."
playmindcrack,2ydzjv,croswat,13,Mon Mar 9 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"I very much disagree about strip mining.  For one thing, it's not simply a matter of speed; it's also a matter of safety and probabilities.  The strip miner can get himself diamond armor pretty much every time out and with no risk of losing health whatsoever. (Heck, you can even stay shifted 95% of the time and so not expose yourself to other players the way you normally would, never mind mobs.)  The caver takes infinitely more risks, and also runs the chance of covering tons of cave and finding nothing.  And I'm not at all convinced that ""caving is quicker"".  In my experience, it's not.  I'm very concerned you've set up a system where the only way to compete is to suck all the fun out of the game for yourself and strip mine.  People aren't making videos here; they'll be trying to win, so they will do it.    As someone who sucks at pvp but absolutely loves caving (and is quite good at it), that's taken me from being super excited about this UHC to pretty much not wanting to play at all.  I wish you would reconsider.  Why not use some kind of plug-in that removes all ore veins that don't touch air somewhere?  People could strip mine to their heart's content, but they'd get almost nothing, and you wouldn't have to police it."

playmindcrack,2ydzjv,TitaniumForce,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"I see your point and I'm sure everybody else does too, but you really don't want to have this UHC be over-moderated with thousands of rules that can easily be broken. There will always be people stripmining and later on, when you're keeping yourself restricted by the rules, others will have an advantage over you by stripmining anyways (it is impossible to keep moderating every player in every single UHC game at all time). That plus what do you define as stripmining. What if someone thought they heard a cave or saw a nametag in the far distance and it turns out they were wrong, it'd be pretty annoying to get kicked for that don't you think? That's just my point of view, I've seen it before, many rules give unfair players many unfair advantages, so it's better to allow everyone to do it."
playmindcrack,2ydzjv,Jadja-,8,Mon Mar 9 10:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for thousands and rules and never will.  I'm asking for THE rule, IMO, the one thing that separates a proper game of UHC from an hour of drudgery followed by everybody-in-full-diamond-and-at-full-health boring-ass PVP.  If you allow people to strip mine, people will be forced to strip mine in order to compete (whether they'd otherwise prefer to or not).  It ruins the game.  I'm someone who's been interested in UHC for a long time.  I am a GOOD caver (think Anderzel in style and results), and I very much enjoy it.  The pvp aspect and intimidation factor of the community have kept me from playing at /r/ultrahardcore even though I've wanted to.  I've been looking forward to PMC UHC as a less intimidating way to play, on a site I like, but if strip-mining is going to be allowed, I don't know.  It sucks the air right out of the room for me.  I think this is a huge mistake.  With spectator mode, strip-mining actually could be enforced just the same as teaming is (if not better -- a momentary interchange between teammates, using each other's enchanting table for instance, could be easily missed; but nobody spectating is going to miss a 100 block tunnel at y11).  Sound sources and other players can be easily seen in spectator mode, because walls don't block your view. And anything borderline (poke holes, digging around a lava lake when you may or may not actually possess a water bucket, digging out the one-block high areas around lava, etc) can just be ignored.  It's not the incidental stuff that threatens the game.  It's the ""strip-mine or lose"" replacement of risky caving and risky player encounters that threatens the game.  So it's not something that can't be policed.  But it doesn't even have to be.  Plug-ins exist, whether for 1.8 or not, that remove all ore veins that don't touch air anywhere.  If this could be implemented, then the mods don't have to do a single thing.  People can dig through stone to their heart's content.  It just won't get them anything.  (And if the next objection that's coming is ""but it's not vanilla!"", please don't.  The anti-pvp rule for the first day is not vanilla, and it's absolutely the right choice to have it that way.)"
playmindcrack,2ydzjv,BlueCyann,5,Mon Mar 9 11:54:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you entirely. Strip mining will be practically required to win in many cases, and completely sucks the fun out of uhc. I'm hoping the admins will change their minds after more beta testing and player input because strip mining sucks."
playmindcrack,2ydzjv,KKlobb,-4,Mon Mar 9 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"It cannot be controlled... you can install plugins to see who broke which block and to replace every ore that doesnt touch air to stone but this will just ruin the normal vanilla game. (by deleting some of the ores you would find via caves and adding extra stuff for the server to process). stripmining simply isnt as reportable as teaming, you're not gonna be able to know if someone got lucky with all his diamonds or if they just stripmined them all. Trust me, it's better if everyone is allowed to, people are still gonna do it without getting caught and it's just going to frustrate you even more."

I don't think that's how the plug-in I mentioned works (I believe it works on world generation.)  Even if I'm wrong about that, you can't just sit there and say ""strip mining isn't reportable"" when you have no reason to believe that and I've given reason to believe that any halfway competent mod in a 30 person game could find it out very easily.  Just switch players every couple of minutes, if you find anyone in a tunnel with no obvious reason to be there, warn 'em, and if you see it again, kick.  What's the problem?  You're inventing problems that don't exist.  Unless you want to strip mine yourself and are irritated someone's trying to take it away, I've seen no reason for your attachment to the idea."
playmindcrack,2ydzjv,BlueCyann,-3,Mon Mar 9 13:44:08 2015 UTC,"if a plugin would be able to see the difference between an ore block in the back part of a vein exposed to a cave and an ore block that is in a vein that is not exposed to a cave, then yes, definitely use it.   But the problem here is, even though it is said now that every game will be heavily moderated and the games in the following weeks most likely will be, there are going to be more games playing at the same time, there are only about 20 moderators, and it wont take very long till there will be games without them, they have lives. We'll have to resort to /reporting people are you simply cannot catch every stripminer that way.   I'm done discussing now, I did read ur arguments and i didn't mean to sound like i ignored you."

However the rules we'd read hadn't been adamant that this was kickable, and others had been doing it too. Thanks for telling us, I did end up killing 2 of my teammates. I'm really sorry, but as friends in a test game we wanted to last as long as possible, at least none of us won.  (Apologising on behalf of myself (Bin), Red, CC, Sanji, Spammo, Mike and Boba. The latter 2 not being in our call we started before the game, but wanted to be friendly.)  In the future I'll be sure to kill anybody I see on sight, whether they're my best friend, a mindcracker or somebody I've never met.  Looking forward to future games, no hard feelings anyone? :)"

The health indicator allows for targeted cleanup, but also adds a new element to the game. I like it.  I don't mind the damage potion change. The games go by so fast, it's not a big deal if you die to them, even cheaply. To survive all the time, you have to be next-level skill-wise. I like that. It gives people with less skill an opportunity to feel good about themselves, even if it wasn't a fair fight. But next-level pvpers will still come out on top 90% of the time."

The only thing I don't like about it is how S4 Nether Hub is really compact and if you don't get the right gear, you die instantly, and the water area in Nebris's base. I haven't played on Mhykol's base yet, so no thoughts on that. Though I am pretty salty with the removal of S2. In the entire year i've been on the server, I haven't noticed but 1 problem with the map... and that was the spawn where you couldn't escape the room... thats it. And I'm also annoyed that TNT will be removed from the game. That made S2 spawn different in a way, which it won't be anymore thanks to the removal of TNT >.> I get that TNT blows up rooms that were closed off, but if people get stuck in the holes then thats their own fault... And also S4 Spawn is laggy as hell. I go from a solid 60 fps to 10 on the map. If any map should be removed it should have been S4...   I talked about the Damage 2 Pots on another thread  The health indicator is nice. Its also a blessing for brawlers. Im good with it."
playmindcrack,2y7xj4,avenger1825,3,Sat Mar 7 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything said here. While it may annoy people at times, I see pots as one of the few aspects that sets MSG apart from other survival games, somewhat like how typical MCSG-like servers have fishing rods available in chests. They're one of the miniscule amount of things that makes MSG unique. Removing them entirely doesn't seem right. However, them being tier 2 at this point is just broken. The only possible solutions I can offer is to either nerf them back to tier 1 in order to make their main purpose knockback. OR to decrease the likelihood of them spawning in chest to the point where getting two or 3 in the same game is rare. I don't think having them in stacks is going to lead to a solution considering that you can restack them. That's just my opinion anyway.  Other than those few issues I have I'd like to say great job with the update so far and hopefully you can get all this potion stuff sorted out :3"
playmindcrack,2y7xj4,Tetrixxx,2,Sat Mar 7 10:48:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with that as well. When I played MSG when the update came out, I would be getting combos on someone, and then they would throw a harming 2 pot and get a direct hit since we were in a sword fight. The amount of damage it does is too OP. I am fine with them restacking harming 1 pots, or just making harming 1 pots spawn one at a time...but harming 2 is way too powerful."
playmindcrack,2y7xj4,PManning4Prez,3,Sat Mar 7 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"I think potions add a different element to PvP, and it forces us to think about more than just bows and swords. Its not like potions = automatic win.  With that said, I know a lot of members of the community don't like them, and for good reason. Yesterday I took a fully ironed and enchanted guy down to 8 health with one potion shot. That's 6 hearts. There's a point when something is so powerful strategy doesn't come into play. I had iron boots and a wooden sword and ended up winning the battle.   In order to satisfy all parties I vote for damage 1 potions that spawn rarely in stacks of one."
playmindcrack,2y7xj4,TJtheObscure,3,Sun Mar 8 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"I said this in another thread, but I'll say it here for the sake of it. Change it too DMG1 potions stacked in 2.   Being stacked in 2 means that you can only increase that stack number by 1 every 2 and 2 potions you find. Potspamming is just irrelevant now anyways and it was honestly what caused this change in my eyes. For those that whinged about it, it was NEVER as powerful as this, was it? Yeah, I REALLY don't think so.  It also goes back to being a defense item. Popping for 6 health right off the bat... just hurts obviously. It's like comparing a pistol shot to the foot & comparing a shotgun shell to the face. Hurts ALOT doesn't it?  Keeps one of the twists that this survival games has. It forces people to play out of their element. A game where PvP involves strategy AND skill instead of JUST skill is way more interesting.   My 2 cents. :)"

But no matter what anyone does, people will always have a problem with it. People say 4 Pots is OP, they change it to Damage 2 with 1 per stack and people say OP... So honestly removing the pots overall would be a solution. That would give everyone one less thing to complain about imo. TNT would be a good replacement to the damage pots. Thats what made Season 2 Spawn... season 2 spawn. I say replace pots with TNT in all maps..  But thats just me"

playmindcrack,2y7xj4,Ender_Sword,-2,Sun Mar 8 02:29:29 2015 UTC,I agree. You can be getting a combo on someone who is trying to clean you up then he turns around throws a damage II pot and you're dead. If you nerf it to I you can use it to escape.

playmindcrack,2y6tpt,PManning4Prez,-2,Sat Mar 7 09:03:00 2015 UTC,"I really wish they would remove them, and here is why...This is socialism. They have leveled the playing field. The people who aren't good at the game now can throw a pot at you that can take up to 6 hearts away. The have made the people who were good at the game irritated because we have worked very hard to get where we are skill wise, and now they put a pot in there that can make the bad players have a chance. It isn't like this in life (at least here in America)...If your boss gave everyone a share of the employee of the month award no one would try for it. The people who work very hard would be like, ""well screw this....why should I work very hard for something that will just be given to everyone..."" This is happening here. With these pots, the bad players are now on the same level as the good players. I live in fear of going to fight someone now, when before I would go and just wreck them because I knew I was better. The way I believe it should work is they should not make it a fair game. It doesn't work that way in sports...the good players rise to the top, and just like sports if the bad players watch and learn they can become better without having to cheat themselves with a loop hole. They should have to learn, and even if they never become the best so be it. You can be a gamer and not be good at the game, just like you can be an athlete and not be good at the sport. Do NOT level the playing field. Sure the chests are random, but one pot could ruin the game, and it should not be based off who can throw a potion at the right time, it should be based off skill."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,stefanloos,5,Sat Mar 7 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's better to give players that aren't that great in PvP a chance to win, so it's more fun for newer players. I think pots helped that and more team blood bath maps / games. This update might be really frustrating for the older sg players, but I'd rather see the server grow in player base."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,themanoftacos,3,Sat Mar 7 15:53:36 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that comparing this game to socialism is the best of comparisons that could be made...
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,jonnyboyUSA,2,Sat Mar 7 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"the problem here is that you're comparing real life... to a game. and why do not want to give everyone a chance? the new players would then get sad and frustrated that they have no way of winning(unless they start practicing techniques). it's called mindcrack survival games, not mindcrack meelee-skill games"
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,PManning4Prez,-5,Sat Mar 7 16:36:07 2015 UTC,I am not saying make it a melee only game. I am saying let the good people be good and the bad people be bad. It is their own fault if they aren't good at the game. Don't make the good players suffer from it.
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,laurenisabellax,8,Sat Mar 7 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"let the good people be good and the bad people be bad   Or let the bad people improve by having a chance...because people totally just came out of the womb being amazing at pvp..wasn't a learning process at all right? Unfortunately not everyone has the patience or time to get better and not get rekt every game by experienced players. I'd rather die to a new player with pots than continously die to the same person every game, but hey that's just me"
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,themanoftacos,3,Sat Mar 7 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"It is their own fault if they aren't good at the game   What you're saying doesn't make any sense as far as having a successful server. If you want to favor the game towards the ""good"" players, then any casual jimmy that hops onto the server and plays one round of SG will immediately hate it and never want to play there again. You are being extremely elitist and naive, and you clearly do not understand how game balance or maintaining a mildly-popular server based entirely on minigames works.   Honestly, if all you want is to be a ""good"" player and get lots of kills, you can go into a singleplayer world and spawn lots of zombies and kill them. The fact that the average player in SG has the ability to kill a so-called ""good"" player makes it more exciting, and ultimately makes people stay on the server.    I live in fear of going to fight someone now, when before I would go and just wreck them because I knew I was better   See, if this was the case, then nobody would want to play the game except for the top players. To give a real world example (obviously does not fit perfectly, like your example of socialism), your ideal situation would be a world where there is an extreme class divide, and an oligarchy. The entirety of the 'power' (read:kills and wins) would rest on the top players at the expense (read:death) of the 'commoner' average-ish players. Clearly this kind of thing would not be fun for the average player (the proletariat if you will), and unlike in the real world, they could actually escape this society, by simply leaving the server and never coming back.   Also, socialism in itself as a concept is not an inherently bad thing... it's just the fact that when carried out in real life, it usually can't work."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,PManning4Prez,-4,Sat Mar 7 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't feel that way about real life, I like capitalism in real life, but for MSG...I just want to be able to kill someone and only take around 3 hearts of damage...this was how it was for me before Harming 2...the old pots were much easier to dodge. But hey, everyone has their own opinion."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,Just_Gerald,3,Sat Mar 7 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"I just want to be able to kill someone and only take around 3 hearts of damage.   Yeah, everyone would love that. But that ain't reality, sometimes you kill a guy, sometimes you die. It's the game, the trick is balancing the game so that it works out to 50/50 for equal players. Feel free to practice and be better than 90% of players, that's the only way to achieve your goal.   If you want that, then you are practicing oppression as you want the kill handed to you on a silver platter with no thought to others."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,TheKid217,2,Sat Mar 7 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"...I'm sorry, but why are you comparing a GAME, to REAL LIFE?

They buffed them to the point where they somehow both got rid of their main purpose, knock back, while giving them enough power to dominate anything. Unfortunately they have made those who always say, ""pots don't take any skill"" to be absolutely correct. They have been buffed to the point in which they aren't even fun to use. The worst thing is that this will just make more people complain about them."

playmindcrack,2y6tpt,CopyCatJ,4,Sat Mar 7 01:21:15 2015 UTC,"Knockback to get a chain started they were the old pots, and they were great. But these new ones are basically why use a sword just throw another"
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,Dementio_,0,Sat Mar 7 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"I used to love using the stacked potions (cheap I know). But I think it was a good idea to what they changed it to. Now, I have to prioritize what I have on my hotbar. Do I want two damage pots taking up two slots, or do I want extra food in case I run low? That's just me."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,EhMeth,3,Sat Mar 7 02:10:56 2015 UTC,"Firstly, its as ""cheap"" using pots as it is as using a sword. Secondly, if you have something that can 2 shot someone of course you wont need food. This doesn't help prioritize hot bars, all this does is make pots op to the point they are no fun to even use."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,Dementio_,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:27:15 2015 UTC,"In order to two shot someone with level 2 pots requires you to get direct hits, which actually takes some level of skill. If you do the math, drinking a damage 2 pot takes 6 hearts. Health 2 does the same but heals you. Using splash two at your feet only gives you like 3 hearts, maybe 4 if you hit your head with it. So best case scenario with damage 2 pots is you hit them twice directly, assuming you have two of them, then finishing them off with the sword."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,EhMeth,3,Sat Mar 7 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge your first sentence is incorrect. Yes for 6 hearts of damage you need direct hits, but for 5 hearts you just need to get in the general area. Getting in that general area is not that difficult. Now assuming you have one you can get an easy half health down with one hit."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,PManning4Prez,-1,Sat Mar 7 03:19:12 2015 UTC,The only problem with this is that the skilled pvpers who like to melee are staying back in fear of losing half their health with one pot...MSG has basically become a game of bowing each other and then going in to see who can get the last shot with a pot...
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,TheKid217,3,Sat Mar 7 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"Um... no? I'm so tired of people saying ""THIS is how you have to play the game to fight/win"" because that ISN'T true. There's still a thing called dodging. There's baiting your opponent into throwing his potion, and running back before it lands. THERES DODGING. There's a shitton of things you can do. This is a PvP game where strategy still plays a factor as much as the so called skill you speak of.  Where is that skill when you talk about potions? Also, you speak as if a PvP game where bows are dominant is a BAD thing. Either that, or I'm just receiving it that way.  Final thing, being a skilled PvPer =/= skilled meele. Remember this please. :D  Edit - Tried to make it a little less rude. Sorry about that."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,PManning4Prez,5,Sat Mar 7 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"Not everyone is you. Dodging isn't as easy for others as it is for you. With the old pots I would dodge them and take around 1 heart of damage...with these I take around 3 hearts, and even when I get combos on the person after, they can still throw another harming 2 potion to cripple your chances of killing the person trying to clean up. If someone throws one of these pots and gets a direct hit, you will either die from that or be even lower when the cleaner comes to take your life. And not to mention a person can come into a fight between two people and throw the pot and kill them both. With the old pots this wasn't as likely, and they know when to throw it because of the health indicators."
playmindcrack,2y6tpt,jonnyboyUSA,3,Sat Mar 7 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"I used to be ok with damage potions, but now the feeling is gone, honestly I think they need to just be removed completely, it's not like it would hurt anything if they were gone. right now they are doing WAY more harm than good"

When you're buying a ticket, it'll say when the game is starting - as you can see here  -> Prices for UHC tickets have not been determined yet. If the games would be full all the times, the price will go up, if the games are not selling out, the price will go down.  -> When the game is about to start, you're online and you already purchased your ticket, you'll receive a message like this. You can pick YES or NO. If you pick YES, you'll join the UHC lobby, and then wait a few minutes for game to start. If you pick NO, your ticket will be deleted and you'll get your gold/silver back.  -> There should run month-long seasons. It will keep tracks of earned points you gain per game across the season and then there'll be a winner crowned at the end of every month. So the more of games you played, more players you killed = better place.  -> If you die, you'll get kicked from that game (of course).  -> There will be a world border. It's size will mostly depend on numbers of players in game. So when a player dies and leave, the world border will shrink.  -> And, you should be able to buy(?) some kill effects.

playmindcrack,2xlccy,SSBBguys,10,Tue Mar 3 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"I'm currently cheering for this to be put into rotation, glad to see how well it turned out from when I saw it last! :)  Great Job Camelot Nerds <3"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,WintersLocke,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I had no idea about this until this post..."
playmindcrack,2xlccy,SSBBguys,9,Tue Mar 3 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"You can ride pigs very smoothly on it, can confirm."
playmindcrack,2xlccy,wwarcher,4,Sun Mar 1 23:10:57 2015 UTC,0_0 all i can say. looks great
playmindcrack,2xlccy,PunchLineWasTaken,3,Sun Mar 1 20:23:37 2015 UTC,gdi punch do you just stare at the subreddit or something?
playmindcrack,2xlccy,TheRockinPuppy,4,Sun Mar 1 20:24:43 2015 UTC,Sanji... pls... but good job
playmindcrack,2xlccy,SSBBguys,3,Sun Mar 1 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"We've been working on this for a long time (way more than it should have taken), the reason we didn't speak up is we wanted to be secret :P"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,SSBBguys,2,Sun Mar 1 20:26:00 2015 UTC,Looks very cool tho... excited to play on it... if it does make it...
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Jadja-,6,Sun Mar 1 20:29:33 2015 UTC,So how is the extra land between the spawnpoints gonna be useful?
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Beluga09,3,Sun Mar 1 22:34:37 2015 UTC,Esthetics and to avoid roadfighters.
playmindcrack,2xlccy,DisarmingBaton5,3,Sun Mar 1 22:56:08 2015 UTC,Green spawn best spawn.
playmindcrack,2xlccy,TheRockinPuppy,2,Sun Mar 1 21:00:35 2015 UTC,Green team hype
playmindcrack,2xlccy,sirspammo,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:13:06 2015 UTC,Green team and spawn are amazing :P
playmindcrack,2xlccy,ArcaneWarrior303,3,Wed Mar 4 02:41:56 2015 UTC,agreed hype
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Phenrear,3,Sun Mar 1 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"Amazing!  Besides new maps, is Camelot getting any new features?"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,LightningPig30,3,Sun Mar 1 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"Well let's hope they fix assassin's invisibility too, but we have no idea."
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Yellowdash34,3,Mon Mar 2 00:33:48 2015 UTC,Wow that looks awesome!
playmindcrack,2xlccy,VintageDrummer1,3,Mon Mar 2 00:57:52 2015 UTC,Looks awesome! I hope the team accepts it.
playmindcrack,2xlccy,istisp,2,Mon Mar 2 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"This looks like a very cool map, hopefully it will make it into the rotation :)"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,bluu31,2,Sun Mar 1 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Which door will be open then? Given than in the current map the open door is the one opposite to the leading team, would that mean there would be two doors open at the same time? Also, how do you escape from the pit inside the castle?  Great job either way, if it gets chosen in the rotation I would go back to Camelot for sure!"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Phenrear,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"The outer doors will be open always, the doors in the next wall will change depending on the team."
playmindcrack,2xlccy,dolfly_,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"Additionally, there is now a staircase in the pit, so you are able to get out.  There have been updates to the old version that you found whilst sneaking around on Sanji's imgur profile. :P"
playmindcrack,2xlccy,TheRockinPuppy,2,Sun Mar 1 23:22:52 2015 UTC,Looking gr8 m8! Hoping it gets in the rotation. Just one problem. Who puts a chicken in green spawn? Merling forever!
playmindcrack,2xlccy,Talace,2,Mon Mar 2 02:47:52 2015 UTC,turns out all animals are going to be killed and not replaced so doesnt really matter chicken wise
playmindcrack,2xlccy,DisarmingBaton5,2,Mon Mar 2 03:08:49 2015 UTC,Looks cool! My only issue with it is that I don't really see anyone using the bridges between the outer wall and the inner wall unless you're an Assassin but invisibility is broken anyway.
playmindcrack,2xlccy,TheRockinPuppy,2,Tue Mar 3 02:32:13 2015 UTC,TALACE YOU'RE ALIVE?

playmindcrack,2xlccy,SSBBguys,1 point,Wed Mar 4 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"Roadfighting won't be a major problem anymore, I think. We'll see after it's been put in rotation."

playmindcrack,2xm225,gyroninja,2,Mon Mar 2 05:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well then, happy (late) Bday Gyro! I think we should have a PMC party for that. :P"

playmindcrack,2xm225,bluu31,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:01:33 2015 UTC,Nice!
playmindcrack,2xm225,robthebruce722,2,Fri Mar 6 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"This week, i've convinced my good friend to join me with some MW games, and its really a lot of fun. also, despite my horrible lag and the visual issues with 1.8.3, i've managed to win the game for my team a few times from actual skill instead of pure luck and panic!  also Warrior in Camelot because knock-back sword is fun with lag"
playmindcrack,2xm225,Imanota,2,Mon Mar 2 01:00:07 2015 UTC,It's really fun when you're a barb and the entire server is lagging. I got knocked over and past blue base by a warrior during lag just from the top of the keep.
playmindcrack,2xm225,Red_Wolfz,2,Wed Mar 4 05:34:26 2015 UTC,This week I schemed and made plans

playmindcrack,2xm225,NotYorkiePudding,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:12:23 2015 UTC,finally started playing blackbeard! turns out it's much more fun than I expected
