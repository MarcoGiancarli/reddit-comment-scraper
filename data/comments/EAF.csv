EAF,3b3yyf,ihurtpuppies,7,Thu Jun 25 21:33:06 2015 UTC,I laughed way too hard at this.
EAF,3b3yyf,joshuageralddaigle,3,Thu Jun 25 21:37:09 2015 UTC,Hah. Was almost like the next guy was trying to top the previous one.
EAF,3b3yyf,faxfinn,6,Thu Jun 25 20:02:02 2015 UTC,That's called a dap.  From what I've heard on NPR that were invented in the US military by African American soldiers and cooks to hold up the mess lines when there were bigots in line behind them.

EAF,3b3yyf,xelf,3,Thu Jun 25 22:37:23 2015 UTC,"Dap greeting:       Dap is a form of handshake and friendly gesture that has recently become popular in western cultures. The term is sometimes explained as dignity and pride, probably a backronym. According to one tale, it was introduced to and popularly used by African-American soldiers by Marine Captain John Dapolito during the Vietnam War. It appears to have been introduced to Western culture through film. For example, the 1936 movie Tarzan Escapes depicts the gesture.   Though it can refer to many kinds of greetings involving hand contact, dap is best known as a complicated routine of shakes, slaps, snaps, and other contact that must be known completely by both parties involved. Dap greetings sometimes include a pound hug. Elaborate examples of dap are observed as a pregame ritual performed by many teams in the National Basketball Association.  These choreographed actions are rarely televised and serve as a superstitious means of psychological preparation and team solidarity.    Image i - One of many variations of the Dap Greeting.
