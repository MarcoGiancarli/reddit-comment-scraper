bengals,3e110o,DonHutson,18,Tue Jul 21 03:16:21 2015 UTC,A pro bowl level player that makes stupid decisions. You might as well flip a coin with him.
bengals,3e110o,ZatwasDELICIOUS,8,Tue Jul 21 03:41:24 2015 UTC,He has a knack for killing good offensive drives. A stupid penalty or a dropped ball going for an extra yard. He lives too much inside of his own head. A lot of talent that seems to be wasted.
bengals,3e110o,bobcatbart,4,Tue Jul 21 11:13:58 2015 UTC,"He's an above average pass blocker and runs good routes for a TE. However, he has a tendency to hold the ball with one hand and fumble trying to go for extra yards. He commits some dumb penalties and is known for jumping offsides at the worst times. It has also been said that he may not have the best attitude or be a good teammate, though I have not seen any direct evidence of that.  If he's gonna sign for depth player money, that's one thing, but there is a reason he isn't a Bengal still."
bengals,3e110o,BTsBaboonFarm,4,Tue Jul 21 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"I think a change of scenery could help Gresham immensely, but he has a losers mentality and he lets it mess with his game. I feel like he has this persecution complex that he lets dictate his mindset, which is why he has lapses in focus and judgment, often at the worst times."
bengals,3e110o,form_an_opinion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"This.  Also, his effort is very inconsistent.  For most of a game he seems to be slowly going through the motions, then suddenly he makes a catch and drags half the defense an extra 3 yards to get the first down.  Then, just as your disappointment in him has turned to roaring cheers, he fumbles the ball away, negating all the good he just did.  Then he'll kill the next two drives with dumb penalties."
bengals,3e110o,ksvr,3,Wed Jul 22 13:23:49 2015 UTC,"He's probably going to be great for anyone who can give him the right coaching. He's built to succeed in this league, and he has the talent and heart to do it. He just makes too many mistakes when trying to extend the play."

Frankly, the Packers just don't bring in outside free agents that often, let alone any that have obvious on-field drawbacks, and as MrCharismatist noted, perhaps some locker room ones as well. And, the fact that they're in no hurry to dump Quarless speaks to how valuable they feel that experience is there. It's not an easy offense to grasp immediately."

bengals,3e110o,c-1000,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"Average blocker. Catches well, fumbles often. At least once per game he'll do something stupid and draw a 15 yard penalty that stalls a drive.  But, from last season...  https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/2p9tep/dave_lapham_just_threw_some_serious_shade_at/  Dave Lapham is a former Bengal and is one of the most jubilant backers of this team. He's very close with most of the O-Line.   For him to essentially call Gresham a quitter is astounding. It wouldn't happen unless he knew something from inside the locker room.  Personally, I'm glad he's gone, and wouldn't want him on the team at league minimum."

If he is on a contract of around 1 million I'd say he's great value"

bengals,3dxiec,dadiomcduck,43,Mon Jul 20 10:19:35 2015 UTC,"No.  Or, let me put this another way.  No.  Dalton is 40-22, 14k yards, with a 99:66 TD to INT ratio. When he's good, he's pretty damn good. When he's ""Bad Andy"" he's awful.  However what most people don't get is that particularly late in the season last year, ""Bad Andy"" was ""Not Quite as Good Andy"". He was playing with a pieced together offensive line, he was down a starting WR and a starting TE, and in most of those games he was playing with a defense that couldn't sack the opposing QB if they rushed 11.  Am I frustrated with Dalton? You bet. But in no way has he ever done anything that will lose him his job to a ""rookie"" coming off a shoulder injury. For such a thing to happen he would have to play a long string of games far worse than he's ever played.  This isn't a comment on Dalton, it's a comment on the way the team does business. The Brown Family and the coaching staff simply don't make those sort of calls.  Now, it's entirely possible that a Tom Brady/Drew Bledsoe situation occurs. Dalton gets hurt, McCarron comes in and lights the place up? Yes, in that case it's entirely possible Dalton could get ""Wally Pipped"".  No matter how frustrated you might be as a fan, Dalton hasn't ever played bad enough for stretches long enough to lose his job to McCarron."

Marvin & Mike Brown have never been fond of QB controversies like some places (Jets, Texans, Browns) and they arent changing any time soon. Even if Dalton suddenly sucks, they'll stick with him. If Dalton is playing like shit, our record will be shit. The shittier our record, the better our draft pick. The better our draft pick, the higher caliber replacement we can draft. Ive said once, Ill say it again. AJ McCarron is the same thing as Andy Dalton. Maybe when they draft someone, AJ gets a year to get a chance, but in todays NFL, people are starting right away. AJ McCarron is a perfect backup. If the starter gets hurt, AJ can step in, manage the game and as long as he doesnt fuck up, you still have a chance to win."

bengals,3dxiec,tissboom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Not this year, and not unless Dalton just really regresses. Last year was not a regression at all, people just do not realize that playing without your top 3 targets for a good portion of the season generally turns a QB's stats to shit. Dalton with a healthy WR corps will break 4000 yards and flirt with 30 TD's. McCarron's best bet to have an impact any time soon is for a serious injury to Dalton, and I hope that doesn't happen, at least not this year."
bengals,3dxiec,form_an_opinion,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"With a better run game and hopefully healthy targets, I could easily see Dalton put up some big numbers."
bengals,3dxiec,scottw5150,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think this is the make or break year for Andy as a franchise QB. I mean if he has a bad season or even just sort of average I could definitely see the team moving on or at least looking to get him cheaper so they can start looking for a replacement in the next few seasons. But I'm personally not sold as McCaron being an NFL starting QB. Like obviously he had a ton of success with Alabama but those teams were stacked with the best recruits in the game, so even if he wasn't a great QB himself the team was strong enough to be dynasty-esque. So I still am not convinced he didn't Trent dilfer us into drafting him. Not to mention unless we suddenly go super negative like 4-12 it's hard to replace a QB who has taken you to 4 or 5 straight playoff appearances especially when it wasn't too long ago that we hadn't been to the playoffs in over a decade."
bengals,3dxiec,SirLurksAlot6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"No, regardless we're going to see how AJ does next month in preseason."
bengals,3dxiec,excelon13,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"I say yes. While this may be an unpopular opinion based on the recent comments, let me explain a scenario that would in fact have McCarron dethroning Dalton.  Gilberry and countless other sources have said that AJ McCarron looks pheonomal this past OTA's. Now, granted, that doesn't mean a thing really, it's only practice, but this could play out to be something big. If AJ, a player who we haven't even gotten the chance to see play at NFL level yet, keeps his name up, and has a great pre-season, then things could get very interesting. Do you all remember Romo's superb preseason play thus warranting a look in the regular season and now he leads the Cowboys' franchise in most quarterback stats. My point is, if we're sittin at a 2-6 or 1-5, you can bet your balls that if AJ had a great preseason that it would be a commonly brought up topic as to when AJ will get the start. Let me say though, I highly doubt this will be the case, since we have the greatest roster in 20+ years with the team right now, but it isn't at all unrealistic. Andy has proved one thing indefinitely- he has no clutch. And with being the quarterback of Alabama, I feel like that is one trait that AJ possesses over Andy."

When he became fa the bengals didnt lift a finger to begin negotiations they let him walk without even a thought.

I'd rather have them sign him and trade Andy dalton or something if we had too. You guys really don't know the value he holds to this team..."
bengals,3dnm4i,Notapedo6969,4,Fri Jul 17 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"I'm fully expecting them to put out the big bucks. And if they don't, and he leaves, it will be a huge hit to this team. If they are going to make a run at a championship they have to have him."
bengals,3dnm4i,famik93,5,Fri Jul 17 22:24:27 2015 UTC,5 years ~70million.  I think that's reasonable considering what Dez and Thomas got.
bengals,3dnm4i,CrackaJakes,2,Fri Jul 17 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"It think brown will cheap out on guaranteed money, so the deal will end up being bigger to make up for the lack of guaranteed. Say 5 years, $74 million with $30 guaranteed with say $22 million cap hit the first year.   I don't think the bengals have a problem paying him, but they want flexibility ala Dalton deal."
bengals,3dnm4i,MrCharismatist,2,Sat Jul 18 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"Bengals have been preparing to pay the man top tier money since he walked into the league. There's zero chance he's anywhere but in stripes for 2016 and beyond.  Unless there's some question, like he finishes the season with a ruptured achilles, the deal will be bigger than Bryant and Thomas.  And as to people whining about Brown ""cheaping out"", the only oddity in this contract will be that the structure will front load as much of the cap hit as early as they can make fit. That's how they do business, wisely. They never leverage future salary caps to save this year.  They will walk away from other players to have the room to sign Green. That's a dead solid lock."
bengals,3dnm4i,form_an_opinion,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think they will sign him this year, front load as much of the deal into this season as possible, and finish with something around that 5/70 mark with about 40% guaranteed."
bengals,3dnm4i,HULKx,4,Sun Jul 19 13:10:05 2015 UTC,im hoping we can get him for 5 years 65 million with 30 million guaranteed.  otherwise i think we should franchise tag him for 2 years and see what happens.
bengals,3dnm4i,Wallsie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:43 2015 UTC,Two years on the franchise tag would defeat the purpose of just giving him a big deal to begin with.
bengals,3dnm4i,HULKx,2,Sun Jul 19 03:12:32 2015 UTC,The difference is having money tied up long term.  You tag him the first year to yet and pressure him into signing the team friendly deal and if it doesn't get worked out you franchise him again the next year and try again  He can just take the 30mil guaranteed and have a 5 year deal or get the 15 million guaranteed from being franchised and hope he doesn't get hurt.

bengals,3dkyfp,dadiomcduck,4,Fri Jul 17 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"Playing devil's advocate for a moment (I want them to keep AJ for the entirety of his long and productive career), It scares me to spend such a high percentage of the cap on one WR. As we've been seeing in recent seasons, CFB spread offenses have helped rookies transition to the NFL much quicker than they have before, but they're still as cheap as all the rest of the rookies. It's always dangerous to play the ""these two players can match the production of one good player"" game, but if we could land a quality free agent (T.Y. Hilton-esque) and draft a prospect in the early rounds, it may be in the long term interests of the team.   Ok, Devils Advocate aside, they really need to figure out how to keep that guy in Cincy without blowing up the team."

bengals,3dleyu,max_amillion,5,Fri Jul 17 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"We need to pay him, if we let him go everything crumbles. Without aj green a) Dalton doesn't have a concrete go to (duh) b) our other receivers shine off of Green. They wouldn't be as productive in any sense. And lastly and imo most important c) without Green defenses will not have to double cover anyone and instead stack the box which does three things 1) the running game will not be as productive 2)Eifert will have to block more due to the extra pressure and 3) Dalton will have to do more because of all of this. (which we all know how that usually works out)."
