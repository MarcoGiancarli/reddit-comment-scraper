How many films feature scenes of broad comedy and conclude with a genuine flight of terror from an unrelenting killer, and ends on a pessimistic note?"
ObscureMedia,3e224d,unclesporkums,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:02 2015 UTC,That is a fun movie.  I expect the remake to do alright.  Hard to screw it up.    But they did manage to screw up Wild Wild West.

ObscureMedia,3e0pne,psychsketch,3,Tue Jul 21 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Simply put, this is an interview between legendary Allen Ginsberg and Conan O'Brien. Interesting watch. Nothing deep or immensely insightful, but still some really good stuff. Also interesting to note that, while it may seem strange for Ginsberg to be talking to Conan on national TV, it isn't completely outlandish. As Conan himself has a degree in Literature from Harvard, and is fairly well versed in the subject. He even graduated his high school valedictorian, among many other things. Really smart guy."
ObscureMedia,3e0pne,Mr_A,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting how stiff the two hosts are at the beginning and how the audience doesn't make a peep, but by the end are roaring and cheering. Great video."
ObscureMedia,3e0pne,Reminisciences,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"I think it is because of the man being interviewed, Ginsberg. It isn't everyday that you get someone like him on National TV. They usually don't like people who hold radical beliefs on TV. The audience probably didn't know what to do when Ginsberg went on critiquing the Drug War and other things. As for Conan, like I said in the disclaimer, he is really into literature, so meeting someone like Ginsberg was probably a really big thing for him."
ObscureMedia,3e0pne,theoptionexplicit,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"Even if their questions present nothing new or profound, this really is like watching two worlds/eras collide. And oddly enough Ginsberg seems more in tune with the mainstream of today than the early 90s. Thanks for posting!"

Much like any other guest, they participate in activities. Nothing to bizarre, but nevertheless an interesting watch. Enjoy."

ObscureMedia,3duqix,RidleyScottTowels,21,Sun Jul 19 17:46:23 2015 UTC,"FROM YOUTUBE:    In 1998, Kmart had a limited test concept at selected stores called ""Kmart Solutions"". Keep in mind that back in 1998, very few people used the Internet for online purchases, let alone banking, and filing taxes.   This was before the dot com crash, and online retailing was in its infancy. Most people were also on dialup connections, where this was a high speed connection. Kmart at the time attempted to be ahead of the curve by providing touch screen terminals at the service desk (electronics department also had one terminal) to purchase selected high end appliances and electronics, as well as flowers and other items that Kmart did not carry within the store.    The system lasted maybe 2 years, as I recall. Many people browsed, but few actually purchased anything. I think this occurred for a number of reasons. First, it was uncommon to purchase something online from a store kiosk, and second, the selection was not very large, even though it had a variety of high ticket and unique items. But it was a good idea and concept, and you have to give Kmart credit for trying as I don't think Target, Wal-Mart or any other retailers were doing this sort of thing.    Here is the extracted video from a looping DVD which played on a projection television at the service desk. It's just under 6 minutes.    It really does bring you back to simpler times."

ObscureMedia,3duqix,flyawaysweetbird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:07:30 2015 UTC,Who knew K-Mart was so far ahead of their time.  They even have a touchscreen computer 1:20!
ObscureMedia,3duqix,5171984,2,Mon Jul 20 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, Sega was ahead of their time. K-Mart was just utilizing a technology in this video that had been around for a decade+ and had published papers on since the 60's."
ObscureMedia,3duqix,Peking_Meerschaum,6,Mon Jul 20 11:02:23 2015 UTC,"I live next to the only Kmart in NYC. It's really convenient, but I can't help but feel I'm taking a time machine back to the early 90's whenever I go inside. Everything from the floor tiles to the smell in the air feels twenty years out of date. Really I'm amazed it still exists...Kmart must be paying millions for that location every year."

ObscureMedia,3duqix,jbiresq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:24 2015 UTC,"Kmart was bought by Eddie Lampert, who then merged it with Sears. He has been running it into the ground ever since, basically asset-stripping it and extracting every little bit of cash he can. It'll be bankrupt and shuttered within five years. I'm sure that lease (I assume you mean the one in Astor Place) will be sold too."
ObscureMedia,3duqix,Peking_Meerschaum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"They have been there for so long though, I've wondered if they don't own the space; it seems like it would be hard to justify whatever the rent is otherwise. I understand that most of the retail spaces in NYC (Walgreens, Duane Reed, Bank of America, etc.) operate at a loss but are necessary to maintain a presence.   But I get the feeling Kmart is just clinging on to its Astor Place location, with some sense that losing its landmark NYC space would be admitting final defeat."
