Datsun,3dpejl,designty,3,Sat Jul 18 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"xpost from /r/projectcar  So I found a 280z where I live and the buyer is asking for $2500. The engine is not in the bay so I can't verify that the engine works. Neither can I verify that the transmission is any good.  Anyway, I noticed that there is rust but I have no sense of what it would cost to fix this car. I am inclined to work on the mechanical parts so rust repair, painting and fittings are not really things I enjoy. Having said that, I took quite a few pictures of the visible rust areas and above is the link.  Areas of rust: * Battery tray * Floor pans * Door jams * Frame?  I did not notice any rust on the fuel tank. There is one more issue with the car - the paint. I am not sure if it is clear in the pics but this car had a hideous paint job done on it. I believe it is Plastidip and without a primer or anything the paint is already peeling off. I am quite certain that I'll need the car repainted.  With these pics I went to a restoration/body shop and I was quoted 8-15K + whatever the paint costs. It also includes a media blast. If it costs that much, I am hesitant to proceed with the project. I am trying to get in touch with other body shops around here but at first blush this seems like a very expensive job.  My plan for any project car is to get it up and running, then worry about the interiors. I don't plan on doing any race track upgrades. My primary goal is to start working and learn about cars (read: mechanic parts)  I'd love to hear what project car thinks about this project and what you think would cost to get it in decent shape."

I'm worried about what he is hiding by removing the engine and plasti dipping the car.  280s are cool but I'd get him down to 1000(the price of the wheels/tires) or keep looking.
Datsun,3dpejl,Nicapizza,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:36:12 2015 UTC,I'll check to see. You are right one of the problem areas has been the paint although the seller did not paint it himself and bought it as painted. The problem is what it takes to get this car into a shape where I can wrench on it. The capital investment seems rather high and that is bothering me. The 280z is beckoning me.

Datsun,3dhdb5,spudmonkey2,4,Thu Jul 16 07:46:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the ECU BUT, I do know that the fuel pump is turned on by the AFM (Air Flow Meter) at the front of the intake, just in front of the throttle body. A good way to test and see if it is the AFM causing the issue is to remove the plastic cover from the side of the AFM, its held on by silicon and can be re-glued by silicon easily. Once the cover is off, you will see a circuit board. Attached to the board is a metal ""finger"" with a counterweight attached to it. You should be able to easily, and carefully, rotate the counterweight. This will move the ""finger"" along a path on the circuit board. Now for the test. Turn the car in the on position BUT, do not start it. Go to the AFM and rotate the counterweight. You should hear the fuel pump turn on. If you hear it whirring, then you know it works just fine. At this point, the problem is more than likely a plugged fuel filter and/or a dirty fuel tank. Its also a good idea to clean the contacts on the little path that the ""finger"" travels. I used rubbing alcohol.     If the pump isn't being turned on by the ECU, like the guy claims, there would be no way for it to idle.    Though, I could be very wrong as it could be a weird Datsun issue."
