zooeydeschanel,3533m7,johnw1988,1 point,Thu May 7 13:38:57 2015 UTC,Zooey was the only reason I watched that show for a while. I quite watching it after two seasons because it became less and less about her and more about her asshole roommates.

If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed""."
zooeydeschanel,25t2cw,l1ghtning,0,Sun May 18 19:00:09 2014 UTC,I thought it worked on a ratio system above a certain number of total votes.

zooeydeschanel,1sjhy4,GaProgMan,1 point,Tue Dec 10 20:41:13 2013 UTC,"I don't know. Look at her right eye (from our view point, the left)."
zooeydeschanel,1sjhy4,l1ghtning,2,Wed Dec 11 00:24:18 2013 UTC,"Hold up guy. I can assure you this is a normal feature of her iris. But sometimes (only recently?) she does wear contacts. However, she also has a lightly colored ridge on the outside of her iris that is very prominent. There would be no point wearing coloured contacts in this shoot since it was going to be heavily edited anyway. Case in point from the same shoot: http://i.imgur.com/b29EQci.jpg  Here is an example of the natural ridge on her iris up close: http://i.imgur.com/pPQ4akM.jpg  And another example of the iris ridge particularly on her right eye: http://i.imgur.com/bujkGSw.jpg  Here are examples of her actually wearing contacts:   http://i.imgur.com/HxZa3af.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/m9ooaDe.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/oaN5C4d.jpg  No contacts:  http://i.imgur.com/dFYdpb5.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/MzZmSRE.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Z99JQSV.jpg  Because of the appearance of the contacts, you can tell they are multifocal type too, because ""normal"" contacts do not vary in thickness across their surface."

If you're expecting a big epic portrayal of everything just as in the radio or books, you're going to be disappointed. Adams always treated every medium differently and this screenplay you can tell was at least a little bit 'simplified'. There's only so much you can do in 2 hours."
zooeydeschanel,1l7qin,GavinZac,2,Wed Aug 28 06:17:26 2013 UTC,"I fully agree. I think Zooey was terrific for trillian, and (I forget his name) was perfect for Arthur dent. I just think the direction was... Less than what Douglas Adams would've wanted. I honestly think if they'd brought another director on board, recast the same exact people, and just redid the script it would've been awesome!"

zooeydeschanel,1l7qin,Xaz1701,2,Sat Sep 7 03:16:06 2013 UTC,"Oh, the casting was fantastic. Every actor matched my idea, except maybe Ford - not because Mos Def is black, but because he's awesome in the wrong way. Too earnest. Not enough snark.  It was probably weird for a lot of readers too, to see Arthur ending up with Trillian. While Trillian is good for Arthur, and probably the most practical person in the universe, I think he'd do better with Fenchurch.   Now, casting for Fenchurch, that would be interesting. Evanna Lynch does the slightly mad thing quite well, but she's a hell of a lot young than the rest of the cast. http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33200000/2013-It-Don-t-Come-Easy-Behind-the-Scenes-evanna-lynch-33235701-1280-853.jpg"

It was their kickoff show, so they were working out some kinks, but that didn't change anything. Her voice is so much better live than it is on the albums. M. Ward's voice is great, too.

zooeydeschanel,1euitx,WhamBamMaam,3,Thu May 23 05:59:15 2013 UTC,Definitely more nostalgic and sounding like Volume Two. It is a really pleasant and entertaining. I'm loving many of the songs on this album.

zooeydeschanel,1abamt,cuppastuff,1 point,Fri Mar 15 04:06:51 2013 UTC,It looks like her.  I was thinking the same thing about #107.  Maybe it's the hair.  She definitely looks different without bangs.

I've always felt that you shouldn't badmouth your ex... it's just super disrespectful to everything you ever felt or said in the past. Unless it was an abusive relationship, you should try and remember it fondly.   Whenever my ex says something really mean about it me, it hurts. A LOT. No one should feel that way.   I think I'm naturally inclined to take his side, but still. I really like how his solo album was more positive..."

zooeydeschanel,17nwvg,igifedthat,4,Fri Feb 1 00:33:16 2013 UTC,This was her best episode and performance to date. She should always act in a bra and skirt with lots of sexual tension.

zooeydeschanel,17nwvg,defprd,1 point,Fri Feb 1 21:21:07 2013 UTC,O I get where you were coming from.  I still want to know what the OP meant.
zooeydeschanel,17l1s6,Sly_Devil,7,Wed Jan 30 21:13:07 2013 UTC,I think its probably because a big part of her image is that she doesn't (usually) show alot of skin or wear revealing clothing. Showing belly button instantly raises the level of sexiness of the outfit and tends to bring the appearance as a whole more in that direction. Since her sense of style is making classy/cute sexy without exposing everything it makes sense she's not showing bare midriff all the time.
zooeydeschanel,17l1s6,DeepRoot,2,Sat Feb 2 10:59:56 2013 UTC,"I agree w/ Sly_Devil and to add to that, her character on ""New Girl"" is s'posed to be a quirky, nerdy girl.  Quirky, nerdy girls wear bloomers where the ""sexy ones"" will don a thong."

zooeydeschanel,17jnvq,Sexy_Hamburgers,5,Wed Jan 30 17:50:28 2013 UTC,She usually keeps them fairly covered. But i think that makes the few times you get glimpses of them all the more special.

zooeydeschanel,169d3p,polewiki,4,Thu Jan 10 14:21:18 2013 UTC,"It seems to be a growing trend, especially with the popularity of New Girl; a lot of people just plain out claim to hate her, probably out of the same kind of hivemind mentality that leads to deaf people hating Justin Bieber."

zooeydeschanel,169d3p,jacbo,4,Thu Jan 10 16:13:53 2013 UTC,There are people who will hate anything if it's popular.
zooeydeschanel,169d3p,Nigelwethers,15,Thu Jan 10 16:23:46 2013 UTC,What in the actual fuck.  Why is a person (who's job it is to portray characterisations of people) being attacked for being themselves.  Is it because she defies everyone else's expectation and lives outside the framework others want her to?  There seems to be a very narrow definition of acceptable behaviour from the very groups preaching equality for all.
zooeydeschanel,169d3p,jacbo,2,Thu Jan 10 00:03:02 2013 UTC,"Presumably because she allows herself to continuously portray vapid characters which represent and reinforce a negative stereotype. In short, Mrs Deschanel has been typecast, and her type isn't the most flattering. The article is about her being critical of these same roles, which is commendable, and what the person writing the article is praising."
zooeydeschanel,169d3p,tokkio,1 point,Thu Jan 10 23:38:18 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure you understand what vapid really means or if you are projecting onto the roles you have seen her in.  The person seen on screen is not the actual person. Or do you think Anthony Hopkins likes to eat people?  Maybe the roles she chooses are intended to highlight the narcissistic + infantile aspects of some people and through a stripped down characterization make it easier to see the relative absurdness of the activity. Maybe she has to pay rent and is not ashamed to take on work that is not always going to be a masterpiece.  I'm not criticizing this article in particular, more the concept that a human being must act in a specific group of behaviors to be considered worthy of a particular label, then dismissing the value of that person because they are unable to be identified by that label.  I disagree that that she has been typecast, look at the number of roles available that represent non-cliched representations of females. They are few and far between."

zooeydeschanel,169d3p,RoninUnderground,3,Thu Jan 10 16:12:32 2013 UTC,In her defense?  There are certain parts of the modern feminist movement that do more harm than good for society.  I can only hope she's doing more good.

zooeydeschanel,14q0zd,moneyshift,2,Wed Dec 12 14:47:03 2012 UTC,Unfortunately it's not what gets headlines nowadays. I'm glad new girl is such a hit so many people can see being classy is still beautiful

Zooey started before Katy and I wish people would quit comparing them because they're totally different people. Yes, they look alike, but if you can't tell them apart then you need a bit more culture in your life."

zooeydeschanel,11t18c,justinbeatdown,2,Sat Oct 20 23:53:44 2012 UTC,This girl is 32 years old and she looks younger than me and I'm 25. This girl has had at least a little bit of botox. She doesn't have crows feet and we get that in our mid twenties. She might've been smart to have gotten 8 units (enough to rid of crows feet) in her twenties and decided to go overboard recently.
zooeydeschanel,11t18c,j907,1 point,Sat Jan 12 17:18:32 2013 UTC,Yeah not everyone has to get crow's feet at the same time... also she's always wearing makeup because she's an actress! We have no idea!
zooeydeschanel,11t18c,powpow2,1 point,Fri Jan 18 02:48:38 2013 UTC,The way to tell if someone has had botox is the eyebrows. I have a hard time watching cougar town because all I do is watch Courtney Cox's face. The outside part of the eyebrow will move a little but the inside part by the nose never moves.
zooeydeschanel,11t18c,mbright017,-8,Sun Oct 21 05:02:13 2012 UTC,"I'm not positive, but I highly doubt it. She is not the kind of person who would do that sort of thing. It may just be what you said, clever make-up. Besides, if you look at her other photos from recent events, she looks normal."
zooeydeschanel,11t18c,Evil_Steven,38,Sat Oct 20 18:37:52 2012 UTC,"I don't think we can say she's not the kind of person who would do that. First of all, we can get a sense of what she's like from interviews and such, but I doubt that you actually know her. Second, not only plastic-surgery obsessed Beverly Hills moms get Botox. She may have just been feeling self-conscious about visible signs of aging."
zooeydeschanel,11knwj,HonestTrap,69,Tue Oct 16 15:30:40 2012 UTC,"So there I was minding my own business, ordering a cup of coffee from this popular coffee joint downtown L.A. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a beautiful young lady sitting in the corner reading a book. Her hair was in her eyes and she was facing the corner, so at the time I couldn't really tell who it was. All I knew was that she was gorgeous, and I had to talk to her. I manned up, and approached her. As soon as she looked up, I realized it was Zooey. I could have sworn my heart stopped beating. I smiled and asked her what book she  was reading. Her- ""Raymond Chandler's The Lady in the Lake"". Me- ""Really? That is one of my favorite books of all time."" Her-""I've read it a million times, it's one of my favorites as well"" The conversation went great and although I was incredibly nervous, she was very easy to talk to. By the end of our conversation she gave me her number and told me to call her sometime. I walked out of the coffee shop with the biggest smile on my face. I then woke up and realized it was all a dream. That's the closest I have ever gotten.   Also, you should write her a letter. If she replies update us please!"

zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,JesseJaymz,2,Sun Jul 29 22:56:55 2012 UTC,Thank you for suffering through the show to get to these so I didn't have to!
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,Kieo,7,Mon Jul 30 02:56:49 2012 UTC,Could you enlighten me as to why you don't like the show? I actually like it and so do a couple of my friends so I'm just interested in what you don't like about it
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,JesseJaymz,10,Mon Jul 30 07:24:07 2012 UTC,"Of course. To me it is either written by a woman or definitely for women. Certain thing the guys say or do leave me saying ""OH MY GOD COME ON!! NO GUY WOULD DO/SAY THAT!"" I've tried watching it by myself and I've tried watching it with girlfriends, but Everytime I do I find myself like Bill Burr watching Oprah. I don't know I just find a good amount of the dialogue incredibly annoying and most of the characters aren't realistic to me. Not that it HAS to be, but it just doesn't work for me. i always find myself yelling at the t.v. a third of the way into an episode."
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,cb43569,5,Mon Jul 30 02:18:45 2012 UTC,"I personally think it falls back on cringe humour just a touch too often, but I do enjoy bits of it, so I've watched it anyway. Certainly whenever it gets too bad, I suffer through it for the sake of Zooey Deschanel. I'd also say that Nick is quite easily the most realistic male character of the lot, so I pay attention to what he's doing when silly things are going on elsewhere."
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,Kieo,1 point,Mon Jul 30 05:58:13 2012 UTC,"I think Schmidt's over the top but funny, when he passed out from getting a boner I was almost in tears from laughing. Honestly I think Winston's the weakest character in the show. But I agree Nick is probably one of the best characters and I find myself relating to him, probably why my friends say I'm the perfect mixture of him and Ted Mosby from HIMYM..."
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,cb43569,1 point,Mon Jul 30 06:06:19 2012 UTC,Sounds like the average male Redditor to me! (Although personally I wish I looked a little more like Ted Mosby and less like Nick...)
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,Kieo,5,Mon Jul 30 21:45:09 2012 UTC,"Interesting. I never really thought of it like that, though I do see most of the characters being rather unrealistic I still enjoy them. Though certain episodes can be hit or miss I still think it has some classic lines"
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,JesseJaymz,2,Tue Jul 31 05:32:25 2012 UTC,"well, hopefully i didn't point out one of those things that you ""can't forget"" now. don't wanna ruin the show for others, it's just not for me. she is quite hot in the show though."
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,Kieo,2,Tue Jul 31 09:11:51 2012 UTC,"No I doubt you affected my view on the show, I'm just always curious to hear why people feel a certain way about things especially things I like. Always good to hear different sides is what I think"
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,theodrixx,8,Mon Jul 30 17:30:38 2012 UTC,I've been trying to put my finger on why I hate this show so much for a while now. Thanks.
zooeydeschanel,xd0l0,JesseJaymz,4,Mon Jul 30 19:03:49 2012 UTC,"right??? haha, welcome. yeah, i REALLY want to like it cause she's so hot, but i can't. it brings out the asshole in me."
zooeydeschanel,x9x5l,kwitsch,20,Sat Jul 28 00:07:06 2012 UTC,"I've always looked at Zooey and thought she was gorgeous. But something about her made me refuse to think about her in a sexual way. I can only think about her in a more purely beautiful way. Zooey has always felt so much better than ""hot"" or ""sexy"" to me. So when I see photos like these it makes me wish that they hadn't been taken. Oh well, I just had to give my two cents. Have a nice day."
zooeydeschanel,x9x5l,forscienceobviously,5,Sat Jul 28 06:41:49 2012 UTC,"I feel the exact same way. I'm a huge fan of Zooey and everyone around me knows that. But I like her for her class and natural beauty, not for stuff like this."

zooeydeschanel,g1geo,micah1_8,1 point,Thu Mar 10 21:20:59 2011 UTC,Neat work there! Did you do the image manipulation yourself? It's a very nice effect. I might just load this up into an MPO file to view it on my 3DS later.
zooeydeschanel,g1geo,cb43569,1 point,Fri Mar 11 21:01:40 2011 UTC,"I used a gimp plugin called g'mic.  It has a bunch of settings built in, and there's a way to add your own custom filters to it.  Somebody created a 3d conversion filter and I was playing round with it.  You can do anaglyphs and cross--eye or magic eye with it.  It will guess and try to fully automate the conversion process, or you can paint your own depth map, which is what I did here."
zooeydeschanel,g1geo,cb43569,1 point,Sat Mar 12 08:02:04 2011 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out, I'm going to go hunt down that plugin now. I've loved Magic Eye pictures since I was a kid, but I recently got myself a Nintendo 3DS and I have to say, autostereoscopy adds a whole new level of enjoyment to viewing pictures."
zooeydeschanel,g1geo,yikesireddit,1 point,Sat Mar 12 14:48:37 2011 UTC,"You'll have to look in the discussions on flickr for the 3d plugin.  G'MIC does a whole host of effects, but the 3d conversion is one you have to add in.  It's a bit fiddly getting the 3d effect going, but it's worth the time and effort."
zooeydeschanel,g1geo,cb43569,1 point,Sat Mar 12 17:45:46 2011 UTC,That was really hard to do actually.  my eyes hurt.

zooeydeschanel,g1geo,TinyEarl,1 point,Sat Mar 12 08:04:59 2011 UTC,"Smaller ones are even worse for me, because then I have to pull myself closer to the screen, which hurts my eyes more. Is there a larger version?"
zooeydeschanel,fp4l2,TalekAetem,4,Sun Feb 20 20:38:07 2011 UTC,Am I the only one or does she look kinda weird as a blonde?
