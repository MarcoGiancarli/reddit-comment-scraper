composer,3e1gdi,pyrolight8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there. A nice little piece that I thought was begging for some development of all those ideas you've thrown out. I thought the intro would benefit greatly from the other 2 guitars coming in and complementing the solo guitar - especially around the ostinato at 11"", which would make a nice build. When the other guitars do eventually enter it's a good blend. Tonally, you have some nice ideas, but as I said before, it'd be great to develop them a bit more. The ending clearly leaves you hanging. Are you intending on developing it a bit more? Maybe further movements/parts?  I hope my suggestions are helpful. Keep it up!"
composer,3dz7os,Jamescalderoncomp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"I submitted this piece over a year ago under my other account, but wanted to repost it with this one to keep everything together.  This piece is an orchestral work based on the themes from the spanish guitar piece ""An Anonymous Romance."" I drew a lot of influence from Dvorak's symphonic writing, and also incorporated aspects of impressionism and minimalism.   This is the second of five pieces I'll be posting here to celebrate posting my website (the link is in the youtube description)."

composer,3duyhe,Palmer27,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"scoreexchange.com  A site for scores created using the Sibelius program. It's ok. I use it because I use Sibelius, but the majority of scores uploaded are various forms of transcriptions and arrangement, and not many original scores."
composer,3duyhe,LinusGustavsson,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"You might want to call it ""Can of Worms""!  The biggest problem in new music is getting paid for the hours of work you do.  There is a difficult balancing act between education and earning a living.  You have to ask yourself would you want to earn nothing from your life work to 'educate' people about your own music?  Not many would say 'yes'.  You just have to find the people who will say 'yes'."
composer,3ds2wd,Ze77en,4,Sat Jul 18 22:32:16 2015 UTC,"Two things.  First off, if you're going for the classical style, you need to let your music breath. Don't be afraid of silence, or space. Because of the lack of space between your ideas, this plays like a bunch of variations tacked on to each other. Quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes everywhere!  Secondly, and partially related to the first critique, your piece never grows. Practically from the start, it's full force, all mid and upper register, full speed ahead. Of course this will be partially alleviated by adding dynamics, but that's a bandaid.  If you were to draw a line on a paper to mimic the power of this piece over the entire 5 minutes, it'd be a pretty flat line.  Ask yourself, what does this music say? What's the emotion throughout the piece?  Keep it up!"
composer,3ds2wd,Hysteria-GT,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Now that you point it out, I definitely see what you're saying about the lack of silence. The piece doesn't really slow down at any point, and I will attempt to fix this. What exactly did you have in mind, though? Are you thinking more areas of complete silence, or perhaps slower rhythms, using more quarter/half notes and fewer eighth/sixteenth notes? I don't suppose you could provide a specific example of a spot you think could use some more space/silence? Either way, thanks for the feedback!"
composer,3ds2wd,Hysteria-GT,3,Sun Jul 19 06:27:08 2015 UTC,"While I can't give any specific examples, basically all of that you said could assist in improving the piece.  It's less of a technical critique, and more of an overall musical concept that great music nearly always follows. There's nothing freakier than writing silence in a piece (we are composers, it's our job to make noise!), and yet its a tool that provides more for a musical thought than any chord, melody, etc ever could.  edit: A good way to think of where is to think of your periods (groups of phrases) as sentences. The majority of your sentences currently end in commas. Give them periods (authentic cadences, and some space), give them question marks (deceptive cadences are good for this), give them ellipses (like any angry SO ending every text in dot dot dot...) which may be an elongation of the dominant, or whatever other technique you enjoy."
composer,3ds2wd,Barcelona_City_Hobo,3,Sun Jul 19 14:37:39 2015 UTC,"I concur with /u/Hysteria-GT and /u/porcos3, and I'd like to add a few things.   First, you need to improve your harmonic knowledge, the reason why the piece seems not to go anywhere, nor create tension is in part because the harmony doesn't lead it towards any dramtic modulation or cadence. One of the several mistakes would be not ending the whole piece nor the exposition in perfect cadences. There are also several chords without the third and bare fourths on the left hand.  Also, m.19-22 confuse me. Do you consider it still part of the transition? Transitions end in dominant prolongations almost all the time (either of the home or secondary key), to create expectation for the 2nd theme. However, after reaching the G major chord (dominant of C), you start a passage on a D-pedal. You should choose one or the other, and make this junction more like a culmination of what came before.  I'd recommend reading something like Piston's Harmony from end to end. You can have it from my library.  The rest of problems relating to structure and direction are addressed in Caplin's book, the bible for writing classical sonatas.  On the other hand, I see you willing to take advice and listen everybody, which is extremely very positive and rare to find (I'm more used to deluded n00bs who think they are geniuses). I wish you good luck."

composer,3ds2wd,porcos3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"I think its alright. A few times though, your parts move incorrectly; a leading tone is doubled, and some parts move in octaves. These are not many though, and sometimes it could be argued that it is simply pianistic writing, although at other times I wouldn't say so, and in those cases it is against the style you are trying to emulate.  I have to concur with Hysteria-GT: at times your piece stumbles with itself, it needs to breath, pace itself, and be more clear. For example, when you reach the dominant, I am not really sure which your second theme/subject is. At the end of the recapitulation, it feels as if the music should have ended, but it keeps running through what I think it is supposed to be a coda. If what you are attempting is to write is ""textbook"" Classical style, clarity of form is what you should strive for."
composer,3ds2wd,porcos3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I don't quite understand what you mean about the parts moving incorrectly. Could you provide a measure number or something to point it out?  As for the secondary theme, it is driven by the dotted quarter, eighth note motive in the right hand and the ascending thirds starting on an off beat in the left hand. A new triplet motive is also introduced here. And yes, that is the coda that comes after the recapitulation, starting at measure 91. Do you think I should label it appropriately?"
composer,3ds2wd,jesus_can_save_you,2,Sun Jul 19 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"For example: in Bar 4, you have the chord of V7 in second inversion, with D in the bass and F in the upper voice. Your bass then leaps to the seventh of the chord, doubling the upper voice and both resolve on the third of the tonic chord, creating parallel octaves between the upper voice and the bass. Not long after in Bar 6, you double the leading tone between the upper voice and the bass. Doubling the leading tone in this manner between the extreme voices you should avoid as well. From Bar 6 to Bar 7, there is parallel motion in octaves between the extreme parts from one downbeat to the other, another arguable error. In Bar 8 and 18, the parts in the left hand move in octaves, but I think that is okay here because it is common in piano music to play in octaves like that and is not a voice leading mistake. Just look out for these kind of things.  It seems that your whole piece is based on this dotted quarter and three eight note accompaniment, and the little triplet, which is interesting. I think the Coda could be better labeled, so yes.  I like your piece, it reminds me a bit of Beethoven =P. Keep writing!"
composer,3dtbqn,orgymagnet,3,Sun Jul 19 06:41:19 2015 UTC,"Two things:   The orchestral textures you've made are fantastic. I really enjoyed the juxtaposition between the sleigh bells and the dissonance, which set the mood perfectly. It depicted the Krampus tradition very well. You explore too much too quickly. If this is meant to be an excerpt from a ""large"" piece like you said, I fear that you may run out of material soon, and the piece will become unorganized and meaninglessness. You have two ""parts,"" which I'll call A and B. A is the beginning part with the sleigh bells, and B is the part without them until the end. Try to make these parts both twice as long, but, using at most the the material contained within each respective part. You'll see that you have to actually cut down on material to get longer, surprisingly. Exhaust all the variations on the ideas within each part, decide which ones are actually meaningful, and then put them together into a cohesive structure. It may take several drafts."
composer,3dtbqn,qwertyzxcvbnm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:37:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! I heard of the tradition a few years ago when reading who knows what, and was just enamored!   That's an issue I've heard before, that I move off an idea too fast. I'm not really sure how to do variants with it sounding familiar enough that it's not a new idea, but not so unique that it becomes repetitive. I was intending for the whole 'section' uploaded to be the first movement, but I can see how it'd work better if split into two and expanded upon."
composer,3dr51i,Mechelon,2,Sat Jul 18 17:34:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, I really liked it! Good job!  This feels like such a masterly work, I feel terrible and beyond nitpicky for pointing the following out, but since your piece seems like a prime example of modal counterpoint, which I have only studied as species from Fux's book, I couldn't help but notice when I followed the score. In bar 26, it seems to me that the soprano and bass move in parallel fifths from beat one to beat three. I wouldn't think that this a mistake on your part, but rather a deliberate decision. I see that in other passages you treated dissonances rather freely (and by freely I mean ""not as I learned from Fux's book""), but that is okay by me, because I know other great masters took such liberties as well. All in all, the piece sounds great and I love it! That tiny detail simply stood out to me, and its probably of no great importance.  I hope you find yourself struck with inspiration more often, so that we keep hearing your wonderful motets!"
composer,3dr51i,porcos3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:56:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback!  Honestly, in writing this piece, I tried to follow the basic rules of counterpoint (no parallels, contrary motion between the outside voices, dissonance on weak beats, etc.) which is about as extensive as my music knowledge goes! I don't really know anything about modal counterpoint or Fux's book. I took a music theory class sophomore year and have taught myself a little from the internet, but I have yet to learn the finer details of counterpoint.  I basically wrote what sounded nice in my head, and tried to conform it to be limited knowledge of theory...which explains the freely treated dissonances and that parallel fifth (which actually was a mistake).   I'm a senior in high school, but I hope to take composition classes in college to broaden my knowledge in music writing!"

composer,3dqdkc,BWV1080,2,Sat Jul 18 12:52:03 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed your choice of fugue subject, and it works quite well for a baroque style fugue. Your counterpoint was really well executed, and your changes in musical texture were nice to hear.   The tricky thing about fugues, especially baroque fugues, is that it can be easy to get lost in the counterpoint, and it can sound somewhat nonsensical. If you're trying to stay true to the baroque sound, I was suggest using sequencing as a means to keep the focus on the melodic material and prevent the counterpoint from going everywhere. Bach fugues do this plenty, and it fits the style to a point.   I really enjoyed this piece, but I would love to hear in on a piano (I'm a little biased against harpsichord)  Great job!"

composer,3dnt0d,flynnacus,4,Fri Jul 17 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"In short, yes there are ""rules,"" but really they are guidelines. Look at Samuel Adler's Study of Orchestration, or even Rimski Korsokov's Principles of Orchestration, because there are charts on how to arrange chords in different types of ensembles.  As a pretty basic rule of thumb, the best balanced chords are those that have the root in the lowest voices, and the subsequent notes above it in the higher voices. Obviously it gets a little more complicated when you have more instruments and complex timbres, but at the end of the day the goal is to reinforce the fundamental by stacking the overtones in such a way that embellishes desired parts of the harmonic series.   In your case, the strongest way to voice the chord would be to place the root in the trombone, the fifth in the horn, and the third in the alto sax, making sure to keep the space between the different notes as minimal as possible."
composer,3dnt0d,qwertyzxcvbnm,4,Fri Jul 17 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"The most basic rule is to not trust the Finale playback when writing for real instruments. No matter how good the samples, the balance and blend will be significantly different in the real world. Then, as /u/qwertyzxcvbnm suggests, use orchestration books, and look at pieces to see how composers and arrangers you like voice chords. And most important (and hardest to get) is to hear the sounds on real instruments. The more you can get your stuff played, the better sense you'll have for how instruments work together."
composer,3dnt0d,lafoma01,2,Fri Jul 17 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"Especially with saxophone, for some reason finale's saxophone sound is the absolute WORST"

composer,3dnt0d,Bromskloss,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:51 2015 UTC,"In Rimsky Korsakov's treatise it shows you how to balance chords.  The most likely reason why the horn and trombone work so well is because they complement each other's sound.  In the orchestration manual it states that the best way to orchestrate a chord is to blend the instruments together.  E.g if you have a chord of three notes, DO NOT give the top two notes to the flute and the bottom note to the oboe, as so many people do.  Instead, give the top note to the flute, the second highest to the oboe and the bottom note to the flute(according to the effect that you want).  This blends the sound together. I don't know the chord that you were talking about but I would suggest that some form of blending took place when you transferred the chord. The reasons for the improvement in sound can get very complicated(physics and acoustics). I suggest you spend some time on this site it has the treatise online as a free course. http://www.northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php/45270-Welcome-to-the-Garritan-Interactive-PRINCIPLES-OF-ORCHESTRATION-by-Rimsky-Korsakov (Site is down at the moment but I think it is temporary)"
composer,3dnt0d,ianwmoore,2,Sat Jul 18 06:00:46 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think is the most important advice: don't trust how it sounds on Finale. Get some real-world time with the ensemble you're writing for (or a similar one), experiment with having them play different voicings, listen intensely and take notes, and record it if you can."
composer,3dnt0d,CrownStarr,2,Fri Jul 17 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"Also, try to use dovetailing were possible, it often gives better blend between different instrumental sections. And try to avoid putting the lower notes of a chord too close too each other. The lower notes in chords usually sound better with a bit more space between them, the higher notes are fine when close together."
composer,3dnt0d,catpathicus,2,Sat Jul 18 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with just about everyone here: Study orchestration and how instruments in large ensembles interact with one another. Rimsky-Korsakov's book is great, but it covers simply the orchestra (Source: I own it and am reading it). It seems you're looking into band writing, so the Adler Orchestration or even one that specifically covers Wind Band Arrangement might be more beneficial.   I would also suggest studying the Overtone Series. It is essentially a mathematical sequence of frequencies that a single note contains. It can get very technical but a general rule of thumb is that for a clear sounding chord, the lowest note is the root, the second lowest note is an octave higher, next the fifth, then the root, then the third, finally the fifth. To make ""muddier"" chords, go against this general rule.   I probably didn't explain it as well as the wikipedia page on it would, but it's worth studying for large ensembles."

The piece is cohesive, but I feel it was kind of one dimensional because it the texture was very soloist-accompanist and the only time the two featured instruments played together was at the end. I would have enjoyed an exploration into the texture created by the polyphony of the piano and erhu after mm. ~46 to mm. 52, but between the two melodic instruments.  After mm. 52, with the erhu holding the suspended note and the return to the main theme, I feel that that moment could be considered a climax. However, the simple first species counterpoint between the flute and erhu really detracts from the mood because you set up a fantastic expectation with the preceding texture. The texture you use works, especially when considering this is an arrangement of a pop song, but because of all the complex melodic, solo-sounding figures you have created in the middle part of the song, I feel the complexity should have increased until the end, not decreased."

composer,3djkxt,nokes,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"I've seen it both ways, and it works in either case. 8vb is generally a little easier in sight-reading than counting half-a-dozen ledger lines, but even then it's mostly for single notes that low. With chords that drop that low, you can write the whole thing on ledger lines if you need (for big expanded or arpeggiated chords for example) and the pianist can tell what the lowest notes are from the top notes without having to count. And it's not really about assuming; an octave is a different size than a sixth, or seventh, or ninth. So we can tell from judging the space between the notes, whether they are both on lines, or spaces, or one on each, the length of the stem, where the stem ends or the flag lands. As long as you use standard manuscript formatting (or even better a program to get all the sizes and shapes right for you) an octave just looks distinctively ""octave-y"", so we can tell even if it rests on ledger lines we don't often have to read.  If you're writing clusters that low, then 8vb can be helpful because those are shapes that may not be as familiar, so being able to read the notes from the staff (or at least near the staff) and then transposing down an octave can be easier. But, again, either really works."
composer,3djkxt,XyZy,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything that XyZy said. Personally my opinion is avoid 8va/8vb unless necessary and the reason why is psychological: When I'm playing, I think differently when I see the notes physically higher/lower. If it's 8va it's like tricking my brain. I know just fine how to play them but I don't FEEL like they're high. I want the feeling of height or depth. Lightness or gravitas.  And just to underscore XyZy's point: octaves are easy to spot. If I see two notes far apart under the staff, I'm going to assume it's an octave (or notice quickly if it isn't) and just read the top note which is easy to read."

And echoing Xenoceratops, keeping the bass line on the third page under the score (instead of in the score 8vb) gives the bass line some independence as a line, emphasizing that it should be played continuously through the harmonic lines in the upper bass, which is how I'd probably be tempted to play it anyway."

I've also included an exe so that you can run it (as a console program) w/out needing python or the 3rd party module that the program uses.  Anyway let me know what you think."
composer,3dc1jx,Xenoceratops,3,Wed Jul 15 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wing it. Ideas just come to me, and I just keep them in my head as I finish writing them down, then I develop from there."
composer,3dc1jx,AjaxSuited,2,Wed Jul 15 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on the type of texture I want. If I want something flowing I'll usually stick to something even like straight eighth notes or triplets. If I want something more complex, I'll usually write out my harmony in eighth notes, and then choose different notes at random to place off the beat until it sounds right to me.   When I'm writing complicated rhythms, I never trust my ear."
composer,3dc1jx,Jamescalderoncomp,2,Wed Jul 15 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I'll use random.org and have it pick my rhythms. For example, I might tell it to generate random numbers 1-4 and assign 1 to a 16th note, 2 for an 8th note, 3 for a dotted 8th, and 4 for a quarter. I use this sparingly, of course, but sometimes it gives me something pretty neat."
composer,3dc1jx,Buttersnack,2,Wed Jul 15 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"A good question. I just wing it. But maybe that's not completely true. If I have a motive (as I compose motivically) with a prominent rhythmic component, I might consciously change the rhythm. I heard a presentation from Jason Eckardt on how he composes. He is 100% rhythm based. You can't imagine the pages of preparation he does with math and numbers to work out a consistent logic behind what seems are his chaotic tuplets. His melodic gestures are actually undergirded by the same numbers that run his rhythmic units."
composer,3dc1jx,Classh0le,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a drummer for 19 years and have a Master's in Comp.  When I'm doing a free style solo, sometimes I'll find myself singing random pitches to (somewhat) match what my hands are doing.  In that sense, I've always been able to ""wing it"" as my improvisational skills are probably more refined than my reading skills.    On the other hand, taking an intellectual approach can be beneficial as well.  To me, this element is more present in academic music.  Having a thorough knowledge of theory only enhances your vocabulary when improvising.  In other words, there is a symbiosis ""winging it"" vs. analyzing/planning.    Of course there are general rules/practices that make a melody more effective in it's environment-contour, balance, direction, etc.  Those types of elements should be considered no matter your approach."

Having a thorough knowledge of theory only enhances your vocabulary when improvising. In other words, there is a symbiosis ""winging it"" vs. analyzing/planning.   I agree. I do a bit of both, but I am generally more inclined to go with my intuitive sense than to plan my rhythms (outside of motivic content). I recently read a PDF on a piece that uses a magic square as a compositional device. I've never created a prescriptive system like that for rhythm with any success, preferring to take every duration on an individual basis (or at least in relation to the context and environment). It intrigued me that somebody went ahead and committed to this sort of thing (though they gave their self a bit of wiggle room)."
composer,3dc1jx,to7m,2,Wed Jul 15 09:21:59 2015 UTC,"I have systems and things, but they're mostly internalised so I guess I wing it. Sometimes I try to keep the rhythm flowing, other times I develop motifs, go for contrast to prevent grooves emerging, use theory as a starting point (cross-rhythms, polymeters, serial tempo stuff which is useful mainly for practice), prioritise performance (making it readable/learnable), and so on."
composer,3dc1jx,crustysenor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:37:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the composition. There are times when winging it and organically developing a rhythmic idea is best. Other times, serial rhythm is a good way to go."
composer,3d9dyd,WelcomeToMoonCity,2,Tue Jul 14 15:03:30 2015 UTC,"Nice work! This was really pretty and enjoyable to listen to. Do you happen to have a score? I'm a violinist and I'd love to learn and record it for you (I'd have to play the guitar part on piano).   I thought your melodies were really flowing and pretty, and you made a very nice contrast between the three pieces. My biggest concern is that it felt more like ""Three Simple Songs for Violin and Guitar Accompaniment."" A duo like that should have material to consider both instruments as soloists, rather than one as the lead and the other as accompaniment. Unless your intention was that it was a violin piece with guitar accompaniment.   Otherwise, it is a very nice piece, and I'll be checking out some of your other works later on."
composer,3d9dyd,Jamescalderoncomp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the compliments! A recording would be absolutely wonderful -- I have never had anything of mine recorded before. I'd be perfectly happy with a piano accompaniment rather than a guitar. If you message me your email, I can send you the scores that way, or you can let me know how you'd like to get them.  Now that you mention it, I probably should've named it Three Simple Songs for Violin and Accompaniment (I don't mind whether it's guitar or piano, it's just that I'm a guitar player myself). It was actually going to be a ""Violin Sonata in A Major"" at first, but it ended up sounding more like a song cycle than a sonata.   Anyway, I can't tell you how excited I'd be if you do end up making a recording. It would be a real honor. Thanks for listening!"
composer,3d7lmt,HardxCorps,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:32:20 2015 UTC,"This is really cool. It has a jazzy/minimalism feel and it's really catchy. I like how you used the whole tone runs as part of the melody as well as the accompaniment, it made the work feel more organic. I also really enjoyed the harmonies you used.   A couple thoughts: I felt that the work was missing something contrasting. While there were different sections with different textures, it all felt stylistically the same. Maybe it's just me, but I think the piece would really benefit from a section that sounds very different from this to add depth. At 2:48 you introduce what sounds like a choral, but then return immediately to the original content, maybe that could be expanded on?   I also really liked where you had each voice enter with the theme separately, almost like a fugue, it would have been cool to see an actual fugue develop out of those points. Maybe I'm just biased to them though.  I really enjoyed listening to this piece, I repeated it several times while typing this and will probably listen to some more later. Keep it up!"

composer,3d1hii,Palmer27,4,Sun Jul 12 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"You want the full version of Sibelius. Avoid First. The education package is just a discount; you have to prove that you are a student or educator in order to get the discount.  Personally, I am a fan of Finale. Unfortunately, the current incarnation of that software (Finale 2014) is not stable but MakeMusic seems to think that everything is fine and does not appear to be working on patching the software. At the same time, Finale 2012 and prior versions are no longer being supported and have not been updated to run well on the current operating systems."
composer,3d1hii,Xenoceratops,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I agree on avoiding Sibelius First. Tbh I've always heard Sibelius > Finale - but I suppose its just what you're comfortable with using. I've only ever used Sibelius, what are some of the benefits of Finale?"
composer,3d1hii,SocialIssuesAhoy,3,Sun Jul 12 20:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'm your opposite, I've only ever used Finale. I've heard that they're virtually identical and it really is just two different workflows, you get used to one and it works for you. That being said, let me share my Finale experience briefly:   To date, I don't think there's been a single thing that I wanted to do that wasn't technically possible. If you really want I can grab some screenshots to show you some of the unconventional things I've gotten done with it. That being said, I haven't been able to figure out nearly everything on my own. Even though I'm the sort to do that. Fortunately, and this is a plus for me, Finale has extensive documentation. If I google ""X problem Finale"" there will almost definitely be a result from the official Finale documentation online. For more advanced/complicated things, there will usually be some online discussion in the results which helps, especially combined with their documentation. Basically I'm saying there's plenty of support. The program IS a little buggy. Not as in crashing, I haven't had much of an issue with that, although I save a LOT just in case because I've been burned before. But it's more like there's just random glitches that get annoying sometimes. It also sometimes just gets a little laggy after I've been working for hours. All of these problems have been fixable by just completely quitting it and then reopening it.   I think that basically sums it up... it's not nearly perfect as far as software goes, but I trust it to not fail on me and to allow me to do whatever I need, one way or another."
composer,3d1hii,Xenoceratops,2,Mon Jul 13 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"Formatting, beaming, and time signatures are a million times easier in Finale, and the notation looks prettier. That's a few big ones for me. I prefer data entry in Finale. The only thing that I prefer in Sibelius is cross-measure beaming, but the regular beaming tool suuuucks.  It all comes down to personal preference and what you learn, but I do feel that Finale is more powerful and more ""serious."" Now if only MakeMusic could get their act together and get Finale back to 2011 stability."
composer,3d1hii,whitenoise23,2,Mon Jul 13 02:16:18 2015 UTC,Spot on. I cannot wait until Steinberg releases their notation software. If you haven't heard about it check out the development blog. The level of detail and consideration they are taking with this is unparalleled. It's going to blow both Finale and Sibelius out of the water.
composer,3d1hii,Xenoceratops,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I'll believe it when I see it.  I'm considering LilyPond, but I hate how every single pitch has to be specifically named. ABC notation is more efficient in that regard, but is nowhere near as powerful."
composer,3d1hii,belleistic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"the reason why I use Sibelius is because it has and can run better sounds. finale sounds REALLY bad, sometimes I don't know how people stand it. Finale does seem to be preferred by most composition professors I've met though.  i know that's not what you asked I just wanted to add my opinion."
composer,3d1hii,radams68,2,Mon Jul 13 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"Of course, if you're on a budget, there's MuseScore."
composer,3d1hii,Raptros,3,Mon Jul 13 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"Trying musescore after using sibelius for so long in school was a traumatic experience... Sure it's free, but I found it impossible to compose at the speed I'm used to because of the super clunky UI."
composer,3d1hii,Xenoceratops,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:37 2015 UTC,Ditto. Worse yet is Noteflight.
composer,3d1hii,Raptros,2,Mon Jul 13 17:19:54 2015 UTC,I have the educational version. It's really no different feature wise than the full site licence we have in school.
