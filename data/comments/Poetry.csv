Poetry,3e44p3,LinenPotato,3,Tue Jul 21 23:03:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your question. I started writing at a very young age. I was a bit of an angry child so I found writing (and martial arts) as a way to constructively deal with it. The older I got the more I started to write about my experiences as a way to ""vent"". I really fell in love with it after that.  As far as the second question I actually have a few different techniques. My first is always reflection, drop the pen, pencil or simply step away from the keyboard, collect your thoughts, think about what you are trying to say, specifically what you are trying to get out, and return to it a few minutes, hours, days later. Never rush your work, whatever your goal for writing is, it may take time. The second is read. Pull something out from your favorite poet. I honestly wish I had known about reddit ocpoetry a long time ago. Sometimes getting in tune with other writers is a helpful tool. Never be afraid to interact, critique or accept criticism. The third is keep writing. I have about 30 unfinished ""drafts"" right now.  Phrases, sentences, random thoughts and ideas. Write whatever comes to mind and let the rest come together later. A bit of a long winded answer I know. I hope I answered your question thoroughly."

I did like the Dark Tower series until the end, which I found quite disappointing and almost like a knock off of a twilight zone episode. I felt sort of cheated. However. I suppose if you look at it like  the Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came poem, that it is really about the journey and overcoming many obstacles, then you could say the series is like the poem in that sense and I never really thought of it that way.  Anyway, the poem is interesting and quite stunning in imagination for something written in the 1850s."

He is most famous for his last poem, which - after complaining about lack of ink - he wrote in his own blood. He killed himself the next day or, depending on who you ask, was assassinated by NKVD. In any case, he was so popular at the time that his death set off a wave of copycat suicides (NKVD wasn't responsible for any of those, presumably).   As you can see, he was quite the troublemaker.   English translations of his works are a bit lacking, but the poems are enjoyable nonetheless. Some of my favorites are A Letter To Mother  Yes It's settled  Son of a bitch     You don't love me   ...and the first poem that got my attention (it is no coincidence that it's very short)  ""Snow-clad is the plain, and the moon is white Covered with a shroud is my country side.

Here are two I use most often: ""8 Count"" ""Against Still Life""  Their poems are deceivingly simple, but use very clear concise language. Bukowski is good for teaching form/sound/rhythm, while Atwood uses a lot of the more traditional literary devices, like metaphor. Another solid go-to is Philip Larkin's ""this be the verse"". This poem is great for teaching the relationship between form and content and for demonstrating breaks and shifts in the logic of a poem."

Poetry,3dppv3,Earthsophagus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too surprised if someone comes in and corrects me, but generally, rhyme schemes happen at the end of the line—that's sort of why poetry was broken up into lines, originally (in combination with meter). Since there are no real RULES for rhymes within a line—i.e. when to expect them to appear, where to be placed—it's kind of impossible to form a consistent in-line notation that could work across all poetry.  That wouldn't stop you from being clever and coming up with something that works for whatever project you have, but I don't know of anything formal that already exists."

Poetry,3dn94q,poiitis,6,Fri Jul 17 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"For me, a poem comes out fully formed maybe once every two years. So I need an editing strategy almost 100% of the time.  That strategy starts with trying in the moment. I write the poem and I work it over a few times. Make sure the words feel right in the moment. Then I put it away for a few days. I come back to it with ""fresh eyes"" and dig in. I usually try to cut one-third to one-half of it because I know I write too loosely at first. I also then make sure the title and enjambement are doing enough work. I then read it again and again and again, tweaking a little each time, and eventually I hit a point of diminishing returns and I stop.  Sometimes I repeat that entire ""fresh eyes"" process again a few days later, but usually that first round does it."
Poetry,3dn94q,jessicay,3,Fri Jul 17 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"My main points of focus are making my poetry look professional. My grammar and punctuation are absolutely abominable so I need to reread it a couple of times. I usually stop once I get tired/blind to the poem because I've read it too many times. At that point I usually take a break.   I know what you mean about how you feel your best work usually feels like it comes out perfect on the first write-through. I usually feel the same, but it's usually just my complacency or fear of messing up what I consider a good poem. However, I will say that all of what I consider my best work has been heavily edited. Heavy editing can seem to mess it up at first, but that's mainly due to changing the flow and work choice the first time through to be more formal or just overall better. Whenever I come back a few days later and read through it again that's my main focus; pumping the poem with flow and the natural sound.   Unless your poems are kept to a simple idea or structure, I would recommend to nearly always go back and give it some light editing at least.  A lot of it is a matter of acquired taste though, you need to read and get criticism on your work a lot to find out what about your poems comes out good enough, and what needs to be changed. I suggest you start to read some good, free periodicals like Thrush, Rattle or the Beloit Poetry Journal to see what you do, and don't like about both yours and others poetry.   E: Speaking of editing, I did none to this so please excuse my terrible writing. It's really late and I need to be getting to bed. Jessicay is an actual poet(ess? if that's the word) so you should probably pay more attention to her (awesome) response."

Poetry,3dn94q,Deblyns,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:32 2015 UTC,Find some friends you trust (poet friends) and let them rip it to shreds. This works best if you have them look at it right after you've finished writing. If you wait too long the sounds get familiar and things that are familiar often feel right even if they are just familiar and not beyond critique.
Poetry,3dn94q,celest123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:26 2015 UTC,"All poems need work. That's my approach. As I write, I'm always editing and changing. Normally, I'll let something sit for a couple months and then come back to it. This allows me to act as both the reader and the writer and more clearly see where my poem needs work. After it feels polished, I send it out for publication. If it gets rejected multiple times, I revisit it again, polish it more. I don't know. I'm always tweaking. Nothing ever feels finished! It's an endless process."
Poetry,3dn94q,bAyleighVlogs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"It is hard to edit poems that do feel fully formed, but as everyone said, just let it sit for a bit. I've had poems sit in a file for years before they feel solid, and I've had some that maybe take a week.   I've only had two poems that felt ""perfect"" as they were coming out of my brain, but then I workshopped them, and it was SO helpful to see the work through other peoples' eyes. I'll totally ignore some criticism, but there is always at least one thing I can take away to edit the poem, usually more.  Basically, just give it a little time. There's no deadline to complete a poem (save for schoolwork...), and you never know what might pop into your head to make the piece even better."

Poetry,3dk2r5,anemoi-,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"Adjusting the space that the eyes of the reader have to jump allows the poet to play with the relative stress that is felt on the disconnected parts. There is a momentary pause felt as we move from one line to the next, and it is this feeling that the poet is playing with when they decide to adjust spacing. The first words mentioned after a long pause will be felt more strongly, and the last words before a long pause will linger for fractionally longer. A skilled poet is attuned to these differences and can deploy spacing to alter the poem's reception.  There is also an old convention to add spacing to indicate rhyming lines, but this isn't in play in either of your examples.  Adjusting spacing within a line can function like the visual equivalent of a caesura, although with more fine-tuned control."

Poetry,3dg58a,aknalid,12,Thu Jul 16 00:29:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm gonna suggest something completely different that you didn't ask for, but this is how I got into poetry. I took a course on Coursera about modern poetry. You can go through at your own pace, stop or skip whenever you want. You're taken through the different branches of poetry (Dickinson and Whitman, imagist, beat, etc). You read the poems and listen to a group discussion with a handful of UPenn students.  The reason I suggest this is that it will teach you how to read poetry. That may sound condescending, but if you try it, you'll see what I mean. I was totally missing things quite often and the discussions helped turn some poems that I thought were nonsense into some of my favourites. I also come from a scientific background so I needed help to get out of the logical/analytical approach, and I got to see a good cross-section of poetry while I was at it. I think it might work better for you than just picking up a random poetry book (and it's free)."

The hard-faced men In black coats who chase you for hours In dreams--that's the only way to get you To the shore. Sometimes those hard women Who abandon you get you to say, ""You."" A lazy part of us is like a tumbleweed. It doesn't move on its own. It takes sometimes  A lot of Depression to get tumbleweeds moving. Then they blow across three or four States.

Poetry,3dgpnv,Twitchy_throttle,3,Thu Jul 16 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"In case you can't follow the link:  The wrecks dissolve above us; their dust drops down from afar—  Down to the dark, to the utter dark, where the blind white sea-snakes are.  There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,  Or the great grey level plains of ooze where the shell-burred cables creep.  Here in the womb of the world—here on the tie-ribs of earth  Words, and the words of men, flicker and flutter and beat—  Warning, sorrow and gain, salutation and mirth -  For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.  They have wakened the timeless Things; they have killed their father Time   Joining hands in the gloom, a league from the last of the sun.  Hush! Men talk to-day o'er the waste of the ultimate slime,  And a new Word runs between: whispering, 'Let us be one!'"

Poetry,3d92qd,AmLowell,2,Tue Jul 14 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Howard Rosenberg  UNPREPARED FOR THE AFTERLIFE  He pulls the knife out of my corpse, rinses  off blood, skin, bone, shock—they clog  the sink’s strainer. I can’t empty it. Anger  erupts, Vesuvius; my translucent form  inflates. I still hover in the same place.  Why can’t I move? I can see but can’t  close my eyes: I don’t have any. He turns  toward me. “No!” I shout without a mouth.  He hurries through me. For an instant,  I swallow him. He peeks at the street,  grabs my wrists, drags my body to the door.  “Stop! It’s mine.” He opens the door, glances  left, right, pulls my carcass into the corridor.  The door shuts. Grief wraps me in its mist,  my shroud, now a straitjacket. Someone  bangs on the door. “Who is it?” I scream  in my silent voice. “It’s me,” I whisper."

Emily Dickinson and e. e. cummings wrote lots of striking short poems (they aren't in the same league in my opinion, but cummings is perfectly adequate for a cute bit of packaging :-))"

Poetry,3d5xzw,the-thiiird,6,Mon Jul 13 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"No matter how slow you think you're speaking, speak a little slower.  Move around a little - walk about the stage and more your hands. Your movement will relax you, and also make the audience a little more relaxed too. And it will distract them somewhat, if you movement is natural and not overdone. Your hand movements will also help you think about what you are saying, because your hands often naturally move in response to the gravity of your words. And if you let that happen, you will find that your hands tell YOU what is important and it will tell you what to emphasize and phrase with the proper stress.  And when you practice, do it in front of a mirror AND video yourself.  Watch the video. Even if the first few times are painful, you will get better."

It added some security and it helped the mood because, well, my poetry is darker and I like writing horror. Anyway, it has been said, enunciate and you will get a hang of it."

Poetry,3d5xzw,Valchrist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:15:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I envy you and what you are about to experience. Open Mics, and specifically Poetry Open Mics, can be a very rewarding experience.  Don't worry about being nervous. Everyone is nervous in the beginning. The first 30 or some times that I read at an open mic I was shaking so bad that I had to grab on to something weighty (my notebook) to stop the fluttering of my printed out poems.  Memorization is overrated. Read the poem the way that makes you most comfortable. Imagine you are reading the poem to your friends and family..because I can tell you from experience, most poetry open mic audiences will treat you as such already.  It also helps if you let people know that this is your first time. Everyone always lets out cheers of approval when someone says that at the open mic I host. ...Ah, I think that's enough for now. If you have any more questions or anything, please let me know. Poetry and open mics play a huge role in my life.   Break a leg!"
Poetry,3d5xzw,Unintendo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"I went and read for the first time a few weeks back. It's definitely nerve wracking, but if you've practiced it flies by really quick. Just be confident and speak clearly and you'll do just fine!"
Poetry,3d5xzw,kageookami64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"Man, I miss doing open mic readings. All of the opens around me are music or stand-up.  The first time I went up, I was right after the local celebrity. Everyone was chanting his name before the host even said he was coming up, and of course he killed it to roaring cheers. Then they called me and I could hear my own footsteps echoing through the room.  I don't know how long you've been writing poetry, but my advice is to treat your first readings as an opportunity to find your voice. You're not there to kill the room on your first go. You're there to feel it out - see what feels right and what feels forced - so that two, three, twenty readings down the line when you have a better idea of who you are as a reader you'll be able to connect with an audience.  That said, attitude can sell poetry even when the audience can't make out the word. Don't force anything, but if the words move you, go with it. If you write humor, remember that timing and pacing are key to hitting your punchlines. If it's musical, don't be afraid to let the flow feel like a song. If you write anger, let the hate simmer on a low boil and save the rage for the big moments.  Whatever happens, cheer for your fellow poets because chances are that most of them - even the seasoned vets - feel just as nervous as you do."
Poetry,3d5xzw,opheliaks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:01:30 2015 UTC,"Stand up straight,  take deep, slow breathes. Enunciate fully and make sure you keep the pace of your poem. Punctuation is important, especially in public speaking.   Make eye contact,  and make sure that your poem and your emotions are coming through over the anxiety. You can tell by watching your audience.  Hope it all goes well!"
