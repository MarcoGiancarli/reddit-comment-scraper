An interesting (and more flawed than the original) take on the watchmaker argument: no matter how precise we make our watches, they always lose or gain time. They'll never be as perfect as God's watch, the heavens. Big Bang violates first law of thermodynamics, proving that a divine ""someone"" must have created the universe. Radioactive elements still existing proves that the universe isn't eternal into the past, which disproves evolution. (What? This one seems incoherent.) Something can't come from nothing. Evolution violates second law of thermodynamics. Traditional watchmaker argument, complete with ""consider the common mousetrap"". Irreducible complexity."

Cenk hosts a propaganda and slander internet video rag. Cenk hosted many people on whose agenda it was to slag off Sam Harris. Which Cenk applauded.  Sam Harris during this interview did nothing except try to remain standing through an onslaught of ridiculous bill oreilly style bullshit. Completely pointless. All the while everyone gets to miss out on an opportunity to move on to Sam's other points.  Throughout the interview regardless, Sam wields intellectual prowess so high above Cenk that Cenk doesn't even see it. Sam Harris defends himself somewhat magnificently.  And then immediately afterward when the video is posted online and people start asking Cenk to apologise, he refuses. His pig headedness has prevented him from learning anything from Sam Harris. And, as his crap ""journalism"" show continues, Cenk has again reverted to slandering Sam Harris.  Straight up going against everything that during this interview Sam Harris made sure Cenk found an agreement on. Cenk, the dishonest (or incredibly dense) piece of shit, still to this day claims that Sam Harris called for a nuclear first strike against the muslim world. That wasn't even something that was controversial when this interview came out, nobody thought Sam Harris had said that. Yet TYT has been repeating it so many times, and their ilk, and their followers, that some people actually believe it.  Someone is going to reply in this very comment thread claiming Sam Harris said that. I guarantee it. That is how dumb TYT and their ilk's viewers are."

I'm very happy I took the time to look into PBS.  They cover the story, all aspects of it very quickly and sturdily. There was no mood music and after they covered the whole story which took about 15-20 minutes they moved on to others.  At the end of the segment they tell you exactly where you can find more information about everything they had just been talking about.  All of their news programs are available online for free.

I see the need for a brash, overbearing TV show news host that just 'spits in the face' of the guest.  It's necessary sometimes; provided you understand that the deeper point is way more nuanced.  That's where Cenk fails, in my opinion.  Harris is amazingly nuanced, and keeps getting pull-quoted out of context.  His concepts are hard to grasp, though, and he ends up speaking 'over' people's heads to a point where they just get frustrated with him.

atheistvids,3dkbtf,gridpoint,0,Fri Jul 17 05:17:26 2015 UTC,"Then again though, if a country knew that it was going to experience an imminent nuclear holocaust and the leadership knew they could minimize the damage from said attack by attacking the aggressor nation first, I think many countries with a ""no first strike policy"" would under those circumstances strike first.

Cenk despite his idiocy might have been trying to point out how a preemptive strike doctrine was one of those beliefs.   One cannot absolutely know for certain whether an aggressor nation is going to launch nukes. Not unless they actually launch them. There are any number of circumstances that can prevent a launch despite what anyone thinks should happen. Ever watch Crimson Tide? That's the whole reason for a having ""no first strike policy"".

Affleck isn't having a conversation and typically people with this kind of attitude aren't having conversations, they are arguing buzzwords for the sake of self righteousness or politically correct righteousness.  This always comes across to me as a lack of critical thinking skills combined with ego. Although i try not to assume anything about anyone, people show themselves to be who they are over time."

Shame on you while you do this! Make the best use of the time you’ve got left. This is really serious."

atheistvids,3d0mdc,LiquidDemons,2,Sun Jul 12 17:05:36 2015 UTC,Me too. He has a great channel.
atheistvids,3d03at,DixonTheJewBag,5,Sun Jul 12 10:17:05 2015 UTC,"""how do you know that you know"" isnt even really an argument because he doesnt even describe his own ideas or solutions. even if the world is a giant simulation and everything is fake, that doesnt change the fact that our responses to stimulus are consistent within the simulation. they might be ""wrong"" in whatever ""real"" world that we arent aware of, but up to this point there have been zero major consequences for us using our senses and logic to navigate our perceived reality."
atheistvids,3d03at,trevlacessej,2,Sun Jul 12 14:39:38 2015 UTC,I find these presuppositional like Eric Hovind for more difficult to deal with even though their arguments don't actually mean anything.  Pretty much what their argument boils down to you can know anything because you don't know God.  And they pretty much have a script of step by step instructions of arguing their point of view. And what's worse is when someone explains things in a rational matter they never give counter points or other explanations for an answer. They only try to give reasons why the atheist is wrong instead of reasons why they are right.
atheistvids,3d03at,HumbleCalamity,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that the epistemological angle is so much more difficult to deal with without a Ph.D. in Philosophy.  Providing a groundwork for ""I think, therefore I am,"" is actually incredibly important for every human to explain when exploring a worldview.    The thing is, it's almost impossible to get anywhere in these arguments without simply supposing axioms and adopting exclusion principles / logic.  The key to any discussion like this is to mirror the argument back at the questioner.  In this case, the only meaningful discussion that took place occured in the last 60 seconds where one party admitted that they would accept an axiom of the supernatural THE EXACT SAME WAY another would accept an axiom of reality / reasonability.    It might seem that these arguments are cop-outs or fillibustering the conversation intentionally, but you have to start from some common ground on a thinking stance before you can literally have any sort of meaningful conversation.  You must first agree on the rules of a discussion before you may have one."

You are telling me that someone made them,  yet you tell me your God wasn't made.  Who is God's creators creator creatorsinfinity?"
atheistvids,3cunjl,sagar1101,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If complex systems can't assemble at random and were created by a creator then he/she/it would also have been created since an entity capable of creating complex systems would itself be incredibly complex. Again, the creator of this creator would also have been created and so on leading to an infinite regression.  Edit: Grammar"
