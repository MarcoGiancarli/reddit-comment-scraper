It's not professional, it's made of cardboard cut from food boxes.  I know how to cook, but I am not a chef. I could post videos with instructions on how I cook the things that I do, but I am not a professional cook and am not on a level where I should be giving advice or lessons on cooking.

I recommend a net, like for fishing, to cover your torso, it's breathable, but covering. If you want to be a bit funny (and make a bit of a statement) you could make pasties to put over your nipples (simple school glue can keep them in place for hours).  Plus a net can be draped many ways depending on how warm it is and how you want it to look, you can use tight netting (with small holes) or loose netting (larger holes).  Foam for shoulder pads is great, and you can have warbla over it to give a really good look. Or use layers of crafting foam (that's what I do)."

cosplayers,3dw5sy,beelzeybob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"You could subsitute wig hair, but honestly the reason crepe wool is usually used is because the fibers have a tedency to stick together in chunks and not fall apart easily, unlike syntethic wig hairs, which makes the facial hair you're trying to recreate much more ""sculptaple"", whereas with synthetic wig hairs... well have you ever given yourself a haircut? ....yeah.   If you're looking for something you can reuse and you can just peel on your face then the lace-front beard might be your best bet.

I really wouldn't recommend using styrene for something with complex curves like that in this case.   It's great for vacuum forming, but you need a mold/plaster/wooden form to lay it over to give it shape, if you bend it with a heat gun you have to be careful about heating it as it will curl up easily. It's really not a thermoplastic meant for shaping with hands like sintra/worbla/wonderflex.    When vacuum forming it (heating the plastic in an oven) you have to clamp or tape the plastic to a wooden frame just so the plastic doesn't warp. Not to say that an organic shape can't be made, but it's a fair bit of work and you have to make sure it doesn't have any extreme undercuts that will impede taking off the styrene.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cox8fR1rUBI"

cosplayers,3dt9u3,incandescance,3,Sun Jul 19 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you're making that I would go the worbla route, it lends itself to curves like that much easier than sintra, as well as being more forgiving and wasteless as you can roll up your scraps and use them to build up spots."

It doesn't stretch, so you have a wrinkle in the dome shape unless you start with a wedge cut out of it and make a seam.  It works fine that way, I just put the pads on my Agent Kallus helmet made of Syntra, but I had to cut a lot of V's out of them, heat form it and then epoxy the seams and sand it smooth.  Especially because a perfect smooth shiny surface isn't needed I'd totally go with Worbla instead."

cosplayers,3dkfcq,humm1n984D93R,2,Fri Jul 17 14:22:31 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this would not work. I found this article that explains    that 1 liter of helium can lift a gram of matter so all you have to do is calculate your weight in grams; one pound equals about 453.6 grams. It also helps to know how many liters of helium the average balloon can hold – approximately 14.   So even if your prop cat weighed just one pound it would take 32 balloons to achieve lift. Even with 32 balloons it would probably only hover right above the ground. To obtain the height you want it would need quite a bit more. Have you considered just using a cat shaped balloon?

You can find a list of commissioners to hire, and if you're not picky about used things, you can also look at the 'for sale' section and see if perhaps someone already made what you're looking for.  Assuming this is for AAC 2015 though, you are probably a bit late to get something custom made. It's best to look for a commissioner 6+ months in advance, more if it's for something big. The really popular commissioners are booked in over a year in advance! Unless what you're looking for is simple, small, or popular enough such that someone might have one premade, it will be hard to find someone to make it now, and even if they will, there will probably be a rush fee included.

cosplayers,3div6e,speakingofnaked,3,Thu Jul 16 19:31:10 2015 UTC,have you tried a cotton buffer and buffing compound? It will slowly polish it off without leaving scratches.

cosplayers,3dhdad,iovita2,2,Thu Jul 16 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"I've played with polycarbonate some, and it's terribly durable and terribly unforgiving when trying to mold it. You need to get it pretty warm for it to keep it's shape, but it's super-easy to warp it and I don't think you can get this shape anyway.  I think I found the photo you referred to (the link was bad):  http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comicsandcosplay/cosplaygalleries/13739-WonderCon-2015-Cosplay-Gallery-Day-Two-Game-of-Thrones-and-Agent.14  I can't imagine what he's using for the dome. It looks like one solid piece, but I could be wrong. You might be able to buy something online that you can mold, but again, this is fraught with peril. The best I can suggest is to look at plastics companies that make plastic... things. And look around to see if you can find things that have that shape. Also, if you have a maker space in your area, they might have a vacuum forming machine to make that shape out of transparent plastic, but you'd need to make a mold first.   I've never worked with Worbla, but I'm very interested in this transparent variety. I imagine it would also be challenging to make something of this size and possibly a bit expensive. :)"

It has a few extra armor plates and shoulders that didn't get finished in time for the con so they don't have bindings, so it'd be best retrofitted by someone with some work experience with costumes. It isn't designed too poorly for sizing, I've had a few other people try it on (the main size restrictions are the bicep armor pieces, but they could easily be sliced and sealed, I'm a fairly large guy and had a smaller person wear it for some tests at one point.)  The armor could also easily be repainted to be something else. The only Targaryen factor is the logo on the chestpiece."

They were ok to wear all day long but I don't think that kind of boots will be very good for a superhero look...  The boot cover technique the other user posted looks very good and easy to use though and it might be better than using rain boots as a base since they're very loose looking.  It all depends on the end result you're looking for though. If you need to glue stuff on rubber boots, by the way, Shoe Goo is a amazing."

I say 6, but drop the stripe in the pants, not only is it a bigger pain to sew, a solid black would look better, maybe drop the white cuff as well, as it mostly just goes with that white stripe on the pants"
cosplayers,3dbxfj,SIipB,3,Wed Jul 15 01:59:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, cosplay isn't about what you look like. It's about being the characters you like, and how much time/effort/skills/money you have to invest. Pick one you like, evaluate your time/effort/skills/money and see if you can do it. Can you make a replica Marshall Lee guitar? Can you sew or afford Lockhart's robes? These are much better questions to ask that ""what character do I look like?"". It doesn't matter if you're the spitting image of Batman if you can't make/buy the outfit."
cosplayers,3dbxfj,Zaiteria,3,Wed Jul 15 12:37:57 2015 UTC,"Zaiteria's very valid questions aside, a good Guilderoy would be a great cosplay.  Many cosplays are about the dressing up, but there are some, like Guilderoy would be, are about the acting and the personality you put into it.  Just walking around dressed like him isn't enough.  If you can pull off Branagh's swagger, then it would be a great cosplay for just a set of robes and a book with a fake cover."

cosplayers,3d7m2c,xencosti,2,Tue Jul 14 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"Even lightening will be difficult. The key to pulling this off would be distressing it.   What is the material? If synthetic, you would just paint it with acrylic paints and fabric medium. The key would be to dab, not brush ( sea sponges from a craft store are great for this ). If the material is cotton, then you can lighten it without removing all the color by the dunk method. Get a plastic tub with diluted bleach, another full of a neutralizing agent. Once lightened to the desired shade in the first tub, stick immediately into the second. The weaker the bleach the longer it will take.   See the link for further info  http://www.wikihow.com/Neutralize-Bleach  Personally, I would paint then entire piece to have more control and  to cover the orange stitching.   Good luck"

Boots are hard to find for lots of things, but making calf-covers that come down over the tops of your shoes is pretty easy (relatively speaking).  If you make it out of the same material or the same colour as your shoes they're pretty close."

Hair chalk doesn't seem to be incredibly effective. I tried it for my eyebrows with my Ganondorf cosplay and it didn't even color them a bit so I didn't even get to try sealing the color in with hairspray after. I couldn't try on my actual hairs since I have a shaved head. It cost me like 12-13$ for the chalks (came in like 4 colors for kids to mess around with - sold at walmart, maybe there are professional stuff out there but I didn't find it). I can't imagine doing someone's whole hairs with it. It would look very crusty (from reviews I read, it seemed to be the general consensus).  I think the investment in a good quality wig is important. You just shouldn't go cheap at that point since it's one of the pieces on a cosplay that makes or breaks it in my opinion. Plus, using chalks to dye a full head temporary will end up costing you more than the wig probably would in the long run if you wear the costume a few times a year."
cosplayers,3cmbuz,Azzypoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason you don't want to get a wig?

cosplayers,3ci7fv,eldunariya,2,Wed Jul 8 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"To help keep your stitches consistent, use the tip of the needle to measure them, (relative measurement).  Thimbles are very helpful, especially when working with thick or heavy fabrics, and/or multi layers.  They go on the finger you use to push the needle through.  Fray-check is a useful product to prevent the material from fraying.  and check out /r/sewing.  I'm sure there's a whole lot more, but that's just off the top of my head.  Oh, and measure, measure, measure, THEN cut.  :)"
cosplayers,3ci7fv,CostumingMom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:18:41 2015 UTC,"If there's any part you don't feel like sewing, there's this iron on stuff called Stitch Witchery. It's a sort of thin tape you put between layers of fabric you want sewn, then iron over to activate it. It's durable, at least for what I've used it for (mostly details and embelishments), and much faster than sewing by hand. Craft and fabric stores should carry it. I love this stuff so much!"

cosplayers,3ch4xy,AlpacaYourBags,2,Tue Jul 7 23:22:06 2015 UTC,This person has uploaded outlines that you could print (and scale as necessary) for the designs. This person shows variations from different games.  For the zig zag: If scale isn't a huge concern you might be able to find a blue trim (like rick rack) that you can just sew on.  If you want a similar scale you may have to make your own. Use a fabric that doesn't fray or prepare to finish edges. Fold a piece of paper and cut (like a paper snowflake) until you figure out a good size. Using a strip of cloth of the same size (+ some excess) of the base of the skirt and fold and cut the same as your paper template.  You will probably need to cut in sections.
cosplayers,3ch4xy,Atharsea,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:52:00 2015 UTC,You are awesome!  Thank you. Do you think fabric paint for the designs is a good idea?  White fabric paint should be opaque enough to show on blue fabric right?
cosplayers,3ch4xy,Atharsea,2,Wed Jul 8 13:18:25 2015 UTC,"Fabric paint should work, if you can get some that you can cover a large enough area with (You'd go through a lot small bottles, and some are hard to squeeze. Something you can brush on for the large areas might make it easier."

cosplayers,3cd0xj,disorder1991,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:25:22 2015 UTC,If you know vote to sew you can make it from scratch with red cloth. But as far as eyes go when you are making the mask cut out eye holes and then lay a see through mesh over them. Similar to morph suits.
cosplayers,3cd0xj,deamonskull,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:06:58 2015 UTC,Any thin black fabric will let you see through it (at least a little) but still look black from outside. So long as you're not in direct sunlight.
cosplayers,3cd0xj,Spidon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck with black panty hose, honestly. Though if you are making the mask out of something sturdier like wonderflex or leather, you can make the eyes out of dark sunglasses lenses or out of a material called buckram that's usually used for millinery. You can mold the buckram into a bit of a curve with water before you paint it black so that there's room for your eyeballs. That's also the benefit of sunglasses - leaves room for the curve of your eye and eyelashes so you're not constantly blinking against a flat surface."

cosplayers,3cacew,seacee,2,Mon Jul 6 10:08:12 2015 UTC,"Look up light up eye tutorials. Most notably for Iron Man helmets.  The gist of it is you take a bit of plexiglass or whatever clear plastic you're making your lenses out of, tint them with your choice of car window tint, place an led on the inside of the lens and put a heavy black or dark piece of material on top of that so you don't blind yourself with the led.  Visibility is pretty low because you would leave a small gap between the edge of the eye hole and the lenses to see out of, but that's just the nature of the beast when it comes to lighting up eyes."
cosplayers,3c8ed4,TR0N22,3,Sun Jul 5 21:32:14 2015 UTC,I think what you are looking for is best described as a gaucho hat.

cosplayers,3c8ed4,tucker_baby13,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:02:03 2015 UTC,"The texture on the second picture makes it look like it's pebbled leather.  I don't think the pic you linked will do it.  Those hats have a brim that's longer around than the crown of the hat, so it has a floppy wobbly look.  You couldn't lay it down flat on a table, for example, there's too much material, it would have a wrinkle in it.  It might be shrinkable, and you could starch it heavily to stay flat (maybe even put a wire in the brim, but it wouldn't be great.  The crown is too small to put that dent in the top, too."

I still got a pretty good number of photo requests even for my partial costume and I was able to startle Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy since the mid-80s, in an elevator. So.. there's that. :D  Next year he'll be 8 feet tall, the bandolier will fit properly and not fall off, and he'll be wired properly with a nice, loud wookiee sound system.

cosplayers,3buhj4,Tenkinus,10,Thu Jul 2 06:41:52 2015 UTC,You should get in contact with the organisers of the con. Because almost every con has different rules for this.  At some prop guns are not allowed at all. At some you need a clear safety marker at the muzzle. And at some cons they don't have any rules.
cosplayers,3buhj4,xDigster,7,Thu Jul 2 07:29:06 2015 UTC,"Dragon*Con Convention Policies   9. Dragon Con has a clear *no weapons* policy that will be enforced.  All weapons must be non-working and peace bonded. No functioning projectile weapons - including water pistols, silly-string guns, and ping-pong pistols.  Bladed weapons must be cased or sheathed at all times. No clowning around or showing off in the common areas. Any weapon used in an offensive manner will be confiscated and rule #7 [don't behave like a jerk] enforced. We expect you to use good judgment; with your help, we can continue to allow peace-bonded weapons - thanks!   So AFAIK as long as you pay attention to the spiel they give you at the Weapons Check table and give them the impression you're a reasonable adult, you should be fine."
cosplayers,3buhj4,AnHerbalGerbil,5,Thu Jul 2 13:47:43 2015 UTC,"Security will check them in upon entry. Mostly if the gun is an obvious prop/toy gun they won't worry too much about it. But if it looks realistic enough, they typically require an orange tipped barrel (which you can use orange tape for sometimes). If it has a moving trigger, sometimes they will zip tie it so it can't be pulled. And make sure if it has a magazine that it is unloaded (like in the case of the Airsoft pistols I use)."
cosplayers,3buhj4,TrueDragon1,3,Thu Jul 2 12:25:45 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned about the whole metal and wood thing. These are less plastic airsoft toys and more metal replicas.
cosplayers,3buhj4,TrueDragon1,4,Thu Jul 2 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Wood they would overlook, but metal they might have an issue with. As others have suggested, definitely contact the con and ask about it beforehand. Better to be prepared."

Only way I can explain it is going by steps, sorry in advance.  1- plastic tub filled with rocks, marbles, anything needed to make your desired imprints ( the negative/empty spaces ) I sculpted mine from paper clay, which worked great but was hell to remove after the fact out of all the nooks.  2- cover completely with the caulking ( paint-able cheap bathroom caulking ) and bang the hell out of it to get rid of bubbles  3- let cure for about a week since it's so thick  4- remove from bin, remove items and start trimming.  Trimming will take a while as it will seep into anywhere there wasn't something in the way. Paper clay allows for an immobile platform and will allow you to soak it after to scrape everything out.  5 paint  Good Luck!"

cosplayers,3bpdzp,CouchOtter,4,Wed Jul 1 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"When you post yourself on the internet, you are opening yourself up to the court of public opinion. Unfortunately its not always support and praise, as Im sure you know anyway - but dont let the lowest common denominator put a bad taste in your mouth. ;)  edit: And youre cute as a button. Some CC if W, though - your suit is a little ""short"", looks like. If you elongate the bodysuit up higher on your bust, it wont make you look so blocky. It will elongate your trunk and make you look longer/leaner, if thats what youre going for. It just may be a non-flattering photo or bad angle of the suit giving an optical illusion. Its not a big deal. People are dicks."
cosplayers,3bpdzp,CaptCash,5,Wed Jul 1 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"That was my thought as well. I've sewn cosplays for all kind of body types for friends and the most common changes are for torso lengthening/shortening in the garment or bust increase/reduction. Looks like you might be long waisted and the suit is more short waisted. It's a common thing for everyone in either direction.   A good tip for a bra, body suit, or corset is that the bottom of the cup should literally be directly up against the bottom of your bust. Gives more support and lift. This is also a really hard to find fit in one piece suits like swimsuits. Check out /r/ABraThatFits for a lot of really great info on this, and then be prepared to cringe when looking at bra catalogues because the rarely fit the models correctly.  And don't let mean people get you down. It's a really cute cosplay with a lot of fun details and you both look great.

cosplayers,3bok0p,Dildo_of_Vengeance,3,Tue Jun 30 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"When I was doing something similar, I did something like that this way you won't have to worry about seams or fabric unraveling, and you won't be too hot  Also, since you'll have multiple layers, you can probably wet your costume without making it transparent, so if you get too hot at the convention, find a bathroom, dunk your black top under a tap, wring it and put it back on, it should help a lot. (And in case you do that, having the metal layer that covers your breasts would make the operation less awkward)"
cosplayers,3bok0p,Kat-chan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:33:04 2015 UTC,Oooh that's a good idea! I'll look into whether I can find silver tops like that. Thank you!
cosplayers,3bok0p,Kat-chan,2,Wed Jul 1 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking of cutting your leotard that way, since you already resolved to sacrificing it... It's a form where even without a proper hem sewed, you won't have to worry about fabric unraveling showing on the exposed parts. way I see it, you cut the leotard just bellow the breasts, and remove the right sleeve, from the neckline or at the shoulder, your choice."
cosplayers,3bok0p,RockinHawkin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"OHHHH okay gotcha, I was thinking about the other arm! Thanks :)"
cosplayers,3bok0p,nanuq905,2,Thu Jul 2 06:02:46 2015 UTC,Cutting the arm off at the seam would not ruin the elasticity of the entire garment. I would recommend sewing it to the shoulder of your shirt but leaving excess fabric to cover the seam as if you were wearing a sleeve over your metal arm.  Make sure to pin everything that you are going to sew and I would actually take a short sleeve shirt and sew it at the seam where the sleeve meets the shoulder and then have the sleeve cover the top half of the arm and the seam. If you don't want a sleeve just cover the seam with something if you don't think it'll look good.  And use a Zigzag stich to sew on stretchy fabrics to preserve the stretch.

My costume was also pretty amateur and I didn't think anyone would recognize me. I was also nervous, but that all evaporated when I got out on the floor - as soon as you realize everyone else is dressed as crazy as you are, it makes it a whole lot easier and you start to relax some.   I also found it pretty liberating just being in costume in general - it's not like people are going to recognize you out of costume most likely, so it's kind of freeing to not be yourself and worry about your image. And the people who do recognize your character are usually super excited and kind about it, no matter how amateur you think your costume is.  Once you get going, it's a blast, and the worry just kind of melts away. (At least for me.) Focus just on getting out there and having a good time, and the rest follows! Oh, and remember to stay hydrated, take breaks, and eat food. Super important especially during the summer. It's easy to get carried away."

cosplayers,3bkz2c,xorf,2,Tue Jun 30 17:45:21 2015 UTC,Stepping outside of your comfort zone is kind of the fun part. My costume I wore at my last convention was definitely the least modest one I've worn so far and I was nervous but that disappeared almost immediately once I got to the convention. It was a great feeling.   Emergency kit kind of depends on the costume. Needle and extra thread? Touch up paint? Extra makeup? Sometimes hot glue gun makes it in. I cannot count the number of times random people at a convention have asked me for a hot glue gun (but I don't carry it on my person! Most of my stuff stays at the hotel room.)

Also, don't hesitate to go nuts, making frowny face when you're posing for photos, engaging in mock combat, all that is what makes the random person who asked for a photo stop on it later. The more in-character you are, the more people will notice you, and the freer you get, because at the end, it's not really you who has to deal with the attention, but your projection of your character."

cosplayers,3bhg3u,DancinFool82,3,Mon Jun 29 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"I've been developing a new application to aid in building costumes. I've been working on it for the last year or so and it's beginning to enter alpha.  I actually had the idea for this tool many many years ago. I kind of put the idea on the back burner though after I discovered Pepakura Designer. After using Pep for a few years though I started to get the itch to work on the tool again. There were just a lot of things about Pep that kind of bugged me. Some of them small like the lack of non-uniform scale. Some of them bigger, like not being able to load in multiple parts to see how those parts scaled next to one another.   With all these things in mind I set out to design a tool that was tailored more towards building costumes and try to solve some of these problems that were bugging me.  So here I am, one year later with a tool that has some of the initial functionality I was looking for. Some of the features in the current tool are:   Loading in multiple PDO files. Loading in and unfold 3d model files.  Save out multiple parts in a ""Costume"" file. Tools to translate, rotate, and cut/join unfolded patterns. Uniform and non uniform scale. Printing of the unfolded patterns.   I just released the second Alpha build which adds a mannequin that you can attach the costume parts to. This helps when trying to scale parts as you can see exactly how they scale in relation to each other.   Currently the mannequin only supports adjustment for the overall height but I will be adding additional controls so that all the measurements can be adjusted.  For more information check out my facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/TheArmoredGarage  The latest alpha can be downloaded here:  https://dl.orangedox.com/BGppuZp31xwJLeqiaT/Armorsmith_Alpha_0_2_4.zip"

You can water it down some and add fabric medium to it, but results will vary depending on what you're aiming for. But also pretty permanent, which I like.

cosplayers,3bgf4q,xorf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:35:03 2015 UTC,this seems like the best answer. Others aren't mentioning fabric medium. It's what will turn regular acrylic paint into fabric paint.

cosplayers,3bgf4q,xorf,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"From my personal experience: You can, but it will not last. Fabric paint has something in it that lets it cling to fabric. Straight from-the-tube acrylic will probably crack if substituted for fabric paint."
cosplayers,3bgf4q,Dizzymyfuture,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"If I were going to try this, I'd probably thin it (with acrylic thinner, not water) and airbrush it on. It will be a slightly fainter color but will be less prone to crack since it will tend to cling to threads and not fill the gaps as much as brushing it on at ""full strength""."
cosplayers,3bdwrp,Shadowclaimer,4,Sun Jun 28 08:20:43 2015 UTC,"I had a ton of fun today at Indy Popcon with my first cosplay, overall I met some absolutely amazing people and hung out most of the day with other cosplayers. Definitely an awesome side of cons I had never even thought would be as big and social as it was.  The sadder side of things is that this costume was absolutely horrible to wear (and finish building), at 3am the night before con I chucked the shoulders/shins/thighs in frustration (due to inability to bind them to the core armor well, they just weren't fitted properly, ALWAYS BUILD TORSO THEN SHOULDERS.) The armbands and bicep pieces are full not strapped in, so they literally were slid up my arms and removed all ability to move from me as well as causing massive heat buildup. My boots were also way too big (I put in heel lifts so I ordered them slightly larger, big mistake) which led to blisters and bloody feet.  For the first four hours of walking around it was a blast though, got pictures taken of me, met a ton of awesome people but the pain was nearly unbearable and I dumped the costume at my friend's booth for the last 4 hours and just hung out with people.  Advice going forward:   Plan for comfort, even a small sacrifice in the sake of that is substantial. Bring a spare change of clothes in case you decide to change out of your costume. Large bulky costumes without a ""home base"" like a car very close or booth or hotel room would be a nightmare. Build your costume so it can breathe, seriously, I heard this advice and thought I could survive and be fine but I definitely was not. Hubris is a bitch. Pin your cloth, I didn't do it for my cowl and it caused all kinds of problems throughout the day. Make it easy to tell wtf you are (by removing my shoulders I had no Targ insignia visible except my chest logo and my cowl liked to cover it a lot.)    Overall, I'd recommend heavy armor cosplays to other people, they're fun, you feel monstrous and substantial, but they're a hell of a lot of work and need to be properly planned. Do not wing it like I did. I keep telling myself I wouldn't do this again, but I'm probably lying, I might definitely give it another shot in the future. I'm very glad I brought it to a smaller con to test it out rather than taking it to a super long and busy convention right from the get-go."

I saw the cowl and went ""nooooo you're covering your only identifying marker"".   But always plan for comfort. Don't sacrifice your health and comfort for a costume if it's going to cause you harm. Don't give yourself heat exhaustion and don't hurt your feetsies.   Glad you had fun and learned a lot!"

cosplayers,3bdpos,Cabanaman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:26:29 2015 UTC,I've tried pva glue snd it's not gave it the strong layer I wanted but thanks
cosplayers,3bdpos,hoobs55,2,Mon Jun 29 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"it's going to be difficult to give a strong layer to foam while also preserving the texture. Best way to reinforce foam would be either smooth cast, a two part plastic, or fiberglass, but in order to get a sufficiently strong layer you would sacrifice the foam's texture. If you want to keep the texture, you would need something that would only lay on top as a thin layer sacrificing strength.  Either way, if you want to seal the foam, hard layer or not, it's best to start with multiple layers of either PVA glue or Gesso, a brand name for a sealant type material similar to PVA glue."
cosplayers,3bdpos,AnHerbalGerbil,2,Tue Jul 7 03:35:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice I ended up doing 2 coats of pva then 2 coats of fiberglass resin

cosplayers,3b6kqf,PlatinumAmphibian,8,Fri Jun 26 11:30:16 2015 UTC,It's really good first piece you have created.  When working with foam it's usually hard to get the surface really smooth so I would recommend using more layers of base coat and sometimes (depending on your foam) sanding it with a high grit paper to get it really smooth to make the cracking go away.  And defintely get some sort of filler for the seams and edges to get rid of the visible foam structure. But overall nice going. :)
cosplayers,3b6kqf,xDigster,3,Fri Jun 26 12:06:38 2015 UTC,"Dremel + High Grit (800+) sand paper is a dream, once I started using that I'll never go back. I made sure to sand every edge of everything, showing or not, just to be safe."
cosplayers,3b6kqf,Shadowclaimer,3,Fri Jun 26 17:27:49 2015 UTC,I must say that I am not a fan of the dremel. I prefer sand by hand because I get a better feel for the surface. But it's all personal preference.
cosplayers,3b6kqf,xDigster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yea to each their own. I have a battery dremel, light one.   I used Sanding Sticks for a bit though (Evil Ted has a nice video about them) basically just sand paper glued to paint mixing sticks, they were very useful."
cosplayers,3b6kqf,Shadowclaimer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:47:57 2015 UTC,I've been using multi purpose filler for the seams but I think I was a but too light on and cautious for my first one
cosplayers,3b6kqf,xDigster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:36:18 2015 UTC,The problem when using filler and foam is that the foam is hollow so worst case scenario it just sinks in to fill the whole cavity and not stoping where you'd like it to be. So always go one more round than you think.
cosplayers,3b6kqf,injuredimage,2,Fri Jun 26 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"That's a great tip, I've gone straight to a Boba Fett helmet so I'll use that tip this time!"

I used 1/4"" half round foam for the side details and mdf board for the fin.  I would recommend using mdf. It's really easy to cut and sand. I had a bunch of trouble making the lenses though. If you have any ideas let me know. I ended up using a brown plastic root beer bottle for the lenses."
cosplayers,3b61wb,Potatoeman,3,Fri Jun 26 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'd forget about putting real wood on it entirely if you want to be approved at a maximum number of convention prop/weapon checks.  I'd probably use a couple of plastic rings for the ends if I could find something the right size. I'd scout hardware stores. maybe you can  use the lids from a couple of 5 gallon paint buckets? You can buy empty ones at Home Depot, etc, and fix them together the right distance apart probably with a pool noodle or something like that to keep the weight down.  Then make a ""collar"" on the interior surface that's almost the same width using EVA and attach them as a place to anchor the stakes/slats. Then you could probably use a heat gun to get the subtly curved shape of the barrel stakes. It'd probably take some practice.  For a wood appearance I'd seal the foam (I'm told PlastiKote works well) and then paint the whole thing in a dark base layer of brown, then use dry brushing to add faux grain to it probably, in a couple of progressively lighter shades with progressively less coverage. It wouldn't look EXACTLY like wood grain, but I think it'd pass muster.  I bet somebody somewhere on the internet has posted a tutorial or two for how to simulate wood grain with paint."
cosplayers,3b61wb,MadeByMonkeys,2,Fri Jun 26 11:35:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I didn't really consider the possibility that real wood would make it unacceptable at cons. Thanks for the heads up, and for the extra tips on the foam!"
cosplayers,3b61wb,Cabanaman,3,Fri Jun 26 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"I made a very similar prop a few years ago for a friend and it's actually a great project for a beginner because the steps are straightforward and the result looks great.  Things you will need:   sheet of pink insulation foam 3/4"" or so wooden dowel cylinder roughly the size of your hammer (I used a cheap 5 gallon bucket) 2 small 2x4 squares a single Eva foam floor mat (can be substituted with something else, this is just a spacer) Craft foam sheets or aluminum flashing if you want to go all out    Cut your dowel to size (account for the length inside the bucket), then cut a hole the size of your dowel in the bucket. Push it in directly across to the other side then pop a screw into the top. Play with your new bucket hammer for a few minutes. Cut a strip out of the floor mat a few inches wide and wrap it around the center of the bucket. Maybe do this 2 or 3 times. This will cause the bevel that his hammer has. Measurement time. Measure the length of you're cylinder, then add in the thickness of you insulation foam x2. For example, if your cylinder was 22"" and you had 1/2"" foam add an inch to your measurement. You should probably add up to a half inch more just to be safe. Now use a string to measure the diameter of your cylinder along the foam spacer. Then cut a block of pink foam with these measurements. Figure out how wide you want each ""board"" on your hammer to be. After that, place the sheet longways in front of you and SCORE not cut lines the full length of the sheet. You can use a straight edge or freehand for a handmade look. Then, one at a time hold each board over the edge of the table and pop them away from the next. They should remain together due to the protective film on the back. If this part is confusing here is a video of someone using this technique to make a barrel. Have someone hold the foam while you duct tape either end. You should see the bend start to look like the hammer. You will have to carve a hole or alcove for your dowel. Cut a circle plug for each end of the hammer head. You can glue each side in place.   Finishing  You have 2 options here, a detailing and paint job or contact paper. Painting will be more durable and more complete, although more involved. Contact paper has the  potential to look great but could look cheap if done improperly.   The contact paper method is straightforward. Cut it and apply it to all the surfaces of the prop (before taping it down).  With paint you'll need to add detail. What I did was drag a nail down the length of the foam to stimulate a wood grain. Then do a dark coat of brown paint. Then a light dry brushing. You can even stain the dowel and paint the head to match.  After that cut strips of craft foam or flashing to be the metal plates on the hammer, paint them silver of they need to be and glue them over the duct tape."

It's great, especially when altering something because if you mess up on it you aren't out a lot of money. I always check ebay and amazon as well.   For contacts I would suggest honeycolor. Their shipping is pretty quick and they have an assortment of colors in regular and prescription lenses.   Adding years to your face can be achieved with makeup. There are tons of tutorials online about achieving certain looks. It might take a little practice but it could make a ton of difference.  It's not much but hope it helps!"
cosplayers,3b1d4u,Shadowclaimer,2,Thu Jun 25 04:29:20 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of doing a Thanos costume next year. In your experience, what's been the best way to mold eva foam and add designs onto it? Is there something I should avoid doing as well?"
cosplayers,3b1d4u,MrPint,3,Thu Jun 25 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"I used a mixture of various foams. EVA foam 1/2"" (in the form of industrial garage mats) was the core foundation of everything and at times even worked as detail to elevate areas. Craft Foam (1/8"") was the primary detail form. I would create a plate or piece, apply craft foam, then sand the edges together. When the seal (whatever you choose, plastidip in my case) is applied, it kinda brings it together a bit and makes it look really nice.  Details in general can be done with elevation of parts (adding craft foam) or removal of bits (cutting into the foam, sanding down, or heatgun tricks.)  I'd definitely recommend EVA foam overall though for a Thanos costume, its the perfect thickness and setup for his armor.  Things to watch out for:   Terrible sandpaper - This killed me, I dremeled all the edges of my first pieces with like 200 grit instead of 800, and the edges are ROUGH, the plastidip made the roughness look even worse in the end. Later pieces look amazing with 800 grit. Sizing - I used a duct tape dummy at first and it failed me miserably, so I made a plaster body mold. No matter how perfectly you think you stand still, you will make your body mold slightly too big and the armor will be large on you. Be prepared for that. Heel Lifts - Look into them if you're cosplaying a large character (like Thanos), it'll give you some added height and as a bonus tends to change your posture to be more imposing. Humidity is the Enemy - Anything spray related do not use in high humidity, everything has its own weird side effect in high humidity and rushing to finish it all during a rainy week is a terrible idea (I'm doing that now..) Time is the real Enemy - Get done at least a few weeks ahead of time. Even if you think you ""only have a few things left to do"", there's always shit tons left or errors to fix and redo. Thin Craft Foam Bends - Sparcely use a heat gun on detail craft foam, or make sure it is SECURELY glued."

cosplayers,3b1d4u,Sithslayer78,2,Thu Jun 25 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"1: DAP adhesive, slap it on both sides, let it dry for 10-15 minutes, slam it together. If you try to rip the pieces back apart it'll shred them, that's how you know that shit works. However it has caused me some issues where I didn't measure twice before gluing.  2: I'll let you know after I find one.

Wood glue works just as well (as long as you keep the coats thin to prevent pooling).

cosplayers,3b1d4u,Cabanaman,2,Thu Jun 25 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"Wood Glue has been a butt for me to work with lately, I tried using it with some sponge brushes on a few of the plates to even them out and keep the craft foam secure, and although it works to a point, it also just came out looking rough and was a lot of work to stay smooth. I probably could've had it a lot thinner.  I wish I had taken your advice from that earlier thread and tried watered down Elmer's glue."

cosplayers,3axdhg,rerelos,3,Wed Jun 24 07:01:20 2015 UTC,"Uh, though subject. So,   first, you take the picture you have of the sword and print it in the picture's real size (even if it takes several paper sheets), then you tape them together , and figure how many times it needs to be enlarged to be the real thing's size, you apply the picture enlargement, and print again, then tape the sheets together again (place the tape on the sword part) then you cut just the sword out with scissors and put it on top of your foam board, trace the contours with a marker then remove the sword picture, fold it and keep it somewhere you will find it later when you need it again. second, you place a dust mask or a cloth on your mouth and nose, or take the hoover to your workstation and use it to suck the foam dust as you carve, so you keep it all out of your poor lungs who didn't ask to be attacked with plastics particles third, as you said you're not crafty you take a pointy knife with teeth and start sawing at the excess board but at about a pinky width out of your out-shape so even if you mess up and slip a bit , you won't damage the core, when you're done, you take a (dozen of) cutter(s) and do it again, but this time closer to the line this tuto is nice for carving with a cutter example, even if it's expending foam third and half, if your foam board is as thick as the needed blade thickness, it's okay, just vacum your work to rid it of the foam dust, otherwise... well, you'll need to sand(or carve) it down to the appropriate thickness (of the blade only, you'll add the gold things over it later) fourth, you take the sword picture again, put it on top of your sculpt to verify accuracy, then cut out the sharp edges of the sword blade out on the picture, then put the plan back on the top of the blade and trace again first on top, then you turn everything around and do the same at the back (you will need to turn the paper with it's white side up for that), after that, trace the middle of your blade all around the blade (on the thickness dimension). fifth, you take your cutter(s), an do little ""slices"" of foam all around the blade (the cutter blade needs to be brought in perpendicular to both the top and middle line and cut down just until it bites the lines sightly, not more deeply, then cut at an angle to get rid of the matter (this process is better done from the tip of the blade and down) then repeat on the other side sixth(? not sure how it's written...), you take sanding paper, first rough, then thinner and smooth and ""sharpen"" your blade until it looks perfect, then round out the handle and guard the same way seventh, you take wood glue/mod podge/any other resin and coat the hell out of your sword several time with a drying interval in-between tip: if you had any missteps that resulted in a dent on the blade, this is the part where you fix it by mixing some foam dust with the glue and applying it on the indent, then sanding it back to smoothness eighth(?), you sand the glue lightly to make it grip better, then paint the whole blade silver, and the guard gold, the handle brown and don't care for more details right then. (acrylic pain has decent gold and silver, and it's often considered as the best) ninth, you take the picture again, and cut it down again to keep only the gold ornament   I won't say all the steps again, but you basically do the same as for the first time only twice and with an even thinner board, it doesn't have to be insulation foam, you could even use cardboard, and glue paper on it to hide the holes on the side...   I don't even know what number it would be, paint the gold thing gold and glue it on the blade (in it's rightful place, ofc, you can use the cut out remains of the blade to do that) paint the light and shadows with white and black mixed with the original color there is a tuto on that, wrap the handle, figure out a way to make the gem and pommel and varnish in multiple coats   ... I think it's obvious I got lazy toward the end? shrug whatever. Hope it helps"

cosplayers,3au0gx,OzSix,2,Tue Jun 23 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well, red LEDs, common batteries and a on/off switch is the way I'd go... There is a trick with LEDs as they only light if the electricity runs in the good way, so if it doesn't light up when you try it, flip the battery before doing anything drastic. (from my middle school days, I can tell you that you only need to run the wire from the battery to the switch, then to the LED, then to the battery again, and Tada! it works! The switch will work no matter where it is placed in the circuit, before or after the LED, so really, it's pretty basic.) The harder would be to find and understand the notice of the LEDs, but I'm sure there are small electronic shop, physical or online where you can get everything you need.  A LED normally doesn't die before years, as long as it's legs don't break, but even if it does, you just remove it and replace with a new one.  I'd personally have them almost single powered, each with it's switch and battery, especially if they are far from each other, but you can also put several on the same circuit, either in single or parallel line (pretty sure there are nice, neat schemas on how to do that out there if you didn't study it or forgot)"
cosplayers,3au0gx,Kat-chan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I had been looking at the little tape in LEDs that you use for like night-time frisbee, but it seemed rather more expensive than i wanted considering how many of the little buggers i need.    I will look into how to do the circuits and such!"
cosplayers,3au0gx,Kat-chan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"You don't need a whole strip to get a decent glowing effect, just some transparent packing foam to diffuse the light placed on top of the LED can be enough. There are a lot more affordable things on single LED"
cosplayers,3au0gx,silly_psyduck,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"LED light strips are expensive, but can be a bit cheaper from something like aliexpress, depending where you are (and they take a while to deliver). If you do go the strip route, you can get a longer strip and cut it to the right lengths you need (5m strip and cut yourself is cheaper than 5 1m strips), light strips will give you more light with less solder joints than individual LEDs, but more expensive  Either way, it's a good idea to mount your LEDs, wiring, etc. to something that won't flex. The more stuff flexes, the more likely one of your joints will break. Think about where you can run wires inside the costume if you plan on hooking them all in to the same power source, or plan to have battery packs nearby, which may be bulkier. To access in case of breakage, maybe attach the piece with the LEDs on it separately, so it can be removed and fixed if need be (i.e. have the disc itself be a separate hard disc, and then have it be semi-removable with the wiring passing through the costume to the inside)  Turning it off, as Kat-chan said, is easiest with a switch of some kind, but you can also have it just pop out the battery and that would shut it off too. You can even get battery packs with switches built right into them which makes things easy.  Individual LEDs vs LED strips depends on the effect you want. You can diffuse as Kat-chan said, but again, try to make that material removeable in case you need to fix it (better to plan on fixing when you initially make the thing than try to get in later)"

cosplayers,3ap1y2,ShotgunSenorita,3,Mon Jun 22 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"You can fix the ""flat on the face"" look by contouring your face! In this case I would use a lighter, yellow-toned green as a highlight, and a darker, more teal/blue-ish green as a shadow. This Homestuck makeup guide, while both Homestuck and using cream paint, has good diagrams of how to place the shadows. Place highlight on top of your cheekbones, across your forehead, and maybe a stripe down your nose. You can use more shades of your body paint OR even eyeshadow for this; I've contoured with eyeshadow in body paint before!"

cosplayers,3anp40,MadeByMonkeys,3,Mon Jun 22 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"You can take them outside and grind them into the cement/asphalt/whatever hard paved surface you have. It worked very well for a few costumes I needed to make look like the wearers had been in a 17th century prison for months, but it's not very precise. And you do need to be careful, especially if you're doing it on black asphalt, because that can get black marks on the clothing. Use your feet to stomp and drag the clothing, if you use this method, because it's rough on the hands.  But definitely think about which parts get the most wear. Wash them a bunch before you distress them, you want them to be as soft as possible. Fade out the knees the most, sandpaper would be a great way. Find a way to fold the pants so you get the distinctive creases where your hips bend, which you might just have to wear them a ton while bending and crouching to get. Leave them out in the sun for as long as you can, because you want the colors to fade."

Absolutely none of that stuck after a wash, not even a little tiny stain.   Dirt works fine if you seal your clothing. I prefer NuclearSnail's way of doing it with construction dust and latex paint.

For the dress, I think your best bet would be to find a long sleeve dress and add on the collar and cuffs.  Maybe a turtleneck dress so there's already a base there to easily add on the collar?  Here's an example of a lose fitting one, though it's not the right blue (you could always dye).  If you want one that fits a bit more snug (hugging your body), then look for ""bodycon"" style like this one.  For the boots, you can make covers.  I made some boots a while back with what looked like metal sheets covering them... I just painted some craft foam sheets and hot glued them onto some boots I didn't particularly care about lol.  They looked fine.  As for the make up, practice a lot.  :)  Look up drag queen tutorials - seriously, they are wonderful.  There are certain make up tricks that are especially useful to men, such as how to hide your beard shadow, and the drag queen tutorials tend to go over those a bit more.  Also, if you need help with picking out make up or even want tips, go to a place like Sephora or Ulta and just ask them.  They'll happily help you pick out make up that's a match for your skin and will probably even offer to do a makeover to teach you how to use the product.  They won't care if you're a guy - trust me.

Most of them are heat resistant so you can use curling/straightening irons if you need to. They are thick enough that you can style without worrying about seeing the netting underneath. My favorite feature is that they are not one solid color, but have mixed strands of light, medium, and dark so that the hair looks more natural.  Also, they have a youtube channel with really helpful tutorials."

cosplayers,3aab3g,MaxSupernova,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:59:26 2015 UTC,"Test a number of common solvents on a small piece of the rubber, and if it doesn't damage it, then try it on the logo.  I'd try, probably in order: denatured alcohol, acetone/nail polish remover, rubber cement solvent (acetone plus a few other things), turpentine.  They may leave the rubber a little duller than it was, but so will sandpaper so you're not far behind.  They may not leave any mark at all in which case you are far ahead.  The nitrile ones will be much more resistant to ill effects than the latex ones, so you should be able to find something that will take the paint off and not affect the nitrile. Good luck."

cosplayers,3a7o2m,Shadowclaimer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:35:41 2015 UTC,Craft foam/EVA Foam would easily work for this I think. Simply build up the box core using foam then detail it as necessary. The hard part I think is attaching it to your face.  It looks like what he did was a light attachment (spirit gum maybe?) then used cords from the back of it run over his ear to give it support.

When i was adding wear to coveralls for a Kaylee (firefly) costume, I took where the folds were naturally in the cloth and added the marks there on the ridges, as well as thinking where you'd wipe your hands etc.  Take a look at some of your clothes, and you'll notice where stuff usually wears (or if you can find photos that can help too)"

Play sand is a terrible idea though if it is actually a cloth, as it will never come out all the way."

EDIT - I'm pretty pleased that you bought it as Chewie's head on some dude's body, though!!

I store all my costume pieces in the back of my closet, usually on hangers or folded if I don't need to worry about wrinkles.   But, if I'm at college in my tiny studio apartment, my sewing stuff gets condensed down to my machine on a tiny folding table in the corner (though, luckily it's a solid wood top so it doesn't wobble when in use), any fabric/notions in a flat box under the bed, and using the floor as a cutting surface.

You could always commission someone to make the weapons for you. I will say, up until recently I had steered away from cosplays that required anything outside of basic props because I was terrified to make them. I'm actually getting ready to start on Jinx from LoL and it is really easier than it seems. There are a lot of really cool ways to make these massive weapons, and tons of videos on YouTube on how to do it.

cosplayers,39lc91,LolaFett,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:14:43 2015 UTC,you need only the green piece?  essentially it's a piece of plastic transparent green material.   a green Cast Acrylic will do the trick.

I drew on some technical stuff (engraving would have been the better choice) and attached it to one of these.

cosplayers,39lav8,Fenor,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't really consider Wonderflex because I usually do these things on the cheap, so I have never used it.  This does seem like the perfect application for it, though.  I'll give it a shot.  Thanks!"
cosplayers,39lav8,Kat-chan,3,Fri Jun 12 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe what you need is just a small sheet of worbla's finest art, cosplayers thermoform it in round shapes all the time. It isn't cheap, but many cosplay crafters only swear by it anyway, so it has to be a great material. You will be able to re-use the material you cut out by heating it up an molding it, then flattering it back in a sheet with a wheeling pin, or by using it as a molding clay."
cosplayers,39jjvh,TheOnset,3,Fri Jun 12 04:17:03 2015 UTC,"While Ive always done costumes my biggest focus/love is props, so consider that in my answers to your questions.   I use a lot of super glue (with kicker!!), and I have a love for apoxie sculpt. Styrene is also something I use a whole bunch. MDF is great and so is bondo filler. On that note, SANDPAPER. Clamps are worth a big mention. All kinds of clamps and the greater the number the better. Clamps clamps clamps. Razor blades, of course. Coffee. The coffee isn't for staining or anything fancy like that, but damn I go through more of that than sandpaper. While it's not really a supply, my dremel and its million bits are indispensable. Project to project it varies, but most of my projects use most of these things.  I go to a whole bunch of different stores. Home Depot and my local hobby shop are the two big ones though. I'm fortunate to live in LA where I can find a store that's reasonably close for any needs at all, including places like foam mart (for, well, foam) and Reynolds advanced materials (I make a lot of silicone molds) so I can't remember the last time I needed to look online.  The props! The rest of the costume is almost just context for the props, they are the biggest part of any of my projects. As for my favorite part about the actual making of, it's the problem solving. ""This part can't be that thin/long, it will break!"" Well, figure it out. ""How do I make this two separable pieces that look like just one?"" Figure it out! Planning for the known knowns, accounting for the known unknowns, and discovering, then addressing, the unknown unknowns is such an overwhelmingly large part of my enjoyment that I get bored at the end of a project because there aren't any more problems and I'm just going through the motions. Every prop/costume is practically just a vehicle for giving me problems to solve, and the end product is just a cool thing to have when I'm done.  I've never done makeup, so I can't answer that one.  I don't want to know. I really really don't. Some things take a few to dozens of hours, others take hundreds. I've thought of logging my hours but decided it's something I'm much happier being ignorant of. If someone who's into the hobby asks, I try to ballpark it. If someone else asks, I say that if I told them they wouldn't understand why I did it, and that if I knew then I wouldn't either. Time efficiency is great and I know that perfect is the enemy of good and all that, but I would always rather spend a stupid amount of time making something I'm truly happy with than pump out a lot of stuff which I knew could all be better. Though once I'm finished it takes only a few hours before I decide my new toy is crap and I have an ocean of things to learn before I'm any good, so I may be in need of a new philosophy."
cosplayers,39jjvh,KillAllTheZombies,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:38:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to respond so excitedly! Props are a big part of cosplay so it would be terrible to leave them in the dust. Any ideas you share are helpful to me and I appreciate it a lot. If my may further ask, do you lean towards particular brands of glues and paints for your props?"
cosplayers,39jjvh,MadeByMonkeys,2,Fri Jun 12 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"Hot glue, two part epoxies, silicone, so much silicone.  I think building a cosplay store is a super idea if you live in an area with a dense enough population to support it. If you're trying to do this in Alabama I think you're gonna have some troubles... ;-)  I also think that cosplay is so diverse that it's gonna be pretty hard finding a great deal of overlap that's gonna be enough to stock a store with. Worbla? Garage mats? Zippers and snaps? I dunno but I wish you luck.  Once you figure out the bulk of your inventory I'd recommend looking into Arduino/Adafruit stuff particularly their neopixels and FLORA/GEMMA/TRINKET/ETC wearables and tiny microcontrollers. They're not super expensive although they do require some minimal soldering and possibly programming skills. You could do workshops. It might help you stand out from places like Joanne's, AC Moore, etc.  Sorry for not answering in an itemized way. LOL. :)  As far as time... ha. I think I'm about 350 hours into my Chewbacca build right now, but it's probably more....  Things I can't get in my local craft stores/home stores and are probably used by lots of cosplayers:   Worbla all sorts of different thicknesses of craft foam garage and workout mats that aren't overpriced for tiny quantities a large selection of wigs or wig fibers (kanekalon) in reasonable prices different types of insulation foam (for carving into props) all in one store. Different thicknesses, densities, polymers, etc. Right now I have to go from store to store if I want different types as each tends to carry just one.   Things I'd like to see but probably aren't that useful to most:   Smooth-on and/or Polytech products like two part silicone rubbers for prosthetics and mold making specialized Dremel tips in large quantities all in one place like linen polishing brushes (oh and jeweler's rouge) Lots of airbrush paints and supplies instead of whatever fits into a 21"" shelf space at Michael's. Minitaire paints are especially good for cosplay in my opinion because they have LOTS of shades that are formulated with characters (miniatures) in mind."
cosplayers,39jjvh,MadeByMonkeys,2,Fri Jun 12 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. Worry not about the formatting, I kind of love it when people spew their ideas at me with such detail. My hope is that this place will be as much a craft store as a costume store. Michael's just doesn't cut for a lot of projects. Your input is super helpful. Also, 350 hours!? Go on and get some, that is a lot of hard work and dedication, I love it."
cosplayers,39jjvh,xorf,2,Fri Jun 12 13:40:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're going to have trouble competing on price when you bring certain things together. Like for example to get insulation foam at wholesale you're gonna need a purchasing account with a home supplier, but you'll be buying pretty much only foam and maybe some caulk or liquid nails etc, but not in huge quantities like Lowes, Home Depot, and so on.  Then for theatrical supplies, you'll probably do a bit better, but Smooth-on and Polytech don't give much of a wholesale discount unless you buy truckloads, and unless you buy truckloads, the shipping is gonna kill you, too.  Instead of competing on price, which is probably absolutely impossible, I'd focus on the studio aspect you mentioned and maybe have a makerspace style subscription to a work area and etc, or several work areas. Fume hoods!! Lots of insurance!!  I think this sounds like a struggle to be profitable but it sure sounds cool as heck. If you manage to pull this off I want your business plan so that I can do it here. :P"
cosplayers,39jjvh,Kat-chan,2,Fri Jun 12 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"Looking for suppliers is my biggest thing right now. It will be a smaller shop because of what kind of space is actually available, but the draw is the studio. So many people are short on space and equiptment. It is almost stifling for some. I want to carry as much product as I can, but the studio...that's the dream. I live in an art town with only Michael's to supply us, so I'll be reaching out to some other art mediums to help turn a profit. And who knows, those artist could provide insight in the studio that no one thought of. If all goes well in a few years maybe you can bust open my second shop :)"
cosplayers,39jjvh,MadeByMonkeys,2,Fri Jun 12 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"Supplies that would probably go over well or I'm just listing as they come to mind: foams (craft foam, floor mats, expanding foams, pink insulation foam), hobby woods (balsa wood, dowels, etc), various types of paints, sandpaper, dremel bits, razor blades, box cutters, exacto knives, maybe some buckles, D-rings, rectangle rings and the like. Primers. Casting materials, molds, silicone, resin, pigments. Hot glue, contact cement, wood glue, elders glue, superglue, spray adhesive. Masking tapes. Clear coats. Rub n buff. Plastidip. Electrical stuff! Small gauge wire, LEDs en masse, battery holders of differing sizes. More complex stuff like arduinos or micro arduino chips/micro controllers. Snaps. Velcro. Thermoplastics (wonder flex, worbla, terraflex from Tandy Leather maybe, friendly plastic)  If there is a local coslayer group in your area, it might also help reaching out to them for their thoughts. And if you're really getting things rolling later on, maybe you'll be able to set stuff up like workshops, demos, or they can have meet ups there. I obviously don't know how big of a floor space you'll be grabbing for this venture, but if there is also room to hang out and have kind of a maker space, I think that would be cool.   Wish you the best."

Thank you for helping me out."
cosplayers,39jjvh,msantamaria,2,Fri Jun 12 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't made lots of cosplays yet, but I guess the supply that I need the more quantity-wise is fabric. Vinyl, nylon fabric for a combat-suit look, spandex or jersey for the joints so I can actually move (there is no cheap fabric retail in my town, so I order it online, but it's not as good because fabric is one of these things you have to touch to know if you want it). If you are all level-friendly, consider retailing sewing machines on beginner and medium price-range, no need to have expert-quality without a specific order because cosplayers would look at these in more sewing specialized store.  For tools, there are heat-guns, blow-driers, curling-straightening iron, glue guns, soldering iron (for electronics, but mostly to work the foam) or pyrograph tool, aerograph, drill and it's accessories and cutters (be sure to have the corresponding spare blades too)  On the material side, Worbla is a safe bet, as is eva foam sheets or rolls, you could also take a look at friendly plastic, because buying the material (polycaprolactone) directly from the producer makes it half as costly as from creative brands, and it's another of these products you can only find on the net. There is also clay, plaster, paper, paper-mache, wallpaper glue, varnish, paints, gesso, screws, clips, buckles, straps, PVC or metal piping, chicken fence, metal wire, wigs and wig-care products, duct-tape, brushes, velcro, cardboard, foamboard, good-quality expending foam (used to carve weapons), latex gloves (so we can go to work the next day wit human-looking hands) and these transparent sheets to protect the floor when painting.  If you are making a workshop, consider having a ""kitchen"" set aside with burners, oven and microwave-oven, it's used to heat up some thermoplastic materials  My cosplays have not used special effects make-up so far.  My favorite part is looking up the materials on my chosen character and synthesizing it, drawing and planning my cosplay, and wondering what I will use for what part.  Hmmm, time... Can't have anything done under thirty hours, I guess?  how many stores I go to... seven, I think, and one of them is a caritative second-hand, so I have no guaranties I will find anything when I go. Then there are he online orders, to six different sites.  I think I would be ready to fork over 5 extra percents if I could have everything in the same place, and once I've established it is the best place and has reasonable prices, I wouldn't bother with the other places anymore and just go there whenever I need something, so your project sounds viable to me, I wish you the best luck."

Fabric is absolutely one of those things you don't want to have to buy without seeing and feeling it. That was one thing I was on the fence about for inventory, but it is just so important. Also, thanks for the brand name drop. The store is useless if I can't carry brand people like at decent pricing. Thank you so much!"

The fiberglass under-skull isn't very forgiving. I'm still struggling with the right amount of padding for the interior of the cheeks and the bridge of my nose. I finally put that aside and moved on which may have been a mistake because with fur on it's so much harder to work on the mask interior.   I'll post photos of that eventually. It's a combination of the suspension rig from a commercial hard hat and carefully shaped and glued craft foam. :)

cosplayers,39gn57,DawnPeters,2,Thu Jun 11 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say look into getting some sort of rigid acrylic/vinyl sheets and cutting them to shape, with overlap to avoid a big crease at the seam(s).

I find the finely ground pigment ""binds"" really well to the theatrical silicone skin that I'm using for Chewie's face under all the glued/punched hair. It will come off with water and some vigorous scrubbing, but under normal conditions it stays on great where paint and such generally won't. Pretty much nothing sticks to silicone but silicone. I apply it with a finger, or with a tiny paintbrush and some distilled water. I dampen the brush and dip it right into the pigment jar after shaking it off.  If you wanted to, you could thin some silicone caulk with mineral spirits and add this pigment (or oil paint I'm told works, too) and have a more permanent tint.

cosplayers,39b6cm,DawnPeters,3,Wed Jun 10 16:41:59 2015 UTC,The technique I use for ahoges and getting bangs to have some lift is a combo of G2B hair spray and a blow dryer (or patience).  I usually tease the base of the hair I want to go up and then hair spray the base with the G2B while holding the hair up. Then I either use a hair dryer to dry the hair spray or prop the bangs up so it can dry on its own. Then I repeat the process if needed or brush it out to make it more natural. Good luck!
cosplayers,39b6cm,PlayThatOcarina,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"I would use this technique plus maybe mold something like the shape of the hair (possibly just with cardboard) to leave it to set in that position.

cosplayers,39atei,GrimBrunn,3,Wed Jun 10 14:18:45 2015 UTC,"Paper mache seems like a big flake-off risk, but I'm not too familiar with it. I'd probably go for something like Bondo, if used just for texturing it should remain light enough.  You should be able to just sand the PVC with some rough paper to give it enough texture for things to grip to it. Remember to wear a mask if you do, breathing plastic dust is a nasty affair."
cosplayers,39atei,PlayThatOcarina,2,Wed Jun 10 15:08:41 2015 UTC,One of my friends makes props entirely from paper mache and it's very sturdy and lightweight if done correctly. Plus it's cheap to make.
cosplayers,39atei,Kinomi,3,Wed Jun 10 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"If you want a textured look, what about trying expansion foam over the pvc instead of a wire frame? I usually will use expansion foam to give a prop its shape and then you can paper mache over top of it. You would probably only need 1 can and once it's dry, you can carve it down to the shape you want! Good luck! :D"

I'm not sure how realistic/animalistic you're going for, but maybe try to fade out the color of your bottom lip so it's closer to your skintone?  And I don't know if there's anything else you can do around the eyes, so they pop a bit more. Right now it doesn't look like you used any eyeshadow or mascara.

cosplayers,397n18,pucciboimane,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:03:51 2015 UTC,"I know Punished Props was for some time selling Dragon Priest resin mask kits, it looks as if he's sold out now though. You may be able to send him a commission request for one and see if he still has the mold and can fit it into his schedule. Otherwise there's plenty of pepakura files around. Pepakura finishing guides are incredibly plentiful so you shouldn't have too much problem.  As for the weapons, Chillrend will be a lot easier, I could easily see that as a reinforced foam build. Whatever you choose though, keep them light and not-too-real looking for safety.  I'm not really to familiar with the world of textiles myself enough yet to help with the robes, but Googling robemaking guides and fabric weathering techniques should help giving you some idea what to do though.

The pieces are then are put together, they make the piece of armor.  It can then be left as is, or covered in epoxy and fiberglass, or painted with gesso (a clear glue-like paint) or paper mache'd.  If you simply google ""halo armor cosplay"" you will find literally hundreds (if not thousands) of hits on making your own armor, right from sizing it to fit you, through the initial cutting and assembly, to painting and finishing.  It will be a big undertaking, but if you're ready to put some months of work into it you can do it without too much worry.  Good luck, and make sure you post pics."

cosplayers,392uua,jellyhorn,6,Mon Jun 8 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Plastidip is something that I also tend to steer away from, due to cost differences.  I use a mix of glue/water to seal it rather than plastidip, glue is fairly cheap and water is cheaper, plastidip in Canada costs like.. $18 a Can and is just not cost effective.   Otherwise, yea that's the right order"
cosplayers,392uua,Kinomi,3,Mon Jun 8 23:30:25 2015 UTC,Well it really depends on how valuable your time is. The trade off with using glue and water is you need more coats and each coat takes longer to dry versus plastip which really only needs two that are ready in 30 minutes each.   Glue and water will take a couple days versus plastidip which will take a little over an hour.
cosplayers,392uua,hoobs55,2,Tue Jun 9 03:31:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like modge podge as my base over the EVA foam.  It's sandable and seals the holes so it takes less paint so overall, you get a much nicer surface finish."
cosplayers,392uua,disposable-assassin,2,Mon Jun 8 22:27:41 2015 UTC,"Mod podge, sandable? What kind of witch craft are you using?"
cosplayers,392uua,OneoftheZombies,2,Tue Jun 9 15:01:34 2015 UTC,I lay down like 4-8 thick coats.  then its hick enough that you can sand down the brush strokes.
cosplayers,392uua,disposable-assassin,2,Tue Jun 9 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"I will agree that plasti dip is really expensive, but I personally like the finish of it. Just be warned if you go that direction you need a rattle can sealant over top, most acrylic paints won't take to plastidip."
cosplayers,392uua,OneoftheZombies,2,Tue Jun 9 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"You don't actually have to seal EVA foam to paint it, it's mostly just done in order to improve durability and hide the texture that raw EVA foam gives. Unfortunately many of the sealers give their own textures that have to be dealt with too. Plasti-dip is flexible and has minimal texture (a sanded primer can hide it), so it's used a lot; the price is just a big negative for many. I've never liked PVA (Modge Podge) too much, it's heavy on the brush strokes and the harder versions that let you sand them out tend to be incredibly brittle. I've heard great things about latex, but I haven't tried it yet.  But yeah, as for your process. I'd defiantly say throw a primer in there on top of whatever sealer you use, and sand it down for extra smoothness (may need to repeat a few times). For hard flat surfaces, go for enamel paints, they come out much smoother and harder, and you can buy them in gloss to avoid the need for separate top coats. If you're going for a metallic gold, then I'd highly advise avoiding the metallic spray paints and instead use a metallic lacquer such as Alclad Gold, you apply it over gloss black paint and it gives incredibly realistic metallic effects. Also, remember to give your layers ample drying time, enamels especially, they can take days to fully cure."
cosplayers,392uua,GrimBrunn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:27:03 2015 UTC,"For what you're doing, plasti-dip wouldn't be that expensive. If you're in the US, it's totally affordable and I say worth it. Spray paint you have to be careful with, especially anything like Krylon because it dries almost like a layer of plastic? So if there is any bit of bend or flex, the paint will crack and chip.  For my stuff, I go Plastidip > grey primer > acrylic paints > clear coat. Also any weathering/shadows will make your armor pop.   Here's an example of a couple pieces I did recently and it shows what you can do with eva/acrylics! (the ones on the left were my first attempt 2+ years ago and the right was now)"
cosplayers,394aot,Jester_Helquin,3,Tue Jun 9 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"Which seam are you trying to hide exactly? The one that would be down the center? Just sewing it inside out like normal should do the trick for that.  Edit: If you're trying to attach the black and red patches around the eyes, you have a couple of options. Using the same color thread would make the most sense. Cons and photos, most won't be looking so closely as to see that little stitch. Or you could use a fabric glue. I am by no means a sewing expert, so take that for what it's worth lol"
cosplayers,394aot,_TYRANNOSAURUS_SEX_,2,Tue Jun 9 08:43:40 2015 UTC,"These sound like solid suggestions to me.  For the center seam you'll want to sew it inside out as stated above.  fabric glue or an iron on adhesive would probably work best for around the eyes, the only tricky part with the eye bits is that since the mask is stretchy you may have some issues with pulling/bunching, and that would be with stitching or glue.    My boyfriend was Grifter a few years ago and I used a double sided iron on adhesive, that you can get from just about any fabric store, to attach the eye parts of his mask."

cosplayers,394aot,Hayroon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:56:36 2015 UTC,Something that might help with the shape of the eyes is gluing a domino mask inside the spandex mask.
cosplayers,3913sz,CaffeinePowered,2,Mon Jun 8 14:06:33 2015 UTC,"This is really cool, but seems like a lot of work for something thats less effective then a pinked edge. Or a zigzag finishing seam which is easily done with a normal sewing machine."
cosplayers,3913sz,OneoftheZombies,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:41:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely right on the work part, Id only use this on any of the bigger seams or hem edges when constructing something before I got a serger.  A pinked edge is an easy way to finish something, but that also requires you have the right scissors. And on top of that its also not much help for fabric is prone to fraying, especially if you want something you can throw in the wash."
cosplayers,393mk0,kiji23,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"For the boots, making boot covers would probably be easiest. There's probably a handful of good tutorials out there."
cosplayers,393mk0,xorf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"True! Boot covers could work, but you are still left with what to do about getting that zig-zag look at the top without it drooping. If you can find cheap tall black boots at a second-hand store, you might be able to cut slits at the top and fold them in to make triangles and sew them together with a leather needle (regular thread should work fine depending on the boots).   I did that for a triangular cut-out in my Supergirl boots, and they stand up well. The boots might have to be snug on your calf, though, to stand up nicely after cutting that much out. But I think the weight might actually help it stay upright. Could be worth a shot, anyway! If it fails, they were only second-hand boots... so it should be a low-cost thing to try out."

cosplayers,38vqy2,Rachel5566,15,Sun Jun 7 06:09:48 2015 UTC,The lines look great. Try using a much whiter base overall and then apply heavy amounts of blush and eye shadow to get the colors to really pop.
cosplayers,38vqy2,The_MadCalf,8,Sun Jun 7 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"I second either switching to a thicker makeup and/or applying more coats; the white doesn't really seem to show all that well in photographs.  I LOVE how you did the lips, though! It really makes them stand out, and in a good way!"
cosplayers,38vqy2,gingeriiz,6,Sun Jun 7 06:23:17 2015 UTC,the white base needs to be more opaque otherwise its oddly not recognizable as Moxxi at first glance. Its a great start though.
cosplayers,38vqy2,VesperX,4,Sun Jun 7 06:47:44 2015 UTC,"In addition to a whiter face and darker blush, I would also consider drawing in the chin accent line. Otherwise the lines around your nose seem a little out of place.  They eyes look great, though! You're definitely on the right track."
cosplayers,38vqy2,indigosnowflake,3,Sun Jun 7 11:29:55 2015 UTC,"The lips and nose look great, the eyebrows and eye makeup look a little on the messier side though. Don't forget to use an eyeshadow primer if you're skin tends to oil up - the primer will prevent the makeup moving (especially in the creases). The pink makeup (cheeks, eyeshadow) should be brighter/concentrated, unless it is and isn't picking up with the light in your photos.  Not saying you have to, but if you want more arch in your brows, you can glue-stick them flat and paint over them (this will be less noticeable if you choose to go for the white powdered look Moxxi has). Then redraw them with a higher arch, alongside crisping the lines with extra concealer and a brush. Also, don't forget the big blush circles! :)  Over all, it's a great start!  Edit: So, I did a quick youtube search. I found a tutorial that shows how to use glue for your eyebrows, it has some extra stuff (like spirit gum and scar wax - probably unnecessary so don't really worry about that). But if you apply the same tricks with the glue to the outer sides of your eyebrows, you can move the arches upwards. Again, with white face-makeup (or even just white powder if you want to avoid silly halloween store grease makeup) it should conceal your real arch better. Here's the tutorial. Just thought I'd give you something to think about! :)"
