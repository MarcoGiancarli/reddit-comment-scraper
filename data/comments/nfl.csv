All these guys should've been on the team. But let's take it further....  No Ben Wallace, No T-Mac, no Ron Artest, No Jermain O'Neal, No Baron Davis, No Michael Redd.

nfl,3dxou3,eetsumkaus,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"The issue wasn't that we didn't use our best players that year (although it would have helped) - we created our team like an all-star team - we didn't put in the concept of team yet.  When the whole team is pure guys who just want to score, and could care less about defense and playing a team concept - that's what happens. Every guy on the team wanted to score 20, and not have to worry about defense - clearly we can't do that  So it was a combination of the World catching up - and playing team basketball that beat the US in 2004. If you lineup the Argentina roster (the team that beat the US in the semifinals and won gold) with the US roster in 2004 - it isn't that close talent wise - the 2004 US team was still way more immensely talented. But if we have learned anything about basketball in the last two Finals (Spurs v Heat and Warriors v Cavs) - teams win. You need players to fill roles, and no players on 2004 Olympic team had a role, Larry Brown never defined roles, therefore they lost.  I could continue ranting about the concept of team basketball winning (like how Euros are better role players than Americans due to the influence of AAU and how it is killing team basketball thus making the game worse) - but this is an NFL subreddit.  tl;dr 2004 Olympic basketball team was composed as an all-star team, not a true basketball team - therefore the World teams (specifically Argentina) could win on merits of being a team, not because they were more talented."

If the US was using pros, it would never happen, but for the US to send some of the ""scrubs"" to win by an average of 52-9, we'd have a chance to at least make the team, right?"
nfl,3dxou3,scrambles57,51,Mon Jul 20 15:14:47 2015 UTC,The guys playing for the US team aren't exactly guys picked up off the street. These guys played college ball and are pretty good in their own right.
nfl,3dxou3,redsox113,15,Mon Jul 20 14:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed, and that is why I put ""scrubs"" in quotation marks.  These are guys who can definitely play, but the rules of the IFAF are intended to severely handicap the strength of the roster.  One-year out of college, no D1-A (I think), no professionals of any kind, etc.    No doubt these kids playing can ball, but they're not the best-of-the-best by design, and if they're trouncing teams by 82, it makes me think I could sit on the bench for a South Korean squad that got utterly destroyed by teams that then got destroyed by the US."

nfl,3dxou3,antieverything,12,Mon Jul 20 14:20:28 2015 UTC,The Patriots practice squad would trounce a CFL All-Star team. Very few CFL players make more than the NFL practice squad salary.

Let me rephrase: a squad made up of current nfl practice squad personnel would trounce a CFL All-Star team.  Edit: just remembered that CFL rules have 12 players a side...so maybe a 10-man practice squad would have difficulty beating a 50+ person CFL All-Star team. You guys see my point, though."
