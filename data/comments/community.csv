If you've rewatched it probably at least two or three times and want to watch it again (and have like 60 gig in bandwidth to download it) check out www.chronologicallylost.com - some guy edited the entire show into chronological order, starts with Jacob and MIB being born in the first episode, ends in the church in the last episode.  Everything else is chronological so the plane crash doesn't even happen until about episode 23.  It really gives a whole new perspective to the whole thing and made me see things I'd never noticed before - like how Locke's dad got to the island and how time passed a lot quicker than I thought it had.    Can't recomend Chronologically Lost enough to lost fans planning another rewatch. (and the flash sideways stuff from S6 is added at the end so you can skip it if you want)"

I've missed out on that for way too long.  I recently finished Lost about 3 months ago? That was my 2nd(and a half, as I watched the first few seasons then got busy with things and had to restart). Alike Lost, so many shows are like that, it's absolutely wonderful noticing all the easter eggs etc and subtle details they may not have even intentionally added."
community,3dxub1,Nykoload,6,Mon Jul 20 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite little things from the rewatch was when Charlie is talking to Naomi for the first time, and he asks her if she's from Manchester, and she says yes and asks back and then he mentions how his band got their first gig at Night and Day on Oldham Street.   I'm actually from Manchester and regularly drink at Night and Day. It's a bit of a local institution for being a great and long lasting gig venue, and I thought it was actually really well researched by the Lost writers/crew to drop it in. They could have made anything up there, because it was inconsequential and 99% of the fans wouldn't have known, but they just put that little bit of extra effort in."
community,3dxub1,Fire_Bucket,6,Mon Jul 20 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well Dominic Monaghan is from Stockport so, I'd guess knows Manchester really well and probably added, or at least suggested, the local knowledge bits himself?   I'm sure the LOST writers would have had no idea to have Desmond singing ""For it's a grand old team"" when drunk, it's a reference the Scottish viewers would have gotten but 99.9% of other lost fans wouldn't have even noticed.  He's in a catholic monastery and from Glasgow so if he's gonna be drunk and singing anything it would be a ""for it's a grand old team"" a Celtic song... I'm sure they all add bits from their local knowledge to their character that needs to be reflected in the writing."

community,3dxub1,cgbrannigan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"I gave up on Lost a little bit after season 3. It kind of became clear that the creators weren't really sure where to take the show. It had been survival, was now sci-fi, and turning mystical, and then as we saw the last moment it settled on god because god is another word for magic (in tv terms, I'm not trying to insult people's beliefs) and it means not really having to answer questions and being able to hand wave solutions to problems created by bad story telling.  Lost had great acting, writing, character, development, and story telling, but it was terrible at maintaining a consistent story arc across seasons and that bugged me. And it had so much forced suspense through ""what's in the box?"" moments that I felt that I was either being manipulated all the time or the writers didn't know either. My favorite ""what's in the box?"" moment was the season cliffhanger with the opening of the vault. Practically a literal box!   This is the trademark of the JJ Abrams storytelling technique. Sometimes he nails it dead on because he's got a beginning, middle and end, but with Lost he only must have started with Season 1 and then an idea to go from there.  There's an interesting Ted talk where he describes how he likes to tell stories just like I described. So it's not like I was pulling this ""what's in the box?"" concept out of nowhere - it's one of his favorite ideas.  I respect it, but with Lost, it just annoyed me after a while."

Here's the quote:  ""You may have read that I am technically “signed on,” by default, to be an executive consulting something or other - which is a relatively standard protective clause for a creator in my position.  Guys like me can’t actually just be shot and left in a ditch by Skynet, we’re still allowed to have a title on the things we create and “help out,” like, I guess sharpening pencils and stuff. However, if I actually chose to go to the office, I wouldn’t have any power there.  Nobody would have to do anything I said, ever.  I would be “offering” thoughts on other people’s scripts, not allowed to rewrite them, not allowed to ask anyone else to rewrite them, not allowed to say whether a single joke was funny or go near the edit bay, etc.  It's….not really the way the previous episodes got done.  I was what you might call a….hands on producer.  Are my….periods giving this enough….pointedness?  I’m not saying you can’t make a good version of Community without me, but I am definitely saying that you can’t make my version of it unless I have the option of saying “it has to be like this or I quit” roughly 8 times a day. ""  You can read the full post HERE."
community,3e15cu,UAbuster,3,Tue Jul 21 09:21:24 2015 UTC,"Given a lot of titles involving ""executive"" are more often than not just buzzwords, it could be a way for the show to still keep him technically involved as kind of a fuck you to NBC without him actually doing anything. Or maybe its either a legality or ""credit where credit is due"" thing given the idea for Paranormal Parentage and a lot of other season 4 plots were Harmons from before he was fired.  Though I just checked the credits for History 101 and he's credited the same so I dunno, maybe its just a way to credit him for creating the show/characters or a legality thing for his successors to use them?"
community,3e15cu,dickpollution,2,Tue Jul 21 08:37:49 2015 UTC,"An executive consultant credit on a show generally refers to someone who is no longer involved with the show but who was heavily involved in its writing before they left.  It's different to a created by credit as someone can create a show and characters and then not be part of the writing room, however since Harmon was showrunner and leader of the writer's room for three seasons it's not uncommon for someone in that position to get an exec consultant credit because their influence is still very much there even if they aren't.  That make sense?"

However, it gives us some great Dean moments, a good few minutes for Magnitude, a killer Leonard line, and the return of Richie and Carl.  Barbershop subplot: Formulaic and predictable liar reveal trope played straight, but it gives us some good Jeff/Pierce bonding and a reminder of how good of an actor Chevy is when he wants to be.  P.E.E. subplot: Donald Glover crying, angry Shirley, Ian Roberts, Garrett, Neil, Vicki. Should be good. Not good. The plot is yet another sitcom trope played exactly straight, with the exception of the montage song parody ripped wholesale from South Park. And Donald crying only works a) when it's been built up and b) he's actually saying funny stuff while he's crying. Evidence.  Delta Cubes subplot: basically nonexistent, so who cares?  It sounds like I hate this episode, but the good (Jim Rash, Ian Roberts, Chevy Chase, the Magnitude bit, some great standalone lines) definitely outweighs the bad, which is mostly more disappointing than actually bad.

Heck, some shows/movies use theme songs in their shows (i.e, the Friends, Simpsons, Office credits themes are used in various other mediums) and are still counted as references as opposed to ""stealing""."
community,3dwi4v,vidiyan2857,-14,Mon Jul 20 07:38:53 2015 UTC,"Forget whether the song is popular.  Blank Space is quite popular, but that doesn't mean that gags about breaking out into singing it are common.  And I'm not talking about stealing the song. I'm talking about stealing the gag.  Like when comedians talk about stealing jokes they aren't talking about copyrights on product names in the jokes, they're talking about joke, the structure and elements of the joke.  Unless someone wants to tell me that a gag about breaking out into singing this particular song is a common gag, then it looks like this gag is a copy of the Community gag.

Can you list any other instances of this song being used as the basis of a joke of a person singing out of character?  You have a problem with me not liking this situation? Then maybe you're getting worked up over nothing too and you shouldn't be on your high horse."
community,3dwi4v,WolfVamp826,11,Mon Jul 20 07:59:41 2015 UTC,"Community didn't invent bursting out into singing.  So many shows have done that. So just because 2 pieces of media happen to use the same song while doing this common gag, does that make it stealing? Does using Kiss From A Rose somehow make the scene in Vacation funnier?   And no need to get defensive, I was just wondering why you were getting upset over something so strangely specific."
community,3dwi4v,GeshtiannaSG,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:46 2015 UTC,"Buddy, I don't think you really understand what a stolen gag is. All the Vacation scene has is just Ed Helms singing the song and then the real song starts playing as a way to make the boy and the girl he's looking at have a musical atmosphere.  Within Community, the song is used in a hostage situation, consisting of Craig keeping Jeff at the mall, Britta and Shirley driving a car with a guy who thinks he's Jesus and Pierce ingesting paint fumes.  There are barely any similarities between these, at all."

That being said, it's rare that a show has a uniquely cringy character and since people like that exist irl, I'm all for it.

community,3ds9gd,BobMugabe35,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:49:30 2015 UTC,I still have a bunch of episodes of Andy Richter and the live action Tick on VHS somewhere.

community,3ds9gd,BobMugabe35,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:28:03 2015 UTC,I think it's $15 on amazon

community,3dp2g3,claimempty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"I don't remember them doing any drugs on Friends. The episode where Ross smoked weed took place before the series even started, and even then he wasn't cohabitating with a woman."
community,3dp2g3,Leftieswillrule,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:52:57 2015 UTC,Haven't watched Friends. What's Schwimmer's fatigue?
community,3dp2g3,MephistophelianGuppy,2,Sun Jul 19 07:20:41 2015 UTC,I have to assume it's when one David Schwimmer character eventually wears a Jennifer Aniston character down over the course of several years to the point where she'll sleep with him.
community,3dp2g3,i_drink_wd40,-2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"David Schwimmer is the creator of Friends, right? I just got that joke."
community,3dp2g3,LearndAstronomer28,29,Sat Jul 18 06:46:21 2015 UTC,"im not sure if this is a classic learned astronomer goofaround, but schwimmer is Ross on Friends."
community,3dp2g3,ArmouredOtter,14,Sat Jul 18 07:54:45 2015 UTC,"It wasn't, I'm just a very confused person who has very limited knowledge of Friends. Thank you for the correction."
community,3dp2g3,LearndAstronomer28,0,Sat Jul 18 09:52:14 2015 UTC,I miss Shirley and Britta hanging out. Their conversations are always fun and they make weird gestures with each other.
community,3dqa6b,Hufflepuffins,2,Sat Jul 18 12:05:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's far and away the best episode of Season 4, and the only episode that season I enjoyed from start to finish - Jim Rash did a phenomenal job writing it. It still sits towards the bottom of  my list of Community episodes near the Buddy, Luka, Drug play, AAD&D, and Wine tasting episodes - which were all good episodes in a series that had mostly great episodes."
community,3dqa6b,TeamGreendale,8,Sat Jul 18 12:35:15 2015 UTC,"You disliked the Buddy episode? I LOVE that episode. And the Drug play is amazing, too. I agree with AAD&D and Wine tasting, though."
community,3dqa6b,PlainsvilleOfficial,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:49 2015 UTC,I didn't dislike it. It's just an average episode amongst great episodes so it's towards the bottom of my list.
community,3dqa6b,TeamGreendale,0,Sat Jul 18 19:12:50 2015 UTC,im disregarding ur opinion but i loved aad&d
community,3dqa6b,Therealslimshado,0,Sat Jul 18 15:28:40 2015 UTC,I'll disregard yours as well but I didn't love it.
community,3dqa6b,TeamGreendale,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:14:10 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I honestly liked it more than the original.
community,3dqa6b,Solnai,6,Sat Jul 18 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"Really? Not knocking your opinion, just curious why. I loved the original due to the whole Pierce story and how it added immensely to the character and the arc of Season 2."
community,3dqa6b,PlainsvilleOfficial,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think most of it is that I don't like Pierce's character as much as most people. And I like the sitcom-ness of season 1 over some of the adventure episodes of season 2 (like Basic Rocket Science).   Plus I really liked Hickey and I liked the challenge to Abed's plan. ""Will I go off your graph paper?"" I like the original, especially moments like Hector the Well-endowed. But overall I liked the season 5 one more."
community,3dqa6b,Solnai,2,Sat Jul 18 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"I really like Hickey, yeah, just wasn't a particular fan of the episode. Pierce is also my favourite character, so yeah, I loved the original Dungeons and Dragons."
community,3dqa6b,PlainsvilleOfficial,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:42:05 2015 UTC,Why don't people like the drug play episode? That's one of my favorites.
community,3dqa6b,AssassinSnail33,0,Sun Jul 19 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Did you read my post? I said the episodes were still good - just not as good as the rest of the series. I don't dislike the drug episode, but it's not one of my favorites."
community,3dqa6b,TeamGreendale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, let me rephrase that then. Why is the drug play episode at the bottom of your list?"
community,3dqa6b,AssassinSnail33,-4,Sun Jul 19 04:02:21 2015 UTC,Could you ask that again in another way?
community,3dqa6b,TeamGreendale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm probably the only one who thinks this but I hated this episode the first time I saw it. Jeff gets so angry for absolutely no reason and that really took away from the rest of the episode for me. On re-watching I can see the humor in the episode, but Jeff's rage remains a mystery."
community,3dqa6b,RogueNine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:18 2015 UTC,The Gag-Real tag is hilarious--it's one of my favourite end tags. So good.
