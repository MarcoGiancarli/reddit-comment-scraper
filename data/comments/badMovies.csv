This was taken right before he strangled u/ground0.   She said she spoke to him for a two seconds, he was cool, and then she saw Tommy run up Rocky Steps with two other people, did the mandatory celebratory jumping at the top, then ran down, then he and his friends headed back east on the parkway.   The end.  For this, I created an imgur account :P"

badMovies,3e0oxq,Schlock-or-Die,9,Tue Jul 21 01:36:37 2015 UTC,A while back this was a trending subreddit and there was an influx of new users who perhaps don't understand exactly what constitues a so bad it's good film.  Hopefully they'll filter out soon.
badMovies,3e0oxq,Spearow_Agnew,4,Tue Jul 21 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"The problem is, what some consider ""bad"" or ""the worst"" is subjective. Also, too many people confuse Cult Classics like Eating Raoul and Gremlins 2 and categorize it with absolute garbage like Oasis of the Zombies and Guru, the Mad Monk.  Then again, most people aren't as fanatical about movies as some of us."
badMovies,3e0oxq,RobopirateNinja,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:55 2015 UTC,Lately? There's Vampire's Kiss in the header.

badMovies,3e0oxq,aglidden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, we are still taking heat for sharing Johnny Mnemonic. I guess we'll have to keep defending it. While it (clearly) isn't the opinion of the majority of users here that JM is a good bad movie, we really really really felt that it stunk. And we mean 4 out of 10 bad when considered against ALL movies for its film-making and story-telling qualities; thus making it ""bad"" (in our eyes). However, we all completely loved it for its sheer ridiculousness, awful acting, pointless sequences, horrendous one-liners, cheesy effects and ill-begotten plot and script. Thus making it a ""good"" bad movie in our eyes. Lastly, we do have a bad movie podcast and would like users here to know it exists and to join us in the discussion, so sometimes we share movies from episodes we do. We typically only do this when something is ""required viewing"" for bad movie lovers, ie Stone Cold, Deadly Prey, The Wicker Man, OR if something may be a little forgotten about and is available for viewing and freely on YouTube. I personally hate when people post a trailer to some film on YouTube and only really click on links that have the words ""FULL MOVIE"" in the title, so I followed the Golden Rule with JM. So fully defended and I will discuss it no more.  I think the primary problem here ISN'T that we all have different opinions of art and film. That's human, and is why discussing art is important. The hard thing is to define what a ""good bad"" movie is. You first have to determine if a film is bad and then if you like it. Well if you like it, then is it bad? For instance, take Deadly Prey. It's terribly made yet there is a story that is interesting and characters that you genuinely care about. So then is it still bad? No, when compared to films such as Godzilla (2014). From a technical aspect, there was nothing wrong with Godzilla. The direction, acting, editing, and effects were all competently done, but it is a truly awful experience because of how little you care about what is happening on screen. Not having it be about the titular character doesn't really help either. So then it's bad and should be discussed here, right? No. It's not worth viewing in any manner.   JM, Gremlins 2 (et al), may be mainstream and not obscure enough to really make all people happy. Which is fine. But sometimes these films become obscure because we forget about them over time. I would stand by that Gremlins 2 stinks on ice and is worthy of being reminded about by another user here. I, for one, would be saddened if I knew that someone wanted to recommend it but felt they shouldn't because it wasn't made by AIP or Corman.  I will always remember that I am a guest here and if something is not appropriate then I will avoid it. But that decision should come from mods, not downvotes. Sorry, but downvotes are guides and let the OP know what users care for, not what they shouldn't post. That's the mods jobs.  By the way, the Bible called and said I am too wordy. Sorry for the long comment!"

Those generally have low scores, there are exceptions, but very few. Good bad movies definitely do not have scores in the high 6's and 7's."
badMovies,3e0oxq,stinkermadness,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:24 2015 UTC,"Schlock-or-Die, I think you have terrific taste in bad movies, so this comment comes with absolute respect. But I can negate this argument - Road House has a 6.4 user rating and was nominated for 5 Razzies. Roger Ebert gave the movie 2Â½ out of 4 stars and commented that ""'Road House' exists right on the edge between the 'good-bad movie' and the merely bad. I hesitate to recommend it, because so much depends on the ironic vision of the viewer. This is not a good movie.""  Flash Gordon (also Razzie Nominated) has a 6.4 as well. Death Race 2000 has a 6.2, Bad Taste a 6.8, Deadly Prey a 6.0, and this subs favorite Miami Connection a 6.1. While not in the high 6s and 7s, they aren't all bottom feeders either. Loved films get high User scores (as they should) on IMDB. Perhaps metacritic is a better example to stand by?"

badMovies,3c59vp,Goose511th,2,Sun Jul 5 09:30:43 2015 UTC,"Rule 1 is always, Be Sincere. It's why movies like Troll 2 are so drop-dead hilarious; the movie lacks any self-awareness, which is what puts it over the top to so-bad-it's-good territory.  Making a purposely bad movie like this misses the point entirely. But, to each his own I guess."

It's just a way to aproach movie making I do not like. It can work out to make something a little more cheesy or to be self-aware, like in Planet Terror, Hobo with a Shotgun or Father's Day.

badMovies,3c3qms,Curse-10,9,Sat Jul 4 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"There's a fine line there. Zoolander is considered a good movie, because it has been well received by both audiences and critics; same thing with movies like The Iron Giant, which bombed hard when it was released. Hollywood movies aren't necessarily ""good,"" though. I think we can all agree that a movie like Nick Cage's The Wicker Man is terrible.   When looking for good bad movies, though, try to look past even box office bombs and look for b-movies and movies with low production values or just poor direction. Directors like Coleman Francis or Uwe Boll are some of my favorites, but that's just skimming the surface."
badMovies,3c3qms,curtan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a blatant yes/no thing. The Big Lebowski and Dredd and Blade Runner didn't exactly perform at the box office, bit did find a big welcome in the home market. These are objectively good movies that for whatever reason didn't get the box office following that came with their dvd/vhs sales.  Compared to Waterworld, Ishtar, and Zardoz. These were Hollywood mainstream movies. But fell so hard on their face that they now have a home video presence (cult following) because of their failure. I'd also include in this category Hudson Hawk, Speed 2: Cruise Control, Battlefield Earth, Howard The Duck, and plenty of others."

It was the perfect balance of gritty crime noir and comic book action movie. There was not a single moment of that movie where I was not highly entertained.
badMovies,3c3qms,p_velocity,2,Sat Jul 4 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not even the point of the thread man.  And besides, different people have different tastes.  Maybe the OP hates gritty crime noir?  Maybe they hate something else about it?  That's just their tastes, and there's nothing wrong with that."

badMovies,3bybgd,tomdelfino,2,Fri Jul 3 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"Man, this movie just sounds bad. I wish I had stumbled across your post earlier so I could've had time to watch it before bed!"
badMovies,3bybgd,w4z,3,Fri Jul 3 05:35:24 2015 UTC,The characters are all sterotypical with bad acting and bad fake beavers. But the people becoming zombeavers themselves just puts it over the top.
badMovies,3bybgd,Ahojlaska,2,Fri Jul 3 06:56:03 2015 UTC,First 5 minutes has Bill Burr.  I watched the whole thing for that reason.  Spent most of the time wondering what planets aligned for him to be in the movie.
badMovies,3bybgd,fknrat,12,Fri Jul 3 09:00:59 2015 UTC,"I wish these kinds of movies would go away.  Some of them are kind of funny (Ghost Shark), but I mean...they're supposed to be bad.  Everyone in them knows they're bad.  It's the point.  It seems to defeat the purpose of a bad movie."
badMovies,3bybgd,Rohaq,10,Fri Jul 3 09:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ""we're in on the joke"" movies don't seem to qualify for ""bad movie"" status since they're trying hard to ape the b-movie style. Part of the charm of a typical bad movie is the earnestness underneath where the filmmakers truly believe they're making something top notch but their execution shows how far off the mark they are."
badMovies,3bybgd,RobotBuddha,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:50:34 2015 UTC,"One of the things I liked about Ghost Shark was that the actors seemed really serious about it. Like the opposite of ""We're trying too hard to be hilariously bad"". A friend of mine deceived it as ""It never winks at the audience"", and that was what made it entertainingly terrible.   Compare it to say, Kung Fury, which was pretty good in its own right, but the number of obviously silly tropes made it seem like it was trying a little too hard at times."
badMovies,3bybgd,untouchedURL,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:19:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of them. But I don't think zombeavers is one of them. I think it's a legitimately good movie. There's none of the winking at the camera you see from most of the ""trying to be bad"" movies. It's obviously shlock, but I never got the impression that the actors were really trying to ham it up or anything."

And because it seemed to have used real participants from a traditional harvest festival. And because there were no supernatural phenomena.   I heard the remake was terrible and wanted to compare. And I love crappy Nic Cage vehicles. To be honest, it wasn't that bad. Just a bit disjointed, relying more on cheap scares and supernatural happenings and Hollywoodized. The only weird thing was when they literally re-shot scenes from the original, but without it's context."

One would think it would be available somewhere by now, and I've been F5'ing every place I can think of at least once a month since I heard it was shown in theaters. My leading guess is that it's actually a big hoax and everyone who ""saw it"" really were incepted into thinking they saw it, but just looked at a blank screen."

Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are always good, and Telly Savalas as the  Cossack officer that joins midway through to investigate the horror is pretty over the top in an entertaining way. Certainly not a ""good"" movie, but one that is well on the entertaining end of the B-movie horror spectrum.   The Matt Elliot Rifftrax is also rather good, especially for a solo effort, though as I've stated elsewhere he has a different him out style than the MST3k guys, so I wouldn't recommend it without that caveat."

And as the title suggests, an unstoppable Death Machine robot!   save Exterminator City for last.   Oh boy.  Yea, this is really one of the absolute worst waste of film ever.

We were split up at birth, he went to live with his foster parents in a rural town, whilst I was raised in the city, as the daughter of two upper class people.  Chance brought us together when we were in our early twenties, and we hit it off well. We went through a great deal of adversity together (unrelated to our relationship) and though we never consummated our love we did share a passionate kiss.  However, fate moved us on. We both lost interest, and I fell in love with his colleague, eventually marrying him. As I reflect upon my current relationship, I can't help but wonder what could have been. My husband, though wonderful, is a less-than-savory man - he currently works as a smuggler, and his best friend is an illegal alien.  Ultimately, I know it was never to be, but I dream of him - my knight - rescuing me, the princess.  Is my silent resignation the right attitude to take? Or should I dare to rekindle our once burning flame?  Regards,  Leia"

I enjoyed the first 2 movies to an extent. 1 was a pretty unique idea and I felt it was just ridiculous enough to be pretty good. 2 was just straight up torture porn, but definitely had some good cinematography.   As for 3, there were definitely moments within the first 20 minutes that I almost turned it off, but hey, I paid $6.99 for that motherfucker, so I was going to sludge through. About 30 minutes in I caught myself laughing pretty hard at the sheer ridiculousness of Dieter Laser's terrible accent and constant screaming. Ultimately by the end of the movie I was pretty disappointed by the actual reveal of the centipede. I did crack up at the caterpillar though.   Was it a good movie? Not at all.

Honestly, I felt like Tom Six just told him to go fucking nuts on camera - no set script or anything. I feel as though every other aspect of the film is just a detriment to his performance. I guess it's a guilty pleasure thing, but I enjoyed Laser - it reminded me a little of Tim Curry in IT."

badMovies,398k58,Ragnar_OK,2,Wed Jun 10 09:52:56 2015 UTC,"After my first viewing, I certainly wouldn't describe it as boring. Painful to sit through? Maybe a little (like a car wreck), but overall I found it kind of fascinating and, well, really bad.    The jokes are so obvious that they become painful   Right? It's really bizarre (but, again, fascinating) to see two of the best comedians of that era fall flat with every single joke and setup. And the plot/character development/comic devices? I would argue that they're all equally as bad, and it makes me wonder how the script was green lighted.   I totally understand your perspective. But even though I realized how bad it was within the first 15-20 minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off of it as it devolved even further as it went along."
badMovies,398k58,pike360,2,Wed Jun 10 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"Well, for me, it was painful to sit through because it was a failed comedy - nothing sucks quite as bad as continuous failed joke after failed joke. I can sit through something like Manos, even though it's objectively an insanely boring movie, because it's unintentionally hilarious / entertaining, but a failed comedy can't even make me laugh, just cringe at how terrible it is.  It's like the ""veneer"" of so-bad-its-good movies, that makes those enjoyable, disappears when I have to deal with a bad comedy. My least favorite movies, that I just can't stand watching, are all terrible comedies."

badMovies,394wwi,Ragnar_OK,21,Tue Jun 9 07:43:20 2015 UTC,"I saw it yesterday, and this movie is fucking amazing, right up there with The Room and Birdemic. Every other scene, you can't help but go ""bahahaha jesus fucking christ"".   Among the many amazing scenes, we have a 10-odd minute scene of a discussion between 3 FIFA officials about a match between Ukrainian POWs and Nazi officers, which ends with one of the officials praying in a church while, what can only be described as, the light of God shines down upon him, as he suffers personally at the injustices throughout the world. The dialogue is amazing too, containing lines such as: ""On one side... highly trained German officers... On the other, these poor, starving, Ukranian prisoners taken out of a factory! And in the middle... a CORRUPT referee following the German's orders...""  One of the other officials in the room, in a hushed tone: ""A death match!""  There's another scene (set around 1930) wherein a foppish, snobbish englishman chastises a young woman for suggesting that the ""Zulu nation"" could host a world cup, scoffing at the idea, and following up with ""what's next, women playing football?!"" Honestly, the way they're portrayed, I'd say the main villain of the movie is The British.  Did you know that, according to this movie, World War 2 could have been avoided if only major nation leaders had listened to FIFA? You see, FIFA was the first one to figure out Nazi Germany was rearming, and it was a handshake between Hitler and Mussolini at a soccer match between Italy and Germany that gave it away to the then-current FIFA officials!  The casting in it is tremendous too, whoever cast this movie follows the Uwe Boll school of movie-making. Sam Neill playing a Brazilian, doing a fake portuguese accent... comedy gold. His accent slips up about every 3rd sentence.  When Havelange gets elected as president of FIFA, the scene plays out like the ending of A New Hope, with the medals and whatnot. If somehow The Emperor could have been there to scowl at Luke disapprovingly, it would have been the British FA president in the crowd. The Brits are basically pure evil in this movie, they have 0 redeeming qualities, and are so insanely over-the-top that whenever they're on the screen, it's absolutely hilarious. In fact, the movie just straight up blames Great Britain for hooligans, they just straight up say ""it was the british's fault that we have hooligans, 100% no doubt undisputable fact forever all the time always great britain is at fault"", basically.  There are so many great scenes in this movie, I want to tell you about all of them, but there's too much to write, and I don't want to spoil it too much anyway...  Sepp Blatter, who just resigned amidst an investigation for corruption by the FBI, is presented as a young, bright idealist who disapproves of the more shady going-ons at the top end of FIFA. He cares about the sport, you see, and he wants to be there for it, to nurture it and grow it. He wants to deliver on the promises of his predecessors, and the old guard will hate him for it, but alas, he needs to bring this change to FIFA, he will be the great uniter!  Sepp Blatter, this Kwisatz Haderach of the footballing world.  They go into full montage mode, complete with 80s upbeat poprock - montage of Blatter signing contracts and football matches being played throughout the world, stadiums being built, world cups etc.  A woman's football match, blatter is walking in the background. A bunch of architects looking up and pointing a newly constructed stadium, blatter is right up there with them, pointing like a motherfucker. A world cup ceremony, sepp is presenting the award. Then he's in the office, signing deals and bringing football to the people some more.  And it goes on like that for two whole minutes.  Blatter, of course, is a visionary who fights corruption at the top levels of FIFA, while his name is dragged through the mud by those same corrupt parts! As exemplified by the dialogue between Blatter and two of his aides in one scene:  Person A: ""You've been betrayed..."" Person B:""Yes! By the same people you've put in power!"" Blatter: ""sigh It's ironic..."" 10 seconds of silence  And, of course, the movie ends with FIFA awarding the 2010 World Cup to South Africa, presented as a great reunification moment, how FIFA managed to bring the sport back to the people! Yeah... about that..."

badMovies,38rdup,23infinity,4,Sat Jun 6 10:18:35 2015 UTC,"""Over the top batshit crazy"" is pretty much the exact way to describe this movie. It's a bad movie but not for not trying. Which is why it's so fucking incredible. It's a movie the likes we will never see again from a mainstream hollywood development.  Keeping in mind. This scene is just how the movie starts. Starts. It will only continue to go further and further down the rabbit hole. Sadly I can't find a clip without commentary, so that's going to have to suffice.  Thankfully it is now re-released on bluray. Unfortunately they do this 'limited release' thing and jack up the cost. Actually I should see about ripping my copy onto the computer and try to upload a couple HD clips to Youtube to share."

badMovies,3894qj,Meph616,2,Wed Jun 3 13:59:09 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Things. It's garbage, but you can see that it's people with $0 budget trying their best to make a movie. And we indeed got their best. It's a movie you enjoy a lot out of schadenfreude, in a similar manner to how you enjoy The Room or Troll 2. These people weren't trying to make crap. They just did. They put actual effort into their goods and it crashed spectacularly. Plus it's truly fascinating to watch from a technical point of view, wondering why they did what they did.  FDR:AB is however like Iron Sky. It just tries so fucking hard that it's annoying. It's self aware in a bad way, from the start they know it's a ridiculous premise and they all ham it up so f'n horribly.   If you want a B-movie with a President in it for your event I'd have suggested Bubba Ho-Tep."

badMovies,37nx3y,koiboy,8,Fri May 29 05:38:55 2015 UTC,But it's done in the spirit and aesthetic of a bad movie.  So awesome that they released it for all to see freely.
badMovies,37nx3y,thekeanu,4,Fri May 29 06:16:31 2015 UTC,"This missed the mark for me.  It felt like the kind of thing made by people, and for people, who like to talk about how cool B grade 80s action movies are, but don't actually watch them.  Sorry that's how it felt to me, it just hit the obvious cliches.  I say that as someone who, for better or for worse, has sat through hundreds and hundreds of terrible 80s action, has been a member of Cinemageddon for five years, and is genuinely not proud of the amount of trash I have wasted my life in front of."
badMovies,37nx3y,hepheuua,9,Fri May 29 08:16:37 2015 UTC,"I see it as fully a fun extension of what people thought were the most fun of those B grade action movies and nostalgia etc.  Similar to how bombastic and exaggerated Far Cry Blood Dragon was or how brutal and adrenaline filled Hotline Miami was, all with a shared aesthetic.  Not sure if you actually lived through the 80s, but I was a kid at that time and I like Kung Fury a lot. Just like how Blood Dragon wasn't actually how it all was back then, it's a fun reinterpretation including new ideas and technology and they're both brimming with that weird dark energy and super neon offset.  I even just flat out like the audiovisuals of Kung Fury.  At minimum it's just using the aesthetic of those times for new content which I fully support.  I mean, look at how crazy people go with old filters in their photos - they're not necessarily trying to pretend that's how it actually was back then - there's a trigger of nostalgia even for people who never lived in those times and at minimum it can be flat out interesting, if contrived and predictable and off the actual mark.   At the same time I can understand why people might not like it. Maybe people are turned off by the try-hard nature of cramming all the nods to pop culture and cliches like you mentioned, or maybe it's just too corny on its own even without that etc."
badMovies,37nx3y,thekeanu,3,Fri May 29 08:59:06 2015 UTC,"A fair response and well articulated.  You gave good support for a perspective I'd kind of thought of but hadn't really appreciated.  Even people who might not be familiar with the source material can dig the result of it.  And I agree, it's a different thing in its own right."
badMovies,37nx3y,hepheuua,2,Fri May 29 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it honestly wasn't very good. The overall story and writing was kind of shit and it relied too much on being over the top and random to get laughs. Everything felt disjointed and thrown together to try to form some overarching story that gave an excuse for all the 'totally '80s' stuff that people mistakenly seem to think happened in '80s movies all the time. It's also completely obvious how much of it was done in front of a green screen, which is not at all in the spirit of inventive and practical effects, which were a big part of the '80s (at least to me they were)."
badMovies,37nx3y,MagnaFarce,3,Fri May 29 08:44:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't think they made a ""deliberately bad"" movie, like Iron Sky or Poultrygeist. They made a hyper-stylized love letter to the 80s. Every single* stupid 80s movie trope is in there from the police chief yelling at him and then KF quitting, to shitty exposition that is never given a second glance or questioned. And the one liners. The cheesy macho one liners.   It is ridiculously over the top, but being over the top is not the same as bad. It's not bad like with Tommy Wiseau trying to make a drama and we all gather for collective schadenfreude. And it's not bad like the garbage from The Asylum, which uses the ""made bad on purpose"" schtick as an excuse for making cheap halfassed garbage to fill a timeslot on SyFy.  I think this kind of fits into a tiny niche category, the whole hyper-stylized yet still made with genuine intent. Like... hmmm. Like Punisher: War Zone (sidenote: fuckin love PWZ). Lexi Alexander didn't direct the movie to be bad, or fake-bad, she made it to be ""ridiculous"" in the sense that she wanted the action to not be so realistic that it's influential to youth. To be a balls out insane rollercoaster. And it works on that level, it's so far gone from the traditional models that they're in their own little world.  *Not literally every single one"

I already knew the comedy was cheap, the actors were poor and the plot was... a plot. In my opinion the weaknesses of this movie was it's strength, since it doesn't take itself seriously.  Two real complains I have with this movie is that the movie was way too short and hastened, and with several lost opportunities of expansion. I can also spot some content in the trailer which was probably dropped later in the production. The other complain is that the trailer was basically the whole movie, and all the moments that even reminds me of tension/anticipation was already spoiled by the trailer."

badMovies,37dgy9,Rasalom,1 point,Wed May 27 12:04:51 2015 UTC,I loved Dead Heat and gave it the number 8 (of 10) spot in our Year in Review http://www.stinkermadness.com/episodes/entry/podcast-episodes/year-1-year-in-review-part-1 from all the bad movies we watched last year.  My favorite part was when Treat Williams character used himself as a missile off the motorcycle and then him and another zombie shoot each other with about 700 rounds.  Classic.
badMovies,37dgy9,stinkermadness,3,Wed May 27 19:56:51 2015 UTC,My favorite part was Joe Piscopo dying off-screen. My least favorite part is when he showed back up.

badMovies,36y9wi,thegalorian,4,Sat May 23 03:25:09 2015 UTC,The mother sounds like she spent about 40 years in Vegas shoving as much whiskey and cigarette smoke down her gullet to get such a stunning voice.  And the fembot sister must have taken the Dr. Acula acting class before landing this roll.  edit  Holy fuck I just realized... is this movie the inspiration for Stuart? They look like brothers.

Come visit /r/fullmoviesonyoutube so you can get examples of the new anti-piracy schemes. Movies with the altered tag either have the dark with bright center or have changed pitch or speed

badMovies,36n2ez,MansTrueNature,0,Thu May 21 09:56:21 2015 UTC,Is there any work-around?  Why would YouTube not just take down the video rather than altering it?

badMovies,361xfx,jamiechristsuperstar,14,Fri May 15 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"I love stuff like this; ridiculously in-depth pieces. That said, man does this make me feel bad for Carvey, and do I wish the end of this tale was one of massive redemption."
badMovies,361xfx,mrwhalejr,16,Fri May 15 14:34:28 2015 UTC,"Too bad the author is so pointlessly caustic against Carvey - pretty hateful actually - it weakens or even negates some of the points he tries to make by forcing the reader to ask if there's some personal agenda here beyond critique.  For example, that bit about the women eating at a table? Reaching with such bizarre desperation."
badMovies,361xfx,thekeanu,9,Fri May 15 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm not disagreeing with the piece, it just feels a little mean.  Dana's brand of comedy hasn't evolved much, if at all, but I'm not one to fault him for it.  Comparing him to other contemporary SNL alum's isn't too fair either, especially when only comparing him to hyper-successful ones like Mike Myers.   From your writing, though, I would like to see you do a piece on relative successes/failures of contemporary SNL alumni (you could post it at /r/LiveFromNewYork).  I think you do an excellent job of finding important details and extracting interesting points from them, but maybe if it were a broader subject like that your writing voice would come across more clearly and less... well... mean.  That is odd how he doesn't talk about the movie, like, at all though.  Maybe that will change if/when he realizes the laughs he could get from self-deprication could possibly overcome his narcissism."

So, what's your point with this ""article,"" anyway?  To tear down one of the most talented comedians in recent history?  So what if he's doing corporate gigs with his family - he probably makes a good living doing that, and he gets to avoid typical Hollywood bullshit at the same time - I call that a win-win.  So he made a bad movie - so what?  What comedian doesn't have a few duds in their filmography?  It didn't ""kill"" his career any more than Love Guru or Cat in the Hat killed Myers's.  And if you're trying to be original by saying that Carvey has some deep-seated psychological issue that fuels his career as a comedian, I got news for you - that factoid is as old as dirt.  Every comedian out there comes from a place of darkness and pain.  Look no further than Richard Pryor.  Or Richard Jeni.  Or Richard Lewis.  Or Robin Williams.  Or Maria Bamford.  Hell, even Spalding Gray if you want to color outside the lines a little.  In summation, I have absolutely no idea why you wrote this ""piece"" or what the reader is supposed to get out of it."

As an Oaklander, this was especially weird. Lots of this (if not all) was filmed locally, but there are some strange choices they made for the production: in the opening sequence, Hammer first appears at an airport, and having flown in and out of Oakland International innumerable times over the last thirty years or so, I immediately recognized it as that one, both interior and exterior. The weird part, however, is that Hammer is then depicted crossing the Bay Bridge and entering Oakland, which would imply to anyone familiar with the region that Hammer landed at San Francisco International -- which is plausible I guess, depending on wherever he was coming from -- except OAK looks absolutely nothing like SFO. In general this struck me as a weird approach to having your hero make is return to his hometown -- why not just have him land in Oakland and leave it at that? No, better to complicate matters and imply that he landed at the airport where we aren't already filming.     Also, the exteriors for the big show in the ""film's"" ""climax"" were shot in Berkeley of all places, at the California Theater on Kitteridge Street, which is a movie theater in reality (I've been there a million times; I used to work a few blocks away, so I'd often go there when I got off work). Anyway, the California is pretty tiny -- even before it was carved up into a three-screen theater, it probably held maybe 500-600 people at most. The interiors we see in the movie here aren't very distinct, but you can see that it's a lot bigger than that. What strikes me as odd here is that they could've shot at one of Oakland's huge, beautiful theaters like the Paramount, but they opted to fake it by shooting outside the city (despite Hammer's persistently loyal-to-Oakland approach to his career back in the day).     Finally, just a fun little aside: during Hammer's heyday MTV did a piece on him where they traveled with him to the Oakland neighborhood where he grew up. A friend of mine, who had also grown up in Oakland, was watching this. They did an establishing shot of the apartment building where Hammer had lived, and my friend suddenly realized that he had once lived next door to a future M.C. Hammer, because there his house was, in that same shot of the apartment building. Crazy."

badMovies,33z0vq,Bayoublaster,5,Mon Apr 27 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"Probably, but I think that's fair; for a lot of the more famous films that they've spoofed (like Manos) the MST3K episode has so overshadowed and flavored the source film that you kind of can't expect the original work to be judged impartially anymore."

badMovies,33z0vq,candyman82,3,Mon Apr 27 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm part of a weekly riff that watches movies that make everything in the bottom 100 look brilliant, but they are so ""out there"" that the number of people who have seen them probably range in the hundreds.  MST3K did affect it as it made those movies more available to be seen.  Ed Wood movies were considered to be the worst of all time before MST3K, home video and the Internet made so many more horrible movies available to be seen.  It's understandable, though.  If no one knows about a movie, it's hard to get voted down."

He basically said Frank had to sit there and watch them all. He also said that what they selected were the movies you could actually ""make fun"" of and still have people be able to follow along. Some of the movies were so bad, they didn't even bother trying to base a show on them."
badMovies,33z0vq,numanoid,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:09:41 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  As Michael Weldon (The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film) wrote regarding Plan 9 From Outer Space: ""It's not actually the worst film ever made, but it's the most entertaining bad one you'll find.""  Most MST3K movies fall under that umbrella (though I'd argue against a few of them)."
badMovies,33z0vq,stinkermadness,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:44:09 2015 UTC,The proof is in the pudding. Almost all of the MST3K movies on the bottom 100 (with the exception of Manos) were not there until Netflix streamed the episode. Each MST3K movie in the bottom 100 was on Netflix at one point. Missing from the bottom 100 are the MST3K movies that were NOT on Netflix. Part of that is accessibility though I would think.

badMovies,33kdyw,WhereIsEmozilla,2,Thu Apr 23 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the experience was pretty indescribable, though it does play a little better on Hulu instead of a theater. What's interesting is that I watched it with someone who had never seen The Room, nor did they know anything about TW. They were enthralled by how absolutely horrible it was, much like I was when I saw The Room. The .gif I made was from the best part of the show, and it kinda captured my reaction. And since half the dialogue was so low/high you can barely make it out, I started exploring the set design and enjoyed how gonzo it was (eg the bikini clad character's TV is so hastily painted pink that the TV is ruined). I also love that, despite nearly everyone criticizing him, offering their two cents about the creative process and how to improve his craft, TW still doesn't seem to grasp how to make something good, or at least decent. Even his Room callbacks fail to capture the essence of why people like The Room. He still makes all the same mistakes with this show, and then some, because he doesn't have other people guiding him. TW is pure, unfiltered, crystal clear terrible, and this is perhaps an even purer example of that anti-genius in action. Does that make it watchable? Well, not really. But I had a good time watching it at home, if only to see an extension of what TW can and very much cannot do. I can't help but think of Unbreakable, and I wonder...if he's so very bad, is there some undiscovered talent who's his opposite?"

badMovies,33kdyw,Guy_FieriDust,5,Thu Apr 23 14:06:17 2015 UTC,This is what happens when a bad filmmaker pretends he was in on the joke the whole time. Wiseau is no Neil Breen or CTom.
badMovies,33kdyw,Thutman,3,Thu Apr 23 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"That .gif was really the best part of the show. Everything about it was terrible, but in a much worse kind of terrible then The Room. Like, it was really obvious that no effort whatsoever had been put into this production.   I wonder if that's because this was Tommy and Tommy alone. What if what made The Room so special was the input of people like Greg Sestero or Sandy Schklair."
badMovies,33kdyw,Shonuff8,2,Fri Apr 24 02:38:56 2015 UTC,"Rewatching The Room, now with the knowledge of the process that went into filming it, makes the actors performances much more interesting. Greg's performance now looks much more deliberately smug than inept, as it seems to appear more that he knew he was in a piece of shit film being directed by a madman, and could do nothing about it.  I think that deadpan smugness is what helps make it so ridiculous and funny."

badMovies,31wjgv,facade515,11,Wed Apr 8 18:39:01 2015 UTC,George Lucas' finest work
badMovies,31wjgv,burgersauce,2,Wed Apr 8 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"Seeing how it hasn't received the multiple revisions Star Wars has, Lucas must agree with you,"
badMovies,31wjgv,theflamingskull,8,Tue Apr 14 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"It's a bad one, but for my money the F4 and Captain America movies hastily slapped together to hold onto the rights are worse (I think both were made in the early 90s)."
badMovies,31wjgv,drchasedanger,9,Wed Apr 8 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Captain America was done by Albert Pyun, and is truly awful. The difference is that both of those movies were obscure and made on shoestring budgets, where this one had more money and promotional power behind it than God (George Lucas coming off of RotJ).   By the way, there is also a Nick Fury movie out there starring David Hasselhoff, which is reportedly almost as bad as the Corman F4 and the Pyun Captain America."
badMovies,31wjgv,drchasedanger,5,Thu Apr 9 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Captain America and F4 were just ashcan copies that barely saw the light of day and are somewhat difficult to actually find, as opposed to Howard the Duck which an unfortunate public went to see thinking Lucas could do no wrong. Boy, were they wrong.  I saw the Hasslehoff Nick Fury a while ago so I don't remember much, but at the time I actually enjoyed it because I always thought he'd make a great Fury (though it was mostly just hilarious). I also may have been intoxicated. But overall, it was pretty funny as opposed to F4/Captain America, which were just painful wastes of time."
badMovies,31wjgv,Schlock-or-Die,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:06:26 2015 UTC,The Captain America is very easy to find. I have it on Blu-Ray and only paid a few bucks for it. I see used copies for sale quite often actually. The F4 can be tough to track down though.

badMovies,31wjgv,ZombieHoratioAlger,3,Fri Apr 10 02:23:35 2015 UTC,This one had a full theatrical release; those two (while admittedly worse movies) were essentially ashcan copies they churned out to renew the copyrights.
badMovies,31wjgv,drchasedanger,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, that's why they're (luckily) really difficult to find. They weren't meant to see the light of day and it really shows. Howard the Duck is definitely the worst Marvel movie that you don't need to be a dedicated masochist to locate and watch. However, Ghost Rider 2, Elektra, and X3 aren't too far off from Howard.  Edit: Wolverine Origins is about that bad too, though it also did have a few sequences I didn't totally hate."
badMovies,31wjgv,GeorgeDouglasMcFly,5,Thu Apr 9 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"Man-Thing and Daredevil and X-Men: The Brett Ratner One are all way worse. This isn't a great movie, but it's not the destructive force that it's always been made out to be.  And now Howard is in the full Marvelverse, so let's make a new one happen. A film that sticks close to the source material would be brilliant."
badMovies,31wjgv,drchasedanger,3,Wed Apr 8 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I'll give you X-Men and Man-Thing, but ""angry Elektra cutting laundry to Evanescence in the rain"" scene aside, Daredevil was a bit more entertaining than Howard the Duck. The Elektra spin-off was way worse. There were hints of a better movie in Daredevil unfortunately bogged down by truly bad music and ham-fisted melodrama.   That said, I'm really fucking glad I'll be able to shove an entire season of good Daredevil into my eyes roughly 24 hours from now and forget that the movie ever happened."
badMovies,31wjgv,GeorgeDouglasMcFly,3,Thu Apr 9 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"I had forgotten about Elektra. What a waste of Stick. There are some good moments in that weird Daredevil cut--probably more than there are in Nicolas Cage's Ghost Rider--but the theatrical version is mostly inept. It probably would have been better if it had been stuffed with Coolio, and I don't say that about a lot of movies.  I'm ready for Netflix to get on with it. I need something great."
badMovies,31wjgv,drchasedanger,2,Thu Apr 9 03:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the theatrical cut was pretty bad, but the other cut is actually almost passable. Colin Farrell was actually a pretty good Bullseye, but he was dragged down by bad writing and directing choices. Kingpin also did a fairly decent job. Affleck wasn't terrible either, but it's not one of his better performances.  I have a lot of hopes riding on the Netflix show because I was disappointed by House of Cards, and if it's good it'll be a great sign for Iron Fist which is the one I'm personally most excited for since he's my favorite Marvel character next to Nightcrawler, Spider-Man, and Beta Ray Bill."

In five coordinated attacks, the perpetrators released sarin on several lines of the Tokyo subway, killing 12 people, severely injuring 50 and causing temporary vision problems for nearly 1,000 others. The attack was directed against trains passing through Kasumigaseki and NagatachÅ, home to the Japanese government. It is the most serious attack to occur in Japan since the end of World War II.

Also, there was a whole lot of money sunk into it, enough that it was a coffin nail for the independent iteration of TriStar. Financial failure, critically eviscerated, and a massive marketing fail: there are definitely reasons this can be considered a ""bad movie,"" but that's also not an absolute title.

Mark, on the other hand, the moral pivot around which The Room spins: Since Johnny and Lisa are such ridiculous one-dimensional caricatures, Mark is the only character who makes any actual decision between good & evil.

badMovies,2z0uns,worksafeaccountbiz,3,Sat Mar 14 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"During filming in 1977, Melanie Griffith was mauled by a lion and required plastic surgery. Griffith reportedly received fifty stitches to her face.  Cinematographer Jan de Bont was mauled and scalped by a lion on the set. de Bont required over 120 stitches to sew his scalp back from where a lion had bitten his head. After medical treatment, de Bont actually returned to the production to complete his D.O.P. duties.  During production, director/star Noel Marshall was attacked and severely injured by one of the lions in the film. He was hospitalized and it took him several years to completely recover from his injuries.  Assistant Director Doron Kauper was attacked and mauled by a lion during production filming of this picture. Kauper's throat was bitten open from whereupon the lion proceeded to bite his jaw and attempted to rip an ear off. Reportedly, this attack on Kauper almost cost him his life.  Tippi Hedren fractured a leg during production when an elephant bucked her off its back when she was riding on top. Moreover, also during production, Hedren was bitten on the back of her head by a lioness called Sheri. Hedren received thirty-eight stitches to the open wound. The incident can be seen in the finished picture. Hedren is hanging to the branch of a tree when thirty-four lions run across her. The thirty-fifth lion bites at her head. Hedren's screams and the blood seen are real. Hedren once said of being bitten by a lion: ""Let me tell you, it hurts when you're bitten by a lion. It's not only that you may have an open, gaping wound, plus shock, but the pressure of those enormous jaws is so strong that it hurts"".  John Marshall was bitten by a lion during production filming of this picture and required fifty-six stitches.  In September 1979, a bushfire threatened the ranch where this movie was filming. All the animals were evacuated to safety. Noel Marshall was clawed by a cheetah when protecting the wildlife during this fire.  In 1978, a flood from a dam break killed many lions in the film, washed away the set and destroyed nearly all of the movie, including ranch property, personal possessions, film sets, editing equipment, completed film footage and three key lions including Robbie, the movie's lion king. The picture was set back several years and the damaged done amounted to approximately US $4.5 million.   Jesus, at some point you just gotta throw in the towel and go home."

badMovies,2yz4w8,OhSanders,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's what I've got so far:  Here is an extended version of that scene. So it's at least 2 minutes.  After following the watermark and searching for his name on this turkish youtube-type site and watching a bunch of the videos, I determined that the specific watermark from your vid is from 2010 or 2009. Knowing that, and the fact that the clip has to be at least 2:00 long, helps narrow it down a little bit.   Also, the clip looks like it's from a movie set in the contemporary world, so that rules out all his swords and sorcery stuff, as well as anything where his hair is very dark. Him having lighter hair seems like the rarer clip.   I did not watch everything, but I took a sample of the first 30 pages. There are 98. I tried sorting by various metrics that it pretends to offer, but that would only yield 3 videos.   So if you are serious, check out every movie on that site with his name as a search term over 2 minutes that is from 2010 or 2009 or at least has that same watermark.   Good luck!  To aid you on your quest here is another rad video of him I found while looking for yours: http://alkislarlayasiyorum.com/icerik/38025/cuneyt-arkin-pelus-canavarlara-karsi  edit: although that's all assuming that it didn't get taken down off that site."

badMovies,2yomiv,facade515,8,Wed Mar 11 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"For me this movie excels in its pursuit of realism. For example, during scenes shot in Olympus where you can hear New York traffic engines and horns in the background.  And the continuity, such as when Hercules phones his little mate at the end and is suddenly voiced by the NY equivalent of James Earl Jones."
badMovies,2yomiv,JeffMcBiscuit,3,Wed Mar 11 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"If you can dig up the original version of the movie, that voice in the radio is the one they originally used to dub over ALL of Arnold's lines. When they went back years later to restore Arnold's audio, they found that he never recorded that bit. Thus, that voice that is clearly not Hercules is magically in the radio. https://youtu.be/CGBmPQy10r8"

badMovies,2ykctp,drchasedanger,2,Tue Mar 10 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought In Space was hilarious, but In The Hood was bad in the worst way (i.e. just plain boring). That said, none of them are worse than the reboot movie from last year, in which the Leprechaun was basically a half-goblin half-zombie gold eater with predator heat vision, but gold instead of red. They got Hornswaggle from WWE to play the Leprechaun and he was under so much make-up that it could've literally been anyone in there because he didn't say one word the whole movie.   Basically, before I rant for too long, never watch Leprechaun: Origins. It's just plain awful, and not in a fun way. Just straight up boring as hell. The best Leprechaun is 3, with the Were-Leprechaun."
badMovies,2ykctp,ElCrowing,2,Tue Mar 10 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"That's so disappointing to hear about Origins. I was hoping it would be hilariously awful, particularly because of Hornswaggle's involvement."
badMovies,2ykctp,drchasedanger,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. Hornswaggle made it sound like it would be on par with the better Leprechaun films, but he was buried under so much generic monster make-up that there is no way to tell it was him. Why cast someone like Hornswaggle if you're just gonna do this? Not only was he underwhelming but he didn't even show up until the movie was almost 2/3 of the way through. He almost looks like a shitty knock-off of the creatures in The Descent."
badMovies,2ykctp,drchasedanger,2,Tue Mar 10 22:26:42 2015 UTC,Duly noted! I think a Leprechaun marathon is in order. I'm not really sure whether to look forward to it or not though
badMovies,2ykctp,bankyandbrodie,2,Mon Mar 16 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"I did the same with a few different horror franchises over Spring Break last week. In pretty much every case (specifically Friday the 13th, Leprechaun, Hellraiser), there is a significant drop-off in quality by the 4th installment, because that's typically when the villain/monster(s) settle into a simple get resurrected->kill some more->rinse and repeat formula. The only exception I've found so far is the Elm Street franchise; in my opinion those movies stayed highly enjoyable despite increasing exponentially in ridiculousness from movie to movie up until the incredibly boring and way too serious reboot. In fact, not counting the remake, the second one is by far the worst.   Overall, the best horror franchises are the ones that don't forget to have fun. When they at least do that, even the really stupid later installments are still highly enjoyable despite being pretty bad in general (and honestly more comedy than horror).  May the luck of the Irish be with you on your quest. As long as you leave Origins out of it, it should be a fun time."

They loved the films but wanted to know what they were saying, as few in the ghettos understood English. And subtitles would be difficult to produce, and few could read anyway.

I am not upset that I helped fund it and other people will get to see it for free, but it just seems like an odd move for a studio.

It makes no sense, but perfectly emulates a nightmare: bizarre, stream of (un)consciousness horror scenes that go from location to location senselessly with lots of action in-between.

Tons of strange but very memorable scenes, like the ninja surgeon, exploding TV, and falling dummy. Need to rewatch this."

Cover the standard bad movies everyone covers, the Room and Troll 2 for example as they've been done to death, run a few scripted ideas and see what pops up in natural conversation then run with it. I prefer podcasts that don't get hung up on details that disrupt the flow of natural talk.  Originally my show was supposed to be about bad movies but it was obvious after the first one we didn't have the same passion as other people, so it was switched to cover lot more and conversation flowed better.

Plus there's something new and weird happening every few minutes, so it holds your attention. Plus Jim Varney is just electric.

Don't get me wrong the Razzies are a good thing for bad movies but rarely get it right. I wouldn't be surprised if 90% of the people that voted for Saving Xmas didn't even see it and just voted for it like they did on IMDB. Booooo. However it was worthy of the win (yes we saw it).
