OnceUponATime,3dtzw4,boundfortrees,18,Sun Jul 19 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"It's a cute series.  I liked the fact that it included a non-western fairy tail.  The plot stands on its own, though, so it's not necessary for watching OUAT."

OnceUponATime,3dtzw4,ProfUzo,10,Sun Jul 19 14:21:39 2015 UTC,I loved it. There is not alot of connections except Will Scarlet is from Storybrooke. But because they never gave him much of a story in OUAT it really doesn't matter much. But it is worth it to me.
OnceUponATime,3dtzw4,Royal_Robin,7,Sun Jul 19 16:21:38 2015 UTC,I thought it was good. The fact that it stands alone is a plus to me since it's self-contained and not mired in seasons of continuity.

They did bring Will Scarlet over into OUAT briefly, but the actor's role seems to have vanished the way of Red - by that I mean that actor got a role in a different series and so his OUAT role seems to have just kind of vaporized without explanation. In light of that, I don't think they'll bring over any more of the OUATIW canon to OUAT."

To be blunt, for me the girl playing Alice had no depth and made her feel like a disposable character to me. The Red Queen seems like a Saturday morning cartoon villian that can be defeated easily. The side characters are mediocre at best. There's nothing interesting enough to make me want to revisit the series. It lacks the charm, wit and mystery that OUAT is overflowing with."
OnceUponATime,3drwbi,MryddinWilt,6,Sat Jul 18 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"I have always wanted a season where we get flash-forwards instead of flash-backwards.  It doesn't need to have any time-travel gimmick; just something to show us the end results and then with the present day story, the mystery is how it all ends up that way.  I'm someone who doesn't even care about spoilers because the how and why is way more important to me than the what.  This would be a great way to do season 5.  The only other thing that would have been cool is if White Swan and Black Swan were in some kind of parallel presents that converge, but they've already set up enough to make that an impossibility."
OnceUponATime,3drwbi,josephdean21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:16 2015 UTC,The whole white/black swan concept reminds me a lot of swan lake. I'm wondering if they will pull a few ideas from that piece as well for this concept.
OnceUponATime,3drwbi,sageicedragonx,2,Sun Jul 19 17:01:25 2015 UTC,Or if the flash forwards are repercussions of what happens in the present

OnceUponATime,3drwbi,vocifery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:19 2015 UTC,I hadn't heard that do you remember where/when? A lot changes over the seasons. But they also said there were 'no new characters' in S5 but then said that they meant for the finale. They don't mind stretching the truth when needed to maintain the element of surprise. And context is everything with those guys.
OnceUponATime,3drwbi,StirOfGeckos,2,Sun Jul 19 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"When I saw the gray feathery costume (after having seen the black one) I thought back to when Jennifer Morrison said, a few years ago, that one of the inspirations for the Emma story was ""The Ugly Duckling,"" which made a lot of sense to me. So when I saw the pictures, I thought, ""there it is, there is the ugly duckling.""   Makes sense that they will cover the transformation instead of going directly to the black swan."

OnceUponATime,3dn3aw,DaywalkerGirl,6,Fri Jul 17 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"The way Jennifer talks about Emma being the Dark One is so exciting. I totally get where she, and Dark Emma, are coming from. She's always been a saviour, with everyone depending on her. She had to suppress her emotions, wants and needs to give everyone their happy ending. Now, being the Dark One, she doesn't need to do that any longer, and I can imagine her feeling more free and thus surrendering to the darkness. I can't wait for this to unravel, as although I am not this always-behind-the-villain kind of person, I am a big fan of Emma going dark, the person who is only filled with goodness, the product of true love and the Saviour of an entire population."
OnceUponATime,3dn3aw,vocifery,3,Fri Jul 17 20:06:26 2015 UTC,I came here to post this. :D I suspected this is what was happening and why they'd be in Camelot to see Merlin.

OnceUponATime,3dl0u3,sameyeam2,11,Fri Jul 17 03:54:31 2015 UTC,Didn't it though? He was reunited with Grace and they went off and presumably lived happily ever after. Unless there was more to his story (in terms of It being resolved) then I remember
OnceUponATime,3dl0u3,theverybest27,6,Fri Jul 17 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's pretty much it. His happy ending was getting his daughter back. Fin.  That makes me feel bad for Grace's Storybrooke parents, though...cursed with love for a child that they found out wasn't biologically theirs. Did they end up co-parenting with Jefferson or something? 'Cause otherwise that's really harsh. :( It makes me wonder who they were in FTL to get that sort of deal."
OnceUponATime,3dl0u3,freyalorelei,3,Fri Jul 17 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not an uncommon occurrence.   A secondary character's 'celeb status'/demand spikes due to a different project and their schedule fills up. Despite the fans wanting them to stay the show missed its window to lock them in.  it happens with bigger celebs too, like Jennifer Lawrence. When her star blew up all these roles that wanted her had to wedge themselves in between her multi-film commitments to Hunger Games and X-Men"

OnceUponATime,3di8m6,karmacorn,8,Thu Jul 16 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"A&E said that promo was just promotional not actual footage and that what we get on the show will be different. It's like the Captain Hook stuff was more like the traditional image (older, long hair, elaborate hat) until they cast O'Donoghue and firmed up the interpretation of the character. I am betting Emma and the transformation into Dark Swan is a slow build that will last most of 5A (if not the whole season). Even Rumple took a long time to get completely glittery and he took on the Dark One curse in the normal ""murder someone"" way. Emma did it to save people so it's gonna effect her differently."
OnceUponATime,3di8m6,MryddinWilt,5,Thu Jul 16 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"That the trailers are focusing on the season premier which is already shot and they are shooting episodes 2-4, somewhere in there.

OnceUponATime,3di8m6,josephdean21,2,Thu Jul 16 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"No glitter in Camelot. That's the confusing part. Camelot is part of the EF (we know because we met Lancelot there already) so she should be glittery. Unless she can control it, somehow."
OnceUponATime,3di8m6,josephdean21,3,Thu Jul 16 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Is Camelot actually in the Enchanted Forest?  Or is it ""EF-adjacent"" like Wonderland, Oz, Agrabah, Neverland, Arendelle, etc. are?  Even if not separated by a realm barrier, they could be far enough apart that the rules of magic can be different (since the EF's magic comes from the forest itself).  Kind of like how in season 2 we saw that there was some part of ""Fairy Tale Land"" that wasn't covered by Regina's curse, when we met Cora and Hook."
OnceUponATime,3di8m6,MryddinWilt,4,Thu Jul 16 15:55:36 2015 UTC,"It's possible - after all, Lancelot had left it by the time we met him, so it could be another realm entirely."
OnceUponATime,3di8m6,josephdean21,3,Thu Jul 16 16:06:18 2015 UTC,I think it's a separate realm from the EF. No reason to think it is in the Enchanted Forest. It's always talked about as being separate and in the Out of the Past comic book Jefferson visits with his hat.

Still, if Emma in these photos is supposed to be at the level we've seen in the promos, she should have some level of makeup to that effect.  Even the hair and outfit look more similar to the Heroes & Villains AU outfit; did they reuse the same gown?  Those promo videos may just exist to build hype, or maybe that's what we have to look forward to near the middle of the season, and at the start she's a bit more normal."

I know they haven't done Lilo and Stitch, but I think this is one of the themes of the show. It has come to mind several times while watching the show. Just because characters are gone from the screen doesn't mean they aren't remembered by everyone else. I think the best example of this is that you can still she the shadows of Graham around. From the shoelaces on Emma's wrist to the scars loosing him left on Emma's heart. The Echo's of peoples lives still have a place.   The other one I really like is this exchange between Regina and Gold:   Mr. Gold: Oh, let's not talk about intent. Intent is meaningless.  Regina: Intent is everything!   Their both right and their both wrong and it is so true. Intent is important but not all important, especially depending on outcome."

No, but I've always been this really sweet, innocent, smart, outsider type of girl (pretty much as basic YA as it gets), but then about five years ago I started changing a lot with not being able to control my mood at all. In periods I would be aggressive or violent and then again other periods I would be extremely depressed. I had so much amazing stuff going on in my life, but often I couldn't appreciate it at all. My family and I did everything to get me help, but because I hadn't tried to kill myself or hurt anyone else physically I was sent to the hell of waiting lists. Then everything just went worse and worse, I couldn't see anything for what it was and just wanted to die. At a psychiatric emergency room they had evaluated, that I suffered from depressive single episode (roughly translated, meaning just ""basic depression""). My doctor therefore gave me some anti-depressants, to help me. What he didn't know, and what I wasn't sure of yet, was that I was (and am) bipolar with tendencies to psychosis and the drugs and mistreatment and myself drove my into a psychosis, which is the worst thing I have experienced in my life. When I finally got through it I was happy until I started realizing how much I had fucked up, like really, really badly and how much I had hurt the people who I loved. I began having serious panic attacks and I couldn't stand being alone in quiet, leaving me to have the television going almost always. This was when a good friend of mine suggested that I watched Once. And man, bless her heart for that! I found such amazing, indescribable solace in this show and these characters. I esspecially loved Snow and Charming, because my boyfriend had stood by my side through the last 5 years of ups and downs, always loving me, and their struggles reminded me of us. That's why I also loved it (sort of) when Snow had Regina kill Cora and wouldn't get out of bed. I was myself in bed feeling sorry for myself over how bad a person, I though I was, but that whole storyline of Snow getting back on the horse really helped me do the same. Sorry, this was super long and emotional, but yeah. I guess Once really opened my eyes to the fact taht I wasn't the only person in the world who had made mistakes and been through shit, and that I wasn't the only one who needed to believe in magic, hope, redemption and love as the most powerful thing of all :)"

OnceUponATime,3dcz9f,sinkwater,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:45:04 2015 UTC,They also had new footage while Stars Wars just had some behind the scenes stuff and that concert. New footage is always going to top. plus superheroes are super hot right now.
OnceUponATime,3dcz9f,loki1887,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it's mostly because the new Star Wars actually looks pretty good - not to mention they only had some behind the scenes footage.

OnceUponATime,3d21lq,oogieboogie1996,10,Sun Jul 12 22:01:52 2015 UTC,I like this idea a lot better than the idea that Merida is the daughter of Robin Hood and Zelena.  This would be way more interesting.
OnceUponATime,3d21lq,SpinsterTerritory,3,Mon Jul 13 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Anything but her being the daughter of Zelena, that would be a terrible change for the Merida's character"
OnceUponATime,3d21lq,mirandaran,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"My only issue with this theory is that Merida is an adult in the show, which means a massive time jump would have to happen."
OnceUponATime,3d21lq,glitterwrists,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean. Time jump how? Between the age of OUAT Merida and Brave's Merida? Is that what you mean? Because I hate to break it to you, but this show plays fast and loose with that type of thing all the time.  Disney's Snow White is supposed to be 14. And Ginnifer Goodwin, while a beautiful woman, is unable to pass for 14. Ariel is supposed to be 16, as is Aurora, as per their Disney movies. Their OUAT counterpart actresses are women who are clearly older than that.   Are you taking about Merida possibly being from the past, ie, possibly Runple's mom or the seer Runple got his powers from? If so, OUAT does flashbacks all the time.   But I think you did not read the thread and think that we think Merida will be the offspring of Robin Hood and Zelena. That's not what I wrote. I wrote that that I didn't like that idea. And it's one that has since been debunked by Eddy and Adam."

OnceUponATime,3d21lq,glitterwrists,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so.  The Seer was very young when we first saw her, still just a kid, really.  And by that point she already had the creepy eyeball hands.  Merida is an adult and seems perfectly normal."
OnceUponATime,3d21lq,Malarkay79,3,Mon Jul 13 06:24:00 2015 UTC,Thank the Lord that she's not Rumple's mom. Maybe the whole Rumple's mom thing was a rouse to cast Merida. I lack a theory for now but I wonder how she'll be intertwined with Camelot

OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,lol_catd,11,Sun Jul 12 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you just described everyone on that show. Sometimes it gets so cringe-worthy, but dammit if I don't keep coming back for more."
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,Wickk,5,Sun Jul 12 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, my goto example has becomes Snows explanation of what they did to Maleficent. Like she for real used like 10 lines of dialogue just describing the meaning of horrible before actually saying what they did"
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,bluerang1,18,Sun Jul 12 15:18:56 2015 UTC,No cleavage so not really evil?
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,Kevinteractivo,6,Sat Jul 11 20:54:08 2015 UTC,I'm dying to know why she's in a magic prison.
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,crackinthewall,3,Sun Jul 12 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"Or why she seems to be in FTL? Is this past FTL or will we meet Mulan, etc. again? I hope we do!"
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,darkdude103,5,Sun Jul 12 11:55:33 2015 UTC,She looks hot
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,DwendilSurespear,6,Sat Jul 11 19:42:39 2015 UTC,What's with the glitter she' supposed to by the dark one not the sparkly one
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,Domyfranky,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:15:45 2015 UTC,Getting tips from Twilight xD
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,zhbrui,8,Sun Jul 12 15:22:05 2015 UTC,creeepy! this is awesome!
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,TDIfan241,4,Sat Jul 11 18:52:00 2015 UTC,Is this the first time we have actually watched a heart turn to dust? Usually the camera cuts away/is blocked so that we don't see the exact moment at which the heart turns to dust...
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,owarwolf,3,Sun Jul 12 16:23:59 2015 UTC,Reminds me of a deleted scene from season 1 where we were supossed to first meet Rumple.
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,musthavebeenbunnies,2,Sun Jul 12 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of hate that instead of making her more similar to Rumple's EF Dark One look, she's a ""pretty"" version with gentle frosting of white glitter. Seems less inspired than the designs I'm used to seeing on this show."
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,prettylilhanna,2,Sun Jul 12 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"Guys, A and E (if I'm not mistaken) said this is mostly just a promo look and JMo says Dark Swan has a FULL closet (hopefully with some evil cleavage baring duds). So yeah, let's wait for more!"
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,Tangled349,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:32:00 2015 UTC,I wonder how Evil Emma will differ from Evil Queen
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,TerraRyan11,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:32:28 2015 UTC,I love this new look! It seems like they are playing off of Emma evoking both the dark and light sides of herself. She totally killed that man but at the same time seems to take little pleasure in the act itself like she is in some haze.
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,Mathavian,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:56:37 2015 UTC,im sorry she looks absolutely retarded
OnceUponATime,3cxqh6,rchoichoi,-4,Mon Jul 13 06:47:41 2015 UTC,"Dark, evil, and then dumb. Must be an ""evil"" member of the Charming family!  She does realize that she could have used that heart to get out, right?"
