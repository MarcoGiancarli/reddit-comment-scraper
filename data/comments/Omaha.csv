There was a big project to improve efficiency and reduce turn around time... We almost doubled our productivity.  They fired 75% of the department (including most of us involved in the project) and brought in temp employees to fill the gaps.  I'm good friends with two people who work at PayPal.  One is in IT, but the other has progressed up the ladder of the phone teams pretty quickly.  They moved him out to Arizona about a year ago.  Long story short, I'd say PayPal, but I'm not exactly an unbiased source."

Omaha,3e03ep,tomcatgunner1,4,Mon Jul 20 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"I was in your shoes once, and took the job with PayPal for over a year.  Entry level doing email support.  I cannot emphasize enough that PayPal's ""super relaxed"" atmosphere is all smoke and mirrors.  Once you're really integrated into the production floor, it is just as rigid and corporate as anyone else.    Every move you make is monitored (both physically and computer actions), time is tracked down to the minute, the layers of bureaucracy are tremendous, the petty office politics are real, and there are performance quotas attached to everything.  It could not be more corporate.  They put a ""hip tech company""  coat of paint on themselves and market it quite well around town, but it is so far detached from reality.  You are also correct about PayPal's HR department.  They are trigger happy and will fire anyone for anything at the drop of a hat.  I saw good people brutally fired for trivial reasons because they were not well liked.  I saw an incompetent jerk make a mistake that cost the company $20,000 and had it covered up because he was well connected.  I can't speak to Mutual, but I get really burned to see the lie that PayPal is this super hip trendy employer."

I will say that outside of CS employees doing entry-level support, PayPal is EXCEEDINGLY reticent to fire people. If you can move up the chain at all, it is a good company to work for.  If you never most past an entry-level CS job and you have a poor relationship with your direct supervisor, I can see how that would be bad. But it does not in anyway reflect the overall culture of a company with 35,000 employees."

She made more than her supervisor because of seniority, because of this, he falsified her eval saying she cannot complete the job requirements.  She got canned shortly after, and was devastated.  Granted, coming new you won't likely face this but it does show the power that the hiearchy carries a bigger hammer than those that have been there longer."

Six months later, almost to the minute, after his rehire freeze period expired, he literally begged for his job back. He took a demotion to get it. It wasn't because the company was horrible. The work was horrible.  I know a guy who did something more like SMB-facing IT support. He tolerated the job, but he was always looking for a better one. He found one and never looked back.  I haven't heard any similar horror stories from Mutual, although I don't know any of their phone people."

Omaha,3e03ep,sheps138,0,Tue Jul 21 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"I think that may be the difference. Temps are treated differently, and have weird rules about getting hired on thanks to contractual obligation between the agencies."

When the show was over we sat by our car in the chairs we couldn't take in and listened to music and chilled. When the traffic died down we left and hit McD's.  The bands were great!

I don't have the dimensions on me so I can't get you exact, unfortunately. All our games have plenty of space to walk around and emergency exits that are always accessible, so if you or a friend is uneasy about being 'locked in a small, cramped space' you can rest easy.

I don't have a particularly high view of the program.  At the time I went through it, the major I was in was still very underdeveloped.  So I felt like they sold me a house, only to move in and find it half-finished.  I remember vividly having no instructor for the first four weeks of an essential required course, only to have the eventual professor come in with no teaching plan, no experience teaching in the U.S., and then failing about 90% of the class in a most excruciating and unfair manner.  And then I remember trying to describe this problem to the scholarship committee and getting a profoundly tone deaf response.  It's a good program for some, they have great resources, and treat their recipients well.  But all that apparatus is moot if they're supporting crappy programs in the university itself.  I would really research the program you want to enroll in to make sure they have strength in your major."
Omaha,3dur0n,MemoryAccessRegister,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"I received it with a 33 ACT and a 4.0 GPA. At that time, they also required 3 letters of recommendation, a resume filled with outside activities, and a fairly rigorous interview process. I will caution you that the program went downhill once Mike McGinnis left, IMHO. While the reasons behind him leaving so suddenly aren't fully known, he had a lot of passion for the program and organized a lot of good events for the Scott Scholars. After he left, the quantity and quality of events we had went down significantly. They keep trying to say it's a development program (in addition to the money) and it's really not."

I've found that when it comes to fire pits, it mostly boils down to if your neighbors like you or not. If your fire isn't within 20 or so feet of a building, and you have a working hose nearby (or something that could cover the pit), you're usually alright. FYI - fire barrels and above ground pits will break down and even collapse if you burn a lot and often.  Dig a big hole in the yard, surround it with 2-3' of pretty rocks/concrete/cinder blocks/whatever and you should be good to go."

Omaha,3djzc2,AlexFromOmaha,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"The actual maximums do include jail time, and I've seen them used. Like most victimless crimes, though, there's a lot of prosecutorial discretion involved.  Paying the reinstatement fee is not necessarily the last step to license restoration. That's case-by-case (well, not really case-by-case, but ""traffic ticket"" isn't enough to answer the question) and should be explicit in paperwork you got from the state.  If your license was valid at the time of the ticket, you plead not guilty regardless of anything else said except ""we're dropping the driving on a suspended license charge"". That's why there's arraignment. After the arraignment (or during, if the prosecutor makes himself available), tell him what happened and he'll tell you what your next steps are. He'll probably clear it up for the cost of the speeding ticket, or a dollar plus court costs if he really doesn't want to deal with you. Prosecutors tend to be assholes. They spend their whole day dealing with asshole criminals and other asshole lawyers. Don't let that dissuade you. If you can't talk to him, you're going to end up paying a lawyer to help clear it up.  If your license was not valid at the time of the ticket, the prosecutor will say right at the start if he wants to pursue jail time or not as part of your sentence. If he's suggesting jail time, most judges are just going to run on the assumption you want to plead not guilty and start asking if you'll hire your own lawyer or are poor enough to get a public defender.  If you lost your paperwork, you can check here. I honestly don't know how accurate that particular system is. Nebraska's governmental websites are a patchwork of incoherent systems put together by the lowest bidder, and some of them reflect that."

It will be difficult to find a job just doing HTML/CSS or Python.  There are some, but they will be harder to find, and pay a lot less.  If Java, you'll want to look at Spring MVC and probably hibernate.  .NET you'll want to look at MVC and Entity Framework.  With either you'll also want some experience with a database, MySQL and MSSQL are the most accessible.  A Javascript framework like JQuery is also something people are looking for experience with.  Unfortunately, unlike 15-20 years ago, it is a lot harder to get yourself a job with just personal experience.  Then, everything was so new and everyone wanted a web site you could break in rather easily.  'Real' developers were working on other systems and couldn't be bothered with this web stuff.  Hiring a kid who could make some pretty pages out there was the way to go.  Now, most of the application development has shifted to web development.  It can be tough area to break into now days without formal education, again, you'll be really limited in your options, and the larger companies in town won't look at you, and most of the recruiters won't either.  There's an accelerated .NET training program down in KC run by Centriq that I've heard very good things about.  It can give you the skills most employers are looking for and help you get your foot in the door and help you land an entry level position.  It's an investment in time and money, but programming jobs are lucrative and plentiful right now.  65K is pretty much the bottom of the range for a .NET or Java developer in my experience.  Someone with 5+ years experience at a larger company can pretty easily command 90+ if they are good.  Honestly, the best way to guarantee a good job is to get a CSCI degree.  UNO and Creighton both have outstanding programs.  Huge investments, but we need more developers today, and I don't see that changing soon.  More people are going to school to get Degrees in things like English and history than computer science."
Omaha,3dhmfj,CoopNine,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:24 2015 UTC,Grails is a good starting point.  No extraneous configuration and can whip up an MVC app in no time.  Works great as a RESTful provider too with an Angular front end.
Omaha,3dhmfj,SoulTrack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:04:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. I've definitely been considering starting to learn more Javascript and C++ whenever I feel satisfied with python (was planning on starting Django sometime soon). I haven't really considered Java or .Net though.   I considered going back to school for a computer science degree. I have my bachelors in biological sciences and not a day goes by where I don't wish I would have just went with CS; I was naive and thought it was going to end up being IT and I hated fixing other peoples computers since I was a kid. Now I do nothing but wish. However, I really am hoping I can avoid going back to school; I am debt free and would like to keep it that way if possible. I realize that this will be harder (to get companies to even consider me) but I feel like it's possible."

Omaha,3dhmfj,sumeetjain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"C++ doesn't really have an impact on web development.  Java and C# (.NET) are what most applications are using.  I don't want to seem like I'm putting down any other language and they are at times the best choice for a particular application, but enterprise applications are generally going to be either Java or .NET.  Good news is though, syntactically the two are very similar.  C# was a response to Java, which shares a lot with C++.    Also, concepts and architecture are as important as language.  Understanding the patterns which are used in web development, such as MVC, is paramount to being a good developer.  I'm of the mind that understanding patterns and when and why to use them is something you should start learning before you really get into a language.  If you don't you spend a lot of time having to re-learn how to do things properly, or looking at how things are presented and not understanding why when you may see a faster way to the finish line.  If I could recommend two books to someone wanting to really learn how to be a good developer it would be Design Patterns by the 'Gang of Four' and Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java.  Both really approach why you're doing things in what to a novice may seem excessive or unnecessarily complex.  Additionally there's pluralsight.com  It requires a subscription, but it really is an amazing resource with tons of courses that are relevant.  (Excellent series on design patterns too)  Well worth the subscription in my opinion.    Finally if getting a degree isn't something you want to do, it still might not be a bad idea to take some courses at UNO or Creighton.  You can establish some relationships with the instructors who have ties to the business world.  I owe my career to one particular CSCI instructor who helped me get my foot in the door.  There are also user groups where you can meet other developers.  Like any career networking is important."

I used to see Teresa... Campbell... I think... I suck at remembering names, but she was PHENOMENAL, but then she left to take another position that didn't involve seeing patients, and I guess I'm trying to find that perfect mix again of understanding, application, but just enough snark and sarcasm that made me feel very comfortable that we were people and not just a technician working on a broken machine.

Omaha,3dc2vu,IsntThatSpecia1,18,Wed Jul 15 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Short answer: no, not really.  Long Answer: I don't like to defend Cox, as I'm not a fan. So I guess you can take that into consideration with this answer.  Cox is one of the last cable companies in the country to make this switch. Most of the ""small towns"" around Omaha went through this months if not years ago. ""Analog"" channels aren't really a thing that exists anymore. When Cox receives the channels, they get them in a digital format. They are then paying for a system to convert them to analog. Then they have to send the same channel out twice: once for analog viewers and again for digital viewers. This means they have fewer communications channels to send awesome things like faster internet or higher-definition channels, or any other technologies that come along.   If you use an antenna, this happened like 10 years ago. ""Cable Cutters"" actually had this happen to them BEFORE Cox did it by a decade. Cox knew it was going to be difficult, so they actually waited about as long as possible. But, like most American white girls, they just can't even anymore.  While it may not be your favorite that it costs a few dollars more a month, you do get all-digital channels that look way better and actually fit your screen, you get the on-screen guide, and they even threw in some of the higher-up channels plus the music stations that you weren't getting previously.   Again, I'm not a Cox fan. I don't use their TV service myself. But in the long run this is actually a good move for them and for their customers. People just want to bitch about everything."
Omaha,3dc2vu,HuskerLax18,3,Wed Jul 15 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"I know a few people who cancelled their cable service, but are still getting free cable. Requiring boxes will eliminate this problem as well."
Omaha,3dc2vu,newchong,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well put. Not Cox's fault for making the switch, but their fault for coddling customers who didn't want to make the digital switch."

Omaha,3dc2vu,TLGJames,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:39:26 2015 UTC,this right here. They aren't really screwing everyone so much (see above post) but they are neglecting to mention they are also encrypting everything. Thank god for Cable Cards!

I'm honestly surprised this didn't happen a few years ago. I'm not a fan of cable; I cut the cord years ago, but this doesn't seem like an annual-rate-hike kind of screwing.   Honestly, I'm not here to defend cox, but I really can't imagine getting upset about this."

Omaha,3dc2vu,MildlyOffensiveAR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:42 2015 UTC,You might not necessarily need a box . you're just getting the local channels which are the same as over the air.  Cox may still provide those for free. A lot of people dont realize this works even without cable

Omaha,3d7all,wildjokers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"The city doesn't perform legal surveys. You will have to hire a third party for that.   I'm not aware of a requirement to produce a legal survey for a fence permit. Legal surveys are recommended to protect yourself from potential legal action by an adjoining neighbor if the fence inadvertently encroaches on their property.  Any reputable fence contractor should be able to help you out and answer your questions. In terms of surveys, most will probably have a firm they work with, and offer a legal survey as an added service, but you're free to use a surveyor of your choice."
Omaha,3d7all,ShellAnswerMan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:39:54 2015 UTC,"Your fence company can handle the permits, and maybe even the site survey, at least I think S&W did when they did my fence in the spring."
Omaha,3d7all,SomeFakeInternetName,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:17:11 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they are marked already, do you see any wood sticking out of the ground in any of the corners of your property?  If not then you can have a survey done by a 3rd party.  It's not required that you have it done to get the permit, but it's a good idea so that you know where you can put the fence to be on the up and up.    Fences can legally be built on the properly line, but have to be entirely on your side of the line to be legal and the drawing must reflect that to pass the permit process.  If you build the fence over the line anyone that has an issue with it has 7 years to dispute it, but after 7 years it becomes the new legal property line.  This includes anyone from the city or your neighbors.    The permit requirements will be a simple drawing of approximately where the fence would be, rough measurements are good and the drawing doesn't have to be to scale.  A good way to do it would be to print your lot off from the DC Assessor site and simply hand draw the fence in there with measurements.  It doesn't have to be a fancy or professional drawing by any means.    Source:  I built my own fence.  I opted for the survey, the wood stakes give you a great place to tie off a straight line to build the fence.  Make sure to tie from the inside of the stakes not the center of it to ensure you stay on your side."
Omaha,3d7all,pheaton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"Already mentioned, but I'll +1 - get a survey done by a company in the area. Don't be surprised if it's a little more costly than you expect. Everyone is always a little sticker-shocked until they realize that you're not just paying for a couple of corners being set - you're paying for the Surveyor and their expertise, their time, equipment, and most importantly? They are liable if they bone something. If they blow a corner and you build your fence in the neighbors yard? They're on the hook.  Better safe than sorry."

Omaha,3d3tzs,NoOneLikesNebraskans,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:17 2015 UTC,Check out Dragons Lair in the 156th and Q plaza. I see they have a table set up in the back and I've seen people playing on it a couple times too. They should have set events if you talk to the person working.
Omaha,3d3tzs,Cobra7fac,2,Mon Jul 13 21:58:52 2015 UTC,4+ is a gaming club with a private storefront. We don't advertise and New members are by word of mouth.  Mostly we do tabletop games but there is a D&D group. Some of us are doing Pathfinder ACG.  Let me know if you are interested.
Omaha,3d3tzs,22cthulu,2,Tue Jul 14 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"There are a few Pathfinder Societies in town, if you go to their official site you'll find a few group. The only problem is that most only meet once or twice a month.   The Dragons Lair off 90th and Blondo has a Werewolf d20 modern game every other Saturday evening.   Best way to find a group is to head over to the game stores and place a looking for group advert on their post boards."

Any lawyer want to explain the legalities of an EMT letting a guy go down river instead of to the hospital immediately after CPR was performed?  I would think that perimortem status would serve as a good reason to ignore the pt's wishes and take him to the ED."
Omaha,3d0w2o,riverfan,2,Sun Jul 12 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"EMTs didn't do CPR. Another group was tubing down the river, saw the guy stuck in branches, and there were three people in that group with medical training, so they hopped out and pulled the guy onto the ground, where they did the heimlich first, and then he started coughing. He was blue in the face tho, and genuinely not going to make it. The group the guy was with were sooooo drunk. They didn't want to stop, so they took the guy on a tube and floated him down the river. EMTs did stop the group, and talked to the drunk guy, but legally, if he's responsive and walking, they can't force him to go. That's my understanding, anyway."

Omaha,3coi6l,dazyabbey,10,Thu Jul 9 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"Article:   SARPY COUNTY, Neb. (WOWT 6 News) - The Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office told WOWT 6 News Wednesday that a Fourth of July Fireworks complaint turned into a brutal beating early Sunday morning. Chief Deputy Greg London said three adults and one juvenile were arrested after they beat up two men who asked them to stop lighting fireworks at 1:50 a.m. One of the victims is in critical condition and undergoing reconstructive face surgery at CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center.  Chief Deputy London said around 1:50 a.m. Mark Paulsen and Logan Skow walked to a neighbor’s home near 156th and Giles Road to ask them to stop lighting fireworks. London said after Paulsen and Skow asked them to stop, the other men refused.  The Sheriff’s Office said the men lighting the fireworks jumped Paulsen and Skow when they began to call 911. Skow told WOWT 6 News the beating went on for about 10 minutes. Skow said he hit grass, but Paulsen hit concrete and was knocked unconscious. Suspects  Branden Short, his brother Andrew Short, and Nathan Christensen were arrested after running away from the scene. A juvenile involved in the fight was also arrested. WOWT 6 News is not naming the juvenile.  All three men, and the one juvenile are charged with 1st degree Class 3 Felony Assault for beating Mark Paulsen. He is in critical condition at the hospital, with bleeding on the brain. Wednesday afternoon he underwent reconstructive face surgery.  Paulsen’s family said he is at risk of going blind and may lose feeling in his face. He will be in the hospital for at least the next week. The recovery time at home may take months.  The three men and one juvenile are also all charged with 1st degree misdemeanor assault, for beating Skow. Skow’s inuries were not as serious. He was released from the hospital.  Deputy Chief London said the fight was large. He said when Sheriff’s Deputies arrived on scene there were about 10 people outside. He said Paulsen and Skow were found on the ground in the middle of the street.  All four suspects posted bond at 10% of $25,000 ($2,500) and were released from the Sarpy County Jail.  WOWT 6 News went to the Short’s house for comment, but the suspects declined to comment.  The victims set up a GoFundMe page to help with medical costs: gofundme.com/markpaulsen."

Omaha,3ck0aa,JTempl,4,Wed Jul 8 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't a way to help people. This is a way to deny benefits.   It's already pretty easy to get denied them in this state, because we are an at will employment state. Unless you are clearly laid off, you probably won't receive unemployment.  Plus, the system is incredibly underfunded as it is, and does not have the resources to allocate services as needed. Making another requirement like this would create longer wait times and more bureaucracy.   As an example of how underfunded it is, look at this website:  https://uibenefits.nwd.ne.gov/BPSWeb/bpsLeftMenu.do?handleId=1021_HLP   If you use the drop down menu and select ""Technical Questions"" you can find some great answers to these questions:  1 Which browsers meet security requirements?  2 How can I get the most recent version of the America Online browser?  3 Why do the graphics look so small (or large) in my browser?  4 How can I get the most recent version of Microsoft Internet Explorer?  5 Can I make the text on your pages bigger?  6 What's the difference between Netscape Navigator and Netscape Communicator?

Omaha,3ck0aa,cheddar_daddy,7,Fri Jul 10 20:38:08 2015 UTC,"I personally like this idea as well. Sometimes people are hard on luck and genuinely need government unemployment benefits but that doesn't mean they should be comfortable enough to stop looking for work. Nebraska boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country and while not all of our jobs available are pretty, they are out there.   I just hope Ricketts doesn't plan on using this as a way to get rid of benefits to those who are legitimately looking for work."
Omaha,3ck0aa,NebraskaMerican,7,Wed Jul 8 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I definitely don't trust him based on his limited track record thus far. However, this seems to be a good idea going in the right direction."
Omaha,3ck0aa,FyreWulff,3,Wed Jul 8 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"This really doesn't change much.   In Nebraska, you can only get food stamps and assistance if you have a job. ""Looking for a job"" does not count. The amount of time you can not have a job is extremely short, and basically the only way to get assistance permanently and not work as an adult is to be disabled, which is a whole other ball of wax (doctors involved, etc) I assume this is just more money for Workforce Development, which people can already use. If you're on unemployment (that you paid into to use, by the way), you know you have a limited time and can use that time to look for a job in your own way.   Either this is just basically a feelgood announcement and red meat for his base that has no actual effect (because the programs are already there, just smaller) or it's going to waste people's time (they're using a recruiter or doing well applying to their own jobs, but now you have to waste your time with the government program simultaneously, basically adding a pointless middleman to your job search.)"
Omaha,3ck0aa,Teanut,3,Wed Jul 8 21:23:38 2015 UTC,"It's adding a middle man. I read something about ""one to one training on how to use the electronic resume feature"" on NE Works, among other means of ""assistance.""  It's just going to hassle some people out of filing for unemployment that are perfectly capable of finding a job on something that isn't NE Works."
Omaha,3ck0aa,SabrinaFaire,3,Thu Jul 9 00:23:53 2015 UTC,"Right. When I was unemployed the problem wasn't that I didn't know how to use the electronic resume feature or that I needed to take yet another career interest inventory. Yeah we have low unemployment, doesn't mean those are good jobs."
Omaha,3ck0aa,FyreWulff,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'd rather they spend money to open more NE Works (Which I just found out is the new name of WD) locations than waste people's time with middlemen. There used to be an office right on 24th & O-ish, now it's way out on 60th street. North O's is at least on a major street (Ames), the South O one is out in the ass end of an industrial park. Terrible location for both South O and West O residents to get to. Annoying when government offices seem to keep getting built farther and farther from regular bus lines, and requiring busses to get to in the first place."

I knew a guy in high-school I later read about had a drunken fight with his girlfriend, took their infant son and drove away in a rain storm with his son on his lap.  He crashed, his son died, last I heard he was in prison with his life a complete mess.  Was a nice guy in school, funny and laid back.  I've also known people that seem a little off, but you never know if they are just are dicks or are criminal sociopaths.  I'd be curios to see what the relationship was with the victim, what he was trying to do and why."

Omaha,3ch34l,serious_wat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"This probably isn't possible. Even if you bought an unlock code from someone on eBay or similar, Verizon probably wouldn't accept the phone onto their network. Check out my reply below to /u/sirpotsalot_iii for more information."

Omaha,3ch34l,serious_wat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:25:23 2015 UTC,"The relevant law would be the legal principle of ""pay for shit you buy"". The number one reason they wouldn't unlock it is if the contract associated with it hasn't been paid in full. The reason you can get a $600 phone for next to nothing up front is because its cost is built into the monthly service bill. If you walk away from that early, Sprint isn't getting paid for a significant chunk of the value of the phone."
Omaha,3ch34l,CoopNine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:00:39 2015 UTC,Is it under contract?  I am going to Europe in a month and I just contacted Sprint chat and they literally unlocked my S4 this morning in a few seconds. No questions asked. If it's under contract most likely they won't do it since the phone isn't totally paid.
Omaha,3ch34l,serious_wat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"The reason they will say no is if the person who gave the phone still owes on the phone and are in a contract. Even if you get it unlocked sprint will blacklist the ESN and the phone will stop working on verizon,  it basically gets reported as stolen.    Your best bet would be to have the person who gave her the phone try to get sprint to unlock it, assuming they are in good standing with sprint."
Omaha,3ch34l,CoopNine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:28:58 2015 UTC,"Even if the phone is fully paid off through the contract, i.e. not ""stolen"", Verizon probably won't accept it anyway. Traditionally, they only accept phones onto their network that have serial numbers which are whitelisted. Meaning, you have to get a phone that came through a Verizon store or Verizon-approved retailer. I've heard they're slowly considering moving towards open-season bring-your-own-device, but I don't think it's quite there yet."
Omaha,3ch34l,sirpotsalot_iii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"With LTE devices you should be able to just drop in an existing (activated) SIM, and it will work.  I've not tried with an iPhone, but this is working with Nexus 6 phones.  I purchased directly from Moto at release and just put my SIM from my previous phone with no issues.  The Nexus 5 didn't work this way, but it also had a more limited radio."

Nite Owl across the street makes a mean burger, regularly shows cult movies, and even has FRIED OREOS. That's probably one of my favorite go to joints. Mula has Taco Tuesday's, where their tacos are $2 each. Archetype coffee is delicious. Caffeine Dreams is a bit more of a stroll but usually has a crowd about your age. Midtown Cinema is walking distance and has $5 movies on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Crescent Moon is also a short stroll and is pretty tasty - I love their wings and Gauc On The Moon burger. It's too bad you're all underage, because Sullivan's down the street does karaoke on Thursday and my room mates and I intend to go regularly. Say hello sometime!"

This is for your safety, and for the safety of the animals. I really enjoyed my training, and most importantly, I felt very well-prepared once I started ""flying solo"".  Volunteer orientation is done only twice a year, in January and September. Here's the link to learn more about the program, and to fill out an application.  We have a really excellent animal shelter serving our area. It's not  perfect, but the staff and volunteers do a really good job of handling an incredible volume and variety of animals, and of rehabbing and finding good homes for them wherever possible. I think you'll really enjoy learning more about them.  PM me if you have any more questions. I work in adoptions and dog walking, if you're interested in those specific areas."

If it's a Honda/Acura, I hear nothing but great things about ""Exclusive Honda & Acura Repair"" on Leavenworth, although I haven't used them personally. If it's a European car, I've had good luck with Cordel Foreign Motors. They're one of the few shops I trust with servicing my classic Mercedes, but they also service new cars too. While their shop isn't super fancy, Joel and Egon are friendly, extremely knowledgeable about European cars, and try to keep costs reasonable.  For anything else I'd recommend Charlie Graham. Again, not a super fancy shop but very friendly, knowledgeable and fair."

Omaha,3c1msp,wikster2014,4,Fri Jul 3 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"Here are some things I like to do:   Tube down the Elkhorn.  You can go with an outfitter like Uncle Scott's or Tubing & Adventures.  You can also do it yourself. Cabela's is currently selling River Run tubes for $15, and you can get life jackets (you need them, its a law and its heavily enforced) at Walmart for $6.  Other than that you need a short paddle and a cooler tube ( I bought both on Amazon).  You can get in at a public access site near Valley on Bennington Road and tube down to another site on Maple at 204th. It takes about 3 hours.  You can have alcohol on the River, you just can't open it until you get into the River (no glass).  Kayak!  I just got into kayaking and love it.  Kayaks can range from $200 to thousands of dollars, but you can try them out for a great price ($10 an hour) through a group called  WoggWorks Kayaking  Also Canfield's rents for $30 for 24 hours.  There are a ton of lakes to check out including Cunningham, Zorinsky, Wehrspan, Prairie Queen, Walnut Creek, and Standing Bear."

Neither is your garage/yard or even most houses. Takes one kick to the door to get in to most houses.  I'm sure the cops are making this case a top priority.

The fact is that it is incredibly difficult to kill someone with a punch or kick.  You've got a list with a dozen fatalities, but there's been tens of thousands of mma fights.    What you're saying is just silly.  I don't know if you took a Tai Chi class and your sensei told you he could kill anyone with one punch or what, but you've been misinformed."

If you can plan this right, make sure you have a pay day between the visits so you can use some cash to offset the hit to your care credit.  Oh, and be prepared for a wait sometimes. They tend to be great for getting you into the office quick and but you can often wait a while depending on how busy they get with emergency appointments."

You are going to get teeth pulled, its gonna suck, and hurt and your going to have some serious pain not even just during the operations. Not a lot of places will do sedation because it's not really necessary and it's expensive. But I can say with 100% confidence that it's worth every painful second, self confidence improves tremendously. Hopefully you don't smoke and you have gotten in a habit of regularly brushing and flossing. I told myself it wasn't worth the time or money until I could commit to not smoking. My last appointment will mark my 3 years from quitting smoking.  Goodluck! It's totally worth it."

I can't say it's an enjoyable commute. It's bad enough in nice weather and I imagine it'd be worse in winter.   Bellevue and Papillion have some decent (and affordable) neighborhoods if you'd like a house. But if you want an apartment, I'd recommend looking at areas north of Offutt, like the Old Market/Midtown/Dundee. I go to school/work in that area, and the commute is a very easy 15-20 minutes. I've lived near Offutt for a long time, so I can answer any questions you have about the area!"

Omaha,3bt74k,jmhobbs,5,Thu Jul 2 01:46:43 2015 UTC,To touch on this point...  I lived in the Tiburon Apts off 168th & 370. Rent is really reasonable (approx $825 for a two bedroom) and the complex is really quiet and I never saw any crimes for the whole time I lived out there (approx 4 years). Really close to the interstate and a straight shot down 370 to Offutt.

Omaha,3bqy8p,syphilisisbad,7,Wed Jul 1 12:59:50 2015 UTC,"I went to school with her as well, and even lived with her for a while.  She was the best friend of my girlfriend after high school.  I was also friends with the father of her kid. It's been really tough for me."
Omaha,3bqy8p,CoinsForCharon,7,Wed Jul 1 14:51:11 2015 UTC,"Since a lot of you are saying you knew Jessyka, idk if you are her friend on fb (her sister posted it on her page yesterday) or if you even want to go, but they have scheduled her visitation/funeral. The visitation is Sunday from 3-7 at Roeder Mortuary and the funeral is Monday at 1, also at Roeder."

Omaha,3bqy8p,Broking37,6,Fri Jul 3 04:22:22 2015 UTC,Went to high school with her.   The lack of news details make me think they don't have much to go off of.
Omaha,3bqy8p,bnogo,8,Wed Jul 1 13:29:58 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it means they are working on building a solid case.. At least that's what I keep telling myself
Omaha,3bqy8p,marjsturgeon,3,Wed Jul 1 13:49:06 2015 UTC,That's probably all it is. Somebody had to know something so they probably are investigating suspects.
Omaha,3bqy8p,marjsturgeon,4,Wed Jul 1 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"I talked to them, I don't feel like I was much help. Hopefully somebody else was."

My cop buddy stated that the homicide unit is really tight lipped, so nothing will be disclosed for a while."
Omaha,3bqy8p,sevia121,5,Wed Jul 1 14:42:46 2015 UTC,yeah i worked with her for quite a while. Just a great person and it is driving me up the wall that they haven't released any real info.  I am hoping that is so the killer trips up and admits a detail no one knows. But this is just so disheartening
Omaha,3bqy8p,Satherton,5,Wed Jul 1 14:38:47 2015 UTC,When I talked to the detectives they said they aren't able to release any information pretty much for that reason and to reduce false confessions.

Omaha,3bw2p1,TheoreticalFunk,0,Thu Jul 2 23:06:57 2015 UTC,My point is that everyone has a different opinion of what's good and what's not.

Omaha,3bnsnn,bogartbrown,2,Wed Jul 1 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"The parade there is pretty fun if you have kids under 10. I swear every firefighting vehicle within 50 miles rolls through blaring their buzzers (God forbid a fire actually occurs at that time) and the shriners whip around in little Corvette go carts. Flags all throughout the town, etc. You feel a hundred miles away from Omaha.  Last time I was there (20 years or so) they did the fireworks at the golf course. Not a bad seat in the house. You were basically looking straight up.   Good times."

Omaha,3bnsnn,MrD3a7h,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that's a tough one.  If you're planning on skipping the parade, rolling into town late afternoon/early evening should find open spots in parking lots for businesses which are generally pretty chill about it but the actual fireworks aren't til 9ish.  I'd say cruise up and down the businesses on the access road by L street between 72nd & 84th street.  You should find something."

I know it's not so simple that one change will fix everything, but this is ridiculous.  I think it's exacerbated by zero community cooperation with the Police, but the community distrusts the police for past offenses... It's vicious circle."
Omaha,3bk9ff,dhess34,0,Tue Jun 30 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"There's a significant lack of development in North Omaha, and what development does occur is directed towards low income families.  It gives no incentive for decent educated people to move in, people who could have a positive influence in those around them.

I'll give you that the chances are high of this being black on black shooting, but perhaps you should reflect on how quickly you made those assumptions from no evidence and initiated some kind of debate about who is racist and speaking about one group vs another group."
Omaha,3bk9ff,creiss74,0,Tue Jun 30 03:40:07 2015 UTC,Calling people racist because you can't disprove violent crime data is this subs favorite pastime. Http://Dataomaha.com/homicides | http://ketv.com/news/16430886 | https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6 |Where do the majority of homicides take place in Omaha? Take note of the Murder/firearm charges on Ketvs website. What race are the accused? Notice how the murder rate is double for blacks killing whites? Now factor in that white people account for about 75% of the population in America. It's not racist. It's reality. Downvotes won't disprove the data.
Omaha,3bk9ff,WorkingClassGyr0,5,Tue Jun 30 08:08:29 2015 UTC,Your post makes no sense. Three random links followed by three questions which somehow lead to a declaration that no racism happened.  /u/creiss74 is responding to an obvious race-baiting post. Throwing up some statistics that take random snapshots of data with no context being used doesn't change that.
Omaha,3bk9ff,capedja,-3,Tue Jun 30 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"Random snapshots of data? The homicide map clearly shows where the majority of homicides in Omaha happen ( This sub is about Omaha). KETVS website can be used to see who has been charged with firearm violations/muder (This post is about a shooting in North Omaha) The only thing that could be considered random is the FBI statistics that show national numbers. My point is a statement such as ""The black community of North Omaha only have themselves to blame for the violence."" Is not racist if it's the truth. You don't need context with location data. If you can find a better source for gun violation arrests that shows the race of the accused I'd love to see it."
Omaha,3bk9ff,WorkingClassGyr0,3,Tue Jun 30 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"My point is a statement such as ""The black community of North Omaha only have themselves to blame for the violence.""

Since that isn't true, you are a racist at worst and a fucking idiot at best. This isn't harassment, by the way, just the nicest way I can explain this reality to you.

Omaha,3bk9ff,capedja,-1,Tue Jun 30 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"So is your argument that when a black male in Omaha shoots another black male it's white people's fault because of slavery/racism? Thats quite a leap if that is indeed your argument. I like how you had a problem with my ""random"" data with no context but the conext you want to provide is a white guilt article trying to make a case for reparations.  Thanks for proving my point by calling me racist :)"
Omaha,3bk9ff,WorkingClassGyr0,2,Wed Jul 1 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Sigh.  A) That article explains in literally painful (if you have a soul) detail that American society destroyed the families of, stole from, denied opportunities to, and even as of 2010 continued to defraud African Americans. So saying that ""The black community of North Omaha only have themselves to blame for the violence."" is demonstrably wrong unless you think that poverty and crime have no connection.  B) You say I call you a racist when I actually only posited that you could be a racist. I would now guess you are no more racist than anyone else but you sure are a fucking idiot. Learn to see the nuanced gray in the world. The only options aren't their fault or your fault, but you can be part of the solution or work against it."
Omaha,3bk9ff,capedja,-1,Wed Jul 1 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"If I have a soul? Haha! That's great. Poverty is not an exuse for murder or violence. Is poverty made them do it your argument? Scapegoating white people for the actions of black males is not an argument. No matter how many appeals to emotion you make. (if you have a soul rubbish) The black males commiting the majority of murders in this city always have and always will have the choice not to do so. The problem with nuance is it doesn't hold up well against statistics. Accounting for poverty only identifies what class of American society the perpetrator belongs to. It does not change the race of the perpetrator or their choice to commit the crime.  Oh! I'm sorry. You didn't actually call me racist, you only implied it. That is totally different. :)"
Omaha,3bk9ff,WorkingClassGyr0,2,Thu Jul 2 05:02:19 2015 UTC,"I could go on for hours showing you statistics on how African Americans are more likely to be stopped by cops, less likely to be hired with the same resumes, or any of the numerous statistics in the article I linked before (which you didn't read) that outline how the African American community has been forced into specific geographical regions, financially hamstrung, then had the jobs flee those regions. And you say, ""So? they should respond to poverty and institutional fuckery by being more upstanding than anyone else in that situation.""  I outline a problem, the multi-century fucking of a race of people, to explain the symptom, high violence in poor, black neighborhoods. There are no easy solutions to the problem, but America has been slowly correcting it and simply acknowledging it is still one of the best ways to fight it.  From what I can tell from your posts, your problem is ""black people are violent"" and your solution is ""black people should stop being violent.""  Never mind, I take it back. You are a fucking idiot AND a racist."

He and his family were basically trying to push her costs onto the taxpayers rather than sell farm land or other assets to pay for her care.  Cheesy and to my mind criminal, but something that farm families have tried to pull for a long time.  My mother was an RN in charge of a skilled facility and had a number of high cost and complexity patients who had assets to pay for their care, but the families were trying to hide.  One notable case was a woman whose daughter came in to the place bitching that she had to sell one of her 5 farms to pay for her several year long stay in a level 1 skilled nursing facility."

Omaha,3bjg39,boopdeeboo,3,Mon Jun 29 20:52:06 2015 UTC,Nursing student here. That's a very normal cost for a skilled nursing facility.
Omaha,3bjg39,boopdeeboo,7,Mon Jun 29 21:14:05 2015 UTC,"A skilled nursing facility requires a LPN be on site 24/7, and a RN for at least 8 hours a day. The residents in a skilled nursing facility typically have much more debilitating illnesses that affect their activities of daily living. This image does a good job of comparing a skilled nursing facility to an assisted living facility.  Also, I remember learning somewhere that, depending on the state and the patient's medical condition, hiring a private nurse to come to the resident's home each day can be cheaper than putting them in a facility.  Unfortunately, in the hospital, we just pray our patients who need rehabilitation or long-term care have health insurance other than Medicare. They're able to get into facilities with much better reputations."

Omaha,3bl60f,MildlyOffensiveAR,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:17:25 2015 UTC,"You're going to love Hummel Park's disc golf course. It's one of the best in the region. Beautiful layout placed in thick woods with serious elevation changes and water on about a quarter of the holes.  Seymour Smith is the most popular course in town, and if you don't mind waiting on each hole for 5-10 minutes most of the time, it's not bad. There are a few smaller courses that are OK for switching it up (Aspen Park, 9 hole, Cunningham, 8 hole). Iowa Western also has a course, but it's not free; they request a $1 donation for each round. I've never played Mahoney because I've heard nothing good about it. There are plenty of options in the Omaha-Lincoln area.  If you get a chance, drive down to Kansas City to play Waterworks and Swope. Waterworks is my favorite course; it's beautiful and challenging enough to host national tournaments."

The guy who put the course in is an awesome guy and runs the Coca Cola Classic Tournament Labor Day weekend.   Waterworks is a must though. I always play that course well. Rosedale is good too, try the down under part for more of a challenge. Swope is better now as the have been running tourneys there and Blue Valley is the big boy.

My friend and I played through holes(?) 1-17 literally without seeing anyone within 4 holes of us front or back. The only reason we ran into another group was when my disc got stuck in a tree. Unrelated but a guy from that group didn't even hesitate to climb this tree a good 40 feet up to get my disk, we even finished together. If you can go there between 3 and 6 I would say it's likely you won't run into too many people. Hole 9 had the basket moved back and is a ridiculously long par 4, but I still had a lot of fun. They did clear out the creek a little but honestly, still a very very enjoyable course. There's also one basket that I can't remember which number but it's in the middle going back uphill somewhere around #13, and the basket is hidden deep in the trees but other than that and  9 all baskets are fairly easy to spot."

It's the Great Plains! The back nine can be pretty treeless, and hazardless, but that's what the grass is for.. Part of the beauty of any type of golf is the terrain! You don't change the landscape, you fit the course to the challenges already present.. Being in a state park makes it one of the best maintained courses in the state.. Some of the tees and holes are confusing or mislabeled, but the guy at the gate has maps.. You should totally check it out..   Seymour-smith is nice and fun but super crowded, and kinda boring now that they cleared out that creek..   Hummel is awesome but intenese! It's a hike! Super fun if you're up for challenge..  IWCC is great! Well maintained, fun holes, usually pretty quiet.. They have a donation box, but $1 is more than worth it..  And there's a couple lil nine hole courses and Cunningham, which needs some help.. Lots of help really.. Used to be my fav spot, now it's just eight sad overgrown holes.. That's the course op should be tryin clean up!  A lot if the surrounding towns have courses now too! Lots of fun easy drives to different lil towns with fun courses.."

Omaha,3bf9nr,SabrinaFaire,2,Sun Jun 28 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"I've had plenty of issues with my Cox connection being unstable over the years but it's been pretty solid for a while now.  At first it was wildly undependable.  After several service calls they managed to get it straightened out, apparently some mice had gotten in the box behind my house and were chewing on some of the wires which screwed up the signal.  Years later I got some major undependability, I eventually upgraded to a DOCSIS 3.0 Modem I grabbed off Newegg, after that I've had zero issues.  I'll typically get about a 20ms ping, 120Mbps down and 12Mbps up.  Although in my area there aren't any better options so I'm stuck with Cox until someone decides to offer Gigabit in my neighborhood which probably won't happen any time soon.  I'd suggest calling them and letting them know how undependable it is and asking them check your signal strength.  If it's weak have them check out the infrastructure; If everything checks out from their end, get a new modem."
Omaha,3bf9nr,Blitzsturm,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:04:19 2015 UTC,I use Cox. Not the greatest but I keep hearing really bad things about century link. My parents had got cl and they wouldn't come back to bury the line for 4 months. It just laid across the yard.

My understanding is that it's illegal to tie up a dog for more than 15 minutes without a person present, perhaps someone actually watched the dog for that long before taking action.    Tying up a dog unsupervised doesn't really fly here (although a ton of people sure did it in Taiwan where I lived for a while).   I'd say it's to the benefit of dogs because some owners just don't realize how hot the concrete gets, and a tied up dog can't just get up and go somewhere more cool."

Omaha,3bdan2,MegabyteMcgee,0,Mon Jun 29 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is when I imagine myself as a dog, I would want a hell of a lot more out of life than leashes, water bowls, basements, kennels, and malnourished pellets for every meal of my entire life. I live in an apartment and almost every one has one/two dogs. I think it's ultimately selfish, and isn't different than what zoo's do to animals. I think proper care for a dog would include teaching him hunting, leaving him outside most of the time to roam, giving him something other than processed dried up beans to eat, letting him procreate and have a family, getting another dog as a playmate , etc. I don't know if it's relevant to this thread specifically, but I don't know why Ive felt pretty strongly about this lately and don't hear anyone else really talk about it.

Omaha,3bdan2,sputnikleroy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:42:34 2015 UTC,Sure those are all ideal conditions to have a dog raised in but can't be a prerequisite to owning one. If it was they would have to kill most dogs because very few people can meet all of those conditions. If I was a dog I might just be happy to be alive and have food and a back yard and air conditioning and a loving owner. Shit I don't know any unhappy dogs personally. You also have to take into account all dogs are different from breed to breed and dog to dog. My bichon/poodle won't make much of a hunter and is much happier inside during the day and sleeping in my bed at night then roaming free. I hear what you are saying though.

Omaha,3balli,couchjitsu,2,Sat Jun 27 15:31:16 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what to do with leftover fireworks?
Omaha,3balli,Torque64,2,Sat Jun 27 18:10:20 2015 UTC,"Usually a week or so after July 4th the police sponsor a ""fireworks amnesty day"" where you can bring your old/leftover fireworks and they will dispose of them, no questions asked.   I think you can bring your spare fire arms too and they will take care of them."
Omaha,3balli,GreenManfromMars,2,Sat Jun 27 22:35:19 2015 UTC,Here is the official flyer we are required to give every customer. http://imgur.com/PwXRgqG
Omaha,3balli,Broking37,2,Sat Jun 27 18:32:33 2015 UTC,"What's odd is that flyer is different than what it states on the OPD website others have posted.  -OPD says they may be discharged from 6/25 to 7/4, and your flyer says 6/25 to 7/5. -Also your flyer is a bit confusing when it comes to 16 year olds, first saying they may own and discharge and then saying they must be with someone 19+. So it isn't clear whether a 16 year old can light fireworks independently. OPD website is a bit more clear (they can)"
Omaha,3balli,diastataxic,3,Sat Jun 27 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"This is my first summer living in Omaha (I'm around Dundee), and I'll admit that I was surprised to hear our neighbors setting the damn things off until well after 11pm. It just seems weird to me that you're allowed to set off fireworks within city limits.  I'm not one to call or complain, it's just different. I'm happy to learn that they have a short season - now I know when to plan my summer vacation next year."

Omaha,3b95ly,veryalias,5,Sat Jun 27 03:07:48 2015 UTC,I created /r/OmahaMusic two years ago and just kind of forgot about it because of negative response from /r/Omaha. Maybe I'm not the right person to be the mod. I'm a musician and I've always been unsure promoting and discussing music here.

Omaha,3b95ly,tjfoxx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"Well man that depends, are you going to post every week for each new gig?  Keep in mind no mater how great your music is, expect at 90% of the people aren't into your jam, and don't want to see your upates."
Omaha,3b95ly,Kezika,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but bands still shouldn't be discouraged to post in this sub.  Flooding it with updates is ridiculous I agree which is why I would encourage people to follow the band if they are into them.  Bigger shows come up and why not promote it along with the other bands involved.  Part of encouraging growth and in a sense marketing this city to people visiting or that aren't familiar is to promote all aspects. Not just food, certain hangouts, and the typical things to do even though those are great things to promote.  There can always be more, especially with the nightlife part of it."
Omaha,3b95ly,tjfoxx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"Your flood is another man's gentle rain.  If I hear about a band doing something new, or I hear about some out of the ordinary event, I will take note of it, even if it is not something I am into.  If you want to post every gig you do, then you are a source of spam.  And you should get treated just like all the other spam sources."
Omaha,3b95ly,ptrcknwmn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"But I never once said anything about posting every gig.  I agree with this if your have a gig several times a month.  Posting once to encourage people to follow or come out to a show shouldn't be discouraged.  As you said though posting over and over again would understandably get annoying.  However, that would only apply to one band.  You have several bands posting roughly the same time its not fair to the last band that posted that they may be considered spamming the sub."
Omaha,3b95ly,dataflux,2,Sun Jun 28 18:19:36 2015 UTC,While you're asking mods about this would you mind asking why there isn't a calendar of events in the sidebar? Seems like it would be a great addition since a good chunk of posts here are asking about things to do.
Omaha,3b95ly,riverfan,2,Thu Jul 2 23:57:52 2015 UTC,I think that would be an amazing thing.  It would be alot of work but an all emcompassing/continously updated list of significant events.  Anything from music to movies to even stuff like the zombie walk would be awesome.
Omaha,3b95ly,Starsintosun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:37:06 2015 UTC,Maybe you should message the mods and find out for sure.

Omaha,3b95ly,riverfan,2,Mon Jun 29 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not complaining about my past posts self promoting my band.  I was told at that time that while I may find some support, the more likely case is that it is going to get downvoted.   I made the choice to post and the results were out of my control.  I did not promote excessively unless making a post stating the date, time, venue, and just saying if no one has anything better to do then show up is excessive then I guess I have no words to say to that.  I was simply asking if things have changed since the revolt and if there has been more support for people to self promote their works in various avenues."

Omaha,3b89dd,bezald,2,Thu Jul 2 06:17:32 2015 UTC,"89.7 The River calls themselves ""The Cutting Edge of Rock"" and so they play rock and alternative.  As JJ, he did a lot of evening and late night shifts (that is when the students in the Media Studies Program worked).  He was a River at Night deejay, so it was a lot of harder rock.  Sometimes he had me call in during his shifts to be ""Party Girl"" and he would put me on air to give updates on parties that were happening in the area.   Jammin' Jason was his handle when he did sports I believe."

Omaha,3b89dd,bezald,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:14:16 2015 UTC,I'm not from Omaha... is the general public still aware of this case or is it totally off the radar? Are there rumors about what happened?
Omaha,3b89dd,bezald,2,Thu Jul 2 06:13:05 2015 UTC,"I would say that it is basically off the radar.  One of the news stations did a segment a few weeks ago about it, how it has been 14 years and still unsolved.  That might have revived an interest for some, or piqued an interest for those who weren't here 14 years ago.  Omaha is pretty busy these days with various murders, shootings and gang issues, so I'm thinking this is not at the top of anyone's list.  :("

Turns out, that the type of pig used for rashers is entirely different from those that are supplied here for bacon, beside the fact that it's also a different cut. Best bet is to buy bacon from behind the counter. Black pudding and English Bangers can be found at Stoysich House of Sausage on 24th. There is Nothing like a Full English Breakfast!"

Then I thought, '""well what if there is something wrong with my car, and he is trying to tell me?"" So I rolled down my window and asked ""is there something wrong with my car"" he said ""no baby, what are you doing? You should come with me baby"" I almost threw up.

Or maybe him spending all that money on lethal injection drugs was a ploy to try and make senators vote for keeping the death penalty: ""We already spent the money on the drugs, you cant change the law now!"". I dont know, whatever his thought on that were it was childish and a reckless move. Now that the death penalty is gone and the FDA isn't even letting the drugs into this country that we imported, the result is Ricketts threw over $50,000 of our tax dollars down the shitter.  Also its worthy noting that for the gay rights issue he is strickly opposed to gay rights even though his sister is a lesbian. I don't know if you want to mention that in your paper but its just something i found interesting that he would be so staunchly opposed to something like gay marriage that his sister Laura Ricketts is fighting for. And then he'll go on to talking about Nebraska family values when he doesn't even seem to give a shit about the rights of one of his own family members.  Honestly my view on Ricketts in general is that he is stuck in his own beliefs and pushing his own agenda and is not willing to even consider anyone else's ideas. I'd also say his obssession with trying to put the death row inmates to death even after the death penalty has been repealed is cynical and sadistic. I could probably give you a couple more ideas if you'd like but i don't really have the time to type them out tonight so just let me know if i could be of any more help because I've done a lot of thought, research and discussing this issue with a lot of people because i honestly fucking hate Pete Ricketts.

Omaha,3asrbd,Zack4568,2,Tue Jun 23 05:24:10 2015 UTC,Two Rivers SRA is good.   Check the Nebraska Game and Parks site for a complete list of all fishing lakes.
Omaha,3asrbd,peesteam,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:26:34 2015 UTC,"Zorinsky is bouncing back.  They drew the lake down a few years ago and treated it with rotanone to stop a zebra mussel infestation.  They've been stocking it since, there should be some good fish in there at this point.  Then there's Wherspann down in Chalco, which has some good fishing as well.  Plenty of bank fishing opportunities at both of these lakes, as well as well maintained boat ramps.  Walnut creek in LaVista is also a good choice.    Scheels has live bait including minnows, and I'm pretty sure there's still a bait shop out by Two Rivers in Venice... Used to be called Dowd's but that was 20 some years ago, I think it's changed it's name.  If you want to take a day trip Sherman and Calmus reservoirs are not a bad drive, and offer good fishing, if you want to keep fish going outside the city is the best option,  local lakes face a lot of fishing pressure.  I like going up to Yankton for a weekend and fish below the dam, and if you have a boat, and its stable or it's not windy, there's very good fishing in the Lewis and Clark Lake above the dam.  It's a big lake, so you have to find them, but usually get good action on Walleyes near the campgrounds on the NE side, and the Boy scout camp on the SD side.  There's also Lake Yankton up there, which is an oxbow created when they built the dam, but they just treated that lake last fall, so the fish are just coming back there.  In a couple years that lake should have some very good fishing.  Above all, check out http://nefga.org/  It's a great community with lots of good information on all things relating to Nebraska hunting and fishing."

We need a strong automated light rail system, -separate- from the traffic (elevated, since burying parts of it are probably not feasible), and actually takes you across Omaha at speeds the bus can't do.  Put one going all the way north and south on 24th and east and west on  Dodge for starters, then as funds come in add L / Ames and 72nd/100andsomething light rails and make the busses come off them like spokes and you'll have something.  The layout and distance this actually covers is built more for tourists than the citizens that actually live here."
Omaha,3am057,FyreWulff,3,Sun Jun 21 15:38:07 2015 UTC,built more for tourists than the citizens that actually live here.   Isn't that why we're all here?  We're just a life support system for the college world series. It's most fulfilling this time of year isn't it?
Omaha,3am057,arrachion,0,Sun Jun 21 20:17:37 2015 UTC,"No, we don't. Such a thing would cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in construction and labor costs, traffic delays due to construction on or near roadways, et cetera. The associated gains would be small - you'd move a couple hundred or thousand commuters in and out every day, and you'd be stealing LOTS of money from every Omaha resident to support such a boondoggle. There's simply not a single example in the world of a city as sparse as Omaha operating a profitable rail-based transit system.  Mass transit systems seem like a cool idea, but they're a waste in the overwhelming majority of places. They only make sense when you have an insanely high population density, very high economic output, lots of foot-mobile people. Omaha has none of those things. Compare the density of Omaha to lower Manhattan if you want to giggle. Such systems are a complete waste in Atlanta and Detroit and it'd be a waste here too. You'd be far better off adding more lanes, modern intersection designs, improved traffic engineering, et cetera, than stealing from people to build an idea that sounds good on paper but has no empirical evidence for this particular use case."
Omaha,3am057,shellsonthefloor,3,Mon Jun 22 02:04:34 2015 UTC,"There's simply not a single example in the world of a city as sparse as Omaha operating a profitable rail-based transit system.   Salt Lake City has a light-rail and they seem to be doing well enough to have greatly expanded their service areas in the last 10 years, including adding long-distance commuting stations from surrounding counties, north and south of SLC. Both SLC and Omaha are of a similar size (in square mileage and in population).   Modernizing Omaha's infrastructure is important, and light commuter rail should be  considered to be included in that modernization, providing that MAT doesn't screw the pooch in the process by cutting bus routes. Having an airport/ballpark/convention center route would be a very good rail route to have on the map, with a connecting line station on Dodge, and going south on 13th to have a stop at the zoo, and in the future, expanding all the way to the Offutt area to get commuters from Bellevue. The other major route which would be useful would be a Dodge/Farnam route (whichever street would be less busy/shut down by the construction). Since Dodge has many major stops (malls, university, museums)  along/near it, having the rail on a nearby street, like Farnam wouldn't heavily impede existing traffic, and most rail-riders don't have a problem walking/riding to their final destination; perhaps stopping first at Boys Town (which already has a park n ride nearby, last I recall), and eventually expanding out to Elkhorn. Those two lines seem rather tourist-centric, but those places are where they go in Omaha, and easily getting them shuttled to and fro would alleviate traffic, since a rail car can carry many more people than a dozen cars.  There is a lot of potential in light rail and the idea of light rail is feasible, but Omaha is SO dependent on cars that it seems to get shot down every time someone brings it up. There are successful ways to implement a light rail/bus system, and finding working models/systems like UTA (Utah Transit Authority) would work well for Omaha, providing that public transit services are greatly expanded over what is currently used.  Apologies for the wall of text, but I really liked the light rail in Salt Lake, and it'd be great if Omaha could emulate their bus/light rail system."

There is literally no way you are living in the United States and not enjoy the life you live without using stuff other people paid for that you contributed nothing to."
Omaha,3am057,FyreWulff,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"Nobody is under the threat of death for not paying taxes   If you don't pay your taxes, they will kidnap you and take you to jail. If you resist kidnapping (and who wouldn't, if they could), they will keep using greater and greater force against you. They will go all the way up to shooting you if that's the force they need to overcome your resistance. The system doesn't function because everyone agrees to it, the system functions because there are men with guns who are willing to use those guns to overcome noncompliance. If the guns were never going to be used, they wouldn't be much of a motivator!  You can't charge people for services they didn't ask you to provide. Period. Not morally, anyway. That's called extortion. Refer again to my moat example.  Somalia is not a libertarian dreamland, that's a strawman everyone throws around, it's no more true than saying ""North Korea is a statist's paradise"". Somalia is run by psychopathic violent warlords, whereas the US is run by a violent (but predictable, non-psychopathic) group of thugs. A libertarian dreamland would have no taxes, no theft, no robbery, no fraud. No non-voluntary interactions between adults of any kind. Taxes aren't voluntary. The obscene majority of government functions are not voluntary in one way or another. Warlords taking your stuff and raping you is not voluntary. Etc."

Omaha,3amtut,WeaverofClouds,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"I live around midtown, and work out West.  I have taken both I-80 and Dodge routes over the last 3 years and both can get backed up.  Where I-480 meets I-80 it can be a little congested in the mornings.  Definitely think about taking I-80 when it snows, there always seems to be someone who struggles to make it up the hills near UNO, and that can delay traffic.  Consider this, Midtown Crossing to Boys Town is about 10 miles on Dodge, compared to 16 miles on I-80.  So roughly 1.5 times as far.  If you don't mind spending a little extra money on gas, then definitely try out I-80.  Just be aware of the extra distance, 10 miles per day for work doesn't seem like much, but it is an extra 2,500 miles and maybe $200 more in gas each year."

Dodge will probably be no issue, but you'll only have two lanes in your direction until 70th St.  Interstate should be smooth sailing for you with one issue regarding PM traffic.  Depending on traffic congestion, there can be a slow spot that builds around the 84th St. exit because people forget how to accelerate up the hill between there and 72nd St."

Omaha,3agd04,minaccia,3,Fri Jun 19 23:40:14 2015 UTC,Can confirm. UNO has ranked top 5 nationally in veteran friendly schools for the past few years. Veteran's office is a huge help as far as education benefits go. Absolutely loved that group of people.  Source: recent grad and army vet

They do not care what school you go to thwy juat want to help vets. I think that may be worth tour time to check even if nothing pans out from it.

There's way more bars, restaurants, and attractions down there then there ever was at Rosenblatt.

Rosenblatt had character, but the tents were grungy, the souvenirs were pretty low quality, the walkways were narrow, and the people selling parking were aggressive.

Omaha,3aefim,bootybuddhist,-1,Fri Jun 19 18:02:31 2015 UTC,The cost of the stadium and the cost of the TIF financing for the stuff around that have never been publicly discussed.  These would be interesting numbers.  The social impact of turning NODO into a 2 week a year festival site and leaving the rest of the year pretty empty is also not considered.
Omaha,3aefim,riverfan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:52:12 2015 UTC,There's also Berkshire weekend. Other than that we don't have much.
Omaha,3aefim,venom_dP,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:29:23 2015 UTC,I seem to recall lots of discussion over the financing/costs...  And doesn't Creighton play baseball there? They had the Nighthawks for a season or two; they've held the outdoor hockey games. They use the stadium when they can.
Omaha,3aefim,mjconns,3,Fri Jun 19 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"Creighton has their own baseball field, but they use TD park sometimes.   Every Creighton home game was / is played at TD Ameritrade Park. (With a few exceptions for games versus North Dakota.)"
Omaha,3aefim,placebotwo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:54:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree for a second that Fahey and his friends financially benefited. But that doesn't mean it isn't a better location and will have a better impact, with more room to expand, etc downtown."
Omaha,3aefim,mjconns,6,Fri Jun 19 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"Nobody is going to want to rent the Convention Center during CWS season, either, so we lost income from moving it down there.   The 2012 Olympic Swim trials were held at the same time as the 2012 CWS and it was a resounding success on both sides, so much that the 2016 trials will be returning to Omaha.  So yes, it's apparent that your bias is blind."
Omaha,3aefim,placebotwo,6,Fri Jun 19 20:03:53 2015 UTC,But it wasn't a problem. For anyone.
Omaha,3aefim,placebotwo,5,Fri Jun 19 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"but the location is terrible   How so? It's closer to the airport, hotels, restaurants, etc.   They had to take away a whole parking lot from the Convention Center to even fit it in down there. Nobody is going to want to rent the Convention Center during CWS season, either, so we lost income from moving it down there.   So there's a whole two weeks that would be dual-booked? And whose to say the convention center wouldn't want cross-over traffic from people already in town for the CWS? If they did want to avoid ALL overlap, fine, there's 50 other weeks to choose from. It's a null impact.  A couple years ago there was some overlap from CWS-Olympic swim trials that people freaked out over but there was no real issues at all.   I don't believe that stadium will survive the end of it's lease. They're probably going to build yet another one out West after the Arena ages out and we build a replacement for that one, too.   Believe what you want, but that isn't based in any form of reality. They'll use, renovate, and keep the current location much, much longer than Rosenblatt. The location is far too valuable now to move it in the next 50 years+, assuming CWS stays in Omaha for that long."
Omaha,3aefim,mjconns,2,Fri Jun 19 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"CWS contract expires in 2030. And there's no way the NCAA will let the stadium stay the way it is for very long.   Yes, I understand that. Hence the ""if it stays in Omaha"" bit. From everything they've said, the NCAA are very happy with the current stadium. Other than renovations as needed, what leads you to believe they won't ""let the stadium stay the way it is for very long""? If you mean exponential growth and success, I would have to assume they'll be quite pleased with that. There's no signs of anything but increased success.  2030 is only 15 years away. The stadium will not be in disrepair by then. Yes, basic maintenance will be done annually; maybe some renovation to spruce the place up. But the CWS will not move out of its current location in 2030 based on the NCAA disliking the location.  If you truly believe otherwise, you're letting your bias blind you."
Omaha,3aefim,mjconns,3,Fri Jun 19 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"Roseblatt was poorly designed and poorly located. The current stadium has an excellent designe and the best location available in Omaha. The stadium/location will not be the reason if the CWS leaves Omaha in 2030. Your bias is obviously blinding any sound judgment or logic that you might otherwise poses, it's not really worth discussing it with you any further."

Omaha,3agq80,racer91,4,Sat Jun 20 00:48:16 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to assume the entirety of Douglas County (minus Ralston) is going to be Omaha in a few decades.  lol at that resident thinking being annexed is going to make their neighborhood no longer peaceful and quiet. It's just changing who's name is on the bottom of the tax bills.
Omaha,3agq80,FyreWulff,5,Sat Jun 20 10:56:18 2015 UTC,"Annexation is what keeps Omaha from falling into St Louis' problem of being ringed by small communities who don't have to pay taxes for the support of the inner city.  STL can't afford to support it and play the govt financing games it needs to in order to compete with the burbs.  Either they let the ghettos slide deeper, or they watch moving trucks haul more of the industrial base away."
Omaha,3agq80,riverfan,2,Sat Jun 20 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what OP was trying say with that headline...   That said the residents who are up in arms are a joke. This smAcks of every libertarian ever: 'We don't need you, we're self-sufficient, and live by our own lil' rules!'. Yeah, except the only reason your life is remotely civilized is because you're leaching off the city, wether you admit it or not. If your SID existed in BFE Nebraska, you'd all be living in farmhouses without modern conveniences, unless you paid 10-15x the taxes you currently pay. Anyone who knows anything about local government knows that these annexations are necessary, and inevitable."
Omaha,3agq80,dhess34,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:26:15 2015 UTC,There's plenty of big nice new houses out in the country with well water and septic system. And much lower property tax than Douglas co.
Omaha,3agq80,dataflux,0,Sun Jun 21 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"Take my parents neighborhood that up for annexation. The neighborhood streets are not up to code. If the city annexes them they would have to widen them all for their trucks to get through. Who mows the common area between houses? Omaha parks and rec? Or do they let the homeowners keep it and add it to their property value? What are they going to do with their sewer system? It's out of code but flowing into omahas sewer technically. There's another neighborhood on their annexation list that I know for a fact that has a well. How is the city going to fix that?   Oh and let us Not forget how lovely their snow removal service is, last time they annexed stufd they had this street problem and told a certain community to wheel their trash cans to the end of the cul DE sac in the street because the trash truck couldn't fit. Ya no."
Omaha,3agq80,dhess34,3,Sun Jun 21 13:55:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not refuting a word I said. Your parents are benefitting hugely from existing in the metro (say, their jobs?), the city's just making sure the rest of us aren't subsidizing their life."
Omaha,3agq80,dataflux,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"You have it completely backwards. The 5 fig property tax on a 3 bed house is subsidizing the apartment dwellers, over-funded schools, unrealistic pensions, excess public employees, bond debt, and corporate tax breaks that ""create"" the jobs and everything else. ""The city"" = tax payers and tax payer backed debt."
Omaha,3agq80,dhess34,2,Sun Jun 21 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"Also, I find it hilarious when people around here whine about snow removal. Move to a real city (Chicago, for example), and you'll learn real quick that Omaha's pretty damn good about clearing streets in a timely manner."

Omaha,3ad199,placebotwo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"I'll try this too.  I don't think there would be an issue with multiple FIV cats being together.

Omaha,3abp26,ThatGuyYouKnow,6,Thu Jun 18 20:14:57 2015 UTC,A contract requires a signature.    File a complaint against Cox.  https://ago.nebraska.gov/forms/consumer_complaint
Omaha,3abp26,TheoreticalFunk,6,Thu Jun 18 22:04:19 2015 UTC,I don't see how they would have access  to your account to add services. This seems more sketchy on Cox's side.
Omaha,3abp26,Broking37,3,Thu Jun 18 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"Take a look at your lease and verify that it doesn't allow them to just willy nilly add new monthly fees. If that $40 fee was not in the lease when you signed it and there isn't some provision in there basically saying that the landlord can add whatever fee they want for any reason at any time then you aren't required to pay that fee as it is not part of your lease. A lawyer would be able to browse your lease and let you know if the lease contains a required $40 monthly cable bill or if you're required to pay it for certain.  Also as TheoreticalFunk said, a service contract with an ISP/TV provider requires a signature, if you didn't sign a document agreeing to service until December you didn't agree to service until December."
Omaha,3abp26,Kezika,2,Thu Jun 18 22:14:51 2015 UTC,They made it so that the fee was added on when you signed your new lease. (I live in Vanderbilt).
Omaha,3abp26,huskergirlie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if I remember correctly on the date of implementation it was shortly before Labor Day last year which means there could still be some residents that do not have the fee on their current lease and if OP is one such resident they would not be required to pay the amenity fee if it is not on their current lease agreement. The apartment would need to hold off until they have a contract in place with Op stipulating the monthly amenities fee.  Although from the sounds of the OPtext this isn't the case and he moved in after the implementation of the amenities fee, in which case he should check the lease in how it states that account will be set up. The apartment in any case I don't believe should be able to add cable to any pre-existing Cox account, and the apartment would have had to set it up in a similar manner to how apartment complexes set up OPPD accounts for their residents by having it technically owned by the apartment complex but in the name of th resident."
Omaha,3abp26,Kezika,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"They don't do anything with residents' Cox accounts, and they obtain the basic cable through Cable Choice, who then obtains it from Cox (messy if you ask me), I believe.   In this situation, the issue seems to be with Cox, not Richdale (for once)."
Omaha,3abp26,huskergirlie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"In either case Richdale requiring residents to have a cable package is still just fucking weird and doesn't ""smell"" right.  I was actually looking into Lionshead for a bit right before they implemented it and that was a dealbreaker. I don't watch TV. I don't find the medium to be entertaining, it simply doesn't interest me. I'm not fucking paying $40 for something I am literally never going to use."
Omaha,3abp26,Kezika,2,Fri Jun 19 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"They claim it's an ""amenities"" fee and includes the gym access (for the Biltmore gym) and all the other shit they think people care about, but it really is just for the cable, because it's the exact same thing they were charging people who wanted cable before, only now they're requiring it."
Omaha,3abp26,huskergirlie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:48:45 2015 UTC,Yeah see and I never use apartment gyms/business centres/required cable subscriptions/theaters/clubhouse/etc. Still not gonna pay $40 for something that I never use and every other apartment in the city with those throw in as part of the lease.
Omaha,3abp26,Kezika,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. Most bulk accounts are the apartment paying and the residents have no charge. If you add on additional services (like internet) the account shows up in your name when you call but the bulk services shows ""$0"" on the bill you get.  I can't think of a way a complex could easily sign up everyone with an account they are liable for without a ton of work."

Omaha,3abp26,HeartsOverHalos,2,Sat Jun 20 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know the legality behind it, but it does seem messed up since they put you under contract that extends beyond your lease. I'm guessing they covered their asses in something they had you sign when you moved in. I've heard Richdale is pretty shady. It's a shame because their properties always look so nice."
Omaha,3abp26,Erinsays,2,Thu Jun 18 22:07:56 2015 UTC,Richdale is pretty well known for their fuckery.  They are one management group that you want to avoid at all costs.
Omaha,3abp26,Conchobair,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"I'd check your lease and see what it stipulates regarding Cox cable. I remember Richdale attempting to add this amenities change when I renewed my least last year. It was one of many reasons I left, Richdale is a terrible company and I would never rent from them again."
Omaha,3abp26,zsb123,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that you didn't inadvertently sign up for a cable add-on with your internet subscription as part of a deal which Cox was running, or something like that?   That would seem more likely than some conspiracy by Richdale to impersonate you and add services to your bill. Cox won't even talk to you about your account unless you give them an account PIN."
Omaha,3abp26,ShellAnswerMan,3,Fri Jun 19 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"No, it is actually a known thing that Lionshead Apartments did a while back. Last year in late July early August if I remember the date correctly they started doing where they just signed you up with Cox internet and cable when you moved in. It would be an account like how apartments normally handle OPPD account. It is in your name, but set up by the apartment complex.  It's relatively known and there was a big stink about it last year when they started it among their residents. If you look at apartment rating sites there are also plenty of reviews from residents related to it."
Omaha,3abp26,Kezika,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:24:10 2015 UTC,This makes sense. I would check that lease because that sounds horrible. It's like the opposite of bulk services. And signing people up in a contract is shady because they are usually two years long.

They already have a lot of the info needed to open an account. Name, full social to run a credit check (for deposits). I wouldn't call it shady on Cox's part. We have no way to verify who you are when you call. You have the info? Good. I would think setting up a whole complex would get flagged (and be a ton of work). They should have set up a bulk account like you said where no names are on the accounts. If it were me I would call, find out if someone called to set it up and ask to get the call pulled. Don't let this go!"

We need to take responsibility for ourselves and quit worrying about forcing others to comply with our personal idea of how things should be.

Omaha,3ad8n8,riverfan,7,Fri Jun 19 13:18:46 2015 UTC,"Lincoln is a boring town full of college know it all's and people working for the state.  Omaha is our country's freistadt.  We are dismissed by outsiders and hated by other Nebraskans.  The outcome is that our city is organic.  It is not trying to be hip or follow some lame trend.  It is what the people who live here want it to be.  Social change happens here, but not the way OP wants.  This instantly makes OP look odd and people discount you.  If you want change in an organic city, make something new that fits and genuinely makes something better.  You get change.  Craft beer in Omaha is a classic example of organic change.  First, there are none.  Then, a few places open and make craft beer, but only for their restaurants.  They go nowhere.  Most fold.  They never figured out cans or bottles.  Then Lucky Bucket comes along with actual bottles and six packs.  Market need for practical containers is met (organic meeting of needs for good beer in practical volumes) and profit is made.  Other brewers follow this path.  Now, we have bunches of people making lots of interesting beers and lots of local stores selling them in convenient, practical manners.  Social change is that craft beers are not oddities to drink on special occasions anymore."

I wouldn't normally get my hopes up for something like that in Nebraska, but considering the recent change of policy regarding the death penalty....perhaps attitudes are changing.   Of course, this isn't truly a 'prohibition of torture' but, assuming the final bill makes it past the presidents desk with this amendment attached, the next president or congress will have a harder time ignoring/repealing this than they would Obama's executive order.

They report that it's an amendment with broad bi-partisan support, spearheaded by McCain, and more republicans in the senate voted for it than against it. All of the 21 senators who voted against it are members of the GOP. These are just facts. They look bad because they voted against even moderate restrictions on the use of torture. If democrats were voting nay on this, they'd look just as bad.   There haven't actually been many articles about this amendment and when I did a quick search for news about the bill, the guardian's writeup was more thorough than the others I found. However, If the guardian is so horrid for you, there are other sources that have written about this, though with less info:  The Atlantic  The Hill  CNN  I somehow doubt you'll find these any more acceptable, and the Atlantic post is clearly an editorial without much substance, but there really isn't a whole lot to say here beyond the content of the amendment and listing the people who voted for/against it.   Here's the text of the amendment.  Here's the executive order that it's based on: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations  The original link lists everyone who voted for and against it.

They tend to never run more than $50 a month, have practical self defense*, and gernally offer better workouts than Tae Kwon Do/Karate/Kuk Sool Won/Kung Fu places do. Brazilian Jiu Jistu generally runs in the range $150+ a month so it's probably out of your range. Though if you can find a Luta Livre school(not Lucha Livre) they tend to be a bit cheaper, and it's essentially the same thing.   *By practical self defense, I mean some where that will help you keep your head straight in a dangerous situation and won't tell you to do things that will get you hurt. The most important thing is that the school have contact sparring and resisting opponents, if they don't it's basically a themed cardio kickboxing class. Don't get me wrong if that's what you want go for it, I did Tae Kwon Do for three years and Aiki Jistu for two before learning how much bullshit actually is taught in those places. 99% of the self defense taught there only ever works against an opponent who is complying with you. What happened is I had moved onto Aiki Jistu(what Stephen Segal uses if that tells you anything) when I started University after doing Tae Kwon Do for all of High School. I signed up for ""combative sports"" for my phys ed requirement, which turned out to be a Judo course run by the Major who ran the universities ROTC program. Myself still being fully immersed in the LARP that is Aiki Jistu, and riding high from my TKD black belt thinking I was tough shit because I had a two shiny gold stripes on my belt, arrive at my first day of Judo to learn that everything that I had learned in the previous four years was complete bullshit. I actually had the nerve to complain that during a drill my opponent wouldn't fall down like he was supposed to when I did the move. After that I moved onto Judo for a year, loved it, moved to the east coast where I started BJJ and Muay Thai, moved back to finish university where I picked up boxing, an did a couple of supplemental Luta Livre classes.   On that note, stay away from Tae Kwon Do, Karate, Ninjistu or Kung Fu places. There are always outliers, but 95% of them are black belt factories that will take your money in return for 2-3 hours of lack luster cardio per week, in which you might actually break a sweat along during the warm up. If a school has belt fees, testing fees, black belts under the age of 12(rule of thumb is the younger the black belt the worse the school), no sparring at all, point sparring(just as bad as no sparring, don't believe the ""it takes more skill to pull a punch/kick than to actually punch/kick bullshit), or the guy/gal who runs the school is a master(ie 9th degree black belt) and seems kinda young, or has a certificate from the Worlds Martial Arts Hall of Fame. Walk out the door and never look back. This is an old site that looks very outdated, but the information is still good on telling you what you want to stay away from. http://mcdojo-faq.tripod.com/"

Omaha,3a6qnp,22cthulu,3,Wed Jun 17 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"I suggest Omaha Kali Academy - omahakali.com.  It's pretty chill with a small, tight knit group, yet very welcoming to new people.  I trained for several years there and loved my time (it was also very affordable), but haven't been in a while due to playing hockey instead.  However, my brother still trains there a couple times a week.    Dean is the instructor.  He definitely knows his stuff and instructs with a philosophical purpose.  He also makes sure to keep the tough guy attitude to a minimum as it's more important to learn and exercise than having to worry about getting your head caved in by some kind of wanna be MMA guy.  Don't get me wrong, if you want to get into competing in MMA or Jiu Jitsu, he will certainly get you ready.  What I, personally, enjoyed the most with Dean is his knowledge of JKD and various Filipino arts (boxing and weapons).  He is certified under Dan Inosanto, who is a famous Bruce Lee protege.  He knows the art front to back.  Give him a call, he's a good dude."
Omaha,3a6qnp,22cthulu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Kali is a lot of fun. It's not for self defense, unless you walk around with Rattan on a regular basis. I don't know about this guy specifically but my Biological father teaches Arnis(basically the same as Kali) down in Oklahoma, and two of the three times I met the guy it was at his school and I had a lot of fun. They're these moments when you're hitting the sticks hard enough that you start to get this strong burning wood smell permeating the room, and it's amazing. I would have gone on a regular basis, but it was over an hour drive one way, and whilst he's a great guy it's kind of awkward to be taught by your biological father that I only found out about when I was 23. But on the bright side he gave me some sticks and said he'd let me train for free if I wanted.   For his school at least, banging sticks around was a lot fun, but outside of stick work, when they did things like take downs there was a lot of stuff that rarely worked without an unresisting opponent. And I had to hold my tongue a couple of times like when they had these double edged wooden knife things and they would practice blocking by bracing the knife with their off hand by placing their palms on the back edge of the knife. Or when he had to show me(who had been boxing for two years at this point) how to punch ""properly"" because the way I was doing it wouldn't allow him to show off the special Arnis blocking techniques. Like any boxer, my fist comes back to the guard position as fast, if not faster than it goes out for a punch, and he(and later my training partner) couldn't grab my wrist."

If you want to pay higher price you will live near higher end people.
Omaha,3a6dro,Zindel1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"I will second this. They tried to scam me back when I lived there. They tried to pull a fast one on me at a renewal time after I had already lived there 3 years with them and I caught them in it. (They told me on multiple phone calls leading up to the time that the price to go month-to-month was x. Day came to sign renewal and they were like ""Oh sorry it's actually $x+75, we never told you it was $x"" and then I played them a phone recording of them saying it and told them to honor that verbal agreement or I'm moving out immediately.) They will also put in very odd and frivolous charges when you move out so they can take your deposit. Their charges for me were very so conveniently 18 cents less than the deposit. Including things like a 5 dollar charge to replace a burnt out light bulb. Charging me for the leaking garbage disposal that I had called them in about on a nearly monthly basis since I had moved in there. They are also simply not cost effective for what you get when compared to other apartments at a ""things per dollar"" level. I currently live at Briarwood Apartments, which give you a lower per square foot rate. Better maintained buildings and facilites. Friendlier office staff, and better and more appliances for your dollar. If you do go there, record fucking everything you talk with them on and realize that their maintenence department operates in band-aid mode due to underfunding. (The maintenence guy is really nice and actually wants to fix shit but they don't authorize him to do needed stuff if it's more than sticking duct tape over a leak.) Another maintenence example. My air conditioner in the closet had a panel that was broken off, I kept having to have them come and tape it back on because they wouldn't let him replace that part of the unit. This also caused my AC bills to be ridiculous because a majority of the air pressure was coming out the back of the utility closet and not where it was actually needed so it was having to run twice as long as needed. Oh and also the floors and walls are so paper thin you hear not only the neighbor below you, but the person below them as well. Multiple instances in the night where I was hearing music clearly enough through my bedroom floor that I could identify the song, but when I went downstairs to be like ""hey turn it down a tad they were like ""we thought it was you..."" only to go down to the first floor and they were the ones playing music, but not even actually all that loud. I could also clearly understand conversations of the people below me. Their soundproofing is absurdly abysmal."

I'm assuming you're looking to something comparable to dorms so 500-550 a month and I don't think you'll find a 1-bedroom in that area for that price. So you should be looking more into Studios at that price range.   I think Crosswinds on 70th and Leavenworth would be on the low end of the price range, but it smells strongly of Curry every time I go there."

These areas have a lot more transitional spaces than most and are therefore by their nature more dangerous.  The vast majority of crime occurs in a transitional space, that is anywhere that is designed for people to get in and out of quickly.  Walkways, parking lots, stair wells, convenience stores, etc...  This is not a known gang area, or an area that is worked by any known organized criminal elements, but I would not rule out the occasional miscreant trying to give an innocent person a hard time.  If you are used to an urban environment, you should be ok.  Just keep your head on a swivel, have good situational awareness, have a plan if something goes down, don't be a target."

This is a valid reaction to a shirt of this kind, especially when in the confines of bar where having a few drinks and striking up conversation is encouraged. She is obviously not getting the attention in her personal life that she wants so she compensates by causing drama in social situations so that all eyes are on her for a brief period of time.

Omaha,39xmlb,hemlocky_ergot,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"Some humans have a psychological need to feel like they were hit on. Sometimes they follow up the imagined hit-upon by gathering agents of morality,a process which is surprisingly much more easy to do in a bar than in a church for some reason. Honestly, I do believe some people crave to be hit on so that they can vehemently, evenly violently object to having been hit upon.  Slightly unrelated, but Eric Berne (this was 1971) described this game some people play, which might bare some resemblance:   Thesis. This is a game played between a man and a woman which might more politely be called, in the milder forms at least, ‘Kiss Off’ or ‘Indignation.’ It may be played with varying degrees of intensity.   First-Degree ‘Rapo,’ or ‘Kiss Off,’ is popular at social gatherings and consists essentially of mild flirtation. White signals that she is available and gets her pleasure from the man’s pursuit. As soon as he has committed himself, the game is over. If she is polite, she may say quite frankly ‘I appreciate your compliments and thank you very much,’ and move on to the next conquest. If she is less generous, she may simply leave him. A skilful player can make this game last for a long time at a large social gathering by moving around frequently, so that the man has to carry out complicated manoeuvres in order to follow her without being too obvious. In Second-Degree ‘Rapo,’ or ‘Indignation,’ White gets only secondary satisfaction from Black’s advances. Her primary gratification comes from rejecting him, so that this game is also colloquially known as ‘Buzz Off, Buster.’ She leads Black into a much more serious commitment than the mild flirtation of First-Degree ‘Rapo’ and enjoys watching his discomfiture when she repulses him. Black, of course, is not as helpless as he seems, and may have gone to considerable trouble to get himself involved. Usually he is playing some variation of ‘Kick Me.’ Third-Degree ‘Rapo’ is a vicious game which ends in murder, suicide or the courtroom. Here White leads Black into compromising physical contact and then claims that he has made a criminal assault or has done her irreparable damage. In its most cynical form White may actually allow him to complete the sexual act so that she gets that enjoyment before confronting him. The confrontation may be immediate, as in the illegitimate cry of rape, or it may be long delayed, as in suicide or homicide following a prolonged love affair. If she chooses to play it as a criminal assault, she may have no difficulty in finding mercenary or morbidly interested allies, such as the press, the police, counsellors and relatives. Sometimes, however, these outsiders may cynically turn on her, so that she loses the initiative and becomes a tool in their games.   In some cases outsiders perform a different function. They force the game on an unwilling White because they want to play ‘Let’s You and Him Fight.’ They put her in such a position that in order to save her face or her reputation she has to cry rape. This is particularly apt to happen with girls under the legal age of consent; they may be quite willing to continue a liaison, but because it is discovered or made an issue of, they feel constrained to turn the romance into a game of Third-Degree ‘Rapo.’  In one well-known situation, the wary Joseph refused to be inveigled into a game of ‘Rapo,’ whereupon Potiphar’s wife made the classical switch into ‘Let’s You and Him Fight,’ an excellent example of the way a hard player reacts to antithesis, and of the dangers that beset people who refuse to play games. These two games are combined in the well-known ‘Badger Game,’ in which the woman seduces Black and then cries rape, at which point her husband takes charge and abuses Black for purposes of blackmail.  One of the most unfortunate and acute forms of Third-Degree ‘Rapo’ occurs relatively frequently between homosexual strangers, who in a matter of an hour or so may bring the game to a point of homicide. The cynical and criminal variations of this game contribute a large volume to sensational newspaper copy.  The childhood prototype of ‘Rapo’ is the same as that of ‘Frigid Woman,’ in which the little girl induces the boy to humiliate himself or get dirty and then sneers at him, as classically described by Maugham in Of Human Bondage and, as already noted, by Dickens in Great Expectations. This is Second Degree. A harder form, approaching Third Degree, may be played in tough neighbourhoods.  Antithesis. The man’s ability to avoid becoming involved in this game or to keep it under control depends of his capacity to distinguish genuine expressions of feeling from moves in the game. If he is thus able to exert social control, he may obtain a great deal of pleasure from the mild flirtations of ‘Kiss Off.’ On the other hand it is difficult to conceive of a safe antithesis for the Potiphar’s Wife manoeuvre, other than checking out before closing time with no forwarding address. In 1938 this writer met an ageing Joseph in Aleppo who had checked out of Constantinople thirty-two years previously after one of the Sultan’s ladies had cornered him during a business visit to the Yildiz harem. He had to abandon his shop, but took time to pick up his hoard of gold francs, and had never returned.  Relatives. The male versions of ‘Rapo’ are notoriously found in commercial situations: ‘Casting Couch’ (and then she didn’t get the part) and ‘Cuddle Up’ (and then she got fired)."

Omaha,39xi3x,hondaddict,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:34:03 2015 UTC,Know of to many people who have had shit work done at sublime. There prices are crazy high also. However everyone who has had bad luck are non-Honda people. I have used the dyno at the shop out in Lincoln and know of people who have used them for stuff and have had great experiences. The things you want done are easy to DIY and cheaper if you DIY. Buy bolt on exhaust its cheaper then custom + sublime rates at that I would  guess. Unless you can weld yourself bolt on is cheaper in most cases. I will be checking out https://www.facebook.com/HsAutomotiveAndDyno these guys dyno soon based on how they are we will see if they are better people then sublime.    And if you do decide to give sublime business I'm sure they can handle what your asking for.

Check points for contraban are prohibited. The assumption being that they have a law enforcement end.   So, Iowa side or Nebraska side, drive safely and courteously, don't have observable contraband and there should be no stops.   Wait a minute though, if they have observers of vehicles with Nebraska plates in Missouri, that might be probable cause to pull you over and even have you open your trunk."

They wield extra power that normal people do not get, we as a society allow them to hold this power to help defend us. When that power is abused it is hard to prove and when proven they should be held to a much higher standard and be punished to the extreme in my mind. This and other cases like it are giving the justice system a horrid name and the brotherhood of police should come down on them if they want the public to support them. Otherwise we are in a police state and they are our masters rather then they being our servants and protectors. I suppose that is where we are, but not where we should be."

There is a small business called Wogg Works that often brings kayaks out to Standing Bear Lake on Fridays for you to rent. Awesome sunsets.  Rent a bike from the various B-Cycles and check out the bike trails in Omaha. Or borrow some bikes and check out the Wabash trail across the river.  For bar hopping, my favorite areas are Benson, Dundee or the Blackstone District. Get some authentic Mexican Food near 24th St."

Does it compare to the stuff in San Antonio? :) I'm not far from there. They've got some good Mexican food.

I'd tell you to go up north to try and capture the  disproportionate amount of shootings for a city of its size, both by cops and criminals, but luckily you don't even have to drive up north for that now though, just keep your helmet cam on and it could happen any time, anywhere! Just be sure to have your image stabilization turned on as well; the roads are some of the most pot hole riddled I've ever encountered. Watch out for the curbs with exposed rebar on nearly every block! They'll pop your tires in a flash!

Omaha,39aass,largeheartedboy,3,Wed Jun 10 11:30:15 2015 UTC,Feel like the last statement on this article contradicts its title a little bit.  Overall thought it was a good read and I think Conchance is right the hip-hop scene in Omaha isn't really that big so really is the standard that is being set that great? It's hard to know when really only one style is coming out of Omaha.  But maybe with the spotlight gone it can open up for more creativity to be birthed with out the pressure of living up the the sound that came out of here in the early 2000s.

You make significantly more in sales and account management than you ever will turning the wheels in a job market like Omaha. That is why this market is so fucking hot for companies like TekSystems and any other companies that hire temp workers/IT consultants. Because companies only need to hire IT people temporary or to support a business process vs a place like Austin/LA etc where all companies IT is their business.

IF drivers opt out of that class and go to the DMV, that test is frankly... weak.  There are often no lighted turns on the test, no lane changes (left and right) and often, no interstate. All of this adds up to a weak test and puts young drivers at risk because 'they just want to pass the test' when that is not the REAL issue. The real issue is becoming a safe driver.

Lots of drinking/eating establishments, green spaces, and interesting shops to look through.  Midtown Crossing is on the upswing, and contains the Spielbound & Grane places I mentioned above, as well as other eateries and bars.  If you're up for a little traveling, the Chalco Hills & Zorinski areas have nice trails to bike/hike on.  If you're in the mood for sushi, I always recommend my little place Sushi Japan on 144th & Center. Underneath the Old Chicago. It's cheap, but good quality for midwest sushi.  Here's a link to the official tourism page. The links on there are pretty good. I highly recommend checking out live music performances here; they happen constantly and there are some pretty good musicians around here."
Omaha,38xnsc,NE_Irishguy13,2,Mon Jun 8 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"See the Zoo.  It sounds lame, but it's the best in the country.  Please do not go to Lucky Bucket and have that represent the local beer offerings.  Tailgating at the CWS is cool and all, but it's probably like a $10 Uber ride to Benson where there are two breweries and at least four craft beer bars and several music venues.  It's likely cheaper to travel to Blackstone and go to the Crescent Moon for an original ruben, and there are two breweries a couple of blocks from each other, also.  The Old Market is nice and all, but it's a bit more expensive and is a bit more cosmopolitan vs. genuine.  Omaha has both Uber and Lyft.  They are way cheaper and more responsive than the cab service.  However, with that many people in town, they might get oversubscribed."

Omaha,38vj1d,GoesBy,3,Sun Jun 7 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"I had a decent driving record before I joined my current security company.  3 tickets, all going 14 over on a highway (79 on I80, 79 on 680, and 59 on W maple past 180th st). One was taken off on the STAR course so it was counted as two, but my new job required a lot of driving.  Well they needed me to be fast, and yelled at me for being slow. Got another for running a yellow light in Millard (I was going five under, it was really awkward), going 70 down dodge right after it drops to ten to 55, and going 10 over down HW 96 coming back from Valley. Three different agencies, all on the same weekend.  That knocked me up to 12 points. Also, to make matters worse, the DMV never got their money for when I got suspended for reaching 6 points because the court house took it. So the cop took my license too.  Luckily my girlfriend's mom is a lawyer, so a $50 check made out, and a court hearing later, I go to the judge with her for all 3 cases at once, and get them all dropped if I take another STAR class, but I also have to sit at 11 points.  This is all within 3 years, but hopefully the outcome of this story helps answer your question."

Omaha,38vj1d,mendentall,2,Mon Jun 8 15:30:10 2015 UTC,"I would go to the courthouse and take your ticket to the prosecutor's office.  They can refer defendants to take the required class.  If you wait until the actual court date, it will be so crowded and cases moving at such a high rate of speed (like your driving) that the prosecutor most likely won't take a minute or two to have the matter referred.  Maybe they will or maybe they won't during your arraignment but you can for sure get a couple of minutes with one of the prosecutors if you go to their office window instead.  Be polite and respectful and request the class and hopefully it will work out for you."

Omaha,38nup0,enderandrew42,6,Fri Jun 5 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"From what it sounds like, their sentences wouldn't be commuted, but it would also be illegal for a court to issue the death warrant, leaving the inmates in a sort of limbo."
Omaha,38nup0,monocline,6,Fri Jun 5 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. A judge can technically still sentence anyone to death, but the courts still have to issue a 'death warrant' which is what  LB268 has made illegal.

Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,-27,Sun Jun 7 04:31:19 2015 UTC,"The liberal Reddit crowd won't back down either.  Let's remember that the death penalty in Nebraska was abolished only because of the costs, not because they are taking some sort of moral stance against it. But that seems to be what I see here in /r/Omaha - capital punishment is reserved only for the victims of the inmates, not the inmates themselves.  Might I remind everyone that the victims of these death row inmates don't get years of appeals, 3 meals a day and cable TV provided to them. The inmates are able to go outside, read, play basketball. Wouldn't it be nice if the 15 year old victim of Jeffrey Hessler had that ability today? How about the 3 year old victim of Raymond Mata running around in the grass playing...no, he was dismembered and his body parts were thrown in a dog bowl. These criminals were tried by a jury and found guilty, some of them twice. There is no ""rehabilitation"" for these criminals, and regardless of whether they feel remorse after extinguishing the lives' of their victims, they deserve the same leniency they gave to their victims."
Omaha,38nup0,jericko,19,Fri Jun 5 13:06:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who has a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice, and has sat through many hours of class learning about the death penalty, the only reason for it is for revenge.  Its been proven the death penalty does not prevent or detour crime in any way.  It has been proven innocent people have been executed and later proven innocent.  Because the death penalty was a option, people who have served on juries have come forward later and said that even though they knew their accused was guilty, they could not find them guilty knowing it would send them to their death.  The death penalty in Nebraska has not been carried out for almost 20 years.   Yes, there are people in this world that commit actions we can not explain or wrap our head around. But a life sentence in prison removes them from society and life in a maximum penal system is no vacation.  Also, just because someone does not agree with you, does not necessary make them a liberal.  Using that as your opening statement just makes you come off as uneducated."

Omaha,38nup0,jericko,5,Fri Jun 5 14:09:30 2015 UTC,"You need to get out of that mindset everyone is 100% liberal or 100% conservative.  I know some people spend their days/lives watching Fox News or MSNBC and think their party is the savior and the other party stands for evil, but that really is not the case.  I myself lean toward the democrats for health care reform as my son was born with a life threatening heart condition and getting rid of preexisting conditions means he will get the surgeries he needs in life to be able to live.  But my wife and I are both high earners and the democrats keep trying to penalize us for saving (trying to get rid of 529 college accounts is one example).  So when I go vote, I am not blindly casting a vote for a certain party, but the politician that best aligns with what will enrich my life.  I vote both democrat and republican."
Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,-10,Fri Jun 5 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"Way off topic, but I don't think Obamacare is the cure-all for your son. In reality, there are very few who have or would ever be denied healthcare due to a preexisting condition, and I would have preferred to target those special cases with legislation.  As far as thinking blindly with one party or another, many conservatives certainly aren't in love with the Republican party. I don't agree 100% with conservatives, but with this issue, I certainly do. And if that means ""revenge"", and I would consider it ""punishment"" for their crimes and paying the ultimate price for killing innocent children and people who showed up to their job at a bank. I understand the financial argument, and for that I can agree with a vote against, but fiscal restraint isn't the reason why Pete Ricketts is being called a ""dollar store Lex Luthor""."

We hear stories from allot of people before Obama care, were not able to get insurance or if they were, their heart condition was not covered because they were born with it and its considered a preexisting condition.  I know what you read and Obamacare is far from perfect, but it does address allot of flaws in the system.  If the Republicans want to repeal it, then they need to offer a feasible alternative instead of just chanting to get rid of it.  Come sit in a Midwest Heart Condition get together and listen to a Parent cry because their young child died 5 years ago because insurance would not cover their surgery, but now that same surgery is 100% covered thanks to Obamacare and tell me its 100% evil.  I am not asking you to embrace it 100% but just recognize there is some good in it.    I will admit I did have high hopes for Ricketts.  My wife and I are all about personal responsibility when it comes to money and save/invest allot of our income. But Ricketts is not a Republican I can get behind.  I do not care about Gay Marriage, I wont stand in its way, nor will I campaign for it, its a non-issue.  As far as legalizing Pot in NE, or bringing in Casinos I am 100% for it.  I myself and my family would never buy Pot, or set foot in a Casino and waste our hard earned dollars, but many people in NE do, so bring that tax revenue into NE!  I am sick of paying $6000 just in property taxes on my house.  My buddy lives in IA and pays $450 for the same size house.

As far as your son and others that have been affected by this legislation, I have no doubt that the insurance and health care system in this country needs to be fixed. Obama promised that his legislation would reduce costs, and very few if any have seen a reduction in their healthcare costs. The doctor shortage only continues to widen.

Fortunately these were the ones that were released before they were executed.  Death penalties are 15% more likely to be handed out during the judges' election year. The death penalty should coincide with the heinousness of the crime, not as a political maneuver. The cost is more than indefinitely housing the criminal.    Number three is trivial, but until one and two are solved, there is no need for the death penalty. You mentioned the victims of the murderers, but what about the victims of the judicial system?"
Omaha,38nup0,pheaton,16,Fri Jun 5 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"On the other hand.  I consider myself very conservative and here is why I'm against the death penalty.     I'm pro-life.  This doesn't change because the felon is a POS.  Killing a person because they killed someone is almost hypocritical.   People that commit heinous crimes are messed up in the head.  I don't think they consider the potential punishment nor are they in the mindset the fears death.   We didn't really have a death penalty.  We had a death sentence, but we haven't gone through with it for years.  It's effective result is life imprisonment anyways.     The only interesting quandary I have are for those criminals that actually request the death penalty instead of life imprisonment.  Part of me wants to grant that wish, while part of me says no way you get to suffer in prison for ever.    I imagine that if brought to a vote the people will bring the death penalty back, however, I hate pure democracy votes like this, because we are not a democracy, no matter how many people say we are, we aren't.  We elect representatives to make law.  What's the point if we are just going to have people vote on it when we don't get our way?  Dumb.  Rickets is out of line here."

That said, some murder cases are a little more ambiguous.  May want to let the appeals process do its thing in those cases."
Omaha,38nup0,AlexFromOmaha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"You can't really appeal to say ""the jury made a mistake and I'm actually innocent."" That's not how that works."
Omaha,38nup0,BabyBack_Dragon_Ribs,3,Fri Jun 5 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's exactly how the appeal process works.  The jury may not get the whole picture to to poorly presented (or new) evidence.  There are some obvious cases where the party was guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Then there are cases that are a bit more ambiguous.  The ambiguous ones should probably be sentenced differently."
Omaha,38nup0,AlexFromOmaha,2,Fri Jun 5 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"The jury's interpretation is pretty much final when it comes to ""poorly presented"" evidence. You can't present new evidence at an appeal either. You can petition for a re-hearing, but the default answer to that is ""no."" Those are extraordinary.  The best you can do with a jury's interpretation is argue that, even if you concede the prosecution's entire case, interpret all the evidence they presented as favorably as can be reasonably inferred, and basically disregard the defense's entire case, that no crime had been proven. That's a really high bar.  If you have new evidence, you don't get to present it to a judge and argue for your innocence. You should have presented it in trial. You can argue that you couldn't have possibly had the evidence for the trial, like you either didn't know it existed even after due diligence or tried to get more time for it and the judge said no. Even then, you have to argue that the jury would have found differently if the evidence was there.  If you have evidence that absolutely proves your innocence and it was excluded for valid procedural reasons, your conviction stands.  Generally, grounds for appeal are limited to prosecutorial misconduct or procedural violations that were raised during the course of the trial. Even then, you have to argue that the results of the mistake were substantial enough to influence the jury.  Now, give a few lawyers a pile of documents, a case of Scotch, a week to bullshit possibilities, and a month to research precedent, and the above can be stretched pretty far. You still need to be in the ballpark, though."
Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,-4,Sat Jun 6 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"We provide these people every opportunity to appeal, and that's why costs are so high. We sentence people to life in prison in Nebraska, so the death penalty is reserved for the worst of the worst. I don't have a problem with the justice system taking the time needed to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that these people are guilty using the latest in technological advances to prove the case. The problem is the cost associated with unlimited appeals."

Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,0,Fri Jun 5 17:59:54 2015 UTC,I did answer the question.
Omaha,38nup0,mharriger,4,Sat Jun 6 04:46:21 2015 UTC,"My opinion on capital punishment, which is a little different than what I've seen expressed anywhere, is that even if one accepts that the state in some instances (i.e. extremely heinous crimes) is morally justified in executing people, it is not possible to build a human system that can prove beyond any doubt in every case that a particular person committed a crime. A system that can prove that in most cases is not good enough, the system must be provably foolproof before it's good enough to use for handing out an irrevocable punishment like the death penalty. And as humans, we just can't build that.  I know that people will bring up specific cases and say ""well, in this case we KNOW he did it"", but to me that's not good enough, because I can bring up another case where we're pretty sure but we don't really know, and the system has to be able to infallibly differentiate between those two. And no, I won't accept either confessions or eyewitness evidence as ""good enough"", because there are known cases where both of those things have later been shown to be wrong. DNA evidence is also not good enough, the FBI crime lab just recently admitted to errors that caused them to report inaccurate confidence levels for DNA matches. (edit: also, close to home, there's the Matthew Livers and Nicholas Sampson case in which the DNA evidence was found to be planted. Can you guarantee that you will always catch planted evidence or other malfeasance?)  The only situation I can think of in which the evidence might be good enough is the person being arrested in the act, and the arrest caught on video. And that seems so unlikely that it hardly seems worth having a death penalty for that circumstance.  I'm open to suggestion of systems that might meet this burden of proof, or anything that would help refine this view. Remember that it must work for all conceivable cases though, unless you're willing to admit to being OK with possibly executing innocent people."
Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,-7,Sat Jun 6 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"it is not possible to build a human system that can prove beyond any doubt in every case that a particular person committed a crime.

And as humans, we just can't build that.   There is no system that is fool-proof. I think we can both agree to that. We have a justice system that eliminates convicting innocent people better than most if not every justice system in the world. If you ask for 100% certainty in our court system, then you're asking for a level of proof we cannot meet, and therefore, we could never convict anyone of any crime regardless of the sentence (capital or otherwise)."
Omaha,38nup0,Switz51,4,Fri Jun 5 15:03:08 2015 UTC,So you're okay with the state killing people as long as most of them are guilty?
Omaha,38nup0,Oldschool1964,-5,Fri Jun 5 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with the state executing people that have been convicted of a crime in accordance with the level of proof stipulated by our justice system. If you believe that level of proof is too low, then I believe the level of proof /u/mharriger demands cannot be met, and therefore, we would have criminals who should be in maximum security prisons and/or executed roaming free on the streets because of a flaw in the system.   I also think people who once believed in the US justice system would more often take matters in their own hands, and because of the level of proof needed under a system with an unnecessarily high level of proof required, they would be very comfortable with the chances they have in avoiding conviction for vigilante justice."
Omaha,38nup0,Switz51,4,Fri Jun 5 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"So that is that a yes? As multiple states have convicted people of a crime and then executed them only to find out that these people were completely innocent.  I agree that /u/mharriger demands cant be met.

I would say half of North Omaha live in worse conditions.   Hell, my time in boot camp was more punishment than what these guys live with day in and day out.

I think it's kind of shallow of you to base your opinion of someone on whether they have traveled outside the country.   You seem to take a very black and white position in your arguments. Your mind seems to already be set and there is no changing that. I guess you have the world figured out, eh?   No, but I've experienced enough in my life to have formed opinions. I've changed my views (politically and otherwise) in the past, so I don't have the world figured out. I'm just giving my opinion, just like you. My opinions on here are unpopular though (based on the downvotes I've inherited today). I don't follow the hive mind and I try to think for myself on these matters. It would be way too easy to just say ""Pete Ricketts is a moron, a liar, a dollar store Lex Luthor"" and win the internetz like the rest of /r/Omaha, but I've stayed for the backlash."
Omaha,38nup0,baleia_azul,0,Fri Jun 5 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"They are just imaginary internet points that you can't redeem anyways.   As someone who also doesn't follow the Reddit hive mind, I can respect that.   I do however feel that traveling abroad is beneficial in opening a person's mind and helping then grow. Seeing examples of a process implemented by another culture (that we would never dream of doing), and seeing it be successful should make a person wonder if it's possible here.  Instead I tend to see too much anger and hatred from both sides. When emotions are involved, I feel like the debates are done."
Omaha,38nup0,Hard58Core,2,Fri Jun 5 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"You're projecting inaccurate assumptions on the ""liberal"" reddit crowd.  I am not against the death penalty because of a moral stance against hurting people.  I would love to see some of these criminals murdered in the worst possible way.  I am against the death penalty because it is a costly process (WAY more expensive than holding a prisoner for life), and because I don't want the government to have that kind of power."

By now, everyone should know whether they are for or against capital punishment.  All the stats and reasoning has been laid out over and over.  I don't think anything you say to ""liberal reddit"" will change their stance and, I'm sure, vice versa.  The discussion here seems to be whether Lex has a legal leg to stand on.  Your billboard material seems top notch though, and probably should have been presented to those who voted against it a few weeks ago."

Omaha,38pqgr,designerdad,2,Sat Jun 6 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"I volunteered and attended last night.  The weather was perfect once the sun went down.  This Fest is a lot less intimate than Benson's & GNBF, which I think detracts from the experience.  It feels like you don't get to meet people because there's so much space- for me, part of the fun at crowded festivals is literally, though accidentally, running into people, which forces me to say something-- whether it be ""sorry!"" or ""hey, I like your shirt!""   You meet people- you may never know their names, but they become your beer friends and you smile and raise your tiny glass to them all day long."

Omaha,38q4ed,DickJuggle,3,Sat Jun 6 08:00:06 2015 UTC,"It's a worldwide territory battle between two factions. It's a GPS based games that use landmarks, statues, and a few other things as portals. Your team captures them and tries to hold it as long as possible. You can link portals together to make them stronger and add shields and weapons to them.  You cannot see the other players on the map, so you have to assume who is playing. If your teams colors pop up around you, you can team up to destroy that area or reinforce it.   I just got done for the night (3:30am). Met a few nice people from both factions, blew stuff up, and built stuff. Everyone I've come across has been very excited to help new players.   If you have empty time spaces and want to get out and see things or meet new people, this is a very effective tool."

It seems to get bigger each year, different artists come each time, and now I get to bring my daughter to it. I'll go next year and I'm sure I'll keep going for years afterward. I have no problems with that. And when I have more free time I'll go see other things too.   Regardless, saying there's no ""functional entertainment"" is patently false.

Just as much as you have a right to have your opinion heard because you disagree with reinstating it doesn't mean you should get to block out those who do agree with it. If you're against it, fine, don't sign. But deliberately blocking others is corrupt and unjust. You want politicians to be clean and honest, how about you do the same? Everyone has a right to be heard, and you shouldn't purposely try to mute people's voices."

Omaha,38tevi,Broking37,-1,Sat Jun 6 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't say stop people from signing, I said prevent the paid circulators from asking for signatures by occupying their attention. If someone really wants to sign they'll still be able to.   And besides, your argument could just as easily apply to someone who simply chooses not to sign. By not signing, one is preventing the referendum and thereby preventing the voters of Nebraska from having their voices heard."
Omaha,38tevi,SharpKeyCard,2,Sat Jun 6 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"Your argument is to directly block petition circulators from being signatures.    act as if you are on the fence and take up the time of the circulators, time that would otherwise be spent gathering signatures!    The difference between choosing to sign vs not is a choice YOU make, but someone blocking others from voting isn't a choice YOUR making. It's someone else deciding that you shouldn't have a chance to vote. Your argument makes no sense, your idea is about blocking votes, choosing not to vote is a choice. So I don't get how your hypothetical situation makes any sense.  Edit: fix quote formatting"
Omaha,38tevi,SharpKeyCard,-2,Sat Jun 6 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe it doesn't make sense because you're stuck on your imagined scenario of how this would transpire and it doesn't have anything to do with what I described. Engaging a petition circulator in conversation is nothing close to what you're describing, which would be closer to standing in front of them not allowing someone to get close enough to sign. It comes down to the circulator's choice - do I spend my time trying to convince one person, or do I try and ask as many people as possible? At some point they'll either see through the act or give up, but nowhere did I say anything about forcefully holding their attention.   You assumed a scenario that had little to do with what I described. I didn't paint a picture for you but it didn't seem necessary."

Omaha,38tevi,riverfan,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of... well, misinformation and hasty generalizations in your first paragraphs but those aside, I agree it's okay to engage one, but engaging one for the soul purpose to obstruct their work isn't okay. I also agree that it isn't a snap decision, but what is being advocated here is pretending that you haven't decided when you in fact already have and you're single intention is to obstruct what should be a fair process by being dishonest.   Something to point out, police officers have a respect for human beings. They leave their families to protect yours, careful with those hasty generalization.  Ad campaigns that Ricketts might run can not be funded with tax payer money, it's his money to do as he pleases. Only public service, non-agenda based, ads may be ran with public funding."
Omaha,38tevi,riverfan,2,Sun Jun 7 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"What you are advocating may in fact be illegal.  Obstructing public thoroughfares, obstructing the lawful work of a petition circulator.  You also create an image that people who oppose the petition are whackjobs.  People then choose between the law abiding petition circulator or the dicks blocking him/her."
Omaha,38tevi,TheDaveWSC,0,Sat Jun 6 22:10:23 2015 UTC,You've somehow made the same mistake as /u/SharpKeyCard.   You assumed a scenario that had little to do with what I described. I didn't paint a picture for you but it didn't seem necessary.   Engaging someone in conversation does not require obstructing a public thoroughfare or a circulator - it is his or her choice to give attention where they see fit. What is wrong with you two?

Omaha,38o35i,StoutFan,5,Fri Jun 5 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've typically seen 5-7% on most NE realty companies, specifically if you go with a larger firm. I know my friends who are Realtors with NP Dodge are at or around 6%.  You may get an extra 1-2% for doing both homes, but I don't think the change would be that significant. If you need a few names or a realtor to ask specifically, feel free to message me and I can give you a handful of people I know personally."
Omaha,38o35i,zXster,3,Fri Jun 5 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"DISCLOSURE: I'm a realtor.    Depends on the agent, depends on the company.  The larger shops like NP and CBS tend to afford less flexibility to their agents.  From what I've seen on final closing statements, their agents rarely list much below 6%.  Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's pretty unusual.  Same goes for Berkshire (FKA Prudential).  Everyone else is all over the place, frankly.  I'm in a smaller shop, and my broker basically lets me write my own business - within reasonable limits, he doesn't really care what I charge.    I'm already quite competitive, but on a double-ended arrangement it gets pretty cheap on the listing side.  Like, well below 5% (can't get too specific for a variety of reasons).

Omaha,38o35i,wildjokers,0,Fri Jun 5 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is not to use a realtor at all. They are a complete waste of money. The Internet has made the entire realtor profession worthless. The only reason they still exist is because they ensure people that they still need to exist. They really beg the question with that one.  Just sell your house by owner (FSBO -- For Sale By Owner). As far as buying a house you can search listings as well as a realtor, although since the seller pays the realtor it doesn't really matter to you from a buying point of view except that you will support the myth that realtors are still relevant.  A real estate attorney will handle your sale for probably around $500, which is way less than a real estate commission on a 300K sale. The attorney may include writing up a buying contract as part of that, just have to ask.  Just go to: http://www.forsalebyowner.com (you can pay to have your house listed in the MLS if you really want to, but you are going to have to offer a commission if a realtor brings a buyer to you)."

Omaha,38o35i,davetherealtor,2,Fri Jun 5 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"I will respond to this to help you explain. First off, I am an agent as my name states, and yes we should disclose that as the above realtor did.  I work for NP Dodge here in Omaha but I work for a builder as well.  I am around new construction daily.  Also, FSBO = for sale by owner for reference.  All you have to do is look up the stats.  Over 90% of for sale by owner homes do not sell.  Plain and simple.  Yes, you certainly have a much greater advantage with the internet sites like for sale by owner and even Zillow allows you to post.  The problem is that you still do not get the exposure.  You still get to pay for a lot of their options as well.  Is it a terrible idea to try?  Not at all.  I bet you that most of the calls you get if you do go FSBO are from realtors to help you sell your home.  Many work this angle as a large portion of their business and are successful.  The benefits of a realtor are why people still use them.  I will give a few examples, but there are many.  We mainly work in this area, so we have tons of helpful advice to setup your home to be ready to sell.  We have connections to all sorts of people we work with day in and day out who can repair anything that needs it.  We either know how to take professional photos or someone who can.  This doesn't cost extra and makes a large difference. ( Ever see a photo of a bathroom with a toilet seat up?  Big no no. ) Two of the largest benefits are negotiation and valuation. We are there to get you the best price possible when it comes to selling your home. We also are there to help you sell it fast.  One of the greatest mistakes for people going FSBO is that they have no idea how to value their home.  There is tons of info out there, but how do you know which site to trust.  We use the MLS just like the appraisers will do so that there are no problems down the line. Truly, the benefits are huge.    As far as the main question on this post, I personally would do 6% on both.  We, as a builder team, do not give discounts on comission if you buy and sell with us.  We may give you some money off on the new construction price although.  I will explain why. Yes, you can get plenty of realtors in Omaha to drop their rate by just pressing them. That is fine, but what you are essentially doing is telling someone to get paid less for doing the same amount of work.  If you worked at a fast food chain for $9/hr and I came up to you and said, ""I am going to start paying you $7/hr"" would you keep working there?  That is exactly what lowering our commission does.  On the flip side, I have to show you my value, or it is a no brainer to go to another realtor.  Guess what, I still have business and my clients are more than happy to pay 6% because of what I offer to them.  It is up to you how you want to work it.    I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck with your new home!"

Try using the map on http://www.apartments.com/ to see what you can find at you price.  Avoid anything in north, especially northeast Omaha.  South Omaha is spotty, but it's got great Mexican restaurants.  I'd say try to stay between Center and Maple, but it gets better the further west you go.  Maybe consider finding a roommate or someone looking for a roomate."

Omaha,38mabc,USMC0317,3,Fri Jun 5 03:21:36 2015 UTC,Didn't your house come with a 3 month service one warranty?  That's pretty standard.  Just call them and make them fix it.
Omaha,38mabc,zoug,2,Fri Jun 5 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"Did you switch the thing near the furnace from winter to summer?  Also is the fan on the furnace running?  That's what moves the air through the house.    You could also have a clogged air filter, which is also on the furnace.    This is the extent of my knowledge."
Omaha,38mabc,TheoreticalFunk,2,Fri Jun 5 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"You should have a home owners warranty of some sort. Also call your inspection company, they should've caught that.  If you for some crazy reason don't we like Brasch HVAC, they were really honest and fair price wise."
Omaha,38mabc,rc1965,2,Fri Jun 5 12:24:49 2015 UTC,Try putting in a fresh air filter first of all. Check the floor registers are actually open. Put the thermostat to fan only and check its blowing air out. Check on the ductwork around the furnace for dampers. Check for error numbers or lights flashing which you can google. Some units have variable speed fans and auto dampers so might act weird in terms of air blowing. Set the temp low and leave it alone for a bit and see what happens.
Omaha,38mabc,dataflux,2,Fri Jun 5 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"Go out to your ac and make sure the disconnect (the box next to the unit) is in the ""on"" position. If it's not, pull out the handle, flip it over, and reinsert it.  You'd be amazed how often I run across this."

Omaha,38iroh,tophrman,3,Thu Jun 4 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at MVNOs also look at Straight Talk if you're a data heavy user.

It's $45/mo for unlimited talk and text with 3gb of LTE then throttling, and 5gb of LTE if you BYOD."
Omaha,38iroh,MrGulio,2,Thu Jun 4 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"I have had it for about 4 months, and I haven't had any issues with it.  Service is no better or worse than when I was with Verizon, but costs me about $60/less a month.     I don't use much voice, the 1000 texts suits me fine, and I try to use wifi as much as possible for data.  I do most of my living/entertaining in Midtown/Benson, and haven't had any service problems, but, apparently, there is some wonky Sprint-less spots out west that I've yet to experience."
Omaha,38iroh,bogartbrown,2,Thu Jun 4 14:26:39 2015 UTC,Ting uses Sprint towers. The only issues I've ever had are south of Bellevue. I go to Glenwood occasionally and I have zero service south of Offutt.    I've had Ting for about a year and have been happy with it. We've saves a boat-load of money and don't feel like we've had to compromise for it.
Omaha,38iroh,ashleyraptor,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:32:02 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I live right by Offutt. Thanks for the info!
Omaha,38iroh,bobapple,2,Thu Jun 4 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"I've had it for just under a year. Very pleased. I was on Sprint before, so the service is the same. On Sprint I was paying $200+ a month for 3 phone lines, with Ting it is usually under $80 a month."
Omaha,38iroh,garbonzo,2,Thu Jun 4 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have Ting, but I looked at it. The lack of data roaming concerned me. On Sprint I've been in some areas of town where I end up roaming.  Republic Wireless gives you 25mb of data roaming a month. Not much, but enough to keep you going if you fall out of a coverage spot."

Omaha,38iroh,Whazzits,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"I do. It works fairly well for me, but I'm pretty lenient for service terms. In general, if I want to get to a page on the internet, I can get there 90 percent of the time. The biggest issue is if/when I try to use the Wells Fargo app; it automatically boots you if you have a subpar connection.  As for call quality, it's pretty good, no complaints, but to be fair I rarely actually call anyone.   Overall it's a pretty great service, especially if you're low on cash, and are willing to put up with minor service gaps. 8/10 ask me for a referral link."
Omaha,38iroh,Broking37,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:47:38 2015 UTC,"It's a hassel getting phones for Ting now, since Sprint codes just about every phone as having a balance due. I tried 4 different phones and they were all coking back as unable to activate."
Omaha,38iroh,Mightykorf,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:21:57 2015 UTC,"We love Ting. We are not power users of our phones by any means, but we never have issues with speed, or coverage, and it costs us like $50-$65/mo.  If you want, Ting actually sent me a referral link today that lasts through Monday night, it will get you $100 off of a phone or as a credit to your account. I can post it if you'd like."
Omaha,38iroh,22cthulu,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"I've had Ting since last October, the service is great. My bill tends to be around $25 a month. In January I must have thought I was on Wifi, and streamed Netflix for a few hours racking up a few gb of data, and my bill ended up being $49, I didn't remember using so much data so I called ting and talked to a rep to figure out what happened. The Rep was great, and ended up giving me a $15 credit towards Februarys bill.   My only problem with Ting service so far is that when I'm going south on 120th from Dodge towards Center, my calls always drop. It doesn't happen when I'm going north on 120th, but that's a fairly minor problem for me as I rarely talk on my phone whilst driving."

Omaha,38jfnn,workthrowaway68,9,Thu Jun 4 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like the public transportation in Omaha is definitely not the greatest but it does exist! From Western Omaha I think it would be very difficult to find some sort of busing or public transportation to get to the Aksarben area. I think most public transportation stops around the Westroads Mall area (102nd-ish) but I could be wrong.    West Omaha is a nice place to live and a good area for raising a family but there are also good area around the Aksarben area as well. I do feel, however, that West Omaha is kind of far away from most things to do in Omaha.    If public transportation is going to be your way of commuting to work I may look into carpooling or possibly looking at living more East."
Omaha,38jfnn,silkie_blondo,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:07:22 2015 UTC,http://www.ometro.com/ has all the schedules for the buses. But silkie pretty much said it about the transportation. The 98 and 15 are the only buses that goes out far West and that goes to Village Pointe and Lakeside (168th-ish). The 15 goes on Center (Bergan mercy is very close to Center) so if you don't have that much North / South travel to Center you should be good. We do have Lyft/Uber though if you're willing to take that.
Omaha,38jfnn,buttanugz,4,Sun Jun 7 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"The public transportation pretty much sucks here.  That being said, if you live on West Center Rd, there is a bus route that takes you straight to Mercy Hospital  and Aksarben Village.  I believe the buses come every thirty minutes or so (depending on the time of the day), and it's a bout a 40 minute ride.  I did it for a summer to try to save money and be green, but it got annoying because they're not very reliable at showing up at the right time.  As far as school districts go, Elkhorn is probably tops these days, but it's WAY out west.  Millard, Westside, and Papillion - La Vista are good as well.  Omaha Public Schools (OPS) is pretty hit-or-miss."
Omaha,38jfnn,TheoreticalFunk,3,Thu Jun 4 17:48:34 2015 UTC,Ah Milwaukee.  Nice town.  Don't depend on the bus system here.  It's impossible to figure out and the busses will arrive early a lot of times.  You can use Google maps to plan routes on public transit here... but as I said make sure you show up early.

Wonder if they have loft style homes in that area to get in early on...."
Omaha,38jfnn,Powellwx,2,Thu Jun 4 21:12:44 2015 UTC,Old Market is pretty much as good as it is going to get as I think it's at near critical mass per capita to be able to support itself.  edit: Also the Old Market has been around quite a long time... there's nothing there to get in early on.
Omaha,38jfnn,Mightykorf,2,Thu Jun 4 21:21:53 2015 UTC,"I moved from Chicago (20 years) to Omaha (10 years) to Green Bay (12 years now). Omaha is a clean Milwaukee with more money on average. Love the city, tons to do, great food, lots of nice events and trails. Nice lakes especially west Omaha. Public transportation is not the best. Summers are very hot. If I had the opportunity, I would move back. Loved my time there. I would want my kids in Millard or Elkhorn schools. Downtown is great, the new areas around UNO are nice also, but I would want to live west with kids."
Omaha,38jfnn,supermyduper,2,Thu Jun 4 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"Omaha is really more of a car town, especially out west. The public transit is there, but not super well traveled, or funded. Driving here is pretty easy though. We don't have much of a rush hour, our streets are (mostly) a nice even grid, and even at the worst times of day you're looking at (most) a ~30 minute drive to get absolutely anywhere.  Living out west is a pretty safe bet, (I'm thinking, 108th and higher) most neighborhoods will be your standard built in the 70's and up sort of suburban neighborhoods. For the rest of town it can really very block by block. Maybe post again, or PM me or someone else if you're considering a specific neighborhood. There are some really amazing quiet, older neighborhoods around Omaha."

Omaha,38jfnn,Krakenzmama,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"The number 15 bus goes east to west on Center.  That will go right to your office.  Otherwise buses are not reliable west of 90th and are somewhat better, but not great east of 90th."
Omaha,38jfnn,OneMagicalSpitball,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:12:15 2015 UTC,"I am a regular bus rider but the Bus that goes from West O (Oakview mall) to Bergan Mercy has to be the 15. You can do a park n ride - drive to Oakview, park and then take the bus. But as the others say, you may find a car is more convenient and you may be walking a long distance from where you live. Omaha public transpo is a poor choice compared to cities like Portland :( The times are limited during the weekend so it can be a PITA if you have a late shift.  If you are fit and can handle the challenge, the buses have bicycle racks. Bike riding comes with a caveat: hills. Nebraska has a rep for being flat but that's crap. So many omaha neighborhoods here have names with ""hills"" in them and they are not misnomers. Your legs may end up pretty hulked out if you don't die first."
Omaha,38jfnn,stockbreaker,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:38:02 2015 UTC,"I would suggest looking at the suburbs if you're raising a family. Papillion, Bellevue, and Ralston are just a few of the closest ones."
Omaha,38jfnn,Krakenzmama,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:45:32 2015 UTC,"As an alternative perspective to some of the other posters, I would advocate for Benson/Dundee/Elmwood. If you don't have kids YET, it would be a fun part of town to rent in, especially if you and your wife like to go out to eat/drink/see shows/etc. More urban but still good parks, more accessible public transport, and more access to downtown if that's where you'll be working.  Also many of my friends who grew up in Omaha are living in this part of town and raising kids. I am a Central HS grad and I would argue that the education there rivals any in the city. It's one of the oldest public high schools west of the Mississippi, with a long tradition of academics, sports and college prep.   That being said, I understand the appeal of suburbia for some families. Not saying they're wrong, but I make more money than a lot of the Millard grads I know ;)"
Omaha,38jfnn,Dtrain323i,2,Fri Jun 5 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"Just to add, if you live in Benson, try to stay south of Maple and north of 48th, although gentrification is moving towards NW Radial. Houses get older but well cared for as you get closer to UNMC. Dundee is pretty nice all around and Elmwood has amazing older houses and is near UNO. East O is spottier but there are plenty of nice places."

I tweaked it in the shower one time with my arm and the pain was excruciating.  Once it heals, there is no problem.  I was going to get a Prince Albert myself, but I read on wikipedia that some experience a pee dribble that is uncontrollable.  It's most likely a rare side effect, but I didn't want to take the chance so I got my nipple pierced instead."

Check out meetup.com or techomaha.org. we also have a developer happy hour in the spring and a holiday party in December.

Can't help but plug AIM's CoderDojo and Girls in IT programs, working with kids who are interested in coding and tech projects. They're really upping their game and involving their volunteers in their ""what else can we do?/what can we do next?"" conversations. Here's the link for the CoderDojo site. I think the next season comes next fall. I'm not actually sure where the info for the Girls in IT program is, but if you PM me I can give you the info for one of the women organizing it.

Omaha,382a3z,Parade0fChaos,18,Mon Jun 1 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"I feel it more broadly reflects on the abject lack of knowledge on voters' parts. Pete's daddy has the kind of money to put that bald fuck's face everywhere within three states, and flies him around everywhere for exposure. Democratic candidates far and wide do NOT have that kind of financial backing, and cannot get the word out on their policies and ideas at the same level.

Omaha,382a3z,capedja,5,Mon Jun 1 16:43:14 2015 UTC,"Also, year's of the state Democratic Party being Ben Nelson's personal machine combined with a Unicameral that has no party identification means that we have zero farm team for solid candidates."
Omaha,382a3z,thephfactor,13,Mon Jun 1 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"lack of party identification in the unicameral is a very positive thing though, and is probably the only reason such a conservative state managed to repeal the death penalty anyway."
Omaha,382a3z,1000facedhero,0,Mon Jun 1 21:45:34 2015 UTC,"I would say there is a solid farm for candidates in the unicameral, Nordquist, Mello and even guys like Lathrop were all better than Hasselbrook.  The bigger issue is that nobody wants to spend the time and effort on losing a statewide race.  The congressional seat is much more appealing and to a certain extent also the mayors office as both are winnable seats with real power.  When incompetent hacks like Charlie Janssen can get elected in statewide races just because of the R next to their name why waste time money and political capital if you can win a real seat."
Omaha,382a3z,capedja,3,Tue Jun 2 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"It isn't really a farm system if all the left leaning candidates are coming from Lincoln and Omaha. For anyone to be elected to statewide office you need to at least have a presence in Norfolk, Scottsbluff, and the rest of the state. Not having partisan elections removes the need for a party infrastructure to even go through the motions in those areas. Without it, even a center-right Dem for statewide office won't be able to get a solid ground game going statewide."

Omaha,382a3z,Suraru,5,Tue Jun 2 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"I just love how John Oliver rips Pete Ricketts a new one.  My personal opinion because everyone cares? I get the whole reason why you'd want to remove capital punishment (death row inmates being posthumously cleared of their crimes due to newly found evidence is actually pretty common), but removing the tool to rid the world of someone who was caught red handed or with undeniable evidence, only leaves the chance they'll escape from prison and do it again.  Instead of removing the only for sure way to remove a proven serial killer from the world, how about tighten the parameters for it? Innocent people being executed wouldn't happen if being executed wasn't something you can slap on someone who ""most likely"" committed a horrible crime, it should be slapped on someone ""definitely"" did it."
Omaha,382a3z,diastataxic,15,Mon Jun 1 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"only leaves the chance they'll escape from prison and do it again.   Considering that it can take decades for a death penalty case to wind its way through the appeals process, and that we currently have eleven people sitting on death row in NE and haven't managed to execute any of them since 1997, I'd say this isn't a pressing concern. If it were, we'd be executing people ASAP.   Your ""anti"" argument (that we shouldn't execute people because we might accidentally kill an innocent person) is a popular one, but it's not the only one. Personally, I don't think the government has any business killing people as a punishment, period.  Again, this is just personal opinion, and I'm not trying to change yours at all, just letting you know that us ""no-nay-never"" death penalty opponents are out there, too."
Omaha,382a3z,Suraru,3,Mon Jun 1 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for understanding, it's nice to see people on the internet who state facts with the intention of educating instead of changing opinions because they conflict with their own. My friend on Facebook had a similar reply to yours, and I sent him this, which is relevant to the conversation.   Well it is legal to kill, you just have to do it legally. Like self defense, or defending a life, or home invasion in Texas.   Killing someone for justice is to ultimately prevent someone from doing it again. Usually someone that dangerous can't be taught right from wrong due to a mental illness or something. It's also why capital punishment has to be humane, without suffering.  At least that's how it should be, some people are just blood thirsty, especially in Texas."

Now, to say off the bat, that is not the same as me saying I do not understand why you would troll, because all manner of shallow, sad folk have their own personal reasons for trolling. I am saying, I do not understand the point you are trying to make if anyone with brain activity follows your statement to its logical conclusion.  Which is to say, are you saying calling out a fuckwit is circlejerking, or are you saying calling out a Republican fuckwit is circlejerking? I mean, as far as I understand reddit, a fuckwit is a fuckwit, unless you're so far liberal Ellen Pao looks like goddamn Reagan, and any fuckwit is open to ridicule.  Ricketts is a tool. There is no shame (or lie) in saying this. The only real shame is how his kids (who he gleefully prostituted during his campaign) will inevitably end up. What he ignorantly does to this state is inconsequential opposed to what socially inept and out of touch crotchfruit he and his ""dutiful"" wife will unleash upon us.  Won't you think of the children?"
Omaha,382a3z,peesteam,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"Big surprise, yet another redditor who doesn't think reddit leans left.  Everyone in here is saying ricketts is an idiot, a fuckwit, a tool, whatever, but nobody is backing up these statements. How did you come to this conclusion? Oh, he's a republican, therefore he doesn't hold liberal values, therefore he's an idiot and a tool? Astute analysis there.  I mean, I don't even vote anymore because everything pisses me off, but when I see people so vehemently against somebody, I'd at least expect to see a few reasons to justify why. But I don't, and I never do. So I stand by my elementary assumption that we all should hate him because he's rich and has an R next to his name."

Omaha,381bes,mouseyjoey,2,Mon Jun 1 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"Nope, still terrible in the South, just all year long."
Omaha,381bes,swordofBarsoom,5,Mon Jun 1 13:15:17 2015 UTC,"It's my impression that places with cold winters and hot summers have worse roads. Water creeps into the concrete, expands, causes cracks and pot holes... Then it warms up and all that is exposed.  Went to Florida last Spring, did not see one traffic cone on those smooth roads, and made me all the more annoyed to drive around Omaha when I came home."
Omaha,381bes,turtlehana,2,Mon Jun 1 04:17:45 2015 UTC,Not in my area
Omaha,381bes,Starsintosun,2,Mon Jun 1 04:19:34 2015 UTC,Mostly in the South due to less weather fluctuation.   Avoid the Northeast like the plague.  Edit:a word.
Omaha,381bes,mjconns,2,Mon Jun 1 11:28:42 2015 UTC,"Cities with better year-round weather. Any city that gets below freezing will have roads commonly crack/need repair. Add in snow and snow-plow trucks digging up the road (it's the side effect of clearing the snow) and you'll only add to the brutality the roads endure and, thus, need repairs from -- which can then only be completed during better weather months, resulting in a lot of sudden roadwork in March/April that extend through the summer."
Omaha,381bes,SoBFiggis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"turtlehana was correct (I also lived in Kansas moved to Omaha and it was the same.) This last year I lived in Northern Michigan, in the winter there was obviously no construction but the roads break up very quickly in that kind of weather, so once spring even has a hunt of showing the road crews are out fixing all the new potholes before tourist season starts.  It's pretty much the same everywhere. Road work needs to be done constantly to keep things safe."
Omaha,381bes,TheoreticalFunk,3,Tue Jun 2 15:15:31 2015 UTC,It's normal if you live in the north where it typically gets below zero in the winter.
Omaha,381bes,teabase,2,Mon Jun 1 15:27:05 2015 UTC,Once the weather is nice more construction occurs because it is easier than working in the winter.  Welcome to jackhammer season!

Omaha,38155f,zieski,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:26:12 2015 UTC,Omaha is a mid size city very similar in size to Tucson. It will have roughly the same amount of stuff to do.  What stuff do you like to do in Tucson?
Omaha,38155f,mharriger,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"In Tucson, other than the usual bowling, movie theaters, swap meets, bars etc. all there really to do is to go hiking, camping, and the normal outdoors stuff (plus 120 degree weather for like 2–3 months out of the year) and that's not really my thing. I do it every now and then, but I'm more of a city-dweller.  The potential I see with Omaha is that, not only is it a more lively town than Tucson, but it's also reasonable driving distance from all sorts of cool stuff. Theme parks like Worlds of Fun, Six Flags down near St. Louis, Silver Dollar City in Branson, MO. I could go visit Chicago, where my job field is actually booming (so I could visit and see the work going on, etc).  The difference with Tucson, is that everything fun is 8+ hours away. San Diego, LA, Las Vegas, Colorado, etc. Tucson in general is just an old folks' town. All of the 'snow birds' (older people) come down from colder climates and move here, so a lot of stuff is geared towards the older crowd."
Omaha,38155f,TheDaveWSC,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:35:01 2015 UTC,"There is (probably) less to do as far as outdoors stuff in Omaha, most of this part of the country is farmland, so there are fewer places to hike, camp, etc. There are state parks, but it's nothing like what there is in the western states. That said, since you're not that into it anyway, you probably won't care much."

Bigger places have too many people (which comes with traffic and hour-long waits to restaurants, etc), and smaller places come with nothing to do. Your choice I guess.

There are hiking and biking trails nearby.  Not mountains, but nice hills.  The Loess Hills.  Camping there too in spots.   There are small orchards and small wineries to visit.    Ethnic festivals of one sort or another in many of the small towns in the surrounding area.  Okoboji isn't the wild blast it used to be, but still decent for a long weekend get-away.  You can take design inspiration from nature at Fontenelle Forest or Neale Woods.  Or the Sand Hills.  Watch the SandHill crane migration out west near Grand Island.  Watch the eagles at Desoto Bend.   There's that sunken ship thing by DeSoto Bend too."

If you want entertainment besides bowling, then try Sempecks.  If you want cheap, go to westlanes on sunday right when they open for unlimited bowling for $10.  If you wanted to do league bowling then maplewood lanes has the most league options.  Personally I go to the Thunderbowl. Not nearly as busy (at least when I go which is when they open). They maintain their lanes, have decent food and friendly staff.  Maplewood lanes also has decent drinks if you're into drinking while you bowl.  I try to stay away from westlanes mostly because it's a bit dirtier. My balls always come back from the ball return with black gunk on them after only 10 frames.  Leopard lanes is alright also but severely outdated on their equipment."

You could consider Des Moines if you're just looking to get to a different similar-sized city, otherwise you're looking at smaller destinations.  Edit: smaller destinations are okay too, but they're much more dependent on what you're interested in. Like floating down the Niobrara. Another might be going to Lincoln for a weekend, have dinner in the Haymarket or something, visit Morrill Hall, see some other stuff (the SAC Museum is on the way), etc. This could also be a day trip since Lincoln is so close."

The bigger cities like Chicago,  Denver, Minneapolis,  or St. Louis you definitely need to make it more than a weekend. Wisconsin dells is the water park capitol of the world. Add two days for driving. Kansas city is fun for adults and kids. Great night life like Power and lights or fun for kids with Worlds and Oceans of fun. Des Moines is alright if you have kids and want to go to adventureland. Not much more to do there. The Niobrara river is fun but I don't recommend bringing kids although people do.  It can get pretty wild. Nebraska city is a nice little town for a weekend especially in the fall. Sioux city opened a hard rock casino and hotel which has concerts about every weekend. Go camping.

Omaha,37mana,Sean951,2,Fri May 29 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"The accounting to determine how much to put into these funds is based on the cost of road maintenance.  When you start adding things, you by force raise the outflow from the fund.  If the federal hwy trust fund had just been used for interstates as it was designed for, it would still be solvent.   By and large, we should buy stuff honestly.  What happens if you blow grocery money for running shoes?  You can't eat.  Not that running shoes are bad, but your budget is better setting aside running shoe money rather than sucking it out of essential spending.  Same at the govt level."

I'm not sure about the ""Dreamers"" because I didn't see any polls but the gas tax veto was also a good move on his part.    I think people in /r/omaha might sometimes forget they are the minority.  Ricketts isn't hurting himself, but he's winning more votes by making these political moves.  If anything the State Legislators voting against their constituents will are the ones that are putting themselves on the line.  Don't forget people voted for Ricketts knowing this is what he would be doing."
Omaha,37mana,i_just_want_downvote,7,Fri May 29 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"He is winning votes in rural Nebraska.  The senators are representing their constituents.  Nebraska is changing rapidly, because of the stability of our local economy people and businesses are moving here at a pretty fast rate.  This is bringing in educated people who tend to be more liberal and the uneducated workforce who also tend to be liberal.    The way the government is set up the executive branch reflects the votes of the whole state, while the legislative branch reflects more localized populations.  It was set up this way to give both rural and urban populations voices.  Well, here in Nebraska the two major population centers are Lincoln and Omaha.  27 of the 49 senators are from Lincoln and the Omaha metro area, which tend to be more moderate or even liberal.  You also see pockets of immigrant workforces in the west and central part of the state, who also tend to be more liberal.  Even though Nebraska is a traditionally red state, our population is changing and the politics of the state are going to shift.  This is all trends and partly my speculation, but I think that it gives the idea of where we are heading."
Omaha,37mana,FyreWulff,6,Fri May 29 10:41:30 2015 UTC,"A typical GOP line is that the ""real"" people want something else. They voted these reps in, Nebraska is getting exactly what it wants."

Omaha,37lpnx,AerThreepwood,7,Thu May 28 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to hangout at coffee shops. There's loads of them. Or the typical ""go to the bar"" scene. As far as fun things to do, that depends on what you enjoy - and may not necessarily be the best way to meet people. But seriously, check out coffee shops. When I first moved here I hung out at Starbucks. Met other people new to the area that way, befriended some Starbucks baristas, etc. Still hang out with all of them. You could go to Starbucks or any one of the plethora of coffee shops that have popped up over the past few years."

Omaha,37il7y,newchong,2,Thu May 28 11:13:07 2015 UTC,"I used to work at the Bike Rack, so I'm a little biased towards that, although if you want to buy new you will need to increase your budget no matter where you go (besides walmart). Especially if you want disc brakes.  My advice based on what you've told us? You're looking for a hybrid bike, although I'll be honest, there aren't exactly a lot of opportunities for mountain biking in NE. I rode the Wabash Trace Trail last week (crushed limestone) on road tires and did just fine. Disc brakes are only worth it if you'll be riding in the rain a lot, otherwise just allow yourself more room to stop when it's wet.  Cycling is my passion, if you have more questions just PM me"
Omaha,37il7y,JrDot13,1 point,Thu May 28 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"I got mine at The Bike Rack, they were really friendly and recommended a handful in my price range. Tested them all out in the parking lot and went up some hills around the area. Mine cost under $500 for a 2015 Trek with disc brakes. They also have clearances on 2014 models.   Specialized make some of the best mountain bikes (most pros ride them), but the starting cost of a new one it bit more pricey. Trek makes a good variety and has many price points."
Omaha,37il7y,gatormain32,0,Thu May 28 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know how anyone can feel safe riding on the street in the USA. I'd recommend sticking to trails. There are some decent mountain bike trails. http://www.trailshaveourrespect.org/trail-information/  Try and stretch your budget to $700-1000, because you get a lot more bike. You really do want hydraulic brakes and a half decent fork. You don't need full suspension around here. All the stores are pretty good. Just go to any of the stores and say you want a hardtail 29er with hydraulic brakes and a decent fork. Maybe a 27.5 for your GF. Bike rack, Bike way, Bike masters, Trek store all are pretty much the same. Trek store and Bike rack have closeout deals. Dont forget helmets."

Omaha,37il7y,dhess34,0,Wed May 27 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"If your budget is only $500 check craigslist for used bikes or Walmart for new. If you have an extra couple hundred you can spend on each one, Greenstreet Cycles at 24th & Harney will treat you pretty well. I paid $700 for a decent Specialized hybrid. Not sure what kind of prices they have on mountain bikes."
Omaha,37il7y,saltyjohnson,1 point,Thu May 28 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"What type of bike would you recommend?  I'd like it hit a trail every now and then, but the majority of my riding will be in town (small town outside of Omaha).  I didn't realize how many different categories of bikes they had.  I'm only familiar with mountain and street."
Omaha,37il7y,saltyjohnson,1 point,Thu May 28 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"I know very little about cycling, so I'm not necessarily the right one to ask. Specialized is a brand. Hybrids are basically adequate for street or light mountain biking. They're a little heavy for serious street rides, and not robust enough for really tough trails. Street bikes and most hybrids don't usually come with disc brakes (they add too much weight). I got a Specialized Cirrus Sport, and it's great for riding around town. I'm planning to take it on the Taco Ride soon, which is a pretty light mostly paved trail."

I have been to the Sioux Falls Jazz Fest a number of times, it's free, outdoors and has some pretty great acts every year. The best part about the Jazzfest IMO is the venue, Yankton Trail Park.  Its absolutely huge, so even if you have a good number of people out to enjoy the music it has never felt crowded, plenty of room to sprawl out on the grass and enjoy some live music and a cold beer.  Falls Park is also worth a look as well.  http://siouxfallsjazzfest.com/  http://www.siouxfalls.org/contactus/parks/public-parks/falls-park.aspx  I grew up in South Sioux and the Ponca State Park is great place for camping and hiking...Canoeing is an option as well. My brother, Dad, myself and another friend will drop in at NewCastle and canoe down the Missouri, docking at sand bars and soaking in some sun until we dock at Ponca State Park. The Missouri gets so wide and it's so quiet.  Its very serene and quite beautiful.  If you do spend a day hiking, camping or canoeing at Ponca State Park you may get a little hungry.....If you travel 16 miles southwest of PSP you will stumble upon the tiny town of Martinsburg. This barely-there town is the home of Bob's Bar--burgers the size of your head---Everything on the menu is served in ungodly large portions, the place is a complete dive, but you wont leave hungry. Its a fitting end to a day spent in the sun working up an appetite.    http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45780-d2303079-Reviews-Ponca_State_Park-Ponca_Nebraska.html  Also if you're a golfer, the town of Ponca actually has a very well kept golf course, kind of a diamond in the ruff.    http://www.highlandoaksgolf.com/  Cheers!"

Omaha,37cqt6,Xceptiona1,8,Tue May 26 19:25:44 2015 UTC,"IAmA Former Member of the Westboro Baptist Church  Nate Phelps:   I can state unequivocally that my father believes what he preaches with everything in him. He has spent his entire life parsing the bible and commentaries by former ""eagle saints"" and has concluded that his little church is the only source of truth left on the earth. If you aren't there under his tutelage and authority, you cannot have grace.  11 of my siblings are attorneys as well of many of their spouses. They have been raised in a belligerent environment their entire lives so fighting back is all they know. They use the law to protect themselves and have made money over the years of their picketing that they will gleefully admit to using in their picketing campaign. But that money is a drop in the bucket to the money they spend every year traveling around the country and world with their pickets. The lions share of the money comes from the tithes they give to the church. I'm told the expected amount was raised to 30 percent in the early stages of their campaign. I've done the rough numbers in my head and I can see that accommodating their professed expenses of $250,000 a year in travel costs. Remember that those dollars are not taxed since they are contributed to the church.     IAmAn Ex-Member of the Westboro Baptist Church  Nate Phelps:    Some have said, the WBC being a family of lawyers, that they are looking to create lawsuit opportunities.   The lawsuits happen. Their lawyers, their litigious as hell. But the lawsuits are only there as a way to intimidate and protect themselves. They sincerely believe what they are preaching.   Nate Phelps:    How much of the ""God hates fags"" stuff is real and how much of it is baiting for lawsuits?   They believe what they preach and use lawsuits to keep people from harassing them.   Nate Phelps:    How much money do you estimate your family has made via petty lawsuits?   Not that much. The bulk of the money they use to travel around and picket comes from the 30% tithe they are required to give to the church. Remember this is tax free money. I've roughed out the numbers before after I learned about this from a nephew that left and it fits the $250 to $300 thousand dollars they say they spend each year.   Nate Phelps:   The persistent myth that they do it for money is just false.     I am Lauren Drain, former Westboro Baptist Church member & author of BANISHED. Ask Me Anything  Lauren Drain:    Since it is my understanding that most of the members are lawyers, do they actually believe in what they preach, or is the WBC waiting for someone to violate their First Amendment rights so that they can sue the offender?   It is my belief that they actually believe what they preach. They have concocted such an elaborate doctrine and give no opportunity for the members to question it in their controlled environment. I don't know what the WBC is capable of. They continue to surprise me in their extreme views. I never thought I would see them trying to picket the victims of Sandy Hook elementary. I think they believe the more they are hated/persecuted by others, the more their faith is validated, a vicious cycle.     I am Zach Phelps-Roper. I am a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church. Ask me anything!  Zach Phelps-Roper:   A lot of you guys want to know if it's true that the objective of the church is to piss people off to the point of violence, sue, and gain profit. the answer is no. :)   Zach Phelps-Roper:    Did you ever get the impression that the family was just doing it for... Fame? Or something other than what they were actually saying?   Well, they literally believe every single word the preach and the goal is to get the most eyes and ears on the message as possible, so you could say the intention is for ""fame"" in that way.   Zach Phelps-Roper:    Have any of the ""higher-ups"" in the church explicitly confided in you that their protests are done for publicity? If not, do you think this to be the root of the protests?   No one at Westboro Baptist Church has ever told me that they did their preaching for publicity or for money... It is strictly their religious convictions that drive them to preach their message... They believe that if they don't preach the words that they are preaching, then they will BURN IN HELL when they die for all of eternity... They act out of fear for themselves and their children, and they will ex-communicate anyone, ever their own wife or children, to save their souls.   Zach Phelps-Roper:    Is there any truth to the belief that a big reason why WBC members protest in public is to instigate violence upon their members by the people being protested, only to turn around and slap those same people with civil suits?   Nope.   Zach Phelps-Roper:    Did you genuinely believe in what you were preaching against?   Yes, I truly believed the message of WBC at the time I was with them...     In response to my family's upcoming AMA, I thought I'd try this again: I am a former member of the Westboro Baptist Church. Ask Me Anything!  Zach Phelps-Roper:   No, the Westboro Baptist Church does NOT picket for the purpose of enticing people to hit them, sue, and make profit.   Zach Phelps-Roper:    How does WBC raise money to travel and picket?   They work and have good jobs.   Zach Phelps-Roper:    Did you really believe in the stuff that this hate-filled organization spews forth?   Every word."
Omaha,37cqt6,Moz,2,Wed May 27 05:49:09 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what their yearly income looks like? Are they living off of a large payout from years back or are there ongoing cases where they keep getting money?
Omaha,37cqt6,sorename,2,Tue May 26 19:46:10 2015 UTC,Not as many cases recently as everyone has caught on.  They have a lot of small and midsized judgements from what I have read.  I imagine that they have a steady cash flow from these.

Omaha,37cqt6,b0bx13,1 point,Tue May 26 21:42:41 2015 UTC,True. Thanks for helping support our fallen. My dad is an officer in CB and this show of support meant a lot to him.
Omaha,37cqt6,FluffyCuntPunt,3,Tue May 26 21:53:53 2015 UTC,5 protesters?  God Hates Protesting.
Omaha,37cqt6,bogartbrown,3,Tue May 26 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"There are only about 40 members in the whole WBC.  So, it's not a bad turn out for them."
Omaha,37cqt6,Conchobair,3,Tue May 26 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"Is there even that many anymore? The old man is dead, the grandkids leave when they can..."
Omaha,37cqt6,omahaks,4,Tue May 26 23:20:47 2015 UTC,The WBC is to Christianity as ISIS is to Islam.
Omaha,37cqt6,ElectricTurtlez,3,Tue May 26 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"Well there are 40 WBC members. ISIS has 20 to 30k plus fighters alone. So ideologically you may be on point, but from a practical standpoint, you are minimizing the effects of ISIS and the effectiveness of their radical message."

Omaha,37cqt6,venom_dP,11,Tue May 26 18:15:46 2015 UTC,The best thing that people can do is ignore them.
Omaha,37cqt6,ShellAnswerMan,4,Tue May 26 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"There's truth in this statement, but since the media can make money off their shenanigans they'll never fall out of the spotlight."
Omaha,37cqt6,venom_dP,7,Tue May 26 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"I think our media did a pretty good job of ignoring them, hence the lack of turnout.  I think the ""shock value"" they've relied on is fading fast."
Omaha,37cqt6,bogartbrown,3,Tue May 26 19:04:30 2015 UTC,I'm glad the local stations didn't mention them much at all. Almost all the stories online mention them thought IIRC
Omaha,37cqt6,venom_dP,1 point,Tue May 26 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"If they can't get good video, the media won't film them.  They came to Dundee Pres. for a soldier's funeral.  The sidewalks were blocked by people standing side to side with no sound.  The TV stations wouldn't film them because the video available wasn't compelling.  They can't push you away or they get an assault charge and if they touch one person, then they get a real arrest (and processing in the system) and they get sued for assault.  More importantly, they lose their big profit center.  Suing cops and towns for false arrest.  Once they get convicted of assault anywhere, they can no longer claim to be peaceful protesters arrested for no reason.  They lose their ground to sue.  That's why they didn't push anyone around who had the white sheets.  Any act of aggression on their part gets their whole game crashing down around them."
Omaha,37d0w1,Logilo,5,Tue May 26 19:01:02 2015 UTC,Really impressive show of support.  Quite moving.
Omaha,37fihh,omaknight,3,Wed May 27 06:36:00 2015 UTC,"Officer killed was a good cop and respected member of the community.  Heavily involved in sports and did a lot of coaching and other community activities.  Was a huge loss to the cops, the community, and to her premie daughter.  People were genuinely shocked by her death and experienced intense grief.  The efforts that came forth for her family were real and heartfelt.  She will be missed by a lot of people."
Omaha,37fihh,riverfan,4,Wed May 27 13:43:52 2015 UTC,Step 1) Look back into previous week of posts in this sub. Step 2) Look at any local news media or google her name. Step 3) Cliffs: Female officer shot and killed by suspect being arrested.
Omaha,37fihh,DickJuggle,0,Wed May 27 08:28:32 2015 UTC,As with many things asked in the r/Omaha sub one piece of advice.....GTS (GOOGLE THAT SHIT)
Omaha,37fihh,hercooleez316,1 point,Wed May 27 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"Recently, nationwide there has been a spotlight on cops shooting and killing people indiscriminately.  Nebraska passes legislation eliminating death penalty.  Cop got shot serving a warrant.  She died.  Suspect died.  Politics happen and Governor vetoes death penalty repeal.  Originally they had enough votes to overrule the veto, but people are stupid and short sighted and shitheads who politicize a death.  Rest of nation jumps on this to show that 'cops lives matter' even though that's an asinine stance because every life matters.  TLDR: A bad guy killed a cop and now they are playing it up in the media to justify state mandated murders, sometimes by cop, sometimes by judge and/or jury."
Omaha,37fihh,TheoreticalFunk,-5,Wed May 27 12:41:03 2015 UTC,"Naw, felony warrant, on the run and now a cop killer-at least the piece of shit is dead.  I could give zero fucks about this gang banging shitbag."

Omaha,37bs18,ericthgirw,1 point,Tue May 26 16:28:21 2015 UTC,My father and I use to pick them off trees and the house and hang them on towels in the bathroom. He would then wake us up when they begin to hatch out of their exoskeleton. I hope to do this with my 3 year old daughter. :) girlfriend isn't too pleased lol
