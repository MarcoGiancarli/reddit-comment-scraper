I think you biggest challenge is going to be the price depending on your location. You are either going to get something with 250k miles, needing headgaskets done, or other major work unless you are able to bide your time and find a great deal."
Battlecars,3c9mm9,AdamsHarv,3,Mon Jul 6 05:18:53 2015 UTC,"The first question to ask is: what sort of offroading are you planning on doing?  If you're just gonna drive down dirt roads, pretty much any car will do.  But if you're going to be in any mud, sand, snow, or jeep trails, you will probably want something with high-low 4wd."

With the new one I'd like to go through mud, jeep trails, and maybe some sand. Would the subaru awd work well for this or do you think high-low is a necessity?"

They don't make LSDs for them anymore and I don't know where/how one would get a diff locker. It's a crappy downfall, but people get by. Apparently half-engaging the E-brake will get the other tire to spin, but I haven't actually had an opportunity to try it. I still think they're the best car in the world, though."
Battlecars,3c0i6n,Lies_About_Gender,11,Fri Jul 3 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"Instead of telling you that this is dumb, I am going to point you towards looking at CRV parts. To be honest, I don't keep up with generational changes of Hondas, but I do recall that the first gen CRV was based on the AWD civic platform. You might find something useful there.  Edit: You also might find some support within the ""donk"" crowd. There might be spacers out there made for fitting dumb rims."
Battlecars,3c0i6n,L8sho,5,Fri Jul 3 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"http://www.rocky-road.com/honda-crv-lift-kit.html  This site sells actual CR-V lift kits. I don't know if they are good,  but I was planning on getting one from these guys eventually."
Battlecars,3c0i6n,ownage99988,7,Tue Jul 7 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"The problems here are many. With multilink or in this case a modified double wishbone suspension your gonna need to move the mounting points of the suspension down. So you will be fabricating a new rear subrame brace. Shouldn't be too hard with an engineering degree and the ability to prototype large pieces of metal.  You can't put a block on the spring without getting special longer shocks, or remove the rear shocks all together. But with that extension you will loose camber. You can probably adjust some of it out using the eccentrics but I think more then 1"" of lift and you will need to be modifying the control arm length.  And with the front, you could put a spacer on top of the macphereson strut but then your camber will be all positive (opposite of stanced) and you wont be able to turn very well. Another concern is when the spacer is installed those large suspension bushings will be under a constant stress they were not designed to handle. You may want to look into getting some custom front axles, too. If the lower ctrl arm is pulled down (or in this case pushed) enough the CV joints can separate.   So what I recomend is get an old blazer chasis, and mount your civic on that. Probably slightly cheaper way to achieve your desired look. Or look into buying a 2006 CRV as a parts car.   Good luck! Sounds like a fun project."

Battlecars,3c0i6n,NeilOMalley,2,Fri Jul 3 21:01:00 2015 UTC,I don't think an inch would make that much more clearance.  Your biggest issue would be the wheel well liner and fenders.  Also would depend on how much offset your wheels have.

The whole point of using a Silvia in the first place is that it's not the kind of car you would expect to be modified for post-apocalyptic off-roading. I think the Holdens shape isn't as aggressive as the Silvia so in my opinion it wouldn't have looked anywhere near as bad ass. They didn't want an easy build, they wanted a unique and challenging build and it turned out to be completely fucking awesome. Plus a Silvia with a V8 is fucking mad."

Battlecars,3aazvu,Cyfun06,4,Fri Jun 19 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"It did seem relatively slow, but these ain't 600bhp rallycross cars.  Listening to the engine note, they were giving it the beans on many occasions.  However, as this is such a long rally, they probably weren't familiar with the road, and didn't want to risk crashing.  Also, they DID pass a bunch of cars around 4:00, so they were definitely not the slowest ones there."

Truth is, all of their major faults are due to the public being unaware of how to properly maintain diesels, crap fuel at the time they were in use, and re-use of torque to yield head bolts.  They are certainly no great engine, by any stretch of the imagination, but they are in no way as bad as they are made out to be.  That said, none of that impacted my decision to put one in the car.

They're such great every-day cars, and trying to lift it and throw chunky tires on would make it less reliable, less fuel efficient, and handle like crap.  The only possible way it might not completely suck offroad is if yours has the automatic CVVT transmission and not the manual.  But either way, with no low range, no clearance, no traction, no articulation, and only 1-wheel drive... It's not worth it.  If you wanna offroad, I would recommend just getting a second vehicle. One that you don't mind beating up.  Also, there are a few videos of how these cars perform offroad."

However, in the end, even once the last payment is made, the luxury credentials are faded, dented, rusted away, and the noble Teutonic beast is relegated to becoming a $1000 Craigslist find, a BMW is still a performance machine with a throbbing heart that beats to thrash corners on the Nurburgring. There are so many out there who seek their services just for a name, to waste their potential and use them up, throwing them away once their employment no longer displays one's noble status. Yet, they still live on even once their original masters abandon them, they live the life of a mercenary roaming from banner to banner until the day they are crushed against the barrier on that final fatal turn and their roaring heart turns over for the final time, spilling out its oily coolant-tinged blood on the asphalt in a heaving explosive gasp of steam and sludge. Forever shall they feast on premium high-octane fuel in Valhalla, flogging the eternal corners of the afterlife. Their bodies may be broken and re-purposed into household appliances, but they will have met death as the true warrior they were always destined to be.

Battlecars,2yq842,Brad__Schmitt,4,Thu Mar 12 13:12:03 2015 UTC,Not only that but when racing we have to have the windows up and it gets hot in the car. So the scoop is the only way of getting any airflow into the car to help cool it down.

Battlecars,2yhum5,fishsticks40,3,Tue Mar 24 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"Well, you'll probably need to make a frame fit.  If you can't use stock frame length, you'll need to work out a new driveshaft length and get that custom made.  If you're going shorter you'll probably need to weld on new spring perches at the right angle.  You'll need to work out engine mounting and possibly build new upper shock mounts.  Possibly work out new radiator mounts for an oversized radiator vs. what came w/ the car.  Obviously this guy put a different bumper on.  Possibly different steering column, different offset wheels, body work to reshape wheel arches if you don't want to get the body too high, etcetera etcetera."
Battlecars,2yhum5,US_Hiker,3,Tue Mar 10 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"A battlecar isn't the same as putting a car on a truck frame.  A battlecar is a vehicle that is kind of intimidating looking, and that you'd potentially ride into battle... or at least not care if you beat it up a little while offroading.  To answer your question, you'd probably wanna start with the car body that you wanna lift.  Measure the wheelbase, and find a truck or SUV frame that is the same length.  If the truck frame is too long, you can shorten it if you're good at welding.  But you wouldn't weld the truck frame to your car, you'd bolt it up.  As most cars are unibody anymore (the frame is part of the body and not removable), you would have to do a fair amount of custom work, and it would probably sit up a bit higher as it basically has two frames.  The other option is to custom fabricate a frame, and mount up the truck engine, trans and axles, and then probably make your own suspension.  But that's a big commitment and a lot of work, and is only really done by serious offroaders or people with a lot of money to blow."

Battlecars,2vzx8f,Fiver2,3,Sun Feb 15 19:39:48 2015 UTC,What are the plans for it? And did that used to be a Grand Marquis?
Battlecars,2vzx8f,cdsbigsby,5,Sun Feb 15 23:41:00 2015 UTC,"Plan on building a cage where the body was, throwing some 33"" tires on it an for now one big ass go kart. Correct! Good eye, only has the 5.0 but maybe a turbo coming soon."
Battlecars,2vzx8f,cdsbigsby,3,Sun Feb 15 23:43:24 2015 UTC,.... Good god that is going to be fun.
Battlecars,2vzx8f,anfeline,2,Sun Feb 15 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"Ha! Thanks! Hope so! Think i'll go to the local PD to check what I have to have to be ""legal"". lol"

Battlecars,2v50zz,majoroutage,2,Sat Feb 7 23:35:56 2015 UTC,Very nice and cleanly built...but unfortunately in a way that makes it obvious it was never meant to really be used offroad.

Battlecars,2uytij,PigSlam,2,Fri Feb 6 15:31:13 2015 UTC,I always wonder how these things come together. Does somebody have both a 4wd frame AND a car with a non-functional driveline?
Battlecars,2uytij,FesteringNeonDistrac,2,Fri Feb 6 17:06:11 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that I need this in my life.

Not my vehicle of course.  Description from the listing: 87 Dodge shadow on 87 Dodge ram charger frame and drive train.

Battlecars,2otgrj,thesfg,4,Thu Dec 11 05:20:55 2014 UTC,I want one of these so bad
Battlecars,2otgrj,JP147,4,Wed Dec 10 07:30:09 2014 UTC,That's great. Always liked the Brat. Just seemed like a really fun car-truck to daily drive.
Battlecars,2otgrj,Cyfun06,2,Wed Dec 10 02:12:00 2014 UTC,I love these. Is that an EA81 or EA82? Also it looks like you might have a vac leak with the unplugged hole on the manifold.
Battlecars,2otgrj,JP147,2,Wed Dec 10 11:54:07 2014 UTC,All brats were EA81 even up to 87 along with the Hatchbacks.  Mine has an EA82 intake with a Holley 5200 carb on it.
Battlecars,2obubc,tpm319,2,Fri Dec 5 03:18:50 2014 UTC,"What size tires do you have currently? A very popular tire here and over at /r/battlewagon is the general grabber at2. I don't have any experience with them but I hear great things about the traction and durability overall.   As far as auxiliary lighting goes, a led light bar is always a great option due to the many different sizes and beam patterns along with the lower power consumption compared to halogen and hid."
Battlecars,2obubc,Shittypumpkin2,3,Fri Dec 5 03:45:52 2014 UTC,I have General Grabber AT2s on my '97 Pathfinder. Great tires.
Battlecars,2obubc,TitaniumTurtle,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:49:55 2014 UTC,"Sweet, thanks for the tire recommendations. Yeah I have seen a few of those LED light bars on amazon, I should snag one for <100 bucks."
Battlecars,2obubc,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Fri Dec 5 03:56:56 2014 UTC,Do you know how bad it would be to go from a 55 to a 65 profile tire?
Battlecars,2obubc,Krusha2117,7,Fri Dec 5 04:06:42 2014 UTC,"How to read a tire size. Example 215/70r15.   First number is the width of the tire in mm. 25.4mm is an inch. so 215/25.4 is roughly 8.5 inches.   Second number is the sidewall described as an ""Aspect ratio"" so its a percentage of the first number. 70% of 215 is 150.4 or roughly 6 inches, thats from the bead to the tread.  Third number is the dimensionaal height of the rim, obviously r15 is a tire meant for a 15"" tire. When taken into consideration with the aspectio ratio its easy to figure the overall diameter of the tire, 6+6+15=27. Continuing to use the example given below a 235/75r15 is actually 28.8 O.D. or just under two inches taller.   Now that you know how to measure a tire and what the sizes mean you can look at the clearances in your suspension and determine how large a tire you can fit, remember to look at full steering lock and strut compression measurements too."
Battlecars,2obubc,KiboshWasabi,1 point,Fri Dec 5 05:30:29 2014 UTC,FINALLY.  This is the definition I have been waiting for.
Battlecars,2obubc,Shittypumpkin2,1 point,Fri Dec 5 06:50:31 2014 UTC,"I wrote that in a sleep fog, its also worth mentioning the given example 215/70/15 vs 235/75/15, the latter is also 20mm wider, so nearly an inch wider but remember thats an inch split between the inside and the outside of the tire. The same principle works on overall diameter, a two inch taller tire will give you an inch more ground clearance and an inch less fender gap. An important distinction when measuring for clearances."
