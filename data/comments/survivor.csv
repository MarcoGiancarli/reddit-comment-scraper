You know, as if a 10-year relationship, whose ending was stated to be mutual, means that he's not allowed to be happy and marry someone else.  Not to mention the fact that I've NEVER heard anything about Ethan being the one that didn't want to get married. I always assumed that was also a mutual decision."

Most people are watching the show for entertainment, and having things get ~too~ dark pulls them out of that. The fact that everyone didn't just put the game behind them when all was said and done makes it feel a lot more real and uncomfortable and kind of not worth it.   That being said, I don't personally hate this season at all (though it's not a favorite for me) and I think it is an extremely fitting and important endcap for the original Survivor era."

survivor,3e34d3,purplerockpodcast,13,Tue Jul 21 18:39:55 2015 UTC,"I'm also a bigger fan than most of All-Stars, for generally the same reasons as OP. I like S8 as a ""dark"" variant of your typically much cheerier, more-positive Survivor season.  All-Stars is like a Greek tragedy, Shakespearean play, or AOIAF novel. Half the cast is dead by the end, while those who survive are worse off for their experience. Survivor legends meet with undeserved, ignominious downfalls, while smirking villains advance. And then although BRob is deservedly dragged over the coals by the bitter jury, his soon-to-be wife Lady Macbeth Ambah still gets the million for the both of them. In what world is that a just ending?  All-Stars subverts so many old-school Survivor themes: friendships matter, heroes win, alliances trump selfish strategy, and evil is punished. And its very name — All-Stars — is another subversion, since 1/3 the cast really don't deserve to be there, while those who do nevertheless fall flat on their face.  As someone who enjoys maximum variety in his life, I like All-Stars for being so unlike any other season. It's the ""Paint it Black"" version of Survivor, wonderfully dark and different."
survivor,3e34d3,vacalicious,4,Tue Jul 21 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"If All-Stars is Shakespeare, it's Titus Andronicus. There's no nuance to All-Stars; it's blunt maliciousness repeated ad nauseum. It lacks the character studies that make tragedies tragedies, so I have to disagree with that sentiment.  It's not beautifully unpleasant, it's just unpleasant."

I remember I didn't hate it, but then again I stopped watching Survivor after All Stars and didn't pick it back up till Gabon.  I rewatched it within the last few months and I liked the first few episodes until you get to the Sue Hawk quit episode and it just gets dark and not fun.  Because people are throwing away friendships (Boston Rob) and players like Amber, Shi Ann, Boston Rob, Alicia have no business being out there.  Listen to the survivor Historians Podcast about All Stars"
survivor,3e34d3,Rollout25,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Shi Ann was only really there because they didn't want to bring anyone else back from Thailand. Aside from Brian none really deserved to be brought back, and she did have more potential than many others. Brian was an unlikable guy on the show (and apparently off) so they probably went with Shi Ann for the reason. Plus ethnicity, they needed other non-white cast members. That could be why Alicia was there as well."
survivor,3e34d3,jenh6,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Shii Ann was arguably the most entertaining castaway from Thailand (well, at least of the ""laughing with"" and not ""laughing at"" variety).

Produced balked and got Shii Ann.  Funny thing was Kel from Thailand was a replacement in case one of the males had to pull out.  If Brian is cast I don't think Boston Rob is on All Stars. If Heidi accepted the offer probably Amber is not there either.  It's amazing to think a couple little casting choices go a different way and Survivor history is completely different.  I do agree that only reason you have Alicia and Shii Ann is for the minorities.   And they would rather of had Alicia instead of Velecipia."
survivor,3e34d3,Rollout25,4,Tue Jul 21 22:14:30 2015 UTC,"I loved All Stars the first time I watched it, because it aired in 2004 and I was 14/15 at the time. I rooted for Rob and Amber because I was a teenager and their love story was cute. I paid absolutely no attention to most of the other players (I had, up to that point, only watched Marquesas, Thailand and the Amazon). I hated Jerri only because the internet told me to. I had a dislike for Shii Ann because of how she played in Thailand. And I basically knew nothing about Hatch, Sue, Colby, Tom, Ethan, etc. At the time I watched it, the season was brilliant because the people I had wanted to get to the end had done so. And let's not even talk about that proposal during the Reunion, because that just made my 14-year-old little heart die of happiness.  I have since re-watched All Stars. I do not think it's a bottom tier season, but it's not nearly as exciting as it was the first time. I have a far better appreciation for the other players now who don't have a last name of Mariano. There are a few opinions I have that haven't changed. I still think Rob played a good game because he was one of the only people who didn't give two hoots about ""loyalty"" and ""friendship"" and ""honor"", and realized that this was a game. And not even a game against newbies - this was All Stars. He knew that he would have to play hard and dirty, and he did. I think his one flaw was allowing all the blame to be put on him. I think it cost him that extra vote he would have needed to win.   The case of extreme bitter jury is probably strongest in this one. I mean seriously, every single person on Chapera saw what Rob did to everyone else - starting with Lex (heck, maybe even starting with Cesternino) - and they still couldn't get it together long enough to get either Rob or Amber out. They really have no one else to blame but themselves.   I wish Hatch had stayed around longer, because he was absolute gold that season.   I also still think Lex is a total turd, but we don't have to go into that..."

I know I haven't hit the apparently 'really bad' post-merge, but from what I can see its shaping up nicely.

survivor,3e34d3,Shutupredneckman2,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember that Rob really was quite close to winning. Not only was the vote 4-3, but Shii-Ann said that her vote was up for grabs going into FTC, where Rob's (admittedly poor) jury performance lost it."

survivor,3e34d3,Shutupredneckman2,10,Tue Jul 21 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's exaggerated at best. Rob said one sentence; Amber lived with them for 3 days and convinced Kathy.

Yeah, that was real eye-opening when Lex wrote that. He also said that Kathy wanted to keep Amber because Kathy (his primary alliance) feared how close Lex and Jerri were becoming. Rob's plea to Lex certainly helped save Amber, but it sounds like Kathy was the main reason they chose to boot Jerri."

Also though they tried to give Rob more agency there to explain his loss and Lex's anger at FTC. If they put Amber's survival more on her, it looks weird when Rob gets punished. Also she's a woman and Production loves the idea of the protagonist saving his damsel in distress."
survivor,3e34d3,TioG,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:24:06 2015 UTC,"I call BS. Every shot of them talking strategy was Rob talking strategy to Amber.

Of course there's plenty we weren't shown, but I'm just not buying it. She was along for the ride. Rob just says they were in it 50/50 because, well, he married her."

survivor,3e34d3,dontworryiwashedit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"All-Stars displays what fundamentally makes me hate a season of Survivor -- an insanely obvious power player who will make it to the end unless someone does something about it, and a cast of players who do nothing to fight to stay in the game. Couple that with the fact that production upped the value for the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd place winners, and you create an environment where some of the greatest players of seasons 1-7 actively chose to not play the game for fear of losing their pay out.  I also hate Rob. I've hated him on all of his seasons and would be thrilled if he never showed up again.  That being said, I think All-Stars is an important season. Someone else said it's a great end cap for the beginning era of Survivor, and I'd agree. It's the first appearance of a true power couple and shows how dangerous that type of alliance can be to the other players. Also, it's a great example of how playing the game too hard can actually cost you the win. Still, this season was physically painful for me to finish and the only thing that made it worthwhile was the bitter jury at FTC when Rob finally gets his comeuppance."

survivor,3e05w4,wwxxwwxx,30,Tue Jul 21 04:16:15 2015 UTC,The Dan/Will stuff took up a lot of time at the finale; I know the general consensus of the cast was that you all were frustrated it overshadowed the season. Is there anything you want to say about it?
survivor,3e05w4,chrisjmu,121,Mon Jul 20 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"I think we had the recipe for one of the greatest seasons ever to be played out - by the numbers. Jeff told us this. We had 2 early, split-vote TCs; we had a thrown challenge work out for good; no medivacs or quitters; 16 votes negated by idols; 3 correctly played idols; a fake idol made and played; an idol fake-played; fire at the end. So for the recipe being so good... and the end product being what we saw... I think there were a lot of us who felt that our season wasn't as celebrated the way we wanted to celebrate it."
survivor,3e05w4,soundinsight,9,Tue Jul 21 00:19:09 2015 UTC,I'm sure the good news is that the all-stars (pretty much you apart from few people) are beloved by your close knit connection that very few if any season has. So there's that.
survivor,3e05w4,TheMarshmallowBear,14,Tue Jul 21 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"I think we can also attribute it towards the editing. Personally, I feel as though that the edit didn't even give any doubt at all towards the fact that you would win. I feel if they had made it more ambiguous and hyped up Carolyn just as much, then it would have been far more successful."
survivor,3e05w4,PopsicleIncorporated,18,Tue Jul 21 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"Truth be told I really think that the product could have been a top 3 season if it was handled just a little differently, as is though I would say that it is upper middle tier."

Did you ever feel (during the challenges) that anyone was close behind you?  2) In the very first immunity challenge you had a bit of trouble undoing the knots, but redeemed yourself with the puzzle. If the blue collars ended up losing that challenge, do you think you may have gone home that night?"
survivor,3e05w4,JennnnZeeee,33,Mon Jul 20 23:06:56 2015 UTC,The only one that really felt close was Sierra in the ball-maze. She got it all the way to the middle really quick while I was going slow. Rodney I felt I could've held out forever against. I knew the first section of the maze because my mom helped me with that and then blew through the rest of it. Nobody was really that close in the end except for Sierra. That's why she had to go!  Dan was always going home first. My name legitimately never was brought up until 9. People said I had a horrible social game but I was never on the lips of anyone until I blew it up - so immunities and Idol were the only way to go.

survivor,3e05w4,tollie,15,Tue Jul 21 00:58:16 2015 UTC,"Hey Mikey, saw you at the pre-finale shindig being the life of the party. Of course, being a day away from officially being a millionaire might do that to a person.  My two questions:   How confident were you in the win over Carolyn & Will after leaving FTC? Did you get a inkling you won from the other jurors before heading back to the states? Due to this, did you purposely not campaign hard for your Cambodia spot because you knew that you'd be disqualified regardless? Or were you comfortable that due to recency bias you'd have gotten on even if you lost FTC to Carolyn?"
survivor,3e05w4,AardvarkianStan,41,Mon Jul 20 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"When we left FT I was like 97-99% sure I won the game. When we got home, there was a good 2-3 weeks I really questioned it. Then watching it, the very 1st episode, where Lindsey talks about the winner being on the mat, I knew. No one ever told me their vote, but I was pretty confident about Shirin and Jenn, that Joe would respect the 5 wins, Hali would follow the group. FYI, the 1st 4 jury members are THE most important votes - because they are at tribal the longest. Tyler was my only question mark all the way til the end.  We weren't allowed to campaign as hard as everyone else. I knew that I won the game, and that I wasn't going, but I still wanted to play the part of not revealing my hand to America at CBS' request. It was like I got to play Survivor with the fans this time!"
survivor,3e05w4,soundinsight,14,Tue Jul 21 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"Hello Mike, thanks for being here. I have a few questions. As you know, edits can skew the audiences perception of a player so that it is vastly different than what we see. With that being said, what were were your thoughts on your fellow castaways while you were out there? And how bored were you and Will during that long firemaking tiebreaker? Last but not least, did you know you won after FTC, and what was your reception at Ponderosa? Sorry for all the questions."
survivor,3e05w4,leeseedee,24,Mon Jul 20 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"Tyler was able to manipulate the whole group in pointing out negative/crazy attributes in other people. Sierra played the part of walking the fence - you thought she was with you until she wasn't. Rodney... oh Rodney. We all thought Rodney was just an idiot but the edit showed he pulled an alliance together well and held it together. I think Shirin had Will pretty much pegged. Dan broke my heart in the game, because I really thought we were gonna be good buds in the game, all the way til the end. He couldn't beat me so I had to go, and since he lost I had to get him.  Not bored, it was hilarious because they couldn't get it. The longer it took the worse they looked for the Jury. Everyone was real nice, except for Rodney, who was standoffish but also sick. It was strange because I was still guarded in a sense and not prepared to let the walls down. But then we started to tell each other our lies in the game and it became real life after that."

He didn't for the advantage but it looked like he isn't bid on any food either. Was he waiting for a different advantage, was the food he bought just edited out, or did he just need the $500 that badly?"

Anyone in particular you were concerned you wouldn't be able to beat if you were sitting next to them at FTC? You were seriously skin and bone by day 39. How much weight did you lose out there? What was the biggest surprise to you when you watched your season compared to what you expected to see on TV? Excluding Worlds Apart, what are your favorite and least favorite seasons of Survivor?"

I was just wondering if you could tell me more about the decision to send the f4 tc to a tiebreaker. Did you do this because you were genuinely afraid of Rodney beating you in the Ftc, as he claims? How confident were you of winning the million dollars at that point?  I also wanted to ask you about your argument with Lindsey related to religion. What did you say that made her so annoyed? Did you understand her point of view or did you feel her attack was unjustified?"

My question is, what was going through your head when you stood up for Shirin against Will in that whole argument? I think that was one of the better moments of the season, and I'm curious if there was anything more to it than we saw, or if you could tell us more about what you were feeling and thinking there. Thanks a ton, I enjoyed watching you this season and was happy that you won!"
survivor,3e05w4,soundinsight,38,Mon Jul 20 23:13:53 2015 UTC,My only thought was to grab her and get out of there because I knew the rest of them were in group-think mode and that Will didn't like her and it seemed like an attack. I grew up with some crazy stuff in my life and it kinda took me back there and I wanted to get her out of there as fast as I could.

For example, Tyler didn't receive a confessional on the Episode that he won the Immunity Idol, Rodney's edit made him look in a worse position to win than he actually was, while with your edit of you finding the HII was a bit over the top and felt very winner-ish to many.

survivor,3e22uf,PopsicleIncorporated,23,Tue Jul 21 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"I think this more shows that being ""dominant"" isn't necessarily a good thing.  But I do agree with you that a lot of people don't recognize how close he was to losing, and also that he's less dominant than the edit made it appear - per various post-show interviews, the women played a big role in deciding the order of the Pagonging while Grant was the first one to suggest blindsiding Matt, which was later - like probably most other things in Survivor - conferred upon by a core group."
survivor,3e22uf,DabuSurvivor,15,Tue Jul 21 10:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was incredibly dominant. Creating something like the buddy system, to me, shows how much control he had. It's a ridiculous idea, and pretty much any other player ever would have been torn apart for suggesting it, but Ometepe accepted it because of how much control Rob had. And honestly, the fact that he brought his choice final 3 to the end and manage to drag Phillip the entire way when the rest of the tribe wanted him gone is just a further example of how he dominated the game."
survivor,3e22uf,CalebPaasche,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:19 2015 UTC,"I think the buddy system is really blown up to be too much. Do you want to know why most of the Ometepe's didn't talk to the Zaps? Because three of them were young women who probably had nothing in common with the older Zaps, Phillip who was playing a character and Grant who didn't seem all that social to begin with."
survivor,3e22uf,RPSDivine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:06:11 2015 UTC,Grant was very social.  His edit just didnt show it that well.   Andrea was also.   Natalie was an airhead and anti social.   Ashley seemed abrasive but also was apparently much more social than her edit showed.   Phillip is just an asshole.
survivor,3e22uf,beyoncerocks,5,Tue Jul 21 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"i thought it was dominant in the way he handled his alliance, but the way the two praised rob at FTC and basically kissed his ass while making themselves look like goats was just insane to me."
survivor,3e22uf,stupidtyonparade,7,Tue Jul 21 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"I think it was still a dominate game, he just got lucky that it worked out for him because in most situations, he would have lost. I think what you take away from Rob's victory is that winning in the fashion he did is very difficult and you require a whole lot of luck."
survivor,3e22uf,RPSDivine,5,Tue Jul 21 12:37:45 2015 UTC,"Except practically every win in survivor history has required a whole lot of luck, some to an even greater extent than Rob's."
survivor,3e22uf,phone101,4,Tue Jul 21 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't disagree with your comment that winning Survivor requires a whole lot of luck and that there were other players out there who may have required more luck. I just think that playing a game like Rob's is not necessarily the best strategy to win the game, especially if you aren't particular perceptive enough to identify the goats."
survivor,3e22uf,RPSDivine,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"Oh of course it's not for everyone, it is very tough to pull off, but I think it was the best game choice for Rob given his history and the situation he was put in."
survivor,3e22uf,phone101,7,Tue Jul 21 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that he played the best game choice for himself, but I just think it's the best game choice for himself because he plays a game with a lot of consistent traits each time he played. He was sociable with those he was aligned with, rough around the edges with those he wasn't (even to the point of alienating and irritating them), he cut the throats of those he made personal connections with in a manner that lacked remorse and was extremely perceptive. I think his four showings indicate what type of player he is - somebody who usually either goes pre-merge because he led the wrong alliance or he makes far in the game because he managed to cobble together a loyal alliance.   If Boston Rob stuck around longer in Marq and HvV and he found himself in the dominate alliance, I guarantee Sean and Tyson/Coach would have been knifed around final 4-6, and he probably would have tried to bring an UTR female to the finals with him."
survivor,3e22uf,RPSDivine,16,Tue Jul 21 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"Also, the fact that people on here criticize Rob's RI game because he brought the two people he could beat to the end only happens because most people here don't like Rob. By most accounts, Denise would have lost to Malcolm in the Philippines but people here consider here a top 5 winner. Seems a bit hypocritical to me and based solely on the fact that people on this board dislike Rob."
survivor,3e22uf,CalebPaasche,12,Tue Jul 21 12:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think bringing the 2 worst players and people of the whole game to the end is very impressive personally.   Not easy to do, and if you need to to win, all the more impressive."
survivor,3e22uf,ohashibiles,8,Tue Jul 21 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that, while it's impressive Rob managed to get to the end with the 2 people he could beat, Natalie and Phillip were the ONLY 2 people he could beat. That just shows that Rob is very poor at socializing with other castaways and not coming off as arrogant.  On the other hand, it would admittedly be a toss-up with Denise vs. Malcolm in the finals, but she had a chance at beating him. She obviously beat Skupin and Lisa, and she also probably could have beaten fellow Dangrayne members Abi, Artis, Pete, Jeff, RC and maaaybe Penner and Carter (correct me if I'm wrong on some of these, I haven't seen Philippines since it aired).  I'm not even a huge Denise fan, but she was very good at coming off as threatening but not too threatening, and likable but not too likable. As a result, there are multiple scenarios where she could have won in the finals, whereas Rob only had one."
survivor,3e22uf,lemmylime,7,Tue Jul 21 13:34:41 2015 UTC,"If anything, Rob being a generally unlikeable individual makes his win even more impressive. Assholes can have a hard time winning (see Russell Hantz, Sash, Missy, etc) even if they have some strategy to play up in FTC."
survivor,3e22uf,BelcherSucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:55 2015 UTC,Russell is the anti Rob.  He doesnt bring the best people to the end.  He doesnt even have a clue the kind of people juries like (eg- thinking Natalie W and Sandra were goats).   That plus he is an even bigger asshole and even more unlikeable than Rob is.
survivor,3e22uf,beyoncerocks,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:56 2015 UTC,this was rob's 4th game so that's a pretty unfair comparison
survivor,3e22uf,sam4180,6,Tue Jul 21 14:09:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the fact that it's his fourth time really changes it much, considering we're comparing specific seasons/games and not their overall ability as a player."
survivor,3e22uf,CalebPaasche,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:43 2015 UTC,"i completely disagree. it's blatant in every returnee vs non returnee season. the new guys get killed and danced around strategically, and at least one returnee always makes it to final tribal. it's a culture shock to all the other castaways aside from Rob and Russell who are able to immediately start playing the game. it's really just a fact."
survivor,3e22uf,sam4180,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:35 2015 UTC,Denise would have beaten anyone but Malcolm. She had 9 options in merge. Rob could only beat Nat and Phil. He had 2 options.
survivor,3e22uf,Shutupredneckman2,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's necessarily true- it depends on the situation. If Rob had been sitting at the end with two Zaps (after going on a challenge run or something), he'd probably get the Omotepe vote and win."
survivor,3e22uf,CalebPaasche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"Well if the Zaps won out that'd require Matt and Andrea and/or 2 other Omes to have flipped, so I dunno. I don't think he'd get Ome votes anyway because it was his fourth time and he was a douche."
survivor,3e22uf,Shutupredneckman2,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"I agree there.   Rob should be praised for bringing the 2 biggest goats in the history of the show perhaps to the end.  Especialy knowing he would be facing a bitter jury who didnt like him much.     That is actually much harder than what Kim did, which was just bringing whoever she wanted to the end since nobody was any threat."
survivor,3e22uf,beyoncerocks,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"Although I think Kim's win is one of the very best ever, I agree with you. Due to both the makeup of the jury and the players involved, Kim would have won against any of the final 6, in any combination, so all she had to focus on was getting to the end. Rob had to get to the end and bring Natalie/Phillip along with him."
survivor,3e22uf,CalebPaasche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"I dont know that he WOULD have lost to Andrea, however its the fact he realized he needed to get out his original final three in favor or the two goats... I think the last 6 days were his finest... He did luck out, I think if you switched him and Russell, Rob would have been voted out pre merge.  Russell's tribe seemed to have more game savvy people where Rob's just salivated over everything he said, though its tough to say as Rob had such a social game and Russell didnt, but I do remember Russel's tribe was like 'returning players got to go'"

survivor,3e46an,FarmTaco,6,Tue Jul 21 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"I was completely out of the survivor internet world during Caramoan and wasn't spoiled at all. Thought Cochran and Malcolm were both great characters to watch. The season sits well with me but I understand why it doesn't with other people, especially those who knew what would happen."

survivor,3e46an,FarmTaco,6,Tue Jul 21 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like the editing and casting of Caramoan was morally questionable at best and abysmal otherwise. Boiling down a great Brenda/Dawn arc into the catalyst for a witch hunt, casting Francesca just to get toyed with by Phillip, and casting Brandon in anticipation for another meltdown to gawk out is really not cool."
survivor,3e46an,TheNobullman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:00 2015 UTC,I agree that Francesca getting another chance was a joke. But I thought everything else was entertaining. I'm sure the Brandon meltdown was pretty unexpected
survivor,3e46an,jlim201,3,Tue Jul 21 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"All-Stars, yes, I do enjoy it, so I can't comment on that. Caramoan, well I found it to have more dark themes than All-Stars (it was tolerable in All-Stars), Caramoan had 4 or 5 non-fans on their fans tribe, and the favoritism in fans of the favorites was questionable. There was tons of pre-gaming, very spoiled. Horribly edited, certain characters completely disappeared, or suddenly appeared (Sherri, Brenda)."
survivor,3e46an,jlim201,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Micronesia was made up of a bunch of recruits as well IIRC.   And I think the dark themes (other than Brandon Hantz) might have just gone right over my head, could you explain further?  Here is what I'm getting from your comment and my views. Caramoan was bad but not boring. Is that accurate?"
survivor,3e46an,Theryanbrault,2,Tue Jul 21 21:36:13 2015 UTC,"Micronesia had 2 recruits, which I believed had watched the show at some points. Caramoan had 6, some who had never watched the show.   Caramoan had not boring parts, but did have plenty of boring parts too."

survivor,3e46an,EL_Gordoz,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the hate for Caramoan was due to the fact that it was so heavily spoiled. IIRC, the final 3 was known before episode 1 aired. The season definitely improves (if only by a little bit) if you go in not knowing the winner."
survivor,3e46an,EL_Gordoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:46 2015 UTC,"Don't know if that's true. HvV, Nicaragua, Philippines and BvW were also heavily spoiled, and the F3s were all over the internet very early on. HvV and Philippines are considered among the best, BvW is considered ok to decent by most people, and Nicaragua is more polarizing, but has lots of fans despite it being heavily spoiled."
survivor,3e46an,insubordinance,2,Tue Jul 21 22:01:34 2015 UTC,All Stars- I consider it one of the best but I get why people didn't like it much. I liked most of the cast and Boston Rob played a great game. It was a tough watch but I think its one of those seasons that took Survivor to a whole new level.   Caramoan- It was bad for many reasons from editing to casting. Its theme is Fans vs Favorites with half a tribe of actual fans and half recruits. The favorites tribe was just a joke. 3-4 of them were just to cause controversy. It was more like productions favorites instead of fan favorites.
survivor,3e46an,jlim201,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"For Caramoan, isn't that the exact recipe that production used for Micronesia? The fans tribe was half recruits, and the favorites included ""productions favorites"" (ex. Fairplay)."
survivor,3e46an,eda37,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:01 2015 UTC,A majority were actual fans if I'm correct. With a couple recruits who I believe were fans. Not like Reynold who had never seen an episode or Shamar who I bet never saw an episode but they found on the internet through a viral video. The favorites in Micronesia were to me actual favorites. Even Fairplay. was he stunt casted probably but it didn't matter because a majority of the favorites were favorites.
survivor,3e46an,nakothenacho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't know that, I guess it's easy to dislike it a bit after hearing that. But did you not think the season was unpredictable and entertaining?"

People who probably saw the show before in Caramoan: Allie, Sherri, Michael, Matt.   It's not a huge difference (6/10 vs. 4/10) but that's still a difference."

But if you don't want to read all of that, the main problems include:    casting: 3/5 fans were hot young blondes you could barely tell the difference between, maybe 2 or 3 favorites were actual favorites  editing: Shamar, Brandon, Phillip, Malcolm, and Cochran took up over half the airtime. Reynold, Andrea and Dawn got a decent amount. That's pretty much it. storytelling: Characters' roles changed very often for seemingly no reason. Premerge, Reynold/Eddie are the douchebags who isolate themselves into the ""cool kids"" alliance, but postmerge they become the heroic underdogs. Sherri is the leader of the dominant alliance on Gota early on, but quickly disappears and becomes completely useless. Brenda is basically not in the season for the first ~10 episodes, then becomes a big hero who was ruthlessly betrayed by her friend Dawn... a relationship we barely saw. All of these things happened with no explanation why.   Couple that with Probst's hype and other weird stuff like Brandon's meltdown and Malcolm randomly finding an idol in a really sketchy sequence of events, and you have a pretty terrible season."

Didn't feel too strongly about it the first time I watched it, but after a second viewing I've grown to appreciate it for the colorful cast. Not a season with spectacular gameplay, but definitely a strong cast of characters.  You've probably heard everything there is to say about Caramoan. It's not very good. The cast was filled with duds on both tribes and the edit was incredibly lopsided. Post-merge isn't too bad, has some good tribal councils, however the general ugliness of the season really ruins it."

This season has a small amount of really good strategy with a lot of social game and a view of the environment.  I haven't watched Thailand, but I heard it was pretty good, same with Guatemala.

survivor,3e0xw7,Kheinom,25,Tue Jul 21 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"Despite Luzon possibly having a better win ratio than the other horrible tribes, I would argue that they are probably the worst tribe ever. The rest of those tribes weren't necessarily terrible, they were simply outmatched. Matsing in particular was just pound for pound weaker than the other two tribes. Ulong was just, on average, weaker than Korror. Similar story with Fang. Ravu was dragged down by a horrible twist that pretty much guaranteed they would never win. Despite all of this, I wouldn't argue that those tribes were terrible, they just weren't as good.  Luzon, on the other hand, actively went out of their way to screw up in every way imaginable. They booted two of their strongest challenge members immediately, failed to even make a usable shelter within the first 3 days, lost ""literally 98%"" of their rice, and kept the one person who pretty much wrecked the tribe at every possible opportunity for the entirety of their existence. It's not like the Brains tribe was just barely outmatched by everyone else, they actively weakened themselves at pretty much every opportunity and ensured they could never win a challenge. The only solid performance they had in a challenge was offset when they allowed the mole J'Tia to do the puzzle, which she proceeded to screw up worse than anyone could have possibly imagined. They didn't have a single good challenge performance in their entire time as a tribe. Even the one immunity they did win was a horrible effort; they just somehow got outsucked by another tribe.  TL;DR: Luzon lost a challenge against a tribe that was trying to throw it. 'Nuff said."

It's in Korean of course, and the culture takes a little getting used to, but overall, this show episode for episode has entertained me more than survivor (I'm sorry).  Anyway, OP you may want to check out Crime Scene, another Korean show, it even features Hong Jinho (he was on the Genius for those who don't know).  Different format than Survivor/Genius, but fun to watch either way.  In short, every episode, the contestants are suspects and one is a criminal, they then must examine a crime scene to deduct the criminal.  It starts off a little slow, and I hear season 2 is the better half (I've only seen S1), but it's definitely worth the watch."
survivor,3e0ks6,TheMuffinMan98,10,Tue Jul 21 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Survivor, I really think The Genius is the better designed game.   For those who don't know, each round consists of a Main Match and a Death Match. The Main Match is usually a free for all game with opportunities for cooperation and betrayal. The winner is safe and gets to choose somebody aside from the loser to also be safe. The loser chooses somebody who isn't safe to face in a 1-on-1 game to decide who is eliminated.  The Main Matches are structured in such a way that you can win if you get people to trust you and then betray them. However, because only two people can be safe, groups of 3 or more are often unstable. Additionally, instead of trying to be first, you can work to make somebody else last, but they might pick you for the death match if you didn't win. Also, burning bridges can haunt you in future rounds.  Also, the editing is fantastic because they aren't afraid to hide information from the audience. Strategies that a winning player comes up with are often as much of a surprise to you as they are to the losing contestants."

Also it definitely has a ""Clique-y"" feel to it, where the ""veterans"" (people who played more) target the noobies, so some seasons can have a predictable boot order. A lot of the ""immunity"" challenges are also anti-climatic, boring, and really a test on how fit a person is. The elimination challenges are entertaining though.  TL;DR: be prepared with overwhelming cast division, ""it's better to do it IRL than watch others do it on TV"" competitions, and little to none strategic gameplay."
survivor,3e0ks6,lcove,3,Tue Jul 21 03:51:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. The worst thing is that they keep bringing the same people over and over again with newbies every other season. Is like having constantly a Fans vs Favorites season. The gimmick wore out for me a long time ago.
survivor,3e0ks6,m4milo,2,Tue Jul 21 04:50:55 2015 UTC,"I partially agree. If OP is like a 20 something or a high school student, it might be good. It's difficult to get into without watching previous seasons or the real world beforehand. I watched the real world religiously and loved the challenge. Once I stopped, the challenge didn't seem interesting anymore. It's such a stupid show with so much drama, but I can see how people might like it."
survivor,3e0ks6,colorthemap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't like that the Sole Survivor is determined by a jury vote and would rather watch people endure an extremely physically and mentally grueling final race to determine the winner, the Challenge might be up your alley. The final challenge in the first Rivals season is about 300 times worse than anything Survivor has ever done.  If you want the season that's closest to Survivor, watch The Island. Instead of putting them up in a luxurious house like they normally do, they actually made it Survivor-style and made them live outside. Cast was not happy.  Show has actually been on longer than Survivor, albeit with fewer seasons (they don't always do 2x per year).  It's dumb, it's petty, there's grudges and a rookies vs. veterans vibe, but it's really not any worse than BB."

Both players had nerve damage on the bottom of their feet from that challenge so imagining that Tom only had a little bit left in him shouldn't be that hard.  Ian VS Katie - Ian wins.  Ian VS Tom - Tom wins, but a lot closer.

I wish there was no such thing as bitter juries then Rob who played such a great game could have taken someone respectable to the end and still won, but he knew better.  One world- Chelsea is entertaining but lets face it she is a pretty big goat, and not a good or smart player.     South Pacific- Albert is an embarassment and another huge goat.  Caramoan- Sherri, lol!   Dawn by the end was nearly as bad, but I wont say she is a total goat as she played a hard game, but that whole tooth thing will haunt her forever.  Cagayan- Either Woo or Kass are embarassing in their own way (I know Kass didnt technically make finals since Woo is so stupid and embarassing).  One World- Will Simms.   Dan Foley was supposed to be there, but he was so stupid he couldnt even finish his easy ride to the finals as a goat.  Phillipines- Michael Skupin is another comical finalist, but atleast he was entertaining, and the memories of him to fans arent all bad.  Gervase and Monica were goats, but atleast they arent punchlines for jokes like Natalie, Phillip, Sherri, Albert, Lilian, so I wouldnt mind being them despite being goats.   Same goes for Natalie Anderson's minions/chosen final goats, thy were goats, but they atleast arent remembered just to be laughed at (in part since each got a vote from a family member) so I wouldnt mind being them.   Actually the same would be true of Chelsea who despite being a goat on a horrible season as a Kim friend/minion is very popular and respected.

Of course he will probably take the useless and disliked Phillip and Natalie to the end.    People like Grant and Ashley especialy were so sure he would take them to the end and possibly lose instead of take an obvious goat he was 100% sure to win over.   Ashley imparticular was dumb as she and Rob werent even close so why would he ever take her over a goat.  Ashley was so sure it was a Natalie-Rob-her F3 and Grant thought it was a Phillip-Rob-himself F3.   I can understand them liking those as Grant imparticular could win that F3 in front of a bitter jury (and it was a bitter jury), but they were overly confident those would come out.

Surely he should expect the way he plays this is almost sure to happen right and be ready for it?   Why be so surprised for instance that Grant would cut him off, after All stars when several cut him off?  If anything he should be shocked to lose only 1 friend from RI vs the handful from All stars and be satisfied with that.     Although Grant and Lex are the only two he still talks about so he must have felt those two friendships were especialy close (despite that he didnt know Grant ever outside of the game) and hurt him the most to lose.

I am not saying he should change how he plays.  Just expect to lose some friends given how he plays is all and dont be upset by it.  I do wish he and Grant would make up though.  I loved their bromance on the show.  I do think Rob really liked him too.  I am pretty sure that is the only vote off he ever felt genuinely bad about.

survivor,3dyb9s,TheNobullman,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:40 2015 UTC,I wonder if Chris burning Julie and Julie dating Jeff is why Chris has never really been in the Survivor world since?
survivor,3dyb9s,WilburDes,4,Mon Jul 20 17:42:53 2015 UTC,I think it has something to do with it for sure. I have heard that Jeff doesn't like Chris much as a person/winner and was pissed about how Chris punked her out.

Corinne being okay with it could have completely swayed the jury.  If Dawn hadn't blabbed about Corinne, Cochran probably wouldn't have figured it out until it was too late. In that one move, Dawn altered every future vote; they just had to figure out the order. Whether or not she would have won is up in the air but I do think she deserves far more credit."

He forgave him enough to talk to him some post game, but it was most likely Grant letting him down gently or giving it a try.  They were never likely remaining friends.   Grant would see watching Rob never had him in his F3 and that would be enough.  Anyone who thinks they would still be great friends without the idol game as some others claim is an idiot.

survivor,3dyz51,are_you_trolling,7,Mon Jul 20 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed watching Solitary for some of the same reasons I enjoy watching Survivor.  Solitary is probably the only show I've seen that is arguably more brutal than Survivor.  For anyone reading who might be interested, I think it's available on Hulu.  I recommend skipping the first season, because 1. the game was new and they hadn't really found the groove yet and 2. the voice of ""Val"" is obnoxious in the first season (maybe better for tormenting the contestants, but it tormented me as a viewer too).  Also, Season 2 features a former Survivor Player (John Palyok from Vanuatu.)  If you enjoy watching people be voluntarily tortured and tormented and broken down through starvation and sleep deprivation and outright emotional manipulation/abuse, Solitary is a great show.  The format for challenges and such is really quite unique and interesting, IMO.  Effectively, each player chooses when they want to quit, but they don't know when the other players have quit, and the first to quit goes home.  This leads to people enduring pain and torment long after they need to just so they can ensure that they don't lose.  It's so brilliant and sadistic."

Along the lines of what OP suggests, I tried the NBC show The Island. It wasn't bad, but I just kind of quit watching along the way. I will probably pick it back up on Hulu towards the end of the season. I've also discovered there are full UK seasons on Youtube, maybe two or three seasons worth, if anyone is interested."

Mario Lanza delivers this explanation:  When it comes to most of the big over the top characters in Survivor history, if you're like me, you spend half the season thinking, ""You know, there's a chance that this person is actually nuts.  You know, like actually certifiably crazy.  There's a chance that's what we could actually be looking at here.""  With Shambo in Samoa though, it's not like that.  With her, it is sort of the other way around.  I swear, most of the time during Samoa I wasn't sitting there wondering if there was a chance that Shambo was nuts.  With her, I was wondering if there was a chance she actually wasn't nuts.  Because I assumed that she was.  So I spent all season looking for evidence in the other direction.  I spent all season looking for some small bit of evidence that she actually was playing with a full deck -- that maybe the editors just made up this complete train wreck of a player, and that everything we were seeing was editing.  Sadly, I never found it.  There was no evidence.  At no point during Samoa was I convinced that we were looking at anything other than an actual crazy person."

She was doing the best she could. It was the saddest thing you've ever seen in your life. You can't tear into that shit. It'd be like going to the Special Olympics and whipping condoms at them so they never reproduce. Confessionals wouldn't affect my game (or maybe that's wrong. Who knows?) but trashing the obviously developmentally disabled would make me a monster. She was a nightmare but I wasn't going to take advantage of her like that.""

For two, there is a scene where he gives SRU 2.0 their names, and he clearly is hamming it up to the camera AND his favorite tribemates joined him in hamming it up. It goes from  normal to, ""WAIT, cameras are rolling, gotta act wild!"" very quickly and I think is a good example of Phillip acting a showman, especially considering his tribemates joining him in silly poses and shit for the camera and them all acting normal shortly prior."

He may be good at it, doesn't make him not addicted to smash. Also, was not well versed socially, probably from playing the video games. Isn't it an addiction when it negatively impacts your life in a degree that you don't date anyone at 25? Since you wanted to defend him...  And, it's an e sport. Not a sport.  And, if he wanted to manage playing video games into a career, there are better e sports to play in terms of popularity and getting paid.

survivor,3dzcxk,HellsWindStaff,4,Tue Jul 21 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Well, until now I didn't realise how (in my eyes) fundamentally flawed your perception of this matter was. You probably don't care enough to be bothered to change your opinion (which is fine) but I'll present an alternative anyway:   Regarding all the 'not well versed socially from playing the video games' points, its an extremely social scene with regular tournaments and meetups, requiring you interact with strangers. There are some people (see Mew2King) who many people say had his social skills significantly improved by participating in the competitive smash gaming scene. The lack of dating isn't great, but I would say is at least in part due to a vast majority of women holding a similar viewpoint to the one you hold - if anybody plays video games a lot its an addiction, and something that should be stopped. esport v sport is semantics Would you say people who played first-grade football before it became a professional sport were wasting their time because they didn't get paid (much)? If Kenny was top of SSBM now, as he was at his peak, he would be earning a lot of cash in prize money, as well as pretty lucrative sponsorships through gaming teams - which is only trending up. The whole 'he should have played a different game' seems to be a weak point. If somebody grows up playing Basketball they aren't going to drop it and try and be a quarterback for the $$, they'll stick to what they're good at and enjoy.   If you consider yourself to be an esports fan, yet still hold some of these views then its quite hard for public opinion to change. this is interesting if you want to see a more polished view on the topic"

survivor,3dwnjk,jenncantdance,24,Tue Jul 21 11:40:34 2015 UTC,"It tends to come up in confessionals, and cameramen generally watch those idol hotspots like hawks.  But there have been contestants who had to stage re-finding an idol on camera (Ralph, I think?) because the cameramen didn't catch it. Combine that with someone like Danni who hid her entire game from production and that definitely could end up happening.   Production would hate it, though, and the audience would be left thinking production just gave that contestant the idol."

survivor,3dx3hq,taffybeast,19,Mon Jul 20 06:44:01 2015 UTC,"Well, all of the examples you listed had lasting impacts on the season after the event, so they are all necessary inclusions for the season to make sense as a narrative.  Needless nastiness - such as Colton's confessionals and a lot of Dan moments - add very little to the show."
survivor,3dx3hq,xhakum,9,Mon Jul 20 06:48:28 2015 UTC,"Good point on my examples, but even with Colton and Dan's confessionals--why not introduce themes of racism or sexism if they represent the views and behaviors of the people involved? Is something being uncomfortable or difficult to watch so bad that we should go on thinking Dan Foley was progressive and aware, or that Colton and Alicia weren't blatantly bullying Christina? A lot of people complained about the dialogue between Jeff and Dan at the reunion, but when I was watching it I was absolutely intrigued, because it was such a real topic and their discussion seemed to be fairly unbiased (so I thought). Sure, it was uncomfortable, but aren't conflicts and tensions an important part of what makes Survivor thought-provoking? Where does the line get drawn?"
survivor,3dx3hq,TheAfricAsian,3,Mon Jul 20 06:56:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If that's how they are on the island, show it. Conflict is an important aspect of survivor and seeing different people that are forced to live together under extreme conditions greatly contributes to making this show so intriguing. It's tough though because now when I think of WA, Will and Dan are the first people that come to mind. I love moments like Ian and Katie arguing on the beach because it shows such raw emotion and the complex social dynamic of the game. But the Will moment just reminds me that people can be real shitty and while it can be thought provoking seeing no one but Mike say anything to stop Will, it doesn't make it any more fun to watch.  I think they can get around this by simply not casting shitty people. Cast villains all you like but don't cast someone that would compare a contestant to her special Ed students calling them ""dumb special"" y'know? I don't know if they knew Dan or especially Will would say those things, but if you have any incling they might be a bigot, don't cast them. Because while it may bring thought provoking moments, it won't make for a fun season. And why watch survivor if not to enjoy ourselves?"
survivor,3dx3hq,dmcarefuldriver,7,Mon Jul 20 11:14:26 2015 UTC,"As much as I want to say I like these kinds of incidents, overall I don't think they fit well with the show. I have no problem with semi-evil villians, but mentally unstable people or outright despicable people shouldn't be cast. I just watched the Ben vs. Jaison argument in Samoa, and as great as it was to see Jaison take down an arrogant racist so well, I'd rather the racist just not be cast in the first place. I'm not accusing the show of outright looking for that, but you have a white, entitled, southern boy who Probst praises afterwards for delivering what they wanted from him – they're clearly not upset about it."
survivor,3dx3hq,Todd_Solondz,6,Mon Jul 20 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"Grindgate and Yau/Dreamz were both good tv. I don't see a lot of people say that about grindgate, but half of the quotes any Ghandia enthusiast repeats are from grindgate, so idk about that. I thought it was interesting. Yau/Dreamz obviously was fantastic.  Rich/Sue sucked. Shirin/Will sucked for a different reason. It was clearly and unambiguously presented for the viewer to side with Shirin, which is fine. But I only tolerate bias and dishonesty in favour of a good story, and since Shirin just ended up going along with the rest of her alliance, that didn't happen. An honest portrayal would be much preferred to a set up with no good ending or story.  I think Ben/Jaison, Ian/Katie/Tom, Courtney/Jean-Robert, Penner/Adam/Candice etc all made for positive additions to their seasons for various reasons. There are probably more examples too.  So I guess I'd say if it's a good story, or if it's both significant and honest. Rich/Sue was doomed to be a crappy thing no matter what, but most other stuff I don't think had to be. I'm always, always in favour of more honesty in the show, or at least more balance."
survivor,3dx3hq,TheDemonicEmperor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"Imo, Shirin/Will had the best ending. She got the chance to return the favor at FTC and Will's comments against Shirin came back to haunt him and lost him a million dollars. Her ""dead fish"" comments wouldn't have made sense without the context behind her hatred for Will.  Plus, Shirin won by proxy when Captain America Mike destroyed the Axis of Evil."

survivor,3dx3hq,TheDemonicEmperor,5,Mon Jul 20 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"I think at the very least, they get people talking about the show, for better or worse.  But I think it's telling that Thailand, All-Stars, Fiji and Caramoan are considered bottom tier seasons by the general audience. (idk what fan reaction has been to Worlds Apart). Though that may have to do more with the fact that this kind of stuff only happens with a generally unlikable cast.  For me, it has to be a well-told story and add to the season. Truckgate and Auctiongate at least showed why exactly Dreamz and Will ultimately failed in their quest for the million. And they were forced to show why Brandon and Ghandia were booted as well as why Sue quit.  So, while I wasn't necessarily comfortable with these scenes, they were a necessary evil. Survivor can't always been sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes really ugly stuff happens out there and it's a disservice to just sweep it under the rug and not have it be the talking point of the season. (Though, tbh I think Worlds Apart laid it on a little thick but meh...)"
survivor,3dx3hq,TheNobullman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"It depends. If they're complex, well told and natural moments (Kathy's betrayal, Truckgate) then they're amazing amazing TV. If they're handled flatly, are just made ugly, or should never have happened because of bad manufacturing (Sue quits, Brandon's meltdown) then it's awful TV. There's little room for in between"
survivor,3dx3hq,TheCrimsonKnight,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"I like these moments. Although they might be in a negative light, they do reflect the true diverse human beings and give the viewer an insight into the complexity of the human nature. People do think and deal differently, and accordingly they do have difficulties in life. The players are real people with real emotions and real bodies that go through battling the nature physically and battling their emotions and trying to coexist with unpleasant people and circumstances. This show portrays all of that, and it does that with integrity. I appreciate what they are doing. Even with sensitive issues, they present them with care for the viewer. And that is hard to do."
survivor,3dx3hq,Sethowar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think its a casting problem more than anything, the first seasons had nowhere near the number of crazies we get at the moment, and like... why did they even bring colton out?

It shows people breaking down at times and shows how tough the game can really get.  Keep the show real I say."
survivor,3dx3hq,otherestScott,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"It's all in how it's presented. As soon as the show uses the event to perpetuate a certain narrative, or takes a certain side in the matter in one way or another then it becomes a bad thing. Also, if the show casts people purposely to generate these types of moments, that's also not good.  But if presented well then I will never argue about showing the ugly side of human existence, on this TV show or any other. It's risky, because it's so easy to get manipulative, but if it's done well it can be extremely compelling and interesting."

And while returning players are common now, at the time it really was pretty fun to see a mix of the biggest characters from the classic seasons.  And do you know what else? I think it's really sweet to watch Rob and Amber's relationship begin. At the time, everyone figured it was just a showmance, but considering that today they're married with four kids, ""Survivor: All-Stars"" is a unique document of two people meeting and really falling in love.

There's some fun moments I like, especially pre-merge - highlights are the Mixer challenge, Chapera's fake tribal, Touchy Subjects, and Richard Hatch.

survivor,3dwwsl,noah2461,16,Mon Jul 20 11:40:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely Thailand. I rank it #13 or so. It definitely isn't perfect - a lot of its biggest characters are ones I find entertaining because of or in spite of their negative traits, so if those flaws are too much for you it's not fun; the winner isn't easily likable; the game progresses in a predictable way; much of SJ are underedited; it's certainly a maaajor step backward after Marquesas which makes it frustrating to watch in order; I think it'd be hard to argue that it wasn't the worst of the first five. But I still really enjoy watching it most of the time: I think the F10/F9 episodes are one of the strongest back to back pairs ever, I think the various twists in the season are phenomenal, I love the creative challenges (which also kind of tie into twists, in that they broke a lot of previous precedents for challenges), the aesthetics are excellent, and it has a fair amount of characters I really, really like. It's not perfect, but I can't say I outright don't enjoy a season with the fake merge, its aftermath, Helen, Jan, Clay, Ghandia, Robb, Jake, and Shii Ann. It's not everyone's cup of tea and I get that, but I have a good time watching it.  And this is even with me hating absolutely everything about Brian Heidik. If I found him compelling, Thailand could be in my top ten. But it still stands as a strong season in spite of him, for me."

Not saying its a good thing that happened but she made a strong point about how the contestants are real humans and not just reality characters.   -Richard Hatch being a beast with biting a shark and saying I've been bamboozled when voted out.   -Rupert getting wasted on reward while everyone else watches him uncomfortably.   -Jeff Tells Rob he's taking shotgun putting Amber in the backseat of the car. Cheeky Mate.  Finally, the season does not play out well (plays out okay if you're BR fan) but I really enjoy a lot of the micro things that happened in ASS. Not top tier for me but higher up than the others listed."

survivor,3dwwsl,MrUnderdawg,3,Mon Jul 20 07:03:40 2015 UTC,"South Pacific, Thailand, and All-Stars all have redeeming qualities.   Thailand had an interesting cultural scaffolding, some good twists, and a very solid winner who also doubled as a human oil slick. South Pacific has one of my favorite winners and a couple reasonable characters otherwise. All-Stars is certainly darker, but it was an interesting experiment in bringing back people back from when the cast was a lot closer.  Of those three, Thailand is probably the best of them, but I do have a small soft spot for South Pacific because of Sophie.  [Also, shouldn't Fiji, Cook Islands, and arguably Samoa be on the list you posted at first?]"
survivor,3dwwsl,acktar,2,Mon Jul 20 10:21:34 2015 UTC,"This is fair--I would give SoPa redeeming qualities in that Sophie was a badass and underrated winner. She just didn't get half the attention she deserved in the edit.  Absolutely redeeming qualities to Thailand and All-Stars. I fully agree with Fiji and Cook Islands. The Russell over-editing in Samoa is abysmal, but I recently re-watched and there's enough that shines through from under-edited characters (Laura M more than anyone) that you can see the material for a great season is there. They just chose to do a season fellating Russell instead."

All Star is really not that bad if you watch it in a vacuum (without knowing who the players were).Both SoPa and One World have great winner, and for me it salvage them from being consider among the worst seasons.

Mike talking about how desperately he needs the advantage, the dramatic music building up with a montage of people winning amazing over-the-top items (Jenn getting an enormous Martini was perfect), all leading to Mike's dramatic betrayal, all before the intro even plays. It's something you would expect from a fully scripted, well produced TV-series. It's one of my favorite Survivor scenes."
survivor,3dvlv2,FritoDoritos,8,Mon Jul 20 00:13:00 2015 UTC,It's my favorite clip show of an auction for sure

I also remember when I was watching it for the first time you have that really odd sense that something isnt quite right, you hear Dan telling mike to go then mike saying ""oh yeah ill go"" , and then Dan rambling on about how much he loves he wife while the music in the background really doesn't scream heartwarming then BAM it suddenly hits like a brick wall"

Anything more then just tuning in at 8 on Wednesday can qualify you a bit.  But, I think there is a discrepancy in the intelligence of ""super fans."" Namely, I would consider a lot of the people to post here superfans, but I would not consider them well versed in the game. For instance, if you think that there is a ""problem with a bitter jury,""; even if you read and post on /r/Survivor all the time, and watch every episode, if you have an opinion so fundamentally wrong like that, I don't consider you really that smart of a fan, and I question how ""super"" you really are."

While I think being able to name all of those thing does make you a super fan, I don't think it's necessary. I think it's more important to understand the concepts and strategies of the game and to be able to recognize when those techniques should and shouldn't be played. I know Max made that statement at on TC about all of the power being on one tribe after the shuffle. While it's impressive to know that I fail to see how I helped him in his game. I think it'd be more important to know that the other tribe is going to keep winning immunity, how does he need to adapt his strategy? I suppose having a precedent to follow would help, but the names aren't as important as the idea.  Just my two cents, down vote me to oblivion for having a different opinion."

survivor,3dxrby,joshj516,5,Mon Jul 20 15:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think HvV enhanced his legacy, honestly. It made him a more complex and dynamic character. He was kind of a relic of earlier Survivor in that season, and yeah he didn't go far, but part of that is just pre-game stuff - and he still managed to adapt to new Survivor by actually Idoling out a major threat. I think it was a surreal and really cool little storyline.

It also has to do with the tone/quality of the edit and whether you were left thinking either: (1) they got a raw deal, (2) they had a lot left to give, or (3) you were simply sad to see them go because they were so damn entertaining.   For me, not only was Tom out early but I remember thinking, ""meh, seems about right.""  For the other people you mentioned, Tyson, Penner, Coach - they are all exceptional personalities that got great airtime and great confessionals. Penner's injury was a raw deal, Tyson was in the prime of his game, and Coach ... well he's Coach.   I agree that Tina's the best example of an early boot with an unmemorable edit who got to come back. Maybe they were struggling to fill spots because of the nature of a BvW season."

So, although it's hard or impossible to know, Courtney was probably playing it up, and mentioned the shoulder specifically because she was impressed Stephanie went back for another round.

survivor,3dv6uv,codyhupp21,22,Sun Jul 19 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"If we include the similar twist from Worlds Apart, the results tell a lot. Of the three cases where the clue was taken (Garrett, Morgan, and Joaquin/So), only one person actually found the idol (Garrett), and only one person made the merge (Morgan). All 4 were quickly distrusted and became targets very early on, and the one who found the idol didn't even save himself with it.  In the three cases where the extra food was taken (Trish, Will/Jenn, Dan/Mike), everyone involved made the merge, and in two cases in Worlds Apart, someone from both groups still found their tribe's idol. In both Cagayan and Worlds Apart, the pre-merge tribe that won most challenges had the extra food (Appari and Escameca), indicating that it seems to be legitimately useful.   Aside from all that, there's one particular reason choosing the extra good is smarter. I know I'll get crucified for quoting Dan, but he was the only one who correctly stated that reason. ""It's too early in the game to lie."" The key to getting far in Survivor is to make good relationships with the people on your tribe. If the first impression you make is of you being untrustworthy, you will never have a good relationship with your tribe. Picking the idol clue is a classic example of playing too hard too early."
survivor,3dv6uv,FritoDoritos,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that, IIRC, the note they got said something along the lines of ""help yourself with an idol clue, or help your tribe with rice."" This implies that helping your tribe isn't selfish, which is misleading since as your comment demonstrates, winning more challenges can be as beneficial if not more important than having an idol clue."

A clue to an idol may (or may not) result in you being saved for 3 more days; extra food will allow your team to win challenges and make a good first impression which could set you up to last waaay longer.  Also, if you get the idol on Day 1 there's a good chance you'll be found out - using Cagayan as an example, the other Luzon members (or at the very least Kass) were able to figure out that Garrett had the idol and it cost him."
survivor,3dv6uv,nerdiestgriffinever,13,Sun Jul 19 20:17:10 2015 UTC,It was my understanding that nobody else on the island knew garret had the idol. I think garret said that in his exit interview. Kass on the other hand claimed to 'hunch' once she saw the episode lol

survivor,3dv6uv,GreatCott,2,Sun Jul 19 20:21:46 2015 UTC,Take the food.  It's very possible to find the idol without a clue to the idol is no guarantee you will find the idol.  Just look at what happened in Worlds Apart.  Plus the risk of making yourself a target.  Even if you are able to take the clue and get the idol with anyone one your tribe finding out people on the other tri e will likely know about it and could out you at a swap or merge.  It's just too risk plus the food can help keep you sharp and better able to complete in challenges.
survivor,3dv6uv,PadishahEmperor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:03 2015 UTC,It depends who you are. If i was Garrett i would take the food because i am a huge dude and i won't be voted out early anyway. If I was Kass though i might need the idol early so it could be worth it.
survivor,3dv6uv,GreatCott,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:59 2015 UTC,The extra bag of beans and rice then take off to find the idol. If you've seen the show then it should be easier for you to find the idol without a clue. Thats my take at least. If your tribe comes walking up like Morgans just be like oh I was scouting out the beach but look I got an option between this and this. I choose the one that would benefit all of us. It would probably take some heat off you.

Things seem to be forgotten very easily on the island, I don't think anyone would think about it much after the merge. Only since you're asking during Cagayan. Now because the twist is predictable and been done before the circumstances are different. Like So in Worlds Apart. Her choice and poor lying skills played apart in her downfall."
survivor,3dv6uv,yehhey,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"Things seem to be forgotten very easily on the island.   I'm willing to bet it's the exact opposite. It's been said countless times that there is an endless amount of free time, and I would imagine that gives a lot of time to analyze these types of moments. The only reason it seemed forgotten by the merge was because its effects had already set in by then. Trish was the most trusted person in her alliance, Garrett was already voted out, and Morgan was more or less isolated apart from being in a basic majority alliance.   The problem with choosing the idol clue, even in Cagayan, is that the effects of doing so were too damaging for too little reward. An idol isn't that enormous of an advantage when everyone is against you (see: Jenn and Mike)."

All-Stars: Tina, Hatch, Colby and Ethan all went early, Tom was the only person to make top 5 twice. The winner, Amber was barely remembered from Australia. She was mostly on for aesthetic purposes. Micronesia: Yau-Man was probably the best player to be cast (with Fairplay who basically quit) and he was taken out pre-swap. Ozzy was also a fairly good player and was taken out early jury. Outside of Cirie and Amanda, most people didn't play both games well. Parvati was only mildly popular from CI and not considered a theat. Heroes vs Villains: Tom and Cirie went very early. JT was taken out early jury. Parvati would have been taken out pre-jury, but then Tyson. Sandra was overshadowed somewhat on her first season by bigger characters like Rupert and Fairplay. She was also not considered a threat physically. Caramoan: This season might be the exception, because no one really played a great game prior to returning. Blood vs Water: Tyson was basically remembered as a character that made one of the dumbest moves ever.

Besides, who played better than him that was an Malakal, other than Cirie, Ozzy and JFP? Besides, it's about the cast overrating him as a threat as he was given a very generous edit."
survivor,3duqqg,WilburDes,5,Mon Jul 20 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"I would probably agree with him being the best after Cirie, Ozzy and Fairplay (though I'd possibly have a toss-up of Yau vs. ChinAmanda or Ami).   I would say you're right, though, that Yau was the biggest target in the cast, because his edit was so overwhelming and recent."

survivor,3duqqg,trinitymonkey,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"...Sandra, a former winner known for being the most foul-mouthed mother on television, was forgettable?  I realize she got zero screen time on HvV, but she was a huge character during PI. And she had already won!"
survivor,3duqqg,destinystepchild,20,Sun Jul 19 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"She was, at best, the 3rd most memorable character on a six-year old season. She was a huge character, yeah, but she was also upstaged by two of the most famous characters in Survivor history (Fairplay and Rupert). She was about as memorable to casual and new fans as Todd is to facebook casuals. I'm not trying to be blasphemous, I love Sandra, but it's not too hard to see how she could slip under the radar."
survivor,3duqqg,trinitymonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"That's fair. But she wasn't exactly playing against Facebook casuals. I think if anything, she slipped by not because no one noticed her, but because nobody thought she could win twice.  And it was a six-year-old season that everybody loves. Sandra, Fairplay, and Rupert are all arguably bigger characters than anybody in the entire cast of Thailand, Africa, even Marquesas... and a boatload of the post-ASS seasons."
survivor,3duqqg,destinystepchild,9,Sun Jul 19 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe she's not forgettable compared to the average Survivor contestant, but when's she's surrounded by Boston Rob, Parvati, Coach, Russell, Courtney, Tyson, JT, Rupert, Amanda, Cirie, and Colby, she becomes forgettable.  Big, memorable personalities always clash in all star seasons and the Sandra, Amber, Sherri and Monica C.'s of the world slip by to the end."
survivor,3duqqg,NinjApheX,2,Sun Jul 19 22:10:21 2015 UTC,"...Amanda Kimmel has a bigger, more memorable personality than Sandra Diaz-Twine?  And honestly, I love her, but was Courtney any more visible at all than Sandra during HvV? I felt like they practically got the same edit.  And, sure, but other finalists in returning player seasons were--just going from the ones you listed--Parvati, Rob, Coach, Russell, Tyson, Amanda, and Cirie. Rob and Tyson WON their respective returning player seasons where they were widely known as threats. Sherri was a noob and an obvious goat, and um, Monica got a single vote to stick it to Gervase. Amber beat her fiance by one vote. Sandra won 6-3-0. Apples to oranges."
survivor,3duqqg,destinystepchild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:34:50 2015 UTC,Parv played very differently than Sandra and Amber. In both of her returning seasons she was a target for first boot because she's such a threat. I don't see how you'd consider the head of the black widow brigade playing under the radar.
survivor,3duqqg,UnawareItsaJoke,3,Sun Jul 19 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"The head of the Black Widow Brigade was Cirie. Parvati was rarely the face of the strategic plays, she was out making friends with the jury as they left because that's what she does best."

survivor,3duqqg,Shutupredneckman2,4,Sun Jul 19 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"Are you watching the same seasons as me? Parv was a challenge beast, she's one of the only women to be able to win 6 individual immunities. According to JFP, had he stayed she would have been the first boot target. In HvV she was the target right after Randy, so technically they wanted her out second. People are way underestimating the physical nature of her immunity game and the charm of her social game."
survivor,3duqqg,UnawareItsaJoke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:56 2015 UTC,"Parv was a challenge beast, she's one of the only women to be able to win 6 individual immunities.

survivor,3duqqg,WilburDes,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:29 2015 UTC,It's pretty tough to win individual immunity consistently when you're playing against Ozzy in 2 of your seasons.
survivor,3duqqg,nightkitchen,0,Mon Jul 20 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"Parv has won 4 individual immunity challenges, and 0 when Micronesia started. Even with her 4 wins, she's still weaker than Amanda (who also has 4), James and Ozzy. She would have been first boot, but because 6 is more than 4, Yau was immune, and Parv was the weakest of those 4.  She was in the majority alliance in HvV and then between her 1st and 2nd TCs, she and Russell split up their alliance because they couldn't play nice with Rob, and then she became a target."

However I think Kelley has a better chance. She was a smaller part of her season and was taken out at the swap. She is essentially ""untested"". We didn't really see what she is capable of. I think Kelley has the most potential to surprise the other players as well as the fans.   As for can they win?  Sure. Everyone on the cast is a hardcore and dedicated player. The jury will respect big moves and strategic  play.  At some point, even the most UTR player will have to prove that they were a game changer to win the vote."

Russell's ego gets in his way, voting off Danielle was DUMB because it alienated Parvati a little away from him.  I also don't think that Russell got JT blindsided, it was Parvati with ther double idol play.  Russell stabbed both Danielle and Jerri in the back.  He also has said awful assholey things that we never got to see (I believe Jerri has said he says stuff that never made the air)  And remember, that even when Amanda got voted off in Ponderosa you could see that even by that point the Jury hated him."

They didn't realize (or straight up didn't care) that all the Heroes participated in writing that letter (Amanda, Candice, Colby, Rupert).  While it was funny and it basically tanked the game for all the Heroes, it's not smart to make fun of somebody who are going to decide who wins or not."

survivor,3dv60v,PopsicleIncorporated,12,Sun Jul 19 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"The point of Survivor is to win over a jury. It isn't to make big moves. If the Jury hates you, then you've failed at the point of the entire game.  There is no argument as towards Russell playing a better game, because he played excellently at a part that didn't even matter, and failed miserably at a part that did."
survivor,3dv60v,willwithskills,18,Sun Jul 19 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"Here's an example of how much of an asshole Russell is for no apparent reason. You can see him make certain promises to Coach, and Coach gives him  a cross necklace and they swear on it together during the premerge. Then Russell boots him cuz lol why not.  Later, for God only knows what reason, Rusell decides to promise Rupert final 3 somewhere around F6 or maybe F7. He used the cross necklace, given by Coach before he was voted out, to make this pledge to Rupert. Rupert then took this necklace to Ponderosa when he was ousted by Russell. One can imagine how Coach and Rupert felt about all that once it was revealed.  This isn't just any-means-necessary strategy. It's being a lying dickbag in a way that doesn't even benefit your position in the game. Hence, terrible player."
survivor,3dv60v,mygoodnessjoshua,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:37 2015 UTC,Agree. The comments he makes to Rupert at the fire after Candace goes (I think) are so unnecessary. I don't even like Rupert. But if russell was a good player he'd know there is no point speaking like that to an obvious jury vote. He is convinced he will get votes in the final 3 but you can tell he is completely oblivious that all the social shit comes back to bite.

survivor,3dv60v,feline_crusader,7,Mon Jul 20 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"It was foolish to assume that Russell was not in an alliance with the girls.   That's not a reason to give any credit to Russell, that's a reason to take away credit from JT.   Breaking up Danielle alliance was smart.   Even if we assume this is true (which I certainly don't), his execution was abominable. Look at how Jerri handled the situation, and then look at how Russell handled it, and then think about what the Jury might have been thinking at that point.   Why did he not get a single vote?   Frankly, because everyone hated him. You don't get to act like an asshole to everyone you meet for 39 days and then demand that they give you a million dollars - people don't work that way. He also screwed up Final Tribal Council pretty badly - Colby and Jerri were planning on voting for him but he couldn't stop being an egomaniac for two seconds even during his opening speech, so they switched.  It's also worth noting that the reason why he got past Final 6 was because everyone knew they could beat him in the end."

In HvV and his other seasons. We see this in how he treats every single Hero and ESPECIALLY how he treats Danielle on her way out.

survivor,3dv60v,TheNobullman,6,Sun Jul 19 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the opinion of those who think that Russell deserved to win isn't justified because he didn't deserve to win. The whole point of the jury is to give the most deserving player a million dollars. There is no set criteria. It's not 'vote whoever made the most blindsides and idol plays'. Russell wasn't seen as the best by the jury so he wasn't. Sandra was. The jury is right."
survivor,3dv60v,Shutupredneckman2,5,Sun Jul 19 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"Taking out Danielle was one of the Top 5 dumbest moves in Survivor history.  He voted out someone he actually had a chance of beating at the FTC who was totally and completely loyal to him because he wanted to split up an alliance that he was in.  After that and the Candice vote-off, he didn't leave anyone he could beat at the FTC.  Rupert, Colby, and Sandra all had tons of friends and allies on the jury, and Parvati and Jerri were respected by the jury, which Russell failed to acheive because he literally made his closest allies cry.  He personally insulted and pissed off every single jury member on the way out the door.  If you believe Russell played the best game in HvV, you do not understand that Suvivor is a social game with strategic aspects, not the other way around.  Russell played the worst game in HvV."

survivor,3dv60v,ohashibiles,7,Sun Jul 19 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"It's hard to separate them because they're exact same thing, though. Strategy is a plan of action undertaken to achieve a goal, and the goal is winning Survivor, which requires having the jury's support. Ergo the strategy of Survivor is the same thing people call ""the social game"": getting people to like you while maneuvering through them. Russell's strategy was terrible because he made it so he'd never have the jury's support, would never win the game, and therefore would never achieve the goal."
survivor,3dv60v,ohashibiles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"I think the best way to separate it is the strategic game involves the moving of blank pieces in the game while the social game is your ability to get those pieces on your side both before and after their vote out. Russell was great at having the pieces he needed strategically to move forward, but pissed on his pieces socially out the way out the door and that's why he lost.   I remember watching survivor causally (rarely missed an episode except during RI) until Phillipines and I remember how robbed I thought Russell was in both seasons. (I know causal as fuck.)  I've rewatched both since then and it's absolutely crazy to think how blind some people are (and how i used to be) to the intricacies of the game and the interconnections between the strategy and the social aspects."

Survivor is a social game and the only strategy in a social game involves maneuvering where you stand in the social pecking order. I don't think moving pieces is anything but social because humans are the only game pieces. If there were more tools/pawns besides the idols and immunity necklace then maybe, but even those tools just give you a free pass from being the bottom of the hierarchy and move you one spot up, hence are inherently social."
survivor,3dv60v,EL_Gordoz,2,Mon Jul 20 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"Survivor is a social game.  Good social allows you to make moves and gain allies.  Good strategic play is knowing what moves to make and when to make them, including idols and reacting to the game twists.    Because of Russell's social play in HvV, he lost respect exactly 19 times from the people he played with which lead to his goat-like status.  He played an aggressive strategic game which further alienated players. I don't think his game should be hated, but his logic and understanding of Survivor is obviously misguided."

Had Parvati tried to tell Jerri that Russell was voting for her, Jerri either wouldn't have believed her or would have confronted Russell, at which point Russell probably would have switched to voting out Parvati. Parvati was playing for a F3 with Danielle and Russell, which she would have won. She was then playing for a F3 with Jerri and Russell, which she might have won. Unfortunately, she allied herself with someone who didn't understand the game, and you cannot really blame her because no one else was even willing to talk to her, much less align with her. I think Parvati played a heckuva game in HvV given the size of the target on her back."
survivor,3dwqq4,mboyle1988,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, yes and no. I'm not going to blame her for Russell voting out Danielle, but she did go pretty clearly out of her way the previous episodes to antagonize him and keep him in the dark by hiding things from him and increasing his paranoia for no real reason other than to make herself look like a better player on TV. So it's not completely her fault Russell went insane and tried to make a power move on her, cause one of his main rationales for doing that was because Parvati was all giggly and schemey about how much power she had over him.  As far as the F3 goes, I get what you're saying, but it still doesn't really add up to me. If she knows she can't beat Sandra and maybe can beat Jerri, then she has to try to get Jerri to vote out Sandra with her even if she's scared it's going to get her voted out in 4th. Like, if she's such a good player can't she convince Jerri? Since what she was saying was the truth and everything? Even if she has a 20% chance of convincing Jerri, she should risk that instead of just accepting 2nd place to Sandra. She's still accepting going into a F3 she can't win. A 20% chance of winning and an 80% chance of getting fourth is better than an 100% chance of getting second in my book since the goal is to win and everything.   Parvati's HvV game is fine, even good. It's definitely not among the best non-winning games ever. I don't completely buy the ""everyone wanted her gone sooooo bad"" stuff, since that's contradicted by practically every post-game interview where the other villains say Parvati was part of the majority alliance with the other day 39ers from the start and alienated herself by going off with Russell and Danielle."

Certainly, on the show, we didn't hear anyone else mentioned as such a threat from the get go as Parvati."
survivor,3dwqq4,mboyle1988,0,Tue Jul 21 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Right from the beginning, we ended up not losing a lot, so we had all of these shifting alliances. It was like a lava lamp, you know? Things bubble and it keeps changing shapes. It started off with Rob and Russell and Sandra, Parvati and Danielle. But Rob and Russell have two wildly different ideas of how to play ""Survivor"" and what's important in that game, so they started bumping heads and then there was nowhere to let pressure out. While that was happening, Danielle wanted to be with Rob, but Rob couldn't stand her, so she sort of slunk off into a corner. Then Russell had time only for Parvati and he wouldn't even talk to anyone else, so they ending up factioning off. Then Tyson and I ended up palling around. Then Tyson came over with Rob and us and he brought Coach and Jerri and so it turned into 6 vs. 3 instead of 3 vs. 3 vs. 3 and then targeted Tyson and he left and then the whole thing splintered.  (And for good measure, Russell describing his attempt to play the game like Natalie White, and how it was so difficult he literally could not keep it up for more than a week or so. But she's an undeserving winner, y'all.)  I was gonna go behind Boston Rob and be the one that he thinks he can trust, trying to act like Natalie was to me. I know it might have looked funny, but I was gonna try and do it. But then I couldn't. My personality would not allow it, because Rob's personality was just as strong as mine and he was bossing everybody around, telling everyone what to eat, what time to eat, what time they can friggin' got take a leak in the woods. And I just couldn't deal with it no more. I'm in control of everything I do. And in the game? You know my job? Everything. So I was like, ""You know what? I've gotta take control in this game, cuz if I don't, I'm goin' home."" I couldn't do it."

She had no chance of winning HvV once Danielle left, and she had no chance of winning the Micro F3 she was playing for. It was between Cirie and Amanda for the money. If you have no chance of winning, you are a goat by definition. She was twice.   If you think Parvati ""slayed"" in Micro or HvV and is a top ten winner... well, sorry. She played terribly in both. CI is her best performance and even that I'd rate like 4/10."
survivor,3dwqq4,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"I enjoy that you call CI her best performance when it's objectively her worst.  If you come in first in a race, you ran the best individual race. Period. If you come in second, you ran the second best. Because players and jurors can both vote based on whatever the hell they want, the only metric of success that's valid IMO is how far someone goes. Russell played a worse overall game than Sandra and Parvati because he didn't get as far as they did. Their social games were simply better. Luck can factor into play, but the same is true of a race or any other athletic event.  My favorite, though, is ""If you have no chance of winning, you are a goat by definition."" Sure. She literally won Micronesia, so I would say she had a shot at winning. Yes, the twist screwed over Cirie, and yes, Parv probably loses without it. But luck is part of the game too, and your success is measured in the game that you play, not the game that you could have ended up playing. (I.E. Yes, if there had been a final three, it might have gone differently, but that's irrelevant because there wasn't one. To quote Colby, ""If if's and but's were candy and nuts, we'd all have a very merry Christmas."")"
survivor,3dwqq4,destinystepchild,0,Mon Jul 20 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"It is not objectively her worst. The point of the game is to win. She could have won CI if she made the end. She could not win HvV and she could not win Micro in her planned F3.  Not sure what you're trying to prove with the race thing since that's my entire point. Parvati played such that she would lose to most everyone in the race. She outright lost the race in Micro but then Production dropped a torch in front of Cirie and Parv was able to run past her.  Yeah I get this argument a lot and it honestly just has no basis in reason. She won because of a twist she had nothing to do with. Her agency is what led to her having 0 chance in a final 3 scenario. Luck is part of the game but that doesn't mean that the best player/winner is decided by the luck of what endgame format Production decides to use. If they did it in Fiji and Earl was out in 3rd, is Cassandra suddenly deserving of winning? Obviously not. Measuring success based on the game they play is my whole point, and Parvati played a 2nd/3rd place game in Micro."
survivor,3dwqq4,Shutupredneckman2,0,Mon Jul 20 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"...but Parvati won Micronesia. She lost CI. You're actually saying because she could have won CI if things had gone completely differently, that's a stronger game than the one in which she did win when things went the way they did in reality? Seriously?  Yep, Parvati played a 2nd or 3rd place game if Micronesia had been an entirely different game. She played a 1st place game based on the way Micronesia played out in real life. The ""if there had been a final three, she would have lost!"" argument is historical fiction, because there wasn't a final three and she didn't lose."
survivor,3dwqq4,destinystepchild,2,Mon Jul 20 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"Dude, how do you not understand this logic. Based on the game she was playing in Micro, she would be in a final 3 where she lost. Parv has ZERO agency in it becoming a final 2. If at the end of Worlds Apart, Probst had come into camp and killed Mike with a machete, Carolyn would have won, and that would be how ""things played out in reality"", but that doesn't change that Mike played the best.   If you're playing basketball and you shoot on your own hoop, but the ball bounces off miraculously and lands across the court in the correct hoop, you are not suddenly a good basketball player."
survivor,3dwqq4,Shutupredneckman2,0,Mon Jul 20 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"Lol, you're saying her sixth place finish is a better game than her first place finish and her second face finish, so I wouldn't wag your finger in my face about logic.  Who gives a fuck? Ozzy and Yul have zero agency in it being a final three. Earl has zero agency in it being a final three. J.T. has zero agency in it being a final two. ALL the players have zero agency in the twists that come their way.  Honestly, I would say it changes that Mike didn't play the best overall game. (And let's be honest, he didn't play a phenomenal game--he relied on a challenge winning streak, and if we're playing counterfactuals, he loses if he loses any of those immunities.) Could he still be the best overall player? Sure. But if he doesn't come in first, he didn't play the best overall game. You're not a good basketball player if you win a game by accident, but you played the better game if you won."
survivor,3dwqq4,destinystepchild,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"Because she better maximized her chances of winning CI than Micro, which is the object.  No one has agency in twists, but if everyone is playing for one outcome and Production is also planning that same outcome, but then changes the format right near the end of the game, it doesn't alter who played the best game.   How would Probst killing Mike with a machete change that he played the best game?! That's clearly bizarre.   But you've arrived almost at my point. You're not good if you win by accident. Parvati won Micro by accident."

In Micro, she was going to a final 3 where she'd have no chance of winning, and where it would be between the other 2 people for the million. That's a goat."
survivor,3dwqq4,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"So you're saying because she would not have won her season if the twists had been different, her win is irrelevant?  Doesn't that invalidate half the winners? If Silas doesn't get screwed by the tribe swap, Ethan doesn't necessarily win Africa. If the Outcasts don't come back, Sandra doesn't necessarily win PI. If there's no final three but a final two, Yul doesn't necessarily win CI and Earl doesn't necessarily win Fiji. (In fact, I think they both lose.)  You don't get to play the game you want, you get to play the game you have. I'm not even a Parvati fan--I wanted Cirie to win Micronesia and Sandra to win HvV--but she literally won the game. She might not have won if they had had a final three, but she might have won anyway if they decided to expand to a final four. Anything in the game could have been structured differently and it's absurd to base judgments off of counterfactuals like ""Well, she was going to lose, but then she only won because the rules of the game were not what everyone assumed they were."" She only won because she performed the best in the structure of the season that actually played out."
survivor,3dwqq4,destinystepchild,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:11 2015 UTC,"""doesn't necessarily"" is kind of the issue there. Silas getting swapped out and Outcasts are things that happened early in the season that Ethan and Sandra had to adapt to (and for what it's worth, Silas was done regardless so I don't think that matters much to Ethan's win). Earl and co. were more or less planning for an F3 and I think he'd be fine if it swapped to an F2 because he could boot Cassandra in 4th and Yau in 3rd. Yul is a good one, though. I generally rank him 29 for winners just above Parvati because of all of his crazy twists.  At any rate, the point is those winners were not handed the win by twists, Yul aside, and could still have won their seasons. Parvati literally could not mathematically win her season without the twist. It was completely instrumental in her winning. And also the whole ""would have been first boot if Fairplay wasn't injured"" thing, and the ""would have been first boot post-swap if Penner and Kathy weren't evacked"" thing.   It's not absurd at all because the entire cast was playing for a final 3 based on having seen the past seasons, and Production was planning for a final 3 as is clearly visible in the jury starting at 10. Parvati wasn't playing for a final 2, or she'd at least be a little impressive. She was playing for a 3 where she'd lose. Production's random decision to change the endgame midstream doesn't alter who the best player is."

Sure, every winner has had luck and so on. But most are generally lucky that the plan they made to win worked. Parvati is just lucky that her plan didn't work.   And then she basically goes onto prove that she's a glorified pre-merge boot/FTC goat by almost going pre-merge again in HvV and then being saved through another stroke of great luck outside of her control (Russell giving her the idol and Tyson being dumb) but this time, a surprise final 2 didn't bail her out.  And this has nothing to do with liking or disliking Parvati. Which people like to claim.  EDIT: Also, a lot of criticisms of Parvati as a player come from the fact that she was ludicrously voted as the best player of all time in that RHAP and tops (or gets close to) a lot of personal lists. Which, cool she formed an alliance with Alexis and Natalie and then Russell gave her an idol  in HvV so she got to make it to the FTC and lose.

I'm stating a simple fact. An opinion cannot be something that is objectively right or objectively wrong, and OP's statement that Natalie is an ""incorrect winner"" is objectively wrong."
survivor,3dztd9,Shutupredneckman2,0,Tue Jul 21 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the definition of the ""correct winner"" is objectively the person left standing at FTC with the most votes from the jury. Period. Natalie might not have been the person he/she had voted for had he/she been on the jury, but calling Natalie the incorrect winner is the equivalent of calling any sports team who accumulates the most points under the rules to win the ""incorrect winner."" The correct winner is just the person who meets the requirements to win, and that's not a matter of opinion when the requirements are an objective metric like a number of votes.  Literally, the only way someone could be the ""incorrect winner"" of Survivor is if there was a mistake made by production--say, an incorrect count of the votes. It's a game with straightforward rules. The person with the most votes against them goes home every week until 2-3 are left, and then the person who gets the most votes from the jury wins. As long as that happens, you inherently end up with a correct winner."
survivor,3dztd9,destinystepchild,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"there are a few other ways there could be an incorrect winner. or at least raise doubt about the correctness of the winner. (none of which have likely happened)       a incorrect judgement call that determines the winner of a challenge. it is possible for the correct winner to be unfairly eliminated after winning a challenge. (this would likely not happen as few challenges are so close and there would likely be enough time between the challenge and the vote to reverse the call)      an uncaught rules violation. if someone won in part due to offering to split the prize, they would not be the correct winner in my mind.      physically injuring a contender so that they have to be pulled from the game.     now all of these are unlikely to happen because they are constantly on camera, but all could produce an incorrect winner.     or what about jeff mistakenly accepting a fake immunity idol"

survivor,3dteot,destinystepchild,16,Sun Jul 19 09:52:58 2015 UTC,Can you tell us a bit more actually? Since their are commercial breaks and stuff. Like stuff we didn't see or the overall vibe.
survivor,3dteot,EL_Gordoz,13,Sun Jul 19 14:11:27 2015 UTC,"Sure! I was 14, friend of a friend of a friend worked for CBS and had two extra finale tickets. Somebody in the chain knew I was a Survivor superfan (aka huge dork for Survivor) and got them to me.  The whole audience watched the first two hours of the finale live as it aired. It REALLY built up the atmosphere for the reunion itself--it was like watching the Super Bowl. The crowd would react thunderously to every challenge, every good line, and every vote. In particular, ""Don't be stupid, stupid!"" brought down the house, and Alicia's vote for Amber (""Remember when I said I'd never write your name down? I'm a woman of my word."") got a HUGE reaction... Half laughter and applause, half the ""OOOOOOOH!"" sound the kids in a classroom make when one of them gets in trouble.  Rupert was overwhelmingly the most popular among the audience and no one seemed to want anyone else to win after he was voted off. I wasn't a big fan of any of the four and was half-heartedly rooting for Amber. I'd say she was probably the most popular once Rupert was out, but 90% of the crowd was there for him. Nobody seemed to care either way about Jenna and I think the audience was more anti-Rob than pro-Amber.  One or two commercial breaks before the reunion started, they brought the cast out to start seating them, and people went absolutely nuts. They kept the lights off so we couldn't see them, but the atmosphere was electric. The momentum just kept building up so by the time the reunion itself started, you had a crowd ready to go wild at the drop of a hat, as you saw with the Jerri booing. Everybody went crazy at the proposal, even though I imagine it seemed bland and contrived on TV.  Russ Landau and the Survivor band played during breaks. Not a lot else you didn't see--nothing really happened during the commercial breaks that I can remember other than some mild small talk from Jeff to the audience.  Sorry I don't remember everything more clearly--it's been a while since then, haha. But if any of you have questions, happy to answer them."

survivor,3dteot,Shutupredneckman2,4,Sun Jul 19 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"I was not! At the time, honestly, it was very confusing. The booing started and before long, she was just gone. It was in a relatively small venue (The Theater at Madison Square Garden, maybe 4000 people), so it was easy to see everything onstage, and yet it still wasn't totally clear what was going on. I believe Jeff had to explain it to us, either on a break or as he explained to the at-home audience.  I do remember the booing being overwhelming. The whole thing had a very raucous atmosphere--we watched the full finale leading up to the reunion, and people were hooting and hollering for their favorites the whole time and booing their least favorites. I was maybe 14 when I went, though, so my memory is not phenomenally extensive."

Like I said above, I think I was 14, so I don't remember everything, but happy to answer any questions you guys have. Also went to the after-party and met probably 1/3 of the All-Stars cast plus  a bunch of other random contestants.  All-Stars I met: Amber, Jenna, Rupert, Shii Ann, Ethan, Richard, Rudy. Amber was totally overwhelmed being mobbed by fans and press but still took pictures with fans and was very sweet. Rob was a tremendous asshole and basically ignored anyone without a professional camera or microphone. Everyone else was great. Shii Ann was probably my favorite contestant so was most excited to meet her, but Jenna Lewis was easily the nicest person there. (And gorgeous in person.) Richard was also very cool and funny.  Others I met: Elisabeth, Vecepia, Brian Heidik, Tanya Vance, Sandra, Fairplay, and Trish Dunn. Maybe a few others I'm forgetting; I have pictures somewhere I should dig up. Elisabeth was easily the most famous person there but was so patient and nice. And stunning. Don't think she'd gone fully off the rails yet. Vecepia was very nice too, as was Tanya. Sandra was probably the best person I met all night--she was (and is) my favorite contestant ever, spent a while talking to 14-year-old me, and literally pushed people out of the way so I could get to Ethan. She could get loud too, WTF!  I also met Jonny Fairplay's grandmother, who appeared to be his date. I also snagged a picture with Julie Chen as she was getting into her limo. (She is incredibly beautiful.) Les Moonves yelled at her to hurry up and she ignored him. Chenbot FTW.  So yeah, if you have questions about any of that, hit me!"

survivor,3dteot,destinystepchild,15,Mon Jul 20 02:54:32 2015 UTC,Lol Jerri was much more popular with the crowd at the HvV reunion.
survivor,3dteot,Ser-Jorah-Mormont,11,Sun Jul 19 09:19:28 2015 UTC,I remember Jerri leaving it I think it kind of made the rest of the reunion episode awkward at least for me. Also watching you could tell how much tension there was between most of the contestants which was another thing that made it sort of awkward. Back to the Jerri thing though I understand why she walked out and I probably would of done the same thing. Its a TV show and they are real people not the enemy in the latest superhero movie. She has even said she was more mad with how CBS didn't even try that hard on keeping the crowd calm which to me is ridiculous because your simply setting an example that its ok to bully someone. Yes they only may have been just booing but imagine if they had more freedom to say what they wanted. That would of just been awful. If you want to tweet about certain players on the show like saying Dan is a sexist or something fine. But don't tweet it at them. Theirs two different types of people when it comes to Survivor. The one on TV and the one you don't really see. Its just a simple show which I think since what happened to Dawn during Caramoan people have sort of started to realize that a bit more now that these are real people. I'll my rant there though.

At least they got rid of it before it became too annoying.   But MY main reason for not liking it is the players. No one other than Kim, Colton and Troyzan even knew the game. Yes Colton sucked at the game but he knew and understood survivor. None of the women would make a move and just overall stupid game play that's frustrating to watch. Then there's the bullying of Christina by Colton and Alicia and the racist remarks Colton makes to Bill which isn't fun to watch. It's just a really bad cast.

People tend to be reserved or meek in their confessionals, and almost no one has a fiery personality except for the two most hated contestants. People come off as dumb or nearly worthless. There is somehow an overall feeling of depair and boredom as episodes feel longer than usual, duller than usual and quieter than usual.

One World is the only season I quit while was airing. I dropped it after the Bill's vote because I hated watching Colton so much that there was no pleasure in watching the show. This year I went back and started rewatching after his exit and I found it very enjoyable.

There was literally nobody who could challenge or take down Kim in One World.

It's down there for sure, but RI is definitely the most universally maligned.  One World plays out in a way that most people don't find particularly interesting, it has some really ugly drama, and it doesn't really have much in the way of complex characters with long-term storylines that you can get on board with rooting for. I myself don't think it's particularly bad Survivor - much better on  a rewatch - but those are the problems it does have."

Other than a fairly large portion of the cast being unlikable (not as bad as SJDS), you know how the very starting initial tribe one is placed in is such a strong bond with people that alliances from starting tribes almost always go all the way to the end together? You know how women have an in-group preference and will favor other women over men about 5 times more frequently? Well combine these 2 factors as the tribes start separated by gender. Eventually there is a tribe shuffle where new, temporary, alliances are formed. Eventually there is a merge where multiple men think that the women will take THEM to the end and not keep all the girls, so those guys vote against the other guys. Smart moves like that keep happening, it's not very fun to watch.  The women are pathetic at camp and need to steal from the guy's camp for basic survival, doesn't leave a feeling of deserving winners.  The winner of the season actually broke the rules and cheated to avoid what was going to be a successful idol play that would've left 5 guys VS 5 girls if not interrupted.

survivor,3dw7bf,AlbrechtEinstein,6,Mon Jul 20 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"I rewatched that part for you. It looks like Tony was digging for a while, which they didn't show because it would be boring. When he grabs the idol, it's easy to pull out of the dirt because he has just uncovered it by digging (and remember it was only recently buried by producers, so the earth is loose already). Tony has his hand on the idol, then the camera pans up to his face, then back so you can see the ground and his hand on the idol again, all in one shot. I'm not sure what they could be trying to hide by panning up to his face for a half-second? I think the camera movement is just so they could get a reaction shot.  If Tony found the idol when no cameras were on him, they would have him re-enact the idol finding, because it's an essential moment for the show. That's about as staged as Survivor gets, and I don't think it makes the show fake - the game itself is still unplanned and unscripted, and they only stage things when the camera crew fucked up.   However, I don't think this was the case in this particular scene, because Tony's excitement seems very real and very Tony. Also, he was such a big player that season, no one would have let him go off into the jungle without a camera on him."

I am however sceptical considering there have been no solid reports of it even now 10 years later.

survivor,3dtyfz,PaulSurvivor,6,Mon Jul 20 14:09:34 2015 UTC,"When Cindy chose to keep her car reward, the editors made a lot of Rafe's reaction. To Rafe's mind, it was such a better idea to give cars to four other people rather than keep her car for herself that he thought Cindy had ""no choice"" but to give the reward away, and he was genuinely surprised when she didn't.  Within the context of that episode, it seems like the editors were setting up Cindy's boot, but I think they really were foreshadowing Rafe's boot.  I think Rafe was a genuinely good-hearted guy, but his weakness was that he assumed other people thought like him. You see it in the incident with the car, first when he was surprised that Cindy didn't give the reward away, and then again immediately following when he was surprised the other women all agreed with Cindy's choice. You see it with the sacrificed chicken, when he was surprised that the others all chose to eat the meat, but he couldn't bring himself to eat it.  The same behavior finally burned him when he ""released"" Danni from her promise to take him to the final tribal council. I think it was an earnestly magnanimous gesture, but at the same time, he apparently believed he wasn't taking a risk. By his own admission, he assumed Danni would take him anyway, not because she was bound by her word, but because, to Rafe's mind, it was the smart choice and therefore the only choice. Oops."
survivor,3dtyfz,acktar,5,Sun Jul 19 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think there might have been a perception that Danni was nowhere as threatening and dangerous as she actually was, which led Rafe and the Nakúm alliance to not want to get rid of her. The other issue, as best as I can tell, was that neither Rafe nor Stephenie were popular. While Stephenie had as much of a chance to win Guatemala as Ulong did at winning Immunity in Palau, Rafe also was responsible for a lot of the blindsides and moves that fractured Nakúm; he could well have lost to Lydia or Cindy at FTC.  I think, at the end of the day, Rafe was more focused on getting to the end, period. He might not have been thinking about how he could win at the end as he made his moves."

survivor,3dtyfz,PadishahEmperor,4,Sun Jul 19 20:16:53 2015 UTC,They didn't show it but in the end game of Guatemala Danni was extremely sick.  According to  Rafe via Survivor Historians Danni's illness combine with Rafe's knowledge of prior final immunity challenges he thought there was a better chance of beating Danni than Lydia.  Out of the final 4 Stephanie was probably the only one Rafe could have won against at the end (it's very possible he would lose to Cindy too).
survivor,3dtyfz,beyoncerocks,4,Sun Jul 19 15:20:46 2015 UTC,Lydia is useless in challenges.  Thinking Lydia would be more threat than even a sick Danni in any challenge is ridiculous.

survivor,3dtyfz,beyoncerocks,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"Lydia was a jury threat, but Danni was the biggest jury threat, and far and away a bigger challenge threat (under any conditiion) than Lydia.  If Steph and Rafe wanted to be the F2 together, voting out Lydia over Danni was stupid.  Even sick Danni was very capable of winning any challenge.  Lydia had no shot at winning the final endurance challenge, and would just be voted out by whichever of Steph and Rafe won.  Regardless of his F2 deal with Danni, Rafe should have never wanted to possibly go up against Danni at the end anyway.  Danni broke the deal anyway too, and says she would have even if Rafe had not released her from it."
survivor,3dtyfz,destinystepchild,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Of course, I totally agree. On the challenge front, it was moronic to vote out Lydia over Danni, and probably on the jury front too. (Although I have heard Lydia was a much more active presence in Guatemala than her edit suggested.) Was just saying I thought I had read the decision was driven by the jury threat logic and not the challenge threat. Dumb move either way."
survivor,3dtyfz,beyoncerocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"No way Lydia was winning the last challenge so how much of a jury threat she was (and I agree she could beat Steph and probably Rafe in a jury vote) it was almost meaningless.   Danni was both nearly unbeatable for Steph or Rafe in a jury vote, and had a big chance to win any challenge, even sick.     I suspect Rafe atleast didnt even realize how much a jury threat Danni was, and thought Danni would take him to the F2 even over more obvious goat Steph as she promised if she won.  Both which were mistakes.   Steph did want to vote Danni out, but went along with what made Rafe happy."
survivor,3dtyfz,destinystepchild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:36:49 2015 UTC,That makes sense to me... I think Rafe was a much less savvy player than he appeared. And Danni a much more capable winner than she's given credit for.
survivor,3dtyfz,beyoncerocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:26 2015 UTC,"Rafe had a simple strategy.  Convince Steph to get rid of all the goats (eg- Jamie, Judd, even Cindy) so she felt she had no choice but to take him to the end.    It is hilarious Steph went along with it.  However since Lydia was not a goat and Steph was always going to take Rafe to the end over either Danni or Lydia, this strategy had run its course.  I agree he is overrated greatly in game saavy, and pretty much just lucky Steph, Danni, and Lydia all liked him.   Danni is for sure a way underrated winner."
survivor,3dtyfz,agrippas133,3,Mon Jul 20 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying, and I do think it was a bad move. However Rafe was under the impression that both Steph and Danni would take him to the final two, and he didn’t have a final two deal with Lydia. If Lydia had a choice she would have taken Steph to the final two, and Rafe knew it. The edit of Guatemala doesn’t make a good job in presenting Steph as the goat she was. Rafe thought that by taking both Danni and Steph he is guaranteeing himself a place in the final two. In hindsight we know that Danni would have voted out Rafe no matter what, but her social game was so good, that she was able to convince Rafe that she would take him."
survivor,3dtyfz,beyoncerocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:30 2015 UTC,Rafe could not beat Danni in a F2 ever.   Lydia was not winning the final challenge ever so who she would have taken to the F2 is irrelevant.   Rafe should have known the odds of Danni going back on her word were much higher than Lydia ever winning the final challenge (along with that nobody was beating Danni in a jury vote).  All around it was stupid and not well thought out.
survivor,3dtyfz,agrippas133,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:22 2015 UTC,"Rafe choice in the final four was wrong, but not stupid. As other people pointed out, Danni was sick and therefore wasn’t considered a challenge threat. Also, you can never really know what the final challenge will be. Does anyone would have put his money on Kim J. against Ethan and Lex in Africa, or on Susie against Bob and Matty in Gabon?  And Rafe was well liked by the juries. Danni is the favorite against Rafe, but it is far than a close deal as Steph vs. Danni was."
survivor,3dtyfz,tpoint32,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Danni was on the verge of being medevac'd and they thought that between them they would very likely beat her in any challenge.  Lydia also really needed the money and had nowhere near as much blood on her hands as Rafe or Steph. She may not have beaten Rafe but it would have been close. Rafe and Steph both knew they had to go to the end with each other for either to have a good shot at winning.
survivor,3dtyfz,imuahmanila,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:43:00 2015 UTC,I love Rafe but he's the textbook example of playing an amazing game only to choke at the last minute. His blind spot for Danni is one of the bigger mistakes in Survivor history and unfortunately his demise was deserved.

You really hamper your casting if you say you have to have five people from a certain group. So I don't think that's something that has to happen forever. But I think (executive producer) Mark (Burnett) and CBS wanted to show that we didn't just do it as a gimmick. We really want to incorporate more diversity into the show.

survivor,3ds7f6,AjNeale,6,Sun Jul 19 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"The problem is that for partial returnee seasons, the players returning are usually put in leader roles. Historically, female contestants in Survivor don't take those leader roles compared to male contestants like B-Rob, Russell, Penner, Ozzy, etc.   Stephanie is one of the few female characters that carried herself as a leader that needed a redemption role. People like Kim and Denise would be great, but they've already won. And Cire, Amanda and Parvati have already had their redemption chance. Finding a standout female contestant who hasn't had a redemption chance yet and would do well in a leadership role is a bit hard to find.  Aside from them, Andrea comes to mind as a standout pick along with Brenda possibly as a head-to-head season like SoPa. Other possibilities could be Chelsea (One World), Erinn (Tocantins), Taj (Tocantins) and Carolyn (World's Apart).  I think part of the blame is on the edit, but it's also on how the game works. Women tend to play more of an UTR game rather than standout with bold personalities - but the ones that do, tend to go all the way or fall very short."

(jerri vs colby might have worked but i think it is too late for that)  the only real female possibilities at this point are amanda and cirie.   buuut, cambodia just may provide a female duo that could work. a lot of potential there for a female that is already thought of highly to increase her presence.

If the stick was actually an idol and Jason helped Eliza idol out Ozzy, then he'd have made a huge move we'd never forget.

survivor,3drm8e,TheNobullman,5,Sat Jul 18 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"Eh, those are not the best comparisons.

Jason had a stick in his hand. (The Jeff comparison is not about weighing evidence, so I'm not sure why you're making it.)  By contrast, JT had to make a decision on the basis of his brief interactions with Russell at challenges; the self-destruction of the Villains as the males got voted out; the precedent of Parvati (especially), Sandra and Courtney engaging in female-heavy alliances; and the fact that people like Randy, Tyson and Coach were classified as Villains.

There are probably hundreds of scenarios that could have gone differently across the 30 seasons of Survivor that would produce different results. Does it make so and so a great player or what they did a great move? Not necessarily, but it does mean that in a situation where they did things differently, they had potential.

You could argue that if they waited and took Sandra in when she offered her vote, then they'd still make it out alive. However, they had reason to believe Russell was on the outs whereas it appeared Sandra was in a majority alliance on the Villains tribe. It makes sense that they didn't trust her in a way when they thought they might already have Russell in their pocket and she could just be trying to screw them over.  I'm not saying what they did was a genius move. I'm saying they were misinformed and took a risk that didn't work out for them."

survivor,3drm8e,wc311,6,Sat Jul 18 21:36:13 2015 UTC,"For me, it's flipping at the merge on a season that didn't have a tribe swap. Your original tribemates would feel so betrayed, regardless of what came before, that your chances of getting a Jury vote from them diminishes significantly. When done, it is usually for self-preservation reasons, but it is usually a move that won't be respected. So that honor goes to John Cochran."
survivor,3drm8e,m4milo,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"I kind of say Cochran's move as a way to keep himself in the game. He could have taken a rock and had a 15% chance of going home right then and there (or however much I do t remember how many people were left and who had immunity that tribal), or a 100% chance of staying and trying to pull something together in the next few rounds."
survivor,3drm8e,Kevtotheoh,3,Sat Jul 18 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I agree that a move like that is for self-preservation reasons, to keep you at least a couple more days in the game, but I also feel your chances of getting Jury votes from your former tribemates, if you make it to FTC, diminishes drastically unless you suddenly start playing your best game ever. Another example was Kass, there were other factors why people labeled her as a goat, but making that flip at the merge had a lot to do with it."
survivor,3drm8e,m4milo,3,Sat Jul 18 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"Once he flipped he had a 0% chance of winning. If he didn't flip, he maybe pulls the rock, but there's that 85% chance he doesn't, and he has like a 60% chance of winning the million by my estimation. Savaii was going to boot Ozzy in like 9th as soon as they didn't need him, and then pagong Upolu the rest of the time. They'd need to boot Keith at 5 to split Keithney and remove his pacemaker sob story, and they'd need to boot Dawngel as a major jury threat. Final 3 of Jim, Cochran and Whitney, I think Cochran almost certainly wins. Whitney was annoying and had money already, Jim ""had a temper"" or whatever the editing said. Upolu seemed to like Cochran enough."

survivor,3drm8e,weso123,0,Sun Jul 19 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know that much of that's backed up in the show anyway. Upolu seemed to like Cochran after he flipped for sure. Insert scene of him in Coach's jacket and Rick's hat with everyone laughing. Coach in particular really took to Cochran. I don't think the whole ""build resume/who played the most aggressively"" is a real thing and my thought is Cochran would win in the same way that HvV Sandra did, which is pretty much how he won Caramoan anyway.   Also Brandon was going to win if he made FTC, per Sophie, Jim and Coach, so I definitely don't think the jury was gung-ho about voting a gamebot."
survivor,3drm8e,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"I verified the tribe standings going into that Tribal Council. It was six on six, counting Cochran. At the previous Immunity Challenge, both Dawn and Ozzy won individual Immunity. So now it's 6 on 4. Ozzy also had the Hidden Immunity Idol and he played it for Whitney, so at that moment it was 6 on 3. Coach had a HII but he didn't play it.  If it was still a 6-6 tie and it went to rocks, 3 people from Savaii are safe (2 Individual Immunities plus 1 HII). The two persons that were voted for are also eliminated from the rock drawing. So that leaves 2 people from Savaii and 5 people from Upolu to draw rocks. Each of them would have a starting 14.29% chance of drawing a rock.  You were right on the money with the percentage."

This is the cardinal fuck-up of Survivor. Cochranning/ShiiAnning your tribe is the dumbest thing anyone can do short of, like, jumping into the fire. You lose 5 jury votes immediately and you're 7th on your new tribe, or at best dragged as a goat. It's better to be 6th on your original tribe and plan to win 3 or 4 immunities in a row, even if you're as athletic as Cochran, than to flip and have 0 chance of the million."

Then at final 5, Jim needs to split Keithney's voting power and remove Keith's pacemaker story as a jury threat, so Keith's likely 5th. Then no one is going to FTC with Dawn that season, so she's likely 4th. In F3 with Whitney and Jim, I'd say Cochran has a very high chance of getting the Upolu votes."

If J'Tia went that round, Kass or Tasha was going next 100%. Neither of them wanted to go home, so they booted Garrett instead, making them the top of the tribe until swap. It's better to lose every immunity but never be in danger than to be the bottom of a winning tribe, in 3 tribe seasons and especially in a 3 tribe season with a swap. Instead of being on the chopping block at F4, Tasha and Kass got to decide between Spencer and J'Tia."
survivor,3drm8e,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:27:50 2015 UTC,"They didn't know that Garrett had the idol. Spencer was the closest to him and even then he thought David had it. They could have pulled in Spencer sooner and made him their third. Spencer would still be lower on the tribe's totem pole, and they would have gotten rid of their weakest member both physically and mentally. Losing every immunity challenge isn't immediately preferable either, as given how Kass and Tasha didn't know how the swap would play out (or even when it would happen) either one of them could have ended up alone and picked-off easily.  That said voting Garrett out was definitely the easiest to control the Brains, but if the swap didn't go how they wanted in the end it wouldn't mean anything."

survivor,3duahb,PaulSurvivor,-19,Sun Jul 19 15:52:00 2015 UTC,"This is almost a perfect analogy, but only if you add that the ice cream gives you diabetes. Cagayan's still pretty bad and harmful, but not nearly as much as WA, and at least it's sweet and fun first."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,7,Sun Jul 19 16:02:46 2015 UTC,How is Cagayan bad and harmful?
survivor,3duahb,timlwalsh,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"Well after the Sarah boot the whole season is terrible; it's just the Tony and Spencer show and all they talk about is ""strategy"" and who is/isn't ""playing the game. It's harmful because the season is literally propaganda for Probst's love of big moves and blindsides and alpha males. They edited the show so that Tony looks like an aggressive strategist who people dislike and who crosses the line, and then the jury rewards him for being a shitbag because ""that's playing the game"". In reality, Tony was beloved and respected by his tribe and had great social connections that allowed him to be forgiven for his shittiness. So they essentially tried to edit the season so that Tony seems like a Russell Hantz with a ""non-bitter"" jury who ""respects the game"" when in reality Tony played more like Natalie White: He made good connections with people, got them to like him, and basically never made things personal with anyone. Cagayan has amped up the idiocy in the fanbase so that you now have folks talking about ""building a resume"" for FTC, or how ""the social game"" is only part of Survivor, or how Russell would have won with Cagayan's jury, or with a Spencer on his jury. Cagayan did more damage to the fanbase than any other post-HvV season.   ETA: If someone here has a coherent rebuttal and the basic language skills to try to tell me why I'm wrong, I'm all ears. Downvoting me because you don't like the true things I am saying, when I am not being inflammatory whatsoever, seems counterproductive."

survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,-4,Sun Jul 19 21:32:24 2015 UTC,Aloled at this. Well done.
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,5,Sun Jul 19 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about certain things, like that Tony and Spencer were shown a little too much over other interesting characters between the Morgan boot and the Jefra boot (although after that the editing is much more even and I think the last few episodes are some of the best of the season).  But I think you're really overgeneralizing with Tony. He was not even remotely like Natalie White. Tasha compared Tony to Russell Hantz in an episode of the show, so you can't blame that on editing. Tony did make things personal with people like going back on his badge with Sarah, the word of his dead family members with Trish, apparently some sexism towards Tasha. Hence the angry jury at the end of the season. Sarah disliked him, LJ disliked him, Tasha really disliked him, Trish was upset with him. He had spats with Kass, so she probably wasn't a huge fan of him. That being said, Tony obviously made far deeper personal connections with people than Russell did or else he wouldn't have won. But I think in the end, the vote came down to the lesser of two evils for most of the jury. People didn't like ""Weasel"" Woo and people didn't like Tony, but for some they liked Tony more, and for others they appreciated Tony's gameplay more.  I think you're misunderstanding some basic principles of Survivor. The game is about getting to the end and getting people to give you their vote. Some people are going to vote based on who they liked more, some are going to vote based on who they thought played a better game. There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to vote, it's not wrong for someone to vote for someone because they made big moves. But it's the finalist's job to figure out how to get each person's vote.  And also, I honestly don't think it's a bad thing that many people think you need to make big moves to win. Obviously that's not necessarily true, but perception is reality, and if that's the perception, it'll make for far more entertaining seasons with more unpredictable boot orders in my opinion."
survivor,3duahb,timlwalsh,4,Sun Jul 19 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"Tony obviously made far deeper personal connections with people than Russell did or else he wouldn't have won.   This is exactly my point. Tony says that for every hour he spent strategizing, he spent like 20 socializing and making friends. They showed practically none of this and we're given no reason to accept that people like having Tony around or would want him to win. That is the issue. They made it seem like Tony was hated when from all interviews, he was well liked.    think you're misunderstanding some basic principles of Survivor. The game is about getting to the end and getting people to give you their vote. Some people are going to vote based on who they liked more, some are going to vote based on who they thought played a better game. There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to vote, it's not wrong for someone to vote for someone because they made big moves. But it's the finalist's job to figure out how to get each person's vote.   Everyone votes based on who they want to win more, and that is the person they like most AND who played the best game in their eyes. No one votes for someone they think played a worse game. The issue is that Probst and Production are the ones trying to tell jurors how to vote by creating this stigma against ""bitter"" jurors and having Spencers and Jeremys give speeches about how they need to vote for the most aggressive person or they're not respecting the game.   The TV aspect is what Probst is going for, for sure. The issue is that makes shitty TV. The whole pathos of Survivor is that they have to make moral decisions and cross lines to survive, so if you erase all of that and make this strictly a game show where there are no lines and you just make big moves and are forgiven, it becomes insubstantial, pointless, popcorn movie, Big Brother style awfulness like post-merge Cagayan. There's not a lot of character development and no one has to struggle with decisions (in large part because Tony is the only one with any deciding power via his idols and position in the middle) and that's not great TV. We'd get a lot of fun unsubstantial Micronesia/Cagayan seasons, but also a bunch of unfun unsubstantial WA seasons where people are just as hyped to ""play the game hard"" but suck and make really bad TV."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree about Tony, although maybe they were just trying to make his win less obvious. Since he was never in danger of being voted out and was pretty much always in power. Maybe it was just to put some doubt in and make the viewer think Woo had a shot.   The TV aspect is what Probst is going for, for sure. The issue is that makes shitty TV. The whole pathos of Survivor is that they have to make moral decisions and cross lines to survive, so if you erase all of that and make this strictly a game show where there are no lines and you just make big moves and are forgiven, it becomes insubstantial, pointless, popcorn movie, Big Brother style awfulness like post-merge Cagayan.   We do still get moments of people compromising their morals and things like that (Trish's jury speech for example), but overall, that's not really what the show is about anymore. And I'm actually happy about that, because in small doses, those types of things can be very powerful and entertaining, but too much of it and it becomes like All-Stars (ie really uncomfortable).   There's not a lot of character development   I don't really understand how you could think that. Maybe you need to rewatch Cagayan. There are so many great character-driven moments.   We'd get a lot of fun unsubstantial Micronesia/Cagayan seasons, but also a bunch of unfun unsubstantial WA seasons where people are just as hyped to ""play the game hard"" but suck and make really bad TV.   WA sucked because most of the endgamers were terrible players. They all just sat completely content in an alliance of like 8 people and didn't utilize the outcasts like Jenn and Shirin to try to put themselves in power. And then people like Tyler, Dan, Sierra are surprised when they get voted out. Also, look at SJDS. Natalie A said in the show that she was trying to play like Tony in order to win and it led to really entertaining moves that put her in a position to win.  I really don't get why you complain so much about the show. If you don't like the type of show that it's become, then don't watch it."

Can you think of anything in particular post-merge where we learn something new about the characters, or where one of them changes? I feel like saying their are fun character driven moments is true, but that just means there are entertaining personalities doing things. I don't believe Cagayan's post-merge featured actual development though.  I continue watching the show because they CAN still put out great seasons. SJDS is a top 5 season. Philiipines, Nicaragua and BvW were pretty great. Cagayan's pre-merge was strong."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:41 2015 UTC,I think there's a lot but definitely the main one is Kass became a mega villain from being the kinda snarky MOR neutral character she was during premerge. Also Woo becoming villainous.
survivor,3duahb,timlwalsh,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:01 2015 UTC,The first moment that comes to my mind in regards to learning something new about the characters is when we see how great Woo is with kids and how that causes people to admire him a bit more. Quite exaggerating.

They all made the right decision but Mike messed everything up for them, they couldn't have predicted his immunity run.   You're right about what you said about Cagayan in my opinion, shutupredneckman2 is just being really ignorant and should probably rewatch the season. It wasn't just the Spencer/Tony show, Kass got a lot of airtime, Tasha, LJ, and Trish did as well. Going into the finale a lot of us even thought Woo could win. I guess he just strives to be controversial in this sub."
survivor,3duahb,reeforward,3,Sun Jul 19 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, you need to rewatch. Tasha, Trish and LJ did not get ""a lot of airtime"". They had equal or fewer confessionals than Sarah, who went out rounds earlier than any of them. The post-merge is legit Spencer and Tony talking forever with a little Kass thrown in from time to time.  Woo wasn't the winner contender because he got much/any airtime, it was because what little time he did get seemed deliberately crafted. I'm not just being controversial for fun, that's idiotic. This sub just has a hivemind hard-on for the fun, substanceless seasons."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,2,Sun Jul 19 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"First off, what are your opinions on Tony as a character, do you just dislike the amount of airtime he got or do you also dislike his personality? Anyways I researched the confessional count, Tony had almost 30 more overall confessionals than Spencer, who had 68, and Kass had 5 less than Spencer. Those 3 were the stars of the season. Then Woo has 36 overall, but he he barely got airtime in the premerge, getting 6 confessionals in the first 7 episodes, so obviosly in the next 7 episodes he got 30 overall, so Woo was also a big part of the postmerge. Then Tasha, LJ and Sarah were in the high 20s, Trish at 23, and who cares about the rest. I'll admit, it's a bit more lopsided than I thought. Obviously you hate Worlds Apart more than Cagayan, I'm with you on that WA didn't use multiple people to their full potential, Cagayan definitley did that better the only characters that we didn't get anything out of were David, Alexis, Morgan and Jefra. As for there being so much Tony, I don't know about you, but I love seeing Tony on my television he's so charismatic and hilarious, and his game was so fun to watch, I'm not trying to hate on Mike but he's no Tony. Tony was there to play, but we also got good character moments like when we learned about him having to leave his newborn baby to play, he wasn't just a ""gamebot"", he was always to eccentric to be one. It makes way more sense for a Tony to take up screentime than it does for say a Russell.  As for Woo being a possible winner, I think it had to do with his character moments (him interacting with the kids, him talking about wanting to marry his girlfriend), his likability, and the fact that we realized it was a final 2. I don't understand what you mean about his little airtime being deliberately crafted.  I'm not changing your mind and you aren't changing mine, but stop being so condescending in everything you say as if your opinion is factual.  Sorry it's long I kinda rambled."

survivor,3duahb,nakothenacho,3,Sun Jul 19 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"There is not anything objectively wrong with watching that way per se. It's similar to watching Walking Dead for the zombies and gore, or Game of Thrones for the swordfighting and dragons. My argument, obviously, would be that it's pretty shallow and silly to watch substantial media for the flashy parts. Survivor at its best is an excellent drama with crafted storytelling, characters that are explored and developed, etc. so while I suppose it's not objectively inferior to watch such a show for big moves and people talking about strategy over and over, I just think it's a waste of the audience's brains and disrespectful to the talent of the storytellers."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:07 2015 UTC,But what does that say about the contestants out there? Crafting the show is certainly no easy feet and making sure that everyone gets a story to tell but neither is actually being out there and making a strategy just as making a zombie on the walking dead isn't easy

I'm just saying that's all the flashy and shallow part of the television show. It does take a lot of work to create a cool zombie and the makeup/special effects people do a great job, but there isn't a lot to think about with the zombies besides ""whoa that looks really cool and gross""."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:09:15 2015 UTC,My point was that if there is an appreciation for crafting then the same should be said for those out there trying to win and strategize
survivor,3duahb,nakothenacho,4,Mon Jul 20 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"But they aren't crafting anything. Some people do play/act in a specific way to try to craft their own story lines for better (Coach, Sugar) or worse (Dan Foley) but it's not like they're creating some work of art. Like I said though, I'm not disrespecting people who are playing the game; I'm just saying there's a lot more to the art of the show than just the basic actions."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Game of Thrones is an intelligent show with great acting, character development, writing, etc etc. But it's complemented by big, flashy moments like the Red Wedding. Without the flashy moments the great character development and writing becomes pretty dull and monotonous and the show becomes frustrating because there's lots of build-up with no pay-off. That's pretty similar to blindsides in Survivor. The show needs to have big moments so that character development and ""crafted storytelling"" pays off. It doesn't matter how interesting and developed characters are, if nothing interesting or surprising happens to those characters, you might as well be watching a marathon of nature documentaries. Or Terrence Malick films."
survivor,3duahb,timlwalsh,3,Mon Jul 20 01:47:52 2015 UTC,"Now see where I'm coming from is that the Red Wedding isn't just flash at all. It's the culmination of important story lines and the tragic ending of Robb. It's a lot of closure and pay-off to story lines.   Similarly, there are very big blindsides in Survivor that are amazing from a character standpoint. Gretchen and John Carroll and Sarah Lacina and so on. They have stories and developed characters that make the blindsides epic and substantial.  On the flipside, Barristan's end in GoT was a stupid blindside because it was done mostly for shock factor and wasn't built up with the story at all, and was just a poor character choice (especially knowing the character had a bunch of cool stuff left they could have adapted).   Similarly, Probst seems to like episodes where someone is just blindsided without it making any sense in a long-term narrative, like with LJ where they tried to throw together a downfall at the last second with a couple ominous statements.   I totally agree big moments need to happen, but they need to serve the characters and not vice versa."
survivor,3duahb,Shutupredneckman2,2,Mon Jul 20 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"Oh...then I guess we agree haha. I love the Sarah blindside for that reason. I mean, yeah, the LJ blindside didn't have a huge story, but there was one there, it's just very subtle. LJ has confessionals in the Cliff boot ep where he says that it doesn't make sense and it's stupid for Trish and Tony to go against their numbers advantage and take out one of their own. And his aversion to going against an alliance shines through when Tasha asks him to speak and she gets #stoodup. I found LJ's boot more interesting for that reason on a rewatch. He's kinda this slightly arrogant character that doesn't understand people/the game as much as he thinks he does."

Take Cagayan. Woo didn't do much at all, but he was a fantastic character because he was given motivations and reason for doing things. He was given a personality.   In WA, Sierra for example didn't do much either, but she didn't get much of an edit at all. We never knew why she always chose to side with Rodney's alliance.

But I do remember reading an EW interview with Jeff Probst around the time of Fans vs Favourites where he was asked who he would have liked to see make the cast or something. He said that he would have wanted both Matt Elrod and Shambo but neither one of them wanted to do it. It had something to do with them not wanting Survivor to define them and once was enough or something like that. Now that Matt's acting career as Wyatt Nash is starting to take off, I can understand it but I loved his character and would have been thrilled to see him back for another shot. Same with Shambo."

Jacklyn Schultz: Former Beauty queen, played a pretty solid social game that allowed her to float for really long. Looks really hot, but also has a great message for people suffering from her condition.  Colby Donaldson: Was constantly said to be the best looking ever on survivor, so many people swooned over him in Australia and ASS.  J.T. Thomas: Southern Charm at its finest. Played a perfect game, and relied almost completely on social qualities. Plus he aint bad to look at either.  Brett Clouser: CGI Brett from Samoa NEEDS another chance. Hes a great ""boy next door"" filler and played a great strategic/physical game in Samoa, but his social game often gets overlooked. If he had won the last IC he would have won Samoa in a landslide, simply because he was great friends with everyone. And he looked good while doing it."

Yes of course he won challenges that saved his ass from one or two tribals where he was probably being targeted and also had some strategic moves that he and fish made together, but his success came from his likability, relationships and connections."

In my casting I avoided winners and three-timers. I also tried to think of who CBS would realistically cast (taking into account popularity of contestants and diversity).  For Brawn, I'd choose Danielle DiLorenzo, Tasha Fox and Carolyn Rivera for the women and Joe Anglim, Erik Reichenbach and Frosti Zernow for the men.   For Brains, I'd choose Josh Canfield, Yau-Man Chan and Lex van den Berghe for the men and Trish Hegarty, Taj Johnson-George and Natalie Bolton for the women.

She's not entrenched in pre-game alliances like Ciera, but she's not alienated by being from an older season like Peih-Gee and Savage are. Plus she fits the mould of ""underestimated/overlooked female player"", but even people who know about that would overlook her because she can in no way fly under the radar (think HvV Sandra).

Sandra technically still applies for UTR female, but she's never exactly been the flirty type.

survivor,3dsd3q,TheDemonicEmperor,2,Sun Jul 19 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't exactly matter.

However, Season 33 is way too soon for that - I think it would be a great format for a Legends season at 40.   In terms of tribe divisions, I think it would be interesting if we saw 3 tribes of 6 with each tribe having an equal amount of people from each generation of Survivor. Having multiple smaller tribes and having the people they played with on other tribes would facilitate those cross tribe dynamics better.   Sidenote: I think adding Exile Island with a person from each of the losing tribes going to exile might help increase those dynamics when they get back - sort of like the Tocantins cross tribe alliance."

survivor,3dq9ku,feline_crusader,8,Sat Jul 18 12:32:40 2015 UTC,I don't see how Nina fits into that group. Can someone explain to me why she's so hated over here?
survivor,3dq9ku,as1992,3,Sat Jul 18 14:33:55 2015 UTC,Nina was painful to watch on television. I was so relieved when she was voted out.
survivor,3dq9ku,emily5678123,2,Sun Jul 19 00:19:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Nina is one of those people who takes her disability and uses it as an excuse for everything.  I'm not trying to downplay her disability by any means, I believe it was very brave of her to go on a show that is all about communication when she can't really hear.  Buuutt... For example, when Jenn and Hali went skinny dipping, they didn't invite her because Nina was a lot older and a mother, and probably wouldn't be in to that sort of thing, but Nina instead blamed it on her disability and made a huge deal out of it.  That's why I wasn't a fan of her and why she drove me crazy."
survivor,3dq9ku,SamuraiShark13,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:07 2015 UTC,"This is totally off-topic, but when reading that, about halfway through I assumed you were talking about Amazon and just misspelled Jenna and Heidi.

survivor,3dq9ku,JurassicBasset,0,Sat Jul 18 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"She fucked up so bad when she, Vince and Will were in a golden position to vote off Jenn when her, Hali and Joe were going to split votes. She is the reason Vince went so early.   I hate really hate Nina."
survivor,3dq9ku,feline_crusader,18,Sun Jul 19 05:42:39 2015 UTC,So messing up strategically and getting a preseason (I say preseason because this sub suddenly hated him after episode 1 aired) favourite voted out warrants her being on a list with the rest of those terrible people and Julie?   Personally I find Nina's story and her as a character one of the most compelling of WA. I can live without a Nina return but I just don't understand the seemingly popular opinion around here that Nina is literally Hitler for messing up.
survivor,3dq9ku,jlim201,2,Sun Jul 19 08:04:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if Jenn went home, is Nina as interesting of a character?"
survivor,3dq9ku,feline_crusader,3,Sat Jul 18 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"That's hard to say, really. A lot of what I like about Nina's story is the fact that she is ""too white collar for no collar"" and if she makes the swap the possibility of that being her story goes out the window. I think that 3rd boot is perfect for Nina's story and if she gets farther it's ruined."
survivor,3dq9ku,as1992,0,Sat Jul 18 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"Why? All she did was moan for no reason, it was awful tv having to watch her."

But vote with us tonight okaii <3 :)""   ""They didn't invite me to go skinny dipping THEY HAVE NO HUMAN COMPASSION! D:""  ""Voting out Jenn will be my REVENGE!!! >:D""  Nina being such a caricature combined with her great story makes her a top 5 WA contestant for me."

survivor,3dq9ku,weso123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:02:28 2015 UTC,I'd say Kathy's inelligible because having a mental breakdown out there shows she isn't mentally stable enough to be on survivor  It's the same reason that sugar is almost certianly inelligible since her sucide attempt in heroes vs. villians definately shows she isn't mental stable enough

I thought they were faker than faux fur which sort of bothered me. The dark meat comment is also great and but is more of a Nick moment imo.  It's funny because in ASS I thought that when the Touchy Subjects challenge happened and the 'who is least deserving of being an All Star' question came up that it would be Amber or Jenna because I saw the Kimmi fight as such an iconic moment and was shocked when it was Alicia lol."

Ramona Gray - she couldn't stomach it at 29, she won't stomach it today.  Kel Gleason - is universally considered a cheater and seemingly had no lasting bonds with anybody from the game. Cannot see how he's making it through the first vote and he is not entertaining enough for the premier to be centered around him.  Kim Johnson - we want people who play to  win. Not people who play mediocrely just to get to pick who to sit next to, so they can win.  Zoe Zanidakis - one of the least interesting characters ever. Cannot think of one reason to bring her back.  Robb Zbacnik - a violent a-hole without a hint of self-awareness. Great TV, does not deserve a call back.  JoAnna Ward - if you have a religious objection to the mechanics of the game, you probably should stay home.  Lillian Morris - it took her 39 days to remotely understand the game, which made her cry. She is not built for this at all.  Sue Hawk - after hearing Lex's version of Sue's quit, I'm buying it even less. Has no business being called back.  Scout Cloud Lee - she had so much trouble walking 11 years ago that she shat right outside the shelter. I don't wanna think of where she will do her business today.

Unfortunately, the only ones I could really see them bringing back at this point are Deena or Heidi. I can't really see them bringing Butch/Matt back. Christy I would think says no. Alex I'm iffy on, but say for example he was on this year's second chance ballot..I would be shocked if he was selected, and to the survivor producers alone, I don't think Alex is someone that screams to them returnee.   Deena might be in that same position as Alex where if she was on the SC ballot this year she might not make it, but put her on a similar SC ballot say for S16 and she has a shot. Fans and survivor as far as I know both loved her and the only thing against her is time. While fans might not want her back right now, survivor could throw her on anyway especially seeing that fans still remember/want to see old school in general with this past SC ballot.   Heidi is hot and is married to Cole Hamels, I think she has the biggest shot if she would agree to do it again. The thing is, I believe her and Cole have 2-3 kids plus one adopted, it would be hard for Heidi to leave that while Cole is pitching/spring training"

Just now looking at the edit history it seems there a bunch of different users, IPs, which makes it unlikely it is just 1 person anyway.    So based on that alone I doubt it is him, or any one person.    Grant should look at Kat Edersson.  Kim and her were really good friends and Kim still voted her off with 7 people left when she was no threat at all.   Rob voted Grant off when there were 5 left (and wasnt even planning to until there were 4 atleast) when he was a big threat to win the game, and took 2 goats who had no chance of winning the game instead.  So Rob had far better reason to vote Grant out than Kim did Kat which was nothing more than a ""someone has to go"" sort of thing, and Kat was a bridesmaid at Kim's wedding a couple years ago.  Also Rob went out of his way to try and soften the blow for Grant, even apologizing to him on his boot episode which he hasnt done for anyone he has voted off ever before, and making it clear it was a purely strategic choice and not a personal one.   Lastly his cutting off any contact with Rob for 5 years if far meaner than what Rob did to him by blindsiding him and voting him out, so he should feel he already more than got his revenge and end their silly  rift."

Which I'm glad they clarified Carson Palmer because anyone who knows Matt Nickels or cares about Grant the WR wouldn't know who Carson Palmer is.

survivor,3domtv,MasterofMarionettes,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Why do you make fun of Grant.  :(   He seems like a really good guy.  If his feelings were hurt by Rob it makes sense.   He thought they were good friends and then learnt the real truth when he was unceremoniously voted off for no good reason at all, and when Rob even lied to him about it before rather than atleast being upfront about it.   Not to mention the confessionals mocking and ridiculing his so called friend Grant."

It was pretty obvious that all the prior winners or people with big reputations (Rob C. and Colby) were going out early because the others didn't want them to win (people were talking about how that would happen before they filmed All-Stars).  By the time those players were all eliminated it was pretty clear that Amber and Rob M. would be the final 2.

I think the biggest problem for ASS is that the pre-ASS players took the game and the responsibilities revolving around the game FAR more seriously than post-ASS players does. Not to mention I feel like the players from those earlier seasons just cared more about making sure they looked as good as possible on the show.   As a result, it became an extremely negative and bitter season from almost everyone involved. It felt like more friendships were destroyed than created, and the legacy of almost everyone in the cast was tarnished in some way."

survivor,3dptmg,bwburke94,5,Sat Jul 18 08:36:09 2015 UTC,"Idols do protect from rocks. The Nicaragua rulebook sourced from Andy Dehnart did not include this for rocks immunity because the HII is still technically a ""twist"" and not in the rule book.

Either Dan goes home automatically or they don't follow the rules of the idol (idols save someone from drawing rock draws, I think of the merge in South Pacific).

Tocantins is voted out soon after.  Worlds Apart, San Juan Del Sur and Blood vs. Water are ganged up on by older seasons.  Seasons 21-26 get suspicious and vote out Borneo, Australia, Africa and Marquesas.   The remaining post-Heroes vs. Villains seasons cannot keep their alliance strong; Nicaragua tries to quit twice but Probst only lets them quit once. Caramoan is trying to unite the alliance under the shared goal of opening a dog bar, but One World keeps saying, “This is my dog bar!” Both seasons are voted out back to back. Redemption Island and South Pacific have a strange rivalry for weirdest cult tribe dynamic, and both tribes are voted out at a double tribal council.   Survivor Auction: Gabon buys a tray of cookies for the remaining seasons; Amazon takes their clothes off for the cookie even though they don’t have to. Samoa secretly burns the cookies at night.   That night at tribal, Samoa plays a HII that no one knew they had. Gabon immediately plays a HII, worried that they’ll be voted out. But the HII is fake! Gabon is voted out with only 2 votes.   Samoa finds another HII the next day, but little do they know, Cook Islands had a dream last night. Plan Voodoo is in full effect. Samoa is voted out that night with the HII in their pocket.   Tension between All Stars and Palau begin mounting as each tries to establish themselves as the strong alpha male leader (even though it’s clear to viewers that Palau is obviously better). All Stars is voted out after Palau definitely states, “We can’t work together because All Stars sucks at life.” Guatemala gets voted out next for having ADD. Damn scumbags, man.   Vanuatu and Palau make an alliance and Vanuatu swears on their son’s life that they won’t vote Palau out. After Cook Islands wins immunity that day, Vanuatu votes out Palau.   The other seasons get nervous about Vanuatu swearing on their son and vote out Vanuatu. As an attempt to build trust, Fiji promises to give the remaining 6 seasons Individual Immunity if Fiji wins at final 4. Fiji is voted out next.   Final 6. Each season is starting to get nervous around Amazon. Why do they need that machete so sharp? Panama worries that everyone will want to take Amazon to the end since they’re crazy. Panama orchestrates the elimination of Amazon in a 3-2-1 vote.   Micronesia wins immunity at the final 5. Panama is voted out for orchestrating the Amazon vote.   Micronesia wins immunity again at final 4. Micronesia and Cook Islands vote out Thailand and Philippines and Thailand vote for Cook Islands. Thailand and Cook Islands face off in a fire challenge – Thailand wins in 3 minutes, but as a way to redeem themselves on the way out, Cook Islands lets Probst snuff their torch, then sits back down to make their fire. Two hours later, Cook Islands goes to Ponderosa as the last juror.   Thailand, Micronesia and Philippines make it to the final 3. Thailand was able to skate by all the competition, going unnoticed as an unpopular season. The Micronesia Fans tribe felt the need to prove themselves, allowing them to Parvati their way through the game and dominate. Philippines used both physical and mental strength to make their way through the game.  Final Tribal Council is grueling. Fiji asks each of them how many numbers are in a million and Thailand reassures Fiji that they 150-200% know the answer. Micronesia falters in their answers, expecting a final 2 and clearly not prepared to face the worthier adversary of Philippines in a final 3. Philippines wins in a vote of 7-1-1."

survivor,3dni9s,hazier,2,Sat Jul 18 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"Well I thought I knew the strategy, but perhaps not … I can get to 2048 most of the time, after that the board gets so crowded with giant tiles that's it's hard to maneuver. With practice I've gotten better at getting out of jams – I've realized the most important thing is to not let any 32s or higher get stuck in places where they won't make it up to the row of high tiles for awhile. What others tips does can the 2048 master enlighten me with? :)"
survivor,3dni9s,dmcarefuldriver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah knowing the strategy goes so far, as many times as I've cracked the 4096 and above there's as many times as things just go wrong and I don't even make it to 2048, you know?  I work in lines, so going right to left with the bottom left square being the 'home square', then once the bottom line is full with really big numbers I need to work towards I start working from left to right on the next line up - basically i match numbers by swiping them together sideways, rather than working on the line above and bringing them down.   That probably makes absolutely no sense haha"
survivor,3dni9s,hazier,2,Sat Jul 18 06:49:11 2015 UTC,"Makes lots of sense to another big fan of the game like me! I've yet to see a workable strategy that doesn't rely on a designated corner square and its row, so your strategy is necessarily similar to mine. I think I tend to try to swipe numbers into the row more than building them up horizontally like you do. Th takes a lot of position control, doesn't it? Because one low number can really screw up an entire chain. I'm always afraid of that because I'm not too good at getting out of jams. I'm sure someone like a chess player would be able to see multiple moves ahead and be much better at this.

survivor,3dmtwz,RobinReborn,9,Fri Jul 17 16:46:23 2015 UTC,I think production was feeding Kelly. I don't think Rich is being totally truthful here regarding his taxes purely because of this:  His personal accountant testified under oath that Rich had her prepare two tax returns; 1 with his Survivor money and 1 without. He stated that he knows that he has to pay taxes on that money but he wanted to see what it would look like when he compared the two. He then filed his return omitting the Survivor money.  Also he didn't bring up the tax deal until they were pretty far along in the legal process.  I think that Hatch has some kind of dirt on CBS/Burnett/Les and that is the only reason they haven't taken him to court and ruined him completely.
survivor,3dmtwz,joshj516,5,Fri Jul 17 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know, that kind of adds to the believability of what he's saying for me. He got his accountant to have both tax returns because he was expecting CBS to pay the taxes for him. His accountant would obviously be wondering why he would want to only know the tax return without the Survivor money, so he said he just wanted to compare them.  At the time, he probably was doing his best to be secretive about the whole thing. Of course he's not going to tell his accountant ""Well I caught someone cheating so I bargained for them to pay my taxes"""
survivor,3dmtwz,PHILtheCANADIAN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:59:39 2015 UTC,If you look at all the circumstantial evidence though he really has nothing to back up his story other than the fact that he caught them cheating and threatened to quit then kept playing.

Remember that the big reason Dirk got into a big debate with Hatch a few months ago when he last mentioned the Kelly sandwiches thing was because Hatch himself stayed silent during the Stillman lawsuit.
