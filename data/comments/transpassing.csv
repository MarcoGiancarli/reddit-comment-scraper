Skirts/dresses that hit at the waist and then flare out would be very flattering. Maybe even get a little petticoat to make them flare out a little more, it will make it look like you have bigger hips. I'd also look for jeans with a higher waistline-- hugs more curves that way and looks more feminine.   You look cute :) good luck!"

Think back to school there were always girls that bloomed before the rest and then other that it took ages for.  Many of them would have used various means to hide that they were not up at the same level as their friends.  The following is from a parent guide website ""Puberty doesn't happen all at once — it happens in stages. For example, a girl's breasts may start to grow, but she may not get her period until years later. You may continue to go through puberty changes until you're 20 years old. ""   ""Puberty can take several years, and usually happens between the ages of 9 and 17.""     Just keep going and keep the the lip up, as you said your a late bloomer."

transpassing,3dsgo6,laylakyn,4,Sun Jul 19 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"You have good bone structure, so there wouldn't be much you need to do. You'll want to clean up those eyebrows, learn some makeup techniques, and keep growing your hair out."
transpassing,3dsgo6,andynotandy,3,Sun Jul 19 11:02:52 2015 UTC,"You currently present as young male but your face is fairly soft so with a little work you could pass as female convincingly.  The main issue is your eyebrows; they're too thick and too straight, making your brow ridge more masculine. If you feel comfortable enough, work with a good stylist to thin them and shape them. After that, you'll be able to pluck strays as needed.   If you don't feel comfortable going to a stylist, check out the online beauty rags for articles on finding the best shape and thickness to suit your face.  The other thing is your current hairstyle; it still says male. Most women spend an inordinate amount of time on styling their 'do. Find a cut the not only enhances your features, but that also takes a little bit of work to maintain. Also, consider some highlights or other color treatment to give your hair movement and variety. This will make you look a bit more ""put together"".  If you are going to wear cosmetics, go easy. You're young so you don't need much. Enhance your eyes with brown or dark brown mascara, and give your lips just a hint of color.   For clothing, you'll need to minimize the width of your shoulders while giving the illusion of curvier hips. Don't go too big in the breast area because right now, to pass as female, you'll want to pass as a Tom-boyish, sporty girl. Smaller breasts would be expected on that body type.   Start slow with smaller changes, girls have had their whole lives to live as girls and cultivate the look. You're coming in with the slight disadvantage of having to learn it all quickly but with practice, you'll get it. So, start slow and as you get more confident, you can do more to feminize your overall look."

However, that can be fixed through standing straighter and weight loss. To emphasize your feminine figure, you can work to tone up your core, which would give you a slight ""hour-glass figure,"" which would do wonders.   However, we're very critical on this sub and want the best for others; honestly, I doubt anyone picks up anything on you, and everyone sees you as the woman that you are.

Your hair is so curly and puffy that it's not a ""gender"" look per-se, it's just a bad look.  Not trying to be mean, I swear.  Do something with that tho (I apologize for not knowing what besides maybe straightening it?).  Y'know, you're a very unique face.  Your lower half is very fem, but your top half is somewhat masculine.  Overall, you read as a boy to me, I'm sorry.  It's not just the hair; I covered your hair in the pic with my fingers (expert science trick) just to see your facial structure alone and still see a young boy.  But y'know... you're soooo friggin young that any issues now are going to be totally pointless once you're in your prime as a beautiful, young woman in the near future.

On point:   broad straps for a dress Pattern is ok, but try for something going vertical. Horizontal/diagonal patterns can make you look broader than you actually are.   Could use work:   The dress needs to come in around your waist, then flares out adding to your hips. Look for peplum, pleating, skater skirts or dresses or things that can belt at the waist.   Examples:  http://www.eeclothes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/07/0/189-Ali-Ro-women-s-grape-stretch-knit-cap-sleeve-crystal-neckline-flare-dress-1.jpg   shoes, I can't tell if you have a heel on them but try for a kitten heel or a neutral colour 3-4in pump, this will long line your leg and give a little umph to your booty and bust. Make sure the pump has an ankle strap for extra balance and control.   Examples:  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=103438811  Edit - Also the headband is cool but would suit longer hair, ever thought about looking into a lace front wig? if you're growing your hair out that is. It would also serve as something to protect your hair from damage as it grows out."

transpassing,3db59l,OllieHolla,12,Tue Jul 14 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"Howdy, brother.  I'd suggest a natural shade of hair color and less plaid.  Perhaps some black button-ups, unbuttoned with a plain shirt underneath.  To a non trans-savvy person, often dyed hair/piercings will read as ""punk"" or ""androgynous"" woman rather than male.  I'm speaking to this as I have been given the same advice before.  Let your brow thicken.  Maybe shorten your bangs?   I don't advocate changing your entire style/ wardrobe, so I hope I don't come off that way.  But to be read as more male, I think those things would help sway you. You're well on your way."

transpassing,3db59l,verifiedshitlord,5,Wed Jul 15 13:47:11 2015 UTC,The pink hair and piercing instantly says butch lesbian to me so I agree with the first commenter that going for a natural colour would probably help a lot. I think shortening your fringe'll help some too. I know it's the least easy thing to change but if you can try to lose some weight it'll help define your jawline more because right now you have a very round/circle face shape which is generally more feminine.
transpassing,3db59l,Cat_Butt_Face,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posters... the pink hair, piercing, and glasses scream ""edgy butch"" not man.

transpassing,3d8be0,unixbeardxd,4,Tue Jul 14 09:11:04 2015 UTC,"Color correction is quite difficult.  I don't know how much research you've done on the topic, but it's essentially finding a color that, when combined with a base color gives something close to your skin tone.  Some use red lipstick, some use orange tinted stuff, others can get away with just concealer.  What I have found works for me, at least until I find better is the following  powder blush applied to the beard/mustache area, translucent powder everywhere else.  I use a makeup sponge to press it in and then a fluffy brush to remove excess powder.    Apply a layer of foundation, then if the coverage isn't good enough, a concealer, then blend in.  Apply a second layer of powder to the whole face, pressing in, then using fluffy brush to remove excess.  After that's done, then I can do everything else.  I really should photograph my process, from pre-shave to finish and get feedback from MUA and maybe here."

Also work on your brow shape, the front of your brows dip down towards the corner of your eye, try to raise them up (I hope this is making sense I can try and find a pic if it doesn't of what I mean). Use a product such as Anastasia brow pomade or even just brown eyeshadow with an angled brush to play with the shape until you get the look you want. Takes a bit of practice."

I've done it before and I honestly think I look more girly, attractive, and helps to stand out less as trans when I don't use eyeliner on the bottom eyelid and only do mascara. The mascara gives off a slight shadow instead a bold line that - in my eyes - makes me look too ""racoon-y"" or takes away from my eyes natural beauty. Maybe next time I try doing it on the bottom eyelid I'll post a photo here to show you."

What I meant to say was that you /should/ continue the top line until it reaches your inner lid. Kinda like this.

transpassing,3d6zqh,RedditBlob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:52:48 2015 UTC,"Longer hair definitely! I'm 100% with you on that. Yea I kind of chose the wrong picture to post here. I wore a cute dress a day or two after this and didn't take a photo unfortunately. I totally thought I looked a lot more passable wearing the dress. I don't really enjoy exposing too much of my body because of its biological features that are still present. I'm slowly gaining confidence (and sometimes losing it all in a matter of seconds).   Thanks! I've never been a fan of lipstick, maybe because I've never tried it. Even before I came out and was still into dating women I never really like it on them or kissing them with it on. I think I still retained that opinion for my own makeup likings as a girl. I'll have to try some!"
transpassing,3d6zqh,Houston979,2,Sun Jul 19 11:40:30 2015 UTC,"It took me awhile to feel comfortable with exposing my chest/shoulders/collarbone. Layering goes a long way in balancing it out, and long hair helps create more of a flow from your head to your shoulders. I had owned some of my favorite shirts and sweaters for over a year before I liked the way they looked on me, and a big factor in it was my hair growing out (down past my shoulders now). I have a huge ribcage and it makes my torso look a lot thicker than it would otherwise, so tighter fitting clothes were just awkward before. Seriously, hair has made a huge difference (along with hormones making me way more feminine).   I don't use lipstick exactly, I alternate between lip stain and the more matte stuff NYX has. It's less creamy/doesn't smear as easily and you can apply it really lightly if you have a delicate hand, just to get some color without it being like a coat of paint that will come off on everything.   If you aren't crazy about it, though, you should try lip stain. It's like a magic marker for your lips, so it's more subtle. Cheap ones are okay but I'd recommend spending $5-$10 at least to get a better application. They can dry your lips out, so I usually put on chapstick over top of it. It'll also get you in the habit of keeping your lips moist and exfoliated, since the lip stain looks like shit on dried/cracked lips.  Hope some of this is helpful!  [Edit: additional thoughts] I can see you have a pretty slender frame, no super broad shoulders, etc. If you aren't comfortable in something super exposing like a camisole, you should really look at henleys and boatnecks. The space they open up below the neck goes a long way in aesthetic without making you feel like you're naked.   Example:  http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&pid=529028062  The buttons allow you to cover up more or to show more skin, so it's a nice balance."

transpassing,3d2sgf,claireKEK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"I think you look amazing! Also your eye makeup is really pretty =)  As for suggestions, are these just clip-ins? If they are I might recommend moving some up towards your face a little bit so they look a little more natural (so they're not all in the back). You could also try layering them a little so they aren't just all one length. Just make sure the stylist doesn't cut your actual hair if you ask for this because the point of extensions is to keep them in until you grow out your hair. It's really not too big of a deal though because your look right now is normal for some reason, but it would make them look less flat and less obvious (most people probably wouldn't notice, but for those that have worn extensions a lot it's pretty easy to tell that they are). Just something you could play with. Also having more will make them look less flat, especially if they are sorta distributed around your head and not just all in the back. Sometimes wind makes them show though, so if you live in a windy place probably finding a place where they are least likely to show is best, even if it doesn't look as good. I just usually wear a beanie in the winter to prevent this, but my hair is a little shorter so it's more likely to show so you're probably okay.  They also don't perfectly match color-wise, but it's okay cause that gives you a bit of a reverse Ombré look, which works good =).  If they are artificial hair, make sure to brush them out often, and probably get some brush like this because that will help prevent damage. Artificial hair tangles really easily so be careful in general with it. If they are real hair, make sure that the shampoo you have is not a kind that will damage them, and it will usually tell you on the package/a hair stylist can help as well, especially if you have tape-ins or glue-ins.  In general you'll want a sulfate free shampoo because sulfates suck out a lot of the moisture of the hair and damage them (the ""squeaky clean"" feel is actually really bad), something that conditioner can only help so much with. In general, even if they are clip ins you can sleep in them and everything, but that just might require some upkeep as eventually they will start falling out a little so you'll just want to check every morning or something, and maybe like once throughout the day. Once you can afford them I'd recommend tape-ins because clip-ins get really annoying fast.  As with hair in general, if you are using a straightner or curling iron, make sure to have some kind of heat protectant like this, something like this works really well (and it makes your hair look more shiny). Biosilk or coconut oil is also nice.  I've worn extensions daily for about a year now (clip-ins and then tape-ins) so if you have any more questions feel free to ask and I'd be happy to help.  PS: Please never get glue-ins they will eat your soul."

transpassing,3czu02,MBeecham,4,Sun Jul 12 07:33:53 2015 UTC,"I think the lower part of your face is the weaker part, I can see some bear shadow so I'd suggest trying a thicker more consistent foundation, your jaw is a little wide too so some tricky contouring on the sides might help distract away from that some. It looks like you're unsure about what eyebrow shape to go for too since they vary from photo to photo so I'd suggest letting them grow out and going to a brow bar and getting them professionally shaped at least once and then seeing how they look from there, brows are so important but people don't really think about them."

I think your hair and nose look more masculine, your eyes and lips look feminine, and your face shape and eyebrows are androgynous. The overall effect is very androgynous, but in a way that I think you could play up the appearance of either gender should you want to.   If you want to go more masculine, you could try /r/gainit and /r/fitness for advice on bulking up and becoming more muscular, which would help give you more jaw definition eventually, and that you should keep your hair short and continue growing your eyebrows out (perhaps try Latisse on them?). If you want to go more feminine, you could grow out your hair and add a bit of makeup (eyeliner, mascara, brow pencil or gel) to define your eyes and brows and possibly accentuate your lips. If you are genderfluid/androgynous, you're on the money."

transpassing,3ctdvn,Fishmongers,2,Sun Jul 12 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"i am actually in a similar conundrum. I have been letting my hair grow for the past year or so. I get it  trimmed every once and a while. I was getting the back of my hair  shortened so that it would match the sides (i had a little bit of a mullet thing going on) :P . I tell my stylist to straighten it, he uses a straightening brush+blowdryer and a flat iron. When he cuts it, he uses thinning shears to take away some of the bulk from the sides of my head.   I need to figure out what I am going to do at my next haircut ...  My every day routine is to use a round bristled brush to add volume to my hair. If i am super frizzy that day i put argan oil in my hair to help calm down the frizz. I typically use shampoo about once a week, conditioner about every other day."

transpassing,3cuwbr,Countdown2Control,8,Sat Jul 11 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"I feel weird judging others but I'll try and give good feedback hopefully. I'm female assigned at birth and ftm. Just as background.  I'd like to say that your body passes very well.  Your face does too. The light pinkish skin tone, your cheeks, and with that lipstick was great. It suits you. I barely believe you're pre everything.  Anyway, now with the criticism. The only thing that would tip me off that you were male assigned at birth would be the higher hairline. LOTS of cis girls also have those too even though it's seen a stereotypical ""male"" thing. There are ways of dealing and HRT will help with that if you choose to take hormones. It's not as noticeable with the way you do your hair compared to some other hairstyles. Props to you. Bangs are feminine to a lot of people. Some bangs are even more feminine looking on people depending on the shape of their face.   My sister and I have residing hair. Just genetics. We kinda style our hair to cover the hairline with brushed forward bangs, or a lower hanging parting to a side, and everything is pushed forward always. Again, it's basically push your bangs to cover more forehead. Your parting was really what made your hairline stick out in the second photo. You know play around a bit in the mirror with different ways to make up for a slightly raised hairline. Different bangs maybe or parting differently would help I think.  Hope this was useful in anyway."
transpassing,3cuwbr,Countdown2Control,3,Sat Jul 11 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I owe a lot to my super high metabolism. For some reason I've just had a really skinny build all my life, and I've never really put on weight despite how much I eat.   A friend helped me pick out a lot of the cosmetics bar the lipstick, which I picked up today just because I liked the colour. I'm pretty bad at applying makeup, so I didn't attempt any eyeliner. Had no idea what it would all look like on me, so it's endearing to hear your kind words :)  Your tips about my hairline are well noted. I'll mess around a bit and see what I can come up with!  Regarding length, should/can I get it trimmed at all? I've just sort of been growing it with no attendance the last year and half. I hear that's not a great way to treat it.  But thank you once more, was just a big boost in confidence to read all this, thanks ^"
transpassing,3cuwbr,mygoddamnameistaken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, trimming is good for hair. You can't just let it grow randomly. (Experience from 2 years of pure growth). Split ends, uneven growth, and general lopsidedness. You're definitely not at THAT point now. If you feel that creeping in, get a trim.  I'd keep it at this general length or more though. If I was going for an even more fem look. Trimming a centimeter or 2 won't hurt at all though. If you really feel it's time for a trim. Get trim. And the stylist can totally help you out if you go to one and found a supportive one. That's hard though I understand. I don't even think you need a trim.  By the way, girl. I know how it feels to not give yourself any credit because of fixation on the ""wrong"" parts of yourself constantly. I still do. I like pointing the good out too now. You know, credit where credit is due.  Good luck with everything."

transpassing,3cw5d2,stephanyc83,3,Sat Jul 11 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"I’m an OC ally, so if my advice isn’t welcome please tell me so and I’ll delete my comment. Here’s my feedback.   You’re not quite passing, but you’re also not far off. The second picture is the best of the bunch and really shows you off to best effect because it diminishes the problems I see. I’ll start with those cons then move on to the pros.  Cons:    the wig is obviously a wig due to the lack of part, the way the bangs fall in an unnatural-looking way, and the unnatural looking sheen on the hair. Investing in a higher quality wig or (preferably) getting a weave/extensions put in by a pro will really help you out here.  The eyebrows. Good news is these are easily fixable and will REALLY feminize your face (never EVER underestimate the power of a well-shaped brow!). More good news is that you have a very lovely eyebrow shape and natural arch. You will want to trim the tops of the eyebrows towards the midline of your face so they don’t “rise above” the meat of the brow. Then you will want to tweeze below your brow to follow along your natural arch. I drew over your picture a guide for you to follow if you’re unsure where to start with your brows. As you can see, the trick is to emphasize the natural shape of your brow (you have a very nice arch, by the way) and clear away the extra hairs around it, not make a whole new shape. If you’ve never tweezed before, err on the conservative side and remember to step back and analyze your work as you go—it might be easy to overtweeze an area if you’re too close to the mirror. Most of your tweezing should be beneath the brow; above it, only tweeze to clear up stray hairs. On the first picture of this, I drew orange arrows on your brow to show you the shape you should be aiming for with the tweezing. Some slight shadow over your upper lip. Not too noticeable, but an easily fixed point. Width of your nose bridge. This is not a truly necessary thing to pass, it’s more that it may help feminize your face when paired along with a few other makeup tweaks. You can find some contouring help over at /r/makeupaddiction, but the gist is to find a foundation highlight (maybe one shade lighter than yoru skin tone) for the bridge of your nose, and a slightly darker shade (perhaps 1-2 shades darker than your skin tone) along the sides of your nose. Then blend, and dust some loose powder over top with a large powder brush to set. See picture two of this link to see what I'm talking about here and in the next points about contouring/highlighting  Shape of your jaw. Like the nose bridge, this is more about feminizing tweaks than truly necessary changes. I think you have a nice jaw shape, and that using contouring to soften it slightly could help. I would use the darker shade of foundation I mentioned to round out the corner and to contour cheekbones at an angle that gives your face a heart-shape (start at the side of your face around your mid-ear, just below your jaw bone, draw a line with the darker foundation down to your jaw along the line of the nasolabial fold where it curves around your mouth toward your jaw.) Getting the contouring down may take a little time and practice, but that’s okay. [See purple lines in the second picture I attached for areas of darker contour I’m talking about; white lines are where you should highlight. You can use a lighter shade of foundation to highlight the bridge of your nose, and a powder highlighter for under your brow bone, over the top of your cheekbone, your cupid’s bow, and the inner corner of your eye.]    Pros:   You have lovely full lips with a very distinctive cupid’s bow. I think this is one of your best features (reminds me of Rihanna) and something you should play up! Highlighting your cupid’s bow with a highlighter (white or light taupe eyeshadow may work in a pinch, but you can also find powder highlighters in any makeup section) would look very pretty, I think! You don’t have a noticeable “overhanging brow” which is problem not so easily fixed, and is a huge point in your favor in terms of the femininity of your face. You have what look like natural, dark, long eyelashes, which is awesome. Along with your lips your eyes are your best feature. I already noted that you havea  nice eyebrow shape but your eye shape is also great (eyes are a nice size and not too close or far apart). You look like you may be using a tiny bit of eyeliner on your bottom lash line. I would also recommend a bit on top (I think the most easy way to do this if you’re not  a makeup proficient is to use an angled eyeliner brush with some black powder eyeshadow. You can “clean up” with a wet Q-tip if you mess up. Start at the mid-eye and follow the lashline to the outer corner, flick it just a tiny bit out, then go back to the mid-eye and bring the line in slightly towards the inner corner, making it thinner as you go.) Mascara and an eyelash curler will also be very good friends! (Note: eyelash curlers are a bit hard to get used to, and will work easier if you heat it first with a blowdryer and start the clamp at your mid-lash)   I hope this is helpful and not too overwhelming. I think you’re very pretty! Good luck. :)"

transpassing,3cu0zz,teenytrash,10,Fri Jul 10 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Not the best picture to judge from but from what I'm seeing, you're really pretty.  I wish I had your courage when I was your age.  I don't know you or your situation but I know how scary reaching out, even online, can be as a teenager.  My own experience with that helped to keep me in the closet for another 15 years.  I don't really know how other current communities are but when I first tried reaching out, and some subsequent attempts, I ran into a lot of creeps and that really messed with me and sent me further into denial and further instilled shame.  I can't say I've run into a single person through the trans subreddits though that has been anything other than understanding, kind, and supportive and nobody who has struck me as ""creepy"" (so far!  fingers crossed!).    Some of my most vivid memories of reaching out online as a teenager involved grown men asking me my age and when I would reply ""15"" or ""16"" or however old I was, they would proceed to ask me sexual things.  Again, I don't know how things are outside of Reddit but I know how that can screw with you at such a young age (or at any age because that's creepy as hell!).  What those grown men attempted to do back then was wrong and I knew it was wrong then but still it made me feel wrong too.  I don't really know how easy it is today to run into that particular shit when you're just looking for guidance and support but I am aware of some of what you can run into out there in the wild west that is the internet and a lot of it can make you feel really icky; it can make you think so negatively of yourself.  I'm 29, pre-everything and even with such a supportive community here on Reddit, it's still scary, but I know how scary this is at 14 (and I never even posted a picture of myself!) but I just want you to know that you aren't wrong and that you're beautiful and that no matter the bullshit you might read on the internet or see on TV or hear at school or from your parents, and no matter your situation or circumstances, whether you eventually transition or not, who you are isn't wrong and please don't ever let anybody ever make you feel like you are as I did so many times and for so long.  And I think this is a good message for anybody of any age who's trying to deal with all this but I know how scary and disconcerting all this can be for a 14 year old and I know how hard it can be to find other trans girls your own age to speak with and how hard that can be too.  I shouldn't have to say any of this but society at large is still not quite on our side and that can beat you down pretty hard.

Slip the hose through the jeans like so  and then place your feet through the ""legs"" of the gaff. Tuck as usual and voilà!"

I guess you can basically use a cylinder of any material for the part that holds your thing in.  But no matter what I use, I can never get it to stay. If I pull it really high it can hold for walking but if I bend my knees in any way it comes out, then rolls down to where it is visible. Makes it hard to use stairs or sit.

transpassing,3cpz98,Nina1701,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:28 2015 UTC,this is like the 6th time I did it. Its just a smoky eye. or at least an attempt at it. basically my goal is to not look like I have dark circles. and to blend every thing.
transpassing,3cpz98,adulaire,3,Thu Jul 9 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"Like you, I have deep set eyes. Also like you (I'm sure), I love the smokey eye look. I've seen a few eye tips that say smokey eyes and deep set eyes don't mix, they make the deepness deeper which in turn makes us look less feminine. I've taken this to heart and found tutorials that do the opposite, make our eyes pop. I think the results are pretty dramatic. Just something to think about.   Do you read makeup tutorials at all?  Edited for better wording"

You look great in the pics, but in the last one your stance is rather revealing. Nothing bad, might just be the angle. Your makeup is nice and if you want to inprove there are sooo many tutorials.  Are you there yet? Depends to be honest. Summer makes passing a lot harder because you can't hide arm and shoulder muscles. I think you are doing quite nicely. Try on other outfits maybe and take more pics if you have doubts. I am really amazed though. You're really pretty :)"

I am not showing anything that I shouldn't. can you be less vague?  also thanks, I keep getting told I am pretty. I just might start to believe it. And my legs are from years of treading water polo and lifeguarding. Also I tend to walk about between 4-9 miles daily.   my shoulders are going to be around a few more years, I have a feeling. But a lot went away in the last 6 months. So I am ok with it. I just need to work on losing weight.  this is from my first time out at pride this year. http://imgur.com/a/4nPkL  and here's me trying on the dress. last week. http://i.imgur.com/YhvTYSH.jpg I am trying out for extra acting work.   this is me a few years ago. with my little sis.http://imgur.com/MFqhVSt Edit no make up!  and I have been watching tutorials. but for me right now it about learning what not to do."

I still haven't stated transition in any noticeable way, so my family can't insult me about it yet.  Its a shame people get so upset over something that really shouldn't affect them at all.    Your lifestyle sounds much healthier than mine, I try to incorporate more walking/biking into my routine, but I get lazy quickly.  I'm also big fan of beer, so that's probably where my stomach fat comes from.

Because, I was to less feminine to their. And I still love survival and other things and I'm still me. But my transition is a hell and  it's long, almost 3 years. And first 13,5 months on HRT.

I've noticed the same thing for myself. Face softening started in the eyes and then gradually moved down. It's entirely conjecture, but I think facial hair also plays a role - even when you shave, there are large roots under the skin that change the shape of the face - especially thickening the upper lip.

I am considering transition, myself."
transpassing,3c245x,mickelle1,5,Sat Jul 4 13:35:13 2015 UTC,"I struggle with things I cannot change or control. My lack of a female youth, that I can't ever carry a baby, etc. I try hard not to focus on things I can't change, but honestly they sometimes make me feel sad, and probably always will. Most of all I think it would just feel nice to not have to think about my gender, to just feel 100% confident that others perceive my gender as I want them to. Some days I feel grateful for my transness,  and lucky to have experienced life in both genders. I'll be honest in saying that it does get tiring at times as well. Through it all though, I'm very blessed and my joys far outweigh my difficulties. For me, there is nothing better than being able to live my life on my terms, for myself, in honesty and truth, always striving to get better."

For me, I don't want children but it would have been nice to have had a female upbringing and such. I am also quite concerned about at least being seen by others in such a way that doesn't make life harder than it needs to be.   In the end, I am very glad things have turned out the way they did (being assigned male at birth and possibly transitioning soon). Though I really wish I were born with a different body and gender, and that has been a real struggle, I have so many other huge, positive things in my life that might not be so, had I been assigned female at birth.  I'm so glad to hear things have gone well for you. I'm sure life will keep getting better and better! Perseverance and positivity are key."

transpassing,3c2sh3,redvelvetmock,2,Sat Jul 4 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"Based purely on the face/angle shown here, the only red flag for me is the hair. I picked out that it was a wig at first glance, which is fine if that doesn't bother you, but a color that's more believably natural with your skin tone would probably make it less immediately obvious that it's a wig. I know quality wigs can be expensive, though.  I can't 100% tell if you're wearing makeup or not in this photo.  If you are, is a sign that you've nailed the ""natural look"". If you're not, it's a sign that you have excellent skin/coloring."

You can try a bunch of different things, what works will depend on your hair type, the easiest thing is to deep condition, you can also try using product like anti-frizz serum, blow drying can also help a lot.

transpassing,3c1enu,LikeGoldAndFaceted,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely need to de-frizz/deep condition. NEVER brush curly hair dry either. After it is washed (natural, unscented shampoo with coconut oil/argon oils) get a good conditioner, condition it thoroughly. Let it sit a while, the use a shower comb to slowly detangle. Shower combs have huge, wide teeth so they dont tear hair. Let it air dry a little bit, and/or lay it in a towel, dont twist wrap it, and fold over. An offset part will do wonders. Part at your highest brown ridge. Looks the best. Middle parts are not for everyone. Hope this helps a tad :)"

Your jawline is a bit masculine, but the rest of you already screams female, so you don't have a TON of work to do. Watch some Youtube videos on contouring your face with makeup.  As the HRT (Estradiol) takes effect, your face will round out a bit, and that'll become less necessary over time."

Third, it appears like you do not possess some of the very masculine facial features that can make passing more difficult. Features like a pronounced brow ridge and large square jaw are things that HRT can't fix. For that there is facial femininezation surgery (ffs).   Fourth, the good news and bad news is that you seem to have light hair. That makes beard shadow less noticeable but also makes you ineligible for laser hair removal. You are stuck with electrolysis or less hi-tech hair removal techniques.   Finally in my opinion, from your one picture, It's my guess that you will be super cute :-) ymmv"

I'd go to a salon to have someone use one of their hair restoring thingies (don't ask me for names @__@) so that they can bring it back to life! And I think that having a softer, more flattering haircut/style is a must. The one you're currently sporting really makes your face look angular and makes your forehead pop out. You don't want that.

transpassing,3bfwwm,annbelle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:22:41 2015 UTC,It looks like you need to condition your hair more or use heat protectant before you straighten or you might have dry hair and need an oil like morrocan oil to run through the ends only. I recommend getting your eyebrows done. Also if you dress more feminine people will most likely perceive you as female. I recommend wearing shirts not so tight on the neck. You are close to passing though!

What I learned is take a pencil or a pen, line it up with the edge of your nostril and the outer corner of your eye and pluck to there.  Then from the nostril to the inner corner and pluck to there.  Then shape by plucking in rows from the bottom and then trim the top if need be.  Either way, you still look very feminine and even if you don't ""fix"" your eyebrows, they're still not overtly masculine.

Fried, yellow blonde looks good on no one.  Try Wella T18 from Sally's beauty.  Mix with 10 volume developer, wait ~20 min, wash out.  Your hair will be much more silvery/white ish blonde.  Also a conditioning treatment (a super cheap deep conditioner is aussie brand ""x3 moisture"") and a hair straightener will make your hair look and feel a bagillion times better."

You've got a lot of rogue boobage escaping out the sides there. D: (It's a common issue, especially with us broader-chested ladies.)  If you're not sure what I'm talking about, here's a picture: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d6/2c/82/d62c82c88b6aecb64ac7fddf082bad42.jpg   Easy to fix, though. Next time you go shopping, try on your bra's ""sister sizes""- bras that are up a cup size, but down a band size from where your current one is. Sooner or later, you'll find one that's still a nice snug fit, but keeps them from escaping out the sides like that.  eg. 38B --> 36C --> 34D --> 32DD --> etc  There's a chart for it here, if you have trouble. http://www.brasize.com/bra-sister-size.html  Best of luck! You're looking great."

You can probably try almost any volumizing product especially ones meant to create waves though :) personally I like all-natural hair products if I'm going to leave them in because they smell nicer and are kinder to hair but it's whatever!  as for dry shampoo, I've always used Batiste's floral one, but you might just want to look at their whole line and see if any of the scents appeal to you more. They also make tinted dry shampoos which would probably be better for beginners (you would be looking at their medium brunette - not dark brunette - shade if that's the route you wanted to go; you can find it on Amazon but I haven't seen it in stores) :)"

transpassing,3b05qc,150max,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"As far as your face, I think shaping your eyebrows and wearing a little lip makeup would be the two biggest ones. You might also contour your chin with makeup if you were up for a little challenge, but really, I think you have an overall feminine face - your jawline doesn't seem very masculine, your hairline is already hidden by your bangs, and it doesn't even seem that you have facial hair yet (is that right?). And remember, if necessary, to work on trying to adopt some feminine mannerisms and have a feminine voice - some people can pass 100% in photos but not at all in person for those reasons."

transpassing,3aydkd,LikeGoldAndFaceted,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because you aren't on hormones, they will more than likely make a huge difference, most of your clothes also don't look very feminine. You look good for pre-hrt, but you look androgynous leaning male. For right now a different hair cut could make a big difference, the style it's in now is a big male cue for me, I also personally don't like that giant hat. I definitely don't think you look bad or anything, you just look like you aren't on HRT yet."

transpassing,3aydkd,LaoiseFitz,3,Wed Jun 24 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what would work best with you facial structure, but I like how it frames your face best in the first picture. The main thing would be to control it a bit more. Control the waves and frizz, deep condition, get a good trim and some layers, learn to use product like texture paste and stuff. Shiny, healthy looking hair is always more feminine. If you don't know about it already /r/fancyfollicles is a good place to look for hair style ideas."

Maybe it was the light or something? I think hormones might help if you have enough fat to rearrange on your face, and maybe contouring might help until then"

Anyone reading this, don't cut your hair if you are questioning mtf!! The worst that can happen is you are a guy with long hair."
transpassing,3avoce,Indie123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:44:31 2015 UTC,Guess I'll just have to wait and grow it out again :( I agree tho. Don't cut your hair if you don't have to. Or else you will be waiting a loooong time for it to grow back. Grrr... Lesson learned. This boy-mode/girl-mode lifestyle is hard yo

My voice... err, it depends. :/ IRL, most people don't seem to bat an eye and I get ma'am'd most of the time. I'm told it's passable because I'm tall and because my vocal mannerisms are feminine.

transpassing,3alv7n,DeadDollKitty,2,Sun Jun 21 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, it was pretty traumatizing for me to try on swimsuits, especially because of that pesky lower part. I ended up going with 3 layers of things: A homemade gaff (that moved out of position as I touched the water), some boxer-type swim trunks that were very snug, and the bottom you can see in the photo, which is a women's one. I was still anxious and ever aware of looking out to not show bulge, but that's really the best I can do.  I sometimes get said by my friends that I have balls of steel (hope that doesn't complicate SRS), and that might be true as I usually try to push myself in front of whatever comes my way. Doesn't make it less terrifying the first time, but it gets better. After presenting female without HRT for so long, I'm quite happy to present female with the start of subtle changes."

I never really do a feminine voice myself, but it doesn't bother me. Pair that with the width of my shoulders, the size of my triceps, and the size of my nose, that altogether, work against me, more than any one thing.  I just know when one of my trans friends told me about my eyebrows, I really started to focus on them because it was one of the tells I had full control over. Half a millimeter makes a world of difference, just like plastic surgeons say their work deals in millimeters. So it's usually the tip I try to share with others. Also practice smiling with one's eyes.  Never do anything you don't want to and don't listen to the negative people or the naysayers.

If you cover the lower portion of your face, the top half looks very natural.  Covering the top half, it looks like you could stand to gain a little weight to fill your cheeks out more.  With the HRT doing its job, you may end up not minding your jaw - the muscles will lessen, and the rest of your face should fill out a little bit and look softer.

transpassing,3ajbay,autumnnora,6,Sat Jun 20 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"In the first picture, with your hair (more or less) pulled back, you appear androgynous, leaning toward feminine. It's tough for me to put my finger on why I feel that way, though. I think it might be because of your acne scars on your chin/jaw drawing unnecessary emphasis to the area. Nothing makeup can't fix though!  In the 2nd pic, I would say the combo of the long hair + smile makes you pass quite well! (You really do have quite a nice smile :D)  As far as brows are concerned, they are rather bushy, but that's good because you have lots of starting material if you want to wax/thread them! (I like threading, personally.) ~$10 and 10 minutes at a 'brow bar' will take care of that issue, and then you can maintain the look with  tweezers. I think doing your brows would add to your look and make you look even more feminine :)  Overall, I'd say you could 'make it' fulltime."

Though I too have acne scars, my skintype/tone are pretty different from yours, so my acne problems are mostly with hyperpigmentation. Generally speaking though, try experimenting with different foundations and concealers to find out what works for you.  If I were you, I would check out /r/skincareaddiction and /r/makeupaddiction for ways to both improve the tone of your skin, and tricks on hiding blemishes. For more instant-gratification, I would also check out a Sephora/Ulta/Nordstroms and ask one of the stylists there for makeup tips--you'll get a makeover, and they'll point you to products specifically for your issues :)"

And if you'd like, you can purchase a highlighter or just some eyeshadow in a light warm hue or white, and put it under the arch of your eyebrow - it'll make your browbone look much higher, which is more feminine :)"

transpassing,3ahbt1,lifeofacoward,5,Sat Jun 20 12:07:23 2015 UTC,"I like your face a lot. It's just appealing to me. You are pretty but also interesting-looking. You completely pass to me. I think I wold be surprised (and envious, lol) if you told me you were trans ."
transpassing,3ahbt1,kpatable,4,Sat Jun 20 10:01:05 2015 UTC,"I think you pass pretty well overall from the 4th photo down. In the first few photos, it looks like you have a bit of shadow of facial hair above your upper lip, which is probably the most obvious thing to passerby. I know some trans girls swear by using a warm-tinted concealer or color corrector under foundation to hide that, since the warm tone of the makeup and the cool tone of the hair under the skin cancel each other out, but in my personal experience, a high-quality smoothing primer and a high-quality high-coverage foundation have always done just fine.   Other people have commented about your hairline. I don't think it alone would stop you from passing, but it might be one of those little things that, when added up with all the other little things, make it harder for you to pass. It might help if you cut your hair to have soft, feathered, wispy bangs across your forehead rather than side-swept longer bangs. (I emphasize the soft part because a perfectly straight line of bangs across a forehead makes the face look more angular, which is masculine.)   Two other super minor things are that your chin looks masculine, but not so much so that it couldn't be feminized with a little easy contouring. And a little lip gloss in a bright or neutral color would go a long way to making your lips seem plumper and thus more feminine. But these aren't really big things.   I hope this is helpful!"
transpassing,3ahbt1,adulaire,4,Sat Jun 20 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"You should be careful about your hairline. I don't think you should have your hair up like that, it definitely pings a bit ""off"".  I think you would pass at a glance but your jaw is a bit masculine."
transpassing,3ahbt1,furfrouever,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:47:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I am fine with my jaw many women have square jaws, and even with ffs,  i wouldn't change it (thats just a matter of preference though).

I like how your hair is, but yes, ponytail should be avoided, the first picture was not very passing imo.  The last picture is really cute too.  I see what others mean about the hairline but for me it was the lip and jaw and wide, square forehead that were the biggest things.

What I'm about to tell you I'm sure you already know, but here's some more reaffirmation:  -Obviously more weight loss helps anyone look better in general, so keep that up.   -Beard shadow is still obvious, but I know you're still working on that.  -Hair being longer will help shape your face.   -Your boobs here http://i.imgur.com/UY61NWY.jpg and here http://i.imgur.com/HJcmKBD.jpg and here http://i.imgur.com/N0VVbAf.jpg look off. I think the issue is your shirts are tucked too tight, so your boobs basically pitch a tent, making the boobs look unnatural, without weight to them. Try loosening the tuck so that the shirt curves over and under the boobs, helping to define them, like the swim suit http://i.imgur.com/G6yZDsu.jpg and the dress http://i.imgur.com/nHL4FBr.jpg do  -Your right eye brow is on point, looks fantastic, but the leftone looks a little off. The right curves around your eye, making it look bigger and rounder, the left one looks straight with a sharp angle. The only reason I mention this is because it causes me to look at your face longer and I started to pick apart features.  -Your posture seems good and relaxed  -Your fashion continues to get better"

transpassing,3ahgyh,summer_d,2,Sat Jun 20 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to add to the great suggestions /u/April41 gave :)  Your eyebrows actually look a bit unnaturally dark to me. If you fill them in with a pencil, try a shade or two lighter.   If you pluck your eyebrows, once you're done shaping them, use your finger to kind of forcefully comb your eyebrow hair upwards so that a lot of the hair makes little vertical lines sticking up above your eyebrow, then use tiny cosmetic scissors to cut the stray hairs so that the top line of your brow looks straight, smooth, and defined. Then use your finger to push all the hair downwards towards your eye, and cut along the bottom (be careful around the arch!) This will make your brows look a lot tidier.   For the facial hair shadow, try a high-quality smoothing silicone primer over your whole face, then a bit of blended orange or yellow tinted correcting concealer over where there's shadow, then a high-quality maximum-coverage foundation matched to your skin tone over your whole face.   Deep and dark lip colors create an illusion of thinner lips, which is a masculine trait. Try bright, light, or neutral shades, with generous gloss and maybe even a bit of fun shimmer :)  Properly applied eyeshadow could make your eyes look much more open and your browbone look higher. Get a palette of neutral (brown- to cream-hued) eyeshadows and try applying them in this kind of pattern using a decent brush (you'll have to mentally match up the colors you have to the ones in that picture according to relative lightness and darkness, I couldn't find a similar tutorial with natural colors.) Then use mascara. You could also try applying white eyeliner or using an eyelash curler for even more of an effect."

transpassing,3aax7p,littlemissfuzzy,2,Thu Jun 18 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"Oh okie dokie. It looked like hair shadow is why I asked. If its a dark red, like from the electrolysis, I suggest taking it slow and give your upper lip area a break for a while. Too much can leave scarring if you are not careful. Which one did you get, and how bad is it too use? And the pain?"
transpassing,3aax7p,whompalicious,2,Thu Jun 18 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have the box anymore and the brand name isnt on the product. It is like a pen with a cord attached to the base which isn't much bigger than the pen and there is a dial.  I havent used it in a while, my upper lip has always been like that, I just hadn't noticed until I started dressing. Even when I shave, its just discolored. Its a bummer.  The kit itself, you get this little tiny metal rod from the tip, and you put it into the hair. Then you touch the metal part of the pen with your finger dipped in salt water. It can hurt pretty good some times, others it just tickles. But you have to hold it for 15 seconds. Then pull it out. Sometimes it can get painful."
transpassing,3aax7p,Ashonym,3,Thu Jun 18 22:01:51 2015 UTC,"Jeeeeebus! 15 seconds! Most likely the discoloring is hair shadow from the hairs under the skin. Keeping up the electro is all you can really do until it is all gone. Of course, you can get some dermablend and foundation to cover it also. An orange-ish lip stick applied to it can help offset the blues from the hair ad well. Just takes time and practice :) I had it too before electro got 80% of it."

Unfortunately, they won't grow closer to each other. I get a few hairs, but not enough to make it look normal. I have been using a eyebrow pencil, but I just got in dipbrow, brow gel, yesterday so I am going to try that. I am learning to contour, but one day it is on fleek and the next is like I am a 5 year old using makeup for the first time. Once again, thanks!"

If you're having trouble passing, however, it is probably because you're clearly putting a lot of effort into trying to pass.  If you're insecure about yourself when you're out and about, insecure or nervous mannerisms are often read as ""feminine"" (because society is shitty and sexist) and might be tipping the scales against you.  Plus, I don't know how old you actually are, but you look young. 14-18 years old. If you're a grown man, doing grown man shit like working at a job (especially during school hours) or drinking at bars, people are more likely to peg you as female, just because you're obviously not a teenage boy.  Again, if you are a teenager, then bravo. You're spot on. But if you're looking to pass as a grown man, the way you look and dress is actually hurting you rather than helping."

transpassing,39t21e,LuminousBubble,4,Sun Jun 14 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"Going to a hairdresser once a month seems like a lot. Cutting your hair doesn't make it grow faster, you'll have shorter hair. If you really want to grow it out you should only cut it when you start to get split ends. I haven't been to the hairdresser in like 5 months and nope it doesn't have much shape left.. But it's still healthy and I'm not going to cut it until it's starting to split.

Your chin is a bit masculine, but I think your hair style needs a bit of work. You have pretty hair, but the bangs don't work well for your facial features. Having more defined and less big bangs piled on your head would help. Some soft bangs hanging down would shorten your face and lessen the impact of your jaw."

transpassing,39fy3h,aria22,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one who originally said that, but here's some tips from me :)  Tank tops and camisoles tend to look great with skirts, and so do some types of shirts (with more feminine embellishments/details). I must admit though I'm not very good yet myself at matching tops with skirts.. But I'm okay at matching colours.  I think the colour of your current top doesn't look very good with the skirt. Maybe burgundy red, pink, black, or a dark green would look good with it :) You could also try a patterned top, that might look good :) Also try tucking your top out of your skirt, it gives a different look :) Sometimes I find it looks better to tuck your top in, but sometimes it looks cuter to have it untucked and hanging over the skirt :)  Hope it helped a bit :3"

transpassing,39awnm,chris2lisa,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:48:12 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I don't really care too much about the muscles. I mean plenty of girls have some built arms. It's also not a terribly unhealthy thing to have either. I also recall hormones made my arms seem a lot less masculine back when I was on them.

transpassing,39a1xz,VanillaMoonPie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:10:47 2015 UTC,You have an adorable face. You need to focus on two things: your hairline and your eyebrows. Trim and style the brows. And either style your hair differently so it hides the male pattern hairline or wear a wig. And you'll be gorgeous. :)

transpassing,393l7a,Courtney1Yeah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"You should not worry, here's why:   You are still developing, at 17 years old your Testosterone (some features) hasn't cause a full male transformation... to full maturity etc.. Your facial bone structure isn't as rigidly define as male You haven't taken HRT. Don't under-estimate the power of hormones, they wouldn't change bone structure much but they will influence a lot of physical changes like fat distribution, soft skin, tights,  muscle mass etc... Did I mention you are 17? :) If someone at age 50-60(http://www.mamamia.com.au/social/cate-mcgregor/) can you look good... you have a lot of time to change..physically speaking. From appearance, genetically speaking you LOOK cute... which helps, i.e. I wish I look as cute :) Worrying won't help. It takes HRT, time, effort, learning and sometimes emotional support... and OH the big one genetics.. Tip: keep fit and healthy, a lot of people have notice once on HRT they gain weight rapidly, I have noticed this too.   All the points above are my own personal opinion, hope this have help somehow. Please note, everyone is uniquely different so the changes will vary according to each one.  I suggest you go and see a medical doctor who is experience in this field and discuss any physical or psychological concerns or issues you have, because it helps to get someone who's train to point you in the right direction.  My sincere best wishes on your journey :).  p.s. don't worry :)"

transpassing,392e68,warmerbread,7,Mon Jun 8 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"So let me tell you a story of what happened to me this weekend. It's the first weekend of the TT here on the Isle of Man and I was required to get a bus that passes the Grandstand (The number 1 attraction for tourists during this fortnight). The bus was full of foreign tourists so I was admittedly terrified of getting on since I'm full time but I rushed out with no time to shave or do make-up.   I had to climb up to the second tier of the bus and walk past 20 or so foreign people. When I did sit down I did so facing the window so that I'd attract as little attention as possible. However as so much attention was being attracted by the kids playing loud music behind me this was futile.  So one of the foreigners turned around and told them to turn it off since it was explicit and there was an elderly lady sat close by. ""Can you turn that explicit music off there's a lady here!"" give the foreigner a couple of seconds to look around and he notices me looking up at this point out of curiosity ""No wait two ladies."" and I couldn't help but smile. None of his friends, drunk or otherwise even attempted to argue, I was two seats away and he had a direct line of sight. I was sure I had visible stubble.  I stress the foreign part so much since the people who live here are mostly reserved and don't care to get involved with other peoples business, so a bus ride isn't a big deal for me.   Basically, I dressed and acted the appropriate ways to illicit the appropriate response. It was a 40 minute bus ride in close proximity to people who I'm sure would normally voice these kinds of things. If they went off and talked about it between themselves later I don't care."

Shorter hair is less important. I think your haircut is really cute, so that depends if ""cute"" is what you're going for. Curious about your sexual orientation though, cause if I didn't know you were FtM I could easily think you're just a really cute, feminine-ish gay boy. Cute haircut + overall cuteness/""gentle boy"" demeanor + nose stud = super cute gay guy imo"

transpassing,38qinh,drea14,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"You can have a girly haircut even when short.  Although, it really sucks that you're being forced to.  I cut off a below-shoulder-length mass of hair when my best friend died last year because I felt like I looked like a drowned rat . . .  I so wish I hadn't.   I'm just now getting it back!"
transpassing,38qinh,drea14,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the rest of my family doesn't know I'm trans. HAving it long without it being a very feminine hairstyle is the closest I can get to it before coming out to my family, which I will when the time is right"
transpassing,38qinh,drea14,2,Sat Jun 6 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"I'd hoped to already be on hormones for a few months now, since the process here in Denmark is supposedly very easy. I haven't found a place that goes into detail about it yet though.  The problem is that my mom was the one that had to book therapy sessions, because I'm under 18. Well she did, and three times in a row she had to cancel it, because she was tired. Now she straight up refuses it saying that I have to not get anymore sick days at my school. It's incredibly frustrating...  Luckily I turn 18 in October, and I can then book my own therapy sessions, at a therapist that isn't a high school therapist."

Your body is going to be very flexible.  Your chin is not very square, your eyes and lips already look fine.  The hormones will help out your cheeks and soften everything else.  That anxiety is just your dysphoria speaking.  I am 45.  I was worried I'd look like Arnold Schwarza-woman.    Do NOT get yourself down.  You have a fabulous life in front of you.    For comparison, I just happen to have a pic of myself at 17 . . . and then almost 30 years later as I transitioned.  You have SUCH an advantage over me. Here it is  And here I am this week"
transpassing,38qinh,VanillaMoonPie,2,Sat Jun 6 00:21:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much :)  That gave me a bit more courage! Although, I am not going through puberty anymore. I hit puberty when I was 9, and I have looked pretty much the same since I was 14, so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't look that much more masculine later in life if I don't start on hormones immediately.  I guess the thing I'm mostly concerned about is my voice, which has been described as ""deep and soothing"". I guess I'll have to see a voice coach.."
transpassing,38qinh,VanillaMoonPie,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"Speak more softly, put your voice in your face more, and listen to feminine speech patterns.  I know a girl whose voice CHANGED when she started at 21, and mine actually got a little higher to my incredible surprise.  There's nothing wrong with being an alto honey.  But yeah, a voice coach can help and there is surgery that a friend of mine had that can do wonders.  I would get a little ways into it before going so far, however . . .   And, the body is weird; I didn't get chest hair until I was 30-ish.  Hormone levels continue to change throughout your life . . . but you're going to at least stop the damage quite early.  Good luck and I hope to see your girl pictures on here someday soon!"

But other than, just over all progress has finally been going much much better. In the 9 months prior to starting injections, I went from 1mg, to 2, to 3 of oral tablets. And in that time I had seen almost no results whatsoever. Now my skin is softening again, and breasts are finally growing, fat distribution etc. The injection itself doesn't really hurt that bad. The only thing is Estradiol Valerate is really thick. So if you don't want to use a huge needle, you have to push down on the plunger kinda hard for a bit. But it's worth it, like I said!"

(Except that hat in the last photo is kind of swallowing your head. :P)  In terms of looking older, I think that bulking up a bit, being on T longer, and eventually growing facial hair if/when you can could help.    Fashion is also something that can change the age your perceived to be.  Pay attention to what guys your age and a few years older wear and copy ideas you like.  Opt for solid coloured pants and shorts over camo ones.  Consider getting some smart casual clothes.  Get some nicer shoes than sneakers if you don't have any.  I think even a dressier watch would go a long way in ageing you. :)"

Also don't cock your mouth to the side in selfies, that's definitely a feminine thing to do. Men hold their chin up and out a little, which is a challenging look, as in, come at me bro. Raising your chin will help a lot. Also your haircut is pretty andro so there's some room for definite easy improvement there. Your tees are great but I would avoid that color of shirt in the first and last pics, it is not very masculine."

Definitely want to fix the haircut. I'm not out to my parents so I still go to a ""salon"" but as soon as I get to college in the fall (woo!) I'm heading straight for a barber.

transpassing,38ls5m,iucundus_acerbus,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:31 2015 UTC,You look really male to me. I suggest squaring off your sideburns though to add a more masculine touch to your hair style. You look great btw!
transpassing,38i6q4,laurenloves,6,Thu Jun 4 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling very confused about my ability to accurately judge how you're passing. Honestly, sure, in my opinion you have a few facial structural features (nothing you can fix without FFS or waiting for HRT to change soft tissue) that I see that make me read you as AMAB (though obviously female). That being said, I'm trans, I obsess over those things on myself, it's natural that I should see them in others. I think your best bet to see how you're doing would be to post on /r/rateme, or /r/amiugly, on a throwaway and see what people say. Get a few more pics collected to post with this one if you do that.  And like I said, if you do decide to post there, where you'll get feedback from a group of people more representative of society, do it on a throwaway. It's natural to look through peoples' posts before commenting, and the feedback will be tainted if somebody mentions that they see from your profile that you're trans.  Also, regardless of whether you're 100% stealth yet, you look really great."

transpassing,38i6q4,MissHalina,5,Thu Jun 4 11:38:43 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd say, is find you a necklace and do something with the hair. Maybe go with the Rachel. Ah timely reference. But as far as facial features go, PASS well. And good on you for starting young.  Also, learn to smile with teeth, and with your eyes too. So much about femininity can be gained through body language and facial expression. It says that you're the source of happiness as opposed to a look of concern. Males and females are drawn to happy paired with feminine.  I would look through comic books for females, smiling, and I would emulate their expressions some times. Equal parts smile and eyes."
transpassing,38i6q4,Courtney1Yeah,3,Thu Jun 4 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"I would do something with your hair, but I think you look good. Hair just looks like it was grown out without getting it styled and it's a bit unkempt. Some layers and some deep conditioning and regular maintenance should fix that."

There are more than 2 potential chromosomal pairings possible for sex. In fact a number of the combinations are quite common. I'm not masking anything, I'm changing to reflect who I am. I'm not mutating anything, hell I haven't even had any surgery.  Why are you even here? Shoo."

transpassing,38i6q4,Oh_Look_A_Camera,4,Thu Jun 4 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"Usually    That's the key word here. We're not the ""usual"" people. Obviously.  According to the newest theories, when we were still fetus' we were subjected to the wrong chemicals, so our bodies grew into a different sex than our brains gender identity. So while we were born one physical sex (or as you're incorrectly calling ""gender""), that's not what we are.   And you're also incorrect about ""those chromosomes and the associated genes and receptors for chromosomes ultimately determine the male female development pathway...."" This is not true at all. Genetics are not that black and white. In fact, many of these chromosomal pairings can yield a combination of the physical genders, or a lack of them. Also, sex and gender is not solely chromosome dependent, there are a lot of other variables. Plus you're reducing gender to chromosomes, which is simply not true. I get that you're uneducated but please be willing to learn and not insult those that you don't understand."

transpassing,38i7gn,LoisCarmenDenominatr,2,Thu Jun 4 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? Even my profile? I mean, perhaps I'm just not able to be an objective judge of myself, but I look at pictures of my profile and I see a hairline that's very ""masculinized"" - look how it makes a sharp 90 degree angle at the top, as well as a jaw that's also obviously masculinized.   As someone whose judgment isn't clouded by my dysphoria, as mine might very well be, you really think that I look tooootally passable in the second pic? You don't even get a little twinge of ""this person is trans""?"
transpassing,38i7gn,jackfairy,7,Thu Jun 4 13:19:52 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean about your jaw, but if you were wearing more feminine clothes, I would not have given it a second thought. But wearing your hair down instead of pulled back with sunglasses would hide both your jaw and hairline (which looks perfectly fine) would be hidden. Also, your cheekbones are gorgeous!"
transpassing,38i7gn,Softvent,5,Thu Jun 4 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"No side burns,  great eyebrows and no MPB.    You shouldn't worry about your temples, you have basically no hair loss that I can see, and is totally normal for a woman. My hairline is kind of concave at the top corners...  I also wouldn't say your jaw is masculine,  you have a round face and your chin doesn't jut out. the only thing I could suggest is practicing on flexing up the muscle under your chin, the dignastic muscle, but that is a small complaint.  The only point I'd like to mirror from some other people, is the clothing,  specifically the pants are a bit baggier than most women would wear.   I know it sucks.  I have a heck of a time finding pants that fit, but don't feel like they are too tight, especially having lost weight recently (size 36 to 30)."
transpassing,38i7gn,batshiatbadger,2,Thu Jun 4 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"Your jawline looks like mine and I'm FTM pre-T.  You are very pretty. I agree with the clothing comments. You could do a lot with accessories I think. You could play around with shaping your eyebrows (something I always hated doing but I noticed it really changes how my face looks).  Tl;dr: don't worry about it, everything extra you do to yourself at this point is just gravy."
transpassing,38i7gn,Cat_Butt_Face,7,Fri Jun 5 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"I felt like I was getting weird looks from strangers today (my first full day being out in public), and I couldn't tell if it was because I was white (I'm in Seoul right now) or because I was obviously trans. After getting looks all day, I hastily took these pictures in an empty bathroom, so I apologize for their lack of composition, as well as their quality.  Regarding my passability, I think a few obvious things aren't in my favor at the current time.   My profile. I dunno if it's my hair, or my jaw, or the thickness of my eyebrows as seen from the side, but whatever it is, my profile pics just don't look feminine. My first year of HRT was on a dose that, in retrospect, was way too low. I'm really hoping that I'll see more progress in the future on the dosages I'm on as of 6 months ago. My hair. I went to hairdresser 6 months ago who a: I wasn't out to, and b: didn't know how to cut curly hair. My hair has this really severe angle where everything in front is short and everything in back is long, and it doesn't look like a traditionally feminine cut, more like a shaggy guy's cut. That's why I try to keep it back with headbands or my glasses."
transpassing,38i7gn,drea14,4,Thu Jun 4 11:35:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it was probably just because you were a pretty foreigner, I lived in Asia and will tell you probably 90% of the attention I got was because I was a gaijin, not because I was androgynous, or a dyke in a suit, or just a weirdo or whatever else the average bigot would negatively judge me as. I think you look pretty androgynous yourself and would probably gender you more on your presentation than your looks, so voice and mannerisms would play a big role. I think your fashion style seems rather ungendered and if you want to try to skew more female I'd suggest a more feminine cut of jeans, skinny jeans not boyfriend jeans would help, and a better fitting shirt. Women's tees tend to be fitted more than men's, and unless put with leggings I don't think the oversized tee look is very flattering, but that's just personal opinion."
transpassing,38i7gn,laurenbug2186,2,Thu Jun 4 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"If this is day 1 in public, you're consumed with how everyone sees you.  I did it in the reverse order: I went public (at work where I've been for 20 years) before I started hormones.  By the time all that kicked in, I'd been going outside dressed as a woman for 4 months.  I had a little game of ""clocking distance"" where I would try to see how far away people would have ""that"" reaction when they spotted me.    You also will learn, as a woman you are viewed differently than a man.  And you are in the capitol city of a fairly male, patriarchal social order (I've been there myself and studied TKD under a Korean grandmaster, so I've experienced it too).  You will see a MILLION things from a different POV.  But as far as being SEEN as female, only someone coming around the side would even guess otherwise, and that's largely your clothing and hairdo, really."
transpassing,38i7gn,mamablotto,2,Thu Jun 4 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do agree a little with you about the view from the side. I think it's the brows, you should try bringing them out from the inside the tiniest bit. Like a millimeter. Also try some contouring on your cheeks, you have a square face and need give yourself some cheekbones.   You have a natural beauty from what I can see, the lovely curly hair. Just tweak a couple things and you're going to do great!!  As far as the clothes, either fitted jeans or a fitted top would make you look more feminine."

There's a subreddit around here for curly hair, I'd suggest checking them out if you aren't already; and like you pointed out a more feminine cut (though IMO it's still pretty femme now).  Confidence and body language are the only two that we can't see in the picture, so it's hard to tell.

transpassing,38i7gn,anon5489,2,Thu Jun 4 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna agree with others and say I really think your clothes are the problem.

I don't think your profile is non-passing either but I probably wouldn't pull my hair back in the front like that, it's not the most flattering style for your hairline on the sides. I would venture you're getting a lot of looks in Seoul because of your clothing and most of all probably your height since the average height of Korean women is like 5'2""."
transpassing,38i7gn,anon5489,2,Thu Jun 4 21:57:05 2015 UTC,The only real thing I saw that made me think male was your cheeks aren't very full and if I didn't already know I doubt I'd clock you. I think you might consider widening the gap between your eyebrows a touch more. It'll make them look less thick there and present more feminine. Just be real careful and go a little at a time because too much distance will look odd.
transpassing,38i7gn,Sarahjan,2,Thu Jun 4 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"Your profile doesnt pass imo.  Straight on you look passable but your hair is kind of andro, you should grow it out more and wear a more put together style.  It looks like you haven't styled it at all."

The distance between your eyebrows is great - tidy them up and I think they'll be awesome. Your nose appears narrow and upturned which is a definite plus. It is hard to tell for sure without a profile shot. Your jaw looks narrow already, but the beard and hair shadow make it hard to tell. Starting hrt will thin out the muscles on the side a little and you will be gravy from what I can see. Your chin looks great and you have a very good distance of nose to lips and lips to chin, avoiding two masculine traits well (long chin, long top lip). Your cheeks are sunken which is usually a tell but hrt often helps with that too. Also your hair is already long which will help a lot when you want to transition, it is a good headstart.  In a year or two you'll be one of the insanely pretty girls posting here and I'll hate you for looking so much better than me."

She even agreed to help with make-up and anything else I may need in the near future of transitioning. I may be able to find an older photo of myself to post here and show my face in more depth.  Edit: unfortunately, they all feature the neckbeard I'm forced to grow temporarily. I'll try and find one that's suitable enough with it, I guess."

You will find that by doing so, it's easier to not get bothered by stares (yes, there will be stares) and allow yourself to enjoy the process.

transpassing,38hrpw,rosharon,4,Thu Jun 4 08:23:26 2015 UTC,"You're tall and lanky so I think you can probably pull off quite a bit of feminine clothing as long as you stay away from things meant to emphasize the hips, leggings and yoga pants I imagine would look great on you. For makeup I'd suggest a darker eyeliner, the grey looks a bit washed out, and to bring the liner closer to your lash line, there should be no gap between your lashes and the liner, finish with a nice gloss black mascara. Your eyebrows could definitely use a reshaping as they have no arch to them, which is a waste because you have pretty eyes. I'd suggest going to a brow bar and pencilling them in some to give them more form."

transpassing,38hrpw,drea14,3,Sun Jun 7 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"Tall or not, you look very femme (and pretty) right away, like so many I see.  There is such a thing as vocal feminization surgery; a friend of mine has had the first phase and goes back for part II soon.  I have seen and heard a video of it and it does work very well.  I've worked with some pretty tall cis ladies, and increasingly that is not the issue . . . just be the self that you are comfortable being.    For clothes, you may have to special order a lot of things for the size, but dresses will work fine, skirts and tops work well for me (I have no butt, even after 8 months of HRT) and of course if you do HRT you will get boobs.  After while, it's just your presentation that will matter, and it will matter more to you than to anyone else.    Girl hairdo, girl eyebrows, obviously those will help, you have gorgeous lips and very pretty eyes, there are videos to help you apply makeup and make some cis girl friends . . . if you find the right ladies they will be delighted to help you out."

transpassing,38ev39,summer_d,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"I used to not give my brows attention. But when I started to pay attention to them, they really made a difference for me, and once my eye was trained to see it, there was no more not noticing them every time I looked in the mirror. When it comes to the face, millimeters make a world of difference--like with plastic surgery.  Also, smile, and smile with your eyes too. Straightforward looks are a sort of male, nonverbal message to other males, saying you don't want to mess with me.  Look up animated girls or comic book girls who are smiling. Notice how they smile with their eyes as well.  Practice and cultivate a smile you can make happen on command.  I learned to raise my eyebrows up, one usually higher than the other, show teeth, and flex my cheek muscles--the ones at the front of my face--- altogether. After practice, it became more natural flowing.  It may feel fake at first, but practice it and take a a bunch of practice selfies. You'd be surprised at how feminine a well cultivated smile can be-- it is also based in our human biology, subconsciously even, that smiles are feminine and somewhat submissive."

transpassing,38a8ns,Feyle,4,Tue Jun 2 22:17:35 2015 UTC,I would definitely gender you female in all of those photos but weirdly I think that you pass the best in pictures 1 and 4. Sorry I'm sure that's not very helpful.
transpassing,38a8ns,Feyle,3,Tue Jun 2 22:20:20 2015 UTC,is there anything specific about 2 and 3 that you can think of which makes me less passable?
transpassing,38a8ns,Feyle,5,Tue Jun 2 22:24:25 2015 UTC,Firstly let me reiterate that I would gender you female in all the pictures.   But what made me pick 1 and 4 is that in 2 your face is at an odd angle and in 3 with all your hair back and from that downward angle you look slightly more masculine.
transpassing,38a8ns,Feyle,3,Tue Jun 2 22:26:50 2015 UTC,you don't need to worry about offending me; i know that i don't pass anywhere close to 100% of the time. thanks very much for the feedback! :)
transpassing,38a8ns,Verndari,4,Tue Jun 2 22:28:47 2015 UTC,I'm not worried about offending you. I was worried about you taking the criticism without the context. From these pictures I can't see how you look overall but I would expect you to be passing 100% (or close to) of the time based on your face.
transpassing,38a8ns,CynicalCarrots,2,Tue Jun 2 22:32:34 2015 UTC,hmm OK - i added a full body photo that i took just now (sorry i had to auto-adjust.. bad lighting in my hallway at night): http://i.imgur.com/pGAeHMF.jpg
transpassing,38a8ns,Nicole23UK,5,Tue Jun 2 22:56:27 2015 UTC,From that photo I would definitely gender you female. Even trying to see you as male in that photo doesn't work for me.
transpassing,38a8ns,biographer_seahorse,2,Tue Jun 2 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think both looks are indisputably female, but you are more feminine in the non makeup pictures because your lips are darker in them. This makes sense because facial feature/skin contrast is a key female marker.   In my opinion, you might want to try a darker shade of lipstick whenever you wear make up. But I also think you look great without it, so if you want to save time you should not bother. :)"

transpassing,38a8ns,cainyounot,2,Wed Jun 3 13:37:31 2015 UTC,"Its not the makeup per say, its probably the kind of makeup your getting and the way your applying it... try to go for a foundation that matches your skin tone better and that isnt such a heavy coverage, a little concealer for those trouble zones, set it with some powder and then contour lightly with some bronzer, maybe a little subtle rose/coral blush, curl your lashes then apply a coat or two of mascara, some nude pink lipgloss and your good to go :)"

Idk what, but it should have more volume.  That dress isn't great either. The frills seem to accentuate your stomach, making you look more conical that hourglass.

transpassing,389mfv,blndcavefsh,-1,Tue Jun 2 22:47:28 2015 UTC,Yeah you have to be quite young for bone structure to be affected. It seems kind of baseless to say that someone needs FFS because they didn't start hormones at a certain age. Most of us didn't have that kind of privilege.

I thought to myself im a nice person why doesnt anyone hang out with me. Then i asked myself when is the last time i asked someone to hang out with me.   Ask them to go do something that has 'low commitment time' like getting coffee or food. That way if you or the other person feels uncomfortable you can excuse yourself easily.

Soapbox moment here: I want to add that I think it's important to say she's lucky to have me too. Too often, spouses who transition are made to feel as if we are forever indebted to our partners for staying with us. The subtext of comments like, ""You're so lucky to have her/him!"" is ""You're lucky she still wants to be with you,"" as if our partners have made a regrettable sacrifice. My wife and I are very happily married, even more so than before I transitioned, and I know she gets tired of people telling her that I'm really lucky she stuck with me.

transpassing,380pka,Me-Power-Me,7,Mon Jun 1 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"Totally fair! You do you, and I personally think you're really attractive.   The hair length is probably the biggest issue right now. Something shorter and more ""business-like""?"
transpassing,380pka,Me-Power-Me,3,Mon Jun 1 00:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!    I completely agree with that (hair length/ way it falls).  I'm thinking about taking volume off the top.  In that pic, I had no product in my hair, and I just think I need something that is simpler but can be worked with/ played up a bit more without it being long and high on top."

transpassing,38072t,Rekoza,3,Sun May 31 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Of course you have a shot. I'm assuming you're not full time yet because you look like you're not really trying? Here are some tips for when you're going full time/committing: Clean up your eyebrows. Make them arched, and thinner than they are now. Wear makeup. Eyeliner and mascara at the least, because drawing attention to your eyes makes you appear more feminine, but a light blush and some concealer really wouldn't hurt, either. Brush your hair and get a feminine haircut. Long hair isn't inherently feminine, you need to get it cut in a feminine style.  And wearing light/pastel colors and fitted clothes will help a lot more than a baggy hoodie."
transpassing,38072t,cainyounot,1 point,Sun May 31 23:19:15 2015 UTC,I really appreciate this comment. This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you so much. For cleaning up my eyebrows is that something I could get away with doing now without raising suspicions? I'm pretty much saving the entirety of this comment and will be working towards passing now. Thank you so much!
transpassing,38072t,cainyounot,2,Mon Jun 1 23:32:53 2015 UTC,"Your eyebrows aren't awful now or anything, so you'd probably be close to passable with just clothes, makeup, and a haircut, so if you have to be closeted sometimes, tidy/arched eyebrows might give you away as a trans woman because cis guys almost never do anything to their eyebrows. Eyebrows are a huge part of passing because they're so gender-specific, and it's likely that a change would be noticeable when you're in guy-mode."
transpassing,38072t,cainyounot,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:22:43 2015 UTC,Thank you for clearing that up for me! I'll keep that in mind. One other question was everytime I get my hair cut feminine it ends up too short. Right now I'm just trying to grow it out as long as possible so that the hairdresser has more options when it gets cut and I don't have to lose a lot of length. Is that a good idea or should I go for more feminine cuts now and grow it out gradually?
transpassing,38072t,summer_d,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell how long your hair is now- but bangs are the best way to make a haircut feminine without taking off length. Since you're not full-time, blunt bangs is a no. But side-swept bangs are more subtle, and they can still be feminine. That way you could grow out your hair as much as you'd like and just keep the bangs trimmed."

I suppose she's young and may be insecure - and we all naturally want to be supportive if that's the case - but people here are generally looking for help blending in against the odds. For OP, the odds are forever in her favour.   It's a touchy subject for a group of people who (for the most part) weren't given the support they craved while growing up, and such differences in experience is something that all of us need to keep in mind regardless of our own advantages and disadvantages."

You have nice big eyes that you should play up. A little peach blush on the apples of your cheeks will also make your features look softer.

Just some light brown eyeliner on top and a bit of mascara or something. You have potential but you're not exercising it at all."

If there's a bunch of butch lesbians in the area, they might be mistaking you for them because of the flannel, and that's what they're used to seeing when they see someone in flannel? I dunno, stereotypes are weird.  You are wearing the necklace in every picture though, so I gotta assume some sort of significance to you. It's probably not such a dealbreaker that you should throw it away if it's important to you, on the off chance it helps.   Getting a bit of stubble with more time on T should also help, even if it's all shaven away, since it doesn't completely disappear. I dunno how your hair growth is going though.

As your hair gets longer, the fringe may come across as a little feminine. I also agree with kyratheon - I'd avoid jewelry in general until you've been on hormones a little longer.

I am not a huuuuge face of that lip color. but its ok..idk...like there is just too much purple in it.  Your eyebrows need work, yes a bold brow is in still, but yours still need to be thinned out and they look like they might be too close together (honestly hard to tell from the pic, a front profile would help)  I actually really like the hair you have but the way it is parted is showing how high up the hairline is. I love the texture and the color though! Its just parted weird, and you should play around with it a bit more to find a way to part it that kind of naturally flows into your hair.

There's no real beating around the bush here: the only guaranteed way to lose weight is to consume less calories than you use up on a daily basis. Just yesterday I found this explanation thanks to Reddit: 11 reasons why you're not losing weight which is written harshly, but meant to be supportive.   Over the past six months I have lost roughly 15 pounds by simply minding my caloric intake. I've done nothing more than use the MyFitnessPal app on my phone to track everything I eat, as well as tracking my exercise. As the article I linked to indicates: it's very important to be fully honest about what you enter.   By doing this, not only did I learn about my own eating habits, but I've also managed to lost weight by simply eating a bit less than my daily calories burnt. The app also allows you to make a setting where you want to lose 1<X<4 pounds a week, and it'll do the math for you in setting a limit on your daily intake.   Best of luck DDDchu!"
transpassing,37og13,littlemissfuzzy,2,Fri May 29 03:44:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i just wen through the whole article. I need to exercise better and really watch what I am eating, because I eat..... a lot"
transpassing,37og13,littlemissfuzzy,1 point,Fri May 29 03:52:04 2015 UTC,"Best of luck to you! Seriously, it's hard work to lose weight, but I'm confident that you can do it!  Just imagine the dresses you could wear! :) I'm sure I look a lot nicer in my dresses at 72kg than I would've at the 95kg I was a few years ago.  You can do it!!"
transpassing,37og13,kpatable,3,Fri May 29 09:29:32 2015 UTC,"What littlemissfuzzy said is helpful, but I also think the WAY you approach weight loss is JUST as important as what you do to lose it. It's important to go about it slowly so you don't get overwhelmed. A tip I have heard of is to eliminate one bad food at a time and replace it with something. Like, the first week eliminate soda and replace it with water. Then cheetos (or whatever) and replace them with snap peas (because they are crunchy). Etc. That will help it seem less overwhelming. Also, I would recommend trying to get your eating better before you start exercising heavily. I think it would be a good idea to walk around your neighborhood, but, unless you have sky high confidence, going to the gym might make you self conscious. I know it used to make me self-conscious :T But just do what you're comfortable with.  Also, I watched this documentary about sugar and weight, and it revealed to me this surprising fact: if you lose weight by reducing calories, you have to keep eating that many calories and no more to retain the weight loss, even if someone who's your same weight but has never been overweight can eat more. It's a terrible biological feature of our bodies, but it's the truth. So I would be prepared to permanently the reduce the amount of calories you eat.  One more thing. My hand doctor told me, while diagnosing my hand injury, that recovery is not a constant progression upward. He said you will regress sometimes, and that's ok - and he was right. Some days I do slip up and overuse my hand and the pain comes back, but remembering what he said helps me to remember how far I have come. And this mantra has helped me in so many other areas of my life, too. It's funny how you can get so much inspiration and knowledge from a seemingly insignificant blip."

transpassing,37og13,michealcell,3,Fri May 29 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"Copying from a past comment of mine, edited slightly: I was 250 lbs at the end of October last year, when I started my diet and exercise; I've lost almost 52 lbs so far. I only weigh myself monthly, as your weight goes up and down and you can get discouraged easily if you weigh yourself daily.  For exercise, I started fast walking my husky around my subdivision twice (15 minutes each), then increased it to three times after a month, and finally increased it to four in January. It's hard to calculate exactly how many calories this burns; I'd guess 300-400 calories based on dog walking and fast walking rates.  My original diet that I started with was this:  Breakfast - 2 pop tarts (400 calories) and coffee (100 calories)  Lunch - 2 double cheeseburgers from McD's (860 calories)  Dinner - Bag pasta or Hamburger Helper (between 800-1000 calories)  So this totaled about 2200-2400 calories a day and I was only drinking diet soda's at the time. Even though the calorie count was a bit high, I was still under my daily calorie count, and thus was losing weight through it. I really like routines and don't mind eating the same thing every day, which has helped a lot with my dieting. My doctor helped me change my diet and also told me to switch to water and low sodium foods, as sodium causes water retention and thus bigger waist. So here is my current diet:  Breakfast - Peanut Butter sandwich (330 calories), banana (100 calories), coffee (100 calories)  Lunch - Sandwich (Turkey/Chicken/Ham meat 100 calories, 2 slices bread 130 calories, 2 tbsp low fat mayo 100 calories; total 330 calories), baby carrots (70 calories), granny smith apple (80 calories)  Dinner - 3 options:  Option 1 Another sandwich (330 calories), baby carrots (70 calories)  Option 2 Chicken Quesadilla (2 wheat taco tortillas 260 calories, Shredded Cheese 4 Cheese Mexican Reduced Fat 200 calories, chicken slices 200 calories; total 700 calories), Grape tomatoes (50 calories)  Option 3 Two tuna fish salad sandwichs (4 slices bread 260 calories, two tuna fish salad packets 200 calories; total 460 calories), baby carrots (70 calories)  So breakfast and lunch is a total of 1010 calories and then here are the totals with each dinner option:  Option 1 - 1410 calories; Option 2 - 1720 calories; Option 3 - 1560 calories  In 2 months or so, I'll probably cut out that apple for lunch. This is mainly because as I lose weight the amount of calories my body burns in a day decreases, so I will have to decrease my calorie intake as well. I hope this helps and gives you some ideas for setting up a diet."

For me I've tried every gimmick out there and the only thing I was successful with was running. I lost 40 lbs in a year that way (185-145). You have to make exercise not be a chore or you will find ways to avoid it. So instead of thinking ""ugh I don't want to workout today"" I would think ""I can't wait to listen to that new album or podcast on my run today.""  My other motivation was running races. I started out with 5Ks and after seeing the weight come off it motivated me to keep going and eventually do marathons.   Your thing doesn't have to be running, but you need to find something you enjoy so much you'll schedule other things around it just to fit it in."
transpassing,37og13,jxowe,1 point,Fri May 29 12:08:51 2015 UTC,"A couple of years ago, I lost 45 pounds.  I've held my weight to within 5 pounds of that.  I went from 219 to 174.  This is my observations...  Yes, it all comes down to eating less calories then you use, however, it is far from that simple.   There is a huge piece of willpower that is required to keep to that system, and, that willpower depends on a whole lot of things.  For me, I loose my will power if...   I'm bored Its been a long winter Its been a long sumer I have too much to do. I have too little to do (this, I guess is boredom) I've spent too much time socializing (i'm an Introvert) I've spent too little time socializing (because we all need a little social) I could probably go on.   It has taken me a whole lot of experimentation to figure out what makes me able to deal with my weight, and I expect that it is different for everyone.  Some of the things that mitigate the list above...   I turned my weight into a game.  I record all my numbers.  Every morning I get up and weight myself and record my weight, fat %, Hydration, and Muscle.  I record every day, and it keeps it interesting watching change depending on what I did the day or two before.  I also record blood pressure and heart rate. I use myFitnessPal.  I joined it with a friend.  We both had similar weight loss, however, he didn't stay with the system.  I meticulously record all my food... even when I'm over for the day... It keeps me honest. I find things to do that are social.  Currently its Karate.  Previously, I was learning ASL. I try to tune in to my subconscious to try and figure out when I am hitting one of my willpower things.  To know when I need to switch something up. I stopped drinking caffeine.  This was interesting.  I have found that caffeine is great for about a month, after which, I become an addict and my mental state is effected.    These are my items, however, you will probably have to figure out your own motivations and willpower.  I think it is massively complicated, which is why there are so many diet plans, because what works for one person, doesn't work for another."
transpassing,37og13,blahblahthrowthrow,1 point,Sat May 30 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"Weight loss is hard.  You need something you'll stick to.  The way I went is to cut out added sugar.  Keep your added sugar intake to 25 grams a day.  That means no soda (a can has a 40 grams) or candy.  You also can't have a lot of sugary meals like American Chinese food.    Then just eat mostly nutritious food like oatmeal, fish and brown rice stuff like that.  And when you want to treat yourself have a burger, small bag of potato chips or another savory treat.  If you have to go fast food once in a while skip the sugary soda and sweet sauces.    If you really really crave something sweet, buy like a can or bottle of coke and pour out all but six ounces.  Or buy some skittles and throw away all but 15-20 grams of sugar's worth.    Try to stay active through walking or other physical activity.    Sugar itself won't cause you to gain weight, but it does trick your body into not recognizing the calories you take in.  So if you have a lot of sugar you'll eat more of everything.  Anyway, I'm not an expert but I've been doing this for a couple months and I'm down 15 pounds WITHOUT dieting.  I still eat really great and tasty food all the time!  Just no added sugar."
transpassing,37og13,fieryhotthrowaway,1 point,Sat May 30 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if there was a clear answer to that then all those weight-loss pill and strategies that are advertised all over wouldn't bring in as much money.  A little tip that I think helps is simply to eat when you're hungry, but the moment you stop feeling hungry, stop eating. Not another bite. Even if there's one more bite left on the plate or it's a $50 steak or whatever, just don't eat it.   Exercise. Humans, as with most animals (not the sloth), are pretty much built for lots of physical exercise. It's time consuming, but walking for like, an hour a day will do wonders.   As for diets and whatnot, there are sooo many out there and people are religious believers in their diets, so I'll avoid delving into that. Just kidding.  Disclaimer: Before reading any further (into this already lengthy comment), I am going to recommend a diet that may not work. It works for me very well and I am currently probably more underweight than overweight, but I cannot promise how well it works for anyone else. This is not a professional or expert's opinion, and I hold no responsibility if this doesn't work. In other words, don't flame me for having a contrary view on dietary regulations.  Personally (but don't let anyone see this, and for those who do, this is what works for me, YMMV), as a more lithe person, I eat lots of fatty foods and protein (to make up for the fact that I never exercise) and skip on the sweets. I wouldn't call it a low-carb diet, but I hold off on carbs that aren't starches. So no cakes, no cookies, just things like rice (I love rice!!!!!) and other grains. The reason for eating fat is because it's very filling. I've gotten full just by splitting half a cup of half-and-half into a few cups of tea. So think meat (or better, fish!), butter, rice, and, of course, veggies. Skip your desert and have another bowl of rice instead! Fruits are good, but they're also high in fructose-y sugar, which some studies suggest is hard on your liver if memory serves, so I wouldn't recommend eating more than the equivalent of 3 apples a day. Another reason why eating tons of carbs isn't great: (Again, I am not recommending a ""low-carb diet"", simply a more limited one, think 100-150 carbs a day) The primary purpose of carbs is to act as fuel for your body to function. Any carbs you don't burn off exercising or in your body's standard operations gets stored as fat. Since my exercise is limited to dance practice and walks, I don't really need that many carbs because, you guessed it, I don't burn many. If you do construction work, manual labor, or do something that does require a lot of exercise and burns a lot of calories, you'll need to eat more carbs. Most runners eat hundreds upon hundreds of carbs a day because they burn hundreds and hundreds of carbs a day. But if you're not a runner, I would recommend NOT eating hundreds and hundreds of carbs a day. Again, repetition since this is important, you may remember from biology class that in cellular respiration, a cell turns sugar into ATP for instant use. But the reason that it has sugar in the first place is because it lasts much longer than ATP, about a week if I remember, to the 3 or so minutes that ATP lasts. But, if the cell is storing energy for a longer amount of time than that, it turns it into fat. Fat lasts for MONTHS before decomposing. So it takes much longer to get rid of if you aren't exercising a lot.   But that is ENTIRELY what works for me. If this doesn't help you or literally anybody else in this planet, well, then sorry for bad advice. It is simply what works for me."

I started tracking my calorie intake and doing some cardio every couple of days on the stationary bike at the gym. I'm now down to 215lbs after like 8 months? I eat around 1200-1300 calories per day and I'm still losing weight pretty rapidly. I've been on hormones the whole time so they haven't really stunted my weight loss at all. Honestly it's all about self control and making sure you track EVERYTHING in MyFitnessPal. But you can do it.   I tried losing weight so many times before but it never stuck. This time I did away with all of the fad diets and just ate less and exercised more, and I'm only like 30 pounds away from my goal now.   You can do it! Just remember, you're in it for the long game.

I'd try to open your eyes up some by defining/pruning back your brows some and maybe lining your eyes with a bolder liner. The frames on your glasses aren't very feminine so right now they kind of are working against you and hiding your eye makeup too so keep in mind when you wear makeup behind glasses you need to make it a bit bolder to show thru."

Also your glasses have a pattern, again pretty feminine.   Your eyebrows are very thin and feminine, hopefully T will put some growth in, and your sideburns are long and loose. I would shave them so they're at least not straggly, that tends to be a feminine thing in women who have shorter hairstyles."
transpassing,37csma,Reborn__,11,Tue May 26 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Different haircut is needed to pass. Dont go with androgynous haircuts, go with men's cuts. Square up your sideburns. Dont let your hairdresser angle your sideburns; this is what is done on women. You want them cut straight across, parallel with the ground.  You are in the same boat as me with eyebrows. Nothing can be done if those are natural and you haven't been shaping them. Just wait for T to fill them in."

You have kind of a wide face, too (as do I), and I think that glasses with sharper corners and straighter lines could compliment it. As for the bangs, I think the type of glasses I'm suggesting would go great with bangs. I would also try on the square-ish glasses, but also try out some more rectangular glasses, too. Rectangular, stlanted-in frames look good on me, and I think they might look good on you, too, because we both have similar shaped middle of our faces."

transpassing,37anx8,KrysG,1 point,Tue May 26 09:48:26 2015 UTC,"i would define eyebrow shape a bit more, and i agree with KrysG, take care of that hair! one good way to instantly soften and fix damaged hair is to cover it from root to tip in coconut oil (you can also ad olive oil) and leave that for a couple hours, then double shampoo it out. its what i do after bleaching to repair the damage and its never failed me."
transpassing,37anx8,amerequeer,1 point,Wed May 27 23:34:16 2015 UTC,"Part your hair either slightly to the left or right of the middle slanting back towards the center. The third and fourth photos are approaching this. It helps to make the face less blocky and draws the eye, also allows for a bit of forehead coverage should you need it. Glasses are good, but yeah clean your eyebrows up and you're doing well :)  Link to example of part http://m.stylebistro.com/lookbook/Amy+Adams/en7mzQbufy6/Hair"

Just on a personal taste note and not anything related to pass/fail: I would maybe go with a more purplish lipstick if you want to go with a bold color like in the last pic. Bold colors are fun and your lips are a beautiful shape, but I think that a shade closer to burgundy would suit your coloring a bit better. (Others may have better advice, that may just be my personal taste showing. Otherwise your makeup is great and gorgeous!) You have a lovely natural beauty! :)"

transpassing,375utw,kpatable,1 point,Wed May 27 06:27:21 2015 UTC,"You definitely have potential, that's for true. I only have two suggestions as I think the main thing you need is more time on the hormones. I would suggest doing some SLIGHT shaping on your eyebrows. Probably just plucking a tad under them to give yourself more of an arch. Look up a tutorial first and be VEEEEEERY cautious! x3 The other thing is to part your hair less extremely to the side. Coming from someone who had scene hair (good and bad XD) for several years, I think the sidebang only works if a significant amount goes across your forehead. Otherwise it just looks like a crazy comb over XD This would be a good example of a deep side part that works:  http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=118750510  It goes over the forehead. It might require a haircut, which I know its scary; just remember that it's only a suggestion! XD You could definitely just part it less deeply to the side, and you would look more feminine."

On an unrelated note,  I'm not sure what's going on under your collar (if that white is paper or what), but it looks a bit like a priest's collar to me; it might suit you to wear a tie if you like ties.

Get some shirts that bulk up your shoulders without being baggy - by that I mean fit and accentuate your shoulders. I find some polos work well, others stay the hell away from. Make sure the seams lay that the end of your shoulder, not further down or closer to your neck.  If its colder where you are, sweaters work. Layering clothing helps a lot of transguys. Avoid flannel, that is a staple in the butch lesbian uniform now.  Your haircut will work when you are a few month into hormones, but it doesn't help you now. I'm no expert on that, but every thread with ftms has said the short side, long top haircut does wonders. Its what I sported before hormones and it brought my passing percentage to near 90%.   Start working out now for when you start T in a month. I was very tired when I started T, and have heard other guys were too, so you might not have the energy to start a new routine. Make it part of your schedule now.  I have nothing else to go on with your pics, so hopefully this little bit helps."

I only have a few button down shirts and polos but a lot of them are too big for me, I have a hard time finding men's clothes that fit me!  I do normally get the short back and sides, slightly longer cut on top everyone is suggesting, it's just my hair grows so damn fast! And I'm a cheap bastard, I wait several months before getting it cut. I should learn how to cut it myself but afraid of ruining it.  I've joined a gym, started an exercise/healthy eating regimen, and joined an online FTM fitness group for motivation. I'm about two weeks in, exercising every day, and already starting to feel more whole and energized and the fat from my stubborn female pattern fat (thighs and hips) melting away. I can't wait to start T next month so I can start bulking up in a male pattern!"
transpassing,371q0j,shadelz,1 point,Thu May 28 10:45:36 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I know waiting sucks, but trust me, its worth it. You will see changes pretty quickly, especially muscle mass if you are eating right and strength training.   You might want to consider going shorter on the top for your hair. Still shorter on the side, longer on top, but only like max of an inch on the top. If you have someone who can do touch-ups, investing in a cheap trimmer would be great for the sides and back. I'd leave the top for a hairdresser/barber. I'll try to find a picture in a bit, I'm at work right now."

It's funny because I posted a face pic several years ago and everyone said that my face looked 100% male. I think it might have to be due to me gaining weight. I used to religiously exercise 6 days a week as a teen. Trying to get back to my old routine right now. I start T next month so hopefully it'll help.

transpassing,36ytip,taypuc31,15,Sat May 23 07:11:42 2015 UTC,I'd recommend not tying your hair back. Your jaw and neck are wide. By pulling your hair back you're only exposing them more.
transpassing,36ytip,Hammi_and_Chippie,6,Sat May 23 07:28:02 2015 UTC,"Are you on hrt? Your face seems to hold fat in a very masculine way (around the jaw and lower cheeks), whereas, on hrt, it might hold fat around your upper cheeks more, which I think would help make you seem more feminine. I agree with Hamml, too, that you shouldn't tie your hair back. Putting some or all of it forward and over your shoulders will cover up some of your jaw and neck."

I love the outfit but maybe you should go for a wide-strap tank top or V-necks, to get the attention from your shoulders. Also, try circular cut skirts, that are high waisted, they will give you a hourglass-like figure :)   Countouring your face would be a very strong game!

Working out and building muscle could help, too, but that's hard and a long term thing. I think you could try filling in your eyebrows; just color in the patchy parts with an eyebrow pencil that matches your hair color. Thicker, fuller eyebrows will make you look more masculine. That's all the advice I can think of. I don't want to invalidate your dysphoria at all, and I know it's different for guys, but, when you're much older, you might be grateful for your younger-looking-ness. I have a baby face, and, even before I identified as a trans feminine genderqueer person, I was grateful for it because I would look younger when I'm actually older. Idk if that helps. As I've grown to the ripe old age of 23 (XD), I've become much more aware that I WILL get older, I WILL get wrinkles, and it's pretty much downhill from here XD :I So I'm thankful for the youthfulness I have."

Bangs that went to your eyebrows would help conceal your brow, which isn't bad, but your forehead is broad and the unnatural looking part draws attention up toward it.  Your jaw is pretty masculine but it's mostly your sunken cheeks that make me notice.  Keep practicing with makeup, if you can find some combination that makes it softer looking it'd help.

transpassing,36tksz,throwaWayyysaway,6,Fri May 22 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think you need to work some more on hiding beard shadow as the lower part of your face looks much darker to me, but it could be the poor lighting in the room. A solid foundation is probably the most important part of makeup because it's basically the canvas you're painting on, Creme foundations give a bit more coverage so if your skin isn't too dry you may want to look into that for covering any stubborn spots, I'm cisfem but I still use concealer around my brows to give a nice sharp edge so don't think a solid coverage is anything ladies never do. Also white hair is so. Hard. Hahaha, my mum has glorious stark white hair and I've always admired it, but have never inherited it, so I've gone the bleach and toner route and you really have to strip the hell out of your hair if you're not blonde lol, be prepared to have your hair suffer ( but it's worth it, white hair is gorgeous!)"

My only suggestion is related to makeup, not passability (if that's a word, but anyway you do pass just fine). I would recommend not lining your entire lower lash line, for it looks quite harsh. I would only line 1/3 or 1/4 of the outer part. I would also try over lining your lips just a little bit. It can give you some fuller lips to go nicely with the color you picked. You could post your picture to r/makeupaddiction, and they could give you some really good pointers. I'm a make up addict myself, so that's the only reason I'm trying to help with the makeup. Otherwise, you look female to me."

transpassing,36kdyx,ohgodwhereisthis,2,Wed May 20 01:20:04 2015 UTC,I'm a bit uninformed on what was blocked or not blocked. Was 'hugbox' blocked? cause that word honestly describes the atmosphere in a lot of threads on this board.
transpassing,36kdyx,dominojuice,3,Wed May 20 04:44:26 2015 UTC,Hugbox was apparently an outdated term used to refer to a machine that would hug a person with autism to calm them down. But the definition evolved to mean someone lying to you to keep you happy. And so someone whined to the mods about it offending autistic people even though no one has ever really gotten upset over it.

transpassing,36h9vj,aria22,2,Tue May 19 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"I agree.   I'm still working on mine on a daily basis but i still haven't switched using my new voice at all times.  When im at work and out'n'about, i do. But at home, with my g/f who is also trans, i feel safe... so i don't use it as much.  I gave my name to go see a speach specialist but that could take months. Meanwhile, i don't have any problems passing but i am self conscious around poeple i don't know and i can have difficulty having the right pitch and tone."
transpassing,36h9vj,kasika_tg,1 point,Tue May 19 17:07:05 2015 UTC,"Using your female voice full-time is the best practice you can have, in my opinion.. I had to gather the courage to do it, but once I switched, it got better gradually as I used it :) The thing that helped me is.. Your voice might sound weird for a while. But as a transgirl you might not completely pass anyway.. So like no-hrt being an in-between stage, a weird voice can be an in-between stage as well, a stepping stone to a good girl voice :) A voice that has more and more feminine qualities, and gradually, becomes more like a girls' voice, but in the beginning, might still sound somewhat like a guys' voice, albeit less masculine than before - and less masculine is always good, right? :) So I accepted that my voice might sound weird, but figured it would be worth the risk, because otherwise I might never switch my voice.. I'm glad I did, because apparently I am passing (at least in gaming communities :)). But, of course, it's good if you do make sure that your voice sounds okay before you start going fulltime with it. But even if it doesn't sound like a completely feminine voice yet, it's still better than using a heavy male voice that gets you clocked instantly."

If you want some CC: like another commenter said, that's not a smokey eye (which typically use darker colors), and the frosted lip doesn't work very well (especially not that color with the eyeshadow you chose). You also need to either work on your blending technique, or your liner came off a bit on your crease... I'm leaning more towards the latter, which a faster drying liner or keeping your eyes closed/half open for a while after applying it (so it doesn't smudge in your crease when you open your eyes) would help with.

The word probably isn't banned as a slight against homosexuality. This is first and foremost a trans space. Having your appearance attributed to any kind of sexuality can be very insulting. I'd believe this is the reason why."

Lose the middle part. It's masculine. Get more feminine glasses. Squared, wire-framed glasses read as masculine always. Tame your brows, make them arched. And a little mascara couldn't hurt. Good luck!"

I'd def. look into getting lighter more feminine frames next time you get some too. I'm not sure if you just don't like makeup or aren't sure how to wear it, but wearing some would help feminine your face and add some interest too, if nothing else a nice lipgloss to pink up your lips and add a sheen would be a nice way to add a low maintenance girly aspect"

Even siblings isn't easy to believe.  You've really come a long way.  Did you have any sort of FFS?  When I look at a mirror it's really hard to imagine passing even if I got electrolysis.  I've always hated looking at myself and have always felt not especially masculine, but really ugly, and I guess I worry that I'll just feel the same.  It probably doesn't help that I've had hair past my shoulders before and I never looked especially feminine to myself (though I try to remind myself that I never did anything with it to make it look feminine either)"
transpassing,363w8k,The_Third_Three,1 point,Sat May 16 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had upper-face FFS and SRS at the same time (a hard recovery!) in December 2013.  If I dig into my photos from before that, I can show you these photos.  Even before surgery, I did get clients not recognising me, and even giving me opinions about myself from before, as though I were a different person.  Some did recognise me though.  When I looked in the mirror, I couldn't understand why I was passing 99%, because I could see nothing but a dolled-up version of my old face.  Since FFS, old clients only recognise me if they saw me post-transition but pre-op.  My face is different enough that I don't make any connection to before.  Memory of living as a guy is starting to fade.  Long hair alone does little.  I had long hair, piercings and nail polish as a teenager, and it just made me look like I was into grunge."

transpassing,363w8k,BlindSquirrels,1 point,Mon May 18 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"The polite term is ""cleft chin""!  I don't know what happened to it.  It was never particularly pronounced.  I presume that reduction in muscle and shifts in fat distribution flattened it out.  My jawline feels different to the touch: you can just press through the fat layer to the bone, whereas previously there was a thick muscle layer in the way.  The end of my nose was cleft too; that was fixed with Dr Chettawut's scalpel.  There isn't really anything special about Chet's FFS or the HRT I've taken.  It's just that everyone's genetics give a different starting point, and respond differently to hormonal stimuli."

I think if you'd have submitted it without saying first I would have had a hard time telling for sure but walking into it knowing what I do, you sounded a bit like the ""gay male stereotype"" you see in media.  Keep practicing - I assure you that you're much better at sounding feminine than I am, and it's difficult to learn for many people.  Just keep in mind that talking in a different register than your naturally used to can cause strain to your vocal chords so if you can see a professional coach, I would do so!  SO.  I muted the video and just watched you.  I couldn't tell that you were anything but a young girl.  Really cute, with very feminine mannerisms.  Your eyes are beautiful and I love your nails.

Your skin is glowing but the contrast with your neck draws attention to itself.  A little bit less or maybe a scarf tied around your neck would help a little.  Also, in the first picture, you're thrusting your chin out and holding your head up, which frames your face as masculine.  Notice how feminine you look in the last few pictures?  You don't have to tuck your head down in an unnatural way, but pulling your neck back a little so that your chin can naturally be a little more submissive helps with feminine angling.  It's something I've been working on myself as I get ready to transition, because I picked up the head back, chin forward, dominant face from the military and it's been a hard habit to shake.  My wide jaw is much less noticeable when my chin is even an inch and a half lower.  Try it and see what you think.

I think some of the locs in the front by your face are very nice-looking, but some of the ones in back are kinda too thick. You don't really see a lot of girls with really thick locs (well, maybe white girls doing neglect dreads, because when they split it up the dreads don't stay locked, so they have no choice but to leave it thick, and it doesn't really look nice).

I'd say your body and body language pass extremely well and your style seems cute and confident. That dress is perfect on you!  If you're interested in constructive feedback: A half up/up do would also show off your neck and shoulders, which read as very feminine to me. Your brows and facial structure are definitely androgynous leaning to female. If you're interested in makeup, a lightweight foundation that evens out the skin (and masks any shadow) might be a great addition to show off your features. I'd also recommend the tiniest bit of mascara to make your eyes pop and emphasize your feminine features!"

About your makeup: I think you should try starting your eyeliner a little closer to your upper tear duct and if you're going to use that much be sure to add the equivalent in mascara. Remember to only play up either your eyes or lips at once but not both simultaneously. So if you wanna use that much eyeliner perhaps go with a lipgloss instead of lipstick or maybe a more neutral lip stain/stick.  Just my 2 cents...
transpassing,35zxp0,FollowMoralOrders,-1,Fri May 15 02:14:08 2015 UTC,"I have a stye ATM, so I can't get anything near the tear ducts, and can't touch mascara.  I usually do a really good job with makeup.    I put on the makeup for this in about 5 minutes.  I didn't bother to do my usual lipstick routine (which involves a bunch of blending), so the bright red is, I agree, a bit much."
transpassing,35zxp0,SonicRadboom,2,Fri May 15 10:30:56 2015 UTC,Very harsh liner without any mascara looks like you don't know what you're doing. Why can't you use mascara or go closer to the tear duct?
transpassing,35zxp0,FollowMoralOrders,-1,Sat May 16 03:12:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a swollen and clogged tear duct.  I just used a marker, due to the fact that it produced the least goop.  I didn't want to get close to the duct, and mascara was to messy to allow on my eye while it was healing.  I know how to do eyeliner."
transpassing,35zxp0,arthursbeardbone,5,Sat May 16 11:20:55 2015 UTC,you asked why i thought you didn't pass and I'm just giving you advice. If you know how to do makeup you should do your makeup properly when asking as it draws attention when it's not right. Likely more attention than not wearing any at all.

If you want to be andro you nailed it because this picture made my head hurt.  Edit: I went back again I'm guessing AFAB... That's only after analyzing your face for 3ish minutes though. You're like the master of androgyny lol... As for advice I think you can tip the scales of confusion more by getting more gender neutral glasses. Yours are more feminine than masculine. But that's just based off this photo.. If you look more masculine normally you may want the more feminine frame. Best wishes.

transpassing,35wwki,silentxem,2,Thu May 14 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"Third and fourth are very good. Nice hair accessory in the last photo. :)   First and second photos not so good. Too much volume on top of your hair. Not so sure of the layering of black, then white then teal with your clothes. The necklace and charm as pretty as it is, unfortunately draws the eyes to the layering.  IMHO I'd round off a tiny touch the corners on the tops of the brows so it's more of a gentle curve and less of an abrupt change in direction, but that's just me so don't think you have to do it (I had a similar brow shape and it just reminds me of the old male me).  There's an ever slight beard shadow on your upper lip, but some cis women with dark hair get this too, it's up to you if you want to lighten that or remove the hair that causes it."

It starts too far off to the side, and bunches up on top. A more natural hair look would really accentuate your femininity.  The earrings and the necklace are very nice, very conservative and proper. Keep that style up! Your makeup is spot on, no need to change anything. It really suits your face.  Turtleneck sweaters give one massive colour field. This works well in moss green, wine red, navy blue or a subtle pastel like pale blue or beige, but bright violet is not the colour to go with if you want to wear a turtleneck. It makes someone look — well, like a cat lady. This colour is fine, however, on blouses and cardigans, especially with a bit of a pattern and when mixed with layers of similar shades. For turtlenecks, go with a more subdued colour."

I feel like your lips look very feminine and your features are pretty androgynous at the moment. Your hair and eyes are very pretty, I must say!  I like The first pair of glasses better, the second pair looks too big for your face almost.  Your eyebrows just need to be cleaned up a bit and given a bit more of an arch. They don't really need to be much thinner or anything.   I can't help much with clothing since you dress pretty much the way I dressed before I realized I was trans and started transitioning (I'm FTM.)

transpassing,35ml0v,Kyrasthrowaway,2,Mon May 11 19:23:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! When I do my eyeliner my eye is closed. If there's a gap I just fill it in with my eye open so I can get into the lashes. It also helps that I use liquid eyeliner so it's pretty easy to fill it in.
transpassing,35ml0v,LikeGoldAndFaceted,2,Mon May 11 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"Get liner that spreads easily. My preference is for pencils that need to be sharpened, but not the cheap $5 ones that are hard as rocks. I've been really disappointed by most mechanical eyeliner pencils I've used they seem like they often require a lot of pressure to get a good line and are harder to cover everything evenly with. There's different types of pencils that will spread easier and can be easier to work with like oil based pens that look similar to liquid, but for me are easy to work with. Liquid is too unforgiving for me and my shaky hands and twitchy eyelids, but it looks really nice if you're good with it."

The other subs like this become private and only approved users are allowed in after mod review of their account.

The therapeutic, stress-relieving device was invented by Temple Grandin while she was attending college.    Autism and autism-spectrum disorders have profound effects upon both social interactions and sensitivity to sensory stimulation in persons with such conditions, often making it uncomfortable or impractical for them to turn to other human beings for comfort. Grandin solved this by designing the hug machine so both she and others could turn to it for sensory relief, when needed or simply desired.

transpassing,35ghj9,MewKat,1 point,Sun May 10 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"No, I only have one step-brother and was never really around him much growing up. I actually grew up being influenced by my older sisters more than anything >.>  I was probably really nervous while recording this too which doesn't help at all.  And no. I've thought about going to youtube videos but at the same time I want to just keep working on it solely on my own like I have been because for me it makes me feel more accomplished."
transpassing,35frez,Elliecarr,12,Sat May 9 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"Hi! Currently I'm reading you as a young male- maybe around 17 or 18? You have a great facial structure, and I believe eventually you will be read as female, possibly even without HRT. As far as tips, I'd suggest investing in a higher quality wig- this one has sort of a cheap, artificial shine to it. I would focus on your makeup technique, particularly in eyeshadow/eyeliner. Try adding some black eyeliner, maybe subtle wings and mascara. I would also try wearing something that emphasizes your shoulders less. Hope this helps!"
transpassing,35frez,negatonic,5,Sun May 10 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"Male, around twenty. I would agree about the wig, you need a better one, this one's too obviously a wig. Make up needs a little work, the eye shadow isn't a good color for you, I'd try something warmer. And a stronger or more refined eyeliner, like a wing. And mascara. Also blush, a rosy cheek goes a long way towards looking more feminine and soft."
transpassing,35frez,wsilver,5,Sun May 10 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"I'm reading young male. The wig is kind of awful. Invest in a better one, or wear your hair natural and learn how to make it look feminine. Headbands and mousse. For makeup, you need to get warmer. A little rosy blush, gold or taupe eyeshadow, mascara, and a sharp winged eyeliner."

transpassing,35ezyj,Finchington,1 point,Sat May 9 20:19:37 2015 UTC,"Very androgynous, lean towards male in most of the pics, female in the third. That might just be because of the hair, and the feminine angle of your camera, I'd lower it if you want a more masculine angle.   My guy friends always seem to make the look-down-at-the-camera mistake, and girls mostly look up at it. I If you bring it down to eye level it'll give a more accurate portrayal, it'll be less feminine, and it'll be more flattering than the doomy from below angle that some other guys do."

transpassing,35bm6y,GabiTheBitch,9,Fri May 8 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, hug boxing aside, you're too old for that hair style. The one-eye covered is more of an emo teen thing. You've got a lot of good going on, so don't hide it.  Your makeup has a little bit odd to it. I'm not sure what, but something is off. Maybe ask /r/MakeupAddiction to give you some tips there. I want to say it's highlighting/contouring that you need, but I'm not 100% sure.  Eyebrows look awesome, and you have a hooded eyelid like I do, so that is what it is.  Yes, ask /r/MakeupAddiction -- I think that's what you need. :-)  Keep up the great work! :-D"

I look like 17 years old, because HRT made me feel and act like I'm 17 :-D I even wrote an article about it on my blog, but unfortunately it's in Czech language only. Life is change, so I will try another hairstyle tommorow :)   Makeup: Yes, I look odd, because I have hyperpigmentation and 2nd degree burns on lower half of my face. It has been caused by laser facial hair removal set to maximum intensity and my stupidity, since I didn't use protective cream after session and got burned by sun. I hope it will heal in week or two. And to be honest, I'm terrible at contouring too. Definitely one of the makeup things I had been unable to handle since I got this advice here for the first time in January.

transpassing,3535e1,CorruptedReality,5,Wed May 6 18:37:54 2015 UTC,Your hair needs some volume. Having it so close to your head is very guy-style. Other than that in the pic of your face I can definitely see the inner girl. It looks like you have put eyeliner on your waterline. You want to try to get it only where your lashes grow on the bottom to really make your eyes look bigger. I like the smokey look though.  Try to stand straighter with your shoulders back. It will feel weird at first but will make you look more feminine.  Hope that helps.

transpassing,3535e1,mamablotto,1 point,Wed May 6 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Head over to /r/MakeupAddiction and practice your makeup skills and experiment with techniques.   For short hair, if you use a headband it will read as more feminine even if you just woke up and don't have time to fix your hair. I agree that the hair needs volume and you may want to buy a hair dryer if you do not already have one and practice using a round brush for volume.  I like the dress in the third pic a lot.  The outfit in the second photo reads more like a feminine gay male than as female (probably because of the shirt length pulling up). You need some longer shirts to cover your torso (look for things labeled 'boyfriend length'). The shorts are cute, but I also think that it would read as more female if they were longer."

To expand on the hair thing, I'm letting it grow a bit.

transpassing,350ber,Cat_Butt_Face,4,Wed May 6 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think you've got a lot to work with, focus on cleaning up the brows, then learning how and when to use makeup to accentuate your feminine features, which I would say are eyes and lips. Also that fringe needs help badly, your hair seems to be all over the place with long bits mixed in with short bits and all a bit of a mess. If you've got the length to work with aim for an actual style and go for it, the middle ground does nothing for you."
transpassing,350ber,Cat_Butt_Face,1 point,Wed May 6 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much. Brows were actually on the top of the to-do list, shouldn't be too much of a fuss I shouldn't think. And yeah, my hair's pretty bad. What style would you recommend for me? There's so many styles I love and I just haven't been able to pick one. I can't have one that's too feminine just yet though unfortunately because I'm still living as a male and closeted to most of my friends and family, so yeah, what d'ye think I should do about this one?"
transpassing,350ber,RedRock117,1 point,Wed May 6 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what type of workplace you have and such as to what's appropriate? Like, if you're allowed length then in boy mode I'd just keep it in a clean pony till you're free to wear it down. As for fringe, what you have is a good start but it all just needs to be cleaned up, like even out the length of your fringe, decide if you want it straight and blunt, or sideswept and longer, etc... Like not knowing you're exact situation it's hard to say ""get this exact cut!"" But I can say just make it cleaner and smoother, less fly away and more even length to the fringe"

Despite the creeps, the trolls and the WBC-ish people, the majority of the commenters said I do pass, which is completely unexpected for me because I've never been to HK since transitioning and I was really worried I might had a hard time surviving in such a predominant-Asian place. Especially I am 5'6"" tall, which is considered as really tall for average HK girls. (I look like a white girl in Asian's skin.)  And since the post went so viral, now most of my friends know now.

Your eye makeup and foundation are fantastic, it looks very natural with your hair color.  (Try not putting the lipstick all the way out to the edges of your lips. Stay just inside the lines. If you look at your lips without any makeup on, the color's brightest in the center and gets pale at the edges, especially the corners. Going all the way out to the edges tends to make mouths look too big.)"

transpassing,34p1xs,Araeza,6,Sun May 3 06:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming MtF? The first thing I think you need to do is work on a hairstyle. Your hair, while long, looks pretty typical of guys with long hair--it tends to be unstyled and lack body as well as being a bit frizzy. To deal with the frizziness, I would stop using a blow dryer (if you use one), stop using a bristled brush and switch over to a comb. Mostly though just play with your hair, figure out how to style it and add some body so it looks more feminine.   I would also recommend thinning your eyebrows just a little and adding some makeup--particularly mascara to make your eyes pop a bit more.   Your features are fairly soft--no hard angles--so if you can add makeup and hair I think you can pass pretty well."
transpassing,34p1xs,Sianna,2,Sun May 3 08:00:35 2015 UTC,"I came here to say pretty much the same. Your face alone is already very soft and feminine, a more feminine hairstyle and more defined brows should help you tremendously. I think you have so much potential! :-)"
transpassing,34p1xs,jerrysugarav,2,Sun May 3 10:44:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think some side swept bangs would look really lovely on OP. Eyebrows def need a tidy.  Also i know it sounds silly but some mascara would go a long way.
transpassing,34p1xs,kaorte,2,Sun May 3 12:25:37 2015 UTC,You're not hopeless at all. Three months is a relatively short time for hormones to do their thing in. Your face is already a good deal feminine. I do have to echo the sentiments on the styling of the hair though.
transpassing,34p1xs,zoey_something,2,Mon May 4 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm sorry for the late reply, Thank you all for your responses!  I have thought a lot about having bangs, I really want them but I'm apprehensive about getting them because I'm worried about how they'll look. If the general second opinion is that they'd look decent on my I think I might go for it. As for the frizziness in my hair...well it's sort of chronic. I've tried so many different ways to reduce the frizz but none of it seemed to help (different shampoos/conditioner, air drying, blow drying, etc). I'm terrified to do my eyebrows. I know it's necessary but I'm not very artistically inclined (I just know there's a 100% chance I'd fuck it up). And I'm still practicing with make up. It's not as permanent as my eyebrows, so I'm a little more adventurous, but I'm nowhere near good enough with it to let anyone see me with it on (I'm trying mainly eyeliner and mascara)."
transpassing,34p1xs,marilyn_cd,2,Mon May 4 06:18:04 2015 UTC,"Go for the bangs! Worst case scenario you don't like them and you have to grow them out. The nice thing about hair is that it will grow back out! :) I have frizzy hair curse as well. ugh!  Maybe you can have someone do your eyebrows for you or show you how to do it? It would be a useful skill. I am lucky mine look fine the way they are, but I wish I knew how to trim them!"

But today I decided to get out and enjoy life. My face is still a little swollen from laser on Monday but I thought I looked good enough to blend right in.

transpassing,34lj2n,creepynaomi,5,Sat May 2 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm going to commend her for making the effort and the article makes her intents seem genuine. Making people feel beautiful in their own bodies and comfortable with who they are is good. It's very good.  But I have to agree with a few others here. Already the title is fairly condescending. If anything at all it should be called helping or assisting, but most certainly not teaching. Like it's some either clandestine or established art that cis women have the grandeur to let trans women in on.  I just have to point out though that this may just be the slighted language and writing of the article. The journalist doesn't sound like they have any patronising intentions at all. More the opposite. They seem genuinely interested and open to the topic. I think it's just their stigmas, paradigms or just no previous exposition to trans* topics that make them write in such a way, which I would describe as disturbingly condescending.  Good intentions methinks, but unfortunately phrased and with a hint of indiscretion."
transpassing,34lj2n,MichelleMyTransBelle,8,Sat May 2 17:46:11 2015 UTC,Idk. Something about this makes me uncomfortable.

transpassing,34lj2n,MichelleMyTransBelle,4,Sat May 2 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Heck, if they believe that women need to act and look ""like a lady"" then a lot of cis women would need that help too.

Using the word ""teach"" here kind of makes sense, although another word would be better. A lot of trans women here look like they transitioned a little bit older, so they've been forced to act masculine in virutally every aspect (most likely). So they basically have to work on it the same way you break a bad habit, by teaching yourself not to do it. I look at the whole thing as positive, honestly. It seems like she's doing good for people, and I think there was even a line that said she worked with them to whoever they wanted to express their womanhood, so it's not like she's being a Nazi Womyn forcing them to behave like her otherwise they are not women."

transpassing,348mzv,Talia3289,10,Wed Apr 29 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"Def. work a fringe/bangs into your hair style, your hairline is a big tell and working against you, you've got enough length that adding some fringe won't be a big sacrifice to volume I don't think. Also you're over doing it with the eyeliner, you don't need to line so much on the inner waterline, it closes your eyes off and actually makes them look smaller, look up some tutorials on mua or you tube and you'll see a more open winged look is really in right now. Both small thing that I think would make big improvements :)"
transpassing,348mzv,Cat_Butt_Face,3,Wed Apr 29 06:44:40 2015 UTC,"I know everyone will say this, but those eyebrows need work. In the fourth picture, where you're pulling your hair back and raising your eyebrows, I immediately thought of vampires and Dracula. So that's not good.   Also, keep your chin up, literally! Don't point your face downwards! Just point your face upwards! It always looks nicer (for men and for women, it's just a generally good idea, and it'll definitely help you).   That's really all the criticism I can give you! You really look great overall! You've got a great smile, especially when you show your teeth like in the second picture, and it appears that you at least have a bit of hips, but I can't quite tell for certain from the pictures. So if you decide to start HRT, that should work out just fine.   Your jawline isn't that great, but there's nothing you can really do about that except for HRT. The good news is that if you ever go on HRT, your jawline will get worked out in a few months.   Basically you're already super cute and hormones would certainly fix up the rough areas. You just need to grow out your hair a bit more and take care of those eyebrows!"
transpassing,348mzv,mmhmmhmmhmm,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think you have a face that would look very feminine once on hormones (it already looks feminine now). I guess I'll just go the full gambit and say all the suggestions I have. Anyway, one thing is that I think you would look great with a lighter hair color. Specifically a dark red, auburn, or just a cooler-toned red in general. Probably auburn vs. the unnatural reds. It would go great with your pale skin. Right now, with your black hair, it's so harsh, and that masculinizes you, imo. The same thing is happening with your lip color. It's so dark that it comes off as harsh. Also, I think you should part your hair in the middle because how it's parted right now makes your receding hairline obvious and hurts your chances of passing (I have the same problem, so I say that with empathy! You actually have thicker hair than I do, so you have that). Everything else works, though. Your body is feminine, as is your dress, and whatever you did to give yourself boobs is working (the size fits you very well). One more thing I thought of is I've heard to never line your bottom lash line, and I think taking that advice would make you look softer and more feminine.  All in all, you are honestly really close to passing in these photos already. I would at least be confused as to what your gender was. But I'm pretty sure if I just saw you on the street for 5 seconds I would gender you female."

Head on it would be obvious and for a place such as transpassing if they posted a picture like that it wouldn't do very well. (not getting into why transpassing isn't great in that regard but moving on) But a picture at the right angle can hide those facts and they could end up looking very pretty. What your saying could be very true its just a lot of trans women have issues with their jaws and such and therefore this angle tends to create less than truthful images.

Also, if you find that it tends to be frizzy, try using a brush that isn't as harmful to the hair and brush it while it is wet. You can then put a small amount of mousse (like a fingertip amount) and run that through your hair.  Final tip, take your pictures from a slightly higher angle to show off your wonderful face.

Once you've got the eyebrows sorted and beard shadow concealed, using too much product makes you look more drag queen than woman.  Your hair is also a fairly masculine ""guy with long hair"" style.  Neaten it up and that'll really help swing to the female side.  Love the pink top, but the black jacket just sucks all the color out of the rest of you.  Probably why the makeup looks so stark."

Try it out for yourself, but it is something I've noticed. I also don't think your current style looks ""guy with long hair"" really. Also PLEASE don't brush your hair, as you probably already knew from having curly hair that that is never a good idea. Head over to /r/curlyhair and find out more about the Curly Girl method.  Makeup-wise, I would say go thinner on the eyeliner, thinner on the brows, and curl your lashes and add mascara."
transpassing,345rgy,laurenbug2186,2,Tue Apr 28 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Do NOT do bangs with your hair. Ever. They will turn into little springs, or if you brush them they'll be a big puff. Trust me, i have the same kind of hair."
transpassing,345rgy,unixbeardxd,2,Tue Apr 28 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"With the hair,  go for a clean center part, symmetrical look, or a tight high braid. Either way, it needs a good brush and care.  Check out /r/FancyFollicles for some inspiration.  Now, makeup... under-eye concealer, same over the beard/mustache area. Add some lipstick, you have a very nice Cupid's Bow on your upper lip, make the most of that.    I'd also go with full face foundation, and avoid the blush until you are better practiced.  It's too far forward and too bold.  I think the color is fine, you were just a bit heavy handed with it.  For the eyes, sharpen your eyeliner pencil, lines are a bit smudged.  Keep the lines crisp and within the eye.  Don't extend the eyeliner until you are more practiced and no longer stabbing your eye.  Also, mascara.  It'll bring your eyelashes out better and frame your eyes.  Eye shadow color is too dark, something more neutral would be great, something light but close to your natural eye color or skin tone.  It's really just learning the techniques.  /r/MakeupEducation is a good learning resource, as is /r/BeautyDiagrams.  Once a bit more practiced, hit up /r/sugarfreemua to get some feedback from more experts, just be ready for heavy honesty.  Above all - practice and don't get down on yourself if you don't do a good job.  You've got a lot of learning and catching up to do.  No shame in learning and failing occasionally."

Head over to /r/curlyhair- a couple of products and you'll be rocking some seriously awesome curls.   As for make up, this is a pretty good first attempt. I would definitely focus on neating up your brows (sharp brows read feminine) and practicing your winged eyeliner- it's hard to get the right shape at first so I would just keep on trying until you've got the hang of it. I found Lisa Eldridge and Pixiwoo are two youtubers who really helped with my eyeliner skills.

It's just the first photo where you look like a guy in your face. I think it's the slight facial hair shadow you have, your nose, and the fact that your eyebrows are too far apart and don't really have an arch. The nose rule doesn't always work. I find a better rule to be that they should be and eye-width apart - measure the width of your eye and make them that far apart. Or rather, don't pluck past there (if your eyebrows are naturally not that close, it's ok). The rule I think should be followed (only for those who want to follow beauty rules, of course) is that the farthest apart your eyebrows should be is to the inside of your eyes. Don't have them begin past the inside corners of your eyes. It just begins to look crazy after that."

transpassing,340a20,emmafree,5,Mon Apr 27 07:34:38 2015 UTC,"No-one's going to shoot you down! Maybe work on your hair first off - if you can style it to minimise the height of the hairline, esp. either side of your temples that will help a lot. The last pic looks the most feminine - you've got some good features to work with and accentuate - a rounded chin helps, and you have quite large, open eyes all of which you'll be able to accentuate once you're inducted into the dark arts of makeup ;)"

transpassing,340a20,Godrics,2,Mon Apr 27 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think you pass very well, minus the hair. While you're still learning to style and your hair is coming back in and growing out, it might help you to perhaps use some toppik and perhaps style with a headband across the part of the bangs, which may help keep them in place."

transpassing,33ui9l,MayTentacleBeWithYee,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"Late comment, but I think you'd probably pass as female (you have a pretty feminine face). However, I think you should style your hair differently, if possible, until it grows out. I think your best bet might be to try and give yourself a more defined parting, and have your hair sweep across from there and make it look choppy, and less ""textured"" if you can. Also, it's a pretty small detail, but you could perhaps wear some kind of lipstick/gloss and try to make your lips look more like this, it might help. :)"
transpassing,33ui9l,MayTentacleBeWithYee,2,Sun Apr 26 21:26:47 2015 UTC,"I'm trying on the hair.... it's hard!!! My hair is really, really thick.  I actually do use lipstick."
transpassing,33u632,AgenderTypo,5,Sat Apr 25 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'd start by growing your hair out. You could do a lot with longer hair, from sweeping it back into a pompadour to wearing it shaggy and more feminine.   Male jewelry is typically thicker and much simpler. If you want to get some more female rings, bracelets, etc, go for it. They'll be dressier and flashier.  Shirts with high collars close to the neck are very male. Things that leave a bit of collarbone and neck exposed tend to be more female. V-neck t shirts still look pretty male, though.  If you like piercings, nose piercings are pretty androgynous, especially a septum, and gives you an extra option for jewelry.   There's not really androgynous underwear, sadly. But you could try women's underwear if you're feeling curious.  A tiny bit of eyeliner at the outside corners of your eyes can make you look really feminine, too, without overdoing the makeup. And grooming your eyebrows (with tweezers or getting them waxed) can make your whole face look much more feminine.   More fitted pants are definitely more androgynous. Straight leg especially.   If you're comfortable with your eye, you don't have to fix it. Do it for you, not to impress anyone. But if it's giving you problems I'd consider getting it fixed. Your eyes have a pretty color naturally, too."

transpassing,33u632,gaijin_smash,3,Sun Apr 26 02:04:22 2015 UTC,No problem!  Another thing I forgot--ear piercings are becoming really androgynous and can add some uniqueness to your style.

Feedback on passing: I am really digging the hair/eyebrows/earrings/smile! (all those in my eyes pass, actually, they look really pretty) I can still see the rough-ness around the chin and mustache area. (which HRT should fix, as well as even out the bone structure)  Really my only qualm with this look is the t-shirt.  I LOVE the v-neck look on you, with the necklace, but the skin tight-ness isn't very flattering to your shape. (especially with the pineapple, it draws attention to your tummy)  Hints on passing would be to do some research on how to dress to fit your body type! This website had some good tips, and lots of photo's as examples: http://i.imgur.com/lsIM9Si.jpg  You look great, looking forward to your development:) ALSO in case I came off harsh: It took me like 18 years to understand fashion, and I still wear shitty outfits years later.

If you know a hairdresser that seems to care about what hair you actually want, maybe you can ask them for assistance or suggestions :)  I suggest looking into make-up tutorials though. Not sure if you have freckles because my phone can't tell quality that well, but if they are freckles, covering them might help you.  Also found his https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQVzQrCEGgo advice insightful. I would never tell you to directly copy anything, but maybe it could assist or inspire you. Drawing over your eyebrows to make them thicker / more pronounced is also something that comes to mind.  Using mascara to indicate a beard shadow could look good if you don't overdo it to the point of obvious paint. Looking at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AUta2KKtpc, I think if you did it a little bit but not as much as them, maybe that would help you out. Experiment a bit and figure out what works for you :)  Good luck mate! ~* ~*"

It's like putting your body into hard mode for burning fat while everyone else is set on normal mode. If you may have a thyroid condition def. get that checked out right away because that can effect more than your weight and really needs to be treated.

It may be helpful to go to a professional salon for this at first; they'll do it really nicely, and it'll show you how they look when done. Try some mascara or eye makeup.

It may just be the way you're tensing your muscles, but I think a change to the eyebrows would transform your face. If you want to look more masculine, I'd give yourself lower, thicker eyebrows. High, arched, tapered eyebrows soften a face and give it femininity. This picture shows what I'm trying to say."

Besides if you're doing your brows you'll be filling in everything anyway so a bald spot won't be noticeable, I had one for a long time where I had a scar running thru mine and I rocked that shit when I went w/o makeup, it was a Viking battle scar! So yeah, let the brows grow back in and then watch some tutorials on how to properly shape them cause they're the worst part of this pic. You def. have come a long way from the start but I still would be unsure how to read you, I'd think AMAB but I'd probably use the feminine pronoun on you depending upon how you carried yourself.

transpassing,331tg9,evendeathmaydie,3,Sun Apr 19 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"I still read you as female, mate, sorry. Just my two cents, but this might possibly help a little:  -Lower and looser shorts. For female clothes one always bought the smallest size that fit you comfortably. However, I've lately realized that at least I feel a lot better when my pants are a bit looser than that. When you look at guys, I think most actually use a size or two larger pants than they could, because they want some extra space for the dingly bits. Having the pants hang lower helps disguise the waist/hips-ratio.  -T-shirt with shorter and smaller sleeves. You have nice sturdy arms, but those sleeves make them seem smaller than they actually are."
transpassing,331tg9,evendeathmaydie,3,Sun Apr 19 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good poing, thanks! I tend to buy shirts on the internet, so I guess I need to do more real life shopping then. thanks for the feedback!"

They break the texture of the cloth, which hides binder lines and/or bulges from the front, they hide the shape of chest from the side, they give you more defined shoulders and they hide the sweat stains in t-shirts if you happen to live somewhere really warm. Bonus points if you happen to score one with epaulets, because epaulets make everything awesome."
transpassing,331tg9,Sianna,2,Sun Apr 19 22:33:19 2015 UTC,You need a binder and a packer. The testosterone should slim your hips down (a bit) but you need to do the rest of the body work yourself.

transpassing,32zgf5,DrGrizzley,7,Sat Apr 18 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth:  The longer dress appears to add bulk to the top portion of your body.  The detail (compared to the non-detailed rest) draws the eye upward.  Personally I think it's broadening your shoulders, especially when you are turned around.  Also, all the blackness just seems to be making the rest of your body almost shapeless, because of the bold, contrasting pattern on top.  The shorter dress is better, the horizontal lines really work with your body.  I see that the lines define your waist more, and it flairs out a bit giving you a wider hip.  However, the shoulders look off to me, and it's the design itself.  The shoulders just kinda go slightly off onto your arms and it looks like it's broadening them.  Also the neckline doesn't plunge so you don't get the added effect of drawing the eyes downward, which might make your shoulders/top portion of your body slimmer.  Also, I totally hope you enjoy your prom! Is it your first one?  edit: added some wordz"

transpassing,32npv1,WilliamTRiker,15,Wed Apr 15 06:38:33 2015 UTC,"This is a very flattering angle for you. I can't really tell how you look in real life, but if this is pretty accurate to how you look most of the time, I question how your boymode is working at all. I guess either you look less girlish from another angle, or maybe everyone in your life is looking at you going, ""when is she going to change her name already? no one could mistake her for a guy!""   Two things are standing out to me as immediately fixable: your eyebrows and your hairstyle. Right now, your bangs are too long, so you're kinda pushing them to the side to keep them out of your eyes. This can work if you have a lot of hair at the part, but if your hair is very fine/thin, then it shows too much of your scalp and looks kinda combover-ish. Look at this girl's roots at her part. You can see that her hair is very fine, but her bangs don't look that thin because she's keeping the fringe short enough that it can be pulled straight forward. When you brush your bangs forward, you get more hair from the top of your scalp, whereas brushing your bangs over and across your forehead pushes the hair on the top of your head over to the side, so you end up trying to force a tiny lock of front-of-the-scalp hair to cover up your entire hairline. When you go to your stylist, say, ""I want side-swept bangs where I can brush more of my hair forward without it falling into my eyes.""   I think there are two questions that we try to answer here on transpassing: ""Is this person's appearance within expected norms for their gender?"" and ""Is this person's appearance the best that it could be for them personally, in context of the gender they're trying to present?"" Your eyebrows would get a yes to the first question--I have most certainly seen cis girls whose eyebrows look exactly like that--but to the second question, I think the answer is no, they're not the best that you could do. The color you're using to fill them in is way too dark for your face (the general rule is two shades lighter for dark hair, and two shades darker for light hair), it's applied with a very heavy hand (not much attention given to how naturally full, dark eyebrows would actually look) and I see what looks like smudges above your eyebrows (indicating either that you've touched your face because you're not used to wearing makeup, or that the original application wasn't careful enough).   The overall effect is that your eyebrows look like a really young (like high school) girl's attempt to do her eyebrows in an edgy way. I say edgy because the black eyebrows were really common among alternative emo/scene girls when I was in high school, and in order to do that look right, the whole thing has to be really clean, which a lot of people new to makeup aren't really capable of. The easiest thing to do is just to switch your eyebrow pencil. Even if you change nothing else about the application, just wearing a more matching reddish-brown color will instantly make you look more mature and less newbish.   If you're following /r/MakeupAddiction, every now and then people will post a ""brow journey"" post. You can see that filling in eyebrows really doesn't come naturally to most people, and there's a lot of leeway for girls to have weirdly-filled-in eyebrows without getting clocked. After you've found a better color match, you can kinda teach yourself at your own pace how to get cleaner lines, how to lighten up the color of the tails and the inner corners to for a more natural gradient, how to change the shape you fill them in to best suit your look, etc. but you don't have to worry too much about passing/not passing if your eyebrows aren't on point."

Truthfully, my makeup skills are entirely trial and error and trying to match pictures of girls I know who I find attractive (yes, many of us were members of those subcultures).

Getting your brows more feminine would def. help, I know thick brows are in now but getting them shaped and blended right is going to help loads, use a pencil one shade darker than your hair if you want to go dark, but never black unless your hair is naturally black. Eye makeup for me is key, I usually make sure I have some liner, wings are great, and mascara and a basic foundation and blush/blender if I really want to read femme that day. Blush or shaders can really help accentuate your cheekbones and people seem to read that as ""girl"" for me. Your hair is okay but I second that a thicker, shorter fringe would help. I prefer a blunter cut because it shows a definite cut/style and helps form a shape to the hair."

transpassing,32m8m1,bb411114,2,Wed Apr 15 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"50/50 but their are some simple changes you can make in a photo to lean things feminine or masculine. If at all possible try and take a photo with no shadows on your face. Shadows create masculine angularity. Where as no shadows erase angularity and create a smoother look.   You took this photo with it just slightly pointing up to you. Meaning the camera was below you even just slightly this can create a masculine look in the photo. Taking a photo with the camera above the subject (you) is a good way to add a more feminine look, and feel to the photo.   Girls typically put more effort into their outfits. As a result girls typically wear things that have desgines, layers, lines, polka-dots, or something else besides plain t-shirts. This is helpful as it adds a layer of femininity, while also distracting from more masculine facial features. Something like what /u/KaileeCd did here is a great example.   Also remember to smile smiling does a lot more than makes you look happy. It can bend the eyes slightly. Erasing some angularity in the face. It can heighten, and show off cheek bones, as well smooth a jaw line in thinner faces like yours. Which is actually a good thing as it shows of curves in the face."
transpassing,32m8m1,bb411114,2,Thu Apr 16 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"Good ideas.   The shirt is actually striped.  It just isn't apparent from the portion visible.  I never wear plain stuff.  I actually refused to wear a T-shirt my whole life.  Found it too lazy and ugly.  I wear feminine outfits.  Always been stylish.  It ought to be noted that I'm trying to pass in real life, not the photo.  I don't want to convey an unrealistic image; not everyone looks down on me, and I don't always smile.  But good advice for normal selfies!  Thanks."
transpassing,32m8m1,putyourayguntomyhead,2,Thu Apr 16 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"I am mostly good for passing in photos (I am a photographer). However their are some things that you can do in real life as well. The left side of your face looks really feminine I think maybe you have eye makeup on that really looked good, or just stands out on that eye. I would apply that to both eyes.   You have your eyebrows are trimmed nice, your cheeks have some color, and honestly your skin is amazing. Your chin is a problem area (at least it looks that way to me.) Try to draw more attention away from it with lipstick probably a particularly noticeable eye catching color.   Being 50/50 is a good place to be at 15 honestly. It allows you apply simple edits and create a more feminine look. Or simply go out and still look almost feminine. HRT is going to treat you well."

Don't be afraid of color, especially around your eyes. You can make them look bigger by highlighting the inner corners and brow bone with a light color. Trying different colors is the best way to figure out what works best for you. Also, hitting the outside corner just around the lid line with a dark tone will add some depth and interest. Eye liner is a godsend but it takes patience and practice. Watch some YouTube videos on contouring. It's easy once you know how and it makes a world of difference. I like a nice nude lip mostly but I go for a rich purple or red if I'm going out at night and want to get noticed. Otherwise, practice makes perfect and don't waste money on cheap makeup that's bad for your skin. You're all set. Good luck, girl!"

A friend of mine went through cancer treatment and was told to purchase wigs, but then to take them to the hair stylist for a cut.  Why?  Because the perfection is what makes it obvious that it's fake.    O.P. I think your hair looks like typical female growing out hair.  I also envy you your hairline.  I am cis and don't have a nice hairline as it is very high.  I don't do bangs as they tend to only hang on my forehead and aren't attractive so I soften the look with a -> slight <- side part.  I personally think you look great and happy.  It's the joy coming out of your eyes that strikes me the most.  Yup, that's not constructive, but it is what I notice.

Either way, I would say I'm gendered correctly 98-99% of the time after having surgery with Facial Team, and those are good odds.  I just uploaded a side profile photo, but it was only about a month after surgery, so keep in mind my face (particularly my nose) was still a bit swollen. http://imgur.com/GsX6Nww  Unfortunately I don't have any good profile photos of the jawline work, but I'm going to take some for their before/after photos on the website soon, and I'll share them when I do.

transpassing,32fk8k,AlexaviortheBravier,9,Mon Apr 13 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"I don't personally think they're thick, they have a great shape too. Taking like one row of hairs from under may make it look like there is more space between her eye and brow ridge. But I don't think it's that important. They really are nicely shaped eyebrows.  Her eyebrows are really dark though and with the light hair, it really draws a lot of attention to the brow. It's hard to look at much else because they just command so much attention.  It's so cliche, but everything else is wonderful. The eyes brows just stand out so much and it's not exactly where the attention should be."
transpassing,32fk8k,Softvent,2,Mon Apr 13 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, its the contrast that makes them stand out, rather than the brows themselves.  She has so many soft features, thinner brows would just seem to suit her."

I don't really feel I've the right to call them out on it because people that do see me as female refer to me as such, and I've always believed if I actually pass people would be embarrassed to misgender me in front of strangers and switch pronouns anyway. I guess there's just enough people that haven't to make me question what more I can work on if they don't see/hear me the way I want them to?"

An alternative is bolder makeup in general but youd have to experiment with that. Usually girls with thick eyebrows wear thick liquid eyeliner, deep hues of eyeshadow, and maroon or othwerwise dark lipstick. Think ""hard femme"".  If heavy makeup or eyebrow lithtening doesnt work id get a lip stain a few shades darker than your natural lip color to make them look more flushed and bring balance to where peoples eyes look. I like the marker style ones and dont use any balm on top.  You look great, and are passing as cis already."

I've been on an eye brow journey for 1.5 years now, and still going. You have a much better starting point than I did. If you want help with a flattering brow shape, I recommend posting to /r/makeupaddiction or the sugarfree version. There's a golden ratio.

My eye brow plan is don't pluck for shape until I've noticed its time, and then wait a few days and really think about where needs to be plucked. Perhaps only plucking a hair or two at a time. I pluck for maintenance (away from shape) regularly in between"

transpassing,32fme9,AutumnFaeri,17,Mon Apr 13 12:13:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have trouble looking in the mirror and still seeing their birth gender, so just because someone passes well doesn't mean they can see that and they just want outside criticism. And even if someone knows they pass, it is in the rules that you can post your picture just because you want to.  I also haven't seen people suggesting ffs as often as you're suggesting. Usually whenever I see someone suggest it, the person has a very masculine jaw or large brow bossing. Bangs are not a substitute for ffs as they do nothing to change the face shape, they only cover your forehead. I've never seen someone tell a person who passes greatly to get ffs.  I will agree that sometimes people will tell people they need work just because they aren't very attractive, even if they pass just fine. That is definitely a problem.  Usually people suggest normal hair colors and short hair for trans guys because those things make you look feminine, and while that's not a bad thing, most trans guys I see posting here are either pre-T or haven't been on T for very long so those things aren't going to help them pass. That's what the purpose of this sub is, trying to help people pass better.  Side note: I can definitely see the whole FTM exclusionary language people are talking about. Everything was about trans women until the very last line."

This is what I think the big reason is. Apparently I pass (you can look through my post history if you want) but I still don't see it. I post here to get feedback to not only improve how I look, but in the hopes that these improvements will help ME see how I look to others."
transpassing,32fme9,laurenloves,3,Mon Apr 13 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"I for one try my best to offer constructive criticisms only-- if it's not something that can be fixed without hormones or surgery, I usually don't bring it up.  Like a few others have said, how well a person passes to you may be very different to how they feel-- so I just usually compliment them on a job well done!  Also, sure fem guys and masculine girls exist. Nobody should feel like the have to change their personal style, but when someone comes here looking for passing tips, I assume they want to do what they can to pass better."
transpassing,32fme9,4shmd,3,Mon Apr 13 17:46:33 2015 UTC,You do forget that many of us grow up among people that know us before transition and even if they pass it can be confusing due to the constant negative reinforcement from parents or friends or family.  I've been told I pass yet my family for instance - they don't see it the same way and u always have that feeling wondering if you are being overconfident. Often too you are embedded in a social circle where your reputation precedes you and it's never the same look from people when you are outed before hand. Hindsight is 20/20 and u get people who know and feel they can totally tell.   It's something that transcends the mirror. To be honest we also tend to have lower self esteem and tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to passing . If it happens among younger ones more it totally makes sense - think of the people they hang out with first. Eg in school especially when you have people surrounding you that have seen you grow up.
transpassing,32fme9,girlorguythrowaway,2,Tue Apr 14 00:31:50 2015 UTC,"As [mostly] trans-people ourselves, we know what to look for. We know the give-aways, the hints of trans-ness peeking through. We inspect far more closely than the average person on the street."

Not everyone views themselves the same.   And when it comes to trans guys, especially feminine ones, fem guys exists too, if some dude wants to dye his long hair surely that's possible, there should be other ways to make him look masculine except short hair surely.   wtf? No. If you wanna be man great, if you wanna look like one, cut your fucking hair. Just because some people have a warped view of masculinity from anime doesn't mean its the truth.   When people don't know you're trans, they don't search for overly masculine features and point those out   Yes they do, that's called getting clocked.   I don't pass myself and want FFS but like most, I don't have a pot of gold hanging next to my room.   Get a job, you can make 70k a year delivering pizzas and FFS is only like 20-40k."

I had a HS teacher from Cali, said you can make $20/hr at McDonald's but you'd still be in poverty there, where as here in MN 20/hr is nice and a McDonald's worker makes $9.00 unless they're a manager.

I'm a bigger dude myself, so what I usually do is I get shirts that fit loosely and don't cling to my body, as that reveals my round feminine figure, and then I always tuck them in.

Going low maintenance is fine, but I think when you're trying to sell a female image going an extra step, like makeup, just gives it that added oomph that sells the full package.

As I said, I would ask her out, but since I am not likely to, here are some thoughts.  As for the beard shadow, I have dated women who needed constant waxing and cover-up for moustaches and beards.  And I knew they were born women because I celebrated the births of their children.  I made the assumption (obviously erroneously) that she already understands cover-up makeup, and I was just recommending that she does not entertain the ""Tammy Faye"" look.  Obviously, you do not want the opinion of someone who could provide some constructive feedback, because you succeeded in downvoting me from 3 pts to 0 in a span of 30 minutes.

I'd suggest something like a halter-top with ruffles. A halter-top alone may help.   Also, I can't really tell from the pictures but the bottom unfortunately seems a bit bulgy (Sorry!). Maybe consider wearing some shorts over them. Like sort of a short gym short. They actually do make swim shorts for girls. Even a board short could help.

For a first try, you're doing alright.  How about this? Keep the jean jacket, pair it with something simple like capris or chinos, and then find a nice tank top. There's one outfit right there, plus summer is right around the corner and it's probably still good for mid-spring and early fall, depending on where you live.

I also got a cream-ish cardigan, so maybe that's better?  Here's a picture I took today with that outfit. Sorry for the bad lighting and noisy photo.

transpassing,31texx,VolcanicVaranus,3,Wed Apr 8 09:05:51 2015 UTC,"Flehmen response:       The flehmen response (/ˈfleɪmən/; German: [ˈfleːmən]), also called the flehmen position, flehmen reaction, flehming, or flehmening, is a behaviour whereby an animal curls back its upper lips exposing its front teeth, inhales with the nostrils usually closed and then often holds this position for several seconds. It may be performed over a site or substance of particular interest to the animal (e.g. urine or faeces) or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air. Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals including ungulates and felids. The behaviour facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.

With my face shape I am very puzzled about what hair style would work. I am starting late in life so I have that against me also.

transpassing,31r8ns,dissolvedplasma,2,Wed Apr 8 01:52:54 2015 UTC,"Don't get discouraged!  I really don't agree that you won't be able to be able to transition without plastic surgery.   You may never have really full lips, but if you watch some lip makeup videos and you'll be able to create an illusion.   And there are plenty of girls with your bone structure. It may not be the ""norm"" but it's not unheard of.   Overall I would take it as a grain of salt and just wait. Which it seems like you are already doing. Good luck!"
transpassing,31sij1,MyFaceOnFire,2,Tue Apr 7 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"In that pic I wouldn't say you pass, maybe at a quick glance because your face is still round and if your mannerisms were typical.  If you step up your makeup game a bit more though I think you'd look really good. Foundation and blush can really help and a pink lip doesn't exactly suit you being so fair complected and all. Your eye makeup has the general idea right but needs a few more times practicing application. You're young so it doesn't need to be perfect but being trans it really helps   As a warning-beware using too much blush, you want it to look like your blushing not like sunburn."
transpassing,31sij1,JaseyRaeRadio,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:45:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm working on mannerisms, and considering hair extensions.  I was doing more with my makeup, but my mom (in her 50's, and from a relatively conservative family) thinks that I was overdoing it.  Won't let me leave the house with full makeup.  Hell, she only puts on makeup once or twice a month, and very badly even then.  So she does not understand the use of makeup at all.  Also, I used a red lipstick, but again my mom made me stop because it made me look ""whoreish"".  Ugh."

I hate bangs as my hair always ends up in my eyes, so a side part it is for me too.  You also are a natural blonde, as am I, so your eyebrows are invisible.  You may want to fill them in a little, a little goes a long way, and have your brows plucked or threaded, for shape."
transpassing,31smuc,murmalerm,2,Tue Apr 7 22:48:25 2015 UTC,"Will consider all of that, though whenever I've tried a side part Ive felt like its no longer hiding parts of my face that I'd rather stay hidden, if that makes sense."
transpassing,31smuc,murmalerm,2,Tue Apr 7 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"Did you try only a slight side part, even google ""slight side part?""  You don't have to go dramatically to the side.  It softens the lines of the face.  I'm a 5' 10'' cis female and I have to do that as well to break up a strong and masculine bone structure."

transpassing,31lhjo,QuiSumI,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:01:58 2015 UTC,"There's no way to know exactly how much chest/belly hair you will lose, but HRT should clear at least some of it up. You can expect slower growth and lighter, softer hair. Of course, the standard for acceptable chest hair on women is quite low, and many women feel any such hair is unacceptable.  You may need to laser it off, or you may not. Best recommendation is to focus on facial hair for now and see where your hormone experience takes you."

It's a bummer fact that most cismen have a straighter body, so we kinda lack the hips yaknow? I like to do that whole 2005 Avril Lavigne thing where I tie jackets around my waste to give the impression of hips.

transpassing,31m4fb,Uhmheslying,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"I think you look tired just because your eyelids and eyes don't give the wide eyed look. Make up can enhance that and so can just like opening your eyes a bit wider for pictures. If you do go out of your way to open your eyes wider do note that it takes some getting used to. Otherwise it looks totally obvious and awkward.  Overall you look more feminine to me, but if you said you were male I wouldn't dispute that either.

transpassing,31kzij,JocelynWonderland,2,Mon Apr 6 01:58:18 2015 UTC,Going off the title and comparing top previous pics I'm assuming you are definitely going for a more feminine presentation.   This is definitely a step towards a more decidedly femme direction but it is also a fairly common style for dudes to try to pull. The extreme guyliner + sideswept black bangs thing is always a style if not the style. Also kind of a guyish vneck.  Regarding the eyeliner maybe don't go so extreme on the tail? I also like to go in on the lower lash line but not all the way because that closes off the eye and makes it look smaller. But maybe a third or quarter of the way in can really make your eyes pop.   Things are not dire. You're learning. I'm learning. This is a time to try and be excited (even if it's hard)

If this is an option, try and look up some basic make up tutorials: I'm sure there are some floating around in /r/mtf or somewhere. Just play around with make up.

transpassing,31b1ld,CallMeKali,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:08:12 2015 UTC,I was not attacking or intending hostility. I wrote it as deadpan as I could though I understand tone is difficult to convey over text. I consider what I said to be very important semantics as it is a micro aggression to imply that trans people are not born as the sex they identify as and wanted to point this out to the ally and offer an alternative word that is much more supportive. I hope this clarifies my meaning and I apologize if I sounded sharp--I only intended to be straightforward.
transpassing,31b1ld,AppleSpicer,3,Sat Apr 4 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've been in Internet groups since the days of bulletin boards. We have been attacking each other over what term we think others should use for decades. Every few years we make up some new term and instantly expect the world to use it. What I think the criticism is about is that we should limit this type of discussion of semantics among ourselves and not try to hold other totally supportive people to the standard of knowing the ""term du jour"". Your correcting her was uncalled for. She will pick up the terminology on her own. Some find this constant bickering over semantics and our enforcement of whatever term you think should be used as offensive. I think that you meant no offense. I'm just giving my thoughts on why you and the rest of the community should just let semantics go."

transpassing,31bkbt,queenki,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:12:50 2015 UTC,I tell them I'm gay i mean ppl assume i am   I see. I took a slightly different path to transitioning. Years before I started HRT I began growing out my hair under the premise that I wanted to experience having long hair before it all fell out as all the male members of my family are bald or balding to some degree. So for me when I started to transition there was less of an expectation that I might have been gay.   I don't deny I'm gendered as female though most of the time   That's interesting... So you have been asked about your gender by others?

My family still thinks I'm gay :( I don't know if that will work for me since I'm growing out my hair now.   Gender wise, I think I confuse people often. I mean I don't look super femme. more like butch / androish. then they may get confused if I tell them I'm a guy. I do try to act more masculine though in my mannerisms so that might be the reason."
transpassing,31bkbt,EpiplecticBicycle,2,Fri Apr 3 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"My dad used to think I was gay. I got asked whether I preferred girls or boys by him once. I told him girls, not because I wanted an easier life, but because it was the truth. I only recently came out to both my parents.  I confuse people all the time. One example was a few weeks back. I was at the phone shop and I needed to talk about upgrading my phone so I told the guy my birth assigned name as that is the name currently on the account. The look on his face was priceless as he tried to process what I was saying to him.  You may not think you look femme, but you'd be surprised what others think. The mind does take a while to catch up to the bodily changes. Joe Public doesn't know you are transitioning, so all they will see is a woman."

Ideally with human hair, but they can get really pricey. I have a cheap synthetic one I got off of amazon that looks okay if you're tight on money. It's pretty easy to see that it's a wig if you examine it closely/try to run your fingers through it though. In any case it probably wouldn't hurt to try out a cheap wig first to find a style/color that you like and if you're even okay with wigs (I get itchy/sweaty easily in mine, especially now that things are heating up).

If you've got your glasses prescription, you can order direct from them for unbelievable prices.  And it's not cheap crap either - my wife ordered her glasses from them in 2006 and they're still doing fine, and they cost a whopping total of $12.

Me, I think I might've been unsure but, if so, asking myself specifically ""is this person perhaps male?""  Your best of these five, to me, is the fourth. It's a slightly more direct gaze, which helps. Consider looking into the research on gender presentation in advertising--the classic work is Goffman's Gender Advertisements, but there's a lot out there examining the communication of gender through posture. Hardly essential to figure out, particularly as these conventions seem to be easing over time, but something to think about/experiment with.  What's throwing me most and initially gave me pause is your eyebrows. Looking at the first photo, they don't seem to extend far out above the eye. That bare stretch of supraorbital ridge over the eye puzzles me, as I don't often see brows so narrow even in women. If that's how they naturally are, then no big, but if not, I'd advise letting them grow out.  With a more head-on gaze and/or fuller brows, I'd say leave the glasses alone unless you dislike them yourself. I think they look pretty good and that switching them out wouldn't change my impression."

If i'm ever in the position to get it done i probably will, but i'm not counting dimes to get there. i think for transgender people in general we have a hard time  (particularly in regards to ourselves) distinguishing between pretty and passing. thank you for a good morning comment haha (i love having a comment when i get up in the morning!) :D"

transpassing,3143om,nambyhamby,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"A great tip for your eyebrows (if you do them yourself or go to get them done) is to have the inner part go slightly higher. take this example, the eyebrows are slightly higher. Because of the way yours are placed, it exaggerates the forehead.  Ps. you don't want to be friends with me because I will ""borrow"" all of your cute clothes! ;)"

transpassing,314tgg,CarnivorousSheep,4,Fri Apr 3 09:32:58 2015 UTC,"Do you still do your eyebrows? They look really well groomed, and that can read a little  more feminine.

I hope I don't break any rules or offend you, but I wanted to contribute some honest feedback. Straight, white, CIS male if it matters to anyone.  You're over thinking it sometimes when a camera is on you. In the most candid pics, your true inside you matches your outside self. In pics 2,3,5, & 7 there is just something in your eyes that says you are in your own head, trying to pass like it is an acting gig and you're playing a role but aren't sure you can do it. It affects your posture and facial expressions in ways that I can see as a guy that other guys do when they are thinking about having their picture taken more than the moment itself. Hard to describe specifically though but it's there. Maybe I can see it though because you asked me to look.  My advice is to let go of whatever doubt you have left and just be the you you've been inside the whole time. You're doing fine."

transpassing,311511,evendeathmaydie,5,Thu Apr 2 04:57:04 2015 UTC,Yeah thick eyebrows are kind of in right now and this is them the day after they'd been done by a professional.   I've been told they are pretty much perfect so I think what you're reacting to is that their thickness contributes to the masculine aspects of the photo like the hairline and the stubble.

I don't personally wear sleeves tops, and if I do, I'm reeeally picky about it. 3/4 length sleeves are you friend! They cut the arm off at such flattering angles!  Also, long tunic tops.

By this I mean the sides should be more similar in length to the top (pref. a bit longer) and style your hair in quite a conservative way.   You do look good but we have to sacrifice chic-ness for passing as pre-T guys! Good thing is that you have a masculine structure to your face so providing your mannerisms, dress sense, and voice patterns are lined up, it would be odd if you did not pass.  Good luck!! :)"

As pre-T dudes we have to not only be masculine, but be definitely non-feminine in our cues which means distancing ourselves as much as possible from the butch lesbian/alternative girl styles. This haircut suits you a lot but it's also semi common in the alt girl circles, so it could lead strangers who are on the fence about your gender to go for female rather than male.   Hope this helps, obviously this is just my opinion! Can I ask where you come from? I'm from rural/small city England so obviously that influences how I treat passing."

As in, often patriarchal and inherently oppressive people that need to be kept in check. Trans men are just as liable to engage in violence (including rape) as cis men are, with the added defense of crying 'transphobia' and having the community rally around them, because misogyny and queers love masculinity. Lots of articles are out there about the trans dudebro phenomenon  I've been sexually harassed by dozens of late transitioners and sexually assaulted by three. Articles about creepy behavior and their actions abound and are the most common bits of TERF hate fodder because they're true far too often.  Queer communities, by and large, are masculinity circlejerks - ever heard of the 'invisible femme'? This also enables sexual violence by masculine of center AFAB folks - the most sickening example I've see so far involved a trans male rapist playing the victim and accusing his trans female victim of being the rapist, effectively depriving her of her friends. Nonbinaries also like to pretend that since they're not 'men', they don't have male privilege, shutting down an analysis of the matter."

The phrase was popularised as a feminist meme after @sassycrass made the following tweet in February 2013:   ME: Men and boys are socially instructed to not listen to us. They are taught to interrupt us when we- RANDOM MAN: Excuse me. Not ALL men. This received over 4,000 retweets (as of May 2014). ""Not all men"" became a meme around April-May 2014, eg: *  ""Not All Man"" comic by Matt Lubchansky (April 2014) *  Jezebel coverage of the meme *  ""Not All Man"" comic by Matt Lubchansky (April 2014) *  Jezebel coverage of the meme This Time magazine article (April 28, 2014) says the origins of the meme are ""shrouded in mystery"", noting that although the general idea was around before 2013, it didn't show up with that exact, meme-style phrasing.  For instance, the article claims that it doesn't appear in Bingo cards or derailing guides from the last few years.  However, it doesn't identify @sassycrass's tweet as the source. As of May 11th, 2014, this tweet by @cavalorn and others began to circulate, asking that people credit @sassycrass as the originator of the meme. Pop culture blog Vox, reporting on May 15th, identifies @sassycrass as the originator.

If you want to do something stealthily that will help your passing, start doing pushups and bodyweight upper body training. It's a good idea if you plan to get top surgery because the more your chest muscles are defined, the easier it is for them to do natural looking surgery.   Come out to your family when you are ready. If you expect that they will react badly (like, disowning you or hurting you physically), have a backup plan and only come out when it is safe to do so. Otherwise, while coming out can be an awkward time for your family, the only thing that improves that is time. So come out to them, let them freak out and not understand, and in a while they'll figure it out and everything will be ok.

It's about how you carry it when you're tall. Same with weight. And the great thing about being tall is, being slightly heavier is not only easier to hide because you're tall, it's also expected that you're going to be heavier than the average girl because you're bigger. So don't sweat the weight either. From what I see in the photo, you are by no means heavy anyway =] I am also 24. And when I have no make up on, I look about ten times more awful than you do in this photo - people have asked me tons of times when i've been without makeup ""Whats wrong?"" and ""Why do you look so upset and tired?!"" like i'm going through a break down or something.

In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead vocalist.  A frequent collaborator of Arjen Anthony Lucassen, she is a member of his progressive metal supergroup Star One, and sang in the Ayreon albums Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer and 01011001.

A green primer under your foundation will help to minimize the redness, defining your brows and getting them just a smidgen loser together will help too. Mascara will brighten your eyes so much and aside from that a light pink lip balm and you'll be good to go makeup wise.  I think your hair looks super cool but you're parting it on the side and it's kind of giving off a '00s me vibe.

transpassing,30b7kb,mtc6,8,Wed Mar 25 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Considering you're pre-everything you're in a great place to start off.   Right now I think you should move out brows closer together and start then above your tear ducts. The contouring is making your face more angled and less feminine, you already have super high cheekbones so the contour is overkill. I think a blush or a warm bronzer instead will soften your features. A lip color that is more pink and less flesh toned will also help.   In the first picture you are kind of over exaggerating your pose, which you don't need to as you have a very feminine body to begin with."
transpassing,30b7kb,vanguaaard,2,Thu Mar 26 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I have not been able to shape my eyebrows yet since I am not fully out yet.

You might want to pick up a brow pencil to just fill the front of them in that way you could just wash it off. And you should use a warm toned blush not cool that way it will soften your face, look for peach colors instead of cool pink. You're gonna have a supermodel face if you do HRT!"
transpassing,30b7kb,vanguaaard,2,Thu Mar 26 17:09:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I will have to try using a brow pencil. I was just borrowing some makeup and that was the only blush I had. I hope to have a supermodel face one day. I am going to see a therapist next week and am going to the letter for HRT as soon as possible. Do you think I would be passable or closer to being passable if I were to use some foundation, eyeliner, and eyeshadow in addition to the blush, mascara, and lipstick?"
transpassing,30b7kb,vanguaaard,2,Thu Mar 26 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"Some brands to look into are e.l.f. and nyx they are pretty cheap and great quality. You don't really need foundation, if you are careful with the eyeliner and keep it subtle, and a nice taupe/brown smokey eye you'll look great. If I saw you walking down the street I would not think man at all. In the third picture you pass 100%. With HRT your face will soften more and your chest will fill out which will help but the biggest game changer will be your hair, once you grow it you'll be in great shape. The wig and some of the poses are giveaways in the other pictures, which an easily be changed.  I actually can't really imagine you as a man, I'm here going 'what would you look like as a dude? how would those features work on a dude?' and I can't really picture it. My comments are more for improvement as a female because you already look like one."

A tip for your wig: take it to a hairdresser (or watch some YT tutorials) and thin out the bangs and overall thickness a little. Also you can use dry shampoo or baby powder to remove a bit of the shine if you want to.  Super thick, perfectly shiny hair is a dead giveaway for wigs ;)"

In this picture you have a bit of shadow on your face, using an orange primer will offset the grey/blue color of the hair growing and a heavy duty foundation like revlon color stay or dreamland will cover the color corrector properly.  However once the shadow issue is resolved you'll pass 110%.   Edit: I didn't realize I said concealer at first. Don't use concealer on that much of your face!"

transpassing,3077t5,Sarahjan,3,Wed Mar 25 09:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think you need to be careful not to over exaggerate your poses. I'm not entirely sure how to explain what I mean properly but the last two kind of seem too exaggerated. The way you're posing in the last picture you should put your hand on your hip or relax your hand and not stick your chest out so much. You have a great figure and don't need to exaggerate your curves because your feminine form is apparent if you're relaxed. You should do your poses with your butt facing the camera to make sure you're not flashing anyone when you arch your back, this is a major issue when you wear a skater skirt an have a booty. It will go up in the back and everyone can see your butt if you're dancing and not careful."

transpassing,3059uy,Cl0ne,2,Tue Mar 24 16:25:46 2015 UTC,I don't think you pass but I think it's more to do with styling than your actual features. Your makeup looks great but the harsh lines that your hair is creating on your face are making your jaw appear more prominent.   I think you should work on your brows a bit by shaping the edges closest to your nose. If you wore your hair like this it would soften your features. You might even want to have a bit of a side bang like this if you're worried about your forehead or face symmetry.
transpassing,3059uy,vanguaaard,2,Tue Mar 24 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"Haven't had a chance to get it cut at all yet but tried to do my hair a little differently today, I'm of the opinion that this makes my jaw line look more 'out there', and is very forehead heavy. But my my own identification of my image is notoriously bad, so ill post here. (the eyebrow difference isnt nearly as bad IRL, the hairs on the inside are very thin makes it look odd on a photo with my potatophone, need to deal with that......)  http://i.mrow.co.uk/20150330163013398.png  Yea ffs is defiantly on the cards for that jaw :("
transpassing,3059uy,vanguaaard,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:35:51 2015 UTC,That looks so much better! Your forehead and jaw aren't particularly large or anything I mean I wouldn't walk past you and go whoa even though they're slightly on the larger side of average. Once you grow your hair out and play around with softer styles you'll see your face soften up significantly. You're pretty close to this look if you want some inspiration.

You'll definitely want to blend out the edges of that more, doubly so if that's the only place you're wearing makeup.

transpassing,300a7n,ascii_heart,8,Mon Mar 23 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hope you don't mind a cisfemale commenting - a lot of your looks are similar to those I've played with when I was, shall we say, more lithe.  Black's your colour!  The last dress is a superb shape, but too small and short - don't be deceived just because the top fits and looks awesome (looks very athletic girl, tailoring creates an hourglass).  The waist is so much better than the others but hits just slightly too high (5cm? It's really close, just slightly jarring) and the skirt would look so much better if it came to just above the knee. ModCloth has some great examples.  I can see the attraction you have to the eyeball top. God I would have loved it when I was skinnier. I have a strong feeling that if you pair the eyeball top (or tops of a similar style) with a pair of dark trousers that are high waisted and have a wide, flat waistband and wide, straight legs (think Marlene Dietrich's signature style, tailored culottes, or sailor pants) it would bring your natural waist up and add to the hourglass."

transpassing,300a7n,cureyourills,2,Mon Mar 23 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's my personal taste as someone who loves clothing and is pretty involved with fashion. That shirt belongs in a 9 yearolds closet, not on a 24yo adult.  Especially not with that skirt.  Fashion is partialy about taste, but it's also about recognizing your age and body-shape. If I saw that outfit out in the wild, I would cringe."
transpassing,300a7n,whammygoat,2,Mon Mar 23 14:40:15 2015 UTC,I think you're cute and like how the black dress looks on you - the skirt part sits where your waist should be and the bigger bottom part makes your hips appear bigger in a good way. In the future aim for skirts that sit higher on you waist and are flouncy if possible. Maybe try either blunt or side bangs? I think side bangs might look good on you!

Think 'soft, rounded, feminine'.   Outfit 1: If you're trying to create the illusion of hips and a waist, the skirt should actually be where a waist belongs. Also, ruffles draw visual weight to a region devoid of actual breasts.  Outfit 2: You're 24, not 12. The top isn't age appropriate for anyone over 13, IMO. Neither is the length. Just, omfg, it beckons imagery of creepy middle aged crossdresser/sissy hell.  Look 3: No. No. No. The barrette screams 'pink fog'.  Look 4: Are you going to the renaissance festival?!?   Look 5: Why do you keep choosing items that draw visual weight to the fact that you have no tits and make your shoulders seem broader? Start stuffing your bra or something."

You're not aiming to look like you have makeup on, your goal is too look natural. If it's easy to distinguish the foundation from uncovered skin, it'll be obvious you have makeup on, but if there's too much it'll also be blatant. Remember that your goal is just to have nice skin, not to have makeup on."

I'm not sure if there is a mall around you that sells it but if there is you can schedule an appointment and they can show you how to put it on perfectly and they will match exactly to your skin tone. If not you can always buy online. Also it's amazing because it gives full coverage yet it's light and looks natural.

Thermal protector is super necessary to protect your hair!!  If you can afford it, I think it would be cool to get your hair dyed in a salon! The  color blonde isn't bad, and I can't really tell from the pic but it looks a bit generic? When i get my hair cut, I ask them to frame the bangs around my face. I can't tell how long the sides of your hair is, so I don't know how much that would apply to you.   For your makeup: it looks like you lined the lower lid. In most makeup looks, this is a ""no no"" because it closes up your eye and makes it look smaller!  It's also most typically done for a specific look (like bold smokey eye.) Instead, you can tight line (or regular line) the top lid to make your lash line look fuller! The next step would be to apply mascara. Applying to the bottom lid can be tricky. If you have watery eyes I wouldn't because it'll get smeary. Or opt for a waterproof mascara (which, imo can be a pain to take off.)   Your skin looks really great, I would love to see you with a bit of blush to put some color on your cheeks!

A 45 year old plumber in St. Louis won't dress the same as a 21 year old hairdresser in Miami Beach or a 32 year old ad exec in Paris or an 18 year old college student in East Lansing.   Your goal isn't just to look good. Your goal is to blend in with other men of similar age and lifestyle. Your goal is to look normal and look good.  PS. Smaller glasses. The ones you have kind of dwarf your face and make you look younger and/or more feminine."

Slightly more fitted clothes will also help. This is Kit Harrington, don't wear a Canadian tux like the pic, but that style of jeans and a button up will help you look more mature."

The fashion style of your clothes and your glasses looks like you're in a picture from the early 80's. Your hairstyle does not accentuate your natural features.

Women are also more likely to smile with teeth. Women generally have their eyes more open than men and their eyebrows raised. This needn't be dramatic.

Microexpressions and hemispheric facial cues are absolutely gendered within the human psyche.  Partially due to social programming, partially due to brain chemistry.  We pick up on these cues whether we realize it or not.  When an individual is attempting to ""pass"" in any sense (in this case, gender wise), it is wise to study these things in the group which you are attempting to conform to.  For example; Indians culturally wag their heads in conversation.  Telling a Western person to emulate this in order to fit in is not somehow racist.  If you have some sort of fundamental issue with this, take it up with western culture."

When I see pictures of myself I tend to think that I do - mostly jaw, chin, and cheeks. But, I tend to be more critical of myself. My parents, on the other hand, don't think I need FFS, but they tend to do the whole, ""you're perfect as you are,"" thing, so I can't take their opinion as totally unbiased. It would be awesome if I could get some unbiased opinions on whether I need FFS.  TLDR; look at this picture of me and tell me if you think I need FFS or not"

People have mentioned your chin and jaw, but you also have incredible cheek bones that really balance it out and read quite feminine to me, actually. I suppose your brow bone is a bit heavy, and if someone was really looking for it that could read masculine.  If you'd feel more comfortable with it, of course that's your choice - but I definitely wouldn't consider it a necessity. You're very pretty!"

No guarantees, but you might look like Rebecca Mader after some FFS.  Edit: Just saw your previous photos, you read much more feminine.

Your face has a mix of definitely female and definitely male features.  How are most people gendering you in your day to day life (ex do you get ""mam"" or ""sir"")?

I live in a very gay area and work in a very LGBT friendly area as well, so there's a decent chance that even if people were to clock me, they would use female pronouns out of respect. I think I probably pass on a casual basis, but if we were to talk or interact for any length of time, you'd probably clock me. Right on the edge is kinda where I feel I am too.

Your eyes are absolutely gorgeous, but I think that if I saw you in person, the masculine features would be more obvious. The makeup/hair paints a nice picture, but the features are still there. I think you're definitely doing great, but if you think FFS would help you feel better, then it might be worth considering."

On closer inspection, you are androgynous-- but so are many cis women. Your chin is broad. Not much you can do about that besides bone-shaving.  To be honest, though, you really remind me of a (cis) woman I know, physically. Some women have larger jaws than others. The 'first impact' impression is female. Maybe you might have some problems if you are very tall and have a distinctly wide shoulder-to-hip ratio, but I think most people would think 'damn, that's a tall women,' rather than thinking 'male' on first thought.  I'm being as rough as I want to. If I thought you read as male on first glance, I'd say so, but I really don't. I think in your case, so long as your voice is in line, you're totally fine.

Things you could do are grow your hair a bit more, wear larger earings at present you have small studs but if you had something a bit large it would leap out and say I'm a woman. The other thing that leaps out is a majority of women wear lipstick even if it is a colour that just makes the lips stand out.   Whilst your scarf is worn in a femine manner it is to close to the colour of your jacket many CIS women wear something the leaps out at you by being different to what they are wearning.

My fiancé: ""Hey what would you like for dinner today?""  Me: ""Dnno.. Whatdyouwannaeat?.."" Basically sounds like: Dn-no, whuh-duh-yuh-wah-nuh-eat?  But if I'm in a profession setting my words get stronger, clearer and concise to project my professionalism through speech. Deep voice, not whispery but also authoritive. Although, like I said before, it really depends on how you want to be perceived.   I'm unsure if that makes sense or is relevant at all for you, but pay attention how men around your age speak and try to mimic it. I can't speak like an average woman if my life depended on it.

transpassing,2zaj4i,Rhoda-Lott77,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:14:00 2015 UTC,"Laser your beard, get your eyebrows done, and dress better. This is possibly my own bias but it wouldn't hurt to lose like 20-25 lbs either. You don't look super overweight or anything (so please don't feel like I'm shaming you or something) but it seems like your face is kinda chubby which is hurting your chances to pass in my opinion.   You will get there, but right now I can't honestly say you are passing."

transpassing,2z490e,Canadian_Lagerr,11,Sun Mar 15 12:29:36 2015 UTC,"Good...  But you should work a bit on your silly.   I think you pass.  It's always hard to tell with photos, but if I saw you in class, at the pub, or just out and about, I probably wouldn't question your presentation based purely on this photo.  I know several women who look a lot like you.  Growing your hair out would help, but imo ""you pass"".  :)"

transpassing,2z490e,NeverSassy,5,Sun Mar 15 17:14:31 2015 UTC,You look really nice!  I think you'd look great with some earrings while your hair is growing out.  Some slightly darker lip stick or gloss would be flattering too.  I also think with your petite frame you'd look great in skirts with a little more volume in the hips.
transpassing,2z490e,pinkprinny,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:42:38 2015 UTC,Thanks those are great ideas.  I have been looking for some cute earrings...  I have some simple studs in right now.  I was actually wearing a fairly dark shade of lipstick that night...  But I think it was over due for refreshing when this photo was taken. I need to remember to do that.   I have been nervous about skirts for some reason...  But with warmer weather coming I figured that I would start looking.
transpassing,2z490e,pinkprinny,2,Mon Mar 16 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry; no. Which is totally fine given the amount of time you've been on HRT. I really hope you're younger than I'm pegging you for, as that will help too. In either case, congrats on the pills and hang in for the long ride.   Edit- your hair kinda looks like a wig to me as well, but I'm pretty sure that's just photo quality."

Spend the cash, its worth it. Underworks binders are the best, IMO. I have the Ultimate binder and the Tri-top. I much prefer the Tri-top, but if I want the little bit of hips I have flattened out too, I wear the Ultimate.  Don't buy cheap eBay/cosplay binders. Those thing are not made to be worn for any real length of time. Trust me, I bought a few.

I'm only about to throw it out because my lats and pecs have grown quite a bit, and I don't find the binder fits as well anymore from that.  I should include that I wear it all day, from when I wake until when I get ready to relax and go to bed. I also work a physically demanding job that I'm sure adds wear and tear to my binder.

If it is, I would say this is an improvement over your last post.   I see a lot of girls with the half buzzed, half pixie cut now. There are some guys who do it too, but they already have the whole testosterone thing going for them that still makes them look male.   I think you have potential to look like a passable boy. I don't think that you will pass as a late teenager, early adult without hormones at this stage.   Just so you know, some AFAB genderfluid people do use testosterone and then stop. I'm not sure too much about the process of going about that, though.   Your eyebrows are very thin. If you shape them, you might want to stop. You might be cursed with thin eyebrows like I am (even with T!), in that case, there isn't much you can do about it.  Anyways, keep it up, you're looking good!"

transpassing,2z2dsu,shysimone,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"No problem.  The biggest thing once you look somewhat masculine, is how you carry yourself and how you speak. Learn to talk more masculine (and its more than just a deeper voice)"
transpassing,2z0rdj,aria22,3,Sat Mar 14 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Hi aria,  I think you look lovely. Your skin is just... wow. It almost seems like you're already wearing makeup (not that I'm questioning your honesty, I believe you). You seem to look very feminine already, and that's without the estrogen. Imagine what you would look like in 12 months ;) (6months waiting + 6 months estrogen effect on your body). Honestly, I only see a girl in the picture, and nothing else. And I'm not just saying that to be nice.  Oh, and I love your PJ's btw. Good luck with everything."
transpassing,2z0rdj,hungryforchocolate,2,Sat Mar 14 14:53:21 2015 UTC,"You don't pass.  Yet. Which is quite obvious, but I think you have a good chance and that is what counts.  I like your nose and lips. I don't think you need full FFS to pass, but your jaw is what stands out the most (as you have noticed yourself) and getting it done would probably push you from pass to flawless pass without makeup in the future.  Good luck."
transpassing,2z0rdj,pass-inquisition,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I guess the FFS is something to really consider, then.. as is somehow saving money for it.. But maybe I can do without :) I don't like my underbite, but I can live with it, IF it doesn't get in the way of me passing.."
transpassing,2z0rdj,DaniPhye,1 point,Sun Mar 15 08:55:31 2015 UTC,Yea you're doing super good even before HRT. Also your skin is amazing what are you doing and can I have some
transpassing,2z0rdj,whammygoat,2,Sat Mar 14 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks ^^ haha, well I'm using moisturizer ^^ It was Nivea Sensitive DayCream, but i've switched to a different one from Nivea because makeup is starting to glide off my face easier (may be due to the T-blockers) >.<"
transpassing,2z0rdj,crystxlizes,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"I don't see any problems- you have an underbite but it doesn't make you look like a guy, just like a girl with an underbite. If this is you at the beginning, you have nothing to worry about."

transpassing,2yzbeb,Me-Power-Me,3,Sat Mar 14 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"From the pictures, you definitely pass.  If you have a high voice, I would read you as female, though.  If you're thinking about T, that would help a lot with voice.  Your hair looks cool and is already very short.  I don't think it needs a cut."
transpassing,2yzbeb,Lost_Downtown,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a very high voice, but it's not deep enough to be considered male. But I'm definitely looking forward to starting T.   Thanks."
transpassing,2yzbeb,FantasticToday,2,Sat Mar 14 05:01:36 2015 UTC,Hair looks fine! I have trouble imaging you as female so I think you are doing well!

transpassing,2yxk3b,xxNietzschexx,11,Fri Mar 13 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"Hairline sticks way out to me. Maybe full bangs are in order. Body seems to pass very well.  Your face doesn't pass to me in this picture. It might just be the angle and distance, but the overall shape is masculine with wide, square jaw and prominent forehead."
transpassing,2yxk3b,kineo,4,Fri Mar 13 18:03:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think her jawline is an issue, really, but the hairline is noticeable. Mine is similar, but I'm not ready to pass yet. She is way closer than I. Maybe a different hair style would help?"
transpassing,2yxk3b,whammygoat,5,Fri Mar 13 21:06:41 2015 UTC,I think the way that your shirt is streaching acrost your chest is not good- it just doesn't look like the shirt fits naturally.
transpassing,2yxk3b,petit_bleu,2,Fri Mar 13 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, got the shirt before the girls got bigger. Definitely overdue for a shopping spree."
transpassing,2yxk3b,whammygoat,4,Fri Mar 13 22:50:17 2015 UTC,Definitely get some bangs. That'll make your face seems much more heart-shaped.
transpassing,2yxk3b,Free_Blowjobs,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:03:52 2015 UTC,I get that A LOT.
transpassing,2yxk3b,nambyhamby,4,Fri Mar 13 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"You could color in your hairline a little, like there is probably a video of how to do that somewhere and I think it would make a big difference."
transpassing,2yxk3b,shysimone,2,Fri Mar 13 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"You should look into hairline advancement and a brow lift. Those are relatively cheap. Other than that, you don't have any other masculine features that really stick out to me, so that's super good."
transpassing,2yxk3b,shysimone,2,Fri Mar 13 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"Bangs, babylove."
transpassing,2yxk3b,BrandiMcC,2,Fri Mar 13 23:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think you're super cute, and I love your sense of style - you look very fashionable!  As others have mentioned (sorry I'm late), you have a very tall forehead, so bangs would help a lot to frame your face more femininely. :)"
transpassing,2yxk3b,BrandiMcC,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:19:03 2015 UTC,Bangs seem to be the consensus. Guess another cut is in order.
transpassing,2yxk3b,tarynflower,3,Sat Mar 14 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"It's up to you, but you could always wait until your next haircut when your hair has grown a bit longer to get the bangs cut in. :)    (at your current length, it's possible that shortening the front to add bangs could make your hairstyle look a bit more androgynous rather than femme)"
transpassing,2yxk3b,Nagemjoyce,3,Sat Mar 14 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"Realisticly, if your goals are to pass it's going to require surgery.  I like your hair color, your eyebrows seem a bit thin.  Shaping them is great, but you really want a natural thickness to them."
transpassing,2yxk3b,AppleSpicer,3,Sat Mar 14 04:18:49 2015 UTC,Specify the type of surgery if you don't mind.
transpassing,2yxk3b,JackBinimbul,8,Fri Mar 13 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"If anything, just a hairline advance and brow lift, which are relatively easy/inexpensive. How long have you been on hrt?"
transpassing,2yxk3b,skintagg,3,Fri Mar 13 18:28:39 2015 UTC,About 6-7 mo.
transpassing,2yxk3b,skintagg,4,Fri Mar 13 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"That's way too early to say definitively that you need FFS. The hairline advance would definitely help but you can also probably get away with bangs. Keep in mind people are just offering their opinions, so take that for what it's worth. You look great for 6-7 months to me."
transpassing,2yxk3b,CanadianLiv,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:11:00 2015 UTC,Those jeans have got to go! Super unflattering. I think you'd look better in skinny jeans. You do look feminine so rock it girl!
