picrequests,3e3li8,tragluk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:13 2015 UTC,I doubted that they're using a printing company.  When I worked at a printing company I would never turn away a client with a poor quality logo so that they could have it redone 'on the internet' for free.    I could be wrong.  They might have everything they needed from the original large-scale low-resolution png and the vector svg.  I know what I used to send for camera-ready files (which were always sent with my phone number) and I've never had someone need to call me.
picrequests,3e3li8,keithj5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"Since he's going to print the final product the ppi actually does matter, 92ppi is good for web/screen/digital but you really should have over 300 for photo-quality print."
picrequests,3e3li8,tragluk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:16 2015 UTC,Resolution without print size or a file's pixel dimensions is arbitrary and meaningless.
picrequests,3e3li8,keithj5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:28:39 2015 UTC,Then instead of sending him another 92ppi image wouldn't the correct thing to do be ask what the print size is?
picrequests,3e3li8,tragluk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"The ppi of a digital file has no impact at all on the file. It can be set to anything you want and changed at will. The PNG file I game him was 1600x1600px, so it'll print a little over 5x5 inches @ 300, which I figured would be plenty big to go on an envelope and, if I figured wrong, I also gave him an SVG file that can be printed at any size and any resolution he wants."
picrequests,3e3li8,keithj5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"The SVG is good, if he's using Internet Explorer to print his envelopes.  Most word processing programs don't support SVG format.

Minor clone stamp anywhere that no longer aligned (like the carpet) Then cropped to center everyone left. Voila!

Below is a photo touched up slightly, I fixed the shadows and highlights very simply.   Exact steps that I did  1. Image>Adjustments>Shadow/Highlights (adjust shadows accordingly, I set my radius to 70)  Then I needed to sharpen the image some.    Duplicate image the image then click on the duplicate layer and got to Filter>Other>Highpass (set to roughly 11).

One, I found the stuff in the background – the cords and blankets – distracting, so I went ahead and removed them.  Two, I did some touchup on his face. My goal wasn't to make him look like a different person, but to make him look like the best possible version of himself. If that's not the sort of touchup you wanted, my apologies. Just trying to give you some options.  http://i.imgur.com/B2yHAJ0.jpg - here is that version.  Then, I took it a small step further. With the flash, he looked a little washed out. I added a bit of color.  http://i.imgur.com/R39yAYT.jpg - here is that version.  aaaaand black-and-white.  http://i.imgur.com/LHjNe8V.jpg  I hope that helps. I'm sorry for your loss.

Typically you would use a scanner of some sort but I think you can do it photoshop? Otherwise I would have to get a copy of this printed to take in

I am sure there are professional graphics companies in the area you live. Google would be able to help you find some. The price will probably be really steep from them however. This isn't a bad place to look, or you can go somewhere like Fiverr.com and get it done extremely cheap, but the quality of work might be pretty horrible.  I would really like to do this if I had the time though. It looks like a really fun project that I have some ideas about, but i'm leaving town until the beginning of August.   If you don't have any luck finding a graphic artist or something that can help you out by the time I get back, shoot me a PM and I would be willing to work on this with you."
