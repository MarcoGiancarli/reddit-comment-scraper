Mike then needs to select a new vice president, and he picks Carol. He asks Congress for permission to appoint her and initially, the speaker of the house, Sal Astor, is skeptical of Carol's abilities but she wins Congress over with a song and dance number.   And that's not all.   Marcia is called promiscuous because she wrote about a fictional erotic encounter with Desi Arnaz Jr. in her diary."

I don't really remember what caught my interest but I'm actually on the last episode of my third run in about 2 years.  I agree with what I think is the general consensus, that the first half of the series is golden, while the rest ranges from pretty good to upsetting.   I'll probably watch the whole thing again soon.  I work with power tools and headphones on and because it's such a dialogue heavy show, I can enjoy it without having to watch everything that's going on.  Almost like an audio book.  The dip in quality seems to lessen with each rewatch though."

So last year when I had him, we watched it a lot. Got through the first season in class. By the fourth episode I started watching ahead on Netflix. As someone who loves politics, I loved it and have been hooked ever since. Kinda surprised I hadn't gotten into it before his class. I love the characters, love how they all care about the ""greater good""...it's great.  And as a side note, my government teacher is truly a fan...he's been teaching for years and shows it to all his classes every semester. And he will sit there at his desk and laughs at every little funny moment, even though he's seen all the episodes at least 40+ times (if not more). That's a dedicated fan."

Compromise seems completely impossible out here in the real world these days, even on issues where there is no divide.  An easy piece of low hanging fruit is net neutrality: there's no partisan divide among the electorate.  Every poll or study that wasn't financed by someone with an agenda demonstrates that regardless of political leanings, a majority of the public believes in strong neutrality protections.  Somehow though, the Washington echo chamber managed to make it so that it's an ""us vs them"" issue, with Democrats supporting it and Republicans opposing it for ""pro business"" reasons.  I could probably think of another half dozen issues like that.  Considering just how far we've strayed from the idealism The West Wing displays makes me sad, though."

Every time I watch it, I remember the Mr. Rodgers episode after 9/11. He came out of retirement to provide insight and comfort to people young and old who didn't fully understand everything that happened.  i see this as the more intellectual version of that."

He wanted it 3 years prior, he's a long-serving Secretary of State, and he brings the ""grey hair"" factor to the ticket. I don't think they mention Berryhill at all (maybe once or twice) after Russell gets tabbed for the VP."

thewestwing,3dgfi3,lonelyinbama,6,Thu Jul 16 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"I always liked seeing Andy, Toby and the kids so the fact it might have meant a better S7 storyline for Toby - involving him dealing with her campaigning and his taking on more time with the kids as a result - is definitely a a major factor in my suggesting it haha"
thewestwing,3dgfi3,TVPaulD,3,Thu Jul 16 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"I think Richard Schiff wanted to do the bare minimum in season 7 to fulfill his contract. I agree, the Andy VP story line would have been great!"
thewestwing,3dgfi3,tritonice,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"I think that was partly because he hated the Shuttle storyline, but either way he still could have done less episodes with the focus being on the campaign and needing to work less so he could look after the kids"

Honestly, Bingo Bob would have been a decent choice. He's clearly got some popular support, given the way the primaries went, and he's got a history in leadership--although not much.  What about Albie Duncan? (joke! Although the gray-hair factor is definitely there, plus an aura of bipartisanship which would help Santos)  A more realistic choice might be CA governor Gabe Tillman (he of the Stanford Club speech, in which the jokes worked). Gray hair, executive experience, and shrewd politically, from what we saw in season 6."

If not Leo, they would have needed to find someone like Leo, though perhaps, as you say, without some of his baggage. Bartlet was pretty popular by the end of his term, so having someone from the Bartlet administration would have been good. They would need to be a vet, as Santos had the military thing, but someone heavily involved in policy would have been smart. They might have tapped a governor from a progressive state, someone popular like a popular former governor of New York. Vennick drew on his leadership and governing experience from California, so that could have balanced things a bit. They could have gone with a former majority leader from the Senate, an establishment, centrist Democrat to win over undecideds who were warming to Vinnick's moderate positions.   I don't think any established character would really fit the bill."

Yes, from what we saw of him, he was less than moderate, but his scenes during The Stormy Present suggested to me that he'd be able to compromise and come to terms with differences of opinion.  He'd also bring in Red State appeal, as well as showing that partisanship wasn't something to fear in the Santos administration.  That being said, I realize he's a Republican and unlikely to switch parties.  We also accomplished the bipartisanship thing with Vinick as Secretary of State.

In fact, Vinick probably would've made more sense as a VP candidate anyway. He was far too moderate to appeal to the Republicans of the West Wing. Yes, McCain got the actual nod two years later, but he was running in a weaker field and followed a Republican administration that many considered a failure. It would seem like the GOP would choose a right-wing nominee with actual presidential experience and then he'd select his runner-up, the moderate who can bring them California."

At first, I was curious as to why Bartlet would let the Revere knife leave his family, considering he would surely have grandchildren soon (confirmed in later seasons).

Any kind of reboot would try to live up to the original, and more than likely miss the mark. However, I think a politics-oriented show within the same universe would be interesting. Maybe from the office of a representative in the house, or a senator, and see how they interact with their party leadership, with their committee, with the opposition, and with their staff. That would be a perfect place for Sam or maybe Will Bailey, plus it'd offer opportunities for cameos from other TWW alumni without making it necessary for most of them to be in the new series all the time."

The best spinnoff potential was when Sam ran for office. If he had won, a spinoff in the same world but focused on congressman Seaborn would have been quite interesting. Congress, even the Democratic members, were portrayed as antagonists in the West Wing, showing policy making from that side would have been nice.   Other spinnoff potentials include: CJ and Danny, Zoey and Charlie (yeah don't we wish), or even some of the DC bars that are pictured.

thewestwing,3d2dvn,diabolical-sun,2,Mon Jul 13 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"Young vs Seaborn in the primaries. Young capitulates and finds himself as Secretary of State to the LowSeaborn administration. The show follows him and his deputies through the nuances of diplomacy. Of course, Charlie is bit too young for this, so perhaps make him a chief deputy to someone more established (such as CJ Craig as Secretary of State)—he did want to continue working with her.  Bring back Ainsley as Chief White House Counsel...somewhere where she can be pitted against Lowe again!"
thewestwing,3d2dvn,Hilfandor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:41:20 2015 UTC,"Why would Charlie be too young? He was 21 when the show started and that was 18 months into the 1st term. So he was 27-28 when the show ended and (assuming they would pick up around the end of Santos' 2nd term) 35-36 now. That can't be much older than Sam season 1. Pretty young when it comes to running, but not too young to play a role in the administration."
thewestwing,3d2dvn,Vortieum,3,Mon Jul 13 05:09:40 2015 UTC,"35 is the constitutional minimum to become president. The youngest ever was Teddy Roosevelt, 42, and he was promoted from VP. youngest ever elected was Kennedy, at 43.  Elected to president at 35, especially with how much longer people live and the people that make politics a career, is going to be nearly impossible."

Anyway, that's just how elections (that follow America's election format) always work: the most viable general election candidates try as much as possible to avoid saying anything until they have to. Less viable candidates try to pull them to the party's flanks during the primaries (since that's their pressure point), but they have to run back to the middle to not lose independents and undecideds in the general.  Meanwhile, the plucky, unviable fringe candidates get to say whatever they want in the primary, since they aren't actually campaigning for a general election. They get heard, they get cabinet positions, they get book deals and talk shows; they even sometimes get vice presidencies, as a result.  Consider cycling: the General Classification contenders (the riders who could win the overall tour) try not to get caught up chasing stage wins against guys who are no overall threat. Meanwhile, the guys who aren't an overall threat can fight for stage wins because the GC riders can't afford to blow it all on one stage.  Of course, there are exceptions to this, but it's pretty standard game-theoretic stuff: which is why the show was written that way."

thewestwing,3cqy7k,DrakeGrayson,15,Fri Jul 10 01:46:00 2015 UTC,"I think ""wrong"" is too strong a word.  It's not like there's this big body of law or precedent that describes what happens when a President invokes the 25th Amendment.  Yes, there were three occasions IRL when a VP became Acting President.  All of these were for a few hours, and were planned and scheduled, and the Acting President did nothing much while holding the office.  I imagine that in each case, nobody even suggested that they receive full presidential honors since they'd be ridiculed.  Walken assumed the office with no notice, during a time of national and international crisis, and did serious Presidential work during that time including ordering troops into harm's way.  He also gave up his job as Speaker and Representative in order to do it.  Probably somebody introduced a bill to give him the status of a former President and there was bipartisan support for it.  Bartlet would certainly have been in favor of it."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,AbusingSarcasm,2,Fri Jul 10 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Bartlet even says he'd campaign for him if/when he chose to re-run for his old seat. Walken says Bartlet probably wouldn't be too popular in his district.  But yes. I don't think anyone could argue that Walken wasn't truly President, even if it was for only a couple of days. That ""IN CHARGE!"" headline pretty much ensured that he was in fact running the country during that period."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,mtrem225,9,Sun Jul 12 04:52:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Dick Cheney was ""acting president"" the entire 8 years.  (I don't know. It was probably ~for the drama~ on the show.)"
thewestwing,3cqy7k,scullys_heels,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC GW Bush had a colonoscopy (sorry for the image) at least once during his presidency, in which case he was under general anesthetic (ding ding ding ringing Season 2 bells here) and Cheney was acting President, but really only effective if something extremely urgent was happening and someone needed to be in charge."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,mtrem225,3,Sun Jul 12 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"On the occasions VP's became acting president, did they go through the process of being sworn in as Walken was?  Or were they just acting in the role of President?  I think Bartlet being removed from office and then being re-sworn in again after is the determining factor to provide your answer."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,Molladia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, whenever a VP becomes Acting President, he takes the presidential oath of office. Even its only for a few hours while the president is in surgery."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,mellophonius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"So the ""real"" president is removed from office and sworn again?"
thewestwing,3cqy7k,Molladia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. The idea is that he is ""incapacitated"" and unable to serve while under anesthesia. But because the acting president will only serve the duration of the president's ""incapacitation,"" you could consider the president not completely removed from office since it isn't permanent."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,mellophonius,2,Fri Jul 10 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think part of the difference was that Cheney went back to being VP after his ""term"" as Acting President. Walken had to resign from the House, and apparently didn't run for Congress again."
thewestwing,3cqy7k,evilgenius815,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:14 2015 UTC,Many former presidents have had surgery while in office. And also we have had technical president's like David Rice Atchison but none of them carry the honorarium. It probably does have to do with the length of the term would be my guess. And if I had to guess the time limit it would be more than a day.
thewestwing,3cqy7k,Gortonis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Real life Acting Presidents have never received this kind of honor, and while it may have been a conscious decision on the writers' part - as /u/AbusingSarcasm said, because of the differences with Walken's situation - I'm more inclined to believe it was an oversight. If it was intentional, then I can't imagine why they didn't have someone explain that during The Stormy Present (the episode with the presidential funeral). All it would take would be for someone like Josh or CJ to ask why Walken was getting the honors, and have Leo explain that Congress wanted to give them to him, or that Bartlet did. Instead it was presented as what was normal for an Acting President, when it wasn't."
thewestwing,3cpsjd,5secondmemory,10,Thu Jul 9 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is the low point of the series for me personally - not necessarily the storyline itself, but how the characters are portrayed. Leo (I believe in ""Let Bartlet be Bartlet"" back in Season 1) once said that if Bartlet wanted to do something more liberal than what would be expected of him, he would have said ""I serve at the pleasure of the President"". A cheesy line, but it underscores how Leo has his own opinions and tries to advice Bartlet as best he can, but once Bartlet makes a decision, Leo is prepared to carry out that decision. Bartlet sees an opportunity to make peace and Leo just tries to block him the whole way. It just isn't like him. Maybe after 6 years of being on that job the frustration with Bartlet's idealism finally hit a nerve, but to me it's just not great writing and not true to the characters they spend 5 seasons building up."
thewestwing,3cpsjd,mtrem225,8,Thu Jul 9 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"to me it's just not great writing and not true to the characters they spend 5 seasons building up.

thewestwing,3cpsjd,scullys_heels,6,Thu Jul 9 22:24:34 2015 UTC,Which is one of the saddest things in television history. I wonder how great the show could've been had Sorkin written all seven seasons.

It's not that the show is terrible, of course, it's just that surrounded by the quality of the Sorkin years, and season 7, the mediocrity of 5/6 is irradiated.

I know in other states they have a column for ""Republican"" and a column for ""Conservative"" (Sean Hannity tweeted his ballot once), but it ends up doing the same thing. What do these even do? I know a vote for a person is just a vote for the person regardless; is it just a vote of confidence that you're for statehood or you're a conservative rather than a republican?"
thewestwing,3cgu62,mtrem225,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:09:43 2015 UTC,"So in a lot of places there are a number of different parties, and candidates can be the nominee of multiple parties. What the guy did was vote for Bartlet in both the DC Statehood party column and the Democratic column, meaning that his ballot was spoiled and his vote didn't count. You have the role of the smaller parties exactly right--they're symbols. Candidates want to get the endorsements/nominations of lots of them, though, because the more your name is on the ballot the better. This allows conservatives, or people in favor of DC statehood, to get policy promises and move the conversation in their direction, even if they aren't big enough parties to ever actually elect anyone."
thewestwing,3cgu62,jonwilliamsl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"So if Bartlet was somehow able to get more Statehood votes than Democratic votes, it'd be sort of a mandate for him to push for DC statehood?"

thewestwing,3cgu62,maybebaked,10,Tue Jul 7 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"It's definately in DC. He goes right back to the White House after this happens. Josh worked in the Senate before the White House, so it would make sense that he votes in DC now too, being a permanent resident."
thewestwing,3cgu62,mtrem225,-3,Tue Jul 7 21:57:46 2015 UTC,"Because Josh is from Connecticut, and usually White House staff doesn't change their primary address (the President always goes back to his home state, and Donna talks about sending in an absentee ballot in this very episode). Connecticut to Washington is a very doable morning flight; you can fly home the night before, vote when polls open, and be at work before lunch."
thewestwing,3cgu62,Wicks-Cherrycoke,9,Tue Jul 7 20:29:34 2015 UTC,I think he's in Washington D.C. The other voter tells him he's in favour of D.C statehood.

thewestwing,3cgu62,flyingnomad,17,Tue Jul 7 23:12:55 2015 UTC,Deeeeeeeeeeeefinitely answering the dude.  Josh is too uptight to get jubilant before the actual numbers are in.
thewestwing,3cgu62,watchsnob,18,Tue Jul 7 23:21:24 2015 UTC,"He is absolutely yelling that you do have to be registered to vote.   This subplot (the prank, plus Donna) is all about the stress that they all feel on election day. All the work they've done, all the hours they've put in, and it's finally out of their hands: they have to sit and wait for the whole day to see what happens. All they can do is freak out about the worst case scenarios like Josh (What if all of our voters are like those idiots?) or rely on superstition like Toby (""Do you want to tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing?"")  FYI, you do have to be registered to vote in DC (and everywhere else in the US). Why do you think you don't have to?"
thewestwing,3cgu62,MisterWonka,3,Tue Jul 7 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"Actually you don't have to be registered to vote everywhere in the US - North Dakota does not have voter registration! (They instead use this precinct list system that I do not try to understand since I don't live in ND.) There are also a number of states that allow you to register on election day, so while you have to register you don't technically have to be pre-registered. Here's a fun state-by-state guide."
thewestwing,3cgu62,gonmendonca,2,Tue Jul 7 21:45:11 2015 UTC,That is an excellent point. I thought that you didn't because I googled it sometime in November or October and some sort of USA government site said that it wasn't required but I must just misread/misunderstood something.

Let's just hope that NBC and sorkin were paying attention when rob Lowe said he was interested in taking on the presidential role in an eighth season.

He was a great character, had such great lines and something else that was great - oh right, he was a geek!  What I found frustrating is that he simply was written out and AFAIK he wasn't even mentioned once, especially during the kidnapping of the Chloe."
thewestwing,3c2wsv,ForumMMX,3,Sat Jul 4 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"I never really understood how Sam being a DEPUTY and a speech writer would ever have made him the centerpiece of the show.   There were teases here and there about how Sam's words made the President be so much more effective (""we reach for the stars""), but it was always a footnote, never the MOST IMPORTANT bit of the story.  Obviously Rob had a different vision of the role than Aaron did, and having a Hall of Fame cast in almost every other role didn't help Rob be the point man. If Rob had been in Bradley's role, I think it would have been different. However, you never know."

thewestwing,3by733,jps815,3,Fri Jul 3 04:53:28 2015 UTC,"Ha! Fair point.   I always interpreted it as a juxtaposition of sorts, all going back to the ""desire"" expressed in the song: Santos looks longingly at Helen, Vinick finds comfort in recalling his wife, Josh and Donna (whether they want to admit it or not) still have a thing for one another, and Will, in his political operative lonesome, has his ice cream.   I have friends who have been campaign staffers. They endured much of what Will is going through at this stage in his life: a lot of late nights eating cold pizza in crappy hotel rooms, one nameless town after the next. Will has put his life on hold, in an effort to serve a higher purpose, and is driven by a strong sense of duty (even for a loser like Bingo Bob). So, in an environment where the obstacles are seemingly endless, even the smallest of wins are a big deal.   Hence, ice cream."

Just brilliantly done by showing the different perspectives of the campaign while tying the strands together by using this question of ethanol subsidies.  And ending with that great montage. It's easy to pretend that Sorkin ghost wrote that one.
thewestwing,3by733,logopolys_,2,Fri Jul 3 12:13:34 2015 UTC,"This is really the highlight of season 6.  The season started with a fairly weak Israel/Palestine storyline, then took time to find its feet with the Santos storyline.  Here, it's demonstrated that this is going to be a ride worth getting on.  The Donna, Josh, and Vinick parallels work amazingly.  Vinick becomes an increasingly complex character by becoming the only honest candidate.  And you can cut the sexual tension between Josh and Donna with a plastic butter knife.

thewestwing,3by733,Ganesha811,0,Fri Jul 3 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"The one thing that really bugs me about this episode is the subplot of Karli Farkula, the Turkish woman to be executed for adultery. Turkey doesn't even have capital punishment, for cripes sake, and prostitution (let alone adultery) is legal. It's just lazy writing to go ""Turkey is a Muslim country, viewers won't care if we make up stereotypes about them."" Other than that, great episode."

We just finished Two Cathedrals and I was blown away WAY more this time than the first time. So much that I missed that is really powerful, like how they kept including places (her desk mostly) where Mrs Landingham would be, but wasn't, in the camera shots, etc. etc. My wife doesn't get wowed by a lot, but I'm pretty sure she was knocked over a bit.  It's almost too bad that she knows there's seven seasons because it makes the President's decision easier to guess, but still...   Part of me wishes that I had seen the show when it first aired.  That one week to brood over and discuss and debate ever little detail would have been painfully delicious enough, but those months between seasons.  anyway, glad you stuck with it to get to those episodes.  hope you enjoy the next 110 episodes as much!"

Jed had already went back on their deal and decided to go for a second term, and because of that, he oversaw some actions as commander-in-chief that she believed had a very large role in the kidnapping (and at that point, possible death) of her youngest daughter.

thewestwing,3br7v4,johnnythornton,2,Wed Jul 1 15:18:53 2015 UTC,One of the main reasons we didn't interfere in Rwanda (which is what Kundu is based on) is because we had fucked up so badly in Somalia.

thewestwing,3bmp6z,britneymisspelled,6,Tue Jun 30 13:39:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting things I noted:   There are a few lines of dialogue and some action that gets cut because the actors were able to convey it with just their faces. I'm thinking specifically of Toby rushing out to throw up on the bushes. Richard Schiff was able to convey Toby's panicked state of mind well enough that they didn't need to go the melodramatic route. Earlier in that same scene, a line of dialogue and an action are flipped in the version they shot. As written, Toby says he'd like to stand up, then does; the way it's performed, he stands and then announced his attention to do so. It's another strong acting choice that conveys how rattled Toby is. In the script, Bartlet and Toby break the tension at the end of their talk by sharing a laugh. The filmed version wisely cuts that. This is an episode that doesn't want the tension broken."

thewestwing,3b7k0h,britneymisspelled,33,Fri Jun 26 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"About 14 years ago my dad and my stepmom and another couple went to visit my stepmom's college roommate in California. Let's call her Jenny, I have no idea what her name is. They were going to a conference in Vegas and made a little detour. Jenny worked for NBC (I guess?) and had access to a lot of show sets. They toured the place but there weren't a lot of shows being filmed that day. They saw The Drew Carey Show being filmed (they sat in the studio audience) and after visited the set for TWW, where I believe her friend worked the most.    No one was there, they had just wrapped up for the day, but they got to look at the set. Jenny got on her phone and about 10 minutes later Martin Sheen showed up. He had apparently been at the gates leaving, heard Jenny had visitors to the set and decided to come back to see them (I guess realizing they were excited to see the place and knowing no one was on set). My dad and stepmom are probably the two funniest people I know, as is the friend that was with them, but said they were complete idiots around him. Like, they never are at a loss of words and suddenly they were mute. He stayed and talked with them a while, despite their awkwardness. Asked if they wanted to have their picture taken, they kind of awkwardly didn't say anything. ""With me, I mean, your picture taken with me."" Again, not much of a response besides big smiles and nervous laughter. He said ""Well I've got some pictures here, how about I just sign them for you."" My stepmom said he was so much nicer than she could have expected - one of the kindest people she'd ever met. Afterward Jenny was like ""What the hell was that?? I was telling him earlier you were the funniest woman I knew and you all just stood there like idiots!""    The next day they came back and watched them tape. My stepmom couldn't remember a single thing about the episode (except for the fact that Rob Lowe was there). I knew my dad had the picture Martin Sheen signed for him, and that they both had scripts. He died in October so I've been slowly going through his shit and came across them last night. I was excited to realize it was the script for 17 People, and like yelled at my stepmom about how jealous I was and how great of an episode this was.    Jenny's dad died a year or so later and she was pretty strapped for cash. Martin Sheen paid for her and her boyfriend to fly home (originally her boyfriend wasn't going to go to save money) and paid for the entire funeral. She was at a loss for words she was so grateful, and his response was something like ""Well that's what we do, help each other in times of need. I can do this for you and I'm glad I can help."" So amazing. My dad always claimed they were best friends from that moment on, just to piss me off. Any time Sheen was on TV: ""Oh, my friend Marty is on! Mar-mar is great in this.""    I watched the episode last night (I'm currently rewatching and was actually only an episode away). There were some little changes (Toby didn't throw up, words here and there) which was interesting to see. The best part, though, is the description on the last page: Toby is staring at Bartlet. ""How the fuck can you make a joke about that?"" Bartlet's staring right back at Toby. ""Yeah, I made the fuckin' joke, you got a problem I can help you with?"""
thewestwing,3b7k0h,pghgamecock,2,Fri Jun 26 16:54:07 2015 UTC,Huh. That part about the f-bombs is interesting. I wonder why it got cut? I assume because of censors and whatnot. But how could that have gotten on NBC anyway? Perhaps they could have bleeped it.
thewestwing,3b7k0h,Polskyciewicz,4,Sat Jun 27 07:31:49 2015 UTC,Those were essentially stage directions. They were to illustrate the state of mind of the characters to the actors so that they got the intonations of the lines and the facial expressions.

He may have friends on the campaign that he would chat up a bit, especially once it got really interesting; kind of like how he asked Will about his dead candidate was doing in the exits.   As far as actually leaving the Dems for an independent that turned coat to ride a ticket, he would not actually work for it."

thewestwing,3b2pbs,billybadhands,5,Thu Jun 25 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"Well in terms of star power, John Hoynes had plenty of that. He was the presumptive nominee with a massive war chest (like Hillary). Obama back in 2008 was a complete unknown. A one-term senator he appealed across to not only democrats but independents and liberal republicans alike.   Bartlet has that.  His religious background would attract certain republicans to his cause, and his economic record as a Nobel prize winner is unimpeachable (heh) from fiscal conservatives.  So, would Bartlet beat Clinton? He beat Hoynes and Clinton has far more baggage than Hoynes did.  Would he beat Bush? Here his lack of military experience would do him good as Jeb gets smacked with his father and brother's war legacy.   Ultimately, Sorkin wrote Bartlet as a cross-party president, the best of the greatest US presidents from his JFK accent, his religious appeal and at the same time economic appeal plus people kinda do like having a nerd in the top office over a buffoon.  We're still in the mommy cycle of U.S. politics.  Bartlett was deliberately designed to be a President for all times, for all people.  Providing you accept that everything good was invented in New England!"

There's never another reference to there being seven on the republican side.   I think the Senate majority leader might have been in the mix early in the republican primary, but he was awfully happy to congratulate Vinick on he nomination.

thewestwing,3amf9f,chrismichaels3000,3,Mon Jun 22 18:52:55 2015 UTC,The toby storyline also makes me so mad he would never do that ever.

If he wanted his guidance he could have used him as a consular etc.   Also CJ as cheif of staff never felt naturally.

The ensemble was now broken. Now in season 5, with Sorkin gone, it's lost some pep. Though the kidnapping was a great plot with a great performance by John Goodman.   What I do is generally skip some of the scenes with Will Bailey (though not all). I'm also planning on skipping through much of the White House plot until Santos and Vinick start to become the show's main focus.   Generally, I just never bought: the disagreements between Leo and Bartlet, that the press secretary would ever become the chief-of-staff (though for TV plot reasons, I understand it), or that Toby would do what he did (Richard Schiff also publicly disputed Toby would ever do that). So, much of any of that will get fast-forwarded through as well."

The President and Ron say it's a drill to a) spare Charlie from feeling guilty, and b) prevent them from panicking about possible future attacks. Hence, ""On a need-to-know basis, who needs to know this much?"""
thewestwing,3agkg4,evilgenius815,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"What about the scientist that they had under surveillance though? How the hell could they track the guy down in like 45 minutes if it wasnt a drill? (I'm not referring to the episode length, I think they said it took them 45 minutes to clear everything up) Sorry, just playing devils advocate, the end of this episode is annoyingly vague, and if they did that on purpose...well, eff that."
thewestwing,3agkg4,evilgenius815,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's odd. What I thought the first time I saw it was that this was part of a string of attacks -- the ""false alarms"" they've been having that everyone spends the episode complaining about. But that scene -- and in fact the entire episode -- is written so poorly that it's tough to know what to make of it."
thewestwing,3agkg4,kd907,4,Sun Jun 21 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"I've always found the ending dialogue to be a bit weird. On the one hand, Butterfield says ""they didn't question it"" and mentions tularemia not getting through again. And Debbie gives a look when she sees the limo being decontaminated that suggests she realizes something is going on. But then Bartlet mentions to Butterfield about how he knew ""it"" was happening when he saw secret service agents or something and Butterfield says ""you didn't know it would be tonight"". That makes me think that particular incident was maybe a drill prompted by something having slipped through the screening system prior to that. I think that's what Bartlet was referring to when he made that comment about a need to know basis. They didn't want anyone to know about the contaminant slipping through so as to avoid panic and allow the agents to carry out the drill"
thewestwing,3agkg4,thunderer18,2,Sat Jun 20 04:59:03 2015 UTC,That's interesting. See I took it as what Bartlett meant my saying he knew when he saw the agents was that he knew something like this was going to happen eventually. And maybe he could tell it wasn't a drill by the faces of the agents.
thewestwing,3agkg4,teh_maxh,2,Sat Jun 20 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"And maybe he could tell it wasn't a drill by the faces of the agents.   If it was a drill, the agents wouldn't have known."

thewestwing,3agkg4,dtrainmcclain,3,Sat Jun 20 18:18:12 2015 UTC,Yeah it always confuses me as well. I'm going with drill and think Butterfield is talking about a previous time when their system failed.

Josh's character is Deputy CoS, but his role in the show is more of a Congressional Liason. Either way, this is a completely separate role as the Communication's Director, which is Toby.   As for the new CoS, Leo tells Bartlet to pick CJ. I think Leo knew that Josh would be leaving to run a campaign. Can't remember the reasoning for not picking Toby over CJ, but Bartlet can't really stand him for long periods of time. The show set up the CJ choice throughout Season 5, as CJ consistently speaks her mind about certain issues and challenges Bartlet sometimes, which is needed for the CoS role."

My impression of the Bartlet White House is that Leo is in charge, Josh is the point man on politics/strategy, Toby is the point man on politics/communication, and CJ and Sam are essentially under Toby. However, there's a lot of muddy middle overlap, especially as time goes on.   CJ's ascension to chief of staff exemplifies how her voice grew more important over time."

Go back and watch In the Shadow of Two Gunmen. When Abbey tells the anasthesiologist ""... Tell the press, don't tell the press: it's entirely up to you""  On the surface, we're supposed to see that as a habit formed of the 17 people: don't ever lie about it, but try not to bring it up. But what if Abbey was renegging the deal because the job got her husband shot? Like a ""to hell with the rest of the term! I want him out now!"" Kind of thing. Not a far fetched scenario when she's so emotional and probably not fully collected mentally.   If she gets the doctor to out the president, she can take her ball AND go home with a quasi clean conscience, at least if arguing with Jed about it later. I just have a hard time believing that Abbey would even think to preserve the MS secret if she was worried her husband's gunshot wound might be fatal. But on the other side, it could have just been a doctor covering her ass legally because of how many times they've had to dance around the question in the campaign. What do you think of that theory?"

She wasn't exactly pleased when Jed shoots for a second term, but it wasn't any kind of relationship-ending conflict. I can see that scenario happening if Jed started to have MS-related complications that early in his first term, like the paralysis later in the show.  I think Abbey just understood that the secret was eventually going to come out, and if she did anything that even remotely sounded like she was trying to orchestrate a cover-up, the entire administration would be up shit creek real quick.  That said, Abbey isn't great at making rational decisions in a crisis (none of us would be if we dealt with the situations she dealt with) so it isn't impossible."

thewestwing,39s33s,theotherone723,15,Wed Jun 17 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's definitely the case. Hoynes is a very savvy politician who is leaving a trail of bread crumbs to force the issue.   It's easy to fall into thinking Hoynes is a Machiavellian politician driven purely by ambition, especially when you compare him to ""let Bartlet be Bartlet"" era Jed. But it's hard to believe Jed would keep someone on the ticket just for purely electoral reasons - indeed, we get the whole ""because I might die"" moment that indicates Jed thinks he could be a decent president if called upon. Nor do I think would Josh and Leo rally round him when the scandal about his leaking breaks to that extent purely for the sake of the ticket.   You can also make the case that it would be a dereliction of duty not to be preparing a campaign to fill the vacuum of what he assumes will be a one term presidency.   In a show where so many of the politicians are idealised, Hoynes is arguably the closest to a ""real life"" politician who hedges and compromises.   TLDR: Hoynes: not all that bad really."
thewestwing,39s33s,theotherone723,5,Sun Jun 14 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"Hoynes isn't Frank Underwood. He wasn't trying to manipulate Bartlet into a scandal that would get him impeached/force him to resign and allow Hoynes to rise to the presidency. He was just doing what he thought was his right based on Jed & Abbey's ""one term"" deal. The timing was also right: he would need to start fundraising and campaigning about 1.5-2 years before the general election in order to have the potential for success. He was definitely reckless about it and went about starting to run in a way that could lead people (like Toby) to question why Bartlet wasn't running, but he didn't do it maliciously or with the purpose of intentionally ""outing"" Bartlet."

I'm using legal definitions of ""malice,"" ""recklessness,"" etc. (for no real reason other than that I am a law student and I'm used to using these definitions),  but there are certainly other acceptable views.  In the law, ""malice"" generally requires an intent to harm. It was never Hoynes's intent to harm Bartlet or ""out"" him. He certainly knew that it was possible and maybe even likely that people would be able to figure it out (and this is, in fact, exactly what happened with Toby), and he ignored that risk when he started to campaign, but he didn't start campaigning with the intent of harming Bartlet. That is the exact legal definition of ""recklessness"" (generally speaking): proceeding with a course of action in the face of a known risk of harm, even if the harm itself isn't actually intended.  So in that framework, Hoynes's actions were reckless, but not malicious."

I had always been interested (even at a very young age), but The West Wing helped keep me motivated during an otherwise demoralizing turn in my career.  I'd like to say that I'm really not as cynical about you when you say ""everyone is out for themselves"". It's not without some merit, but there are a lot of really good people in politics. I work at a consulting firm and I have the freedom to only work with clients I agree with on a policy level (it helps that the head of the firm and I have similar political ideology). I know a ton of legislatures who are extremely passionate about doing the right thing. There are bad apples, but there's a surprising amount of people who are truly decent.  One thing I have trouble explaining to my friends who don't work in the sector is the role of pragmatism in government.  I've been bashed for backing certain policy positions or certain clients. I do it because the alternative position is worse or because the proposed policy is a step in the right direction even if it's a weak half measure. I also understand that surrendering on one issue so that we can win a more important battle is sometimes the only way for something good to happen. Pragmatism is something that a lot of people don't seem to value anymore."

I'm satisfied with it for the time being until we can try again a few years down the road.  We live in a huge and demographically diverse country. We have to be able to set achievable goals where no one is completely happy, but all get a little something. That's how this is going to work.

thewestwing,398465,chrismichaels3000,31,Tue Jun 9 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"The Bartlet(t)s have been in North America since before the USA was its own country, and at the time of the writing of the Declaration of Independence, they were aristocratic enough to be part of Congress.   It's not unbelievable that they have a great deal of family wealth accumulated over the centuries. Remember, they were able to bequeath and then re-purchase their own family bible from the state of New Hampshire multiple times."
thewestwing,398465,Polskyciewicz,2,Tue Jun 9 23:15:04 2015 UTC,"I actually thought about the legacy of the Bartlet family in New Hampshire. But that doesn't mean that the money has flowed down to Jed. There is no evidence -- other than the fact that Jed himself is a Bartlet -- that his dad left him substantial family monies.  There was some discussion of the brothers of Jed's dad, and how successful (and smart) that they were, so I think that they were probably much more financially successful than dear old Dad. As such, there is no indication at all that the wealth that Bartlet has in the series came through his Dad."
thewestwing,398465,Celat,6,Tue Jun 9 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"It would more likely be Trusts, not wealth passed from person to person directly.  Over the centuries each family both withdrew a ""salary"", as well as paying into said Trust. It's not uncommon of large families.   If you read the history of the Whitney's you'll find that the direct surviving heirs today pull several million a year out of the Whitney/Vanderbilt Trust.   I think it was Todd Whitney who mentioned once he drew $8 million a year. What he didn't spend went back to the Trust. But his, and others, weren't depleting it. Their ""salary"" was interest on the invested value.  So the Bartlets could be in the same situation.  Ie: they're rich because they're rich.  As long as each family generation acts as Stewart's of the money, and not Owners, it can last forever.   And with their education provided, it's almost assured they'll get jobs as CEO's, etc, which afford them the opportunity to pay back into the Trust over time."

thewestwing,398465,Polskyciewicz,4,Tue Jun 9 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"I thought about that as well. When would Bartlet have been able to travel around giving speeches and get paid personal speaking fees?  As a sitting-president, he doesn't get paid for any individual speech. He was the NH governor immediately prior to becoming the president. While I don't know what the rules are for governors accepting money (to their own bank accounts) for speeches, I suspect that it is probably frowned upon and possibly illegal. He was a several term US congressman prior to being governor. I suspect accepting personal fees for speaking are similar.  Plus, prior to becoming president, Bartlet wasn't exactly high profile and probably would not have been a huge draw on the lecture circuit that would command much of a speaking fee.  Remember, Leo was not in active government service when he was commanding those fees on the lecture circuit, and he was a former Labor Department Secretary and former aerospace industry executive. His fees would have been substantially higher than then-Congressman/Governor Bartlet.  EDIT: Bartlett did have a Nobel Prize in Economics, didn't he? Though the money awarded from the Economics Prize is substantially less than what is given for the other prizes (and Bartlett had to split his Nobel prize money with someone else). He could have earned money giving speeches while a Nobel laureate professor at Dartmouth.... maybe. Though, he would have had to give A LOT of speeches to gain the level of wealth that he seems to have. I don't think Nobel laureates get nearly as much per speaking engagement as an ex-US Cabinet Secretary like Leo. As such, I don't think the Nobel is the answer to where Jed's money came from."

Remember, Bartlet's ""window"" for even doing paid lectures as a Nobel laureate was small (possibly non-existent) considering WHEN he was awarded the Nobel prize. He was likely already in politics when it was awarded... based on back-projecting Ellie's age and the story of Bartlet's conversation with the King of Sweden."
thewestwing,398465,BGA33,2,Wed Jun 10 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he made his fortune doing so, but if he finished school around 30 and began teaching soon after, I think a reasonable estimate is that he won the Nobel Prize 10-15 years before being elected President. He was not Governor of NH for most of that time, so it's plausible to presume he had many years on the lecture circuit and as a commentator in the media. I have no idea what figure someone of his stature could make for public speaking events, but even if he only made an appearance every month or so that would add up quickly.  But as to the original intent of your question, it's never explicitly stated how the Bartlet's gained their wealth, but if they were one of the first families to inhabit New Hampshire, I would figure their wealth is tied mostly to land and real estate. Most of the aristocracy during the 17th & 18th century were land-rich, not necessarily having big bank accounts since the banking systems we are familiar with were not invented yet."
thewestwing,398465,elkanor,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Bartlet was elected President in 1998   NH governor for 2 terms... 1995-1997 US congress for 3 terms... 1989-1995 NH state house for 2 terms... 1985-1989 won the Nobel prize around 1984 (Ellie age 8)... Calculated based on year 2000 when Ellie was probably 24 based on her being a 2nd year med student at the time.   So, Bartlet had maybe one year of speaking engagements as a Nobel laureate before politics would have interrupted that. It should be noted that Nobel laureates don't usually command huge speaking fees, as they usually speak to other academics and academic institutions. Despite being a Nobel laureate, Bartlet would not have been a household name in the mid-80s."
thewestwing,398465,Kaoswzrd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:04:27 2015 UTC,I've seen speculation before that Jed was not a sitting Governor when he ran for President in 1998.  That means he left office in January 1997 and while he was still Governor when he started his campaign (as evidenced by when Leo convinces him to run) he might have had some time to get some paid speeches in before he officially announced.  If he was a sitting Governor that goes out the window though.
thewestwing,398465,Kaoswzrd,3,Wed Jun 10 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"They do mention in the flashback when he wins the Illinois primary ""…former New Hampshire governor Jed Bartlet…"" IIRC"

Separately: My understanding is that his private school was on the level of Phillips Andover or something. The headmaster there would make good money (maybe not farm buying money, but damn good, college president level money ) I thought his dad's comment about being a student there because his dad worked there was a knock on his smarts, not their economic status."
thewestwing,398465,tguidry1976,8,Wed Jun 10 01:49:08 2015 UTC,He has a Nobel prize in economics and a PhD. Possibly he made it through wise personal investments prior to entering public service.   It's also possible that there was a sizable family estate that didn't pass down until after his father (and uncles?) died. Another option he was grandpa's favorite and he got left everything skipping over the rest of the family.

Inheritance from the family -- that skipped his asshole child-abusing father -- or something from a family trust. His father did not have money, that much was clear, even though he had the status of the Bartlet name. Investments were also likely in my reading of backstory and hints from the show.  But, is there any evidence from the show itself about this? I've watched the entire series a few times, and I cannot recall any."

thewestwing,398465,PotentiallySarcastic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think we are making some pretty large assumptions about what the value of the farm would be.  Reporter: I'm curious about the President's farm in Manchester. The property value increased $750,000. What's that due to?  C.J.: Secret Service improvements.  Reporter: Can you go into detail, please?  C.J.: The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the sun porch.  I did a quick zillow search for property values in Manchester and found an 85 acre plot for 1.5 million. http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/0000-Hill-Rd-And-Diamond-Hill-Rd-OFC-PATTEN-Candia-NH-03103/2102173671_zpid/  So the farm may have only been worth a more modest sum at the time. It could have easily been passed along through the family or purchased with his nobel prize money. The nobel prize is worth roughly 1.5 million in straight cash and even split it's still 750k. Also from this article it seems that the the earning potential of a nobel winner far exceeds the cash prize value. http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/02/169754.html  It is not unimaginable that he earned it in his life time. Even being asked to consult for companies with an econ nobel would surely have come with a hefty price tag."
thewestwing,398465,DoNotScratchYourEyes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"First, for many years (since its first awarding in 1969?), the economics nobel prize did not receive anywhere close to the amount of prize monies that the original nobel prizes did. IIRC, it was somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the monetary award as the other prizes because it was not covered under the original trust established by Nobel. Only recently has the economics prize money been increased to match those of the original prizes.  Second, Bartlet presumably got his prize in the late 70s (based on Ellie's back-projected age and Bartlet's story of his conversation with the King of Sweden). The prize monies were less then, which means the economics prize money was much, much less.  Lastly, Bartlet had to split his prize money with his co-winner from that year.  In other words, Bartlet's Nobel prize money while somewhat substantial, is nowhere clise enough to be the basis of his wealth so that decades later he would consider himself to have ""considerable personal worth"".  Also, I'm not sure where you are getting that the ""Manchester House"" is only 85 acres. In shots of the farm there were several dozen cows visible in various shots. Lets assune that Bartlet's gentleman farm has only 36 cows (unlikely, as it is probably more). There is a rule of thumb that 2 acres of open grassland are needed per cow. That is 72 acres. That doesn't count the acreage needed for the overhead equipment, pens, barns, etc...  PLUS, Abbey mentioned apple orchards. It is not likely that it is anything less than 10 acres... probably much more than that, even for a ""gentleman's farm"" like the Manchester House.  Not only that, there is some required acreage for the house, it's yards, the roads within the farm... and not to forget the acreage that was probably taken up by the ""secret service improvements"" mentioned on other episodes.  I think it is likely to be AT LEAST several hundred acres... though much more likely to be on the order of a few thousand acres. Remember that 1000 acres really isn't that big in farm country. It's only 1.5 square miles. I got the impression that the farm was quite a bit from town (based on Leo's comments to Bartlet), so it is likely that it is both a decent drive from the village, and large (adding to the distance to the actual house).   In other words, this has to be from some sort of family money or trust or something that was given him, that for whatever reason was not given to his father."
thewestwing,398465,TrappedUnderCats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"So I will take your point about the award value. If assuming he won only $300k in say 1973. The total value of that money by 2000 would have been anywhere from $933,000.00 to $2,160,000.00. I also had a quick look at median house value in new hampshire between 1970 and 2000 where it went from 63k to 133k so a little more than doubling but not keeping pace with the other rates of growth in the American economy. So the nobel money alone could have easily bought him a substantial plot of land alone.   He also had more time to sit on boards and give speeches than I think we are giving him credit for. He was a three term house member (6 years) and a two term governor (8 years). Also the 1970's is when executive compensation began to explode and grow. Granted Leo would have earned considerably more in the 80's and 90's from doing this it still would have been very lucrative. 8 years of being able to charge high speaking fees and sitting on a  few boards would have put him in the top 3% of Americans if my math is right.  I also think the farm is a bit of a confusing issue. There is a chance he allowed for sharecropping or a lease situation at some time. As it seems clear he was never interested in actual farming. Also the barn we see in the debate prep episode does not appear to be a large stable/feed barn, making me think that the farm when worked was likely a very small area.  From the evidence we have it is hard to judge on how he accumulated his wealth but it is possible it could have either been majority self made or majority family inherited. I can see the numbers going both ways"
thewestwing,398465,PotentiallySarcastic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"assuming he won only $300k in say 1973   It's probably nowhere close to that amount... the amount awarded was probably only around $200k in the early/mid-80s, which is when he probably won his Nobel. Plus, if you recall, Bartlet had to split his prize and prize money with his co-winner. After taxes, that's not a lot of money in the early/mid-80s.  I doubt he was leasing his farmland. Most likely he engaged a small staff to run the farm for him, allowing him to be a gentleman farmer and still a Dartmouth professor --> politician. Still, the land was still in the thousands of acres."

The Econ prize was not one of the original prizes and did not have the same funding source (Nobel's trust). As such, the monetary prize was only about 1/3 of the other prizes until very recently. Plus, his award was likely given to him in the early 80s or late 70s, when the prize monies for the ""original"" prizes were much less, making the Econ prize amount much, much less. Lastly, Bartlet had to split his prize money with his co-winner from that year.  So no, the amount of money he received from his nobel was almost certainly not enough to be the basis of his wealth."

It's a common kickback to administration families. They often rarely need it to send their child to that school.  Everything about Bartlet, besides going to Notre Dame, was that he was blue-blood, old-money, aristocratic New England American.  Considerable personal wealth also isn't necessarily how much you think. 10 million, something fairly obtainable by a Nobel prize-winning economist/governor/congressman/professor, is more than enough to be comfortably wealthy."
thewestwing,398465,mtrem225,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:57:43 2015 UTC,He was an economist but maybe there was a period he went into the private sector between the Noble Prize and Politics?

Judge Harrison was willing to go to such an establishment in the past, and while he now regrets the decision (tells Charlie he gave up his membership) it is noted that he was still willing to join in the first place.   I think it likely that all the waiters there were probably young black men who were generally treated poorly by rich white people, but it may have been deeper than that.   The purpose is showing that Harrison sees himself as above others, even showing that when Charlie even began to show any backbone, Harrison tried to get Charlie fired, (asked to speak to his supervisor) until he realized that Charlie worked directly for the President."

The President then responds more to the fact that they had a past and the Charlie mocked him than he responds to Harrison's protest. It's a fun thing involving Charlie and The President's relationship, as well as showing how little The President gave a fuck about anything Harrison said after he learned that he was having an affair.

In fact, let that be my first act of fatherhood-- drafting your release. Go back to my roots as we all must go. And now you're on offense and not defense. ANDY: I'm not going to be on offense or defense. TOBY: The things we do in our lives, many of them are not voluntary. ANDY: You don't say. I think you performed your first act of fatherhood already. TOBY: Yes, indeed. So let my second act be throwing you a little press conference.""  source Of course when they hook up, due to their past experience with IVF they assume they don't need the goalie, and so they go without and get pregnant, which to me certainly doesn't seem like it was the plan.

Once those Sorkin-isms became so widely discussed in the past few years, it led to some reexamination of his earlier work, like Sports Night and The West Wing, where some of those same habits were present (though in far less pervasive and problematic quantities, and were often covered for by far superior writing)."

thewestwing,38gqow,Hilfandor,11,Thu Jun 4 06:22:48 2015 UTC,I think he is GOING to be the smartest person. Comparing Bartlet and Leo to Sam is just unfair. Wisdom plays a big part in it and Sam doesn't have the experience yet. I believe once Sam is the ago of Bartlet he will be smarter than he is and also be President.

thewestwing,38gqow,whipped_honey,14,Thu Jun 4 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"Josh.   He hides this well and never tries to show it off, but he is extremely smart. You remember the episode where Sam does Josh's job for one day? How he tells Mallory: ""I love Josh like a brother; and he is a world-class political mind, but until today I didn't he realize was smarter than I was.""  You notice how everyone gets incredibly mad at him when he screws up? It's because people don't expect it from him. Everybody else gets forgiven for similar or worse mistakes, but Josh lands in the penalty box for weeks or months. It is needed by the writers to offset his genius."
thewestwing,38gqow,ManWithABeard,3,Thu Jun 4 08:56:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. Josh is running close to Leo's level of political deftness and knowledge from the get go. It's pretty clear most of his day to day stuff is not that difficult for him to handle. He singlehandedly appears to run Bartlet's legislative agenda while also staffing the President. About the only thing he seems behind Leo on is foreign policy but even then he shows he knows whats going on at a level consistent with Leo and Bartlett.
thewestwing,38gqow,PotentiallySarcastic,3,Thu Jun 4 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"Agree with the answer, disagree that he ""hides it."" Unless you count saying ""thing"" a lot instead of utilizing his self-described ""760 SAT vocabulary."" He doesn't show off per se, but his intelligence is obvious just based on his job and also what he's already accomplished.  You mentioned the time Sam said Josh was smarter than he was. Also note Bartlet's quote to Leo during The Stackhouse Filibuster: ""Leo, you have a deputy, who quite frankly is smarter than you are. Whatever it is, let him handle it."" Leo didn't disagree.  He's also a Fulbright Scholar (multiple mentions), has a very high IQ (20 Hours in America), and was poached by Leo for the Bartlet campaign ""to let people know they were serious."" It's obvious he's a political genius, but he's also just super intelligent. Of course, every one of the Bartleteers is super intelligent... but aside from Jed himself, I think Josh takes it."

thewestwing,38gqow,i_pwn_reddit,3,Thu Jun 4 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"Smart in terms of what? Because there's political smarts (savvy), there's IQ, there's book smarts (well-educated, well-read, etc.), there's wisdom...  A lot of people will say Jed, because he's a PhD in economics and a Nobel Laureate, not to mention POTUS. He's politically savvy (acknowledged by Vinick among others) and he's wise. But Jed thinks of Leo as smarter, although he never elaborates. Wiser? Better at politics? It's probably safe to assume he doesn't think Leo's a better economist from a theoretical perspective.  C.J., Josh, Sam, and Toby are all well-educated and well-read, which we know from their respective educations and demonstrated abilities. By the end, both C.J. and Josh were serving or about to serve as Chief of Staff, which indicates some level of wisdom, experience, political savvy. But they aren't as experienced as Jed or Leo by the time they leave us.  Even Donna and Charlie are smart people. Sam was impressed with Charlie's ability to essentially start college as a junior. Donna didn't finish college, so she's not as well-educated, though she did benefit from her short stint at U. Wisconsin, since she could understand the misuse of Robert Frost. She spends the majority of the series holding herself back not only because of her feelings for Josh, but also because she seems to doubt her own abilities (remember that she was offered Issues Director at Capitol Scoop, Will told her that her resume was an undersell, and Helen wanted to stake her claim for FLOTUS chief of staff before Matt could make an offer). Her constant questioning Josh on policies and political moves demonstrates an intellectual curiosity, not to mention she did make a few good points (and acted in place of the audience). No one's going to argue that Donna's got an IQ or education that could compete with Jed, but I think it's pretty silly that people here are pointing out her naivety as an indication that she's not smart."
thewestwing,38gqow,asciident,3,Thu Jun 4 10:35:41 2015 UTC,"Decent question.  Obvious answer is President Bartlet. Behind him I'd say Josh, but if you say that you then have to consider the darkhorse - Amy Gardner. We know she did better in Law School than Josh did despite Josh admitting he was a workaholic at Harvard. I think the argument can be made that Amy Gardner's mind is brilliant but she lacks the composure to channel her intelligence and make wise political moves. Essentially, her ""Constituency of One"" negates her intelligence. She knows what the ""correct"" move is, but she doesn't care."

Also, when Bartlett was giving advice to the Designated Cabinet member that was chosen NOT to attend the SOTU address ( it may have been the Secretary Of Agriculture not sure though) he mentioned if you have a best friend & he's smarter than you, that's your Chief Of Staff.

I noticed that on one of my early rewatches and have looked for an explanation on each subsequent rewatch, but have failed to find an explanation. It's a bit odd considering CJ's character. There are multiple mentions throughout the series of her being at least active if not athletic (literally the first shot of her in the premiere is on a treadmill). Couple that with her height and it's not unreasonable to think that she has played at least a little basketball in her youth."

thewestwing,382urr,cassosonofrhllor,4,Mon Jun 1 13:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think, and I'm not entirely sure, so don't quote me on this, the reason the court would not strike it down is because it would be grant money to study a medical treatment. The senator wants the money not to directly fund praying, but to fund a medical study into the efficacy of intercessory prayer. The first amendment specifically blocks the government from forcing people to follow a set religion, and doesn't allow them to do things like withhold money from organizations that don't have morning prayers before work, for instance, but that doesn't mean the government doesn't have the right to fund a program allowing for the use of prayer. As long as no one is being forced into the program, or being forced to pray, it doesn't violate the 1st amendment. Since this would be, I'm assuming, a voluntary study, it's not a violation of church and state."
thewestwing,382urr,Wolfish_Jew,5,Mon Jun 1 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"So the reason that the staff object is though it's not actually a violation, it feels like it's wrongfully approaching one anyway? PS - Thanks for the helpful answer."

thewestwing,382urr,Willravel,3,Mon Jun 1 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"Things are simple from a Constitutional perspective, but not a political one. While in theory the courts are apolitical, the reality is that judges are not, and biases can and often do find their way into rulings.   To give you an example, the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution includes something commonly referred to as the Equal Protection Clause (emphasis mine):   All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.   The concept is a brilliant one from the political theory and civil rights perspective, that no matter who you are, the law will treat you as it would treat anyone else, regardless of race, gender, orientation, etc. The law is to be equally applied to everyone. So, you might wonder, how are there laws in the United States explicitly disallowing gay marriage? Wouldn't that be a law which singles out a subgroup of Americans? Judicial decisions which are biased in favor of certain judges' political and religious beliefs are responsible for this, and are taking a lot of time and effort to reverse with the help of responsible judges.   School prayer is a contentious issue between those who want the government secular and those who want it religious, so it depends on who the eventual first amendment case would appear before."

thewestwing,37rgmj,Ramady,4,Wed Jun 3 18:09:20 2015 UTC,McCain today is more conservative. McCain circa 1999-2000 when he lost the nomination to W was more moderate. That was the McCain that Vinick is modelled after. Because Vinick came around in 2005-2006 before McCain's hard right turn to win the nomination in 2008.

His line ""What plaid flannel-wearing, cheese eating, yahoo of a milkman governor signed that idiot bill into state law? It was me, wasn't it?"" always makes me laugh."

thewestwing,37gmf6,PardonEricAndTroy,3,Thu May 28 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"The reasons? They work for the President, and his agenda is all that matters. The characters can be as opinionated they want behind closed doors, and can respectfully present their emotions on an issue to the President, but in public, they need to show the President's views, and not their own. And it needs to be presented in a professional, controlled manner.   If CJ, Toby, or Josh publicly made their differing views on a significant issue known, they'd likely be asked to resign."
thewestwing,37gmf6,mtrem225,6,Wed May 27 14:51:33 2015 UTC,you answered your own question.  They had to remain professional.  it's pretty normal to have to do this.
thewestwing,37gmf6,Dream_Out_Loud,4,Wed May 27 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"I actually thought Toby was the most emotional person in west wing. I felt like everyone else was well balanced and when they needed to show emotions it seemed very justified.  for example:  Spoiler SpoilerSpoilerSpoiler just to name some issues the main characters had to deal with.  But when it comes to Toby,  his ex-wife says hes just sad and i think he really is. After she mentioned this i totally looked at Toby differently. He is struggling so much with his pain from so many different things that it just invades his character making any moment of joy an explosion and any thing that made him angry also caused him to have a fit. For example his night of jubaliee he could be happy before the vote was done even though he new it was locked up. He had to instill some sort of fear so as not to jinx it. He explodes at the president on a few occasions and he calls Bartlett out on his shit too. Toby is a powder keg and enjoys being at the end of a good lashing. Maybe he's a scared and sad guy. Just my thoughts."
thewestwing,37gmf6,Tony_Haten,3,Wed May 27 20:00:35 2015 UTC,He had to instill some sort of fear so as not to jinx it.    Very well said.
thewestwing,37gmf6,erier2003,0,Thu May 28 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"It's interesting you should say this, because I always thought CJ's emotions came to the fore a lot more than most of the other characters (in re Women of Qumar especially, but I think it pretty much popped up here and there periodically). There was plenty of talk about her having to bury them, but it was never something that was talked about so much with the other characters. Always made me uncomfortable, I see it as part of Sorkin's weakness in writing women - which, God knows I love this show, but which I think is really not one of his strong points."

The first image is the letter as Santos reads it, the second two are when Bartlet was writing it.  The two letters are not the same as the one Santos opens is missing a line and never completely visible on screen.  It's hard to make out, but the site http://www.tv.com/shows/the-west-wing/trivia/ says it reads:   ""To President Santos,  Congratulations to you and your family. May your wisdom and experience guide you through the next four years.  Remember we can't always do great things but we can do the things with great luck!  Josiah""  Interestingly, in the scene where Santos opens the letter, the last line is missing and it's signed Best Wishes, Jed Bartlet, which he did not have time to write when he was finishing it with Debbie. His pen strokes match that of Josiah. They must have filmed Matt's scene before Jed's and he added to the letter covering up the existing signature. Ironically the missing line would have made Matt smile."

Even then there are a few instances where he's involved in military briefings (when a Carrier Battle Group is moved into position to bomb Syria and when there is a coup in Kondu. In real life there are sometimes multiple deputies with varying portfolios of daily responsibility.   Staff responsibility varies a lot Administration to Administration. Barlett leaned heavily on Leo for military advise but then on Kate when CJ became Chief of Staff. Under Santos I imagine that Vinick was leaned on heavily for the strategic advise while using his own military experience for tactical requirements.

thewestwing,36wse3,PardonEricAndTroy,5,Fri May 22 20:11:17 2015 UTC,'I didn't know that.  It's interesting that such an important plot point would come about because Sorkin wanted to do one little comedic scene.

He's probably the strongest idealist on the staff, someone who probably never should have gotten as far as he did, but a surprise dark horse finally allowed him to be in a position where he could do good things.  He accomplished a lot, but you can tell that every time the issues are overlooked or he loses a fight, something very substantial gets torn away from him. Sam was a strong idealist who learned to work in the system, but Toby never got used to it, and I don't think the reality of the administration was anything like he wanted it to be."

He says something along the lines of ""My father didn't just hook up with a cocktail waitress, he had a woman in a house in Santa Monica for 20 years"". I'm paraphrasing.  One of the best episodes for me, and the title song (Don Henley - New York Minute) is pretty outstanding too."

Originally, Vinick was supposed to win, but the real-life death of John Spensor and on-screen death of Leo made a Santos (Josh) loss too sad.   If you're looking for in-universe answers, you're asking the wrong questions. Why not Walken?  He was the actual president during a crisis, and he is only even mentioned once in the primaries."

At the time of Mr. Spencer's death, the plot for last night's episode had been set: the election was to be won by Alan Alda's Arnold Vinick, a maverick Republican (modeled a bit on Senator John McCain), whom many Democrats (including the Democrats who write the show) could learn to love.   source"

thewestwing,36c03b,morrispated2,2,Mon Jun 1 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"Vinick didn't run because political party's never put up their best horse against an incumbent. When you're running against an incumbent you always put up your second best guy because the likelihood of winning is very low and once a person has lost a presidential election their record is forever tarnished and that becomes an issue that would need to be addressed in future campaigns inherently hindering their ability to win. We're republicans genuinely excited about mitt Romney in 2012? No, Jeb bush was their man but instead of running against a sitting president they held him back until 2016 when the field would be wide open. Now look where we are, Jeb is the heavy favorite to win the nomination and widely considered the only republican that has a chance against Clinton. We're the democrats really that into Mondale in 1984? Of course they weren't but they ran him because they had to put somebody up against Reagan but he was so powerful that it was almost like a sacrificial lamb. I enjoyed the fact that it never really seemed like Ritchie stood a chance, kinda gave the show a sense of realism."
thewestwing,36c03b,mtrem225,6,Mon May 18 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"Republicans are much more forgiving than Democrats in this respect though. Dems almost never re-nominate a failed past nominee, whereas Republicans tend to follow the ""who's next in line?"" mentality. For example, Republicans didn't abandon Nixon when he lost in 1960, or Reagan when he missed the Republican nomination in 1968, or McCain when he lost the nomination in 2000, or Romney when he lost the nomination in 2008. Democrats aren't quite so forgiving, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton now. Was anyone even talking about the possibility of Gore running in 2004 or Kerry running in 2008?"
thewestwing,36c03b,EinsteinDisguised,1 point,Mon May 18 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like the only one of those that applies in this case is Nixon. Reagan, McCain and Romney lost in the primaries, not in the general. There was a little bit of chatter about Romney running again in 2016 but everyone was like, ""Lol no.""  I mean, it's not like you can't run again after losing a general; if you win enough primaries, you're the dude. But I can't really see a modern political party throwing its weight behind a candidate who already lost a general."
thewestwing,367f6u,UBaThrowaway,5,Sat May 16 22:04:14 2015 UTC,It's about social security. It's the beginning of Toby's plotline in the next episode where he takes Senator Gillette to lunch and gets yelled at for a bit.

I've got the show on DVD, but I find that if I'm in the mood for The West Wing, it's a few clicks away. A lot of people are discovering and rediscovering it, and it's sitting at 5/5 stars currently. I've even heard that interest in The West Wing even played a factor in Netflix making House of Cards.   It's been a lot of fun to have new fans come on board to discuss episodes they just saw for the first time, to talk about Abdul Sherif or the kidnapping or LemonLyman.com. We get to vicariously experience the show again and we get new discussions."

thewestwing,35zmmb,smokeymcdank,19,Thu May 14 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely the story-line itself.  CJ told Toby and he pawned it off on his brother when he said his brother wanted to ""lorde it over him"". In the end, he was just protecting CJ."
thewestwing,35zmmb,stanleyipkiss,4,Thu May 14 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"The confusing part however, is that when Babish is questioning CJ, he glosses right over the conversation.   He confirms with her that the conversation took place but does not make the connection that perhaps Toby knew nothing about it prior to the season 6 meeting referenced above."
thewestwing,35zmmb,cateml,2,Fri May 15 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"I think maybe, but maybe his brother mentioned it as well. It seems like a big leap to leak something CJ maybe slightly alluded to. He must have had more information than that? Even if it was just that BOTH she and his brother had hinted?  And I think as far as ""protecting CJ"" I think he had probably thought all of that through before he leaked it. It would have been out of character for him not to. He'd probably already thought about what to do if he was caught (always a good possibility of that) where he'd say he got the information from before he said anything to Greg Brock.  Basically the other option is that he didn't think about the fact that CJ could well get in deep shit for something that he knowingly did. He was protecting her, but really only from his own actions.   I know its not strictly what is being talked about here, but I've always thought the ""It wasn't Toby, it was CJ who leaked it and then he covered for her"" theory was pretty crazy. I'm not saying I like the storyline, but if any of the staff members were going to leak information like that, it would have been Toby. CJ almost said a bit too much to reporters a few times when she was angry, but definitely never seemed to be encroaching on 'leaking secret military operations to the press'. Toby on the other hand was notoriously principled to a fault and had strong self destructive tendencies.   To be honest, this is sort of my main issue with the storyline and it being out of character. Its not that Toby wouldn't leak the information in the first place (because he seems to be the only character who would), its that he wouldn't figure out that of course CJ would be suspect number 1 and that eventually she would go down unless he owned up to it. He was supposed to be more canny than that."

thewestwing,35zmmb,charliemike,1 point,Fri May 15 15:35:11 2015 UTC,Perhaps. But her outrage was either a bad red herring or sufficient motivation for her to leak it. She all but leaked it on camera (not off screen) when she was being talked off the ledge.

Somehow, Toby's brother alluded to it at one point. Never explicitly. Something like referring to a military space program in whatever few conversations they had (like ""the USAF has that technology""). When CJ mentioned it, Toby put 2 and 2 together and figured it must exist (CJ asking) and enough technical details to make it register by the NSA (something his brother said)."

I can't imagine anyone missing her after she disappeared. After that, I never really cared for Doug in S3, but he's useful in that I loved watching Toby get all wound up around him.  After season 4: everyone. Since they act like other people."

thewestwing,35xf2k,tjp-,1 point,Sat May 16 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"The show started out too communications heavy. You have Toby and Sam who run communications and CJ who is Press Secretary. Add Mandy as a media specialist or whatever she was and you've got most of the cast just focusing on image, wording and that side of politics. I don't know I just always found it odd that most of the people a president would have advising him would be more focused on image and wording and how to sell things than actually crafting policy in the first place."
thewestwing,35xf2k,maxpenny42,17,Wed May 27 02:58:39 2015 UTC,Will Bailey. I'm completely surprised to see no one else is squeamish when it comes to our Mr. Bailey.
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,11,Thu May 14 15:30:51 2015 UTC,I liked him in Season 4.
thewestwing,35xf2k,PardonEricAndTroy,8,Thu May 14 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, must have been right at the very beginning of his arc. He was ok but uninspiring, to me, even then. During the show's first run I chalked it up to a new character, but over the years upon numerous rewatches, I've just decided he is a creepy character and I can't get behind him and especially not his romance with Kate."
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,2,Thu May 14 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"YES!  Creepy!  I'm not even sure why, but he comes across as creepy!"
thewestwing,35xf2k,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,2,Thu May 14 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. But any character that Sorkin created got screwed up by the writers after he left. It's basically an alternate universe that I ignore."
thewestwing,35xf2k,PardonEricAndTroy,1 point,Thu May 14 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's one way to go. I myself just go with what came on the screen, so Will just was never my favorite character. I always thought he thought he was just too cool for the rest of them."
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,3,Thu May 14 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"It's like this: if 4 seasons-worth of creative force, tone, and characterization is all the writing of one person, and the person leaves, and then it becomes obvious that the new writers/showrunners care little about what was previously established... I'm out of there. Especially when said previous years were some of the best TV in history. I understand yours and others' desire to see a series out to the end, but in terms of talking about favorite/least fav characters, I can't acknowledge the characterization of established characters after he left, because they were all body-swapped with alien versions of themselves.  Of course, Will didn't have much time to be developed in season 4, but he was established as a pretty good guy. Oh well."
thewestwing,35xf2k,PardonEricAndTroy,1 point,Thu May 14 16:49:27 2015 UTC,I can go along with you most of the way but when The West Wing was originally on it was the only thing keeping me sane during Bush the younger years and I was not about to be out of there. So as to us seeking it out to the end it was more of watching out of desperation more than anything else.
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,3,Thu May 14 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"I understand. I watched on original airing, and I too needed sanity in the 2000s. But I felt like Sorkin leaving and NBC essentially dumbing down the show to more of a typical John Wells drama was going right along with the dumbing down of America that the GWB years brought. So it made me loathe the show, and I wore out my tapes (lol, tapes) and DVDs re-watching seasons 1-4."
thewestwing,35xf2k,PardonEricAndTroy,2,Thu May 14 17:10:11 2015 UTC,"All I can say is I was raised and still living inside of the beltway at the time of the original airing of TWW. My parents both worked for senators and grandparents worked in DC for various gov't agencies. I really did get thru the GWB years with TWW as my only alternative. If they gave me Will Bailey so be it, but I didn't have to like him. I really did enjoy way the series finally did wind up so I can't be too mad at the team who took over after the original team left."
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,1 point,Thu May 14 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"That's a common misconception, that the writers after Sorkin didn't care about what he had set up. Really, they didn't know how to write like he did, because he never told anyone what his thought processes were.  I vaguely recal that another member of the production team (Schlamme or Wells, maybe?) saying that Sorkin's process was ""lying on the couch until an idea hits, then he furiously scribbles for an hour or so and says 'here's the rough draft'""."
thewestwing,35xf2k,TonySPhillips,4,Thu May 14 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"So he gets his ideas at the last minute? That has nothing to do with how people are characterized. Whether you plan an arc three months in advance, or you finish writing it in the car (hi, Sam), you still owe it to established characters to make them act like themselves. You owe it to established characters to consider continuity, their histories, their previous ideologies, and write them as true to character as they deserve."
thewestwing,35xf2k,PardonEricAndTroy,3,Thu May 14 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never liked him.  He seemed fairly benign starting out, like maybe he'd find a niche and grow on me/everyone else, but... he just didn't.  He never felt like a part of the team, just an outsider they kept inviting back."
thewestwing,35xf2k,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,2,Thu May 14 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"He never felt like a part of the team, just an outsider they kept inviting back.   I actually liked that about him.  I know that's weird.   I liked him enough as a character and then he wound up we wearing like 37 different hats as he bounced around, and for some reason I enjoyed that.  I think he'd have gotten boring if he'd kept the same job for three years."
thewestwing,35xf2k,EscapeSequence,2,Thu May 14 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know whatcha mean, but it was more than that.  Someone else I replied to hit the nail on the head; he feels creepy to me.  Like there's something ulterior or even a little bit shifty about him.  Maybe the way he's glib just feels more distant than the more earnest sarcasm and repartee of the other characters, I dunno.  I also wasn't a fan of his politics, and I suppose that just comes down to personal preference, but it seemed at odds with the values that'd made me fall in love with the show in the first place.  His taking up with Russel was really the nail in the coffin for me."
thewestwing,35xf2k,2Weird2Live2Rare2Die,2,Thu May 14 18:57:36 2015 UTC,Some of his deliveries of the Sorkin dialogue (or Sorkinesque dialogue) did fall a little flat.  Maybe that's what makes him seem a little creepy
thewestwing,35xf2k,EscapeSequence,2,Fri May 15 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"He was a great contrast to everyone ""established"" already in the White House.  Friendly or not, he had a great dynamic with Toby."
thewestwing,35xf2k,logopolys,3,Thu May 14 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"Lol, Dynamic, yes that's a word to use. Yes I agree that he was a good speech writer but it was him as a character that got under my skin. I don't know exactly why. Just winey I guess."
thewestwing,35xf2k,gzpz,2,Thu May 14 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"I kind of have a whole alternative story thing for Will.  While I am bothered by the huge change they put Will through where he went from idealistic and hopeful to compromising and focused on winning, I do still love him.  I just wish the writers had figured out what to do with Will later on.  He should have been a bigger voice as the show started focusing more on foreign policy and national security in the last two seasons.  I think Season 6 should have been Josh and Santos vs Toby and some other good candidate so that the viewers really didn't know who to root for.  I'd also have made Will the new Chief of Staff and put CJ in as Communications Director.  And CJ would have been the leaker, because she's always conflicted with her values and the administration's decisions.    Kind of went off on a tangent there, but in summary...I love Will Bailey."

thewestwing,35xf2k,TKay421,10,Thu May 14 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"That Star Trek girl; always making lists: ten favorite episodes, least favorite episodes, favorite galaxies, charts to see how often her favorite galaxies appear in her favorite episodes, what Romulan would she most like to see coupled with a Cardassian and why, spending a weekend talking about Romulans falling in love with Cardassians and then doing it again.  That's not being a fan. That's having a fetish."
thewestwing,35xf2k,Nuroman,2,Thu May 14 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, as someone who is a bigger Trek fan than TWW fan, that episode really bothers me.   First of all, any real Trek fan (and I can't believe whomever wrote that episode didn't research this at all) knows that Star Trek takes place in only one galaxy, our galaxy, the Milky Way.   There are no favorite galaxies or charts to see when they appear. In fact, except for one episode early in The Next Generation series, there's rarely more than a mention of another galaxy.   And that bit about coupling Romulans with Cardassians.... there's no basis for that. They just picked two alien races for that sentence. Romulans and Cardassian don't even interact with each other on the show. They are on opposite sides of the galaxy actually. They're plot lines and story archs are wholly separate and I can't even recall an episode that they appear in together.   If you want to use alien races and couple them, there are a million other combinations that make much more sense to a real Trekkie: Cardassian and Bajoran, Romulan and Vulcan, Romulan and Klingon, Klingon and Human, Human and Bajoran, etc.   Talking about these pairs would make sense because character from each of these races actually meet and interact with each other.   In fact, the only thing about that episode that the show got right was, yes, some Trekkies do wear a combadge in real life (some even go so far as to have it tattooed) and we make a ton of lists. Yes, for Trekkies, we're list crazy. And we come up with some crazy ones sometimes, but it's because Trek is so deep, there are so any episodes (over 700 I believe),  plus over a dozen movies, and literally (not exaggerating) hundreds of novels, that we just can't help but be consumed by it.   Anyway, that's my rant about that episode. Jeez, all they had to do was run that dialogue by a real Trekkie and they could have pointed out all the mistakes and corrected it for them in like 5 minutes."

thewestwing,35xf2k,scullys_heels,4,Thu May 14 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a toss up between Molly O'Brien (Leo's daughter) and Mandy (the one that disappeared without explanation.)  It's not that the actress that played either were bad. I mean, the girl that played Molly wasn't that great, but it's more of how their character was written.   Molly is so one dimensional. She has no depth. She's just a girl that likes a boy and loves her dad. There's no motivation behind her liking Sam except for that he's attractive. She has a hell of a lot of scenes for someone we barely know.   For Mandy, obviously the girl that played her has real talent. But Mandy's character started strong, then slowly went down hill. The Mandy in the first two episodes would have been great. But mid-way through season 1, she doesn't hold up. She suddenly isn't as smart as she once was and she loses her spunk. She becomes a token female side character. Also, I'm pretty sure the blonde girl in the last seasons (can't remember her name, the one that was campaigning with Leo) was supposed to be a Mandy reincarnation."
thewestwing,35xf2k,scullys_heels,13,Sat May 16 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"Mallory O'Brien btw...  Mandy is the worst character.  I think she is a terrible actor, but the character could have been a good contributing character and good foil if it were played out properly."
thewestwing,35xf2k,Polskyciewicz,11,Thu May 14 09:14:17 2015 UTC,"There's no motivation behind her liking Sam except for that he's attractive.    I'm not admonishing your choice of least favorite, but this isn't actually true. Mallory loves his writing, loves that he supported her father when Leo was under fire, loves to listen to him get all puffed up about the importance of public education, etc. It's true that she wasn't terribly developed, but she displayed plenty of reasons for being attracted to Sam other than his looks."
thewestwing,35xf2k,snack_mac_cho,-2,Thu May 14 10:52:38 2015 UTC,"But you're missing the order of events here. She didn't learn about Sam defeding Leo and that his get's all puffed up until later. She expresses an interest in him (remember the ""It's not a booty call"" and ""I do not have an itch"") all came before she knew those other things.   She asked him out on a date before she knew anything about him, exept that he slept with a call girl. Literally, she has that first conversation with him (and what girl would be attracted toa  guy that admitted to sleeping with a hooker if that's all she knew about him) and is all over him right away.   Later she learns about the things he has done and it makes sense to have her be attracted to him.   It would have been better if she hated him at firs or found his gross or seomthing, and then she gradually fell for him."
thewestwing,35xf2k,FilipinoPhil,2,Thu May 14 12:12:32 2015 UTC,"Remember when Sam said ""self-deprecation is the appetizer of charm""? That's basically the way she met him. He screwed up, then made fun of himself. Maybe she thought it was cute and she likes a man with a sense of humor. Maybe she already knew about him from her father, but decided to let it play out as if she didn't. And maybe--yes--she just thought he was attractive and wanted to get to know him better. Any or all of these are possible, because the reason you want to go on a date with someone is to see if your first impression warrants something more. Do you not go on dates with people until you know everything about them? Generally, it starts with something small."

thewestwing,35xf2k,goldandguns,5,Thu May 14 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mandy was badly-written as a character. In theory, this ""outsider media hot shot"" may have been a good foil to the senior staff. She was written as competent, intelligent, and no-nonsense. But whether it was Moira Kelly's acting being so grating, or the fact that Mandy being around the senior staff so much didn't make a lot of sense (Moira was top-billed so this was shoehorned awkwardly)... whatever it was, made Mandy as a character unlikable and annoying in the context of an otherwise perfect cast."
thewestwing,35xf2k,asdfjlk55,3,Thu May 14 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, I like the idea of Mandy, but never liked her, and this is why, she was written badly.  To me her character was defined too much by her relationship with josh, the times that she stepped out of that and contributed to the team or fought with Toby was the exception and when she shined. I think Amy suffered from the same problems, she was never able to define herself outside of the flirtation with Josh.  Both actresses did a great job with what limited opportunities they were given however."

thewestwing,35wbmc,cyrii42,2,Thu May 14 01:36:22 2015 UTC,"Veil of ignorance:       The ""veil of ignorance"", along with the original position, is a method of determining the morality of a certain issue (e.g., slavery) based upon the following thought experiment: parties to the original position know nothing about their particular abilities, tastes, and position within the social order of society. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society they will live in, the veil of ignorance prevents them from knowing about who they will be in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in slavery, it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to make choices based on self- or class-interest.

thewestwing,35gxav,rmcfall2,3,Sun May 10 06:23:54 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the pilot (and a lot of Season 1) has a lot of cringeworthy quotes/scenes, lots of super optimistic monologues with inspirational music playing in the background (like the scene in the pilot where we first see Bartlet). It also has a lot of ridiculousness (mostly centered around Mandy).

thewestwing,35gxav,mtrem225,1 point,Sun May 10 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think, like most shows, The West Wing hits its stride after the audience and the writers have really gotten used to the characters.  The pilot is great and contains some great writing, but once you're a season or two in, you'll be getting a lot more out of it."
thewestwing,35gxav,EscapeSequence,1 point,Tue May 12 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"What? It doesn't take that long to get into it. The first 25% of season 1 has Mandy as a somewhat important character. It's during that time Sorkin figures out that she doesn't fit in, and then she's already essentially being written out. It's also during that time he decides that the President will be a main character and not an occasional one as was previously intentioned. If you aren't ""getting more out of it"" by the time The Short List / In Excelsis Deo roll around, you should probably just stop watching."
thewestwing,35gxav,PardonEricAndTroy,1 point,Thu May 14 15:36:26 2015 UTC,I was hooked by the pilot. It's not a condemnation of the show to say it gets better as it progresses.
thewestwing,35gxav,EscapeSequence,1 point,Thu May 14 17:43:19 2015 UTC,I know it gets better. Season 2 is by far the best. I just meant it shouldn't take a season or two to get into it.
thewestwing,35gxav,PardonEricAndTroy,1 point,Thu May 14 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Seriously? It's one of, if not THE best-written shows of all time the first 4 seasons. But that's with Sorkin writing every single episode except one. After he leaves, it's written like any other crappy drama."
thewestwing,35gxav,PardonEricAndTroy,4,Thu May 14 15:26:53 2015 UTC,"After he leaves, it's written like any other crappy drama.   I think this is a huge overstatement.  The quality might drop a bit, season 5 is kinda weird, but the season 6-7 campaign arc is amazing, and even at it's worst, TWW is still better than 95% of television.   Not to mention, there are a whole bunch of pretty cheesy moments in the Sorkin seasons, which I feel became much less prevalent in the later seasons as the show became a bit more grounded."
thewestwing,35fif8,saffagaymer,5,Sat May 9 21:20:04 2015 UTC,Aaron Sorkin's writing in the first 4 seasons helped me learn how to articulate my political beliefs. And his dramatic flair for when Jed curses at God in Latin makes my heart sing.

It certainly doesn't drive off a cliff in the same way that Heroes or Dexter did. Even Season 5 is far better than most of the shit you see on TV."
thewestwing,35eeds,ps_,7,Sat May 9 15:26:49 2015 UTC,"i find it a bit tiring how often people new to the show come worrying about the 'drop in quality to come.' sorkin-or-not, no hourlong show is going to be able to sustain grade-A quality over the course of 22 episode seasons.  if you invest yourself in the characters, you're going to want to follow them through til the end, regardless of who's at the helm."
thewestwing,35eeds,scullys_heels,3,Sat May 9 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"I agree for any other typical show, but I say with 100% certainty that the first four seasons of West Wing had A-grade quality over each 22-episode season. That's why the quality drop was so apparent. Post-Sorkin WW is only a decent show if you didn't know how it was before.  edited to comment on your last point -- that's exactly why I hate the post-Sorkin years. I was more invested in the characters than for any other show I'd watched, and how they were written as different people was heartbreaking for me. It's easier to pretend it's a different show now."
thewestwing,35eeds,scullys_heels,2,Sun May 10 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you. Exactly. Curious -- did you watch the show as it aired, or did you Netflix it all recently? Just based on my own rather unscientific research, I find that people who have binged it all at once years after it aired are much more forgiving of the crap seasons. I'm wondering if the majority of the people on this board are all semi-recent watchers.    It aired originally in my formative college years, and I was absolutely entranced by the characters and loved them more than any before or since. And I remember when Sorkin left, everyone (my friends, the online fandom, etc.) were concerned about the potential quality drop but everyone kept watching because of the cliffhanger ending of S4. But it was insane how quickly you could tell the difference, and I couldn't stomach watching it after about the third Sorkin-less episode. Most of the online fandom I interacted with then quit watching, or kept watching but in abject horror at how the characters acted. So considering all of that, it has baffled me in the years since that new watchers (generally speaking) acknowledge the show is of a lesser quality but still consider it up to ""West Wing"" standards. Do people really need one episode a week over 4 years to truly understand characterization and that our TV friends have become pod-people? Sheesh.  Anyway, excuse the rambling. Just happy to see some fellow sense on the subject, as you said."
thewestwing,35eeds,scullys_heels,1 point,Wed May 13 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"The characters all became shells of their former selves–not even oversimplified caricatures–but they started swapping personalities, things that were fundamentally important drivers of behavior went out the window, history became meaningless, and internal conflict became the main mechanism for most plot lines. It was just such utterly lazy writing, even at its strongest.   This is what baffles me most about people who claim to love the show, but can't see how utterly backward the characters act. No one writes the actual dialogue and infused humor like Sorkin, so yeah, that's going to disappear for the most part, but the actual characterizations going to the shitter is inexcusable. Caring so little about continuity and characterization is a hallmark of a crap drama that is interested in little other than giving the network boss a scandalous clip to play on commercials throughout the week, not a show that set records for Emmy wins and raised the bar on intelligent television during a period of time when everyone else was dumbing down. The Wells Wing is a completely different show, and I just pretend it doesn't exist."

Nothing else they're saying is wrong, it's just the fact that after season 7 there is no more. You'll want to watch more, you'll care about the characters and the new and unresolved plot lines, and you'll realize that pretty much everything else on TV is hot garbage BUT there will be no more. And you'll be sad. And you'll be heartbroken.  However, even that pain is worth it because it is better to experience something wonderful and lose it than to never have seen it at all.

thewestwing,35cr0s,awinnie,9,Sat May 9 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"Well, she was a pretty hard core alcoholic for a long time...maybe still. Her scenes with Jed in private I always liked, and her scenes with Oliver Babbish are hilarious."
thewestwing,35cr0s,MisterWonka,8,Sat May 9 03:21:59 2015 UTC,I loved her in the role. She was one of my favorite characters

thewestwing,35cr0s,sarah_cate1,7,Sat May 9 05:21:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, I think she is great in West Wing too"
thewestwing,35cr0s,tanky87,5,Sat May 9 08:51:16 2015 UTC,"She's a perfect FLOTUS, and her scenes with Jed are always golden."
thewestwing,35cr0s,scullys_heels,3,Sat May 9 17:23:20 2015 UTC,Nope. I friggin loved her. I think she's perfect for the role.
thewestwing,35cr0s,kittyraces,4,Sat May 9 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"after the Zoey storyline tappers off, she isn't in as much. I thought she go more and more boring as the series went on."
thewestwing,35cr0s,snack_mac_cho,3,Sat May 9 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"I actually started watching The West Wing because of her. I'm a HUGE Grease fan and I always had this inkling that Stockard was a smart chick. I was right, she's a Radcliffe grad. During my internet research of her I came across TWW and figured I'd watch an episode to see what the fuss was about. The rest is history :)  But back to your question. I like her because I feel like because she is actually a smart, well educated woman she brought the role dignity and authenticity. Her acting isn't the greatest, I think she reacts too much. Maybe her style of acting isn't the best for TV or didn't mesh well with everyone else's. It doesn't bother me because we so rarely see her and the scenes are pretty short.   I'm just glad they didn't give Bartlet some Barbie looking trophy wife. Stockard's looks maybe aren't conventionally attractive, but I think it's more realistic that way."
thewestwing,35cr0s,honeybfly,3,Sat May 9 04:55:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad they didn't give Bartlet some Barbie looking trophy wife. Stockard's looks maybe aren't conventionally attractive, but I think it's more realistic that way.   This is a really good point. I didn't even think about it. I mean, I think Stockard Channing is hot as hell, even in her old age, but, yeah, she's not really that conventional attractive."
thewestwing,35cr0s,kittyraces,6,Sat May 9 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Her acting is more suited to theater. She plays things big and large for the 20th row, not a camera 20 feet away."

thewestwing,35cr0s,pdmcmahon,1 point,Sat May 9 22:45:33 2015 UTC,"I always felt like Stockard Channing was a better version of Moira Kelly. I didn't think she was horrible, she did the job, but she wasn't as good as it could've been. Had actresses known how big the show was going to be before the first season there would probably be a much better Abby Bartlet.   However, it's possible that the reason I feel this way is that, a lot of times, she's in opposition with Jed. Of course, my natural state is to support the President, and so her being mad at him, or whatever, makes me like her less, therefore making me like Stockard Channing less, because she plays the part perfectly."
thewestwing,35cr0s,sadfatlonely,1 point,Sat May 9 03:49:31 2015 UTC,At least Stockard Channing and Moira Kelly were able to show more enthusiasm in their performances than the sedated act that Mary Louise Parker brought to the show.

thewestwing,35cr0s,honeybfly,1 point,Sat May 9 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"I meant the character, and her personality (as well as her looks) but yeah, there were times she seemed a little...sedated."

thewestwing,35cr0s,sadfatlonely,2,Sat May 9 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I mean, they even (overtly, imo) hint at it at times! And I think it's freakin' great!"
thewestwing,35cr0s,kittyraces,1 point,Sat May 9 05:14:58 2015 UTC,Season 5 is more of a problem than Stockard Channing.
thewestwing,35cr0s,scullys_heels,3,Sat May 9 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"People warned me after sorkin left, the show goes downhill. I've still really enjoyed it, though the plot does seem to get a little....busy...at times. What other specific complaints do people levy against the later seasons?"
thewestwing,35cr0s,scullys_heels,1 point,Sat May 9 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"While I expected the downgrade in classic Sorkin dialogue, it's the characterization that ruins everything. Basically, there's rampant character assassination across the board. No one acts like themselves. The camaraderie is gone. The show loses its humor and becomes like a bad ER-esque soap opera version of itself. It sucks and I don't acknowledge it as the same show.  Edit to clarify: it's like John Wells went from background exec producer to main showrunner, and he didn't know how to do a drama that wasn't ER, Third Watch... that type. So he took established characters on a show that already had a certain style and wedged them into this soapy ~drama~ world like he did with his other shows. It's awkward and terrible, and frankly it's a crime what happened to characters that I'd spent  the previous 4 years considering my favorites ever. Ugh."

I think they did a pretty good job at the beginning of demonstrating just how unknown of a candidate he was and how clumsy he was being as a campaigner.  I mean, I was pretty sure they wouldn't have had Josh latch onto him like that if they were just going to have him crash and burn, but it still seemed like such a longshot that I felt like there was decent amount of suspense."

This rewatch, for some reason, made it really hit home the lack of quality after Sorkin left. I've always known seasons 1-4 are the best, but after this rewatch it was almost hard to get to decent episodes (hence the skipping much of the 5th and 6th seasons). The acting is still great, obviously, but nuances of the show are lost after season 4 (feel free to downvote me because I don't remember examples, I didn't take notes of them, but they are there). It's a shame, and I blame NBC for Sorkin leaving, I just imagine what he could've done in 7 seasons."

Sound is a huge part of triggers for me. Fireworks in particular will have my heart rate up and in total fight or flight mode. I feel like a Labrador every Fourth of July. Just hate it.   When I first got back, I was watching the film Restrepo with my girlfriend on the couch, and when they hit an IED five minutes into the film, I knocked her on the floor as I jumped to my feet.   But I can go to the range without issue. I can train with artillery sims and blanks all day and all night. Hell, I can watch most war movies without batting an eye.   The main key here is context. Gunfire doesn't bother me when I'm in a situation where I expect gunfire. Likewise, I think the sirens that are part of a normal routine wouldn't be an issue for Josh. But when he encounters sounds that catch him off guard and put his mind back into those moments, he starts to react to those moments even if he's just having a drink in his apartment or briefing the president."

There are a couple cool articles about The West Wing:   Top 5 Constitutional Mistakes Top 5 Constitutional Zingers (more fun than necessarily informative, but still) Top 5 Constitutional Moments Top 5 Predictions   I'm stealing some clips from those links.  S02 E16: The Stackhouse Filibuster, clip here. It has to do with a filibuster in the Senate.  S04 E22: Twenty-Five, clip here. It has to do with the 24th Amendment.  S05 E07: Separation of Powers, clip here. For some background: the Republican-controlled Congress is negotiating with the Democrat President over the federal budget. Also, a ""CR"" is a ""continuing resolution"". It's like a temporary budget rather than a budget for a whole year.

It does a very good interpretation of how the gov works from republican nut jobs trying to block whatever bill that the President favors to "" pork barrel politics "". Back room deals are the norm and of course all the "" donations "" that big money gives to both parties that want something in return . The episode on the stackhouse fillibuster was a very good example of what the republican controlled House was doing during all the obama care issues a few years ago . Now that the Dems lost both the house and senate you will see a lot of vetos coming up , that will be a interesting example of just how our gov is broken really beyond repair unless big money gets out of the picture . But as in the series campaign reform is just about impossible since politicans love money , it equals to power and that is what counts in their minds . Why else become one in the first place , maybe as in season 1 they thought that change was possible but when reality steps in it comes as a shock to the whole white house staff , a good example was 25 votes .

I remember in the flashback with his father his mother is spoken about in present tense, implying that she is alive (plus if he'd lost his mother at that young an age you think it would have been mentioned while he was talking about his father to the therapist), but she doesn't seem to be around.  I take it by the present day storylines she is supposed to be deceased (since she would be really quite old by that point and Bartlett never mentions her as alive or visiting her), but its not clear what happened to her. I always thought it was weird how little she is mentioned in comparison to his father who it focuses on his destructive relationship with and he talks about being dead all the time - it seems implied that he is closer to this mother (to the point that he embraced her religion) but never really talks about her while he has a picture of his dad on his desk."

I can't remember but I think Leo mentioned it again a few times.    Another was when Josh was interviewing Joe Quincy for the council position and Joe Quincy was referring to Josh's PTSD from Rosslin (the classical music trigger).  It took me a while to realize this because I 1) didn't remember the trigger in my first watch and 2) wasn't aware of how prevalent this knowledge of josh's personal life was public.    Another was how well the young Mrs. Landingham performed.  Not exactly re-occurring, but I was very convinced of young Mrs. Landingham being Mrs. Landingham than young Bartlett was President Bartlett.    but a personal favorite: Kenny.  I almost hear his voice whenever I think about just Joey Lucas.  I was kinda sad when he was replaced that one time.    Actually it was the reappearance of all the minor characters that were given a descent personality: Babish, Fitz, President Walken, and that one AP reporter that was in all the press briefing shots (3rd or 4th row, 2nd or 3rd from the left I think).  They all really stood out to me.    There are other people that might fit minor characters (like the daughters, Danny, Hoynes, Bingo Bob) but played a more permanent, prominent role that swapping actors might be a bit jarring, but I think they're pretty noteworthy they were repeated.    I mentioned this below, but I was disappointed when Justice Mendoza didn't make a reappearance after the first season.    Just as a side note: I generally ""watch"" sitcoms.  Mostly for some background noise while cooking, etc.  There guest stars seem pretty expendable on these shows.  I have no idea how actor contracts work in the show biz, but when I see this kind of character reappearance it really make me think they (producers/writers) really care about the quality and timelessness of their work."

Speaking after an honorary arts doctorate was conferred on him by the National University of Ireland, Sheen joked that he would be the ""oldest undergraduate"" at the National University of Ireland (NUI), Galway, when he started his full-time studies there in the autumn of 2006. Although expressing concern that he might be a ""distraction"" to other students at NUIG, he attended lectures like everyone else. Speaking the week after filming his last episode of The West Wing, he said, ""I'm very serious about it."" He once said, ""I never went to college when I was young and am looking forward to giving it a try . . . at age 65!""  On September 1, 2006, Sheen was among the first to register as a student at NUI Galway.  He left the University after completing a semester.

First off it ends on a cliffhanger, so I can't see how you can just stop. 5-7 might not be the brilliance of Sorkin we have come to expect, but it is still good televsion. Season 5 is going to be tough, you are going to be frustrated, at least a little, but it gets better, and its all certainly worth watching."

It's not like Haffley would go ""well, I hate his budget, but he appointed Walken VP, so let him have it.""   All it would've done is make the democrats harder to work with.

This process worked so well (#sarcasm)  that they had to create an amendment to the constitution to fix the resulting chaos it created, not the least of which was that the Offices of the President and Vice President could hardly build a coalition around having eggs for breakfast let alone agree on policy.  In 20 Hours in L.A. (S01E16), they find the unique situation in which there is a 50/50 tie in the Senate over the Ethanol Bill. Now this is a bad example Spoiler but imagine trying to convince the VP to vote against his own party.  ....ok I might have just accidentally wrote the premise of the most Sorkin episode ever.   As for Russell, while I think Barlett would have put up a bigger fight, I can believe that he would ultimately be forced to pick Bingo Bob. I mean, he kinda hated Hoynes too but picked him because he carried Texas politically it was the right move to make."

It replaced Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, which provided the original procedure by which the Electoral College functioned. Problems with the original procedure arose in the elections of 1796 and 1800. The Twelfth Amendment refined the process whereby a President and a Vice President are elected by the Electoral College. The amendment was proposed by the Congress on December 9, 1803, and was ratified by the requisite three–fourths of state legislatures on June 15, 1804.

thewestwing,317eav,allbeefpatties,-6,Thu Apr 2 16:24:40 2015 UTC,He's my least favorite character in the series.

Each episode I just want to like Cher slap him...Snap out of it!   Poor Otto.
thewestwing,317eav,allbeefpatties,11,Thu Apr 2 16:27:29 2015 UTC,IMO his downfall was that he was so good yet so short-sighted.  They elude to just what you mentioned several times in the series.  He was the 'hammer' that Bartlett sent when politics wouldn't work.
thewestwing,317eav,maerdred,9,Thu Apr 2 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"Wow. He's by far my favorite character in the whole series. At least until Season 5, he's written perfectly. The rest of the cast seems to waver a bit, as the writers try to define them, or redefine them. Josh is always just Josh."

thewestwing,317eav,Fatjedi007,18,Fri Apr 3 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. It is pretty awkward. Apparently Allison Janney lip synced on set a lot, and the cast thought it was great.

thewestwing,30j8mj,nuketesuji,27,Fri Mar 27 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"I think at least a bit of it is that President Bartlet is angry with himself for doing something he knows was wrong, lying to the American people.  He takes it out on Toby, who righty feels betrayed and dismayed that this person who he would go to war for has lied to him.  I think it humanizes the President in a big way."
thewestwing,30j8mj,jhillwastaken,11,Fri Mar 27 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there is a lot of inner conflict with Jed in the MS arc, which culminates with this scene in H. Con-172. He feels guilty, he's probably felt guilty before this, but with Toby's discovery he knows everyone is about to know. The people who hate him, and the people who love him.  Yes, he was being petty, yes it wasn't like he's character's normal reaction, but he's normally not morally wrong."
thewestwing,30j8mj,sadfatlonely,34,Sat Mar 28 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"It made sense to me. Toby's response was outrage. A decent human being would start with health concerns.  I love Toby, but Jed had it right."
thewestwing,30j8mj,trager,13,Fri Mar 27 21:52:05 2015 UTC,Not for me. The sheer time and planning involved hits harder. I'm with Toby.
thewestwing,30j8mj,Tchocky,6,Sat Mar 28 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"if he was any average Joe, i would absolutely agree. But Toby is right, that's why Toby refers to it as a Coup d'eat. Jed is Toby's president, his boss, not his friend, at least not first. Also all these stresses have been brought on largely voluntarily. Its not like he was diagnosed with MS in office, that would be a different case."
thewestwing,30j8mj,panda1229,9,Sat Mar 28 04:20:26 2015 UTC,I think the President is very defensive about hiding the MS. That's why he doesn't even apologize for weeks. I think the point is that it humanizes him. He reacts like anyone would when they mess up big time but don't really want to admit it.
thewestwing,30j8mj,hamiltonlives,15,Sat Mar 28 14:00:41 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a great scene. Toby is angrier than Jed is at the moment. Jed is mad that someone found out and is trying to be defensive in the situation even though he knows he's in the wrong, which he later admits. Jed realized this is a major turning point in his life/presidency."
thewestwing,30j8mj,another_name,7,Fri Mar 27 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing about Jed Barlet. I know we all love him, but the truth is, he's arrogant and a bit of a prick. He can be one of the most generous and thoughtful people you've ever known, but he's also moody, entitled, and needs to have his ego stroked.   If you recognize and accept this about him, his behaviour in this scene makes perfect sense."

thewestwing,30j8mj,Four_Kings,8,Fri Mar 27 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"Do you know why it feels jarring?  Because President Bartlet is not at his best, and he's wrong, but at that moment unable to intellectually accept it.  I think his answer, and emotional state are best summarized by the line:   'Cause you're not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports to close. Not every part of me belongs to you. This was personal. I'm not willing to relinquish that right.   It wasn't so much a principled position as one of the most stressed out people on the planet not being simultaneously strong enough to be hurt for something that was never his fault. Not while that other something was also ravaging him.  It was, now that I think of it, one of his best moments of anger. And it was totally in keeping with the Two Bartlets speech that comes from Toby, and in retrospect only could've come from Toby.   Well, there’s always been a concern... about the two Bartlets: The absent-minded professor with the “Aw, Dad” sense of humor. Disarming and unthreatening. Good for all time zones. And the Nobel Laureate. Still searching for salvation. Lonely, frustrated. Lethal.   It strikes me that Toby's position has pretty much always been that we need that level of hurt and empathy in the oval office so we better start electing for it openly."

It would've effectively disqualified him from being President if it were known.   didn't he deserve at least some of it for hiding it   A little bit, yeah. I do think the electorate should get to weigh the neurological health of a candidate... I just don't think they're very qualified to do so. Note what happened when a governor with a health condition risk factor (40+ BMI) roughly as dangerous as being a heavy smoker (As per The Lancet) was rumoured as a possible Presidential candidate.  Then make it a disease that the general public understands even less.  I would've forgiven him. This is the kind of elitism that makes sense."

thewestwing,30emmg,shakyt,17,Thu Mar 26 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Hartsfield Landing is a fabricated place. It's based on a handful of places that vote early, specifically Dixville Notch.  It doesn't really let them compete, but the semi-open primary process lets voters change affiliation at the voting place to pick primary (or it does for real in NH, so we'll assume it does.) So even with a non-competitive Democratic primary, the number of votes Barlet would get compared to Richie would still matter, and they would need to get people to choose to vote in the non-competitive election instead of the competitive GOP primary. And lastly, the results are broadcast until the polls close in the rest of the state, because the polls officially close when everyone votes in Dixville Notch at midnight.  So, Bartlet needs to get more total votes, even when he would win no matter what, otherwise it's a full day of talking about how Richie got more votes than Bartlet, which could also help him in the overall NH primary."
thewestwing,30emmg,jckgat,6,Thu Mar 26 20:48:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for that excellent explanation.  I have been left in a mild state of British confusion every time I've seen this episode.
thewestwing,30emmg,city17_dweller,3,Thu Mar 26 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they really don't explain it well.  You don't even know who Richie is running against, except for the Majority Leader, and the only reason you know that is because of the rambling answer he gives in Gone Quiet that's a lift of what Ted Kennedy actually said in 1979, which I'm sure you'd have no way of knowing.  There's other things like that throughout the show that are lifts of actual events.  But because you don't know of anyone else running, it seems like Bartlet is running against Richie when he really isn't.  Except he is.  Realistically, it doesn't really matter in a primary where there's only one candidate and the other is competitive how many votes the non-competitive candidate gets.  However, it would have been embarrassing if only 2 or 3 people voted for Bartlet.  It's somewhat overblown.  It matters much more when both primaries are competitive who wins these vote at midnight places."
thewestwing,30emmg,jckgat,2,Thu Mar 26 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Great responses jckgat, thanks. So for the rest of the primary will it just be voting for the Republican primary and not Bartlett in a non competitive vote as well?  Also if the sitting President decides to go for another term are they automatically on the ticket or do they ever have to have another primary?"
thewestwing,30emmg,jckgat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, party primaries are separate. There's registration dates, but generally if you don't win one of the first few contests then you drop out. The times where that hasn't been what has happened are few. This system is also relatively recent. The conventions used to pick the nominee without any primaries as recently as the 50s.   Rule of thumb though is you never challenge a sitting President in a primary.  US Presidents are limited to two terms, but for re-election they have to go through the primary process again. I can't think of a sitting President that didn't win their primary that also ran in it though. LBJ didn't run in 1968 and I think he's the only exception."
thewestwing,30emmg,mtrem225,2,Fri Mar 27 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"It is a little dumb how Bartlet gets so into this election. I'm a Dem in a state with an open primary (MA). If the Democratic incumbent doesn't have a challenger, I'm absolutely voting in the GOP primary. Why wouldn't you? So while I would have voted for Bartlet if it were a general election, in a primary, I would have voted for Richie or which ever Republican I was least afraid would lose to Bartlet."
thewestwing,30emmg,jerryrice88,6,Fri Mar 27 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"I've always been confused by this episode.  It feels like it is during the general election, between Bartlett and Richie, but the timeline puts it during the primaries."
thewestwing,30emmg,indyK1ng,3,Thu Mar 26 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"Another user answered since you commented, but I'll summarize.  In NH there's a semi-open primary where voters can change their party affiliation at the polling place before they vote.  You can't vote in a primary for a party you're not affiliated with.  This means that while Bartlet and Richie aren't competing to win for their party's primary, but they are competing for votes from the same pie."
thewestwing,30emmg,indyK1ng,2,Thu Mar 26 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"Right, so in a primary you have to be registered with the party (democrat or republican) to cast a vote? Then in a presidential you vote for who you want without a affiliation."

Compare it to Bartlet in Take This Sabbath Day again it is a story where a character makes a decision that ends with death. Compare Han, which isn't death, but possibly as bad a fate. I could go on, making decisions, even decisions with terrible consequences does not make a bad character. This was a moment that the character showed an amazing potential for growth and change, and the set-up made it seem that this was about to happen. Then she was sent to rule over Mandyville."
thewestwing,30enia,TrappedUnderCats,3,Thu Mar 26 20:00:47 2015 UTC,The story the priest tells Bartlet at the end of Take This Sabbath Day is one of my all time favorite TWW moments.
thewestwing,30enia,skywaterblue,3,Thu Mar 26 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"I think the problem was not necessarily the character per se - she could be brash and irritating at times, but that's true of most characters on the show - but the fact that she didn't seem like she was in the same show as everyone else. It's particularly jarring in the first few episodes when the Mandy scenes are so different from everything else going on. I almost wince in the pilot when it suddenly switches to that incredibly brightly lit sequence of Mandy driving along shouting into her phone; the tone is nothing like anything else in the show. They made her too separate from the rest of the characters and then could never integrate her into the action properly."
thewestwing,30enia,mtrem225,2,Thu Mar 26 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the analysis, but not with the conclusion. I think what you are doing is underscoring my earlier point that she is the most unique character in the show. She gave the show a bit of syncopation. Her contrast brought out other characters, and she also stood out in her own right."
thewestwing,30enia,valeriekeefe,3,Fri Mar 27 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"I like her way better than Amy, who is a really one note character for me."
thewestwing,30enia,sarah_cate1,3,Sun Mar 29 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"Yes.  The show was trying to establish itself as somewhat serious and realistic, but the 2nd or 3rd time we see her she drives her car up onto a sidewalk, and all she does after that is get a bunch of trivial storylines and get in trouble for writing about Bartlet's weaknesses while working for someone else. We only get her for one season, and it's possible she would have gotten better if she hadn't bolted to become Lucas Scott's mom on One Tree Hill, but she's one of the few reasons I don't love rewatching S1."
thewestwing,30enia,duh_metrius,2,Fri Mar 27 18:37:40 2015 UTC,You are not alone. I do think the way she was introduced was clumsy though.
thewestwing,30enia,CaptSmallShlong,2,Fri Mar 27 04:50:52 2015 UTC,In the first season Mandy reminds me so much of Rizzo in Grease. Just her line reads and rebelliousness. I guess it's fitting the original Rizzo is involved.

Every person who is on the senior staff could walk into any private lobby and make 5 or 10 times what they make in the White House strictly based on their experience. Sam and CJ both left jobs making close to half a million a year to work for Bartlet, they could easily go back to making that or more."

CJ said she was making $500 and change when talking to Toby about pay. Those are the only two people who mention anything about their private sector pay except Leo.   There is no way he would make close to that while working for the government. President Obama makes just a little over that now."

The median household income is about $90,000[2].  Compare that to the US average of about $50,000[3].  She'd be making making higher than average for the area, yes. But Press Secretary is a very highly placed, high profile position; a person in this position would demand much higher salaries in the private sector.  However, an assistant level staffer in the White House made $42,000/year in 2013[4]. That's $33,272 after Federal[5] and District[6] income taxes, without deductions.  The average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment outside of city center is found to be about $1,400/month[7], or $16,800/year.  That leaves $22,830  or $407/week for food, clothes (which would be a lot considering you have to dress for business every day), utilities, cell phone, entertainment, travel (I'd want to get home more than once), and all other expenses for the year.

Some people work at the white house, if they can, for the experience but I guess for the senior staff (at least in the series) they most likely have had quite a lot saved up and can go down a few levels in pay grade."

Maybe I'm over-thinking it though"
thewestwing,308g07,RedBuffalo1427,6,Wed Mar 25 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you, and I don't think you are over-thinking it.  But I still hate those people for acting the way they do.  I guess seeing the primary characters on the other side (and even several seasons ahead) makes you judge the secondary characters who hadn't seen those primary characters evolve yet.  It's tough to compare because Toby was failing at his job, yet felt OK enough to sit in a bar and drink, discussing his ""political operative"" status.  Josh was ""failing"" at his goal by settling for Hoynes, yet he wanted Hoyes to be elected because he didn't see any other option.  Sam was struggling the most, failing to convince the Gage Whitney Pace partner and their client that the Indio was a bad investment.  They all ""failed"" right before joining the Bartlet for America.    Anyway, now I'm 1/2 way through ""In the Shadow of Two Gunmen: Part 2"" and Governor Bartlett is offering to go with Josh after his father died. So I guess my faith in humanity is restored, for now."

thewestwing,307ids,WelcomeToBoshwitz,6,Wed Mar 25 13:56:01 2015 UTC,Two liberal judges. First Latino (in that world) and first female Chief.  Your dismissal of a tax credit to pay for college says a lot.  Minimum wage increase.  FEC folks who wanted Campaign Finance reform.  Extreme act of patriotism by stepping down through the 25th when his daughter was kidnapped.  China summit resulting in North Korea talks.  Actually working with Russia.  Stepping in to try and prevent a genocide in Kundu.  Good crisis management in regards to a potential nuclear meltdown.  Prevented a third world war in the twilight hours of a presidential election.
thewestwing,307ids,eonge,-2,Wed Mar 25 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"The majority of those are crisis'; I will admit, he is very good at handling them.  But, in terms of long term change, I just don't see it.  I'm not dismissing the tax credit, I think it was wonderful, just not enough to be the hallmark of a presidency.  The North Korea talks didn't amount to any actual change, nor did the finance reform.  The two I had forgotten were the minimum wage increase and the second judge, and the second judge, while great, again, isn't something that will hit the history books."
thewestwing,307ids,RuafaolGaiscioch,3,Wed Mar 25 18:28:08 2015 UTC,I disagree that the first Female Chief would have been dismissed.  Management of crises is the major thing Presidents do. John Adams' presidency was taken up completely by a crisis.
thewestwing,307ids,eonge,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"I missed the Chief aspect, sorry.  Yeah, I disagree with me as well.  And you're right that management of crisis' is an important thing, and the Bartlet administration performed very well.  However, there is still a serious disconnect between what they claim to want to accomplish, and what they actually do.  Over and over, from season 1 on down to 7, the same mantra is repeated by various characters: we're not here to get elected, we're here to govern.  It's a admirable aspiration, and, unfortunately, an extremely rare one.  Also unfortunately, it seems to be a lie, or at the very least, mass self-delusion.  For all the main characters' rhetoric about governance, democracy, and affecting change, their actual actions are way more in line with maintaining the status quo.  Josh is arguably the biggest contributor to this.  How often does he ever really consider that the inside track, beltway way of doing things is undemocratic and destructive?  And how many times does he capitulate on doing the right thing because it could cost them votes down the line, because ""Someone's got to think about the ninth year.""  He's way more concerned with making sure the Democrats hold power as long as possible, and the rest of the cast, to varying degrees (except Toby; love Toby) have the same priorities.

thewestwing,30457i,Dream_Out_Loud,5,Tue Mar 24 13:50:58 2015 UTC,i get that it's idealized.  and there are definitely some issues that have caused me to rethink some things that I've thought.  I've tried not to get to attached to what West Wing Republicans say because those words are written by Democrats.  But there are plenty of times that West Wing Democrats will say something and i'll totally disagree.  but the writing is impeccable.  and enthralling.

I'm a Republican but I'm not a gun guy at all.  i'm a heretic that way.  but in the aftermath of Rosslyn, CJ points out that many others were shot that night and that those opposed to gun control should note that the person with the best armed body guards was still shot.  she's right, but thanks to those guns, no ""good guys"" were killed and the bad guys were shot and killed in less than 10 seconds.  I felt it was a cheap argument that wasn't particularly well thought out.    i'm sure there are more.  i'll keep thinking."

But I don't think they have any particular attachment to him, except perhaps Josh, and Leo marginally less so.   I'm sure there are politicians that Bartlet can respect more who he might want on the ticket with him. IIRC 1998 was about uniting the ticket and finding a southerner to appeal to the South.   It just feels like every time Hoynes was brought up, Bartlet's reaction was an eye roll, and Hoynes had just undermined Bartlet by starting to campaign for president himself. It seemed strange to me that Bartlet would suddenly show so much trust in Hoynes."

I think it's one of the few non-Sorkin episodes that Sorkin would actually enjoy....if he were to actually watch them. All of Season 7 was really great television, imo."
thewestwing,300ki5,Dream_Out_Loud,3,Mon Mar 23 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed; I thought the election storyline was pretty lefty (unprecedented convention fight; then a general consisting of a socially moderate, agnostic Republican vs. liberal Democrat) but generally very good.  Tomorrow was a good series finale. Wrapped things up well. But it predictably isn't exactly exciting or suspenseful, so I'd probably put that one toward the bottom of the list (or remove it completely because it's a completely different animal than a typical season finale)."
thewestwing,300ki5,Dream_Out_Loud,5,Mon Mar 23 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"I think the most impressive part of Season 7 is that they made a lot of the liberal viewers (myself included) OK with the idea of having Vinick win. Obviously he was nothing like today's GOP.  I think a lot of my love for Tomorrow was because it was the right time and right way to end it. Taking cliffhangers into effect, my vote would be Posse Comitatus."

But Vinnick bears no resemblance to today's GOP because he is a fictional character written by people who have an agenda.  Sorkin and the other writers created their dream liberal President in Bartlett and their dream Republican opponent in Vinnick.  it's fine.  they are the show's creators and have all the right in the world to do what they want. but you wouldn't want Karl Rove writing a democratic character, would you?  :)"

thewestwing,300ki5,Polskyciewicz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah, if there's one thing I find a bit annoying about TWW is that any presence of a Republican in the White House makes the entire staff glare through their blinds like their mortal enemy just walked into the room. It happens both times when Vinnick visits the White House, but the fact that the show thought the bigger cliffhanger would be Walken taking office, and not the President's daughter being kidnapped, kind of shows why conservatives can't stand this show (despite having many examples of smart/competent Republicans throughout the years)."
thewestwing,3017cs,elcub,8,Mon Mar 23 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"i have never understood why they chose Leo to be the running mate for Santos.

thewestwing,3017cs,Dream_Out_Loud,2,Mon Mar 23 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"I think the obvious choice would be Berryhill, though we don't know much about him. He was willing to be Bartlet's VP once Hoynes resigned, I'm sure he'd do it for Santos if asked. Plus, Berryhill is a former Secretary of State, and pretty much fills the foreign policy void that they tabbed Leo to fill. And he's competent and scary to the GOP - Hapley forced the Dems to go with Russell because they didn't want to be facing off against a candidate Berryhill in 2006."

thewestwing,3017cs,Dream_Out_Loud,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"Well, Baker ended up being the nominee for VP (Santos insisted that he be confirmed by Congress rather than asking the electoral college to vote for him)."

thewestwing,300fbj,Blue_Checkers,3,Mon Mar 23 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"Agree. He filled in the gaps on his own. There's an earlier scene where Leo is talking with someone and they're discussing a classified report and it's something like ""I can't tell you that there's a report but I can tell you that it's the DOD that classified it.""  Enough info there to know there's a report.   Also, Toby manipulated Greg Brock to get the story out to compel the result Toby thought was right. He had the hint from his brother, all but confirmed by the inferences drawn from CJ's questions."
thewestwing,300fbj,harmless-error,2,Mon Mar 23 17:05:43 2015 UTC,"Just for information the episode with Leo talking about the DoD classifying a document is Life on Mars -Season 4, ep. 20."
thewestwing,300fbj,sadfatlonely,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:24:47 2015 UTC,My only issue with this theory is that they discounted Kelwick and the other NASA personnel as too many of the technical details were incorrect in Brock's story.  If Toby's only sources were allusions to it by his David and CJ then surely he wouldn't have any meaningful details at all.
thewestwing,300fbj,sobusyimbored,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"Presumably the military shuttle would be largely similar to the NASA one. After all, the Soviet shuttle was a literal copy.

Toby won't insult his dead brother's memory by allowing him to take the fall for Toby's choice, even posthumously.  Even though it means a prison sentence away from his children.   Why did he do it?  He's an activist, he believes in the public's right to know. And after MS and Abdul Sharief, he no longer trusts Bartlet and Leo to stand by their principles."

thewestwing,2ztodv,NewMerril,9,Sat Mar 21 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Well the Santo Presidency should be over by now and unless Sam has been really busy filling his CV with elected positions I doubt he'd be capable of getting elected, but quite frankly I'm happy with how the West Wing ended and don't feel any desire for a re-boot"
thewestwing,2ztodv,tc1991,3,Sat Mar 21 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"If they got Sorkin, or another writer of his calibre (and there are not many) I would like to see a reboot. I think what I would most like to see would be Sorkin-quality writing but with a conservative protagonist. Someone like (but not) Vinick. I loved the West Wing, and it really help make me who I am today, but I am a bit older now and would love to see some of my ideas challenged.   Cliff Calley as Deputy Chief of Staff could be interesting.   Edit. I also think a show focusing on other aspects of the executive would be interesting. What about White House Council? First Lady? Or take it from the other side and have it about a White House reporter or lobbyist."
thewestwing,2ztodv,whipped_honey,3,Sun Mar 22 00:10:40 2015 UTC,Cliff Calley was the Dep. CoS after Josh quit to run the Santos Campaign

thewestwing,2ztodv,whipped_honey,2,Sun Mar 22 04:14:27 2015 UTC,"Considering Sorkin's background & political ideology, I highly doubt that he would return to write about a republican administration.  It would probably have to fall into Peggy Noonan's lap."

thewestwing,2ztodv,Mister_Bubbles,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"Reading this was painful. I didn't even realize that there was a chance of a revival - it'd be absolutely amazing, X-Files, Twin Peaks and the West Wing all coming back? That'd be incredible. Especially reading the synopsis of what the two potential storylines could be.  I am surprised though at the utter disregard for the American people - it has only been a decade since the show went off the air and it was popular at the time and is part of popular culture today I'd say to some extent. It isn't like the people who made the show popular and loved it 'all those years ago' aren't around now - they're still watching TV!  NBC is interesting, they always have these great franchises, all this potential to make amazing television, shows that can push it to the art form it is, and then they always drop it and go with the lowest common denominator. As television is falling to the wayside of online media consumption through Netflix and others they should be trying to push the bar higher, give people a reason to come back to their channel and watch it.  I do hope that this isn't really the final bit, I'd love to see more of the West Wing, especially since here in Canada we're never going to see 'Sussex Drive'. ;)"
thewestwing,2ztodv,Lynn_L,4,Sat Mar 21 18:59:35 2015 UTC,It's from a satirical website.  Not real.
thewestwing,2ztodv,xicougar106,0,Sun Mar 22 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"I would cheer a reboot.  I personally would hope for a conservative that would be given the same fair lens that a liberal got, but I'm not delusional enough to think that'd happen (the urinal scene is about as fair as it could get on NBC, which I can live with).  Of the 2 options I'd prefer a Sam centric series."

thewestwing,2ziej9,snack_mac_cho,5,Wed Mar 18 20:55:10 2015 UTC,This is definitely a great episode. But my favourite scenes are the ones between Leo and Josh. They are basically the final step of Leo grooming Josh to replace him.

thewestwing,2ziej9,amishius,4,Thu Mar 19 01:32:55 2015 UTC,There are so many reasons that the VP might not be there.  Did Bingo Bob go to Lassiter's funeral? At least as big an occasion as the dedication of the library. I don't believe he was there.
thewestwing,2ziej9,WalterSkinnerFBI,-4,Thu Mar 19 01:46:34 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but did I say something about Russell? Why indeed would he be there to the extent that we would care?
thewestwing,2ziej9,amishius,4,Thu Mar 19 01:49:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the person, I'm talking about the office. Forget that it's Leo in the one case or Russell in the other, just as Bartlett asks to be addressed as the president so that he thinks of the office rather than the man. Why would the VP be at the dedication at the beginning of S7?"
thewestwing,2ziej9,WalterSkinnerFBI,0,Thu Mar 19 02:10:11 2015 UTC,"Ohhhhh- I was thinking more about Leo as CoS/JB's best friend, not as an office holder. I mean, why is a congressman or professor at Columbia there?"
thewestwing,2ziej9,amishius,2,Thu Mar 19 03:13:02 2015 UTC,Leo has duties and he is also a part of the line of succession. Could have been any number of reasons.
thewestwing,2ziej9,WalterSkinnerFBI,3,Thu Mar 19 11:00:57 2015 UTC,"Though it may be obvious to you, this didn't appear to be the case for a while. Many said they intended for Vinick to win until John Spencer's death. This was well-documented in a number of articles, but then more information came out about the fact that Santos was always supposed to win.  Older article: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/arts/television/10wing.html?_r=3&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1387819953-uuIwcU4/7f9FaSpNxC6eNw&  Legends Revealed article: http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2013/01/21/what-arnold-vinick-going-to-win-the-presidency-on-the-west-wing-before-john-spencers-untimely-death/"

Except for being in Latin, the entire rant is the kind of whiny bullshit any teenager might say to his parents because he changes his mind right away. And the hands in the pockets turn of his head thing has no heft to it if he's already made up his mind, which he supposedly had. In this episode, I see Bartlet not as some powerful figure at the center of the show's universe but just another flip-flopping lying politician."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ObligatoryHandle,11,Sun Mar 15 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"It's SUPPOSED to sound whiny.  He's sad, and pissed and beaten down. He's taking it all out of God because he feels like his life is unfair and he is blaming God. He HAD made up his mind in that moment - not to run because he thinks it's fruitless. Then the vision/ conversation with Landingham's ghost changes his mind. She basically says ""get over yourself, you sound ridiculous.""  She even says ""God doesn't crash cars and you know it. Stop using me as an excuse"" The numbers exchange is her saying ""you know you need to run again, to finish what you started and do good.""  THAT'S when he changed his mind.  I encourage you to rewatch it with that mindset - I think it'll change your opinion."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,SuddenAborealStop,-3,Sun Mar 15 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"All that is true, but none of it makes Jed a better man. Mrs. Landingham isn't really there talking to him. It's just his subconscious mind making excuses for abandoning his promises to God and Abby and running for reelection because he likes being President. Jed is immoral and untrustworthy in the cliffhanger, just like he was with the MS lie.  Everything that's wrong with the arc of Will McAvoy (in the first season, anyway) is on display right here. A pompous man of high culture knows what's good and what's right, and the American people need him. His white skin and rich blood sweeps him into a position of great importance even before becoming the Great Man he should be. We should be obliged to support him because he'll be deserving of his position eventually.   But the Jed who puts his hands in his pockets is the same Jed who rants at God is the same Jed in the teenage flashbacks. He's not really the ""real deal"" that inspires Josh to leave the Hoynes campaign. He says ""you get Hoynes"" to God, but we've already got a Hoynes in him. In this moment, he's at his lowest in the arc of his greatness. This is why it never makes sense to me that this is seen as the high point in the show's drama. No other episode is more dependent on the entirety of the series for its power."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ObligatoryHandle,4,Sun Mar 15 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"All that is true, but none of it makes Jed a better man.   If you don't think that every single character in TWW is flawed in a variety of ways, I don't think you understand TWW.   Mrs. Landingham isn't really there talking to him. It's just his subconscious mind making excuses for abandoning his promises to God and Abby and running for reelection because he likes being President.   You left off the part where he then mentally kicks himself for doing and thinking what he's doing and thinking.  You're right, it isn't Mrs Landingham telling him to stop feeling sorry for himself, he's telling himself to rub some dirt on it and get back into the game.  Nobility of character doesn't come from being perfect, it comes from trying to do the right thing in spite of our own shortcomings.  To wit: ""'I don't always know what the right thing to do is, my Lord, but I think the fact that I want to please you pleases you."""
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ProbablyNotJohnSaxon,0,Thu Mar 19 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"Aside from the ""you don't understand the West Wing"" snark, you make good points. But, I still disagree with the premise that any of this displays a nobility of character in Jed.   The decision to run again is always presented as a ""we win"" scenario - that the American people are better off because they still have Bartlet. But, he's not doing the right thing so often in this episode that I just don't buy it. The right thing would have been to not hide his MS. The right thing would be to keep his promise to Abby. He does so much to question my loyalty to his judgment.  That this sort of assumption of my loyalty to his judgment comes right after the rant at God and Mrs. Landingham's ghost dream... I don't know quite how to phrase this... I get what Sorkin is going for here, and what others much see as a wonderfully dramatic juxtaposition. But, for me, it has the opposite effect. Jed is attacking what he sees as God's Will, or at least what the institution of the church demands of its followers. There is a perspective (especially common in the politically liberal side that the show comes from) that this is the right thing to do. And I certainly can agree that it is the right thing to reject that God wants Hoynes because of the lie Jed told and His taking Mrs. Landingham. But, like he rejects that judgment, I reject his and his moral fiber in the moment he puts his hands in his pockets.  In that moment, he is self-righteous and morally pragmatic. And I want a man who is dedicated to his country and party, and who is pragmatic politically. The man who lies to voters and breaks promises even to his wife is not a man who seems like he can win an election (in a fictional world, anyway), or that I even want to vote for (and they want you to want to vote for Bartlet)."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ObligatoryHandle,3,Thu Mar 19 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the reason you feel this sort of confusion is because you're mistaking the idea of a protagonist that a viewer/reader roots for as someone who is only a protagonist if they're doing the right thing.  Put another way, just because someone makes mistakes, doesn't make them not a literary hero.  Bartlet's spiral downwards as his decisions catch up with him is very much his ""descent into the underworld"".  (Hell, if we want to get Campbellian, the oppositional, catalyzing Father Figure in this abbreviated Hero's Journey is in this case literally his Father).  In a very real way, the politics of TWW are simply a structure within which we see a variety of people develop as characters through the seasons.   His change of heart at the end of Two Cathedrals is him saying as a person ""I want to do good, I can do better and I'm not going to give up simply because my past decisions weren't all that great.""   The man who lies to voters and breaks promises even to his wife is not a man who seems like he can win an election (in a fictional world, anyway), or that I even want to vote for (and they want you to want to vote for Bartlet).   This the case in the SOTU episode in season 3 (""100,000 Airplanes"").  Like you, the viewers of the speech for the first 20 minutes or so are very disapproving of the President. But...  JOEY [KENNY]  Well, something happened at the half-hour mark.  TOBY  What?  JOEY [KENNY]  They remembered why they liked him in the first place."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ProbablyNotJohnSaxon,0,Thu Mar 19 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"I don't feel there is any confusion on my end. What bothers me about this episode isn't what I think of Bartlet, it is that the writers appear to assume that right now I feel the opposite about Bartlet than I do. The moment where he puts his hands in his pockets is the beginning of his ascent out of the underworld. But, it's presented as a triumph for the American people. In this moment, with Jed at rock bottom, we should not want to reelect him. His flaws are laid bare and, as a fan of the show, I'm mad at his character. We never see that anger, though. Toby is the only member of the staff that is at all mad at Jed. (This probably plays significantly into my acceptance of Toby's leak of the military shuttle as completely within his character to do.)  Everyone else just seems concerned for his health or for the survival of the Bartlet Administration. While Jed is arguing with God, everyone else is praying for him to decide to run again. When he decides, it's a glorious moment that sustains us through to the next season. What bothers me is that this shouldn't be a glorious moment.  Your SOTU example is perfect. I need to be reminded why I liked Bartlet. Because I don't anymore. That's why his rant at God is pompous. And his flip-flopping on the decision seems so self-serving. And it is why I don't see his decision as a triumph. I don't want to reelect him, and am offended that all the characters on the show seem to feel that the American people will be much worse off with anybody at all other than Bartlet as President.  I understand the power in the drama and the dialogue of this episode. Because I do love The West Wing. But I don't love Bartlet in this moment. That's why the tone of this episode is all wrong. The tragedy isn't that we might lose him. It's that he betrayed us. He will be worthy of our love and our support, but he did this to himself. He should have to win us back. He never has to, though. We just accept that all politicians are snakes, so his betrayal is no big deal. The writers continue this idea through Ritchie. He's a boob, and this is what we get if we don't stick by the Great Man."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ObligatoryHandle,2,Thu Mar 19 21:59:09 2015 UTC,"The tragedy isn't that we might lose him. It's that he betrayed us. He will be worthy of our love and our support, but he did this to himself. He should have to win us back. He never has to, though.    I disagree with this, in the sense that just because someone disappoints you, or even betrays you, doesn't mean you won't support them or believe in them as a whole.  Intellectually, we have some distance with the character of Bartlet as a fictional character, but let's put ourselves into the shoes of one of the other characters on his staff for a moment.  By this point in the show they've been fighting with and for each other for quite a while.  They know each other's flaws and each others' strengths, but they also know that they're a team and they know that Bartlet, flawed as he is, truly wants to do good and do right by them and his country.  He didn't commit his lie of omission out of malice, he did it out of fear and trepidation.  Yes, it was wrong, but it wasn't evil (to use a dramatic term).  Also, keep in mind that within the show itself your opinion of Bartlet at that moment is not at all rare.  Everyone is skeptical of his motivations, his honesty, his appropriateness for the office... except his staff (and us as viewers, to some extent), because they know that he's a flawed man trying to do good, and they're on his team, even if he screws up now and then."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ProbablyNotJohnSaxon,0,Thu Mar 19 22:13:28 2015 UTC,"As the stakes go up, there should come a point in a relationship where loyalty is not as important as making the right choice. I feel like sometimes The West Wing has this inverted. Dumb shit that doesn't matter sometimes gets people fired, but the big lies are excused. Although, that is how real relationships work sometimes. It's good writing if it's really about the relationships, though it muddles the politics.   As for this episode specifically, Jed spends so much time talking to himself that it's hard for accept he's thinking about his relationships rather than his legacy. He rants at God because he feels he is being swept away. Mrs. Landingham wants him to do the right thing, yes, but she really wants him to want to do the right thing. Okay, you know what, the Mrs. Landingham conversations are definitely about relationships. That's about living up to his staff's ideal. But the God rant is about his feeling powerless. He should be powerless, though, because he's not living up to the ideal. In that moment, he's taking no responsibility for his actions."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ObligatoryHandle,2,Thu Mar 19 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"Aside from the ""you don't understand the West Wing"" snark, you make good points. But, I still disagree with the premise that any of this displays a nobility of character in Jed.    Oh, and as an aside, while this did come off as snarky, I don't mean it harshly.  There are definitely people who think that TWW is a show primarily about politics (and some folks who think that the GOP are always the Bad Guys(tm) and the DNC is always the Good Guys(tm) in the show).  But when you look at the series as a whole, the politics at the end drop away.  People don't remember how many years Stackhouse was in the senate, but we do remember that CJ was writing her Dad during that filibuster.  That sort of thing is what TWW is about, not the politics or the voting or whatever.  We don't care that Ainsley was for some reason working at the Hoover Institution or that Sam lost an election, we're just happy to see them back.   At the end, all the characters are still flawed, but they're also very different and richer as ""people"" than they were when they started."
thewestwing,2z2zw8,ProbablyNotJohnSaxon,0,Thu Mar 19 21:11:01 2015 UTC,"This is why I've always preferred Sports Night to The West Wing. I know it's not as good a show, but it never falls into the trap of the Great Man Theory that The West Wing and The Newsroom do. It's the same types of flawed people grappling with the same kinds of bureaucratic roadblocks, but nobody is going to die is Issac sits out this particular fight. We don't need him to give an on-air editorial about the Confederate flag flying over Luther Saks' alma mater. Nothing is going to change even if he does because he's not a very public figure to begin with, and he'd be making that commentary on a third place network even if he did. What makes it a triumph when he flip-flops is that, well, maybe something will change. Those are pretty low stakes.  The actual politics are sometimes the weakest part of the West Wing. Having the right guy on top is repeatedly made more important than actually doing the right thing. That's fine when you're dealing with both personal growth and the drama of professional relationships. But it sometimes leads Sorkin into creating a cult of personality about his protagonists. The American President, despite being far more focused on romantic melodrama, handles the reelection of Andrew Shepherd somewhat better. Even though his opponent is a despicable mudslinger, Shepherd is actually going to lose until he does the right thing politically. Whereas Bartlet is never really in danger of losing so long as he reminds everyone he's the obvious choice. His attempts to reach out to the American people are derogatorily dismissed as Uncle Fluffy by his own staff. He knows better so his mistakes don't matter."

I'm not sure why this is an example of TWW handling politics in a weak way?    It's a sad reality, but ""doing the right thing"" is not necessarily ""the right thing to do"" if you want to get elected or re-elected to public office."

thewestwing,2yoy96,Dream_Out_Loud,48,Wed Mar 11 16:38:18 2015 UTC,I think in the moment her husband being alive was the most important thing to her and she didn't want to threaten the anesthesiologist right before a life she cared about was in his hands.
thewestwing,2yoy96,RyanNormal,34,Wed Mar 11 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"And he had to know. It's never explained well I think, but the anesthesiologist has to be able to take into account medical history in determining how to treat the patient. She just wasn't interested in anything except keeping Jed alive.  It also means the anesthesiologist can't come out and say that the Bartlets lied to him, which would allow Bartlet to be impeached probably."
thewestwing,2yoy96,jckgat,14,Wed Mar 11 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. She gave him the info he needed to treat Bartlet, but didn't encourage him to keep it quiet so they can retain the fact that they had not actively covered it up."
thewestwing,2yoy96,the_colbeast,10,Wed Mar 11 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"There's also something to be said for the bluff of it all.  She's coming clean 100% to him and even though every syllable said above is spot on, there's something intrinsically human about protecting people who are completely vulnerable.  I can't imagine Dr. Lee decided he wanted to go into medicine to bring down politicians; I imagine he wants to help people.  Abby coming to him and forcefully placing their political lives, vulnerably, in his hands makes me think that there's a hint of bluff in her actions too.  She's betting that he's a human being underneath those scrubs and that he will choose to protect their vulnerability."
thewestwing,2yoy96,xicougar106,4,Thu Mar 12 03:17:02 2015 UTC,I've always thought asking these lines...also HIPPA.
thewestwing,2yoy96,snack_mac_cho,4,Thu Mar 12 12:28:26 2015 UTC,"So just now I had a thought. We don't know it at the time, but Abby is under the impression that President Bartlet is going to only serve one term, right? Now, she would have no reason to suspect that he is running for a second term because that fight isn't for another season; but what if Rosslyn was when she started shoring up insurance? She could have just told the doctor he had MS and nothing else. She's a doctor, she understands HIPA. And I think congress compelling an emergency physician to testify about a gunshot trauma victim's MS in a historical context wouldn't be likely (again, obviously, when it comes out).   I think she wanted him to resign that night. MS is one thing, assassination attempts are a whole different set of circumstances for their arrangement to exist under. So she plants the idea in the doctors head with a middling statement; she essentially tells the doctor that she has no interest in keeping the secret, just that she won't be the one to breach it. She's still in control enough to keep her head, but definitely shaken enough to justify making that decision for the President."
thewestwing,2yoy96,TragedyInMotion,6,Wed Mar 11 22:38:04 2015 UTC,Great point.
thewestwing,2yoy96,GodspeakerVortka,9,Wed Mar 11 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"Abbey thought it wouldn't matter about the MS disclosure at that point since he wasn't going to run for a second term anyway.   ""We had a deal"" for one term."
thewestwing,2yoy96,jbrswm,2,Wed Mar 11 20:41:13 2015 UTC,Which never made sense to me since the big thing about Jed not wanting to be a one term president! Remember? Leo and him shouting at each other over how the staff couldn't get stuff done as they were being held back as he didn't want to piss people off and be a one term president.
thewestwing,2yoy96,jamiestewart48,3,Thu Mar 12 05:40:23 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps Jed simply lied/misled Abbey from the start, he said to her what he needed to in order to get her on board with a run for the White House, he's either lying to Abbey or the staff (and maybe to some extent himself)"
thewestwing,2yoy96,tc1991,2,Thu Mar 12 09:00:20 2015 UTC,I've thought this too. Abbey was going to have to be sold on a second term. It would be easier to try and talk her into it once he was in the middle of his first term and making some progress.   I don't think Jed nor Leo got into it thinking it would be one term only.
thewestwing,2yoy96,jbrswm,17,Thu Mar 12 17:47:22 2015 UTC,You are going to see it later but its for legal and PR purposes.

thewestwing,2yoy96,TribeFan11,3,Wed Mar 11 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"this is my argument.  she didn't need to ""allow"" him to say anything because it's already protected (i would think) my DPC.  obviously she's not the patient but he's incapacitated and she's his wife.  i would imagine the information is protected.  i understand the concerns centering on making sure his life is saved.  i just don't think she needs to even address this (or threaten him) because it would be obvious he can't say those things."
thewestwing,2yoy96,ObligatoryHandle,7,Wed Mar 11 19:23:03 2015 UTC,"Doctor patient confidentiality is far, far less strong than attorney-client or even that with a spiritual advisor from a leak perspective, just because of the sheer number of people with whom the information has to be shared. Any number of doctors and nurses who walk in the room can see charts, folks in billing see documents explaining prescriptions and doses, and any number of people working for an insurance company could do so as well when they are sent billing information. Any leaker could pretty easily deny being the person responsible due to the sheer number of people who have access to the information if he placed it in the chart as he was technically supposed to."
thewestwing,2yoy96,valeriekeefe,2,Wed Mar 11 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"It turns the non-threat by Abby into actually a bit of a threat, doesn't it?

It sounds like writing. Because the writers are doing extra work with this one exchange. They want to plant seeds for the legal difficulties Abby and Jed are to face.

No matter what permutation comes up, there was only a 1:1,000,000 chance of that specific permutation coming up.  A slightly more fun example is The Drake Equation which puts the number of intelligent civilizations in the universe in the billions even with the most conservative estimate.  Enough rolls of any die will result in a nearly uncountable number of immeasurably rare results.  edit: permutation, not combination."

thewestwing,2yau64,Bartlet-is-president,8,Sun Mar 8 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it even more kindly, as Joe reassuring Josh that even his political enemies didn't think he was some hair-trigger violent crazy person.  What strikes me as odd about that line, though, is that Joe and the other Republicans know about the PTSD at all. The only ones who knew were Josh, Stanley, Donna, Leo, and Bartlet, and I can't see any of them going out of their way to spread the story around."
thewestwing,2yau64,AbusingSarcasm,3,Sun Mar 8 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"very true, that is strange that the republicans know when in ""noel"" they all seem to try to keep it very hush hush"
thewestwing,2yau64,skywaterblue,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's in Donna's diary, presumably."
thewestwing,2yau64,WalterSkinnerFBI,4,Sat Mar 21 03:01:13 2015 UTC,I've long questioned this and I have yet to hear someone explain it that doesn't sound just as circular as the line itself. Including here.
thewestwing,2yau64,ObligatoryHandle,2,Fri Mar 13 02:56:39 2015 UTC,"I never understood that line, either. It doesn't make sense why Joe would know about the PTSD story, why he would flippantly dismiss the story in a job interview, or why he would feel it necessary to reassure Josh that the deniers don't matter. They took what Josh said, which was a very out-there non-sequitor that Joe should have not understood at all and ignored, and made Joe respond with something that made us Josh (and us) get glassy-eyed over.   I suppose the idea is to keep Josh in character and on the offensive when dealing with an ""enemy"" Republican lawyer. It's a very Josh quip, mean and sort of funny and obsessed with winning. Meanwhile, it makes Joe appear conscious of his opposition position in this White House, but also making him sympathetic to the viewers by empathizing with Josh. The writers are doing a lot of work with the exchange. The problem is that I've always found this exchange to be a grievous violation of Elmore Leonard's #1 rule for writing dialog: if it sounds like writing, re-write it."
thewestwing,2yau64,NewMerril,2,Wed Mar 11 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"I think you may have misunderstood it. Or maybe I have? Regardless, I don't think it's dickish at all. Here's my interpretation:  He is referring to Josh's PTSD. When Joe says ""the people that I talk to"" he's referring to fellow Republicans; when he says ""the people that you'd like"" he's referring to Josh's friends.  Josh's enemies (the Republicans) don't believe the story that Josh is genuinely suffering from PTSD. They think that he's making it up or exaggerating it to get sympathy for himself and/or the president.   Josh's friends believe the story, but they don't think less of Josh because of it. They don't care about his PTSD in the sense that they don't think of him as being defective because of it."
thewestwing,2yau64,NewMerril,5,Sun Mar 8 04:04:24 2015 UTC,"i get how it could seem that Josh's ""friends"" don't look down on him because of it. but i still find it strange for him to tell josh that some people don't believe him or think he's a liar. i mean who says that to a person with a mental illness?"
thewestwing,2yau64,Kardlonoc,3,Sun Mar 8 08:25:30 2015 UTC,"As someone who suffers from depression, I can tell you that mental illness has a incredibly negative stigma. People often think that you're making it up.  For example, we all feel sad or stressed or anxious at times. So the tendency is to think that any mental illness related to those is just someone taking advantage of those feelings for some personal gain. I mean, all sorts of people believe that actual things like that don't exist. It's a real problem."
thewestwing,2yau64,SixTaterTots,2,Sun Mar 8 08:36:28 2015 UTC,"People forget Josh got shot in the fucking chest. I think even Josh forgot.   But in the poltical field Josh is like Hercules, or some insane greek hero. There is little room for sympathy for a man who that good at his job from the opposition."

The only thing that bothers me is Charlie's reaction when he gets the phone call. It always seems too deadpan. I chalk it up to shock, but it just never seems to resonate with the rest of the episode.  But Bartlett's rant in the cathedral, his ""conversation"" in the Oval Office, and Leo's ""Watch This"" as he puts his hands in his pockets always get to me. The slow build is incredible.  The look of confusion on the janitors face when he finds the cigarette and Josh's description of ""Option B"" are two of the more underrated moments as well.  ""Or do you think that's too on the nose?""  ""I do."""

thewestwing,2y40i6,Wolfish_Jew,5,Sat Mar 7 03:04:10 2015 UTC,Yeah. It always made me sad. I thought he had excellent chemistry with Sheen and I really liked him on the show. But the more serious emotional moments seemed to be slightly out of his reach
thewestwing,2y40i6,Wolfish_Jew,2,Fri Mar 6 09:00:04 2015 UTC,I think that maybe it was a choice either by him or by Schlamme. Because he opened up a few times very effectively. This scene comes to mind: http://youtu.be/SHQrOz8wkEA
thewestwing,2y40i6,MisterWonka,2,Fri Mar 6 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"You may be totally right, because he's also excellent during the scene when Bartlett gives him the knife. But if that is a choice, it's an odd one. It just doesn't seem to fit with everything else. It jars me every time I see it. Like ""Gee, this woman that he's worked so closely with and that means so much to the president just died"" but he tells Leo like the Swedish ambassador just canceled his meeting with the president. Especially in a show that, in the first few seasons at least, seems so built around everyone caring for and sticking up for each other."
thewestwing,2y40i6,Wolfish_Jew,5,Sat Mar 7 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree it's jarring. But it's also jarring when he's told about the president being shot because of him and Zoey and he just says okay. I think he's been through so much trauma and hardship he has his guard up always. He's had to be strong for his sister for so long, and diligent about work and school, he's somewhat robotic when he's in that mode."
thewestwing,2y40i6,MisterWonka,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"If you've watched the entire series, there are plenty of moments where Charlie says little more than a few ""okay""s.   For example, when Ron Butterfield says ""the President wasn't the target"", and when Josh explains what it means when Kundunese are 'swapping families'."
thewestwing,2y40i6,pdmcmahon,3,Sat Mar 7 07:35:50 2015 UTC,"The first two times I watched it, when President Bartlett curses god in Latin I thought it got a little hokey (calm down Sorkin, ya know?). Who just lapses into Latin?? But I recently rewatched and man, I guess I wasn't seeing it how it was meant to be seen, because I cried. Very powerful stuff!"
thewestwing,2y40i6,CoffeeCandle,3,Fri Mar 6 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"So I'll throw something out there that I feel goes underappreciated in the finale of Season 2 - how good the actress who plays young Mrs. Landingham is.   People are cast to play young versions of older characters all the time, and mostly it takes some willing suspension of disbelief for it to work. But that actress had Mrs. Landingham's voice and demeanor down pat, to the point that I wondered if she wasn't the actress who plays Mrs. Landingham's real life daughter or niece or something. Kudos to both the casting director and the actress."
thewestwing,2y40i6,Limin8tor,0,Sat Mar 7 01:37:42 2015 UTC,GODDAMNIT! I'm only a few episodes before that and I had no idea that she died. Massive spoiler.

thewestwing,2xx0mh,Limin8tor,3,Wed Mar 4 15:56:27 2015 UTC,Great parallel between TWW and Star Trek TNG. Still not a fan of seasons 5-7 when compared to 1-4.
thewestwing,2xx0mh,barryfc,2,Wed Mar 4 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"The author referred to Bingo Bob as ""interesting"". He totally lost me there."
thewestwing,2xx0mh,trevelyan76,3,Wed Mar 4 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's clearly not dynamic, but Toby and Will think he's going to be a pushover, or worse, a millstone, and he at least throws some monkey wrenches into their plans.  If nothing else the Bartlet staff underestimates him, and that alone, plus him luring Will over, makes him pretty interesting in the story."
thewestwing,2xx0mh,Hurrishane2283,4,Thu Mar 5 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"I just finished rewatching season 5 last night (coincidentally). While I didn't mind so much the characters starting to butt heads, my biggest complaint is the lack of a running narrative. There was no MS scandal, no election, nothing to tie the episodes together except the passage of time. Even big events that would have taken up months of news cycles, only lasted a couple of episodes. Walken taking over, supreme court nominees (Mendosa's story was at least 3-4 episodes, they got 2 nominees in one day), the government shutdown was all but forgotten after 2 episodes, no backlash, no recovery efforts.  This show lived on its ongoing narrative, telling one involved story while having ""simpler"" events happen around it. The lack of any long-running events dragged down season 5 (in my mind)"
thewestwing,2xx0mh,Hilfandor,5,Wed Mar 4 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"West Wing (at least under Sorkin) was always more episodic than it was serial. Yeah, you'd have some continuing stories floating around in the background, but they were pretty much picked up and dropped at will, and occasionally remembered when it was convenient. Don't get me wrong - I like that about it. It's neat being able to pop in a random episode and enjoy it as a standalone thing, but it was always a show about big stories, not big story arcs."
thewestwing,2xx0mh,Hurrishane2283,0,Thu Mar 5 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Season 5 has more running narrative than the 4 previous seasons.   New speaker and his budget and the White House wanting to still make tuition deductible all encompass the first I wanna say 8 episodes of the season.   I know there's more but I can't remember specifics right now, but watching thru season 5 the second time around it actually felt like an entire story where the previous seasons were just collections of stories."
thewestwing,2xx0mh,munchypooh,0,Thu Mar 5 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"I liked the genuine interpersonal tension that went beyond accusations of “Uncle Fluffy.”    Wait, what?

Yeah, no, they fought and they fought hard."

thewestwing,2xvtph,fuckety_byebye,3,Wed Mar 4 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"There are small allusions to it. Leo talking with a lawyer who describes him as an anchor for the campaign. And before confessing, Toby spoke with the president and he mentioned the campaign would never survive this situation. Nothing definite obviously, but enough for my headcannon."
thewestwing,2xvtph,ObligatoryHandle,2,Wed Mar 4 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"This is the same Toby who had no problem walking into the Oval Office and telling the President ""Your dad hated you and would hit you because you were smarter than he was"" because the president gave a subpar speech. There's no way he leaks this story without addressing the matter with the President 1st."
thewestwing,2xvtph,valeriekeefe,7,Wed Mar 4 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"The President who lied to the American people and his staff about MS, and then assassinating a foreign diplomat? At some point, Toby is just going to decide that the President is a liar and the people need to know. This being a space issue soon after his astronaut brother dies I feel increases Toby's rashness and also his his conviction in its rightness to tell the people. It's an extreme, but still within his character."
thewestwing,2xvtph,RainbowTrain,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"There's no way he leaks this story without addressing the matter with the President 1st.    That is indeed my version of events.  President Bartlet needed to bounce himself into sending up the Military Shuttle. The President of the United States cannot reveal the classified asset which he does by using it. Someone else needed to reveal it.  The poor white house handling of the leak, the anger from the President at Toby deciding to fall on this grenade unilaterally, the way he has to exasperatedly, and with a bit of pain, explain that he has to fire Toby... for cause.  Oh, and the way Oliver Babbish thanked him for his service."
thewestwing,2xvtph,harmless-error,7,Wed Mar 4 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"I actually like this idea. I just finished re-watching Season 2 Episode 18, when Toby first learns about MS. What strikes me most is how unconcerned he is for the President, but rather for the party as a whole. He even goes so far as to say Hoynes was right to leave the breadcrumb trail. So all in all I'd say that this supposition is equally, if not more possible as Toby taking the fall for CJ."
thewestwing,2xvtph,jbrswm,7,Thu Mar 12 10:35:34 2015 UTC,I think we need to stop second-guessing this. Toby was being selfish and setting his own judgment ahead of everyone else's. He said he did it. He obviously had strong feelings about it because of his brother.
thewestwing,2xvtph,d0mth0ma5,5,Wed Mar 4 08:54:07 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you on this. All we know is what we saw and we saw him confess.   If he is covering for CJ, his confession to her would make zero sense."
thewestwing,2xvtph,felixht,4,Wed Mar 4 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"Also CJ telling Greg Brock to ""name his source""."
thewestwing,2xvtph,WhovianMoak,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"I used to think he was covering for CJ in the sense that he didn't know about it prior to CJ bringing it up (although vaguely), in the sense where he didnt have clearance. CJ, not thinking Toby would be a source, looks for the leak, and her reaction to his confession is just because she doesnt want to incriminate anyone.   Upon more thinking though, I think it's just a poorly written storyline and I definitely found it to be completely unfair to Toby's character on the show. Toby has shit luck throughout the series, I think he/Richard Schiff deserved a better sendoff, or at least more space in the episodes than the occasional call to Josh and CJ's one visit which isnt the most cordial."
thewestwing,2xvtph,AnnualReminder,4,Sun Mar 8 09:22:58 2015 UTC,"I remember on my first watchthrough being absolutely positive that Toby was taking the fall for someone else. But on subsequent re-watches I have come to the decision that he was definitely the leak, and he was doing so to honor the memory of his brother. I actually feel that it fits his character as he and Josh were always the ones that advocated for saving each human life, regardless of the fallout."
thewestwing,2xvtph,Beauregard_Nanners,2,Mon Mar 16 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"I happen to be re-watching now, and just got to 7.5. I'm starting to think OP's theory is right in that Toby took the fall for the benefit of the party. I also believe Toby isn't knowingly covering for a specific person- he dove on the grenade without knowing or caring who pulled the pin. His answers to Babish's questions come across as Toby wanting nobody else touched by this.   Here's the part where I may be way away from the pack. I think Margaret was the real leak."
thewestwing,2xvtph,gzpz,4,Wed Mar 4 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"A buddy of mine once postulated that in some off-screen scene, Bartlet called Toby in and said ""I gotta leak this"" and toby said ""I gotta take the fall - this can't come from you, but the democratic party/bartlet white house/santos campaign can survive me leaving in disgrace""  It makes more sense in that Toby would never betray Bartlet - argue, disagree, yell at, but never betray. Toby's personality couldn't have shifted that much from the death of his brother, and even if he had leaked it out of anger/stress/moment of unclarity he'd probably fess up and apologize to Bartlet.  Additionally, Bartlet is probably one of the few people Toby would do this for. He's an incredibly smart man and knows what this leak could do to his life (jail, alienation, what-have-you), and would be extremely wary of covering for most people. Bartlet, however, is not most people - Toby already views him as superior in pretty much every way and believes at his core that the nation/world absolutely needs him to be in power...  All this headcannon needs to be able to work is the thought that all Jed's actions regarding Toby after that point were amazingly good acting to prevent any other senior staffer from getting in trouble..."

thewestwing,2xx1ts,Ambi0us,7,Wed Mar 4 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason the House of Cards scene rings so hollow is the fact that, despite it being a very obvious West Wing reference, it doesn't recognize what made Bartlett's rant so dramatic. Bartlett was an incredibly devout Catholic who was going through a really intense period of religious and personal turmoil. The fact that this man who is so devout that he almost became a priest made this profound show of disrespect towards God show just how deep his personal struggles run. Underwood, on the other hand, was really just being a prick. It is a show of disrespect, but it doesn't mean anything for Underwood's character."

I grew up watching it with my mom and a lot of what they said resonated with me, but most of all I loved the naive belief that people in Washington really wanted to represent the people, and not their own pocket books. I think that was one of the most painful lessons I learned when I got older. I remember when people made comparisons between Matt Santos and Barack Obama. A youthful, energetic minority democrat coming in to shake up the system. I voted for him twice. The first time because I believed in him, and the second, because Romney was the opposite of the ideals I held.

The opening scene includes him talking about the historic heirloom gavel he inherited and how its a treasured possession.  He also makes casual conversation regarding a voice recorder with the pesky ability to occasionally not stop recording.    A few scenes later, after some time has passed, Bartlett enters his office with Leo and they float a hypothetical situation in which the President and 16 others have conspired to commit a fraud against the US people, asking Babbash's opinion on how to proceed.   Babbash's first reaction is to smash the recorder with the gavel into a pieces and the scene ends.  Just the overall storyline, including the break between the scenes to make it seem like the discussions were mere background talk, was just really funny."

What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff Leo McGarry insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here’s one that’s really important because we’ve got a lot of sports fans in this town: touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean. Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? Can West Point?

What a waste, right?  The key point he misses is what actually makes inside-baseball and scandal more interesting than message and plans: it's that one deals with humans and humanity, and the other doesn't.  That was the brilliance of ""The West Wing"" anyway: it took a playing field considered taboo for its dryness and complexity, and turned it into something relatable. Did they win? Sure, but they also lost. They also struggled, they also cried. But you rooted for them because of their humanity. You saw their character instead of the scripted stumps you see on the campaign trail. ...You saw 2004 Obama instead of 2010 Obama. It's character.   That's why storytellers like Sorkin, and any speechwriter who knows what they're doing need to value narrative, and emotion, and these very biological triggers that engage us to what might look dry, but truly be the difference between life and death.

He tries to make it more, although I guess to many of us it was. I can safely say that the West Wing has shaped my political views as much or more than anything else. I'm not sure if I'm an anomaly but I was 12 years old when I first started watching (I don't know, seems kinda young to be embracing this show in retrospect), so I was coming at things with a highly impressionable mind. I'm not sure if being formed such a way by a television show is a good thing or a bad thing, but it's important to recognize that if I want to ever take my political views seriously. I have to reflect more on this, but I'm caught between ""we can't blame the West Wing for being a TV show"" and understanding that for me it was much more than that."
thewestwing,2xbynt,Mediaright,2,Fri Feb 27 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah! I was 10. No kidding, I was behind the couch organizing Pokemon cards when my folks were watching the previous night's episode on VCR: ""You drive me to the political safe-ground, that's not true."" ""I know it's not true... YOU DRIVE ME THERE."" Cue the air being sucked out of the room and me whipping my head around. ""...What the hell did you just say?"" ""And you know it too...We're stuck in neutral because""  And with that one sequence, I was absolutely hooked. Guess what? I was absolutely impressionable. You know what goes well together? Kids and idealism. Whodda thunk it, right? And I know I didn't fully understand or appreciate what was happening. When ""Isaac and Ismael"" first aired, I went, ""Who thought this was a good idea? What the hell is this?"" Of course, now I know all too well the cultural artifact and salve it represents.  My bubble was burst along the way, which I think was healthy. Bush being a moron didn't help. After Kerry lost, I buried myself deep in tech. And after Obama won, and the tone of DC seemed completely unchanged, I bagged out of politics again. You realize a few things:   Watching TWW is like watching a star. You're seeing a distorted picture of what politics looked like over 15 years ago. It's a very Clintonian show and things have changed. That's fine though. People just have to be mindful of that. I'm fine with it being idealistic and romantic. It gives me faith. I know so many people who are not even 21 yet, and are absolutely horrible cynics. They'd take their own lives if it was more culturally acceptable. To them, society is completely lost beyond saving. And of course then there's me trying to find silver linings and being optimistic about things. I stick out like a sore thumb, but I'm ok with that.   They say entrepreneurs are successful because they have vision. They see what things ""could"" be. I'm have no illusions about modern politics, but I keep a generally positive outlook because I've seen ""the dream scenario."" Will that ever be? Maybe not, but if we don't strive towards parts of it, what's guiding us anyway? Tables and charts? I don't think so.  PS. I also wonder if we're not weary of TWW's view of politics, but simply of watching a democrat we thought would be a fighter turn out to be a philosophical centrist who doesn't like mud-fights (rightly so but you gotta deal), who's been eaten alive by the system. It's not fun to watch. Nobody would blame you for cynicism, but blaming TWW for giving you hope seems stupid to me."
thewestwing,2xbynt,RuafaolGaiscioch,2,Fri Feb 27 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Pokemon and the West Wing, 1999 was a very good year.   And I think you hit in your first comment about ""Oh wow, Santa isn't real. What's your point?"" It's irrational, and I'm sure we both recognized this as children, to expect that our political leaders' actions and intent reflect that which is portrayed in a television show. I think for the guy who wrote this, he pretty much dismisses the entire show because he came to very unsurprising realization that it's fantasy, when there are still lessons we can draw from the show besides ""seeing how the sausage is made."" It's one thing to blindly agree with the characters' positions or believe that it's more reality than fiction, but I'm forever grateful that the show instilled within me the belief (and to paraphrase) that a few well-intentioned individuals working together can actually make a difference. He oddly compares the West Wing to FNL in his conclusion, but I think he missed that larger theme of the show, which was never for me ""agree with my liberalism."" The passion of these characters always inspired me more than their political views ever did."

I think, as you said, it throws the rhythm of the season off, which is partially true. That said, it's a glimpse into CJ's life away from work and, to an extent, us as an audience. That's fascinating to me because we rarely jump too deeply into these peoples' lives beyond their jobs, such as it exists."

And I don't mean the teasers, I mean as if they were answering separate things.  I like the concept, they just didn't make it work right. I'm even fine with the fact that it's so different. They just blew the chance."

More than any time in recent history, America's destiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil.

thewestwing,2wi9ru,SamSez,2,Fri Feb 20 14:09:37 2015 UTC,"That line kind of bothered me, actually.  Bartlett is shown on many other occasions to be a devout and well-read Catholic, and also a stickler for accuracy and terminology in his speeches.  According to Catholic tradition, Angels are not former humans, but an entirely separate race of divine beings (incidentally, Angels also don't have souls, since God only gave souls to humans).  The implication that the students killed running into the fire to save victims of the bombing have become Angels is incorrect, and it strikes me as out of character for Bartlett to let something like that pass."

There is no promise it will get picked up to series (we'll find out in May if it will). He's just been cast in a random pilot. He also starred in NBC pilot ""The Pro"" last pilot season and it wasn't picked up.  In fact, the odds are stacked against a pickup for this show. FOX will likely only pick up one to two comedies. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has already been picked up and will probably stay on Sundays. New Girl will get a fifth season that will probably be the final. Mindy has horrible ratings, but with a full third season this year, the syndication gods demand a full fourth season.  All this is to say, if this Rob Lowe series gets a pickup, it will likely be for a short six episode order midseason. And those always do well. /sarcasm  Or it could be an inspired pilot.

I think the biggest issue facing Americans right now is the same issue that it has been for decades, if not longer: education; the silver bullet.  In America, a decent education comes at a high premium. I know first hand that a public school education will get you far; some of the most successful people I know attended public high school and state universities. I went to a public high school (then private university) myself and consider myself successful for my age.  But schools should be better, and it should be cheaper, if it cannot be free to send someone to college. It is embarrassing how low the United States ranks on education of the world.  If you want real progress made and an improvement of the quality of living, if you want people to care about the real issues that our government faces, you need to educate the minds responsible for it first.

thewestwing,2vggfs,Rynoh,11,Tue Feb 10 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"If it was up to me i'd like to see a situation where We are 8 or 12 years later, I think the story line would go where Santos either lost when running for a second term or for whatever reason decided to step down and not run for a 2nd term.  This would allow for Josh and Donna to take a break and make some money in the private sector and Sam to end up either becoming a congressman for a year or two or just immediately becoming a senator.  We are coming off a period of time where Walken could of decided to run 4 years later and is either coming off a 4 or 8 year Republican run.    I'd have the story pickup with Sam becoming president and being sworn in, I'd use flashbacks in season 1 to show the campaign and allow for Goodman to be a strong guest throughtout season 1 in the flashbacks."
thewestwing,2vggfs,sobusyimbored,2,Tue Feb 10 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"Sam becoming president is just unrealistic.  Personally I'd see Santos serve 8 years and be leaving office an unpopular POTUS. Sam (or another protagonist who recruits Sam) leaves the White House to run someone against a strong GOP candidate.   The Ritchie race was entertaining only because of the incompetence of Ritchie, but it was boring because we knew he could never win. Vinick on the other hand should have won so a competent opponent would be best.  Josh would be an elder but too much a cautionary tale to get Sam to follow his immediate tracks."
thewestwing,2vggfs,amishius,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:53:25 2015 UTC,"You bring up an interesting point here as I re-enter the 2002 campaign on my rewatch: there's all this STRESS about reelection but it  fizzles so quickly. Ritchie is easily handled and it seems most of the stress and tension only exists for the folks we're watching. It's kind of a letdown...not that I won't continue with the rewatch, of course."

thewestwing,2vggfs,Willravel,7,Wed Feb 11 20:33:18 2015 UTC,"In addition to Josh, Donna, and Charlie, they could bring back Rob Lowe's Sam Seaborn (and stop him from making those awful cable commercials), John Malina's Will Bailey (Scandal likely doesn't keep him super busy), Mary McCormack's Kate Harper, Kristin Chenoweth's Annabeth Schott, Timothy Busfield's Danny Concannon, Mary-Louise Parker's Amy Gardener, Anna Deavere Smith's Nancy McNally, and a few others."

thewestwing,2vggfs,ZebZ,2,Wed Feb 11 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"you could easily have Ainsley play a role in the cabinet as well.  Her back story would be soemthing like left council's office for position with republican party, went to work with high powered Republican Senator or whatever during Santos Terms and swung it into some kind of deputy position for a cabinet member under a republic president and now she is ready to serve in the cabinet under Sam's presidency.  I'm cretain Sam would want an opposition view point that wasn't going to back down from challenging him."
thewestwing,2vggfs,Swaddels,3,Wed Feb 11 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"Since this is a few days old, I doubt anyone will see this, but...  Eric Baker is a first term president, succeeding Santos.  Sam is his VP.  Amy Gardner as Chief of Staff.  Charlie as Deputy Chief of Staff.  (Josh was 38 when the show started, Charlie would be 37.)  Josh as head of the DNC.  Donna as head of some lobbying group.  They basically make some cameos.  Plot twist!  President Baker forced to resign or assassinated midway through the first season, Sam ascends to President.  Sam's new VP?  Oregon governor and former 3-term Congressmen Will Bailey.   Accompanying VP Bailey to Washington?  His lovely wife, Joey Lucas-Bailey whom he fell in love with while she was his campaign manager."

Will as communications director? Charlie as deputy Chief of Staff?  Could fit C.J. in as an ambassador, since she took off for Africa after the show ended.  It would be more along the lines of a Cameo than a running part tho.   After the show's ending, IDK what they'll do for Tobi"
thewestwing,2vggfs,AbusingSarcasm,-1,Wed Feb 11 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"I think Josh would be chief of staff after having learned serving in the same role for Santos.  Donna i think would have more of a Mandy role, someone who is a consultant and not a permanent position as i imagine her and Josh having atarted a family together.  Charlie would be a good deputy chief of staff.  I think you could bring Margaret back as the presidents secretary.  I really like CJ as an ambassador to an important partner like the U.K.  Will would make a good communications director.  I think i would bring in new blood for press secretary although it would need to be a woman to offset a male heavy cast.  I know they never had a relationship on the show but i think it would be fun to bring back Amy Gardner as first lady, see what a first lady with her own strong agenda can do.    As for Toby you just forget about him, he can't be trusted on the show but could maybe get a cameo occasionaly as someone contracted to help write important speeches but he could never have any official role."
thewestwing,2vggfs,trevelyan76,2,Wed Feb 11 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"Amy as first lady?  what about Leo's daughter Malorie? As a teacher, being focused on education would be very traditional agenda for a first lady.  I almost want to see a bachelor president, since they are rare to say the least."

thewestwing,2ujuk7,Niclisten,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry you got downvoted, I think it's a valid question.  And truth is, no, I never really grew to like her until the very end (and even then, found her to be expendable as a character).  I felt like it was established - when she applied/interviewed for the job - that she was not qualified.  And I think the fact that she was never actually hired for the Press Secretary position (and that Toby was left to take it over) was a cop-out.  I think the weakest part of this whole segment of the series is that the core of the west wing staff, the most important staff in the US, arguably, was reduced essentially to CJ and Toby.  And here's this new character in Anna Beth, who only seems to be a ""makeup artist/PR assistant"" for Toby, who never should have served as PS in the first place.

I think it's more poking fun at silly traditions than taking a real swing at the education system, though.  And, theoretically, it is actually possible for a President to pardon a non-human under Article II, Section 2.  The relevant potion reads:   ...and [the President] shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.   Nowhere in there does it limit the power to pardon to citizens, nationals, or any other conceivable stand-in for the word ""human.""  And the Supreme Court says that the United States is not limited to charging humans for offenses.  See here.  --  Now I realize that this precedent was set after this particular episode aired, but legally speaking, should the turkey in question have been charged and convicted of some offense against the federal government, the President most certainly may pardon it.  Now, Bartlett, in his defense, does bring up the fact that the turkey in question had not committed a crime, but he erred in suggesting that it would be impossible to pardon a turkey, categorically."

If your chief of staff completely disagrees with you and makes it very vocal, it's tough to keep him around. Leo is still Jed's best friend but after so many years in office Jed doesn't need him like he did early on.  Also, CJ was the right choice. Josh had too many enemies and Toby  wasn't diplomatic enough either. CJ was in no way the""clueless"" one like someone said.

It was always funny that people say Sorkin can't write strong women yet CJ was one of the strongest female characters I've ever seen on TV.  I've always felt that the only way we could have potentially had a better storyline was if Jed hired an outside, new cast member for the job for a 3 episode arc and they didn't mesh well with the staff ultimately leading up to a blow up where Jed fires him/her and then makes the right call with CJ.

Besides, in the Bartlett Administration Josh always felt too immature and/or pigeonholed. He's great but I just couldn't picture him as Bartlett's CoS. (Yeah, I went there with abbreviations!)  Sam obviously couldn't do it since he's out somewhere presumably not being a Congressman. Besides, he's way too young and inexperienced.  Will Bailey couldn't do it. Again, way too young and inexperienced.   Toby couldn't do it because he's more of a behind-the-scenes guy. I simply could not picture him being an effective administrator on that level in any way. And the whole compromising and prioritizing? I don't think he could ever be the guy for that. Besides, he's got the whole ""who leaked the info"" plotline coming up that season.  Besides all the reasons against other people, CJ would be a good choice! Sure, someone more experienced would probably be better. But she's been Press Secretary for 6 (?) years already and she's intimately familiar with pretty much all parts of the Administration. She's smart, she's not afraid to speak her mind, she has relationships already. Perhaps they aren't as matured as a Dick Cheney or something, by a long shot, but to bastardize Cheney himself: you make the show with the characters you have, not the characters you might want or wish to have at a later time.   And it makes good TV; it's a way to refresh one of the characters into a new role with new challenges while allowing her to still be one of the main cast. Plus now all the characters get to tweak their relationship with her which provides new(ish) material.  BTW I was trying to recall what episode was CJ's first day as CoS and ran across this thread from 11 months ago asking the exact same question.

thewestwing,2u9fdy,jjfrantik,5,Sat Jan 31 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"Well for one, CJ gets a way overinflated role in the show for a press secretary. I like her character still, but by this point I've come to accept that CJ's involvement as such an influential member of the administration is basically unrealistic filler to make a more interesting story. In fact, I like CJ the best when she's getting told off by Toby or Leo, and even Sam once in Season 1 or 2.  Basically it comes down to sacrificing realism for the sake of storytelling. Is CJ the most qualified? No. Does choosing CJ provide relatively efficient plot development? Absolutely. It leaves Josh and Will free to run their respective campaigns and Toby to keep his role in Season 7, y'know... with spoilers and stuff. Also, nobody from outside the administration would make sense, either logically or for storytelling purposes (hello, Angela Blake)."

This is one of my big gripes minus the fact leo changed so much is that someone else should have come in if they decided to switch chief of staffs.   I think CJ is an absurdly bad choice she is constantly kept out of the loop and has shown a tendency to overreact in the show. Never liked this decision at all.

thewestwing,2u9fdy,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"I remember answering this in the other thread asking this. Short answer: of all the senior staff, she's the only solid choice.    Josh is a political beast, his strength is knowing when to lean on whom and use his muscle behind the scenes. There are dozens of times during the show where Josh is too impulsive, doesn't see the big picture and shows definite weak characteristics that a Chief Of Staff would need to be strong in. Toby is too... Toby. He's an exceptional mind, but a COS needs to make the kinds of decisions in the situation room that requires a cool head and lots of pragmatism. Toby flips his lid ALOT and is too emotional. he is also terrible at handling staff. A COS also needs to be able to diplomatically weave and handle the different military advisors like Nancy and Hutchinson. Will is nowhere near senior enough to be able to hold his own as COS of the President, not enough experience, and also he is in many ways very similar to Josh.   Who does that leave?   C.J, on the other hand, challenges Leo's and Bartlet's decisions many times, dares to speak out her differing views and defend her ideals, even when the rest of the staff and Bartlett seem to be in agreement. She is, in many ways, the show's ""conscience."" Her idealism, her high expectations of herself AND of her fellow staff makes her the most obvious candidate. The pressure she has been under and the attention she has had to handle as PS is also unique to the other senior staff.  I think Leo wrote only one name very early on, and that name was C.J. Her development in her role as PS and as a part of the senior staff makes me think that Leo has bet on her taking over for him for a long time.  In my mind, C.J. is probably the best written female character for any TV-show, EVER. Of all the characters on the show, hers is the most explored. We get to know her relationship with her father, we get to see where she grew up, her romantic life, her loss, her background before the West Wing, and also her growth into Chief Of Staff. She's utterly brilliant, goofy, vulnerable and witty, and she seems to be written and concieved of with so much love by Sorkin and the other writers."

Then I'll cry a wittul bit, because I'm a man and that shit was heartbreaking, I'll laugh at the Fahrenheit 451 joke, gasp at the ensuing smack, admire young Bartlett's tenacity and passion, forgive myself for not appreciating Dolores like I did the first time I ran through the series, even though I've appreciated her to the fullest ever since, and in the church...  My mouth, it will drop totally agape as Martin Sheen's prowess and range fills my television screen, the towering empty walls echoing raw emotion conveyed only by tone, not by voice. President Bartlett's sheer arrogance in that, the most breathtakingly brazen scene ever aired on television, it will cement him, to me, as the most admirable character ever created.  I won't learn the Latin, no, because I'm not supposed to. Learning the Latin would go against everything I hold sacred about that episode, even if I'd like nothing more than to repeat it verbatim the next time I rewatch season two. I won't do it, I won't, because I want to experience Two Cathedrals at its fullest every time I watch it, and that means genuine shock during what can only be described as the dopest monologue ever.  I'll wait to watch it, yeah. It'll be better that way. It'll be better to plan my night around it, to make sure my environment is completely stable, to give myself the highest chance of total viewing pleasure...

The story telling mechanism of the staff writing letters to home is just perfect. Plus, we get Winnie! I must say that whoever came up with the idea of the imagery of Toby bouncing the ball at the end of that episode and then the transition to the start of 17 People is brilliant. May have been Sorkin but I think Schlamme's also the type of person who would think of something like this.   I watched the cold open to 17 People before I turned it off. Best cold open of the series in my opinion. The end where Leo realizes that Toby knows something is up and you have the image of the two of them staring at each other and the sound of the ""thadump"" in the background. Chills.  Stopped there. Personal opinion, but while most of the series can be watched one episode at a time you absolutely must watch 17 People, Bad Moon Rising, 18th & Potomac, and Two Cathedrals in one sitting. It's absolutely worth the three hours to watch all four of them back to back. For the life of me I don't understand how someone could watch one episode of those four and then stop.  As bad as it sucks to lose Mrs. Landingham - it gives us four of the biggest ""Oh shit yes!"" moments of the series - 1) Jeb's speech to God in the cathedral, 2) Jeb and Mrs. Landingham's ""ghost"" in the Oval, 3) Brothers In Arms, 4) The Mrs. Landingham appearance (which was done perfectly) in Bartlet for America.  Sorkin, man. Da best."

Jed and Abby themselves surely don't use it for income. Maybe Jed's brother John does, but I get the impression that it's Jed and Abby's own property.   Jed himself says that he doesn't know enough about agriculture in Season 3 when he's avoiding fighting with Abby. This leads me to believe he never really worked on a farm."

He goes to wipe the blood off and you see blood on the towel right on top of the monogrammed seal of the president. they ended up scrapping it because it was too short, but i always thought that was a really powerful way to introduce that episode.

thewestwing,2twf1c,Receswind,2,Wed Jan 28 18:47:24 2015 UTC,I was curious as to what the video was as I couldn't remember a moment from the end of Season 3 that could make someone cry. Clicked the video... Oh hell no! I now vividly remember the scene now and I'm not putting myself through that again!
thewestwing,2twf1c,TrappedUnderCats,5,Wed Jan 28 17:14:41 2015 UTC,"I also love this scene. However, I find it hard to stay in the moment because I don't find the shooting scene very believable. First, you would expect a secret service agent to have some kind of hand-cuff device on his person and not have to use his black tie. Second, and more importantly, it does not make sense that an agent as qualified as Donovan would not take the 30 seconds necessary to secure the whole store (which appears to be very small). I mean, how likely is it that the robber was not alone?   One of the best qualities of the show was its feel of authenticity and I find that this particular scene (the store shooting) was below the usual standard in this regard."
thewestwing,2twf1c,tc1991,3,Wed Jan 28 10:13:59 2015 UTC,"I've always been a bit confused by Amy answering the phone and knowing  exactly who Simon Donovan was. I guess Josh MIGHT have known him because they both went on the Helsinki trip, but even that is a bit of a stretch since Simon was only guarding her for about three weeks and he was one of several agents on the case. Their reaction to that phone call always seems a bit jarring to me."
thewestwing,2twf1c,WeDoNotKneel,3,Wed Jan 28 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"though in the episode where CJ is buying prom dresses, we learn that Donovan was at Rosylin (sp?) so he's probably been on the presidential detail for a while."
thewestwing,2twf1c,WISCOrear,3,Wed Jan 28 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"Also, was he not wearing a bulletproof vest? I would think that a Secret Service agent, especially one on a protection detail, would almost certainly be wearing one?"

thewestwing,2ttcr6,another_name,2,Tue Jan 27 16:04:08 2015 UTC,Parts of the story were still good but they really did start to rip the characters apart. Don't want to do spoilers as I know a few are still only watching this but I remember watching seasons 5 + 6 +7 and thinking that would never happen to Josh or they wouldn't fight that bad or Toby would def never do that. I noticed the directors changed frequently also and that seemed to have an effect as I can't remember what episode it is but there was one part where they tried to use sound affects to make a dramatic scene in the oval office while doing a still of each character and it ended up really really bad. I truly think Bartlet would have quit before appointing Bingo Bob. His entire second campaign involved being the smarter man and the right man for the job. I actually think season seven got to pick up because they were able to develop new characters because they had destroyed the rest except for CJ
thewestwing,2ttcr6,BigCheeser,2,Tue Jan 27 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the casualness with which they give in on Bingo Bob is a bit of a stretch after ""Because I might die."""

thewestwing,2ttcr6,BigCheeser,0,Wed Jan 28 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"I think CJ was destroyed the worst because it's pretty heavily implied that she did do ""that"" and Toby was saving her."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,OvertFemaleUsername,7,Tue Jan 27 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"I kind of felt that was just bad writing in trying to keep the mystery going she became the main suspect because of her past. It made Toby's change look a lot worse as there were several episodes of showing how much he valued integrity and loyalty, all blown away in one swoop. I think it's only really implied its CJ before the truth comes out which only came because Toby had realised her prime suspect status was destroying the team and credibility."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,BigCheeser,9,Tue Jan 27 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I don't think the writers actually intended for CJ to be guilty and Toby taking the fall to cover for her.  Before the truth comes out, yes they want you to believe it's a possibility.    But afterwards, there is just no way CJ would've sat there and watched Toby's life fall apart to save her ass and never speak up.  No way."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,Landlubber77,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's a tough one. She could only ever have mentioned it in the Oval Office to the President like she did before as press secretary. But as COS she had to back him up, the President's hand were tied and he had to follow protocol and they were only able to talk lightly on the issue when the pardon became possible. The Sorkin Toby for me would have foreseen this anyway and never led them to this position."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,BigCheeser,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:15:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree a bit.  I think it's left to decide whether he was covering her tracks, especially in the second that he says to CJ that he did it.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but there was a look of gratitude and affection from CJ.   I'm also confused as to why it was such a big deal that she knew... since the CoS is supposed to know everything that POTUS does, before he does?"
thewestwing,2ttcr6,OvertFemaleUsername,1 point,Wed Jan 28 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'll need to watch it again just to check but I think CJ was pissed for a bit because of the position they were put in after he admits it, like when she calls over to his apartment. They had a great chemistry and confided in a lot of things, she had confided in him after he initially questions her trust to withhold information from the press especially with her relationship to Danny. Her professional loyalty was was doubted many times and with his admission the tables had turned and they couldn't even confide in each other any longer due to the legal issues. The relationship was changed forever in a mixed moment of emotion, relief and disappointment, maybe I'm reading into it now.  I think it was the republicans that made it a big deal with the investigation again I'll need to watch to refresh. Her role as COS was questioned because of her history and it was all too convenient that top security level info was given from the highest position to the press member she once gave high info to. They questioned her appointment in the first place given her connections and the relationships she had but the only time she was eager to give a leak, Danny was a good boy."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,BigCheeser,2,Wed Jan 28 13:08:16 2015 UTC,"Even Richard Schiff, the actor for Toby, said the new writers never understood Toby and Will. He said Toby would never do such a thing."
thewestwing,2ttcr6,meniscus-,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to Sorkin leaving, there was a strong sense that the writers were responding to criticisms that the show was too liberal and conservatives were not watching (they derisively called the show The Left Wing).    Of course by pandering to conservatives, they had to destroy the characters and all their previous motivations and political ideals, and that's why Season 5 seems so disjointed from previous seasons.  That started to dissipate as Eli Attie took on a stronger role in the writing room for the presidential race in late Season 6 and Season 7, which really saved the show in my opinion."

thewestwing,2ti107,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,9,Sun Jan 25 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"It's the only part of the entire series that truly pissed me off.    [SPOILERS below - sort of]  You pretty much know Santos wins the election because why else would Josh show up to announce that the president arrived?  (I'd say it's a big leap to think Josh would get/take a job with the Republicans, and it's doubtful to think he'd become an aide to Bartlet after he's long out of office.) And while they do obscure the person getting out of the car, it looks way more like Santos than Vinnick. So this scene, while they do a nice thing with the follow up on the main characters (which could have been handled in a better way later), they essentially succeed at revealing also the outcome of the main story arc. All of the suspense for the entire season is pretty much destroyed. It was frustrating."
thewestwing,2ti107,cockybirds,18,Sat Jan 24 12:24:09 2015 UTC,Except that vinnick was supposed to win until Leo died (irl) and the direction of the show changed.

Jed beat Ritchie in a cake walk but the final seasons aren't about Jed anymore, they are about shaping Santos."
thewestwing,2ti107,DesertedPenguin,0,Sat Jan 24 18:25:36 2015 UTC,NY Times article says otherwise.  http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/10/arts/television/10wing.html?_r=0
thewestwing,2ti107,WalterSkinnerFBI,7,Sun Jan 25 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"John Wells said later that this is incorrect, that they were throwing a lot of ideas around in the room, that this was one of them, but that this was never the final decision.   Other statements from John Wells, however, have contradicted O'Donnell's claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O'Donnell stated to camera ""We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our .. just .. plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest ... and it became a real contest in the West Wing writer's room."""
thewestwing,2ti107,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen this a million times. And I never believe it, and neither should you. A writers room without a single registered Republican isn't going to write it so that the Republican wins. Their version of a win for Republicans is that Vinick exists at all. He's an ideal Republican, from their perspective, and an ideal opponent. But that doesn't mean they want him to win. They didn't need to write it so that Leo dies the night of the election. Even writing it that way, Leo's death didn't help Santos to win so I don't believe they saw it making a difference in the outcome. It doesn't even make sense the way Lawrence O'Donnell phrases it. Santos doesn't lose Leo, Josh does. And as is the very premise of this thread, the opening scene of the season is practically a spoiler. If they were really worried about crushing fans' spirits, they don't write something like that just so they can blindside us with Vinick's win later. Articles like this are always crap. The profiled people just want you to like them and they'll say whatever they think will make the readers think of them as smart and clever and empathetic. That doesn't mean they know what they are talking about."
thewestwing,2ti107,ObligatoryHandle,4,Sun Jan 25 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"Even if they don't do this segment, don't you already know that Santos is eventually going to win because this is a TV show and all the main characters are Democrats? There never was any suspense in the outcome of the election."
thewestwing,2ti107,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,2,Sat Jan 24 18:27:23 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but the show could have also been decidedly real about the fact that regimes change. At this point in the show, you don't know that the election will end with 2-3 episodes left and proceed to tell the aftermath. They could have easily had Vinnick win and the Bartlet admin would be over, which was the arc of the show to begin with. They had equally strong actors for both candidates (I'd say Alan Alda might be the best actor ever on the show, actually), so they didn't have to let the Democrats win."
thewestwing,2ti107,DesertedPenguin,2,Sat Jan 24 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was supposed to hint that everyone had moved on with their lives in some fashion or another. Again, Lawrence O'Donnell has specifically said that the plan was for Vinick to win. So none of the characters seen were going to be working in the White House. So the concept was to show what they'd be doing.  With John Spencer dying, the producers decided to have Santos win, but the flash forward still serves to show that most of the ""old guard"" moved on after 8 years in the West Wing."
thewestwing,2ti107,ObligatoryHandle,4,Sun Jan 25 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Half of the sixth and nearly all of the seventh seasons were devoted to the main characters moving on from the Bartlet administration. What it didn't do was set it up so we pulled for Vinick. Vinick did that through sheer force of Alan Alda's performance (with help from the writers making him the ideal Republican candidate from the Democratic Party prospective). But his staff was still full of unpleasant people and the Republican Party still loomed over his candidacy, as shown in his pick of the Agnew-esque hatchet man Ray Sullivan for Vice President. If there was debate in the writers room than Vinick should win, I'm certain it came late in the season once they realized how well Vinick was playing to audiences. He was never supposed to be someone we wanted to win, just someone we knew could or maybe even should win. Santos needed to need his crack staff led by Josh if he was going to win the Presidency.  None of the Senior Staff works on the Santos campaign. None except Josh. Who would take the loss harder than Josh, though? Did they really want to write the final few episodes as soul-searching binge-drinking benders the kind Leo would have had back in his days post-Labor? Or worse - that they just hit us, BAM, with the swerve that that was Vinick getting out of the car and end the series there with the crushing loss. No, I don't believe it was ever the plan that Vinick was meant to win.  Lawrence O'Donnell contradicted his own statements to the New York Times in a BBC interview 2 years later. The quote can be found in the final paragraph from section on the election on The West Wing's Wikipedia page. Here is that paragraph, without the citation notes:   According to executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr., the writers originally intended for Vinick to win the election. However, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided by John Wells that the last episodes would be rescripted. Other statements from John Wells, however, have contradicted O'Donnell's claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O'Donnell stated to camera ""We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our .. just .. plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest ... and it became a real contest in the West Wing writer's room."""
thewestwing,2ti107,sadfatlonely,2,Sun Jan 25 03:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that doubtful he'd take a job with Vinick, because Vinick isn't the usual Republican. He's a moderate, and Josh would love to be in the game, he couldn't sit back for 2.5-3 years waiting for elections to roll around again. I think it'd be similar to naming Arnie Vinick Secretary of State."
thewestwing,2ti107,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:50:01 2015 UTC,"That's true that Josh would love to be in the game, for sure, and he would have probably been able to argue his case for involvement in the administration, if he wasn't already approached with a role in it. Vinnick getting SofS is a bit different though. It's a top-level position that was offered to him as strategic move, both politically and in a practical sense. You could say the same for hiring Josh, but that thought reminds me of when Donna comes looking for a job, and Josh pulls out his file on her. Everything she'd gone on the record saying about Santos was fuel to the fire. I would think Josh's file would have been a few inches thicker. It's something that could go either way."

The show ran for seven years and was centered around the most powerful government in the world; space related topics are just going to inevitably come up at some point.   You could probably find just as many references to WW2, or US-China relations, climate change, any number of big subjects that a real West Wing would deal with.

thewestwing,2tgrxc,bz2013,7,Sat Jan 24 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't read much into it beyond a difference in opinion about technicalities. President Bartlett was much more academic, more concerned with historical details of that nature, whereas Santos was much more results focused.

thewestwing,2tgrxc,penguinmike23,15,Sat Jan 24 02:18:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't see it as vanity or irritation. Especially considering that until Josh became his campaign manager he insisted that his staffers call him Matt.
thewestwing,2tgrxc,BGA33,0,Sat Jan 24 03:01:27 2015 UTC,Right. But there is also another scene where this happened again (I will look it up again).
thewestwing,2tgrxc,Landlubber77,6,Sat Jan 24 09:39:43 2015 UTC,"I see what you're getting at but I've watched the series all the way through somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 times now (it's a problem) and there isn't an instance where Santos is trying to be arrogant to any of his staffers or allies just because they didn't get the term right.  Everything mentioned above is correct about him finding the whole situation funny/surreal.  Now, I can't remember this exactly but there might've been a scene where an opponent comes to visit with him and intentionally calls him Congressman or something as veiled mocking, and he answers them in kind by insisting that he call him President-Elect.    But, vanity, as you're describing?  No."
thewestwing,2tgrxc,ayriana,2,Sat Jan 24 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"I think we have different definitions  of the word  ""problem"""
thewestwing,2tgrxc,whipped_honey,13,Sat Jan 24 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"I would say that Bartlett's staunch old-school formalism, refusing a term that strongly exists in the vernacular, even if not formalized, shows at least much arrogance as Santos' insistence upon it."
thewestwing,2tgrxc,PatKalie,2,Sat Jan 24 01:33:59 2015 UTC,"I thought it was more of Santos trying to convey that he is THE NEXT PRESIDENT. He was only a 3 term congressman, and there will be a lot of people trying to push him around. To me, this was a reminder that he is the one in charge."
thewestwing,2tgrxc,ObligatoryHandle,3,Sat Jan 24 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing. When he is refusing the President-Elect title, he's very verbally combative. Sure, that's Jed, but that's the point. He always argues from the perspective of an inherited royalty. Sure, if he was a dictator he'd be the benevolent kind, and that's why we love him. But he's no man of the people. When he shows himself to be the stuffiest is when he gets pissy about formalities. Like the Dr. Laura ""when the President stand, nobody sits"" or when he's reading the George Washington's etiquette book and calling him a tight-ass."
thewestwing,2tgrxc,BSRussell,2,Sat Jan 24 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"Those are two contrasting stories.  Him calling George Washington a tightass is eviidence that he's less stuffy.  And sitting when the President stands is no joke.  That's not about being stuffy, that's respect for the office."
thewestwing,2tgrxc,ObligatoryHandle,-1,Wed Jan 28 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are, though. He demands respecting formalities when someone like Jenna Jacobs doesn't. But when someone like George Washington tells Jed how to act, he pushes back. In both cases, Jed is the ultimate arbiter of what's proper.  Personally, I think sitting while the President stands is the biggest joke in formality. Should I pull out his chair for him, too?"
thewestwing,2tgrxc,whipped_honey,3,Wed Jan 28 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think it demonstrates Bartlett's reverence for the formalism. It's not arrogance, I think it is an attempt towards humility."

If Sullivan was smart and picked a running mate similar to Vinick who could appeal to moderates, independents, etc, he still could have managed a win I think."
thewestwing,2t3479,Engineers_Disasters,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:46:59 2015 UTC,We didn't get a great look into Sullivan besides a handful of episodes.  I think that makes a difficult to validate any definitive claim to the extent of Sullivan's social conservatism.

thewestwing,2t3479,TribeFan11,0,Sun Jan 25 20:43:30 2015 UTC,Not sure what that had to do with anything...
thewestwing,2t3479,Willravel,11,Sun Jan 25 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"I really liked the Rep. Haflley character. He was a stubborn SOB like Newt Gingrich, but he was also smart, young, energetic, and attractive, which I think is part of why Gingrich never really stood a change at the White House. Plus, I doubt Haffley would have treated his wife so horribly. If the Republicans kept a majority, which seems likely, he would have been Speaker for something like 10-11 years, giving him significant political connections, allowing him to grow power, and to position himself as presumptive nominee. If he was especially smart, he would have given President Santos a few freebee legislative victories so that Haffley could turk around and declare himself bipartisan or post-partisan, even while engaging in heavy-handed partisan maneuvering.   I think Vinnick's run, followed presumably by Santos sweeping in 2010 because of his shrewd handling of the Russia/China situation, would have forced the GOP to shift towards the middle, to more moderate social positions, while fortifying economic conservative ideas, a sort of rebranding of conservatism. This would essentially push Ray Sullivan out of the running. He'd run a strong primary, but he made his career on being a law and order Bible-thumper, and was probably an open homophobe and might have even been a little racist. Despite his promise to support Sullivan, Vinnick would probably get party pressure to back the more moderate-seeming frontrunner, Haffley. He'd mop up. None of the clowns who ran in 2010 would stand a chance. By the time he was nominated, he'd ask Vinnick to be his VP, which Vinnick would accept, making for an extremely strong GOP ticket.   On the left, after what was essentially a Democratic dynasty in Bartlet and Santos, the expectations game would be a huge problem. Hoynes and Russell probably wouldn't even bother. Baker would probably run, but based on what we saw of him, despite being a popular moderate, he seemed about as exciting as a glass of warm milk and wouldn't stand a chance against fire-in-his-belly Haffley. They'd probably want to get someone from within the administration who was also part of the house Barlet built, which to me suggests Sam Seaborn. The problem is that the left has never been good with dealing with scandal, so his dating of a call-girl would immediately be brought up again, his losing congressional campaign, his leaving the Bartlet White House. He'd get slammed by other primary challengers as wishy washy and a quitter or questionable judgment, even after being ain integral part of the Santos Administration as Deputy Chief of Staff for years. Josh, too burned out from staying as Chief of Staff for eight years and with being a new father, bows out of running Sam's campaign, and Bruno retired, so Will Baley comes on board as the head of the campaign, which reinvigorates Sam's chances. Sam would squeak by, just barely securing the nomination, but would be off to a far greater disadvantage than even Santos had.   The campaign would be brutal, far from the mostly noble efforts of Vinnick and Santos. Haffley's a fighter, and has a very political mind. Sam's a genius, don't get me wrong, but I think he'd be arguing with Will quite a bit about strategy. Will would want to get deeply political to go toe to toe with Haffley, but Sam would want the campaign to be about substance. After a particularly bad knock-down-drag-out fight with Sam, Will would go outside by himself to think. Kate, taking off time as National Security Advisor, would go out to support him but the two would end up talking. Kate would ultimately make the point that even if Sam sweeps the undecideds, Haffley has enough base support to win. Sam Seaborn is young, brilliant, forward thinking, the leader of the next generation, and you don't win the Democratic base and liberals with political games, you win them by going left. Hard left. Will realizes that at a 35% approval rating going into September, they don't have much to lose. The Seaborn campaign takes a hard left, supporting every progressive dream policy. Universal single-payer healthcare, cutting 90% of the defense budget and spending that money on schools, ending all corporate welfare and tax loopholes, a totally revamped and powerful EPA, massive investments in domestic infrastructure to rebuild and to provide stimulus, national gay marriage equality, amnesty for undocumented workers, ending predatory trade agreements that export slavery to the third world, a living wage as the minimum wage, etc. And the left responds. A previously largely fractured left finds in Seaborn a reason to organize factions into a movement. Sam's branded a hippy and a socialist on the right, but it doesn't matter. By election day, Sam's at 45%.   While Haffley wins, he only wins with about 52% of the popular vote, and the 18-24 vote breaks 40%, almost entirely Democratic. Pundits admit that if the election had been held a month later, Seaborn would have been elected. On the momentum of the campaign, Sam and Will start pushing hard in swing states during congressional and senate elections, and manage to flip the House and the Senate in 2016, putting Haffley in the same place Bartlet was at previously. Will is asked to become the new head of the DNC, until he leaves in 2018 to run Sam's campaign for president."

I think he'd be around 74, if I remember the show correctly. On top of that, there's a decent chance he'd still be Secretary of State. As a matter of respect to Santos, I don't think Vinick would resign to be a part of the opposition ticket in 2014. Even if he had retired after the first term, I don't think he'd want to ruin a good relationship with Santos by joining a campaign that would be running against a continuation of Santos's policies."

I think he would have defeated Senator John Kerry or even Vice President Al Gore.   You're right, though, that's probably the least plausible part of the hypothetical. I just remember reading that the writers on the show intended for Vinnick to win over Santos, but had to scrub that plan when John Spencer (and thus his character Leo) tragically passed away. That, combined with the fact Alan Alda is still acting and seems to be doing quite well, made me think that it would make for a very West Wingy curveball."
thewestwing,2t3479,elcub,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"I love this, but the only problem is when Santos was elected, the Democrats won back the House as is displayed by the Speaker elections late in Season 7. It seemed like they won a pretty solid majority and Santos would have been popular enough to keep the majority for a solid period of time. This would mean Haffley couldn't be speaker and do all of the things that you said he would as speaker."

Plus the Santos / Vinnick campaign is definitely engaging and Jimmy Smitts and Alan Alda fill the roles wonderfully. Of course, there's some botched scripting and the whole thing with Toby and the relationships we've become fond of deteriorating. But you'll better off for it.

But I think part of it might be based on expectations.  I read too many reviews before plunging into the meat of the series and all I ever heard was how shitty season 5 was, then I just had low expectations to begin with, so I didn't hate it so much.  But to me, season 4 started the decline, and maybe it was that I knew it was a sorkin season, I just had higher expectations that were not met.  I'm on my way out the door but I'll try and come up with some examples later."

When you consider how popular John McCain was (who Vinick is allegedly based on) circa early-2000s, it's not hard to imagine why he was nominated.

In large romps like that - which we haven't seen in a while in real life - there tends to be some wonky results.  But Louisiana went to Clinton in two straight elections, and it was fairly close in 2000 (Bush won over Gore). So at the time that the 2002 West Wing election was sketched out, a charismatic and generally popular democrat winning Louisiana wasn't exactly unlikely.  That changed by the time the show did the 2006 election. Even with a charismatic, minority democrat running, Louisiana - and all of the deep south save for South Carolina - went for Vinick."

Not to mention that Vinnick is a political powerhouse with a solid voting record, and while he's fairly left-leaning on some social issues, he's hardcore conservative on the more major ones, such as the military and taxation.   My thinking is that the GOP thought they were going to have to run against someone like Bingo Bob or Hoynes, either of which could easily be painted as feeble, liars or in the pocket of someone (for good, valid reasons in most cases). But then Santos came up from behind out of nowhere. And by that time, GOP primary season would've been over and done with (since they had a general consensus) and stuck with what they had."

There's a difference between being tested before entry into a position and a forced, sweeping test with no probable cause. Just because there's suspicion, it doesn't mean that law enforcement or the government itself had the right to do that.  When they were tested upon receiving their positions, they were doing so voluntarily. By forcing them to take the test or lose their livelihoods, it violated personal liberties. That's why they are so up in arms about it -- not because they're worried about failing, but that they were offended by the affront to their rights as an American. Now, whether or not that particular right is constitutional is a matter of debate, and that's why it becomes a political issue. But the staff on the show obviously is pretty uniform in their opposition to it (likely bolstered -- at least in part -- by Leo's former addiction issues and the staff sticking up for him), so the show uses that talking point to further its narrative."

thewestwing,2sl03v,dogtown222,8,Fri Jan 16 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"An interesting article, but I think unfair in some parts.   All the Josh Lyman comments.  That's his job.  Josh very clearly describes his job as ""I handle the President's politics.""  It's for Jed and Toby to come up with ideas for reform, and for Josh to get his hands dirty making that happen. I disagree with the assertion that The West Wing was idealistic about politics.  It was idealistic about the potential of politicians.  It wasn't a show contending that grand, sweeping reform was possible.  It was a show contending that there were people out there who would fight for such reform and act in the best interests of the nation and its people.  The college tuition bill ended up dead but that wasn't the point.  That was a story about Josh and Toby, not about college tuition (notice how that particular bill didn't even see substantial debate among staff members of a Sam Seaborn exposition speech, they just discussed it and handwaved some part of the budget they could find it in). The criticism about attachment to actual voters feels redundant.  They show knows that.  They wrote the Iowa episode.  Josh is regulalry critical of the average voter. People need to stop drawing parralels to Obama.  Bartlet was the ultimate presidential candidate.  He not only had executive experience, he was utterly beloved as a governer.  He comes from an old money, American Heritage family.  He had a VP who, by all accounts, was strong enough to win an election on his own and who was perfectly characteristic/geographically matched to compliment Bartlett.  He was a Nobel Prize winning economist and rather conservative on that end.  The Obama Adnimistration is no kind of proxy for the Bartlett administration.   And that ""President Bartlett was a mediocre president"" article?  Clickbait of the worst kind.  It assumes that we are privy to every bill and reform that administration ever makes.  It also speaks witha  profound level of economic ignorance regarding job numbers, saying that slow job growth is excusable when pulling out of a recession but not in a period of economic progress.  Anyone who's ever bothered to think through, much less study, economics would realize that job growth is historically much faster when leaving a recession because there's a speedy recovery to equilibrium, whereas in an economy already at equilibrium job growth tends to be fairly slow paced.  He literally just makes up Bartlett's historic social security reform and assumes that it's bad for the country.  Claiming that Bartlett supported school vouchers because he allowed the one mayor in the uncomfortable situation of being under federal purview to institute a very limited program?  And then they hand wave away ""I guess it's pretty neat that he solved the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.""  Absolute trash."
thewestwing,2sl03v,BSRussell,3,Fri Jan 16 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think this is pretty unfair. It lambasts the guy for not having vision and only caring about beltway politicking, when that was exactly what Josh did too. Yeah, maybe during the last season's Josh became more idealistic, but for the majority of the show he was about concrete legislative achievements, not some grand vision of America. He left that to Leo, Tobby and Bartlet.  Then it goes into complaining that Bartlet wasn't liberal enough, and had no vision for the country. Does this person even watch the show? I am no fan of the Obama administration, but maybe, just maybe, they realized that you can't run the country like a fictional fucking president."
thewestwing,2sl03v,carlucill,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:48:20 2015 UTC,"While interesting, I thought this was off base.  Josh was always the least idealistic, and most pragmatic of the team.

He definitely wasn't above compromising true beliefs for political gain."
thewestwing,2sjzcx,PatKalie,20,Thu Jan 15 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"This all has to do with the election in season 6.  The reason why he stays in the race is because he believes that Americans want to see a last second victory. That relates to the primary because he believes that he has a last second shot on the 3rd ballot. Also, why he realized that he couldn't win once Baker entered the race. (You can see on his face when he realizes it.)"
thewestwing,2sjzcx,barryfc,13,Thu Jan 15 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"I think this is a magnificent realization of a parallel that probably wasn't intended.

Firstly because any of the republicans we are most familiar with will have been defeated in the primaries or the general during Santos' re-election campaign.  Secondly, with the exception of FDR-Truman, parties don't hold onto the White House for that length of time (and I'd argue that FDR-Truman was an extraordinary exception.)

thewestwing,2rwyod,hankhillforprez,21,Sat Jan 10 00:26:20 2015 UTC,I always thought Leo was there to get funding from the rich politically savvy types that would know how important the chief of staff was for bartlet but might be wary of the inexperience of Santos. I think they figured Santos could pretty much carry the ticket if he had enough money to run the campaign the way it needed to be run.
thewestwing,2rwyod,Pepperyfish,7,Sat Jan 10 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, there seemed to be concern in the party/donors  at his inexperience. This balanced the ticket in that respect."
thewestwing,2rwyod,fringly,9,Sat Jan 10 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"There are several reasons he was picked. Santos was a very different type of Democrat than Bartlet, McGarry helped keep Bartlet loyalists on the ticket better than anyone who was feasible, as both VPs were tainted in one way or another politically.   He had experience at the highest levels, something Santos lacked, and would do a good job of advising Santos (and Josh) on some of the political nuances. Leo was a power broker, and could still do a good job at talking to congress. Leo was known internationally by people in government, and would be able to pick up the phone and continue with those relationships where he had left off.   Those all make him a decent candidate, and made him pickable, but they did not make him the best candidate. What flipped it, IMHO, is that Josh was the one picking, and Leo needed a low-stress lifestyle where he could still be a power-broker and and advisor. There is no better low-stress job for someone like McGarry than the office of the VP. A vp can be as active or inactive as the situation demands. So once the campaign was over, he would have the perfect job for his lifestyle and his health.  Josh wouldn't have picked him if he didn't have anything going for him as a candidate, but he WOULD pick him over people who might be slightly better because Josh thought of Leo like a second father."

thewestwing,2rwyod,excalibrax,5,Sun Jan 11 15:33:18 2015 UTC,"Remember that Leo also had been Secretary of Labor during a previous Democratic administration, so he probably wasn't totally unknown to the public.

thewestwing,2rwyod,ObligatoryHandle,5,Sat Jan 10 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"It was a bad choice. Like something the writers thought Aaron Sorkin would do, given his habit of thoroughly unrealistic idealism (Leo's drug problems no longer an issue because he's the right party guy) and overly sentimentalism (Josh picking Leo to repay his loyalty). None of this worked with the plot that Baker had to drop out because of his wife's mental issues. Which is itself more Sorkinism, since Baker was an outsider to our group of favorite characters, but Leo was an insider so we are expected to support the hypocrisy. A very contrived plot, in my estimation."
thewestwing,2rwyod,ObligatoryHandle,3,Sat Jan 10 17:51:38 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Baker's plotline was anti-Sorkin. Baker joining onto the DNC at the last minute was certainly idealistic. And he did not drop out BECAUSE of the mental issues, he dropped out because he didn't go through the primary screening and people were scared about him having anything else hidden"
thewestwing,2rwyod,ObligatoryHandle,2,Sun Jan 11 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that Baker was anti-Sorkin. Just that being given a choice between Leo and Baker and choosing Leo was a very Sorkinesque thing for the writers to do. You're absolutely right about his last minute DNC charge - that would never happen today, but Sorkin would love to make some hay out of an old-timey political maneuver such as that one.  The Vinick/Santos debate was another Sorkinesque gimmick. So much so that Sorkin himself used the idea of ""a real debate"" in The Newsroom."

thewestwing,2rwyod,dfetz3,14,Sat Jan 10 18:44:08 2015 UTC,The way I look at it is that Leo is a giant in the Democratic Party. Someone like Vinnick is the type of moderate republican that can syphon away liberal voters. Having Leo on the ticket assured the democrats that Santos was the real deal.

I would not have chosen him as VP due to his past, his heart attack, etc. I would much rather he had been a senior campaign adviser than VP.  Baker might have been a good choice until his antics at the convention. I wouldn't have allowed him to do that and then get the VP nomination.

thewestwing,2rwyod,d0mth0ma5,3,Sat Jan 10 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"It wasn't covered up at all, they raised the heart attack question in the debate and Leo deflected it onto a commentary on the Santos Health Plan."

As soon as the President spoke to any number of people (Abbey, Josh, Toby, CJ) they would have talked him round if he hadn't come round on his own. As Bartlett has said, Leo is his friend, and he's a man who doesn't have many friends."
thewestwing,2rwyod,ObligatoryHandle,2,Sat Jan 10 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really buy that. They played the scene like that was the end for Leo. Bartlet may go to go to Josh, Toby, and CJ with his concerns about Leo personally, but not for advice when replacing their superior staffer. The heart attack was a plot contrivance to keep viewers from doing what you're doing here, believing a reconciliation was still possible."

thewestwing,2rqtcu,APP6A,-1,Fri Jan 9 08:58:36 2015 UTC,"I hate to burst your bubble, but when really broken down, terrorism has been extremely successful. One of the few examples of it not being successful was 9/11. OBL was very explicit that his goal was to get America out of the Middle East, only to see his actions significantly increase America's presence in the region. But, look what happened less than 3 years later, when Madrid was bombed, with a very similar message getting sent to the Spanish government, which led to Spain withdrawing from the coalition. Personally, ever since, I've been referring to Spanish Harlem as Freedom Harlem, unfortunately, it really hasn't caught on."
thewestwing,2rqtcu,valeriekeefe,1 point,Thu Jan 8 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"Terrorism, as a means of achieving broad political objectives, is wildly unsuccessful. Irish Republican Army attacks have not led to the union of Northern Ireland with the rest of the island. Chechen separatist campaigns have only invited bloody reprisals from the Russian military, and their remains no Chechen state. Kurdish rebels managed to get themselves attacked by all four countries that sit on what they consider Kurdish territory. Kurdistan does not exist as an independent state. Look at FARC in Colombia, the RAF in Germany, and the OAS in France. Did any of them get what they wanted? No. All they got for their trouble was killed.  There have been studies done on this:  ""A RAND study on the end of terrorists groups [...] found that of all the terrorist organizations that have ended since 1968, only 10 percent were victorious (Jones and Libicki 2008, 19).""  ""...the foregoing analysis offers the strongest empirical evidence to date that terrorist campaigns are an ineffective tactic for achieving outcome goals. In terrorist campaigns, the low coercion rate is not simply an artifact of the weakness of the perpetrators, the nature of their demands, or the strength of government opposition. Rather, the evidence indicates that governments resist complying when their civilians are the focus of substate attack."""

thewestwing,2roqnq,awesomesauce97,5,Thu Jan 8 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"I think some people dislike the last season bits about santos/vinick because it took it away from the origins of the story and, for better or worse, took away from spending more time with the rest of the characters we left (every minute of santos screen time was a minute less of bartlett screen time). I didn't hate the 6th season myself (far from it) but I would have been far happier if the end of the 6th season was a lead-in to a 7th season with a new cast in the white house (preferably Vinick for a fresh perspective)."
thewestwing,2roqnq,AdamJacobMuller,3,Thu Jan 8 04:05:07 2015 UTC,I liked it because it shifted the focus and helped keep the show feeling fresh in its' final seasons. Shows that manage to stay entertaining in later years do so by changing up the story line (The Good Wife and Breaking Bad did this well for example).  The downside was definitely that the Bartlett story line didn't feel as compelling as the election story line.
thewestwing,2roqnq,Pleakley,3,Thu Jan 8 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"I think the series hit a major speed bump when Sorkin left after season 4 and it seemed very clear that no one who remained had any clue what the heck they were going to do with the Zoe storyline.  Personally, I feel that they get their groove back when CJ dresses down President Bartlet after the tornado in Oklahoma.   You're the President of the United States. My President. I'm frightened. We're all frightened. This is -- The world is too dangerous now, unpredictable. I need you back. I need you to lead.   It's that moment that I feel the series gets back on track.  If not there, then when Bartlet gets on his horse during the government shutdown and thanks Leo for what he had done the last few months to keep the ship afloat.  But after that, I think the series is phenomenal again all the way until the end."
thewestwing,2roqnq,adamshell,3,Thu Jan 8 06:58:18 2015 UTC,"I liked it but then I'm an election buff, but the one thing about the end of the show that does bother me is that it feels a bit like disaster of the week (which was my biggest gripe with the short lived ABC West Wing 'clone' Commander in Chief) and Bartlett seems to be constantly saving the world, he brings peace to the middle east, and social security and then save the 'world' twice more before leaving office (trying to avoid any spoilers for OP.)"

Also, I assume it's because Josh has far more knowledge of Bingo Bob than the rest of the staff, given his role as legislative liason for the White House.

thewestwing,2rf2yj,CanadianGladiator,7,Mon Jan 5 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"The ""ordinary Americans"" bit is an example of the infuriating way politicians score points by appealing to anti-intellectualism by claiming ""smart people"" aren't ""American"". I like baseball. I like the theater. If I had a choice between the two on a single night, I'd go to the latter but that doesn't mean I wouldn't willingly go to the former on another night or look down my nose at people whose priorities are the other way around.

thewestwing,2rf2yj,asdfjlk55,13,Mon Jan 5 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"I like this scene too, but it also displays some of West Wing's liberal bias. Republicans are too often caricatures in that show."
thewestwing,2rf2yj,sadfatlonely,13,Mon Jan 5 20:03:27 2015 UTC,"I think Ritchie was intended to be a caricature in this case. The whole theme of the election is that intellectualism isn't bad and that you should want smart people in elected office. (See: the conversations between Josh and Toby during the trip back to Washington after being left behind, the ""torpor"" bit (""It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug. It's our job to raise it. If you're going to be the ""Education President,"" it'd be nice not to hide that you have an education."" etc)  Much of the Bartlett campaign's problems throughout that storyline, MS aside, stems from the fact that they were afraid that they weren't appealing enough to that bloc of voters who rate their presidential candidates based on whether or not they would ""have a beer"" with him. This is a thing that real-world politicians do (and have done throughout most of history) multiple times in the past, especially in the 2000 campaign which the Ritchie/Bartlett one was supposed to echo. In the above clip, Bartlett (sorry, President Bartlett) accuses Ritchie of turning being ""disconnected"" into a zen like thing and that if he wants to be a president, a good president, he needs to step up and show that he's an educated man, and that America deserves that sort of thing. The ultimate ""lesson"" of that storyline is that a person like Bartlett should be able to win if he runs an honest campaign and doesn't hide from intelligence.  I think, on the whole, the show is fairly liberally biased but there are numerous examples of well-rounded Republicans who aren't caricatured or demonized: Ainsley, that Joe guy who replaces her, Vinick, that moderate Republican with the ""milk thing"", the one who works with Josh for the Chesapeake cleanup, the gay one, etc. The Republicans that are well-rounded are usually shown to be the political mirrors of Bartlett's staffers, usually. Smart people who passionately believe what they believe. Usually, they're given a moment to soapbox and it's done in a respectful way (Ainsley's speech about the ERA, Milk Republican's bit about the ""sensible center"", etc) that leaves you appreciating their viewpoint, even if you don't agree with it. Ritchie's moment comes (if I'm not mistaken, this is his actual first appearance in the show?) and he whiffs it hard by pulling out the ""ordinary Americans"" canard and that meaningless down-home gibberish. I think that was done absolutely intentionally to put him in opposition to Republicans like the ones listed above and to serve the purpose of the election storyline being one about ""being smart is okay"".  Sorry, this got long, so if I had to put a tl;dr, it would be: Having a character be a ""caricature"" in fiction is not necessarily a bad thing, if it serves the purpose of the plot. Or, as Toby put it, ""Then make this election about smart, and not... Make it about engaged, and not. Qualified, and not."""
thewestwing,2rf2yj,rasiisar,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:35:46 2015 UTC,"I agree whole-heartedly. As you, and others have mentioned, there are many Republicans on the show that were ""good guys"". In fact, I think you said it perfectly in that they were reflection of the senior staff, they just happened to have different viewpoints.   Ritchie serves as a contrast between how politicians run for office (both parties), and how they should run for office, the way Bartlett does it. Ritchie is played as the guy who just uses worthless rhetoric, and crowd pleasing soundbites rather than well thought out opinions, which is why he comes off as stupid."
thewestwing,2rf2yj,Super_J2J,16,Mon Jan 5 22:44:40 2015 UTC,"not necessarily true.

Internal problems such as broad tax reform, privacy, and cyber-warfare are naturally coming into play as well.  As far as cast, I'd love to see Rob Lowe as the President, but I'd also be fairly interested in seeing a powerful woman in the role. It'd have to happen on the condition that the show doesn't go down the ""I'm a woman in office woe is me"" - just as it wouldn't go that way for a man. That said, it'd be interesting if the President were single, for some The American President style drama.  You'd also need a larger senior staff, something the original West Wing tried to do repeatedly and constantly failed at.  You'd need your idealistic leftists in the senior staff, but I'd want a more serious effort by the President to unite the parties. Because of this, I think we'd have a Republican deputy CoS (which I suppose the original WW did have later on).  I'd also like to see some episodes in ""real time."" A national disaster's first hour, as its handled by the press, the people, and the government, and how the President and his staff specifically are dealing with it. I wouldn't want this for everything, but it'd be interesting to contain an episode or two."

thewestwing,2r98om,5secondmemory,2,Sun Jan 4 05:11:50 2015 UTC,As long as Aaron Sorkin isn't writing it. His portrayal of the internet in The Newsroom was not one of his finer moments.

thewestwing,2r7wxn,Workittor,2,Sun Jan 4 09:39:21 2015 UTC,I am just watching this episode before going back to naval college tomorrow :-) good times.
thewestwing,2r83ne,jbbarnes88,12,Sat Jan 3 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"Unequivocally yes. It's a comedy, but it's really good. You'll recognize some elements and lines and actors from WW. But yes! The actors they got are friggin awesome."

thewestwing,2r83ne,iamahonkey,3,Sat Jan 3 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"It does get better over time and eventually drops the laugh track, which I felt was really dragging it down.  I think the bigger problem with it though, is that the characters don't seem believable. Which is a problem most of Sorkin's shows have. You have these incredibly smart, driven, idealistic people who have these grand ideas about how the world is and should be; and they're all working for a knock off of sports center..."
thewestwing,2r83ne,jacksrenton,1 point,Sat Jan 3 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"I had no idea it dropped the laugh track, totally going to give it another shot. Just couldn't get over the idea of ""studio laughter"" in a single camera show. Took me out of it."
thewestwing,2r83ne,elkanor,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:09:36 2015 UTC,"I kinda liked that about it. It was people having principles in the real world, aware of their own responsibility as individuals and entertainment media figures."

thewestwing,2r83ne,ObligatoryHandle,3,Sat Jan 3 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Sports Night better than The West Wing. Same ""incredibly smart, driven, idealistic people who have these grand ideas about how the world is and should be"" whose personal lives are a mess and who are nuts about each other. But these people are more fun to watch (it is a comedy) because of the lower stakes. (Nobody is going to get nuked if Gordon stands up Dana tonight.) The trade off is that they all seem like bigger assholes because they are just reporting sports news, the stakes are way lower than they act like."

thewestwing,2r83ne,Jebus_Jones,1 point,Sat Jan 3 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"I liked it well enough though it really showed me how much Sorkin rehashes the same ideas and dialogue between his shows.   I watched it for the first time last year BTW, have been watching and rewatching TWW since it started."
thewestwing,2r83ne,Dream_Out_Loud,1 point,Sun Jan 4 09:19:47 2015 UTC,"there is so much that gets re-worked into The West Wing that it feels like a rough draft.  i really didn't like the ""we're trying to be ESPN on air"" stuff but everything else was enjoyable and it's undeniably Sorkin.  The entire second season is akin to large chunks of season 3 of the newsroom."

thewestwing,2r6jdn,vengeanceofrain,22,Sat Jan 3 06:09:53 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked the Vice President once he found his balls. You gotta think about him in perspective, though.   Bob Russell was brought in as really nothing more than a filler-character to sew up a plot line (at least to the first-time viewer). He wore cowboy boots, he was blatantly bought off by the mining industry but had a valid reason and most of all, he knew his place. He was the one that got trotted out whenever the Office needed a spokesperson in the field.   But come S6, everything we know about Bob Russell gets turned on its head. Suddenly it dawns on us how devious this guy is. Not in a destructive way, but devious nonetheless. It turned out that Russell is impressively ambitious. He shows this by poaching Will, who he sees as a kindred spirit (and rightly so) and then snapping up Donna later on once her and Josh start to have a spat.   Put it this way: Russell was smart enough that he should've won the Democratic nomination, were it not for Santos. He picked the right people, picked the right issues and most importantly played it safe. This is what Bob Russell was supposed to be: A politician. He played the game, and he played it well. Better than any other character in TWW that I can think of (save Toby with his SS save).   I dunno, maybe I'm rambling. I'm drunk. But that's just my thoughts on Russell."
thewestwing,2r6jdn,hankjmoody,9,Sat Jan 3 07:38:26 2015 UTC,Bingo Bob has more going than meets the eye.  Didn't he flash a bit of knowledge that no one else knew and stopped a needless bombing of Iran?  Or was that some other Bob Russell?  Sometimes Results > Character.    Seaborn '16

thewestwing,2r6jdn,Aoe330,3,Sat Jan 3 11:18:04 2015 UTC,Except Bartlet was elected in 1998 and reelected in 2002. So there wouldn't be a presidential election in 2016 in the WW universe. There would be one in 2014 and another in 2018.
thewestwing,2r6jdn,fairlyodd922,7,Sat Jan 3 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but isn't that the point? Russell is supposed to be the corporate politician who will do anything to be relevant. That's why Toby is so pissed at Will for moving on. Toby wants to make a difference. Will wants to be a politician."
thewestwing,2r6jdn,ALREADYFUCKINGTAKEN,5,Sat Jan 3 07:39:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think Toby was still in the mindset that they lost the pick they wanted for VP and the Republicans would only support someone who couldn't carry enough states after Bartlet's term was over. Since the very beginning, Toby attributed him (and probably rightly so) and a consolation prize from their loss."

thewestwing,2r6jdn,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Tue Jan 13 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like Bingo Bob got a bad rap. Sure, he looks like a pain in the ass from the senior staff POV, but the senior staff always has a habit of overreaching themselves. They don't run the Democratic Party, much less the country. They don't even run the executive branch. Toby and Josh don't have a say in State or Defense or Justice policy. They just run the White House, and that's Bartlet's White House. Bingo Bob has his own administration to think about, and the senior staff might not like it but he's been the one positioned to build the next administration."
thewestwing,2r6jdn,5secondmemory,1 point,Sat Jan 3 21:36:08 2015 UTC,"Even if he is cringe worthy and obnoxious, it's even more sweet when he gets smacked down.  I go back and forth on Will more than Bingo Bob, loved him in California and fighting Toby for respect, thought he was annoying with the VP and then enjoyed him again as Press Secretary and Communications Director."
