That was a HJW and HB's drama and his was just a supporting role. The same could be said for third and second place. They should only count the dramas that the actors actually had a leading role to be more accurate.

While I do love Sulli and Minho, I don't think they were good choices for the roles they played. Their chemistry, though cute at times, is not very believable.

As hot as it was and I think it's canon too (?) it still feels shoehorned in for me and that they came together as each other's consolation prize. I really loved it when Shi Hoo was first introduced too and he pretended he liked Ah Ra. If they had continuity from then on and Ah Ra developing an interest in him from that it would have made more sense. They kind of tried to do that with her bringing it up but too much time has passed where it feels a bit forced.

Jung-hoo seems a bit too ""needy"" after Young-shin goes to him after Jung-hoo's teacher's death. Kind of creepy starting a relationship where someone is all over you like a cheap suit."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,ArtShare,7,Fri Jul 17 18:01:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't like it either, but that doesn't mean it is overrated. People have different opinions and likes and if many people deem something good then so be it. Considering that kdramas could be considered ""art"" and thus no objective opinion can be made, it is only for the observer to judge for themselves."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,Widdrat,2,Fri Jul 17 12:25:40 2015 UTC,"I think it deserved the hype. See, I started watching it without knowing about much of the massive hype other than knowing some people were saying it was good. So, I wasn't expecting something mind-blowing and just gave it a try to see if it was entertaining. Certainly wasn't expecting the next City Hunter or anything. So, I was pleasantly surprised watching it because it was much better than the other shows coming out.  Maybe that's why you were disappointed?   Compared to the other korean dramas that were coming out, it was one of the few solid ones. I agree City Hunter was better, but Healer I think is still a good drama. I see it as there are some korean dramas which are really good and few come close to (classics like City Hunter, Secret Garden etc.) and then some that are pretty good and shine from the rest (aka. Healer).   Anyways, if you want to see why I liked Healer read my essay below. Haha.   I do agree the cheesiness got to me too at parts, especially when it got more romantic towards the end. And that one English song, they kept playing was too much cheesiness for me. Haha.   I liked the characters too. Especially, the hacker. Her character was pretty unique and her acting was excellent. I thought the acting was decent too and I was surprised by JCW's acting only because I've seen way too many pretty actors who don't act well... but JCW managed to be pretty and act decently. The only acting that annoyed me was Yoo Ji-tea. It was also great how everyone wasn't black or white, but somewhere in the grey.   As far as PMY, I found her character one of the more interesting female leads in korean drama so I wasn't much annoyed with her. I did get annoyed how everyone in the show kept withholding information from here because of something like, ""protecting her happiness blah blah"".   As for plot, I thought it was well-written when comparing it to other korean dramas. I don't remember anything in particular standing out and annoying me..."

KDRAMA,3dm6uo,awkwardsoul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah it kind of ended anticlimactically, it was conclusive and but unsatisfying. I just wanted a better epilogue if what they gave us even counts as one. I really don't remember too much outside of the last scene."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,Saya_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:46:46 2015 UTC,"I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. By no means do I think it's a perfect drama, but I'm a sucker for peppy heroines, beautiful male leads, and romance. As Healer had all three in spades, I wasn't not going to love it."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,agehaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"While it certainly isn't as good as City Hunter, I did like Healer.  I liked the media critiques (which might have hit even harder if Pinocchio wasn't airing at the same time).  I found it to be generally funny and entertaining, though perhaps too much in common with City Hunter (PMY as the optimistic naive lovable love interest, son avenging dad, corrupt politicians, weird older person that helps them out, looking for mom...).  The drinking scene ~episode 4 was gold.    City Hunter told the story better though.  Episode 1 of City Hunter did a fantastic job of dealing with the backstory all at once, while Healer used flashbacks to tell general background.  In City Hunter you immediately understood the basics of what was going on, while in Healer I felt completely lost for he first few episodes.  LMH was perfect as a sort of Korean Batman while I have a hard time with JCW as a badass.  The bad guys in City Hunter were also far more compelling.  I mean, come on, one of the main baddies uses a yo-yo?  PMY is pretty similar in both shows, but she did it in City Hunter first."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,oGsMustachio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:42:06 2015 UTC,"And I thought City Hunter was pretty terrible and repetitive after the first one or two arcs.   That does tend to happen when we don't like things because they've been hyped up. Our expectations become impossible to reach or because we're late to the party there's this weird need to be like ""pfft it's not that great of a party anyway~ hmph!"".   It's almost a normal reaction and I've seen it in a lot of people online and in real life. We get weirdly prideful about our hobbies and interests. Works the other way around too when people who watched/played/did something before you try to get elitist about it.  Part of the reason Healer got so hyped up was because it was a drama a lot of people nearly missed out on. It was the sleeper hit so that in itself kind of amplified enjoyment. A drama that exceeds expectations is always exciting.  If you didn't like it as much as others then that's just just a shame for you. Hopefully you'll enjoy your next drama but it really doesn't matter that you didn't like it as much. Nothing is wrong with you for having your own taste."
KDRAMA,3dm6uo,Saya_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:40:56 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed Healer but I watched it without the hype. I saw a post on tumblr of a scene from the drama and decided hey I'll watch this. There are certain elements I look for in a drama and this one had them all so it was hard not to enjoy it. Although I wished the ending was a little longer (seemed rushed) it was good overall. But I could see why some people didn't enjoy it since we all have different tastes.

KDRAMA,3dm6uo,marjin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one. I watched the first 6 or so eps and dropped it. I didn't really get into JCW's character, maybe that's just 'coz of his acting, I dunno. I wanted to watch this for PMY, but I've never liked any of her dramas after City Hunter."
KDRAMA,3dl52n,fizzydrink15,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:52:35 2015 UTC,"Spoiler warning just in case  I was expecting a low budget corny assassin girl with terrible acting and facepalm-worthy special effects but Killer Girl K instead felt more of a three hour Quentin Tarantino movie with really well choreographed fight scenes and nowhere screaming low budget.  If I saw Quentin Tarantino in the credits, I wouldn't have been surprised, more like yeah, knew it.  The acting was on point for the entire cast.  The evil scientist plot was just a setup for a story about a girl turned assassin lured in and blinded by her hate vs a league of assassins which was developed by taking advantage of an evil scientist's money and thirst to get what he wanted.  The evil lady wasn't so much loyal as she liked being the head of this league of assassins and having power, essentially being the top and who knows, it looked like the evil scientist was developing something that could be of use to her.  As for why the soldier who helped develop the SS but later left, either this SS was never supposed to be a hit team to take out the scientist's opponents and was initially just a really good security force or he really believed that the research could of been very beneficial for people in the future which it kinda was but wasn't expecting all the bad needed to get there.  He finally realized things got out of hand and not what he initially sign up for.  There are definitely a lot of things that could have been further explored but I really liked how it was quick to the point, didn't spend a lot of time showing her train, and that it didn't just stop at the Killer Girl getting her revenge but to go forward and to show the realization that revenge shouldn't have been everything.  At the very least, it was one really good action movie/TV show and I really want to see a sequel with the same leading actress.  The romance was awesome...boom he dead.  No long spiel of him finding out about her and trying to convince her to live a normal righteous life.  I was expecting things to turn boring with him doing a superhero act after finding out the truth about her but nope.  In the wise words of Jesse Pinkman, boom bitch!  So unexpected but so good!  (You may back away slowly and run if you so desire, I do not blame you)  I was expecting though for the mom to put up more of a fight since she apparently taught her daughter how to fight.  And she was kinda stupid.  She should of stayed put and trust in the super trained guy who got her out of that evil scientist's lab to begin with.  If there's anybody to trust getting your daughter back in one piece and alive, it's him.  But I guess the cell phone trick could throw a lot of rationality out of the window so can't 100% blame her.  To conclude this essay, it was interesting how they didn't really touch on if the assassin girl was genetically modified or not.  It kinda hinted at the beginning like she was but was she really?  Or was she just a quick learner since she already had fighting experience and hate is undoubtedly one strong motivation to press to the limits and get good fast?  So glad this post was created, been wanting to talk about this show but I watched it like years after it was released  :(  Mmm...to answer your initial question...nope, sorry, don't feel you  -.-  This blew stuff like City Hunter out of the water and back into da choppa."
KDRAMA,3dl52n,Treaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it but it wasn't my cup of tea. Probably, because the plot wasn't developed much... Maybe if there were more episodes I would have liked it more.   But, you brought up a lot of points I was wondering about with the story! Was she genetically modified? Also, the mom annoyed me too. The multiple flashbacks to memories of her or her death scene was annoying too. I'm like... Okay... I get it... She died.. it's sad. I get they had to establish the revenge part of the story, but still... And I had the exact same reaction to the cellphone thing... What? Is she stupid? Okay, I guess she could fall for that. Okay. I see.   As for the SS guy, yeah, that's what I figured too. Taking an educated guess. But, I still think the evil lady was in it mostly because of loyalty because in Episode 1 she mentioned something to the SS guy about the evil scientist being like a father to her when SS guy asked her to leave with him (another plot point I wondered about... what's the backstory to evil lady and evil scientist's relationship?) Of course, she probably enjoyed the power too as you said.   I really wanted to know more about the science. I didn't really understand how it worked? Did you? When the police officer finally revealed their evil to the world, he hinted at them raising babies which confused me? The whole show seemed to tend towards the whole stem cell research= evil... which is a pretty one-dimensional view to the subject.   I also liked how the romance with the guy didn't take over the story too much. It was pretty impressive how strong of a romance they were able to generate considering there wasn't much romance at all. That scene where they went to the amusement park was great. As in, it actually made me care that he died. The bloody white teddy bear... Oh, poor man.   Another huge point I didn't touch on, I liked how Killer Girl K featured a female as the lead in an action drama! And how the stereotypical gender roles were swapped... the high school guy was the romantic interest who dies and the main girl was the bad ass action assassin."
KDRAMA,3dl52n,Treaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:10:14 2015 UTC,"The science reminded me of the movie The Island where  Not sure if it's the same idea or just that it wasn't so much the stem research (or whatever it was but I agree with you, most likely stem cell research) was bad but the way it was approached was unethical and inhumane.  There are probably much better ways to do it but this route leads to quicker and absolute results.  It's been some time since I've watched this show so just going off memory.  I just chalked the science as another typical dude trying to play god.  Now you mention it, it does seem like the evil lady and the scientist had some history.  I don't remember if they ever explained it slightly but it does seem like he helped those two out.  Maybe he gave them money or something when times were tough or maybe more.  Maybe it started off that way but after that flashback, it felt more like the evil lady had her own agenda and she is just using the scientist.  I like how this series obviously had holes because there's no way they could fit everything in a 3 episode show but those holes ended up adding more mystery than being critical and detracting from the story.  I agree, the slight romance was very effective with such a short time.  I didn't mention it last time but that detective really irked me.  He was like your typical good guy who should of died because of how much of a moron he was but because he's justice, it's okay, he lives and hey, even gets to bust down this huge case.  He was practically handed a promotion on a silver platter.  I like how the main female lead never really broke down and cry herself a river and wallow in her sorrows.  She accepted the circumstances and proceeded to deal with it without hoping for somebody to save her.  That was really good and I appreciated the writer and director for doing that."

Funnily enough, there has been no K-drama in my life this past week. I've finished season 1 of True Detective. Finally got myself watching season 4 of Game of Thrones.

I also love Yoo-Bi, she is adorable and I like how assertive she is - I love a strong female lead! I'm not usually a huge fan of Sageuks but I like when they have a twist, SWWTN gives me lots of Gu Family Book vibes. Fingers crossed it stays as good!  Masters Sun - I watched the first episode months ago but then left it, thank god I decided to give episode 2 a go. Really fun drama! Okay it's not the best drama I've ever seen but Kong Hyo-Jin is so much fun to watch and I don't usually like cold male leads but he is kinda eccentric which makes it fun.  Good Doctor - This will be my third time re-watching this! I love this drama so much, it hold such a special place in my heart :') I'm sure everyone has that one drama that they just can't get enough of.

They dropped a bunch of raw episodes weeks ago, but are only subbing two a week. So frustrating.  The Time I've Loved You - Male lead is starting to be a bit annoying.  I Order You   Finished Prosecutor Princess and season two of Japanese drama Switch Girl.

The Time I Loved You / We Were Not In Love - I reaaaaaally love everything between the leads. I could care less about the second leads. I Remember You / Hello Monster - Enjoying this. Unsure how they're going to proceed with the brother at the end though unless there's lots of hand-waving redemption arc.  Oh My Ghostess - I'm enjoying this although it hasn't quite captured me. I love the sass though.  High Society - I've mostly been reading the recaps on dramabeans because I can't handle watching it. I do love the secondary couple though. I don't get why the female lead is supposed to forgive the male lead so quickly. Her friend saying it's similar to what she did (disguising her privileged background) is... wrong. Someone buttering you up to be a perfect boyfriend to utilize your rich background to better his life is not the same.

High Society I really like the  themes that the writers bring up but the show isn't executing them in the best way. However, there is so much pretty on screen I can forgive it.  Oh My Ghost I love this show! I'm a fan of Jo Jung Suk(Chef Sun-Woo) and Kim Seul Gi(Soon-Ae) but I've never heard of the actress playing  Na Bong but she is blowing me away. The show is both funny and heartwarming.  The Time We Were Not in Love I'm also enjoying this show . The best friends falling in love is almost always a winner for me. It's why Reply 1997  was so enjoyable.  Scholar Who Walks the Night I thought this was going to be so bad but it one me over. The vampire stuff is a bit cheesy but the actors are so handsome I can look over it. It's entertaining.  Last but not least, Pinocchio I put off watching this for a long time because I don't like the main actor (for some weird reason). Anyway it's good but, I still don't get the hype.

I really love it and really enjoy the two of them. I'm not thrilled they're categorizing it as ""stalking"", but if I knew someone had some sort of connection to what happened to my father, I'd probably have tunnel vision when it came to them, too. Plus, that confession booth happened when she was a girl and I can imagine that she might know his house well, too, by exploring it as a child. I can hand wave both of these things. For whatever reason, the other stuff doesn't bother me. She's obsessed with with happened to her father, so for me it's difficult to blame her.  For now I'm willing to wait and see if there's an explanation that has yet to be revealed.   I dunno, I just don't find her annoying, stupid, or creepy and think she's pretty sympathetic.  Plus, that stuff aside, I'm really digging some of the camera work."
KDRAMA,3dgesx,agehaya,3,Thu Jul 16 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Well to justify the stalking, I would say its a habit she picked up when she was a kid and no one really thinks clearly at that age (especially in a korean drama). She may not be brilliant, but she is at a learning stage in her career, so she is allowed certain lapse in knowledge.   Also if there wasn't a Watson, how would Sherlock explain his theories. Almost all crime dramas have a dumb idiot for this particular reason. And I do love Seo In Guk, how he transforms himself for every role he has ever played."
KDRAMA,3dgesx,negl,2,Thu Jul 16 17:14:43 2015 UTC,She stalked him because she thought he was a murder suspect or something so that justifies it? Her stupidness I somewhat agree with you. It extends to the whole special team who can't seem to solve a case on their own after Seo In Guk's character arrives. Given their special team status you would think they would be somewhat capable but we haven't seen that at all.

I agree with you on the incompetency. It's ridiculous, I don't know if it's supposed to be funny, because it's not. It's not even silly stuff like USA cop shows with crazy unbelievable tech. They just do such stupid things.  Maybe it's a way of making the supposedly ""genius"" character seem more smart when they don't actually know how to write them as a genius? If they are comparatively a genius maybe they think it would be believable. lol"

KDRAMA,3ddspg,gatchaman_ken,4,Wed Jul 15 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"I loved it. I love revenge-oriented kdramas, but while I love City Hunter/Pinocchio/Healer, they're all more centered around the guy's revenge. I loved that Angry Mom was mostly centered around the women and their relationships/flaws/angst. Obviously, the male characters were important too, but they weren't integrated at the expense of the women. Plus, this was one of those rare instances where two guys are killed to further the female protagonist's angst.  The story was also really well paced, and I love seeing how the different characters change over time. I think my favorite arcs were the questionable high school ""friend"" lady and the baby faced teacher (I'm really bad at remembering names).  The only flaw I can think of is creepy teacher being so stupid that he thinks running over a phone and not checking to see that it's destroyed is actually a solid plan to get rid of evidence. That just didn't make any sense to me."

KDRAMA,3d6m8q,Snickerdoodled,2,Tue Jul 14 00:34:38 2015 UTC,Entirely wrong? Is it not about a divorced man who finds love through cooking?
KDRAMA,3d6m8q,Uanaka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I would say Park Song Ah is the POV character because we see her daydreams and fantasies and hear her internal monologue (not Gookdae's), and she is employed at a marketing company and has a whole second story line between her and the new guy at work who she shared a traumatic event with in the past. Gookdae is divorced but it is played out like that was some huge shock at the end of episode 5 so it doesn't seem right that the synopsis should start out with that."
KDRAMA,3d6m8q,Snickerdoodled,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"Why does he say he's married; instead of, saying he was married? It doesn't make a lot of sense to be upset over kissing someone just due to being in a previous relationship."

But it seems like the lawyer hates Lee Hyeon and I can't understand why except maybe he's mad LH never looked for him?  The end of episode 7 was like ""yooooo is everything going to be okay?""

KDRAMA,3d67zl,Blackmarketbeagle,3,Mon Jul 13 21:05:51 2015 UTC,It is considered an old fashioned and somewhat embarrassing name. I think I read once that it means third martyr and if I remember correctly her father or grandfather was so upset she was another girl that he named her that.   It would be equivalent to Bertha or Gladys.
KDRAMA,3d67zl,Dedemao,2,Tue Jul 14 06:34:07 2015 UTC,I got the impression it was just very old fashioned. Didn't it mean something like 3rd daughter?

I don't think that has changed because I didn't really have a type anyway.

I have been watching for about 6-7 years and at first it was just stuff to watch but as I got older I took an interest in the culture. Ate the food, learned how to cook it, self-taught myself Korean, got into kpop (still into it but not as hardcore), and all of it led me to taking Korean in college. And because of that I met one of my current best friends.   The Korean drama community is always so friendly and honestly I've met some of the best people because of it.   Dramas also may have raised my expectations in the dating world. Where are my back hugs and random arm grabs? No one stopping me as I leave for my plane?

I've definitely had cravings for Korean food after watching dramas (Let's Eat, you are SO mean!).  I have gotten more interested in Kpop bands from seeing dramas (Apink, 2PM, Infinite).   I think the biggest thing I've incorporated into my life was a jealousy of the beautiful skin of Koreans in dramas, which led me to start using Korean beauty products. I hang out at the AsianBeauty reddit when I'm not in this one, and my troubled skin has really been much easier to manage.

We have a local Korean restaurant that we frequent several times a month as well.   Since we've been watching Empress Ki this week we've been looking up a bit about the actual history since as older whitebread American dolts we learned basically zip about non-European history growing up. It's been a good way to start correcting some of those faults in our education.   Also I've discovered a whole new group of men to drool over. I have a very tolerant husband. ;)
KDRAMA,3d03vu,blarrrgo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. I looked up the Empress Ki cast after you mentioned the men and now I know what you mean. Watched Ji Chang Wook in Healer. He is one handsome man. Unfortunately, I can never get into historical dramas though..."

KDRAMA,3cy0bd,Elnathan,3,Mon Jul 13 13:32:33 2015 UTC,His reason for not loving HaNa back in Highschool due to what his friends/classmates says is really lame IMO. They better give him a good reason as to why he didn't confess to her as adults.
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,Enter_Text_Here,3,Mon Jul 13 03:52:45 2015 UTC,I thought that it was almost established that it's partly because he's afraid of loosing her. He's afraid that if they start a relationship and it fails he'll lose her forever. Their friends who lost a 17 year old friendship when they called their wedding off only confirmed his views. He also doesn't understand the concept of getting back together with your ex. The fear of loss he's gotten from losing his mother as well as some sort of distaste for acting out of passionate love as his mother seems to have done. Which is ironic because by doing this he's risking that Ha Na does the same thing and abandons him for another passionate love as well.
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,Meraxees,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:40:03 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought too, it probably has more to do with his relationship with his mom. The relationship you have with your parents can some times affect the outcome of your relationships with other people.   Although it does seem they both lack the courage to confront each other with feelings."
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,crispyporkbelly,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"Liking it so far. I watched In Time With You over the week (and finished it lol) and I don't think people should compare the two.

Those were always my favorite because you usually see Won's love for Hana lol.   Was a good episode that is helping move along the story line. Sometimes I don't like when dramas use too many flashbacks but I think so far this drama does it all right. I always like that, ""OH THAT'S WHY"" feeling.  Excited for episode 6 because the preview looks like a lot of development will happen."

Like you said, i think they're using flashbacks appropriately, they're giving us more and more context to everything. Was Seo Hoo and Won friends before? Is that secret that they mentioned how he was beaten up for liking Hana?"
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,Uanaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:10:54 2015 UTC,Right? It just makes me so happy when they show flashbacks of the little things Won would do for Hana without her knowing. One of my guilty pleasures in dramas because it shows how much one character loves another ahhhh.   Oh that's interesting! I never thought they'd be friends before. Maybe. I've been trying to come up with possible secrets but I think I will officially write them down here after episode 6 :) but my top pick is that of course he loves her haha.
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,DotToYourCom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:07:44 2015 UTC,I thought he was beaten up in high school. I figured Seo Hoo came after college.

KDRAMA,3cy0bd,Uanaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"Just finished episode 6. These flashbacks are killing me with feelings. The library flashback at the very end just... ahhhhh. And the answer to Won's question at the end is a ""Hell yes you can"" haha.  I like how this drama focuses on the problems in romantic relationships but every now and then teaches little lessons on other aspects of life like overcoming work problems, family, etc.  Overall, still liking the drama.  Oh and, at first I was like wow go So Eun get your man but now it's getting to a point where I am annoyed but I don't think it's a character thing. It's more like, why can't I be upfront about my feelings like she is. I envy her lol.  EDIT: oh yeah, there are so many secrets now in this drama and I just want to know everything. Super excited for episode 7. Sad I have to wait 6 days lol."
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,DotToYourCom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:25:39 2015 UTC,"So Eun is the only one being up front about her feelings. Choi Won agreed to be her boyfriend earlier, but neglected as soon as Ha Na started showing interest in the intern. He has yet to officially break up with So Eun. He's trying to fade out, which is as cowardly as not being able to tell Ha Na how he feels all the these years.  I wonder what Seo Hoo thinks Choi Won did that was bad enough to be a no show at his own wedding. I'm guessing it will bad enough that Ha Na starts up with Seo Hoo again. I don't think Ha Na and Choi Won will get together until episode 15."
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,gatchaman_ken,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:08:50 2015 UTC,Choi Won said straight up to So Eun in ep 5 that he only thinks of her as a hobae and she said that she knows he doesn't like her but she's going to follow her heart anyway(or something like that) so I'm not sure how you're getting that he's stringing her along.
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,whitesnow5311,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:36:30 2015 UTC,"In the translation I saw, he called her a nice, bright and charming junior. He didn't say ""only"". That's not quite the same as saying you have no chance or let's break up. That's still a very weak way of breaking up with someone, if that's the extent of the conversation."
KDRAMA,3cy0bd,gatchaman_ken,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:57:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's going to be a while before they actually get together. Hopefully we'll get at least some fan service with them as an adorable couple.   I really hope that Choi Won didn't actively try to get Seo Hoo to not show up to the wedding. I hope it's more in line with protecting Ha Na afterwards and not letting Seo Hoo explain his, maybe legitimate, reason for not showing up."

Eun Ho's got such a loyal support group, while Eun Dong's got... a shitty father and husband.   Jae Ho is no different than Eun Dong's father. They both made selfish decisions that benefitted themselves. That's their downfall. Their definition of love for one's child is obsession and greed.  I like how Eun Ho and Hyun A's conversation played out--well there was a lack of one, but there was so much respect and understanding exchanged. I knew Eun Ho could figure it out. He just needed some time to think about the facts.   Also, looking forward to the next episode. It looks like we may get to see Jae Ho walking before this drama ends! Woo hoo! This drama is so crazy. haha."

It's crazy how a little boy could spark a potentially lethal conflict for either party. I admit the conversation between Hyun A and Eun Ho (Or lack of, like you stated) was so tense, you could practically just sense what they were thinking. I think episode 14 is going to cliff hang on the big finale for next week. I'm so stoked but sad for the ending, such a great show, amazing cast, haven't been this drawn to a kdrama is a long time, hah."

KDRAMA,3cxvb7,kdrama99,9,Sat Jul 11 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"You should read Dramafever reviews which I find are very fair (they usually recap the shows ep by ep)  I disagree with a lot of points that you brought up for Producer. KSH is by no means a bad or even average actor, he always portrays a different character and in this case (Producer) he's portraying a heodang/sheltered/privileged kid who really doesn't know anything about life and knocks it out of the park imo. Throughout the show we see him making progress and growing as an individual. Also, the other main lead's name is Ra Joon Mo not ""Room-Jo"" and is played by Cha Tae Hyun. IU is a good actor when she doesn't have to be the lead and so she ended up being a really strong character (esp in the final 2 episodes which you haven't watched!) She's definitely not as bad as people make her out to be. You say Tak Ye Jin (Gong Hyo Jin) is the only good actress in the drama, but you also have to understand the drama changed directors and went through a stylistic overhaul so the drama does feel disjointed and the writing severely underutilized CTH's character. You should definitely watch ""My Sassy Girl"" if you haven't as it's one of the most famous Korean rom-com movies of all time and a really, really good movie.  There's no way I could give SG a 10 as well. HJW and HB were excellent and overall it was a great drama, but the side characters were rather lacking for me as it was hard to connect to them very strongly.  Anyways, it seems like you like rom-coms a lot and of course everyone has different tastes and preferences!"
KDRAMA,3cxvb7,gr1zzlybear,2,Sat Jul 11 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with your take on The Producers. Although i wasn't jumping up and down waiting for the next episode, it was a solid and above-average drama. Kim soo hyun played the shy/introverted role perfectly as it really reminded me of myself a few years back. In my opinion Gong Hyo Jin's prowess in acting is beyond any actress i've ever seen."
KDRAMA,3cxvb7,mykokkburnz,3,Sun Jul 12 12:39:50 2015 UTC,Gong Hyo Jin forever. She is just so great. Every character I've ever seen her act in (quite a few dramas now that I think about it) she has always been superb. Always look forward to her acting.
KDRAMA,3cxvb7,DotToYourCom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:15:51 2015 UTC,"the side characters were rather lacking for me as it was hard to connect to them very strongly.   Seriously?    The Oska sidestory was the only thing saving this drama from being a complete failure in my book, says team Kim Sarang."
KDRAMA,3cxvb7,springbay,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:41:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the SG part. I watched it as it aired and it made it exciting but when I rewatched it years later with my family in two nights, I sat there thinking, ""wow how did I watch something so repetitive"".  Also agree with the Producer part especially about Kim Soo Hyun. I think OP will get a better feel for KSH as he watches more of his dramas to see how well KSH studies his rolls :)"

There was a lot more backstory than intended, and they basically resolved it all, in half an episode which kinda disappoints me. But I do appreciate it that they get it over with quick, instead of dragging out the drama trope for a long time."

KDRAMA,3crqkc,MousieSshi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:39:49 2015 UTC,My study has been pretty informal cuz life won't let it be much more right now. I watch a lot of dramas and listen to a lot of kpop so I hear it a lot. In my down time I use vocabulary apps on my phone. I have a few korean language books I read when I can.  I worked hard at sight reading Hangul so I can pronounce the words properly as often I find romanization a hindrance. I have a Korean friend that helps me nail down pronunciation.   What helps is I have a really good memory naturally and I am already bilingual. My second language is not related at all but I link my new word to the translation of both which helps my retention.  My biggest failing is grammar as I don't have much of a grasp on it at all. Which makes it impossible for me to communicate but I can understand the root word pretty easily and use context and body language to extrapolate meaning.   edit: spelling
KDRAMA,3crqkc,bickets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:35 2015 UTC,Yup. Rearranged the furniture in my living room and none of it even faces the TV anymore. The TV has turned into the big black thing in the corner I dust off every once in a while until football season starts.

KDRAMA,3crqkc,Treaya,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:39:10 2015 UTC,"Was more directed to those who don't already have a Chromecast or some sort of a media streamer which does the same thing.  But yeah, if you already got a Chromecast, I agree, not worth spending an extra 85 bucks.  Not to mention a Chromecast is a whole lot cheaper.  On a site note, do you use the Viki app?  I tried using that with Chromecast and I find it really buggy.  I load it up on my phone and cast a video and when I lock the phone and unlock it over some time to pause the video, it starts doing weird things like either not working, working once a while, or just reloads the entire video from the beginning.  Can't tell if the app is buggy or I need another phone.  I'm running Android KitKat 4.4."

However, this is the KDrama recommendation mantra that I live by: always recommend the Reply series lol. Them and It's OK, That's Love are probably my favourite series' I've seen. It's also good to go through and watch the 'big' dramas of the last few years, e.g. Secret Garden, Coffee Prince, Fated To Love You (though that wasn't really my cup of tea), etc.  I also think that, judging by what shows you like, you would really love Shut Up Flower Boy Band. That was the first show I really fell in love with and binge watched and cried over.   Hope that helps :) Other than that, I tend to choose what dramas to watch based on what interests me, who's in it, what people say in the comments section, and the average rating (though these can be misleading).

So much happened in the first episode, and not like useless background plot, but things that mattered. Lots of things that explain why certain things happened, and it was context that I enjoyed.  Most dramas do like a background episode that bring you up to speed, that usually has me skipping through it but not this one. This was enjoyable.  *SPOILER*  I didn't expect half of the cast to get wiped out in this episode, nor did I expect a time jump. I went into the drama assuming he was already a vampire, and that he would protect the crown prince... boy was I wrong."

I'm excited to keep watching. I'll definitely read the webtoon and hopefully they don't pull an orange marmalade!  I knew Myung Hee would come back, Viki stated Kim So Eun as a ""main character"" and the main character can't die in the first episode. I have a feeling she may be ""brainwashed"""

Pretty Vampire (let's face it, he is) and his eyebrows trying to find out the secret plan. Vlad the Vampire (Lee Soo-hyuk) schemin' with his Phantom of the Opera candles and lair and whatnot. Hoooooooo man!  I think Lee Soo-hyuk's voice is very...appropriate. Sort of dark and brooding, sort of cliche. I think she's just reincarnated(?) Or the likeness of. AsianWiki always had Kim So-eun as a double character."

I'm only partway into the first episode but it seems like Lee Soo-hyuk is channeling Tom Hiddleston's vamp in Only Lovers Left Alive though I guess that's pretty much a classic vampire character. Maybe its just the hair.
KDRAMA,3cmq9s,danuv,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:49 2015 UTC,The hair. The voice is a bit vampire-y as well. I freaking love it!!

I remember you is getting better slowly can't wait until the romance stuff cuz that's really what I'm watching for  Oh my ghost the first two episodes were hilarious can't wait for the next episodes. People said it was slow/too many characters introduced but I disagree with them it was perfect.   The time we were not in love or the time we were in love (not sure which is right) which is like a space filler that I may eventually drop if it stays annoying.  The Taiwanese dramas Murphys law of love and when I see you again which are supper fun and cute.  Also saw the first episode of the new live action death note show that's currently airing. The episode was kind of fast and different from the original (not in a good way) but I'll give it a 3 episode shot.  Gave up on My love eun dong because I can't support the main couple anymore and the leads just became annoying."

Both Bong-sun and Soon-Ae made me really feel for them, hopefully we get to see both thought the series."
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,deathbychopsticks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"I thought the first episode was a bit slow, mainly because I really dislike the ""weak and frail"" main characters and there was a lot of inane backstory. But the second one definitely picked up the pace."
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,Uanaka,3,Thu Jul 9 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh My Ghost. I haven't made a decision about whether I really like it or not. Waiting for it to get a little deeper into the plot first.  I was going to start Scholar Who Walks the Night but it's not even 70% subbed on Viki yet. I feel like their subs used to be much faster. (That is not in any way meant to be criticism of the subbers there, but it is a bit of a bummer when Viki used to be so lightning fast. Now it seems even really popular/anticipated shows take a long time to sub.)  In non-kdrama news, I was also going to grab the first episode of the new season of Hanasaki Mai ga Damattenai because it was supposed to start today, but no one has released a raw of it yet. TT___TT It's just the kind of fluff I want right now."
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,honmamichin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:25 2015 UTC,The volunteers for The Lover and Hello Monster worked really fast. I think it depends on the actors/actresses and the fandom strength. Popular people (like Yoochun on Sensory Couple) make shit happen.  We're a day or so out from the first episodes. New dramas take a week or so to figure out.
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,life-finds-a-way,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"Lee Jun-ki is pretty hype-worthy. Also I was not impressed by sub speed with Sensory Couple. I dropped it about halfway through because I got tired of the story, but there were missing subs on Viki a lot of the time through the first half.   ETA: Again, not criticizing the subbers themselves. I know they are unpaid volunteers, etc., but Viki as a whole is not as reliable for fast subs anymore for whatever reason. It's become less attractive to me as a place to watch dramas these days because of that."
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,honmamichin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"I thought the speeds were fine.   I don't know if there's a new system or if people wanted to address problems in the past, but it seems whatever they're doing needs more time to work. Or better QA/QC."

KDRAMA,3cmc4s,Kordiana,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"For dramas, it depends. But I'm surprised... Scholar Who Walks the Night is a Wednesday/Thursday drama... they finished subbing it Wednesday night (CST) if that's not fast..."
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,Uanaka,3,Thu Jul 9 14:17:09 2015 UTC,"Hidden Identity is just so damn good. I think it has to be how slick the production, acting and visuals are. The chemistry of Team Investigation Five is great; it reminds me of Bad Guys. Tae-Pyung is hilarious and Min Joo is such a badass. How Team Leader Jang is portrayed seems perfect for an investigation team that doesn't necessarily follow the letter of the law. My only qualm is Gun-Woo because I don't necessarily follow how he is able to contribute to the team because he doesn't offer insightful suggestions or anything like that. Perhaps his determination resulting from how he is invested in catching the main protagonist and skills as a trained fighter is what he can offer. In any case, I think the writers will bring his character arc to the forefront soon and focus on him more (Ep. 8 :D).   I am fascinated by the dark, gritty tone this show has-let alone the fantastic, ruthless fight scenes-and the antagonists of this show. The suspense is well done for sure. The web that connects everything seems to get bigger each episode and I can't wait to see how it all plays out!  Edit: Forgot to mention but the soundtrack is godly and always fits the mood of the ongoing scene. Plus they use one of the songs by Piano Guys which is of course awesome: Moonlight"

As for non kdrama - Teen Wolf, Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters, Scream the TV series, The Astronauts Wives Club"
KDRAMA,3cmc4s,Haruberry,3,Thu Jul 9 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"Hidden Identity - Only have watched the first couple of episodes, since I'm watching this with my SO, and we don't sit down to watch it very often. But so far it reminds me more of Kmovies, which means I am not holding out for a nice clean ending. But I like seeing a rougher side to Kim Bum.  High Society - I am really liking this one. I never knew Park Hyung Sik was so cute. He always looked too boyish in ZE:A promotions. The new look suits him. Plus I really like the dynamic between all the characters.  I Remember You - I always forget how much I like Seo In Gook until I see him in another drama. But I am really enjoying trying to decide what kind of character he is, and his relationship to everybody else. I already have my theories, and I can't wait to see if I'm right or not.  Mask - At first I just wanted to scream at the two main characters, and blink at how different Yeon Jeong Hun is in this role versus Vampire Prosecutor. But now, they are finally making some progress, and I think that I have less to scream about, kind of. There are still things. I am curious though, Hoya said that he could relate to the character from his own personal life, and it makes me curious about which parts he relates to.  Orange Marmalade - I have gone back and forth with this one. I liked the original premise, but when the first part ended after 4 episodes I figured they would each be little snipet stories that told different potential lives of the same characters. But then the second one lasted 5 episodes instead of 4, and looks like it is leading into a next life sort of situation for the last bit of the drama. Which really seems to alienate the first part of the drama. So I don't know how to feel about it. I guess it will depend on if they tie it all together, or just leave the first part as a stand alone.    I am planning on starting The Scholar that Walks the Night. I can't wait to see Lee Joon Ki in another historical. And I am also interested in seeing Changmin as a playboy character, as he just oozes innocence and naivety to me.   I also have been trying to get myself into The Producers. I have heard such good things about it, and I really like so many of the actors/actresses in it. But I had a hard time with the first episodes, so I am kind of dragging my feet.   Besides that I started marathoning NCIS. I haven't watched it since my dad died, since we used to watch it together, and re-watching it reminds me of him, and how much he is just like Gibbs. I can sympathize with Denozo, I got the 'Gibbs slap' many a time."

Maybe watching historical dramas with someone will keep me going since I've yet to finish one. Joo Jin Mo is still hawt but not quite as yummy as he is in MLED.

I didn't see the other one, and not going to until after I finish this.  Oh My Ghost - Cute, but a little confusing. The two lead actresses are great. The writing is a little muddy.  The Scholar Who Walks the Night - a bit more gory than I was expecting, especially after the lukewarm puddle of milk that was Warm and Cosy. Still, I think it's very compelling so far."

Also not sure about the sister in law being so freaked out with the truth. She purposely put drugs in the wine and threw her in the pool but what was she trying to do if not kill eun ha in broad daylight in an area with a bunch of cctvs while her brother was watching. Also does she not realize that she could go to jail for murder if people find out the ji sook is a fake.
KDRAMA,3ckpil,capesmithpavilion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing Bro in-law probably doesn't have the most recent pic  of the real Eun Ha, since their relationship was a secret. I think he just made do with Ji Sook's pic since they look the same and he missed her."
KDRAMA,3ckpil,Enter_Text_Here,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree.

KDRAMA,3ckpil,Nukari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"At first, I truly felt sorry for the sister in law. She desperately wanted a husband and a family, but now she is going to extremes to make sure Eun Ha is exposed. Right now, she is beyond stupid. When the truth gets out, who is going to hurt more- Eun Ha possibly facing repercussions for fraud or her doing jail time for murdering someone? Because this is a kdrama, I'm positive Min woo will forgive her and love her as Ji Sook. How can she hope to gain any satisfaction from this? It seems that all logic has been thrown out the window and she wants to drag everyone down to the hell that she's living. Again, I also don't know why she is acting so surprised. If you Bill Cosby someone (aka roofied), they become incapacitated, and are unable to swim if they fell in a pool. Did you really make peace with yourself and think she wouldn't die? Please....she wanted it to happen. She's only sorry she got caught."

I had some issues with it toward the end that made it not quite perfect for me, but it was pretty darn close. As far as others... I would rank Reply 1997 very high. Also Healer was very good. City Hunter and Arang and the Magistrate are up there too--I have used both of those as ""gateway"" shows to get other people interested in kdrama, haha!"
KDRAMA,3chcrs,Suuki_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:38:02 2015 UTC,"Haha I felt like I was breaking a rule or something :p Reply 1997 has been mentioned heaps on this subreddit, I guess I should check it out.  So many dramas to watch, not enough time! I don't know how i'll be able to get anything done, how the heck does everyone else on this subreddit manage their time. I barely watched anything before Kdramas but now its a whole different story ;-;."

KDRAMA,3ccmme,Jaqnae,6,Mon Jul 6 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's a good answer to this question, since most websites use multiple groups to subtitle. It varies widely from show to show on just about every site I've used."
KDRAMA,3ccmme,lynnb496,7,Mon Jul 6 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"Which websites have you been going to? The thing about translating from one language to another is that nuances are difficult to translate and can be very long, depending on how much you want to covey to the people who are going to use the subtitles. You might think they're wrong (and maybe at times they are), but for the most part they aren't.   To answer your question though: I've found that Dramafever tends to Americanize dialogues and some very small parts of the speech are omitted but for the most part they convey the same thoughts as the original script in Korean. Viki has much better quality overall as they tend to explain stuff more."
KDRAMA,3ccmme,typecfl,8,Mon Jul 6 23:25:31 2015 UTC,"If you are learning Korean, I think you will prefer Viki's subtitles. They leave a lot of Korean words that are somewhat ""common knowledge"" such as oppa, unnie, sunbaenim, etc. Keep in mind Viki has volunteers sub, so very rarely you may see a mistake or two, but someone usually corrects it quickly."
KDRAMA,3ccmme,HorcruxDestroyer,4,Mon Jul 6 23:20:44 2015 UTC,I find that Viki has a lot of mistakes though? Granted I haven't used shows on Viki for a long time and I'm aware that there are many different subbing groups subbing different shows but many times they would get the tone of how things are said incorrectly or just throw in swears when the character wasn't even swearing.
KDRAMA,3ccmme,gr1zzlybear,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah it ultimately depends on the subbing group. I remember watching a drama where there were unnecessary swearing captions but I think that was eventually fixed by the editors.. I totally get what you mean though.   Viki overall has pretty good subs. I really like how the subbers add translation notes which (correct me if I'm wrong), Dramafever doesn't do. They add cultural context to the drama and help understand the puns/references way better."
KDRAMA,3ccmme,SOUPY_BAGEL_VAG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"I use Netflix but Netflix has more movies than dramas. So I use either Viki or Hulu. Both of them has nice subtitles.

KDRAMA,3ccmme,kingmoose13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:59:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for all your suggestions. I do like Viki. I have a subscription to Drama Fever but rarely watch. Plus I like Viki since it does take a while to sub an episode, so I will test myself to see how much I understand. I have just noticed recently that some of the subs are wrong. Trying to get to the point where I will not need the subs. I know this will be way down the road though."
KDRAMA,3ccmme,blackstar_aria,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly the translations that you can download seemed the most accurate, but since d-addicts shut down their torrents... I too would suggest viki; if the subs are wrong someone will point it out in the comments thus you get a better experience. Depending on what you are looking for sites like epdrama, dramago, crunchyroll, asianrice ect will rip the subs from a sub groups website so you may find better subs than on drama fever. Hope this helps."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,bbaek,7,Mon Jul 6 11:23:10 2015 UTC,It's been 9 episodes now and I can't seem to like Joongi one bit.
KDRAMA,3cahpj,2milks,3,Tue Jul 7 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"I watched this actor in Discovery of Love and Jekyll, Hyde, Me. Both times he was one of the weaker performers. Seems like they could have picked any half-decent model and had the same performance."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,gatchaman_ken,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"He's so reserved compared with everyone else that its hard to tell what he's thinking.  I think his biggest motivation is helping his parents, which he wants to do by moving up the social/corporate ladder.  His previous relationship was purely for this purpose until he decided he could do better.    With Yoona I think he's trying to sort out his feelings.  She's kind of ideal for him because she is wealthy and genuinely a good person (good relationship with his mom too).  He's scared she'll leave him once she figures out that he always knew she was rich.  The longer he lies, the bigger the hole he's digging for himself.    I think we'll probably get a little more sympathy for him when we learn more about his relationship with Changsoo.  I have a feeling that Changsoo wasn't always a great friend and Joongi had to put up barriers."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,oGsMustachio,3,Tue Jul 7 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit behind... but honestly... I really really don't like Yoonha... she's so ignorant.. thinking that Joongi is the perfect guy and everything. It goes to show great writing and such when someone can be so irked by the plot, but ugh. I'm just waiting for the moment Yoonha gets her heart broken... i just can't get into the pairing... maybe if we never learned about his ulterior motives at the beginning."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,Uanaka,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think she was just blinded by love and the fact that ""he liked her without knowing her background"" so she wasn't able to sense the signs from Joonki. But now that she knows, I hope she uses her clever brain of hers to come up with some proper revenge (without hurting his parents pls). But cus it's typical dramaland, I feel like they'll both end up falling (legit) in love in the end hah"
KDRAMA,3cahpj,oGsMustachio,3,Wed Jul 8 09:43:49 2015 UTC,Episode 10  Oh shiiiiit.  Good episode... except for the weird edit of Wonderwall... and Changsoo standing in the shower with his shirt on...

KDRAMA,3cahpj,oGsMustachio,2,Thu Jul 9 01:45:41 2015 UTC,"I'm happy she finally found the key, that was bugging me but why did she have to tell Joongki all about it?   Speaking of him, it seems he's starting to realise he's falling (or already has fallen) for Yoonha simultaneously as she grows suspicious of him. Interesting.  But contrary to a lot of people I actually don't want a dramatic revenge plot between them, I'd love for them to become a power couple that overthrows Ye-won. But I guess that'd be too positive for a melodrama."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,sterretje_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will be revenge, it will be a dramatic breakup because she's going to learn about him knowing about her before Joongi tells her."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,Elnathan,2,Tue Jul 7 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"Well shit's about to go down. I would've liked if they found a way to avoid the clichéd revenge plot but it seems not.  Overall the episode was pretty good but I hope the next will focus less on the romance, which was a bit much this episode.  At this point I'm mostly anticipating when and how Kyung-joon is going to make his comeback. I mean, body not found, everything left behind so that it's perfectly convenient. Him being actually dead would be the biggest plot twist in recent K-drama history."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,Enter_Text_Here,2,Wed Jul 8 10:10:08 2015 UTC,"I liked how the bromance talked things out. Two guys being that vulnerable with each other is rare in dramas. I don't understand why Ji Yi goes to meet Chang Soo's mother, but that could be a cultural difference.  I don't like the preview for next week. The editing makes it look like they are about to ruin Yoona with a revenge plot. I'm all in for an Uee shower scene though. The cross cutting of dialogue and scene with JiYi and Changsoo on the bed was really cheesy. ""I might hurt you"" fuck off. We all saw Obsessed. We know shes not innocent. (And that's not when he says that line...)"
KDRAMA,3cahpj,Elnathan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"Meeting the mother is a cultural thing. Koreans are taught to respect elders, even if they're jerks. JiYi's character is the nice girl type and her personality probably wouldn't allow her refuse the invitation from an elder, even if she knew what was going to happen."
KDRAMA,3cahpj,Suuki_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:32:01 2015 UTC,Yoona and Joongi are like a reverse Beauty and The Beast type story. Changsoo and Jiyi's story is Chaebol Cinderella.  I was hoping for more shots fired this week. Get your guns people. You have all the ammo you need. Episode 10 - I believe in you!
KDRAMA,3cakhe,Targaryenxo,16,Mon Jul 6 12:00:01 2015 UTC,Male : Lee Min Ho  Doesn't possess much acting skills.  Uses his looks to get around. Plays the same kind of characters. I used to like him when I first got into kdramas but as I discovered better dramas I became very disappointed in his acting.   Female : Park Shin Hye  Similar to the reasons for Lee Min Ho. She always comes off as a pushover and whiny to me. I prefer strong female characters.
KDRAMA,3cakhe,Angie1314,28,Mon Jul 6 15:54:30 2015 UTC,So what I'm getting here is you enjoyed Heirs.

KDRAMA,3cakhe,Suuki_,2,Tue Jul 7 08:13:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on LMH. He's lovely to look at, but his acting is kinda emotionless. He reminds me of Kevin Costner that way. He'd make a good MC because he's charming."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,marjin,2,Tue Jul 7 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"He was too brooding in Heirs and BoF, uninteresting in Faith, i couldn't get into Personal Taste, but god damnit I love City Hunter.  He was perfect as Korean Batman."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,oGsMustachio,4,Tue Jul 7 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on Rain. I was completely mystified when he won the Best Actor vote on Dramafever. I think he's an amazing stage performer, but I really think he should stick to that. He's so boring to watch on screen."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,lynnb496,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"I've not seen Rain in a musical, so kpop thing. He's an incredible dancer.   I would love to see Shin Sung Rok in a musical! I saw a little bit of Monte Cristo with him singing. He's amazing."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,lynnb496,4,Mon Jul 6 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"hmmm, nothing against Hwang Jung Eum but i can't watch her. I just can't for some reason.  Park Shin Hye and Shin Se Kyung can not act. The other actors and the script has to be really fucking good for me to stomach the show for me to watch it."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,RyuNoKami,8,Tue Jul 7 04:22:46 2015 UTC,"For me, her SO, Lee Jong Suk. Same reason as yours."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,Enter_Text_Here,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"Same. There's just something that I dislike about him. Maybe I'm influenced by the rumors that he's really rude off camera, but his acting just irks me sometimes."

KDRAMA,3cakhe,cosmicolor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:28:51 2015 UTC,"Park Shin Hye, I just don't get the appeal and I don't see her so-called acting talent.

Not going to include various idol actors because most of them are just awful. There's a few really good ones and hardly any middle ground."
KDRAMA,3cakhe,sterretje_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:28 2015 UTC,Probably not completely fair to judge him based on one drama but I really disliked Yoo Yeon Seok from Warm and Cozy. Everything he said  just came across as petulant and whiny. One of the least likable male leads I've seen.

Cheese in the Trap isn't done casting, but I enjoyed the manhwa.     Oh! Who Are You/Hello, Monster has my attention right now. Seo In-guk plays that character really well, and the story hasn't gone off the rails. A bit early to tell, but it should be okay.  I remember Gu Family Book and King 2 Hearts GUTTED me back in the day when things were so new. But then again, I still get attached to characters."

KDRAMA,3c9kik,GrahamFlakes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:02:15 2015 UTC,I was interested in watching I remember you just cause I liked Seo In Guk so much in Reply 1997.

I do hope that my dad will manage to enjoy himself. He's a dedicated homebody and can be a grump on vacations."
KDRAMA,3c9kik,lynnb496,2,Mon Jul 6 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"Trying to organize a pretty last-minute weekend trip that was thrown together over the weekend with my friends and it's a pain to get things done promptly with a big group (let's say more than 5 people). Meanwhile good flight and accommodation deals are slipping through my fingers.. If the reasonable deals are gone, I don't think it'll be worth my while I'll have to back out of the trip. Sad face ;_____; because I need a break from work terribly.  A random thought: I enjoy blocking people on my Twitter feed who promote tweets or their own profiles where what they're promoting isn't something I'm interested in.  ~end of random thought~"

KDRAMA,3c9kik,cosmicolor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"Had a pretty fun couple of days last week! Went to see the Alexander McQueen at the V&A and it was AMAZING!!! An incredible exhibition, so happy I got to see it. Also went to see a Noel Coward play called ""Hayfever"" which was just hilarious. The only downside was that I was in London on the HOTTEST DAY EVER! I'm sorry, I'm British and I can't compute heat above ~25°C haha."
KDRAMA,3c9kik,rosecoconut,3,Tue Jul 7 19:01:15 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be 35°C tomorrow (well..back in Texas). NY has been similarly humid. I don't like it.

In Buffy, when Kendra, the 2nd slayer shows up, they act all surprised and have to talk out how there is a second slayer.  I would think that if a second slayer was called, all members of the council would be notified.  I mean isn't the entire Watcher's Council's sole purpose is to know about slayer stuff?  Why didn't Giles know there was another slayer?  And for that matter, why didn't Kendra's slayer know that Buffy was indeed alive?"

KDRAMA,3c66os,Uanaka,2,Sun Jul 5 13:21:53 2015 UTC,"The ending of episode 3 made me fall hard for our OTP. The moment he heard ""Won-a"", that dinner was over. I loved how his whole demeanor changed.   So Eun just started to get to know him (no past love) and it's obvious to her that he is in love with Ha-Na. She has serious skills when it comes to wooing men and i feel she sees Won as a challenge more than anything.   I sort of dont blame her because he entertains her come on's and is obviously attracted to her. I can imagine all his former attempts at dating had the other woman feeling like a third wheel with him and Hana!"
KDRAMA,3c66os,checkpoint_14,2,Mon Jul 6 20:42:33 2015 UTC,I love the way this show keeps showing flashbacks from Ha Na's POV first and then later Won's POV. It fools us into thinking we already know everything about their past and then reveals how there's always more than meets the eye. I wonder what is Won's motivation for hiding his love
KDRAMA,3c66os,peix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:01:17 2015 UTC,I'm a bit glad I'm coming into the show with no prior experience with the TW version. Usually I just get disappointed at remakes and such!
KDRAMA,3c66os,peix,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:32 2015 UTC,The TW version is fantastic though. Maybe the acting is a level below but the feels are definitely still there :-P  I'd recommend you try it after the KR version is over.
