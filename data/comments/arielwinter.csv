arielwinter,3cz9zd,HappyGoUnlucky,27,Sun Jul 12 03:27:37 2015 UTC,Somebody please please please photoshop him out of this
arielwinter,3cz9zd,Dent18,42,Sun Jul 12 07:24:03 2015 UTC,"Needles to say, my Photoshop skills are not good. And I'm lazy.  EDIT: Here's another one"
arielwinter,3cz9zd,elis8,10,Sun Jul 12 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"my Photoshop skills are not good   Oh, I disagree! Well done!"
arielwinter,3cz9zd,CaffeinatedBarbarian,3,Sun Jul 12 23:27:05 2015 UTC,Nice! The bear is a great touch.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,CBAFCMV,56,Sun Jul 12 23:15:38 2015 UTC,"Is it just me and jealousy, or does that guy look like a massive douche-bag?"
arielwinter,3cz9zd,ZhouLon,16,Sun Jul 12 08:11:14 2015 UTC,He could have at least smiled! Who wouldn't smile when they're getting a kiss from a good looking woman?
arielwinter,3cz9zd,2kungfu4u,6,Sun Jul 12 19:22:28 2015 UTC,He's got one of the most punchable faces I've ever seen.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,snorting_dandelions,-29,Tue Jul 14 15:37:26 2015 UTC,"It's a fit dude with a nice haircut and a hot chick on his side, of course most people on here are going to think he's a douchebag; those things are basically the only criteria you have to fulfill to be labelled a d-bag around here."
arielwinter,3cz9zd,iiztrollin,31,Sun Jul 12 14:36:58 2015 UTC,That's a good haircut?
arielwinter,3cz9zd,snorting_dandelions,-3,Sun Jul 12 16:56:13 2015 UTC,Sure beats a neckbeard.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,CBAFCMV,5,Sun Jul 12 17:31:47 2015 UTC,as well as a giant cross necklace and greased hair.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,Loire55,4,Sun Jul 12 16:47:12 2015 UTC,That's not in the slightest bit greasy. Most dudes who make an attempt at looking good run some gel/paste through their hair for styling.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,snorting_dandelions,-10,Sun Jul 12 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you want him to be a d-bag in your fantasy, just say so instead of asking silly questions"
arielwinter,3cz9zd,CaffeinatedBarbarian,-3,Sun Jul 12 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"That is not a good haircut. What makes him a douchebag is that he is taking a nice picture with his girl and he his more concerned with looking ""cool"" (according to whatever rules for cool he has) in a self centered way. A non-douchbag (or douchevag if it was a woman) would be highlighting the SO or the pair instead of just themselves."
arielwinter,3cz9zd,snorting_dandelions,10,Sun Jul 12 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"JFC you gotta be trolling. Have you ever been laid in your life?  Dude's looking at the camera in a single picture, that obviously means he's a self-centered douche, and even more importantly: he's not putting her on a pedastal! Oh, how could I not have noticed that.  Maybe the photographer wanted them to look that way. Maybe she wanted him to look like that in the picture. Maybe they have another picture where she's looking into the camera while he is kissing her cheek. There's probably another dozen reasons not to judge that person for a single picture.  Anyone who seriously believes that dude is a douchebag from that single picture is a way bigger douchebag than that guy in the picture could ever be."
arielwinter,3cz9zd,CaffeinatedBarbarian,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:52:17 2015 UTC,I call 'em like I see 'em. If he wants to not look like a douche than don't get pictures taken where you look like one. The reasons he might not be one are irrelevant. It's not like I will interact with him in RL and have to actually have to concern myself with who the real person is. It's the Internet. Wear a cup.
arielwinter,3cz9zd,SumNut,9,Mon Jul 13 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"Buddy should get giant prints of these pictures framed, because Ariel looks fantastic in them.  Damn, who wouldn't kill for that kind of attention from her"
arielwinter,3cz9zd,superLadyboy,2,Sun Jul 12 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"It pains me to say this... it really does... but, I wish I was that guy instead of myself."
arielwinter,3cz9zd,BamaFan87,4,Mon Jul 13 11:59:26 2015 UTC,That dress is too long!

arielwinter,3cxigl,MattAdams53,3,Sat Jul 11 17:38:44 2015 UTC,I know gross! Look at the kneecap on that pig!
arielwinter,3cxigl,BamaFan87,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:06:28 2015 UTC,"You do know I'm talking about the actual pig... Ariel Winter is for sure in my top 10 Starlets and I would never say anything bad about her.  Edit: When post was at 33% upvoted...  (1 upvote, 3 downvotes)"
