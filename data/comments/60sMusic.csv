60sMusic,3dx619,ander3jc,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think the book I'm using calculates the top 20's month by month, based not only on their chart position but how long they were on the chart. So yeah it did get to number 2, but in August."

60sMusic,3dn9d0,Admiral37,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:54 2015 UTC,were you reading Dr Sleep today as well?
60sMusic,3dn9d0,original_greaser_bob,2,Fri Jul 17 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"No, why do you ask?  It just popped into my head on the way to work today and was in my head all morning long."
60sMusic,3dn9d0,original_greaser_bob,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:56 2015 UTC,It's mentioned in Dr Sleep specifically the piano break. As its not as well known as most Beatles songs and I had just read about it earlier in the day I figured my Baader-Meinhof was kicking in.

60sMusic,3cm64o,atticus138,3,Thu Jul 9 00:03:44 2015 UTC,Beneath the blue suburban sky's... Beautiful song.

I know that you may think that I'm a wing-nut after I explain why it was so important to me to post this song today.  In a horrible turn of events and timing I ""heard"" a little goat being ""dispatched"" this morning so that it could be ""smoked and served"" later today by people who live very close to me...It's a ""community"" thing and something that I will not be a part of.  I will never un-hear those terrible sounds....and I dedicate this song to that poor little creature."
60sMusic,3c2hbo,atticus138,2,Sat Jul 4 03:42:07 2015 UTC,Some sad person is going through the music subs DVing everything. What a waste of time. We have so many real music lovers. Isn't it great?
60sMusic,3bfttn,Admiral37,2,Sun Jun 28 21:12:34 2015 UTC,Excellent!
60sMusic,3b8zve,philliplennon,2,Fri Jun 26 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"This song is Lennon/McCartney, I believe."
60sMusic,3b51iz,Admiral37,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"The guitars really stand out, both the lead and the fingerpicking. It's still hard to believe Ringo didn't play drums on Prudence as he temporarily left the group at the time of the recording in August '68."
60sMusic,3b51iz,MyTravelClips,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:58:54 2015 UTC,TIL that's not Ringo on drums

60sMusic,3akhkj,leanstotheleftabit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"I can't find the exact release date of this song, as so much of Cambodian culture was destroyed by the Khmer Rouge.  But this song is a good introduction to Cambodian surf rock, which flourished for a brief but exciting time in the 1960s and early 70s. Ros Sereysothea was last seen in Phnom Penh as Khmer Rouge forces began entering the city.  It is rumored she was executed in 1977, or starved to death like two million others, but after 1975 she was never heard from again."
60sMusic,3ah1pr,atticus138,2,Sat Jun 20 02:46:18 2015 UTC,I had no idea this was a cover for Blondie until this moment. Thanks!
60sMusic,3ah1pr,decorama,2,Sat Jun 20 11:42:34 2015 UTC,"My FAVORITE version of this song.... I do like Blondie's cover, but this is so much more soulful... real musical instruments, too... no sunthesizers, etc. Organic!!!"
60sMusic,3acixp,billy_bob_hambone,3,Fri Jun 19 00:13:38 2015 UTC,I seem to be the only person ever to consider this my favorite song on the album.
60sMusic,3a47ns,Admiral37,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:35:24 2015 UTC,Excellent song.  Though I really wish I knew how they made that guitar sound like a sitar.
