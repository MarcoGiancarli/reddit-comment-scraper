Standard operating equipment, that.     On a more serious note, no, it is not usual, except in mythos where dragons are cooperating with elves or dwarves and sometimes have plating made for them by those other races.

Also, try not to go overboard with linear gradients when using vector drawing tools as it makes your art look very artificial and as if not a lot of work went into it, despite how many hours may (or may not) have gone into your work.  Finally, while I personally prefer a raster editor for everything except cleanup, they usually don't mix well with anything other than a pressure-sensitive tablet. Your work as it is looks like it was done with very careful use of a mouse in mspaint, so vector tools would make that process 100x less frustrating as fixing mistakes is then just the simple matter of moving a node on a curve or two.

Also, Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series is amazing.  E.E. Knight has a series called The Age of Fire, and some of the antagonists are dragon riders who have basically enslaved dragons.  Piers Anthony's Xanth series with all kinds of mythical and magical creatures, some of which are mounts.  Carrie Vaughn has a book called Voices of Dragons that is about a young woman and a dragon.  Dragonhaven by Robin McKinley has dragons in Australia, with companionship happening.  Robin Hobb has numerous books, some of which involve dragons and their keepers/riders.  And I think L.

It's a different take on the concept and if you are interested in dragon riders in warfare it is a definite read.  I also agree with all of blackdays recommendations.
dragons,35vpqb,LogicalShrapnel,1 point,Thu May 14 10:48:54 2015 UTC,"/u/blackday44 has a good list going there. I'll add a few.  If you didn't already know, A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) features dragon riders. Haven't gotten to much actual riding as of book 5, but there is a ton of ""history"" about the Dragonriders in The World of Ice & Fire, which is like a full history of the ASOIAF universe.  Mercedes Lackey has a ton of books about dragons. I loved the Halfblood Chronicles, but was pretty young when I read them. Not positive how they hold up."

dragons,340ghy,F4cele55,6,Mon Apr 27 09:18:17 2015 UTC,"1  Human. I don't like the idea of impersonating a dragon, unless it was done exceptionally well and to date there are no games that accomplished this that I'm aware of. There are a host of issues animating dragon models in convincing enough manner, from what I read on the subject.   Also, for the record I would also like to mention that I hate the very idea of shapeshifting (there are great many mythos wherein dragons are able to shapeshift to humans).  2  Look, the games can be categorized in to two main types (for our purposes at hand):    Multiplayer PvP games, where gamers basically create their own content and immersion is not really relevant Singleplayer RPG games, where immersion is the game   Stay away from multiplayer games, unless you have a VERY good idea of what you’re doing and your team have VERY good technical backgrounds in all relevant areas. Suffice to say, many multimillion dollar companies are consistently failing to provide multiplayer experience worth a damn.   RPG game is a different beast. Immersion makes or breaks the game. Your game might have inferior mechanics, but if it has a very good story with just enough action and twists to back it up, it will do fine. That means you need a good storyline, very good characters and very minute attention to detail. None of which is easy.  3  Real dragons, the way I imagine them, are inseparably connected to arcane. A dragon is the most powerful mortal being capable of manipulating arcane energies. I place only demon lords and demigods on the same or higher level than mature dragons and even then with caveats (not all creatures use same types of magic and not all types of magic can be compared directly).  Dragon is a natural creature. It was not created by anyone. It is, however, an ancient species, much older than any other living race.   Under normal circumstances dragons are mortal, with a lifespan of a few hundred years. Nearly indestructible demigod dragon sorcerers who were old when the rocks on Earth were young do not fall under “normal circumstances”.  4  Dragons are neither “evil” nor “good”, just like humans. There might be feral dragons who generally kill everything that enters their territory, there might be truly wicked dragons with insidious goals, just as there might be dragon kings justly ruling over entire kingdoms or hermit sages living in the edges of a universe, sharing their knowledge with any who might arouse their interest.   5  Mature dragon is vastly intelligent, far more so than any human.   Dragons do not talk, they are just not equipped for that what with their mighty jaws and the general lack of these flexible lips of ours. As masters of arcane (which is just a manipulation of various energy forms) they can project their thoughts directly to the conversant, barring some serious mental barriers or some really strange life forms, that just don’t exist in a way we do (ethereal beings, for example).   I have nothing against talking dragons, though. As everything, it depends on your mythos.   6  I am not in to virtual reality. The technology is not there yet. As such, I’d much rather prefer a good game in a conventional screen. The screen in my home, to be precise.   7  The days where you were unable to customize your character are long gone, I would think. It would be a serious disadvantage being unable to customize your character at least to some extent.   8  Western."
dragons,340ghy,Dragoniel,2,Mon Apr 27 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"May be a little biased as a furry with a dragon sona. Id like to be a dragon, not the rider. Immersion is nice. Dragons are as magical as we are. Yes, they do die. Just like you and I, not all are evil. Speech would probably be a thing and intelligence like ours. As a scaley, yeah, customization and relating to the character. I prefer a western dragon like my sona."

Dragons are way more awesome if they aren't just always evil I'd say very intelligent and able to speak (in some way at least), it gives them a personality and makes the game more engaging. I wish something like that existed where I lived :( Usually I don't really care about customizing my character too much, but VR makes a big difference there Western dragons are my favourite   PS: I really hope this project takes off, I tried to make someting like this in my free time, but a game like this is really too much for a single person. Good luck!"

dragons,340ghy,MissingFish,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the late response,   Definitely would rather be a dragon, just the kind of experience that would provide would be unique. Riding one would be just as amazing.  I would say personally immersion is important to me, but it is not hard for me to become immersed in a game. I usually see dragons as both natural and magical in nature. Traditional folklore put a dragon's abilities nothing short of magical, but also traditional folklore demands the dragon's die by the hands of knights in shining armor, meaning they have to at least be mortal. In terms of VR, it would definitely help immersion if the dragons looked like something that was possible in real life, and didn't have unrealistic proportions. I personally find dragons akin with humans, meaning they can be both good and evil. On the one hand English dragons tended to be portrayed as evil, princess kidnapping kinds, where as in Chinese lore dragons were usually benevolent spirits bringing fertility to farmers. Dragons don't always have to talk, but if you want them to interact with humans (or other sentient creatures) in the story, speech definitely helps the coherence of the story. Usually dragons are portrayed just as smart as humans, though again human intelligence varies widely, so their intelligence could also vary along with personality. It wouldn't be nearly as convenient, but I might consider going to another location if the experience was truly immersive. Customization always helps the user with immersion, as it helps the user feel like they are playing 'themselves' in the story. Personally i prefer western style dragons (4 legs, 2 wings), but in terms of VR, wyvern (2 legs, 2 wings) might be easier."

dragons,2vubba,BUMDY,1 point,Sat Feb 14 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"Ouroboros:       The Ouroboros or Uroboros (/jʊərɵˈbɒrəs/; /ɔːˈrɒbɔrəs/, from the Greek οὐροβόρος ὄφις tail-devouring snake) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail.  The Ouroboros often symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things such as the phoenix which operate in cycles that begin anew as soon as they end. It can also represent the idea of primordial unity related to something existing in or persisting from the beginning with such force or qualities it cannot be extinguished. While first emerging in Ancient Egypt, the Ouroboros has been important in religious and mythological symbolism, but has also been frequently used in alchemical illustrations, where it symbolizes the circular nature of the alchemist's opus. It is also often associated with Gnosticism, and Hermeticism.  Carl Jung interpreted the Ouroboros as having an archetypal significance to the human psyche.  The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann writes of it as a representation of the pre-ego ""dawn state"", depicting the undifferentiated infancy experience of both mankind and the individual child.

dragons,2vqz95,Dracovitch,1 point,Sat Feb 14 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points, but... I still loved it <3  Honestly, just give me good dragon CGI & action sequences and I'm satisfied.  Yeah, an amazing story (like the first one) would be nice, but that iconic theme music makes literally anything moving.  :P  Thanks for posting this thread, or I would have never found out they made a third one.  Plus it's already on Netflix instant!"
dragons,2vqz95,sim9,1 point,Sat Feb 14 07:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a huuuuge fan of the original Dragonheart. Draco was the dragon that really helped cement my love for dragons when I was young. I remember seeing the second one and while it isn't very good, I think it might have been better than the third (haven't seen the second film in many years). I actually sat through that thing and I thought it was pretty bad. I think I could go on and on about the things that bugged me; you definitely hit a few of them. Drago's design was pretty good, but he was missing the warmth that Draco had. They made actually his face too reptilian, and it resulted in stiffer facial expressions. Not to mention the lip movements are over-exaggerated in some parts and don't reflect normal speech.  The effort was clearly there, but there was so much weirdness with the magic that made everything too complicated. It really makes the movie suffer even more aside from flat, uninspired or over-the-top acting, awkward dialogue, and just in general what-the-heck-is-this-film syndrome. It also tries hard to call back to the first with unnecessary references that just seem silly."

dragons,2vmjjl,steven2194,1 point,Fri Feb 13 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"I watched it last night.  ==== Spoilers below ====    Facts I learned from watching this movie:   Dragons come from space and can survive vacuum, atmospheric reentry and crashing. Dragons have gold on their skin and eggs. Dragon females give eggs to random male dragons. Dragons bring eggs to Earth from space to serve mankind. Dragons have armored testicles. (Yeah.) Dragon eggs explode if shaken. Dragons are okay with using dragon eggs as grenades despite having carried them across space to get here. Dragons are affected by human druidic moon magic despite coming from another planet. Something something Romans something Picts something druids. Merlin was the first druid. Hadrian's wall is 10 meters tall and made of stone. There is only one place to cross Hadrian's wall.   The movie is as bad as you'd expect, but it didn't have to be. The acting was acceptable for the most part, the sets were decent, the CGI was fine. The plot was utterly predictable but most movies are. The problem is there was a lot in the script that was contrived and didn't need to be there (shadowjumping? where the fuck did that come from?) and things left too unexplained (dragons come from outer space?)  All that said, I think it was better than the second movie."

dragons,2uvz5f,Lord_Vinton,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:46:34 2015 UTC,"There is also no way that Shenlong (and where is Porunga?) is smaller than the Skyrim dragons, and possibly a few others. I believe that 30m is wrong but I cant find any sources to dispute it, I also cant find any that actually say 30m. Any shot you see him in with a human (granted it is always from an altered perspective, ground looking up) you can tell he is much larger than the Skyrim dragons, which are only about 2-3 times taller than the Dovahkiin. If a Skyrim dragon were standing on the ground the dovahkiin has no problems reaching it's neck, there is no way it is 45m.  Edit: the only site I could find that talked about the reasoning behind these choices doesn't even talk about DBZ and Skyrim dragons. It gives reasons for the others and glances over these controversial ones. They also take the film's version of Smaug over the book version...so...I don't know if I really trust it."

dragons,2tyb7a,RobbyLee,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"you have a very nice technique, but the dragon looks awkward. I don't know how one ""learns"" to draw new things but I used pictures of others, compared them and tried to find similarities.  The front legs of your dragon are SO thin and that doesn't seem to fit with a dragon. Dragons are described as huge, powerful, mystical creatures, strogn in stomping enemies, they have to catch their fall even when they can't land too softly, especially in fight.  I don't think those long, thin legs seem fit. Even horses have stronger legs.  And again, besides that, your art style is very nice, I like it :)"

Dragonsbane by Barbara Hambly, I remember liking the dragon in - although you're best cautioned to tread carefully around the following two sequels, which are disliked by many who liked the first. I also want to re-read the Ultimate Dragon Saga by Graham Edwards, which starts with Dragoncharm, and has all-dragon protagonists. It's out of print now, but the author is working on an ebook re-release."

dragons,2o6s9a,dragonzoo,7,Wed Dec 3 20:35:29 2014 UTC,"Immediately have to discount this list as it says that Eragon was a good movie.  It was an okay book, but the movie was horrible."
dragons,2o6s9a,Draconilian,3,Wed Dec 3 20:47:13 2014 UTC,Honestly most movies here are sub par. This list is fairly comprehensive though
dragons,2o6s9a,Zaiush,3,Wed Dec 3 21:28:03 2014 UTC,"i think ive seen about 3/4ths that list, maybe a little more. Most of the tv series nope. Blue dragon wasnt really a dragon show though, the main characters shadow/weapon was a dragon but it wasnt really a dragon tv show imo. Good videogaame though. Theres a fair amount of dragon including things they dont list. But hey, no biggie. If its your site, list them chronologically, it would flow better probably. Also the never ending story has dragons in all 3 of them as well as the animated show that aired. Side note, in the 2nd one he summons a standard looking dragon prior to realizing hes and idiot and calling forth falcor."

dragons,2o6s9a,Dragoniel,0,Wed Dec 3 20:58:33 2014 UTC,"Fun fact - ""Eragon"" was the last movie I have ever watched in cinema. It killed the part of my soul that cared for movies.   The only way you could maybe possibly consider the movie anything other than the epitome of book-mangling brutality, is if you never read the Inheritance Cycle. Which is a crime on its own, you know."

dragons,2kdmuq,SkyUraeus,2,Sun Oct 26 23:06:46 2014 UTC,"DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT ANIMATRONIC PIKACHUS. I got one once. It was one of the ones that made sounds when you pet it. It would go ""aah"" or ""pika pika!"" and its cheeks would light up and it would move its arms when you put your hand on its head. So, when I got it, I put batteries in, turned it on, and pet its head. Nothing happened, until I took my hand away. Then the characteristic ""pika pika!"" and flashing cheeks. I thought that was weird, but assumed it just didn't work.  When I went to bed at night, suddenly I heard a muffled ""aah"". I looked up at the pikachu. After a while the cheeks started flashing, and it shouted ""pika!"" This was really fucking creepy. This continued to happen, both night and day, until I got my parents to turn it off.  So, lying in my bed, sure I'd be able to sleep, I heard a strange sound. I realized it was the sound of the pikachu's arms moving, and I looked up. Its cheeks were flashing and it made several ""pika""'s. I pretty much ran upstairs to my parents' room and slept there, totally freaked out.  In the morning we checked the switch and it was in fact set to ""off"". No idea how the fuck this happened, but it must have turned itself on somehow. My parents unscrewed the bottom and took the batteries out. Now it was just a harmless pikachu doll, right?  Well guess what fucking happened. That night the cheeks lit up, the pikachu was yelling ""pika pika!"" and ""aah"". Whatever the hell was making it still work, however, didn't work very well, so the voice got more and more distorted, until it was a deep, demonic tone.  So yeah. We threw that shit out.

dragons,2e2arc,Denaro,5,Wed Aug 20 14:15:09 2014 UTC,"There are heroic dragons, like Draco from Dragonheart, that acts honorably to find himself a place among his deceased fellows at the stars.  There are clever dragons like Toothless that act playfully, making others laugh at their antics.  There are ones like Charizard that would be your partner for travels in other worlds, sharing your aspirations and being loyal and steadfast companions when you're away from home.  There are wise ones like Paarthunax, that guide you to better understand yourself and remind you what's most important: To overcome your faults and become a better person.  Then there are those brutal dragons like Glaurung, that with their might bring destruction and despair over those undeserving of their attention but nevetheless make mighty foes to great heroes.  It's hard to choose because dragons are just as varied as humans. From the smallest Faerie Dragon to the largest Great Wyrm, very often we see qualities that make them incredible creatures that live in our dreams that inspire us in many different ways. It's just like asking ""What is your favorite person"".  But poetics aside, honorable mention to very sensible Deucalion from The Dark Lord of Derkholm, to very deep character Temeraire, and to all dragons from Greyhawk/Forgotten Realms that I had the pleasure to meet or create."

Originally implemented for C and C++, the language-agnostic design (and the success) of LLVM has since spawned a wide variety of front ends: languages with compilers that use LLVM include ActionScript, Ada, D, Fortran, OpenGL Shading Language, Haskell, Java bytecode, Julia, Objective-C, Swift, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala,  and C#.

Chances are, you have probably already seen this wonderful creation on the internet some time before. You would make it similar to this. Although if I had preference I would rather have the tail and wings be actual pieces, not just flat pieces of cloth... If you get what I mean by that.  Cosplaying is in a league of its own. Assuming you are an experienced cosplayer, or know someone who is then you should probably go for an anthropomorphic version of toothless, which would totally work and and be the easiest path.  If you do eventually decide to do a cosplay, I would love to see it. I'm sure Toothless will love it too"

I have however not spent a cent and it is still playable and fun, you just have to be quite patient.  In a side note, finish the easy crystal giving quests such as having 500 friends (go on Google plus group and add everyone). And avoid spending crystals on speeding things up."

dragons,26gv11,BlakDrgn,4,Sun May 25 21:11:29 2014 UTC,"Okay, I'll bite.  Tell me what you can about the anatomy of a dragons wing.  How does it maintain it's structure?   I've read several theories from humans and they always amuse me.    Do you believe like Anne McCaffrey that an array of batten ribs give it structure? Or are you of the group that thinks the facia alone should be enough to have it hold under the forced applied, and that the wings are just skin.  Maybe you've studied some bioengineering and you believe that in dragons, like in bats, that an array of aligned collagen fibers work to keep the wing firm in flight."
dragons,26gv11,IAMA-Dragon-AMA,3,Mon May 26 00:33:11 2014 UTC,"Oh hey, you're here too :D  Since ya ama as well, what kinda dragon are you?"

dragons,26gv11,Throwaway56260,2,Mon May 26 02:04:27 2014 UTC,I am not sure. There is no doubt that ir would gove a certain amount ofglory killing such a magnificent beast. But if inwere a knight i would be trying to avoid dragons
dragons,26gv11,IAMA_dragon-AMA,2,Mon May 26 05:08:03 2014 UTC,"Piles of gold and riches which some dragons hoard almost compulsively, are probably a large factor, but primarily the fact that some dragons have been known to consume whole villages, can put townspeople at unease if they knew there was a dragon nearby.   In such cases, the leader of the town usually commands a knight (or commissions from elsewhere if they don't have any) to rid them of their ""problem"". Even if the dragon in question never had the inclination to attack the town, the actions of a terrible few, affect the reputations of all dragons."
dragons,26gv11,Dragoniel,2,Mon May 26 05:19:03 2014 UTC,"Whole villages? One or two humans is well enough a meal, but I guess things have been a little exaggerated."
dragons,26gv11,teryxc,2,Mon May 26 10:46:08 2014 UTC,"Dragons eat. Being dragons, dragons are big and they tend to eat a lot (though they usually don't need to eat every day). Humans need to eat as well, and to this extent they keep herds of animals near their villages and cities. Do you see where it comes together?   If a big hungry dragon eats six sheep, farmers get restless and angry and they start complaining. Eventually a farmer ends up in a castle, militia gets alerted, realising they can't deal with it, they inform a local lord, which in turn - regent and eventually a King gets notified of the issue. So he orders his mightiest knights to deal with it.   And thus one day a poor dragon finds an angry group of jingling men in front of his abode, shouting and shaking sticks at him."

dragons,261gd3,Username0010,12,Tue May 20 16:13:16 2014 UTC,"They might all be called Dragons, but eastern and western dragons are different enough to be considered separate mythological creatures. They only share the name because of translation conventions.  Western dragons tended to be large, scaly creatures that breath fire, have bat-like wings and tended to be antagonistic towards humans. Until Tolkien, most weren't intelligent creatures, as they were seen as simple-minded monsters. In Christianity, they were often considered servants of the underworld due to their pagan origins.  Eastern dragons vary in size and appearance. They were usually benign or at least neutral towards humans, only attacking when provoked. They were usually embodied spirits of animistic nature or patron gods. If you remember Haku from Spirited Away, he's the spirit of a river. And they were certainly very intelligent.  So you can see they are nothing alike."
dragons,261gd3,EmeraldScales,4,Tue May 20 18:16:36 2014 UTC,"I personally think that it was what early men thought fossils were.  If I came across a giant thigh bone I would recognise it as belonging to a large animal, and imagination would take care of the rest."
dragons,261gd3,Matnaloj,3,Tue May 20 20:38:41 2014 UTC,"This is something I've thought also. I can only imagine how mind blowing it would have been to someone to see ancient fossilized bones of a creature several times his size.  One thing that seems to make sense to me is with little or no understanding of the nature of atmospheric conditions, how do you explain lightning and thunder? Well a flying fire breathing creature of course."

dragons,261gd3,DragonMeme,3,Tue May 20 18:01:09 2014 UTC,"Still, they're winged beasts associated with elements, and the ideas have been seen across the world from places as isolated as Japan all the way to Europe and the middle-east?"
dragons,261gd3,DragonMeme,2,Tue May 20 18:14:12 2014 UTC,"Actually, most Asian dragons don't have wings traditionally. And Japan was by no means isolated, they had lots of contact with the continent and arguably were much more cultured sooner than most of Europe. Also, a huge number of mythological creatures are associated with elements.  It's also possible that the silk road could have played a role in some cross-cultural references between the far East and the West."

What a nice little human girl she was, offering herself like that! All garnished neatly with flowers, too, thought the dragon as it flew off towards the mountains, perhaps to lay upon its great hoard and contemplate trying to coax out more delicious  human girls. Who knows, it might even get a princess or two! The dragon liked that idea, and it felt all warm throughout as it drifted off into sleep, curled up and somewhat buried beneath the mountain of glittering treasure hidden deep within the cave."

Examples include depicting deities with human form and ascribing human emotions or motives to forces of nature, such as hurricanes or earthquakes.  Anthropomorphism has ancient roots as a literary device in storytelling, and also in art. Most cultures have traditional fables with anthropomorphised animals, which can stand or talk like humans, as characters.  The word anthropomorphism was first used in the mid-1700s.   The word derives from the Greek ἄνθρωπος (ánthrōpos), ""human"", and μορφή (morphē), ""shape"" or ""form"".
