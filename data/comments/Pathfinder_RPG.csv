Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,Equinox90,14,Tue Jul 21 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"Have you considered the Phalanx Soldier fighter archetype? It is centered entirely around spear+shield combat, even allowing for use of any polearm/spear (of your size category) with one hand while using a shield, so you'll be able to keep the damage of a 2handed weapon (and reach) while still using a shield.  If you build for int 13 to go the combat expertise route (for combat maneuver feats) you'll get an extra skill point per level out of the deal, which will help you build up skills for out of combat utility."
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,MagnumNopus,3,Tue Jul 21 13:17:16 2015 UTC,i've always liked this. Build decent Dex and pick up the TWF tree and sheild bash. letting you attack (and knock back) people inside your spear range.
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,ADDandy,10,Tue Jul 21 18:44:24 2015 UTC,"I feel that archetype suffers from throwing away weapon training. I've considered it, it just doesn't seem worth it. At 4th level I'd be doing 1d8 dmg from weapon. With warpriest I'd be hitting for 1d8 from level 1 with a short spear."
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,ChLoRo8523,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, the size of the die you roll doesn't make a huge difference later on. The damage progression for a medium warpriest goes d6,d8,d10,2d6, and finally 2d8 at level 20. At level 1 through 4 you're doing the same damage with a shortspear, no matter what class you are.   From level 10 to 14 as a warpriest, you're doing 1d10 damage; an average of maybe 1 more point of damage per round (vs a 1d8 spear you'd be using as a phalanx soldier). It's pretty much negligible. At that point most of your damage should be coming from enchantments or static bonuses that can multiply on critical hits.  It really comes down to if you want higher BAB, the feats, and the host of defensive abilities that the phalanx soldier has to offer, or the spellcasting of the warpriest. As a phalanx fighter you can also swap to a bardiche, a 1d10, 19-20 weapon, and use it with a tower shield.  Another option, depending on how you want to play the character, is swashbuckler with a Shortspear and buckler. Shortspear is a 1 handed piercing weapon, you've got full bab, and your precise strike will add your level to damage. You get Incremental bonuses to attack and damage, qualify as a fighter for weapon Specialization, etc, and have a handful of nifty deeds"
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,ChLoRo8523,0,Tue Jul 21 14:21:50 2015 UTC,That's a very compelling argument. I'm going to do some theorycrafting and see where I end up. But I'm going to heavily consider atleast 4 levels in Phalanx
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2g0y,Hoplophobia,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more about it and you could probably pull off a Slayer build also. Full BAB, d10 HD, 6+ skill points per level. With your skills you're a natural scout, plus knowledge local helps EVERYWHERE, especially out of combat. Bluff is also a class skill, and even with a poor charisma a Mask of Stony Demeanor could make you a decent liarface (+14 to lie with only 1 skill rank invested).  As for combat, you can roll with a ranger combat style to avoid prerequisites. While sword and board is probably the most apt of the preexisting ones, you might be able to discuss a custom ""spear and shield"" loadout with your GM as long as it's reasonable. You can then tweak your combat tactics with rogue and ninja talents (which means you can also be a trapfinder!) Any other additional out of combat skills you want can probably be supplemented with traits.   Edit: Some feats to think about in a custom loadout would probably include power attack, cleave, or third party shaft and shield, while at 6th level you could go with Spear Dancer or weapon specialization, or something. Most of my play is in the PFS arena, so ultimately homebrew stuff really comes down to your GM. If your character has a military background, I could see combat oriented feats being pretty fitting in a ""spear and shield combat style"" loadout."

Pathfinder_RPG,3e2my9,dnahacker13,4,Tue Jul 21 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"Normally you have resistance to all 4, and an sheath your arms in 1 of the 4 every time you use the elemental assault. With that trait, you get resistance to only 2, and can only use those 2 elements with elemental assault, but you can sheath one hand in one and the other hand in the other."
Pathfinder_RPG,3e2my9,Ljosalf_of_Alfheim,3,Tue Jul 21 14:37:21 2015 UTC,"Poorly.  That's how it works.  The answer is ultimately: ""Ask your DM""  Personally, I would rule that you can't take both.  Or more accurately, the specifics of Energy Strike (I assume you meant this options) over ride the specifics of Dualborn.  So you only get 1 elemental type for resists and only one of the strikes.  Why? Because it would be terrible munchkinry to do otherwise."

Pathfinder_RPG,3e1l2i,zupernam,12,Tue Jul 21 06:40:26 2015 UTC,"Read the errata on Titan Mauler.    Can a Medium titan mauler wield a Large two-handed weapon, such as a Large greatsword?  No. The ""Inappropriately Sized Weapons"" rule says (in summary) that a creature can't wield an inappropriately-sized weapon if the size difference would increase it one or more ""steps"" beyond ""two-handed."" None of the titan mauler's abilities say the character can break the ""steps"" part of the ""Inappropriately Sized Weapons"" rule, so the character still has to follow that rule.   You cant wield a Huge-sized two handed weapon unless you're huge sized in the first place.  The only thing the Titan Mauler can do it wield  a weapon that it sized (as in the hilt is bigger for a larger creature) for a larger creature but that is small enough that he can still use it (like a giants long sword). A giants greatsword can't be wielded by a medium sized creature as it is too large to use."

Pathfinder_RPG,3e1l2i,TeddyR3X,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm using the re-errata'd RAI version of Titan Mauler:  Massive Weapons (Ex): At 3rd level, a titan mauler becomes skilled in the use of massive weapons looted from her titanic foes. This allows her to use weapons designed for creatures larger than her size, always treating them as two-handed weapons and applying a cumulative -2 penalty on attack rolls per size category of difference. The total attack roll penalty is reduced by 1, and this reduction increases by 1 for every three levels beyond 3rd (to a minimum of 0). This ability replaces trap sense.
