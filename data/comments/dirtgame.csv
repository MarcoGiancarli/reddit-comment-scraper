dirtgame,3drwyu,Agentofsociety,3,Sat Jul 18 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"I went for the cheapest engineers with the best points in Radiator and Wheels since those were the components taking the most damage when I was learning. Total cost of them is about 2k CR per stage and reached rating of 69 with all perks unlocked.   Right now it's pretty rare for them not to be able repair everything up to 100% since I don't take that much damage anymore. I don't see the point in any of the more expensive engineers, they're just money sinks for me. You get a lot more value from cheap engineers early on to save money and focus on maxing out perks to upgrade cars faster."
dirtgame,3drwyu,QuitoPR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:51 2015 UTC,That's a good strategy! I have the most expensive enginneers at a rating of 78 and keeping them on contract is just so expensive!
dirtgame,3drwyu,irokdayellup,2,Sat Jul 18 23:40:05 2015 UTC,There are certain Engineers that give you 5+ extra stages per extension and have more green stats for the same price as a lower one. Just keep looking and you can compare and find a good one. Sometimes a good one isnt available.     Over time you will save money and get better value. Not having to extend as often. I purchased engineers at 75 75 65 65. I upgraded the lowers to 70 70 recently. My main master is lvl 6. I am now at 75 overall team score.     *Edit - Its also worth noting my overall damage average in my profile is 4%. So i am not crashing or doing tons of damage on average.

dirtgame,3dv0yo,TheAdmiester,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:25:46 2015 UTC,RBR NGP 3.0 and good car settings is best. Dirt rally feels to arcade and car weight is like Scania truck. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aK3U3Aewpo&index=30&list=WL I think you dont have proper wheel settings in RBR.
dirtgame,3dv0yo,Jackigg,-12,Tue Jul 21 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the cars feel kind of light in RBR (at least thats what I think you meant), but my main gripe is with the grip on different surfaces. Thats where Dirt falls short in my opinion. The breaking distances are objectively (not only subjectively) too short on surfaces like gravel and ice.   I have to drive in my private time through mud/dirt and gravel and can really say that if you have to do a harsh break you will need longer to come to a full stop than Dirt would make you think. From my own experience I would say neither game is completely realistic but RBR is far more so."

In my opinion you simply MUST NOT complain when you buy early access games. You see it, you want it, you're being informed what early access is and the developers tell you what is happening in the game right now and what is not.

You guys are by far the most community-involved developers I've seen for years, this is what the gaming community really needs, more devs like you. Just one question, I know I've hammered you guys with this question over and over again, but here it goes.  Will DiRT Rally have mod support?  Even if it's not a top priority feature, I just want to know if you'll consider it. From a long term aspect, this would be a tremendous feature. (once again) Look at Richard Burns Rally, you can still buy it from www.ukgamesplanet.com, (which is the only website that offers a digital download of it). As of right now, it's the 9th best selling game on their website! (up there with the likes of GTA V, Civilization V, and Black Ops II) After selling copies for over a DECADE, Richard Burns Rally STILL sells for 20£, (31$). I don't care if mods aren't integrated into online rallies, just as long as I can make my own tracks and cars.

Again, I presume it's a TON of work to try to make something like this work with Dirt: Rally, but I felt I needed to say this anyway:  The ability to drive anywhere in the world at a whim is exactly what I've wanted in a driving sim game for years.   Just imagining being able to create our own stages anywhere in the world is astounding to me. Make some kind of stage out of Everest / K2 / several volcanos.... Tear through the hilly backroads of PA or even just seeing how fast that one mountainy road near your house can be taken in a rally car....  But I know it's not reasonable for you guys to add something like this to your development time. Perhaps unlocking the tools for modders is an option? It was mentioned in the Reddit thread but I'm sure it has it's own wall of legal issues.   That said though, however hopeless it may seem, I had to say it.

dirtgame,3dmf2a,every-man,7,Tue Jul 21 19:51:33 2015 UTC,GREAT! :D I love this communication we have with you. I LOVE you CM! I really really do!
dirtgame,3dmf2a,volcomsnow909,9,Fri Jul 17 13:38:59 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you @ the DiRT dev team. In my opinion this is early access done right! I've got one question about a bug:  I still drop out of gear to neutral randomly. I am using a G27 with H-Shifter. It happens randomly it seems, sometimes not at all and sometimes multiple times per stage. Is it something being simulated or just a bug. The problem with reporting it is that it happens randomly and it is hard to reproduce."
dirtgame,3dmf2a,Jastley,3,Fri Jul 17 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to reproduce. G27 + H Pattern and clutch, it's guaranteed to happen at least one or two times during the stage. It's annoying as hell, please we need this fixed."
dirtgame,3dmf2a,Rynji,2,Fri Jul 17 22:33:37 2015 UTC,I also have this problem. Figured it was just a bug as ive never had issues shifting in Assetto or anything else. For me it is ALWAYS 4th gear.
dirtgame,3dmf2a,Jastley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:07:12 2015 UTC,I always thought that was because I didn't clutch the shift right and it slips out of gear. Is that not intended?
dirtgame,3dmf2a,FromBeyond,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"It happens when already in gear and driving, not while changing gears."

dirtgame,3dmf2a,SLiiDE101,0,Tue Jul 21 08:52:00 2015 UTC,"Some have said that it can pop out of gear if not shifted correctly (clutch in, then change gears, then clutch out).  Try recalibrating your clutch pedal to only 10-30% of the travel is where it maxes out (just slightly push in clutch pedal on calibration, depress brake and gas pedals fully, then hit Continue).  See if this helps..."

Finland is always going to win (sorry America).   I don't have any particular personal preference between one or the other, but I was thinking that American Rally is a fairly fast growing sport and that including more tracks from America might have the potential to increase the awareness and popularity of the sport, and by extension become a boon to the 'Dirt' franchise.

You're talking about three World RX tracks (Holjes, Lyssen and Hell). Are you gonna include all tracks or just some of them?   Talking about tracks: Is there any possibility that a track editor will be supported?"
dirtgame,3dmf2a,mazdarati2,3,Fri Jul 17 13:40:43 2015 UTC,"RE- World RX: It will just be those tracks in DiRT Rally but we currently have 3 routes on each to race on.  Track Editor - honestly I don't think it's going to be possible, it's something we started tinkering with way before release believe it or not but our tech isn't where it needs to be to able to pull it off.  Ultimately we'd want a edited track to feel and look like a purpose built stage, have it feel natural and flowing and not just like a jigsaw of pieces that you lay down.   We'd love to have one, it would ensure that the game could live on forever - we just don't think we could build one right now that would be at the quality bar we'd want."
dirtgame,3dmf2a,Procrastinator_5000,4,Fri Jul 17 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"Is there any word on allowing mod support for things such as stages? I can understand not having the capacity to build a full fledged stage editor, but I feel the ability for the community to make their own maps for download is a must. You guys have produced some top quality stages so far, and I fully believe you will continue to do so with the same level of detail. But at the end of the day, you guys can only make so much, and the community has the ability to keep the game going forever, even once development has officially ended. Games like RBR and rFactor are a testament to that. DiRT is an excellent game right now, and it deserves to have that kind of longevity.   Thanks again for taking the time to talk with the community. I broke my policy of not buying early access for this game and, over 100 hours of game time later, I have not regretted it."

dirtgame,3dmf2a,MurdocTheMurd,6,Fri Jul 17 14:20:50 2015 UTC,Fantasy tracks wouldn't fit with the kind of game we're trying to make so probably not. Would much rather have a real track over a fantasy one.

However, do you have plans to have dlc stages after the game is finished? Many people would like to have more stages in one game opposed to waiting for a dirt rally 2. What are your thoughts on this?"

However combined with the other replies in this thread, I'm getting the picture that once you guys finish the early access path you've set out for yourselves, you'll move on to another project entirely?   So once it's officially released, what's there is it, no more stages or cars from that point onward? Now it's a fair thing to do, I imagine with the additional rallies you have planned, the amount of available content will be sufficient, but I guess I'm just looking for confirmation that that is the plan content-wise?"

dirtgame,3dobm3,attunezero,5,Fri Jul 17 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely!  Need very cautious use of the throttle (~10-40% usually) on corners until you are straight enough to get back on it.  Also, if you loosen the rear differential it will make it much easier to not spin out.  Once you get used to it, the Stratos is a beast!  Took me a few hours to get the hang of it."

dirtgame,3dobm3,Atlantacus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:23:19 2015 UTC,My biggest thing was getting linearity to or near 100 and turning sensitivity down near 20. I had the inverse to start and while twitchy works in FWD and arcade rally it wont help you here. With linearity high just moving the stick small amount will let you turn without spinning out
dirtgame,3dobm3,biznology,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"I found the Sierra Cosworth a gentle introduction to RWD on a 360 controller, and placed 3rd in Clubman with it. I didn't adjust any settings or tunings, it was just a matter of being very gentle on the throttle—a lot of throttle steering; almost never full throttle; and easing out of corners, and only until the car is settled did I give it more gas. Avoiding the handbrake was another habit I had to break with RWD."
dirtgame,3dobm3,dwkGravey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"To answer the question: Yes.  A couple notes though:  • The Stratos is a bad choice to start on, the higher Power/Weight ratio, and mid engine set-up make it a real beast, as such it can be difficult to drive  • When it comes to RWD there's a few things to keep in mind, more so than FWD or 4WD, these are the tightness of the diff, and how much/how quickly you throttle up. I find on gravel/dirt surfaces, particularly Greece, you'll want to knock the diff tightness down to 75% of it's maximum to help reduce the chance of large oversteer, it also helps to throttle up a bit slower, if you go from nothing to 100% you'll likely spin out, instead bring it up to about 50%, and then slowly go up the other 50%, this helps keep the car stable, and allows you to use the full power range of the car."

dirtgame,3djmpv,withoutapaddle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:56:58 2015 UTC,"I've got hundreds of hours into sims with a force feedback wheel and pedals, but Dirt Rally is the first game I tried to play with a proper H-shifter and clutch pedal.  It's insanely hard.  I can place 1st in Professional with the paddle shifters, and I'm lucky if I'm 8th in Clubman with the H-shifter.  Is there any good way to learn all the fancy footwork needed for 3-pedal racing?"
dirtgame,3djmpv,PrintError,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Heel-toe your downshifts every time IRL. Casually practice this every light and stop sign, every day. It gets to be second nature. My first few track days, my instructors were always telling me that my downshifts were butter smooth because of this. A zillion track days later and a decade of daily driving stick, I don't even give it a thought. Naturally, this easily transfers over to the simulator, where driving H+Clutch is the only possible option."
dirtgame,3djmpv,withoutapaddle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"I find it a lot easier in real life than with a G27 shifter and pedals, though.  I think that's part of the problem.  I have no real feel for the clutch in game, and obviously don't know the cars in game anywhere near as good as my daily driver.  It's certainly good practice to do it IRL, but I was surprised how different it felt in a simulator :/"
dirtgame,3djmpv,PrintError,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with sims is I can't FEEL the car. FFB does a little, but inertia does a lot IRL."
dirtgame,3djmpv,withoutapaddle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I can't claim much experience actually racing, but my father did it for decades.  When I finally got him to try some sims (with FFB wheel) he really enjoyed them, but struggled because it was like racing with one of your senses missing (the inertia and feeling of the car)."
dirtgame,3djmpv,SiddTheVicious,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"Once you figure it out you'll be even faster. One of the things that significantly increased my times is to really take advantage of downshifting. Most of the time engine braking is extremely more effective.   When I first got my g27, by habit I always kept the clutch pressed down when I wasn't on the throttle but once I realized how much it improved my corning to keep the clutch out and the revs up, it greatly improved my stage times."

dirtgame,3djmpv,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:10:39 2015 UTC,"It is about knowing what you're gonna do next and planning ahead. If I've got hair pin coming up I'll probably hit the brakes and downshift to 2nd while holding the clutch down, when I've slowed down enough I'll still hold the clutch down and get the revs up and dump the clutch to spin the tires. I might add a dab of handbrake there if I feel its required like in case of the acute post in bidno moorland.  You need to know beforehand what gear you want to be in, you won't be changing gears if your left foot is on the brake when it should be on the clutch."
dirtgame,3djmpv,Pure_Decimation,3,Fri Jul 17 06:48:06 2015 UTC,"The game is definitely challenging (as it should be). Try not to get overly discouraged and just keep practicing. You don't go out and win a rally on your first try (most don't even finish), so expect the same from a rally simulator. So just have fun with it.   Side note: Pull that wheel back out! It will take some time to get used to, but its so much more rewarding to drive with and once you hone your skills, will be much faster ;)"

dirtgame,3dk2ty,duffking,7,Thu Jul 16 22:20:33 2015 UTC,"What car did you purchase? That makes worlds of difference. The abarth is the most beginner friendly car in the class, with the stratos being the most difficult. Personally I find the rwd model substantially easier than FWD.  In this game, it doesn't matter what class you move to or what car, your times will suffer for the first few rallies. Remember that you have no upgrades and you're learning something new.  The other reason 1970s is second (apart from chronology) is that being able to drive the escort or stratos will make everything but the lancia 037 so much easier for you. Even the 80s rwd cars are easier"
dirtgame,3dk2ty,A1rHorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but let's face it, most people playing this have no experience rallying, and probably no experience driving a RWD car on gravel. When you're learning, the key thing is progression. Of course this is aimed to be a sim and all, but still, it could be a lot more accessible just due to car selection. I wish there was an open class in the game, or group N (or whatever it's called now). Something with moderate power, good stability, and less oversteer than the RWD cars."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,batistini,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"If someone is new to sim racers and they start rally in a fwd car, a rwd is going to be a completely different animal. It will just take a different driving style. Quite the learning curve for a beginner having only experienced fwd rally."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,thegil13,2,Fri Jul 17 10:56:42 2015 UTC,"If you were to start in an awd group n car, the rwd transition would be every bit as hard. Possibly even harder because throttle control isn't very important in awd rally cars compared to rwd or fwd.  I understand the point, group n would be a nice option, but if you were to price the cars anywhere near realistically they'd be the same price as kit cars"
dirtgame,3dk2ty,A1rHorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:57 2015 UTC,Definitely. I'm not saying that fwd to rwd is any harder than another drivetrain. I only wanted to say that changing drivetrain is difficult.
dirtgame,3dk2ty,thegil13,2,Sat Jul 18 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"That said though, I would like to see group n in the game."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,A1rHorn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:18:19 2015 UTC,"I went with the Fiat, which probably says it all really.   I think I might just turn the assists on for now and try to turn them down over time."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,A1rHorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"There is no shame in having assists on if the curve is too steep. The other thing that may be worth trying is rallying the mini for a while and moving to the f2 kit car class, specifically the seat Ibiza, or even the 60s fulvia. They're more aggressive, but still manageable, and they'll teach you more about oversteer and weight balance, which in turn will make rwd easier for you."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,SiddTheVicious,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"The fiat is, in my opinion, the easiest to drive. However the Stratos is the most fun (and most frightening).   Here's a couple tips:  Set the rear differential looser, set the brake bias closer to front (not all the way front). This will help you with oversteer.   Overall you need to improve throttle control and avoid flooring it anywhere but straight lines until you've mastered this."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,GenerouslyLachrymose,3,Tue Jul 21 06:30:26 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your experience too.  I still haven't quite figured out FWD, but I'm very comfortable with the RWD. Part of that might be due to me having driven an old RWD Volvo for the last ten years in Maine winters.  I imagine more people are familiar with FWD at this point so I can see why starting off there makes sense."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,Spoonwacker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"I'm also working on this step. Went from the Fulvia to the Kadett, and just finished my second rally on the second difficult level. I found the best strategy was just to take everything a gear higher than I thought it should be and focus on line and control rather than outright speed. I finished 5th and 4th in the first couple of rallies, and now that I'm getting a feel for controlling the car while sliding I'm using the proper gears more often. I notice my mid-corner throttle use is getting stabbier, too, kind of like karting - on throttle to rotate the rear a bit, off to let the front bite, on to rotate more, off to turn more, and then finally on for corner exit.  I'm having a lot of fun now, but the first one was start-->high speed power oversteer into trees-->recover-->spin under braking into trees-->recover-->spin on corner exit-->recover for the first mile. I feel like mastering the RWD cars will make everything but the Group B beasts a lot easier to handle.  Side note: I went back and did a single stage in the Fulvia for fun last night, and was thrown off by the torque steer. I hadn't even noticed it the first time around!"
dirtgame,3dk2ty,FromBeyond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:52:19 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you, the FWD drive cars are so much easier to control (low power FWD cars are a lot more forgiving to drive) than for example the 70's Escort.   On gravel I feel it's pretty okay, but on tarmac (Monaco) it's an absolute frustrating nightmare. I think Dirt Rally could really use a training mode of some kind to get players to learn some techniques on different road surfaces, and I think the jump in difficulty will be bridged witch much less frustration.."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,EkkuZakku,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:50:53 2015 UTC,"I went from the Lancia Fulvia to the Group B RWD Opel Manta, wasn't too difficult of a change for me. Then again, I've got lots of experience with RWD cars in sims, and much prefer them to FWD. I know the Fulvia is easier to slide on gravel than the Mini (that's why I chose it in the first place), more akin to the RWD cars, so try the Fulvia for a little while before trying RWD again."
dirtgame,3dk2ty,SonicBroom51,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:20:22 2015 UTC,"For me I had a hard time with the 70s as well. I skipped up to the AWD instead. Then went back to RWD after I learned the feel.   Finally, go slow. Go half throttle. Part of this game is learning the tracks, learning to interpret what your co-driver is ""actually saying"".   For me it we more fun to go slower and not fly off the track every other turn than to constantly restart and waste money.  (On that note practice in non-career mode to save money).   Personally I keep bouncing back and forth between Clubman and Professional difficulties. I'm using an Xbone controller with Kontrol Freak thumb extensions. It's not the best but as good as I can do right now.   Once you have experienced some i call ""driving in the pocket"" this game is an absolute thrill. It's magical. Lose your concentration for half a thought and its butt puckerin time."

dirtgame,3dh80c,fredthebig,2,Thu Jul 16 09:30:08 2015 UTC,"I use a controller too and I played hundreds of hours of Dirt 3, the best advice I can give you is to turn all the assists off. They make the cars less predictable (imo) and the game harder to play."
dirtgame,3dh80c,Atlantacus,2,Thu Jul 16 11:58:47 2015 UTC,"The main advice I can give you is smooth is fast. Focus on getting into a rhythm first, taking smooth lines. This will probably mean you'll find yourself driving slower than you feel you can really go, but that's okay. Once you find that groove and you're taking corners smoothly, then you can start to speed up and push a little.   There are some good guides out there that go into all the different parts of the setup, I would highly recommend searching for them on steam and giving them a read. One thing I will add is to play around with the sensitivity on your pad. I am a wheel user but I do occasionally play the game with a PS3 controller. I run a low sensitivity (30%) with no deadzone. Experiment with some of the different settings and find what works for you."

dirtgame,3dh80c,_Deh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Start with the Cooper and drive it a lot until you've got the hang of the stages and the pace notes and everything, it's way easier to do that in a slower car.  The Engineer doesn't change anything with the car's handling, so don't worry too much about that.  I also would advice against changing any of the car settings right away. It's possible to be really fast with the default settings (I still haven't changed mine after 52 hours playtime) and its better to spend your attention on becoming good rather than analyzing minor changes in handling imo. :) Also check YouTube for rally driving classes, the real world lessons do apply to the game, especially the one concerning weight transfer.

When time is up, the server rewards credits to players based on performance and initiates a stage/car change. Racenet would log global leaderboard times as normal. You could switch to spectate mode if you want to take a break or improve your driving. Ideally there would be a keybind to toggle the visibility of the other cars between visible/semi transparent/transparent.    Also, have you thought about the esports scene?

dirtgame,3ddmfz,The_Stig_Farmer,2,Wed Jul 15 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, I actually remember this week. Apologies for three (relatively minor!) things.  Minor UI thing: On the ""Service Area"" screen before the stage (where you can do car setup, shakedown, start the stage, etc.) the highlight for the user's menu selection is white, which works fine and fits the palette. But... The ""Start Stage"" lineitem is a light grey. Orange is in your palette, so maaaybe making the selection highlight orange would serve as better visual feedback.  Saving Setups: I like that it says asphalt, gravel, etc. I like to name my setups in other games after the place I created and used it, unless the game indexes them per track anyway. If, when saving a setup, pre-filling the preset name with the course/stage name, road conditions or something like that would be super handy, and save nerds like me from having to grab the keyboard and type in a useful description I won't forget in an hour.  The tachometer was a familiar face to see when I first started this game up. I remember its cousins in Grid Autosport. I don't know if you're obligated to leverage such assets verbatim on pain of death. (I code too. I also avoid re-inventing functions when I work on other projects where they'd fit.) But, the only thing I dislike about that tach is that it acts like the needle weighs 10 kilos. The needle seems to lag behind what the engine sounds/feels like it's doing, swinging and overshooting. It's very ""floaty."" It would just make me warm and fuzzy inside if the tach behaved like a snappy modern, low-latency analog gauge.  I think that's it! Thanks for your time, guys. :)"

I think the fact the roads were wider than a NASCAR track was off putting, although I understand it isn't a time based rally game and you were racing other cars. I just think it came out at a time post GT and Forza where people knew you could do arcade and sim-ish together and the cars felt like cars IRL. Sega Rally in the arcade had the benefit of being in a booth, with a wheel and even then the driving was no where near real feeling even for arcade. It was closer to Cruising USA."

dirtgame,3d9l4u,Carbi,8,Tue Jul 14 15:55:26 2015 UTC,"I was a marshal at this exact jump in 2012. The next year, someone crashed and died in a historic car after he lost control at the jump. So glad that I couldn't make it in 2013."
dirtgame,3d9l4u,Lendentorpedo,5,Tue Jul 14 18:54:26 2015 UTC,"Ack, that's not good. I can imagine it being quite a dangerous jump for spectators too. Even in game I found myself unable to keep control if I jumped incorrectly, and sometimes finding myself sliding towards spectators."
dirtgame,3d9l4u,Lendentorpedo,8,Tue Jul 14 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really dangerous but the spectators at the track won't understand this. The jump itself isn't that difficult to drive but who knows where the car will land IF something happens.  There were families with children that pushed the barriers closer to the track and the guys from the press insisted on standing at the most dangerous spots. If you tell them to go back you are the asshole. One of the reasons why I won't help again."
dirtgame,3d9l4u,gastuf,5,Tue Jul 14 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"Aah, that sounds frustrating. It's kinda like Group B in the 80's in a way. I think the spectators trust the driver's ability way too much."

dirtgame,3d9l4u,puluminati,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, Panzerplatte. And the jump is called ""Gina"". It is on U.S. military territory which I always thought was very cool for a rally stage.  I also really like that codemasters adds those small details to the track, for example these little red houses that stand left to the long straight. I think they are used for some kind of maneuver training in real life."

Super arcade, hardly comparable to DR but the MP aspect was such a blast it got me heated for a 'like' experience in DR.  I have some practicing to do."

dirtgame,3d7o4j,FormatA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:05 2015 UTC,I agree.  I always felt they were aimed pretty low so you're having an issue of seeing down the road when the car's nose is pointing down.  If they would adjust hem up it would greatly improve night visibility.
dirtgame,3d88z4,Crushker,9,Tue Jul 14 07:33:21 2015 UTC,"The style guide has changed a huge amount since the start of the project.  I'd really like to go back and adjust (fix :P) the cameras I did for the launch stages if I ever get time. Rest assured, I've taken on as much feedback as I'm able, and I hope this has been reflected in the later tracks. I really like how Germany in particular turned out."
dirtgame,3d88z4,partthethird,3,Tue Jul 14 07:52:07 2015 UTC,"This trackpack is definitely a step in the right direction. Longer distant shots of the car approaching and passing cameras are like a rally fans subconscious essentials. Kind of what the fans see when they line a stage.

dirtgame,3d6uds,Dark_Egg,3,Tue Jul 14 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"This idea would be awesome! They have something similar in GTA V, where you get paired up with someone for a race and only the co-driver can see the route on their minimap, so they have to call it as the driver races. I did my first race like that yesterday and it was super fun!"
dirtgame,3d6uds,Van_Tek,3,Tue Jul 14 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"I REALLY want a pacenote editor.  Here is how I would do it provided I had the chops.   Have a bank of calls with multiple versions of each call that get called randomly.  This way you don't get just the straight computer same call again and again (multiple calls for ""5 Left"" for example) Now I would place the calls during a pause.  You would enter a fly mode that would start wherever your car is and it would fly along the drive line (the line that they place your car on when you get recovered) with a ""wall of light"", and once you reach the obstacle that you want the call for you would place the wall and then be able to tweak the call for that location. If there was a Recce mode I would allow you to place a brand new  car (while removing your old one) wherever your light wall is so that you can go back a ways and re-drive a section of road to test your notes. Existing notes should be a different color light wall placed on the track that when your light wall on them you would be able to edit that note (and maybe have a list of existing notes that you could quick jump to, your cursor would start wherever your car currently is and you would jump to the location in the fly mode). We should be able to save the notes in such a way that they can be tied to a specific car if we wanted or applied broadly and in such a way that we could easily transfer them to another person if we wanted.   Anyway, that is how I would do it.  Sorry to rant.  Cheers."
dirtgame,3d6uds,deadstump,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"Most of the requirements for a (couch) coop/recce mode are already in the game (you can disable onscreen and audio pacenotes, you can drive slowly through the map). I've done one stage this way and it was a blast.  Personally, the only thing I'd like would be a PDF (or a way to generate a pdf) from the existing visual pacenotes to use as a starting point."
dirtgame,3d6uds,billiamthesecond,3,Tue Jul 14 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"Ya I realize we could currently do couch coop, which is great fun, but unfortunately I can't get people over enough to do it reliably.   I think an online version should be simple enough, at least once the pvp update happens and we already have the full multiplayer experience. At that point it would be as simple as having the other player have a camera for your car so they could make the call outs.   Shouldn't be that terribly difficult from a technical perspective. So ill keep my fingers crossed."
dirtgame,3d6uds,billiamthesecond,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, agreed. I wonder how much of an issue latency would be..."
dirtgame,3d6uds,najtrows,2,Tue Jul 14 02:13:27 2015 UTC,Would probably be less of an issue than in pvp. As long as the codriver isn't getting insane lag where the car is jumping all over the road a few milliseconds shouldn't be enough to throw off the calls.
dirtgame,3d5blt,forceh,10,Mon Jul 13 17:21:15 2015 UTC,I just dislike the fact that some corners (hair pins I've noticed the most) when you go a bit of the road and accidentally cut the corner it seems to auto penalize you. And 15 seconds for a tiny slip up seems to harsh.
dirtgame,3d5blt,Shmink_,9,Mon Jul 13 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"The times I've noticed this happening is when you ""hit"" a person standing in the apex. You always get a penalty when you drive too close to people even if you're driving slowly."
dirtgame,3d5blt,Harmonic_Series,3,Tue Jul 14 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"It's not even that, this is especially noticeable on Monaco, it isn't actually if you hit the peds, its if you hit some kind of bounding box around them. There's quite a few hairpins on monaco where the yellow tape is part of that box even though the peds are standing a few feet back from it."
dirtgame,3d5blt,dsiOneBAN2,2,Tue Jul 14 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's the tape, and I think that's fair. The tape marks the safe area for the spectators; you cross the tape, you've violated the spectator zone. So I'm just extra careful around those hairpins, as I should be."
dirtgame,3d5blt,dwkGravey,2,Tue Jul 14 04:37:30 2015 UTC,You shouldn't get teleported back onto the center of the road in neutral. There could be a more realistic solution.

dirtgame,3d5blt,dwkGravey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:31:02 2015 UTC,1) The tape isn't people  2) The tape can be broken without being teleported everywhere else (even other places in Monaco)
dirtgame,3d5blt,dsiOneBAN2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:52:10 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if they animated the peds so they ran out the way. Tricky to get that to work though I imagine.

If that spectator model wasn't there I'd drop a tire of the road for a tiny bit and continue on, losing maybe a second.  Instead I lose 15 seconds for a penalty, plus the extra time needed to get back up to speed."

dirtgame,3d5blt,perfectstorm99,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:02:48 2015 UTC,I've only played about 13 hours of Dirt Rally but I started with all onscreen and assists turned off.

dirtgame,3d5blt,SodlidDesu,7,Fri Jul 17 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"I've always imagined it's because you would need someone to physically push your car onto the track again, which would take at least 15 seconds if you're banked.   On that note, having spectators come in and help you or check on you when you're stranded in a ditch would have been so awesome. More interaction in general would be brilliant."
dirtgame,3d5blt,dromtrund,3,Mon Jul 13 21:03:51 2015 UTC,<evil chuckle>  You could make it a mini game where you would have to direct the fans through waving your hand out the window in rhythm with their pulling/pushing... I would never get out of the ditch.
dirtgame,3d5blt,deadstump,3,Tue Jul 14 00:06:28 2015 UTC,I just watched a re-live on WRC+ where a car went into the snow bank and 7+ spectators rushed over to push him back onto the road. He finished the stage in 13th place +43 seconds. 15s doesn't seem too bad after seeing that :P
dirtgame,3d5blt,Jastley,3,Tue Jul 14 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"I remember the old Superbike games where you could enable a setting where your rider (and all the other AI riders) had to run to their bike and then pick it back up (with some effort!) after a crash to get going again. IIRC there was some slight control over it because other bikes could get in the way/you could get run over (and in doing so, cause THEM to fall off their bike, which led to hilarious chain reactions that I still remember fondly to this day)"
dirtgame,3d5blt,dsiOneBAN2,4,Tue Jul 14 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"It really bothers me when i've run a few wheels off and am headed back on track with relative ease and it resets you with a penalty. Wait for the car to come to rest IMO, would really help from breaking the immersion too."
dirtgame,3d5blt,ConeDodger,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:22 2015 UTC,"Also add quick way to restart when you go off, I was stuck by some tree and there was no way out, lost 30 sec."

dirtgame,3d5blt,TDawg_603,4,Mon Jul 13 20:03:12 2015 UTC,I think a more accurate damage model could fix that pretty easily.
dirtgame,3d5blt,tcpip4lyfe,4,Tue Jul 14 00:23:20 2015 UTC,It would certainly cause a lot more retirements.
dirtgame,3d5blt,AllezCannes,3,Tue Jul 14 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"On the other end of the scale, crashing into spectators isn't punished enough. If I fly into a crowd with my car, I'm sure the consequences will be harsher than ""15 seconds"". It could be handled like driving off a cliff, totaled/dnf/auto retire?"
dirtgame,3d5blt,iktnl,2,Tue Jul 14 01:12:15 2015 UTC,In the same vein: when driving with the clutch it's very frustrating to be reset and instantly stall if i didnt have my foot on the gas amd wasn't clutched in
dirtgame,3d5blt,Raptord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:24:43 2015 UTC,It's come to the point where I clutch if I know I've lost it and am waiting for the reset.
dirtgame,3d5blt,SodlidDesu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:29 2015 UTC,I think that the penalty should be based off how close you are to the nearest spectator.  The closer the less time.  The more spectators the less time.  Also it should depend on how far off the road you are.
dirtgame,3d5blt,deadstump,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:07:15 2015 UTC,"I would like to try get back on the road by myself, no matter how far I'm off. And If I realise that this is not possible, then quick reset button. After the car rolls it shouldn't autmaticcaly roll back on wheels, come on.Hitting spectator definitely should coest more time.  Extreme example: in vanilla RBR when difficulty was set to realistic when you hit sepctator helicopter would appear and you were retired from the rally;) I also had situtations like /u/Shmink_ when getting to close in hairpin resets the car with penalty, should be fixed as well. And I agree with /u/tcpip4lyfe that damage model is to forgiving."

(or just the durration of time at the facility seeing as I can always divide the total time by the number of drivers and then subtract a bit for time consumed by normal lost time shit (like lunch))"
dirtgame,3d5ru8,deadstump,2,Mon Jul 13 19:32:55 2015 UTC,If I had to guess it'd probably be about 45 minutes of seat time.  Which is a great deal compared to what it costs normally.  The rig is totally worth it.
dirtgame,3d5ru8,deadstump,2,Mon Jul 13 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, that rig costs around $100/hr?!?  I mean that is ballpark the price for a CNC machine to run."
dirtgame,3d5ru8,deadstump,2,Mon Jul 13 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"Basically yes.  But you're getting to run pretty much any sim you want (iRacing, rF2, AC, Dirt Rally, etc...) and it's a motion sim.  I was skeptical until I used it last week.  HOLY COW it takes everything to another level."
dirtgame,3d5ru8,SimCraft1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't doubt that it is awesome.  I was just surprised at the price."

dirtgame,3d5ru8,QuitoPR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:19:04 2015 UTC,I'm local but $75 is way too steep for me. Maybe if it included pickup and drop off in a limo with drink service.
dirtgame,3d7bcm,Shuino,3,Tue Jul 14 02:09:02 2015 UTC,The subaru is my favorite and because of the handling i get better times than a higher hp car.
dirtgame,3d7bcm,icarusjapan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:18:58 2015 UTC,Even throwing down a pretty much flawless run I only managed to win a race by about 2 seconds in Elite and the car just feels so much slower then the S4.
dirtgame,3d7bcm,mmm1kko,3,Tue Jul 14 02:28:10 2015 UTC,The AI is better in group A.
dirtgame,3d7bcm,A1rHorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:08:25 2015 UTC,It starts to feel (and go) quicker after you get advanced setup and can change the torque split
dirtgame,3d7bcm,A1rHorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"I really need to do this, so many people have mentioned it. The car does handled almost like a FWD car and you can really notice that in the hairpins."
dirtgame,3d7bcm,Tal_S,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah the amount of push is absolutely ridiculous when you first get the car. Once you tune that out though, its a quick (if boring) car"
dirtgame,3d7bcm,axxor-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Not only that, but it understeers like a pig on ice- even with the differentials open and alot of rear brake bias.  So weird. The Delta just turns"
dirtgame,3d7bcm,thatmotorfreak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"It is really slow without upgrades. It will probably still feel slow to you once upgraded since you've been playing the Delta S4, but it certainly gets better once its upgraded. I'd also recommend adjusting the torque split once you get advanced setup, it's default adjusted waaaay too far towards the front and makes it feel like a FWD car."

dirtgame,3d3tqn,Procrastinator_5000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:23:34 2015 UTC,I've been using it since v2.0 or v3.0 and I agree with you.  This FFB has lowered my stage times by a pretty significant margin.  I haven't had a chance to find settings that I like for v5.0 though with my fanatec csr.  The FFB got very weak in v5.0 compared to v4.0.
dirtgame,3d3tqn,euronate,2,Mon Jul 13 11:46:58 2015 UTC,For logitech wheels it was recommended to put everything on 100% and tune overal strength with profiler. Not sure if same holds for other wheels.

I love it!"
dirtgame,3d3tqn,neverender158,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:12:32 2015 UTC,I bought Dirt Rally during the steam sale and this had the update with the new ffb. I ran I session with the default ffb and then got the impact ffb patch.  The impact ffb patch really made a big difference.  I am glad I waited to buy Dirt Rally until these ffb issues were resolved. I am really loving this game!
dirtgame,3d3tqn,SiddTheVicious,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:00 2015 UTC,I have a G27 wheel and I've tried each version as they've came out. I'd say v5 is the best and it makes the FFB much improved. Just make sure you follow his instructions and you won't be disappointed.
dirtgame,3d6cje,fredthebig,2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:56 2015 UTC,Could improve the camera work man. the rear facing view was pretty useless at showing what happened.

dirtgame,3d1vje,withoutapaddle,6,Sun Jul 12 21:12:26 2015 UTC,If you hold down shift for a bit longer it will go straight to 1 then tap it 2 more times to get to reverse. That's the best solution right now I think.

dirtgame,3d06cb,vmaxmuffin,2,Sun Jul 12 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Many games use a peer-to-peer multiplayer system, so naturally any multiplayer game you set up between players on the same network will function as a LAN.   On a related subject I'd really like to see dedicated server support."
dirtgame,3d06cb,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:43:09 2015 UTC,That's if they don't use a master server before the p2p.  and yes dedicated servers like you have in Assetto Corsa would be brilliant.
dirtgame,3d06cb,GTOfire,2,Mon Jul 13 11:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure on what exactly classifies as P2P, but I believe the definition is a direct connection between two ""peers"", hence having a master server in between would not be P2P.  Borderlands 2 is an example of a game I've been playing through with a friend recently that uses this connection method. When we're on the same network it functions as a LAN."

dirtgame,3cw4ld,lifeandthensome,23,Sat Jul 11 07:15:52 2015 UTC,"Games like F1 and FIFA know they can release a game every year because people want to play the latest season. Dirt Rally is different in that regard, it's only been in alpha for a few months so it's not even fully released yet. I wouldn't panic just yet although game developers are in it to make games; when they finish a game they aren't going to sit around doing nothing, they will spend some time patching and updating it but they're going to start on the next game fairly soon"
dirtgame,3cw4ld,joey676,7,Sat Jul 11 07:27:28 2015 UTC,"I hope this is true I'll gladly play this game for the next 5 years and keep buying content for it, I hate it when sequels come out so soon the product suffers massively."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,axxor-,16,Sat Jul 11 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"F1 is influence by their FOM licence, something which DiRT does not have to deal with. I wouldn't panic as while yes they are released under the same Codemasters game, that does not mean they have to share anything with one another."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,Furiou5,2,Sat Jul 11 09:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I never thought of it before, but I would not be surprised if part of holding the F1 license is that they have to release a game yearly.

dirtgame,3cw4ld,iktnl,15,Sat Jul 11 19:12:35 2015 UTC,DiRT Rally isn't WRC licensed so there isn't much worry about if they need to rush it.
dirtgame,3cw4ld,djfil007,6,Sat Jul 11 08:58:28 2015 UTC,"As much as we would love a FIA WRC licence, yearly series like F1 and the current WRC games are a good example of why this can always backfire."

dirtgame,3cw4ld,Weerm,3,Sat Jul 11 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it could be similar. It's just one part of the game. Even if they had to include a small update for every year, that would pose little to no problems for the rest of the development.  It's not like they are going to release ""Dirt rally 2 RX World Rallycross 2016 edition"" next year..."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,Emperalhero,2,Sun Jul 12 10:30:49 2015 UTC,"No, because look what happened last weekend, every rx driver gave feedback thus improving the game experience, i've never seem this by other rally game publishers."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,marts30,12,Mon Jul 13 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"The F1 and DiRT teams are separate. They share tech though. Only way the F1 series will ever get good is if they do what DiRT is doing, early access and take feedback. It's still old-gen in so many ways the PC ports are bad and lazy."

dirtgame,3cw4ld,Procrastinator_5000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:42:03 2015 UTC,From what I've heard the game itself is quite good. It just is the terrible port that ruins the game. So they dont necessarely need early access.
dirtgame,3cw4ld,Weerm,6,Mon Jul 13 16:58:33 2015 UTC,"These games are from different studios, sure codemasters the publisher probably has last say. But the license limits them to push out games like this.   Don't you think the FIA for Formula 1 cares more about getting a product out every season? Codemasters have the opportunity to make an awesome game with all of the data imaginable, but ultimately the product of Formula 1 is bigger than codemasters game. The FIA takes advantage of that."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,deadstump,5,Sat Jul 11 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"The only reason why I think DiRT is somewhat safe is because rally is no where near as popular as F1. An annual rally game just wouldn't be worth it. I am slightly concerned about the rallycross bit though. I really hope that there isn't a yearly component there unless it is a DLC thing, and I am fairly confident that it won't be."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,DeathHaze420,4,Sat Jul 11 12:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just look at how the original Dirt series had diminishing returns when they released games too close together."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,teabagZz,5,Sat Jul 11 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"I requested a refund after I tried to fix and love the game. Sadly steam said ""Sorry, you have over 2h of playtime, we can't refund you."". Can't really blame steam, that's their rule and I am fine with it.  BUT how can Codemasters think it is okay to release such a broken piece of shit on PC? The game itself is great but it has so many problems it is unbelievable. That's not just one just one bug that 1 out of 100 people will experience. EVERYONE got a crash on the benchmark, EVERYONE has all assists turned on and can't turn them off in ""Pro Season"" mode. Furthermore noone can use his/her mic because for whatever reason only console playerrs can talk to their engineer. The handling, the graphics and especially the AI are better than ever - but I simply can't play it. Every 10 minutes my game freezes, there is NO WAY for me to play that game.   Release it in EarlyAccess and I am fine with it. But don't claim that this is the best shit that's ever happened to F1 games.   Hopefully this will be their last F1 game and someone else buys the rights because the contract expires 2016. I have basically all modern Codemasters games (all F1 games, all Dirt games, even Operation Flashpoint) and this was the last time I've ever bought a Codemasters product. I had so much hope and trusted you guys, it makes me sad. Noone will care about this post but I had to get it off my chest."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,dgeesio,3,Sat Jul 11 23:10:19 2015 UTC,its not the same people.
dirtgame,3cw4ld,EastyUK,3,Sat Jul 11 12:27:11 2015 UTC,Maybe it's the console syndrome.. They create a game always limited by the weakest links. When daunting release schedules are looming you don't want to be trying to have different builds pushing the game in each environment.
dirtgame,3cw4ld,SkitTrick,-4,Sat Jul 11 09:20:31 2015 UTC,"This shitpost extraordinaire is completely unnecessary. The devs have been nothing so far if not perfectly transparent, all the bugs in the game are known and posted here daily, in a sub run by the same devs. The very success of this game so far hinges on the fact that from the beginning they set out to do things different and properly, and every ounce of feedback from us has some way of getting to them.  Hard to believe your objective is not just to stir shit up."
dirtgame,3cw4ld,Ashiataka,7,Sat Jul 11 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"A shit post? I just asked for reassurances of the developers and details on the long term strategy,   Forgive me but due to the sorry ass state of games thesedays and then how badly F1 2015 turns out which is by the same publisher I thought it fair enough to seek reassurance.   I'm very happy with how dirt rally has turned out hence why I was concerned, this is I feel this is one of the greatest PC game a triple A developer has produced and I want it to stay that way, I mean really how would you feel if just after this game comes out of early access they announce they already have plans for dirt rally 2?"
dirtgame,3cw4ld,SkitTrick,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"It is pretty rubbish. Your reassurance is the near constant stream of updates, blogs, articles etc. the team is putting on the site.  What do you expect they're going to say ""yeah, we're not going to do it like the people in that other department (who are probably our friends, and who work for the same company that pays us) did it because that was so stupid, I'd never buy one of their games again""?"

If you had given any thought to this before making a post you would've arrived at the same conclusion most people in this sub did, which goes more along the lines of Good shit I got dirt rally and not F1 2015, those guys are screwed.  Your insecurities about your purchase are not anyone's problem but your own, and you feel entitled to demand reassurance from people who already took your money and have done nothing but deliver on their promise, on schedule, every month. Have some respect.  EDIT: respect not really applicable in this instance"

dirtgame,3csndv,Hedgey,8,Fri Jul 10 13:22:13 2015 UTC,"Headed over to Simcraft in Marietta, GA yesterday after I was invited to do some testing on the AMP Kart track with RF2. I've driving the AMP Kart track in real life, so this was a great experience to do it on a sim, and a motion sim no less.  After some long testing, I asked if they had DiRT Rally yet? Sean Yoder who runs this portion of Simcraft said; ""Yeah, but we haven't tried it yet, do you want to be a guinea pig??"" I said, ""Sure!!""  He explained that it may not work at all but we should give it a shot. So we went ahead and loaded it up, and HOLY COW. After an initial test run in which I got bucked around like I was at a rodeo, he managed to dial it down quite a bit and get it much more manageable. So he went ahead and loaded up Pike's Peak and guess what, it was raining.  It was a fun experience, and now we are planning on having a ""Rally Day"" at Simcraft with some fun trophies and prizes.  If you're in the Atlanta Area and you want to do this ALL DAY, for a reasonable cost, please let me know as we need at least 15 people total to do so."
dirtgame,3csndv,Magra7hea,2,Fri Jul 10 13:22:36 2015 UTC,Super interested. What are the details? Googling Simcraft doesn't come up with much and doesn't seem publicly accessible a la Dave and Busters.

I think capping the driver count at 15 to 20 max makes sense as we only have a single APEX3 system in the lab currently and I want to make sure everyone gets as much seat time as possible.

Rallycross has always been my second favorite part of the dirt series and I'm super hyped about their partnership with FIA as they host some of the best rallycross events in the world. Can't wait to drive Holjes!
dirtgame,3cvff6,Pure_Decimation,6,Sat Jul 11 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how good the rallycross is IMO.  I mean if is lackluster in almost any regard, then there are a whole bunch of other games out there that are just waiting to eat CM's lunch. The AI, the tracks, the cars, the multi-player, and the format all have to be good, otherwise it is just another meh racing game. HOWEVER if they pull it off, this could really distinguish themselves, and it would be a lot of fun.   All that being said, I love the rally part and would really like the existing countries fleshed out more (like at least double the stage mileage).   Also if anyone from the development team is reading this. Please let us drive any car on any track.  I would love to have a 70s rallycross smack down,or drive my BMW to the top of Pike's peak."

dirtgame,3cvff6,Jackigg,4,Sat Jul 11 07:29:58 2015 UTC,But Hillclimb and Rallycross have similar traits to Rally. I myself look forward to the Rallycross since it allows for wheel-to-wheel action which to me is as fun as taking on a rally stage.

I play at high settings and I get 60fps pretty constantly, sometimes dropping to about 50 briefly. I don't know why your game is not running well, try disabling crossfire and multithreading maybe.

dirtgame,3cpyke,biznology,3,Fri Jul 10 09:17:45 2015 UTC,Furthermore drive more even if you are losing. Also if you destroy the car/retire you still get paid. There is almost no reason to do custom runs.

dirtgame,3cpyke,deadstump,4,Fri Jul 10 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"I have been advocating for a similar idea for a while, a test and tune track. My idea is to have a circuit for each country with terrain and turns similar to the host country with fast, medium, and slow turns. Damage should be shut off or at least be able to respawn a new car at will. The real awesome bit would be to have the ability to change the car's settings just in the pause menu rather than having to reload the whole thing.   Maybe you can have a bit of a tutorial too.  Maybe just a cut screen demonstrating the skill then you go try and every lap it gives you feedback as to how you are doing (""turn in earler"", ""more braking through the corner"", etc.). Obviously you should be able to not be in tutorial mode.   But that is what I have been thinking about."
dirtgame,3cpyke,Crushker,5,Fri Jul 10 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"I love the idea, but my driving feedback would change every stage. Like, ""I'm pretty sure you're going to crash."" Or, ""The brakes are there for a reason"""

Where you are given a sandbox and can drop in whatever surface or turn or obstacle that you want in a small setting to train on, or to create your own gymkhana type course. I think the best correlation would be a ""forge mode"" like Halo has. This is all an un-fleshed out dream though. But one can wish."
dirtgame,3cpyke,brandotgreat,3,Fri Jul 10 06:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yea I thought about this but I feel like it would take a really long time for them to design the editor. They could do a big, flat dirt surface and let you 'draw' a course (cones would be placed on the edges of the tracks where your lines were) and allow you to raise and lower parts of the track. I don't see a full course designer any time in the near future, though. Best they could do on top of the dirt would be to let you drop some trees and rocks down, and maybe let you choose the distant scenery and skybox."
dirtgame,3cpyke,dromtrund,3,Fri Jul 10 06:25:41 2015 UTC,"Like I said, tis but a dream. But it would be a cool adder when/if they run out of courses/modes. The drawing of a course seems like it wouldn't be that much out of the realm with an autocross update (I can't remember if autocross was an upcoming mode or not). I guess I wasn't really thinking of a full course designer but at least like an autocross sized course designer. It seems like an autocross/gymkhana/simple sandbox creator would cross over in effort to develop."
dirtgame,3cpyke,Pure_Decimation,2,Fri Jul 10 07:04:01 2015 UTC,"WRC3 for PS2 had a pretty decent test area, where you had both regular roads with various surfaces, as well as large skidpads, jump tests, a speed ring and similar. That would be a cool way to test different setups and cars"
dirtgame,3cpyke,Astiolo,2,Fri Jul 10 08:03:17 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that rallycross will help a lot with this. It may not be full rally conditions in rally-designed cars, but it should really still help get a good feel for the physics.   Hopefully they'll also let us do custom events on the stages with the current cars as well. Could make for some serious fun and a decent training platform until something more concrete is added."
dirtgame,3cpyke,iktnl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"That would be a pretty good idea. Perhaps they could use a license system like in some other racing games (the one from Gran Turismo comes to mind, but being optional would probably be better). Where they just give you short sections at a time to learn your lines.  Or they could add a rally school mode where it actually simulates some of the things they would get you to start with at a rally school including practicing turns around cones."
dirtgame,3cpyke,aphelionCS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"You can do a custom run and drive at a reasonable speed to get a feel of whichever car you're using at that surface. You should get a lot more confidence once you know how to throw a car around a corner.  As for the Mini, since it's FWD, if you slam the throttle it'll just go whichever direction you're steering. Just don't (heavily) brake while steering since FWDs don't like that."

Only in the replays I noticed it was flat, 2D and not even always at the same position in the same replay. If you rewind and play it again, it might appear further or closer, randomly.  When I was driving the stage, it appeared as in the replay, so I thought I completely hit it, but I passed right through (as the only deceleration was after I tapped the brakes)."

dirtgame,3co8b4,motayba,7,Thu Jul 9 13:10:57 2015 UTC,"Can't wait for this. Thanks for the heads-up, BigLee!  But I have a question (because I'm not familiar with real-life rallycross): I've heard of FIA World Rallycross and Red Bull Global Rallycross. Are they competing organizations? If so, which is the more prominent/popular/prestigious?"
dirtgame,3co8b4,deadstump,10,Thu Jul 9 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Global RallyCross (GRC)  is an American based series. They tend to run on improvised tracks (as opposed to purpose built permanent tracks), the cars are about the same.  I personally like the FIA version better because the improvised tracks of the GRC make for bad racing IMO (they do however bring racing to places where you wouldn't normally have it, like cities)."
dirtgame,3co8b4,motayba,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:01 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for your response. I think it's the GRC that I occasionally see on TV here in the US.
dirtgame,3co8b4,deadstump,2,Thu Jul 9 17:37:13 2015 UTC,NBC has it on I believe.
dirtgame,3co8b4,blankdeck31,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:08 2015 UTC,Yea thanks to GRC I was able to go to my first RallyX race in NYC however the track was set up in the parking lot of the Nassau Collesem and it was the same layout as one used some other time in the season.
dirtgame,3co8b4,puluminati,3,Thu Jul 9 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"The Rules and Points System is somewhat diffrent aswell in GRC drivers get points for heat wins fastest qualifying and then for the end result after the final, while in FIA Championship all the (4) heats will give you points aswell as the semifinals and final races. Red Bull GRC also has something called the ""Last Chace Qualifier"" (LCQ) where those who havent made it to the final (or at least those who missed it by 1-2 positions) will be able to race for a few remaing spots in the final. And another diffrence is the joker, both have one but other then in the World Rallycross Championship in Red Bull GRC the joker is actually a shortcut and saves you some time making it good for planning an overtake.  Usually people (espacially Europeans) like the FIA Championship more. I myself prefer the Europeans tracks too, but Red Bull Grc is quite intresting aswell, and the drivers there are very good to, some names you might know or remeber (Ken Block, Tanner Foust, Scott Speed, Nelson Piquet Jr., Patrik Sandell, and a lot more  ) And one more thing to the tracks, some of the GRC ones are quite nice too, a few of them are not that improvised as a lot of people think.  So in the end it's deffinelty worth checking out both Championships.  here the latest race from GRC in case you're intrested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_6J7arcFs The Fia World Rallycross Championship has a YT channel to where you can watch the latest stuff going on."
dirtgame,3co8b4,deadstump,4,Thu Jul 9 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to defend myself a bit.  I have no problem with the GRC (I know that some people seem to have a serious case of ""everything in Europe is better"" syndrome, the only reason I like the FIA version better is that often the GRC's tracks end up a parade where the joker is the only real place to pass.  They tend to be less flow to the tracks and more of a fast straight to a sharp corner. There are some exceptions, and when they rear their gorgeous heads there is some good racing. Another issue I have (had?) with the GRC is that they allow a lot more dirty racing (Piquet  (sp?) I am looking at you) than the FIA.  For a while there everyone was just taking lines expecting to be hit and spun, it really made the racing boring."
dirtgame,3co8b4,puluminati,2,Thu Jul 9 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, i actually agree with you for the most parts. As you said that ""racing in america sucks"" thing is just what i don't like to hear (not that you have said that), we have (or had) that with Ken Block aswell, in the beginning everyone called him a bad driver (lots of people still do) because he did those youtube videos and crashed a couple of times in his first 2 WRC seasons, but then in his 3rd and 4th year he actually scored quite a few points and could match and race with the other (european) privateers, getting like 6th and 7th behind the manufacturer teams .Anyways I think you always have to remember that in Europe Rallycross is a thing since ages ago. While the American RX Series is only what? 4 or 5 years old, and in my opinion it has become a lotter better then it was 2-3 years ago. They still need to learn how to make their tracks and rules a bit better, but they going in a good direction."
dirtgame,3co8b4,handsomeassWIhipster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with GRC right now, besides the leeway they have with overly aggressive drivers, is NBC coverage and their take on the series. I always felt ESPN was far kinder to the fans (yes commentators rarely knew what they were doing) where we had live streams (NBC sports live extra is not an effective alternative) and there was just a blatant passion in the drivers and press. I remember in the final year of ESPN's coverage, we had YAER providing awesome media coverage, ESPN live streams were incredibly simple and fun to watch, and the course selection was somehow still more diverse and varied than Red Bull's in 2014. It feels like the series was evolving, but has since come to a standstill and even downgraded since Red Bull and NBC took over. The WRX on the other hand only appears to get more accessible to Americans (I've missed GRC races aplenty due to my work shift, but why is it that NBC isn't considering marketing it better or offering these original online methods to watch for the original fans like before? Its frustrating Europe caters to me better than a formerly prominent online racing series does) and with full race weekends, larger fields, and far less ""cheap"" fighting between drivers on the track, I feel the GRC is stuck at a standstill as America's half assed answer to the WRX. I'll only say I had more fun watching the X Games this year thus far.   Props to WRX for getting game exposure and coverage though! I can only hope that as messy as this year is, GRC goes to Forza or the like. No matter how messed up the series is in comparison to its earlier season, I'm still a fan."

dirtgame,3co8b4,dsiOneBAN2,2,Thu Jul 9 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited for what the PvP update could be, it'd be possible to run a full World RX weekend in less than an hour with 40 people without modifying the FIA's format at all (too many entrants and the heat qualifying points system would have to be modified). Simultaneous heats and semifinals make it possible.  I'm imagining race weekends on the weekend being run every hour or so on the online events page... people gather in a 40-man lobby, get randomly split into groups of 5 for the first heat, then come back to the lobby afterwards to do service/change tires/chat and get their next group of 5 based on the first heat. Repeat that a couple of times then go on to semifinals and finals, dropping the players who couldn't make it (or allow them to spectate? I imagine there's a limit there though).  The best part is that many people already did play like this in previous Dirt games (and just about every MP racing game ever), a bunch of short races in one play session rather than one long one. It's the same thing with a meta structure to it that makes it feel like you're racing 40 people instead of 4 thanks to heats being won on times."

One thing I really disagree with is your number 10; mirror stages. It just feel like a very cheap and very virtual way to add content and I'm pretty sure it would be really boring. Besides, stages are the way they are because they are inspired by real rally stages. I just don't see the point."

dirtgame,3cnk16,deadstump,8,Thu Jul 9 10:47:18 2015 UTC,"Leagues and custom events, I would be somewhat ok with, but I really don't want to see them in championships or online events.

dirtgame,3cnk16,lifeandthensome,6,Thu Jul 9 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"But we are already running the same stages again and again with the championship and online, by the end of a monthly or a masters between the shorts and longs I have run  every stage twice. Adding the mirrored stages would be a quick way to get a little diversity so that I would have a little tougher time memorizing the stages.  Sure new stages would be better, but if I could get the mirrored ones soon I am all for it."

Just as Empty Box stated the tarmac handling is stupid, full grip to no grip, barely no in between, it tbh feels completely arcade mode FFB is still a bit meh without some modded .xml and i do link this to physics. For stages that have ruts or similar, id like to be able to feel those, and for the physics to pull the car (anyone remember those stages with ruts in RBR that would pull the car over!), this currently doesn't exist in Dirt Rally Some of the cars still feel too slow to me under full throttle, like there is traction control or something under the hood. The WRC and Group B cars should be scary fast! This also ties into the Greek stages, which i like the layouts of but good grief its like driving in deep sand. The cars just lug way too much around there. Tire compounds and tire wear across stages are also much needed!

dirtgame,3cqkrn,Pure_Decimation,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:52:42 2015 UTC,"Loving this game so far, but I have noticed some severe inconsistencies in terminal damage. I've seen it posted on here before, but figured I'd post my own example.  The game was even nice enough to reset me back to the track. Minor 14 second penalty and a decent pace at the start of the stage finished me in 3rd. Just finished the rest of the rally in 1st on master difficulty in my little kit car."
dirtgame,3cqkrn,gradeso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:54:35 2015 UTC,I agree that the damage in this game is a little too forgiving but I don't think you would have died from that. you slowed down to 60 MPH before going off the edge of the road and have a really strong roll cage.   Here's a high speed rally crash where the driver and co-driver made it out unscathed. Although they didn't hit any trees.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WZ-HRfk9vQ
dirtgame,3cqkrn,StimpyBoy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"That didn't honestly appear to be that ""deadly"". As a (former?) rally driver, the worst accident types are ones to a dead stop. i.e. in a high speed section and go straight off into a solid tree. Worse yet are high speed side collisions into something solid, like sliding sideways into a tree at high speed. The roll cage is mainly weakest for intrusion on the sides, despite most door bar designs being refined over the years.  I went off at about maybe 60 - 80 km/h dead on into a foot-wide tree (relatively small), snapped it off and landed on our side. Also that was down a 10 foot drop. The co-driver & I both walked away fine. The car, not so much."

Easiest place to test it is custom games, when you do one of these tracks, it won't save it, won't overwrite your personal best and won't give you the achievement for beating the delta time. Also it will disconnect you from  racenet, only restarting the game fixes it.

Almost always ends up causing me to crash.  Audio stuttering wasn't there before but started with one of the pre-Germany patches.  Does this on any of the standard settings, except for Ultra Low.

Is it because the dirt on the track and their tires makes it slippery enough for that approach to work, compared with the more traditional approach to taking a tarmac corner?"
dirtgame,3cl7h2,crazyjockey,3,Thu Jul 9 07:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think because they have tires adapted for both gravel and asphalt at the same time, so on asphalt tires don't keep surface like they should so they go sideways and because like you said the dirt applied from the other sections of the track, also the suspension is too soft for asphalt races so taking corners like that is faster.

dirtgame,3clyrk,Pure_Decimation,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the G27. It's not exactly fancy but it is comprehensive and reasonably priced. The G27 is gear driven which may make it feel just a bit off set and it is not quite as powerful as a belt driven wheel (as I understand it) but it's still very solid.  When you are looking at buying a fancy piece of kit like a force feedback steering wheel, it's important that you go easy when you are getting into the hobby. You might buy a $500 wheel that works really well with all the bells and whistles, but it also may end up collecting dust while it sits in your closet.  So yeah, G27 is a good buy."

From what I understand, the T300RS has the better wheel and ffb, while the G27 has better pedals (also clutch and H shifter, but I don't really care about those since most racecars are sequential now). Price is almost the same where I live. You decide what's more important for you."
dirtgame,3clyrk,dgeesio,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:47:58 2015 UTC,as with anything its how much money you have to spend on a wheel. the DFGT is a great entry wheel.i do top ten times daily with it on all tracks.

But I swear I've had times where the car felt different. One time during practice, there was a rock on the road going into a turn that I had learned to avoid. When I went to do the daily, the rock wasn't there. Now, in the events where you need to own the car, I'm assuming it uses your version of the car, so upgrades are taken into account in that case."

dirtgame,3cjcrg,RedHairNoCares,2,Wed Jul 8 12:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think the rock was there because when you're doing a custom event there's certain parameters that don't change even after a restart. Say you crash and it throws a rock onto the middle of the stage(idk if that's even possible, it had to have happened to me though), it will be there after a restart. If your weather is set to overcast, the stage might start raining after 10 mins of practice and the only way to get rid of it is by making a new custom event.    I like the idea of having to adapt, but at the same time the littlest things can throw me off so it's very annoying practicing for so long and then failing. But like I said who knows maybe it's all in my head."

dirtgame,3cgmv8,NecesitoSubaru,5,Tue Jul 7 20:11:37 2015 UTC,I save a tenth if I go over the rock.   After getting it right on the 50th try. Worth it.

dirtgame,3cgmv8,spodermanSWEG,3,Wed Jul 8 06:42:41 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I imagine it's not too easy. Looks like OP had about a near perfect set up to get over it and then, due to the resulting speed needed, over drove the next corner. Getting it right to actually save time could be near impossible.  TL;DR Just stay mid."
dirtgame,3cisye,EkkuZakku,3,Wed Jul 8 06:16:26 2015 UTC,This is very interesting!
dirtgame,3cisye,RuneRuler,2,Wed Jul 8 13:17:59 2015 UTC,"Since you're tracking the current gear in AHK, do you run into issues when it gets out of sync with the game (resulting in jumping 2 gears at a time for instance)?"
dirtgame,3cisye,billiamthesecond,2,Wed Jul 8 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"Kinda, it can be an issue when you load a new stage, when you finished the last one in 6th gear. The current gear in the script is still 6, so you will have to shift down (or use the N key to switch to Neutral in R-N-1-2-etc) to get to 1st. I'm sure it could be customized a bit to avoid this, but I haven't thought of a way to yet.  As for skipping 2 gears, I haven't had that issue, since the gear number in the script is the gear you're going to get in-game."
dirtgame,3cisye,RuneRuler,3,Wed Jul 8 16:06:20 2015 UTC,Could you post the script once you are satisfied with it; I use AHK but I am not good at creating scripts.
dirtgame,3cgpiz,dwkGravey,16,Tue Jul 7 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"I think the author makes some good general points about the atmosphere in the game. I agree the menus err on the side of sterile, but I still love how clean they are, so I'm not sure what a solution there could be.  This is something I'd love to see, however:   Cars crash and break down along the stages. With each passing car, damage is done to the roads, and dust is thrown into the air. In order to be a groundbreaking rally game, Dirt Rally needs to capture this aspect of rallying. I know that it can be done because Codemasters featured several cars on one stage in Dirt 3 and the Dirt Rally physics engine allows for several cars with the Rallycross expansion coming later this month. In addition, having crashed cars randomly placed on a stage was done 10 years ago by Evolution Studios in the WRC series on the PS2. Think about the possibilities. Say for example, a competitor in front of you suffered a puncture and you began to catch the dust. It would force you to make a decision: do you keep going and take risks to pass the stricken car, or hold back and lose time over the length of the stage."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,UberMudkipz,6,Tue Jul 7 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love this idea. Dirt 3 also had some more atmospheric elements that made the game a little more interesting. You'd see spectators run across the road, and camera men move from the sides.   The real time AI cars suggestion is perfect though, and I would love to see it implemented."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,tru3gam3r,2,Tue Jul 7 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"The menus were also awesome, and I personally really enjoy the campaign both dirt 3 and grid had."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,Annoying_Arsehole,6,Wed Jul 8 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"I just hope they'll do some kind of iRacing style safety rating for WRX to prevent it from turning into a total shit show from people driving into wrong direction, crashing into others on purpose etc. Sure some contact should be allowed but purposefully causing others to spin, blocking etc. should be punished.  iRacing is the only racing game I play online simply because its strictness makes it possible to have 12 Nascar sprint cars on a 0.4 mile oval without it turning into a total clusterfuck usually, though of course even there you have fucknuts who've had a few too many beers and don't pay attention to their lines causing accidents now and then.  If something like this isn't implemented any good multiplayer will only be found in some leagues that actively manage people who're allowed in, outside that it will be mostly dead."

dirtgame,3cgpiz,A1rHorn,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:03 2015 UTC,"The above and longer stages are the only things this game is wanting for. If the stages degraded over time, got rutted and just broke apart more it would add so much replayability."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,SkitTrick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:35:35 2015 UTC,I think this would also help to keep the stages fresh
dirtgame,3cgpiz,SkitTrick,8,Wed Jul 8 00:53:12 2015 UTC,"However, my only gripe with Codemaster’s stage selection in Dirt Rally is that they have fallen into the same mistakes of past rally games: recycled roads. Now, I know that in real life, the WRC uses the same stages several times during a rally. However, those stages are 20-40 kilometers long. In Dirt Rally, the stages are significantly shorter, and this makes them easy to memorize with time. Because Codemasters put so much time into the detail of the roads as I outlined above, it does increase the re-playability of the stages. However, the advertized 12 stages per rally is actually only one 15-20 kilometer stretch of road that is broken up into several sections and run in both directions. When I realized this, I have to say that I felt more than a little cheated. I know that Codemasters will still be adding more rallies and stages, but at the moment, the current collection of stages isn’t enough. My only hope is that the developers will continue to add stages as DLC once the early access period has been completed. I think that I can speak for many rally enthusiasts that if more stages were created with the same quality and attention to detail as the rest of the game, we would be willing to open up our wallets to acquire them. Just like the cars in Dirt Rally, the stage quality is there, but I think that we could use some more quantity moving forward.   Nailed it."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,iktnl,8,Wed Jul 8 00:53:40 2015 UTC,"Great review! To add another thing I really miss from CMR04: when you're in the service area for repairs, you actually saw your car there, with all the damage. Fixing the suspension made the car sit higher again or made it less saggy. Fixing the bodywork was visible immediately. There were mechanics surrounding your car doing idle fixy animations. Small tiny details but it felt much less sterile. I'm sure it's possible, the stage is previewing in real time in the background already. Add a car and move to a stationary point with the car in view when in repairs?  Also, track detoriation would be nice. If you go first, you'll get a pretty nice track to drive in, but if you're last and in soggy rainy Wales, being last makes you need to keep the road conditions in mind. I wouldn't mind it in career mode. It can stay now this in Online events though, fair competition and all that."
dirtgame,3cgpiz,XmattbeeX,4,Wed Jul 8 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"Sadly the 2 biggest issues would require a large amount of resources to develop (much longer stages, and real ai instead of made up times for competitors on rally stages) so I'm not holding out any hope of them being implemented. Maybe in Dirt Rally 2 in 2017/18 ;)"
dirtgame,3cgpiz,carkid37,3,Wed Jul 8 12:42:24 2015 UTC,I feel like this review pretty much sums up the entire community's thoughts on DiRT Rally.  Except for mod support ;)
dirtgame,3cgpiz,englishbyname,3,Wed Jul 8 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"Fully agreed with this review, it's pinpointed what needs improving perfectly. I've always felt something wasn't quite there but wasn't sure how to describe it. This review hits the nail on the head.  Please take this onboard /u/justbiglee and Codies! You can make a great rally game into a perfect rally game. :)"
dirtgame,3cgpiz,Weerm,2,Wed Jul 8 07:48:52 2015 UTC,"Great review! I love this game already but I agree with everything said. About the atmosphere, the championships mostly feel like some thing where you drive and post your time to some place.  Even small updates to how this is done could go a long way. Having some of the cars you are driving against driving before and after you though... that would be fantastic.  Although, unless they plan to update this game for a while rather than making a new one after early access, the game will win more focusing on cars, stages and other features."

Think about every corner you take, did you use too little road, were you too early on the brakes(forcing you to not step on the gas a split second or more), too lenient on the gas?  Sometimes I can be 10-15 seconds slower against the elite difficulty. On my best track I can be 10-20 seconds faster against the Masters difficulty."

A lot of races on my better stages such as most of wales and some of greece I will lead for most of the race only to make a small mistake and come in second.

dirtgame,3cf718,Dark_Egg,3,Thu Jul 9 08:59:46 2015 UTC,"Recovering adds 5 seconds to whatever is remaining on your automatic recovery timer (starts at 10 seconds). Making a mistake is fine, but going off course generally is not. A mistake is taking a corner way too wide or applying too much throttle on exit, costing you milliseconds. Going off course costs you a position or even the entire stage (in the case of Monte Carlo), so you REALLY want to try to play it safe. The more you play and listen to the pacenotes, the more you'll understand exactly how fast you're able to go through certain corners without catapulting off the stage."
dirtgame,3cf718,22quack,4,Thu Jul 9 09:18:57 2015 UTC,"Most of it is just practice, but there are some exceptions,  stages where the AI will beat you to the ground (third split abies koilada I think?),  and there are some others where the AI is really slow (monte carlo sprint with the snowy second half)."
dirtgame,3cf718,Razon,3,Tue Jul 7 14:42:44 2015 UTC,Would you agree that the AI needs to be tuned a bit? The fact that we can pick out spots where the AI is slow and spots where the AI is fast leads me to believe some tuning is in the cards for the future.
dirtgame,3cf718,AwesomeeExpress,3,Tue Jul 7 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Sure it needs fine tuning, but it doesn't need to be slower. If anything I would argue faster, since my first race I haven't placed lower than 3rd but I have a lot of sim experience, just practice."

dirtgame,3cdaj5,SiddTheVicious,2,Tue Jul 7 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"With the new PC is this a fresh Windows installation?   How old is the power supply?   What seems to be happening is that when the track starts it's when the GPU really starts working. So it's when the driver crashes or its when the PSU can't handle the extra power load (I've actually seen this before and this is the way we found the PSU was bad).  However, do you play any other graphic intensive games on this PC? If so and they run fine, then it's going to most likely be a driver issue."
dirtgame,3cdaj5,SiddTheVicious,3,Tue Jul 7 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"It must be the drivers then, the power supply is not old and I'm able to run games like wither 3, shadow of mordor, arma 3 all on full gfx without issues"
dirtgame,3cdaj5,GTOfire,2,Tue Jul 7 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah its the drivers then. When you made the new PC did you do a fresh install of Windows? If not, you're going to be chasing gremlins forever and you should just format now and save time.   If it is a fresh install, then use DDU to uninstall your drivers. Then reinstall the drivers."

I think it is how I played when I had the original dirt. However I very quickly simply bought a controller, the game is much more fun. Than later take the step to wheel if you can't afford one right now..."
dirtgame,3cfdma,Procrastinator_5000,-4,Tue Jul 7 14:17:40 2015 UTC,That doesn't really help since only tapping the accel in this car gives it a great burst of power causing it to lose control. I've driven other cars with keyboards before and none of them feels the same as the FWD.
dirtgame,3cfdma,kakkela,3,Tue Jul 7 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"Car you are driving in video is RWD, not FWD.  It just got so much power for two wheels, havent played with keyboard but in some games there is sensitivity slider that could help.

dirtgame,3cfdma,optimatorz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:53:11 2015 UTC,After several other plays with this car I've decided to stick to the normal level of sensitivity. Gently tapping the throttle is the key.
dirtgame,3cfdma,vmusars,3,Tue Jul 7 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips:  1. Taps on accelerator as /u/Procrastinator_5000 says  2. Don't touch gas if you touch the grass (coast off first)  3. Take things slower  4. Be wary of downshifting while cornering.  On tarmac it can really upset your back wheels on RWD.  5. Seriously though, it's only $27.61, and is useful for more than just this game. edit:  I'd think traction control and stability control might be worth it on keyboard, but haven't tried it personally."

dirtgame,3cbjlx,hutchie97,7,Mon Jul 6 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think this has been asked before but we never came to a definitive conclusion. But you're right, both 'long' sections stop (or start, depending which way you're going) where the other ends. You can google-maps the real-world area to see this.  So theoretically, yes, you could have a EXTRA long Monte Carlo stage, but it may be impractical for a number of reasons (size of game-world and memory constraints, difficulty of such a long course, etc). We'll probably never know until Codies pitches in."
dirtgame,3cbjlx,itsCrisp,3,Mon Jul 6 19:50:44 2015 UTC,Codies have stated previously that stage length is restricted by the engine they're using. So no long stages.

dirtgame,3cbjlx,CavCavTHESatNav,3,Mon Jul 6 21:49:08 2015 UTC,I'd definitely love if they added a stage that used the full top of the Col de Turini although it's great sliding through the last corner knowing you won't lose time
dirtgame,3cbjlx,CavCavTHESatNav,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:40:19 2015 UTC,But then you could do that for both corners - twice the fun! And wasn't it available as a stage in DiRT 3 as well?

dirtgame,3ce19s,DodoBenz,2,Tue Jul 7 04:33:49 2015 UTC,its just a case of getting the right settings for what matches how you like it. they are there.  i have a dfgt and set very fast times in all cars all tracks.the ffb is fine.  i would make sure you have centering on 100 in logitech profiler.also turn down tourque alignment.
dirtgame,3ce19s,dgeesio,3,Tue Jul 7 08:05:20 2015 UTC,"Do you mean lower the self-aligning torque value in the game? Cause I personally have and would recommend the exact opposite :p My logitech centering spring is at 0% and the self-aligning torque is at maximum. The reason for that is that there is no centering spring in the cars you're driving, and it's the self-aligning torque which gives the wheel this behavior similar to a centering spring. But self-aligning torque is a force applied depending on actual simulation state, whereas a centering spring is just a dumb constant spring."

And I'm using the same wheel as you - DFGT. Perhaps this effect was suppressing less pronounced ones that you would get from suspension and wheels on straights."

dirtgame,3c9dhb,Shmink_,-3,Mon Jul 6 10:12:53 2015 UTC,I really miss the rewind feature of previous Dirt games for practicing a particular section or turn in custom mode.

dirtgame,3c9dhb,lifeandthensome,8,Mon Jul 6 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"Drive 3 minutes to this particular turn that is good for practicing Scandinavian flick or this section of hairpins, restart and drive 3 minutes again etc. It is just more time consuming to practice without a benefit. Just enable it in custom mode and do not count any runs with rewind in any leader board, don't give points/money, do not count it for progression etc.  What exactly is the horrible, horrible tragedy in that?"
dirtgame,3c9dhb,greatestname,6,Mon Jul 6 13:07:01 2015 UTC,rather they just make a test track with different corners and reset points?
dirtgame,3c9dhb,lifeandthensome,5,Mon Jul 6 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"That too. I think they have some kind of rally school in mind and last I heard they said something like they do not want to just make a parking lot with cones type of thing.  Still, being able to easily repeat some part of the real track quickly to find a good way to drive them would be really handy. It is not like you can't do it already, it is just very time consuming to reset from the very beginning every time.  Or even make a new ""practice event"" mode that is ""custom event"" but with rewinds. Add to that an ability to change the car setup on the fly and it would be glorious. And not confusing to users who might otherwise wonder why those things do not work in real races.  Add a way to mark start/end points for a custom timer, and you could see if the changes in your driving and car setup make you faster or not."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,greatestname,3,Mon Jul 6 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"I would probably prefer some kind of training mode to go through specific turns. Either a training track, or you choose where on an existing track you want to start and finish, and you just work on that one turn."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,AllezCannes,2,Mon Jul 6 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"i've suggested this several times. a ""setup/practice"" mode where you could drive on a large surface and maybe put out some cones.   or a mode where you can drive how you want without being reset automatically. the ability to have a car that never breaks and you are allowed to drive the wrong way so you can drive to the beginning of the part of the stage you want to practice."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,najtrows,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:57:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there's little to stop them from creating training stages that are comprised entirely of 3 lefts for example."

dirtgame,3c9dhb,greatestname,-3,Mon Jul 6 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"'t give points/mone   Just no... its like turning on godmode... While 1% of ppl would actually use it for practicing, other 99% of players would use it to fix their mistakes and then forget about that...  I have to count myself into the 99%, and with all honesty, I do not want this option to be in the game, because I would get lazy. This way when I am driving for 3 minutes, I start getting anxious that I must not do a mistake, which has its important part in the game. With the option of rewind, this 'fear' of crashing would disappear."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,Zheiko,2,Mon Jul 6 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"other 99% of players would use it to fix their mistakes and then forget about that...   I do not understand what you mean by that.    This way when I am driving for 3 minutes, I start getting anxious that I must not do a mistake, which has its important part in the game. With the option of rewind, this 'fear' of crashing would disappear.   You still have that for when you do races for progression, leagues and challenges.  In any case, if you personally do not like it, turn it off in the options. Done."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,greatestname,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:09:26 2015 UTC,"he means the fear of crashing not existing affects how you drive. If you know you can just reset the last 5 seconds, you can go ape-shit through a hairpin and hope for the best. If you sail off the edge of the cliff you just rewind and go again. If you don't have that option you'll be more careful and if you choose not to be careful you'll feel much more tense going ape-shit, knowing a fuckup means your event ends there.  Sure you can turn it off in the options, but just like you get to state your opinion that you'd like this feature, everyone else can state their opinion that they'd rather not have it. In the end coding time isn't unlimited and you can't include every feature with an option to toggle it on and off for those who want and don't want it. Creating a rewind means coding time not spent on other features, and the more people that don't want rewinds, the better for the game it would be to not bother creating it even as an option."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,GTOfire,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:26:34 2015 UTC,"If you sail off the edge of the cliff you just rewind and go again.   Yes, this is what training is. As said, when rewind is only in training mode that has no impact on your game progression, I see no problem with that. I am not advocating for a rewind for the ""real"" races like in previous Dirt games.   Creating a rewind means coding time not spent on other features,   Codemasters already recognized the demand for some kind of training mode (like the rally school in RBR), and a rewind feature is one way to do it. And effort wise, it might even be relative cheap, as previous games had it and Dirt Rally is built on the same engine (you even still see references to rewind in various xml files leftover from Dirt 3)."
dirtgame,3c9dhb,greatestname,0,Mon Jul 6 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"The fact that a feature exists in previous iterations does not in any way guarantee it's easy to implement again. It could be, certainly, perhaps that code has been maintained and kept alive all along and it's a matter of small tweaks to get it up and running. But it's just as possible that the code was removed a while ago when it was in the way of creating some other new feature, since even code that is dormant still requires work to maintain when you touch your engine in any fundamental way.  Hell, it's possible that somewhere along the line they refactored their engine significantly (which given the massive change from arcade physics to simulation physics doesn't seem a big stretch) and had to make a choice between high complexity at a core level (where high complexity can really bite you in the ass months later) or cut support for ever rewinding again. Not saying it's the case, just saying it could be, there's no guarantee either way.  Also, a rewind option doesn't train or teach anything. It's not a viable replacement for a proper rally school because it does not tell, show or in any other way provide you with the proper technique to take a particular type of corner or obstacle. It just lets you slam your head into it repeatedly until you come up with some way that you sort of guess works the best. RBR rally school was much more useful in teaching you the ropes by actually explaining stuff and then giving you tailor made courses to train it with a measurable rate of success.  A rewind feature does nothing but reinforce bad habits and discourage proper practice. Racing and especially rallying is about flowing along the track and understanding the core fundamentals behind it all. Rewind and take a particular corner endlessly all you want, an hour of attempts later you'll be stellar at taking that particular corner with that exact entry angle and that exact entry speed perfectly. Next time you perform that stage you'll take the previous corner a bit different and you'll be coming in at a different angle and 20kph faster, leaving your entire hour of 'training' absolutely pointless."

dirtgame,3cafk1,blackrabt,5,Mon Jul 6 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"Its gonna sound dumb but have you turned all the assists off? Seriously. Turn them off. ABS is ok but turn the others off.  It might be that you're being too harsh on the throttle or turn-in with corners. Let it drift through longer corners and apply throttle when the car is more in line with itself. If you're struggling with the Escort or have ended up picking the Stratos (that'll be the problem), try the Opel or Fiat. They're a little less back endy."

dirtgame,3cb96f,Lari-Fari,3,Mon Jul 6 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing, a bit of cheating though, not too realistic, perhaps I should map it to the right side paddle to be more on the simulation side."
dirtgame,3cb96f,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:53:33 2015 UTC,Hmm. You may be right. Would it be against official rally rules to mod your car and put the handbrake left IRL? :-P
dirtgame,3cb96f,Lari-Fari,5,Mon Jul 6 16:00:35 2015 UTC,well then you wouldn't have hands left for the wheel and doing hairpins by steering with your knees is reasonably tricky. The analog handbrake requires quite a bit of force to use.

dirtgame,3cb96f,Rotic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:57:34 2015 UTC,I don't have that wheel (old logitech momo racing) but I use my old Microsoft sidewinder FFB 2 joystick as a handbrake. I have a highly technical solution to keep it in forward position:  a rubber band. Then I just pull the stick back when setting up the handbrake button and it takes the joystick's axis instead. It works really well and I've found it to be much better than only having on/off type handbrake you normally get with buttons.   Earlier my hand braking attempts were rather sad but now hairpins are much more enjoyable to drive as I can just apply handbrake as little as I need to and can vary the strength as I'm sliding.

dirtgame,3caeum,redpiano,5,Mon Jul 6 10:44:48 2015 UTC,"I did 50ish hours in this game with an X360 controller before finally fixing my G25 wheel last week, so I can leave a comment here.  always played with 0 assists and manual gears  No matter how clean my stages were with the controller I would be 30 seconds behind the top times online (on sprints) or over a minute on long stages. Still good xp on the daily (near the top of the bar) but no chance of being noticed. In championships against the AI the best I could hope for in masters was 5th or 6th place and pray the AI guys above all crash out (happened once).  With the wheel, immediately I'm winning most the stages across a 12 stage masters rally against AI. So certainly a big improvement for me.  AND it makes it easier (feeling the grip of the road very important on ice) and obviously the more delicate/accurate controls. Flicking and a touch of handbrake to get around hairpins and acute corners is SO MUCH more fun (because it's not impossible now).  I can't comment on the fact you don't have many clean runs, I'd suggest that's because you're pushing too hard, so that might improve with a wheel. But saying that, I am crashing rather a lot with the wheel while getting used to the fact I can never be lazy about correcting going off line.  The ONLY downside is it's a pain to set it all up."

Group B with a controller is really hard, it's the only group where I turn automatic shifting on, because there's way too much stuff happening to handle shifting, too (at least for me). Also RWD cars, I just don't drive those.  Try these settings: steering Sensitivity 100, linearity 0, deadzone 20%  And yeah, I can't do scandinavian flicks, I just handbrake into hairpins.

dirtgame,3caeum,xscz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"I rarely have a clean run   I haven't got dirt rally but I play Raceroom Racing Experience (another racing sim, track oriented though) with a controller and I find it really hard to do full laps of difficult circuits without spinning out.  I discovered that the problem is actually with the controller and not me. The settings in RRE have a really nifty accelerometer/braking deadzone editor that shows the exact level of input on the xbox controller triggers. It turns out that only the middle 50% of the trigger pull are registered. Let me explain:   The first quarter depress of the trigger gives NO input to the game. The next 50% pull of the trigger is your range of 0 accelerator pedal push, to floored out accelerator pedal push.  The last 25% of the trigger pull is already completely maxed out so it has no change on the car. Exactly the same with the brake trigger.   So what this means is that while you THINK you aren't yet at max/min throttle you already are, so your reactions are delayed without you knowing it. Attempting to be gentle and gentle with your accelerate/brake inputs, is actually messed up and you just cant be accurate with it. Balancing your triggers within the middle 50% of the depress just isn't manageable.  RRE is free on steam so you can download it to test your controllers dead zones yourself if you like. I also discovered that my controllers sticks, when flicked, will not even reset to total center, they sit at about 0-3% left or right after springing back, so I can't even let my car drive in a straight line on its own. I believe these issues are the root of the problem with controllers in racing sims. I can't afford a wheel right know but I know it will help a ton when I do."

Firstly i have a standard X360 controller and in Assetto Corsa it shows the trigger impulse in the bottom left for the full range of each trigger (which i noticed recently enough to remember). Also if you goto Control Panel>Devices & Printers right click on your controller and goto 'Game Controller Setting' then Properties you can see all your buttons and axis impulse, including triggers which occupy the +(1/2)Z for left and -(1/2)Z for right. Perhaps you have an amount of deadzone set in RRE or else something is off with your specific controller, but you can check in the above to see your own controllers impulse and callibrate if necessary Edit: Or run joy.cpl"

The visual and aural feedback in FM4 is the best I've ever experienced in a racing game. I always felt like I knew exactly where the car was going and how close to the limit I was by the sight of the camera shake and sound of the tires.  Your point about the vibration feedback is well-made too. I remember Rallisport Challenge 2 was constant vibration, whether it's telling you you're on the line, or in trouble. Dirt Rally seems to take the attitude that ""no feedback is good feedback"", but when you're running over gravel, even if on line, the car/controller should still be telling you something haptically. I've turned up the vibration gain to the max (150%?) to try and make up for that, but that's not a great substitute."

dirtgame,3c5qrq,raphyr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Modders will always add content to racing games when they can, but the quality of that content varies.   I can't find anything that says the stages in the game are taken directly from actual rally stages, i.e. turn by turn and what have you. They are obviously based off of real rallies and feature very similar terrain, landmarks and the like, but the amount of work required to make a stage based off of a real stage is a lot less than trying to recreate the stage itself.     Now, I'm not saying it's not work. It'd be a lot of work to basically double or triple the amount of content in each area already available, and it obviously compounds with each new area they add, but I feel like it the benefits would be worth it. Each stage would be much more complete, and at the later stages of the game you are facing some decent challenges of endurance to finish a full rally. It would just go a long way to make the game more complete and 'realistic', in my view."

I find his voice pretty monotone too, some more emphasis on slow corners and cautions would be a great improvement!"
dirtgame,3byvyy,sketchyterry,11,Fri Jul 3 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely the timing of some of the calls but even more so for me is the ability to edit what numbers are given to a corner. For example some corners which are called a 4 right are at best a 3 right, maybe even 2. So being able to edit that and allow people to effectively share pace notes around the web so you could load it into your game would be awesome.  I do agree on his voice partly, I don't find it as big as an issue but again would be cool if people could maybe create their own voice packs and share those around."
dirtgame,3byvyy,batador,7,Fri Jul 3 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think the worse corner is that last corner in Greece after the uphill hairpin. No way it's a Right 4. I always forget about it, listen to the co-driver and drive off a cliff right in front of the finish line."
dirtgame,3byvyy,willi_werkel,2,Sun Jul 5 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, editing the calls would be great, sometimes he says sharp right instead of hairpin, but its always a hairpin (altough it adds variety)"
dirtgame,3byvyy,22quack,5,Sat Jul 4 19:59:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. The main issue I have is in consecutive corners where the driver will finish saying the pacenote for the first turn, but will not have time to tell me the entirety of the second pacenote until I'm already entering the corner.  I haven't had a chance to see this in Germany since I haven't played it yet, but this is a problem no matter how early you set the pacenotes T_T  Need an option for faster speech from the co-driver, or allow overlapping pacenotes (one pacenote begins speech before the other finishes)."

But seriously, I'm sure you've already read about my love for Evos and my desire to have them in game, but I have another suggestion.  MOD SUPPORT  I personally think that it would be a great route for you guys to go down. If you're looking for the game to be played for even half as long as RBR (Richard Burns Rally) has been around I think you should explore this option. I don't, however, want you to rely on mods like other games (rFactor) but I think the community can produce some really great content, especially with Race Track Builder in development (and potentially being released soon?). RTB is being currently going through the Steam Greenlight process, and if it passes, I can see some great implementation and Steam Workshop capabilities. I can understand if maybe you won't allow modded cars in online events, because not everyone has the capability of generating proper physics for said car. However, you guys could allow the community to add tracks for online and single player events. I would also like to see a system where when people add liveries to cars they don't have to replace an existing one, it literally adds a new livery.  You guys are doing great work as usual, keep it up!!  PS. I really love the ding that sounds when a stage has loaded!"

dirtgame,3byvyy,jay1441,5,Fri Jul 3 08:54:32 2015 UTC,"I know this is a major thing, but a ""recce"" mode would be fantastic.  Let us run the stages with a speed limiter, then pause as needed and assign values to corners.  Then in 2nd pass you can then assign exactly on the course the calls take place for each corner.  All we'd need from a voice standpoint is pretty much what's already in there but you can add more fun stuff as small voice clips that are selectable as you go through.  As time goes on, you build your library of your recce notes if you desire, then as you go back to each stage you can tweak as you go from car to car or something as needed.  Another thing that us real rallyists can do on stage is say the word ""next"" to our codriver, then they go to the next call.  What about a button assignment to immediately say the next call?"
dirtgame,3byvyy,deadstump,3,Fri Jul 3 16:10:04 2015 UTC,It would also be important to be able to edit the notes at speed.  When drivers run a stage for the first time you will often hear the driver calling out corrections as they go so that the notes are better for the next run.

I did! Those things are rockets, and there wasn't nearly as much understeer as I expected. The wheelspin was probably exaggerating it, but the speedo kept telling me I was doing 100+ MPH.  It's a little unrelated, but if there was a way to turn off motion blur ingame—without sacrificing any of the other visual bells and whistles—be it in the options menu or through a .ini edit—I'd be appreciative.

Mod support is one of those things that would take this game to the next level. Even if it is just support for user made tracks and liveries, I think it could really be a game changer.  Also, I'd love to be able to drive all of the rally cars at Pikes Peak.

dirtgame,3c0mb0,Jastley,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:17:42 2015 UTC,"Moving on from the mini cooper to a RWD car, it seems that i cannot really just throw it around corners, and really have to control my throttle. is there any other tips that can improve my driving"
dirtgame,3c0mb0,Wrongsaveimporter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"First thing I noticed was your late gear changing. You should try to shift down earlier to the gear you want to accelerate from when you are exiting the corner, that way you will keep the revs up.  In RWD throwing the car around with strong wheel turns and applying some throttle should be enough to get you through most corners (at the same time you will have to countersteer gradually depending on how strong you are pressing the throttle), on some haripins and acute turns you could just touch the e-brake to throw the back of the car more, if you are experiencing understeer (due to braking for example).   You should keep in mind that you steer using the throttle, when you are turning applying more throttle will cause the car to oversteer and most likely spin, lifting off the throttle will cause it to straighten up. You will quickly find that in :old"" RWDs it's a matter of balance between throttling and countersttering  With that in mind, your run was quite decent. My biggest time gain came unfortunately from replaying the tracks, until I learned how to drive RWD on satisfying level; and you will be most likely affected by that as well. Only after 30+ h I can now win a stage against the AI in first run, and mind you - only about 25% stages."
dirtgame,3c0mb0,Case_f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yeh, I haven't really done much simdriving never mind rally. ~15 hours, so I'm not sure when to change gears, when to brake etc.  Also I started with the mini cooper, which is fwd, so I learning rwd is a change haha.  Thank you"
dirtgame,3c0mb0,Case_f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm probably not the one to talk too much, but one thing I notice in your video quite a lot is that you should work on your cornering skills. You're driving the car way too much like a road car, which means you start to turn your wheel quite late into the corner, making you run too wide on the exit. When also combined with late braking and the resulting understeer from stepping on the brakes in hope of stopping the car from going off the road, it's a recipe for disaster.  Learn to use inertia and the weight of the car to your advantage to help you get around corners. Which basically means learn to use a Scandinavian flick, but, most importantly, understand how and why it works. Once you do understand that, your technique will improve overall. You should flick the car around corners more, not steer it through them - you have to go significantly slower through a corner if you want to steer the car through it (at least when we're talking gravel and similar low grip stuff - on tarmac, it gets a bit more complicated). The catch, though, is of course not overdoing it ;)  Also, as I mentioned the late braking, do keep in mind that it's generally both faster and safer to brake earlier and then accelerate out of the corner, than it is to brake late and then lose time and your line trying to recover from it. Especially in low grip scenarios. You should really be done with pretty much any braking before you even enter the corner - mid-corner, you only use the brakes to assist you in weight transfer when needed, not really to slow down your car."
dirtgame,3c0mb0,mmm1kko,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"ok, yeh I've probably gotten use to racing on a track with f1 cars or road cars, so i brake pretty late.   I do agree with you that my cornering sucks, and also I wasn't sure when to change gears( before the corner or exiting it) so I will try to improve those aspects.   Thanks for the advice"
dirtgame,3c0mb0,capnbard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"With gear changes, I'd say it's the same as with the braking - you generally want to get down to the gear you'll be taking the corner in before the corner, keep the gear the same through the corner and then accelerate away on exit. No mid-corner gear changes (or very rarely), as that might upset the car and cost you more than downshifting a bit too early would.  When downshifting before the corner, it's good to bear in mind that you generally want to keep your revs higher for the engine to have more power and for you to be able to control the slide better by throttle control.  You don't want to let your revs drop too low, especially with turbocharged cars, as that will cost you both time and car control.  But then again, I'm certainly not the fastest one around, so take my advice for what it is."
dirtgame,3c0mb0,mmm1kko,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Use the lateral edge of your tires to brake during sliding, don't just brake in straight line. Say in Scandi flick turn to the left you might help the rear loosen when you first flick a bit to right with a tap of brake, and after that when you flick to the right you adjust the cornering radius by throttle and left foot braking."

dirtgame,3bzjeu,CavCavTHESatNav,3,Fri Jul 3 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"Correct, junctions mainly especially where the actul track isn't that obvious -i.e. it might be hidden or blind - the yellow ones that you sometimes see are a warning before the red ones. They are also used to signify what the road does at blind crests. So something that may look like a flat out section but has a steep drop after a crest may have a red arrow on either side just pointing vertically up to denote this, if the road curves after the crest then the arrow will be pointing up and to the right or left a bit. If memory serves there is one like that coming out of the bowl in Sweet Lamb on Wales where it's a jump and the roads turns to the right after. There are a lot in Germany because it's purposefully a maze of junctions and mis-direction:)"

dirtgame,3bzdzx,PkMaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:02:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only person with this, no idea what's causing it but it seems to be primarily happening with accelerating hard"
dirtgame,3bzdzx,Hobbnob,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:50:48 2015 UTC,Haha yeah. I was worried that the switches were failing in the shifter. It seems to only happen in dirt. I haven't had an issue with it in simraceway or Assetto Corsa.
dirtgame,3bzdzx,PkMaster,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:47:58 2015 UTC,I think it happens when you shift too fast. I found that it pops back into neutral sometimes if you let of the clutch too fast.
dirtgame,3bzdzx,ImpulseGundam,3,Sun Jul 5 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"I do, and I found that I missed shifts a lot (to the point where I flipped the table and just went with auto-clutch for a while). My problem turned out to be that I would have a single smooth motion for shifting, which meant I was pulling the gear lever out of gear as I hit the clutch pedal, put it back into gear as the clutch pedal went fully down. It seems the bite point on the clutch is fairly deep, so pulling the gear lever out while only slightly having started to press the clutch is simply too 'sloppy' of a shift.  If you're often missing shifts when you feel in the groove and in high stress braking zones (i.e. where your motions are quickest), try paying attention to whether you're maybe being too sloppy in your shifts and you're technically already taking the car out of gear with the clutch pedal not even halfway down yet."

dirtgame,3bzdzx,aggresivenapk1n,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:04:16 2015 UTC,Small tip calibrate your clutch about 2/3 of the way down and you will not miss many shifts because of engagement point. Clutches can be adjusted like that IRL so its not cheating per say
dirtgame,3bzdzx,Annoying_Arsehole,3,Fri Jul 3 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"It is the only way to use it currently :( I wish there was sequential + clutch and then I'd use the easy sequential mod for modern cars.  The clutch is so important for tight corners, you can keep your revs properly up while turning in and then get the rear out at the right time by dumping the clutch.  I'm currently trying to figure out a way to mod a bite point to the clutch so I know when its depressed enough. Also need a load cell brake mod too and perhaps a bit heavier spring for the gas pedal.  In all fairness the smart move for every driver would be to buy fanatecs with load cells, it is probably the best improvement one can buy, sadly I find them too expensive given that I bought my g27 little used for 140EUR."

I moved the biting point of the clutch set to when the pedal is about 1/3 compressed, and it feels so much better! Not only do I never miss a gear but I can also shift much faster. It's really simple to do - when you're calibrating your wheel in-game and it tells you to compress your pedals completely, just compress your clutch pedal to where you want the biting point to be and press any button."

dirtgame,3bvojt,mess8,21,Thu Jul 2 15:09:45 2015 UTC,Pace note editor would be a really useful tool. And also the ability to record your own pacenotes in the language of your choosing.   It's a simulator and i don't think that it would be too much to ask from a sim to be able to edit your pacenotes. They are very personal and i think some of us could shave of a couple of seconds if we could have the notes we really wanted.
dirtgame,3bvojt,najtrows,15,Thu Jul 2 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, the pacenotes can be either inconsistent in how they rate a corner, but more importantly IMO they can be inconsistent in how early they're called. I've found a significant part of very low speed corners are called way too late when you're coming up to them at high speed. I've had the guy call a 'turn left 1' while I was already halfway done with it, with the pacenote setting to 'normal' timing. I've had to set it to Earlier to deal with those failing slow corners, but then the stuff that was perfect on Normal is called so crazy early that it gets almost confusing because I'm focusing on the corner ahead when he's already 4 down the road.  I would definitely want an editor where I could potentially re-rate corners but at the very least adjust the point where it gets called out."
dirtgame,3bvojt,GTOfire,3,Thu Jul 2 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, I was doing some Monte today and there's one stage which has a sequence that goes (more less):  Left 4 into right 3 into immediate hairpin left  Left 4 gets called out rather late already, right 3 when I'm halfway through it and then 'immediate hairpin left' translates to just '**** me... BOINK' And that's on early call outs.  Another game already has a pace notes mod with its worn editor and you can set at what point which command is given, we could do with something like this too..."
dirtgame,3bvojt,Lari-Fari,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"Is this going down? Following the immediate hairpin left is 5 right, a straight over a bridge, 4 or 3 right (past a van) then 3 right? Then I think I know which part you mean :)"
dirtgame,3bvojt,shark6428,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Even if the turn gets called right, it's gotta be timed correctly and completely.

dirtgame,3bvojt,Talpaman,5,Fri Jul 3 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"pace notes are messed up, in like 70% of the tracks imho. there always is that really fast corner called as a hard 2, or a sharp left turn after a high jump called a fast 6.  i play in italian, and a lot of times the co-driver goes mute for a corner... and in most of the new german tracks the voice is completely different, as if they forgot to add the microphone filter."

dirtgame,3bvojt,vmaxmuffin,5,Fri Jul 3 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"Aside from a pacenote edditor, I had an idea of creating a post here on reddit where people could submit proposed changes to pace notes (in the format of car driven for context, stage name, rough ""area"" on stage where the corner is, video of corner or gif with written explanation of the current pace note, and an explanation of the change you'd like to make). People could up/downvote changes they agree or disagree with."
dirtgame,3bvojt,SkitTrick,11,Fri Jul 3 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"Greece is one of the main culprits of underrated turns in the pacenotes: like this insanely misjudged last corner that says '4"" and it's actually a solid 2, at least in my book; there's also a 1 turn that's basically an acute left and a 2 turn that's a 3 long, because I'm sure it's impossible to ride out a 2 at the limiter in 3rd gear in that Fiesta RS without spitting your teeth out when you eat the tree on the outside. I think Codies revised a handful of turns in the Hillclimb update, but would you really ask them to go over everything and change the notes? If I were in their shoes that wouldn't be a nice proposition, and they have a schedule and content to release. An editor or an editable file in the game could do it better in my opinion, although I know nothing about how it would clash with the audio.  I not only have an issue with the pacenotes being inconsistent but also with the fact that the default way of getting better at this game is to play it like a circuit racing sim and just run it again and again until you know the breaking points and what gear you're in at every turn, and that's not the rally way. The game rewards more those who know the stages by heart, and that's not the developers fault, there's only so many stages they can create, and creating them is expensive (as it's been broadly documented), but at some point doesn't the co-driver become irrelevant? If the idea of the daily is that you have one shot to do your best in one stage, why can I practice it four hours and nail it in the first try? Why not have it be a gamble between stupid bravery and cautious cunning? Jeremy Clarkson way vs James May way? I don't know, I think the stages that go into the daily shouldn't be available for custom events for the 24 hours that they are in the daily. At least until mod support brings forth a sea of fan made stages, which I think is the only plausible way to keep it genuine.  Sorry for the wall of text."
dirtgame,3bvojt,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jul 2 20:40:16 2015 UTC,Agree about the pace notes. They could use us and edit them according to collected feedback. Or yeah... Just give us an editor ... :)  About the daily... Never even thought about that. The payout if you master it by practising for hours isn't really worth the effort I think. But what about not showing what the stages will be until you've started them. Then people can't practise. :)  EDIT: Oh dear... Sorry abuut the multipost spam. Was on a train yesterday and had a bad connection. Might have been the reason. I deleted them now...

dirtgame,3bvojt,Zheiko,3,Sat Jul 4 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"I agree... pace notes are sometimes off. Sometimes, it would be great if there was bigger voice intonation from the codriver, like warning for extremely sharp turns behind crest.

dirtgame,3bvojt,A1rHorn,3,Fri Jul 3 10:21:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely struggle with it. When you're trying to drive a 037 or a Peugeot 205 and you have pacenotes designed for a mini cooper it can get a bit tedious. Like GTOfire said, how early the notes are called is wildly varied. Some corners aren't even called (like the left 4 at the end of Pant Mawr)."
dirtgame,3bvojt,RedHairNoCares,3,Thu Jul 2 23:48:20 2015 UTC,I've no confidence in the pace notes either. I have to learn the stages which isn't a big deal but you're right it's not the rally way.
dirtgame,3bvojt,Jackigg,2,Fri Jul 3 03:30:18 2015 UTC,Sometimes 5 is 4 and 3 is 2 and so on.
dirtgame,3bvojt,Annoying_Arsehole,2,Thu Jul 2 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"Well that also depends how you line up to the corner, but yeah there are some clear mistaken classifications."
dirtgame,3bvojt,iktnl,2,Thu Jul 2 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like the pace notes do start early enough, but the codriver talks too slowly. Take the 60s Mini for example, a stage of Greece is pretty okay and doable. But when you're in a Group B car or better, the important words are spoken too late. Sure you hear ""left"", but the ""3 tightens"" comes too late, at which point you're driving by what you see instead of what you here. Hearing the word ""tightens"" while you're already halfway is just way too late to fix your speed and direction."
dirtgame,3bvojt,GTOfire,2,Fri Jul 3 10:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's a stage in germany where you're coming in at high speed and he says 'caution, left 5 into right 2'. And if I'm not already on the brakes by the 'caution' I slam into the spectators basically. And that's fair enough, that's why he starts with caution. But then some other tracks he says 'caution braking into hairpin left', and there's still plenty of time. It needs to be consistent so that caution either means you brake immediately as you wait for him to call what the caution is about, or you have enough time to hear about it and then brake."
dirtgame,3bvojt,GTOfire,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:42:02 2015 UTC,"Actually what could also help, despite not being the most realistic: visual pace notes on the track, same as how RBR can show them. It saves so much confusion knowing where exactly that 3 right over long crest actually is, and you can usually see 2-3 corners ahead even when the co-driver hasn't had a chance to finish his callout yet."
dirtgame,3bvojt,EyePad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:07:39 2015 UTC,Wow great idea. The ability to edit pace notes would be awesome.
dirtgame,3bvojt,slokenafk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:31:54 2015 UTC,I havent had too much issue with pacenotes being innacurate. I have had some issues where their audio cuts out after tapping into an object or something. Late calls can be annoying too. I forget where exactly but its like a 200m straight with a sharp turn and he calls it late and it kills me every time.  A pacenote editor would be fantastic. Overall I cant really complain about the pacenotes. At this point on my favorite tracks (wales) I know them well enough to expect some things.
dirtgame,3bvojt,Ramrodicus,2,Thu Jul 2 16:20:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah there was a spot in one of the new German stages where you're hauling ass on a long straightaway with crests and dips that goes into a square left with those tombstone things on the inside and outside. I think they underestimated just how much ass we'd be hauling into that corner. You can't see it until you come up over a crest, and you need to brake pretty much as soon as you come over that crest, but the call doesn't come until you're already well into the braking zone."
dirtgame,3bvojt,SiddTheVicious,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"I had no problems with the pacenotes until i got a group B car. Once I started moving at a faster pace I encountered all kinds of problems. Also by switching the setting to 'Early' it is too early for me and i'm hearing 3 or 4 corners in advance. The normal setting is so close to perfect.   As of now, as soon as i get the call I have to downshift and or hit the brakes immediately."
dirtgame,3bz2i8,raphyr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:51:14 2015 UTC,"First video entry on this subreddit! Figured I'd give this run a shot since it had some really nice cornerwork for my doing.

I'd just pull it for handbrake and as I removed my hand I'd nudge it back into neutral position. And if that sounds inconvenient or error-prone, it really wasn't. I had expected it to be kinda weird, but it was fine really.

The new G29 shifter is even worse, not only that it doesnt have the switch, it also has no buttons:D (all moved to the steering wheel)  Edit: To clarify, why I think that having buttons on shifter is better, is because I can keep rolling with steering wheel like crazy and still reach handbrake button with other hand - while, especially with Dirt, trying to handbrake into hairpin, when you need to turn steering wheel at least 700degrees, is impossible."

""My RWD car oversteers at the slightest bump or around turns during acceleration!: Lower the rear differential driving lock percentage, weaken rear ARB and strengthen front ARB, increase negative rear camber angle (don’t exceed -1.0o ), lower rear Toe Angle (try +0.2o or +0.1o ), try stiffening front bump and rebound, and softening rear bump and rebound (don’t go to extremes).""  Also, get in the habit of using very little throttle on corners in RWD, like 20-50% throttle until you are near straight.  A little goes a long way in this case."

dirtgame,3bs19l,Lryder2k6,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:15:12 2015 UTC,I found that simply making the rear 1 click softer in the general settings went a long way to making the car much more drive able and much faster due to increased traction.
dirtgame,3bqxnu,vmaxmuffin,3,Wed Jul 1 12:54:03 2015 UTC,"Clutch for sequential is a major gripe for me, there's no reason for it not to be an option (why isn't the clutch pedal active all the time, why so we have to select a transmission mode with the clutch enabled?).   Atm I can't drop the clutch to kick the rear out for a drift, and the handbrake is a bit too eager for me (only have a button for it)"
dirtgame,3bqxnu,_LV426,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:25:14 2015 UTC,I would also like to change the shifting so that you can't shift while full throttle as I think you usually have to come off the gas to change gear with a sequential.
dirtgame,3bqxnu,gussy1z,2,Wed Jul 1 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"Very much this. I want to use H-Shifters for cars that have them, and sequential for cars that have that instead. I don't want to research each car to see which setup it uses IRL and then switch my entire controller profile in one section of the menus, then go into the controls in another section to rebind stuff around.  I would also love for the button legend to not tell me to press e.g. button 16. For a controller a button-mapped legend makes sense, press A for this, X for that. For a G27, I have no idea which button is 16, which is 19, etc. I've figured out that my paddles are 5 and 6, but my h-shifter is in a box somewhere and I use a fanatec one instead. So when the game asks me to press button 16, 17, or 18, not only would I not even know WHICH button on the shifter that is supposed to be, I couldn't press it if I did."
dirtgame,3bqxnu,GTOfire,2,Wed Jul 1 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"Just by the way, try the F-keys on the keyboard for those button functions (I assume you mean for changing weather, liveries and stuff like that)"
dirtgame,3bqxnu,GTOfire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:28:33 2015 UTC,"yeah 5 and 6 are the paddles, 17 is F1, 18 is enter and 19 is ESC. I haven't found 16 yet, it didn't appear to be F2 or anything nearby. I haven't literally pressed every button on the keyboard to find it, since I mostly thought 'fuck it, it's early access, Im sure they'll fix it at some point'.

My entire RBR experience was a lie! I remember that game only giving me the option for shift up and down, so I used paddle-shifting and used my shifter as a handbrake. Now that I have an actual sequential shifter I might stick with the paddle as a handbrake (like I do for h-shifter cars) and the shifter as a shifter though."

My fanatec analog handbrake eventually gets to a point where I can't reach the max without trying to yank the thing apart almost, a saturation like the other analog axis setting would easily resolve this.

dirtgame,3brlg8,cuntalist,8,Wed Jul 1 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"Driver: 100/0/0/0 + your preferred degrees (i use 540 with no soft lock, if you want to use soft lock use 900)  In-Game: 100/0/90/90/0/0/100 (last one is soft lock so it doesn't matter if you don't use it)  Remember to calibrate your wheel in-game after you have made adjustments to drivers!!  So basically wheel friction does nothing when dampening is off so its 0, tyre slip acts weird with G27 so its 0, collision seems kinda pointless so its 0.

dirtgame,3brkje,Annoying_Arsehole,5,Wed Jul 1 16:05:34 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/kExke7uViZg?t=30s  If you compare game to this video many of those accelerations from hairpins don't look that far off.
dirtgame,3brkje,kakkela,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, however they're driving it safe, no resets etc. Notice how they don't event attempt to slide and go with low power, they could if they wanted to but its too risky in a long rally."
dirtgame,3brkje,mmm1kko,2,Wed Jul 1 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Well you really shouldn't hammer it, even in-game where you can reset. It's faster to go just on the edge.  Imho 037 can launch with a lot of wheelspin in-game if you really try to do it."
dirtgame,3brkje,kakkela,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:11:19 2015 UTC,Are those people really stupid? Standing 2 inches away from the road after a hairpin.
dirtgame,3brkje,Razon,6,Wed Jul 1 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"That was the spectator culture back then, and still is in some countries. Mexico comes to mind first, those Baja spectators sometimes even try to touch cars passing by."
dirtgame,3brkje,kakkela,3,Wed Jul 1 18:28:08 2015 UTC,Madness. If I was the driver I'd be pissed if they were standing in my way like that. Wouldn't be just a +15 sec penalty there :p
dirtgame,3brkje,Razon,3,Wed Jul 1 18:43:25 2015 UTC,Sometimes I want to step out of my rally car and punch some spectators in the face because I clearly did not hit them but I still got a 15 second penalty. Same goes for that asshat who parks his car at the end of a fast and blind bend on one of the Monaco stages.
dirtgame,3brkje,mazdarati2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:16:27 2015 UTC,Standing like that at a hairpin is a lot safer than on just about any other corner.  Reason being the car is going to slowest and you can get out of the way.  You will notice that even then people didn't really stand very close on the outside of the run out of the hairpin turns (where you would go if you had no brakes or overshot a bit).
dirtgame,3brkje,deadstump,2,Wed Jul 1 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah you may be right. What what about when someone understeers, he has to wait for the crowd to go away or back up a little and adjust."

dirtgame,3brkje,shunen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that gravel perhaps has somewhat too much but in the end you can easily adjust your diff settings on gravel for suitable cornering while sliding, if there is less grip in the future then I'll just loosen the the diff and I'll end up with same type cornering as now."
dirtgame,3brkje,Jackigg,2,Wed Jul 1 17:18:25 2015 UTC,Are you have tried real rally car grip on tarmac?
dirtgame,3brkje,mmm1kko,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"My personal experience about sports cars are porcshes and bmw's, both RWD, though with normal road tires. Both were around 300hp so quite low powered compared to grpB cars and with normal tires you had no problem initiating slides whenever you wanted.   Now I expect the rally cars have period correct tires under them (the development of better rubber has been insane) and while they might be somewhat grippier that extra power should compensate. Or perhaps codies should give us an option to have period correct and modern rubber under us."
dirtgame,3brkje,TitlersFinalSolution,3,Wed Jul 1 17:00:15 2015 UTC,That is what you can do in Asseto Corsa and I think it would be a cool thing to have.
dirtgame,3brkje,JacksGT,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do agree 100%.  Tight, 90° corner, second gear, Group B RWD. You can hit the accelerator full on and the wheels won't even squeak, UNLESS you touch the grass, then you do need to be careful.  Nevertheless, in a 500+HP RWD car you should always have to be careful (which is not the case)."

dirtgame,3bnj28,sound-fx,5,Tue Jun 30 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Great! Glad to know, you guys deserve big thanks. You had me sold when you modeled intake/exhaust sounds separately, let alone the rest of the details."
dirtgame,3bnj28,jay_p_666,3,Tue Jun 30 18:53:42 2015 UTC,"I've said it further down, but just to make sure you don't miss it...nailing the sound of tyre friction against the surfaces wether it's when braking or sliding is crucial, as it would really help giving us a constant feedback of the situation of our tyres grip level so we can make proper steering adjustment accordingly. For what's already in, those are top notch sounds, really! Thanks guys for your hard work!!"
dirtgame,3bnj28,axxor-,2,Tue Jun 30 20:00:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely a fan of the work you guys are doing. I know you guys have already heard about some cars (Delta S4, Impreza) being unable to source and having to use different sounds, but even then the sounds for those cars are still top notch. I really appreciate the effort that's gone into the sound on the whole."
dirtgame,3bnj28,A1rHorn,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you did great work with the 037. It's legitimately worrying when you hit a crest and you hear the whole car creak. It adds a new dimension to the game"
dirtgame,3bnj28,mmm1kko,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say add some options for more low freqs, butt kickers etc. use them so they don't work well currently. Overall I think your audio side is awesome compared to most of the competition though so no big complaints, just the low end is missing, which isn't all engine noise, but also body vibrations etc. impossible to capture from stationary cars and all that."
dirtgame,3bnj28,Ballistica,3,Tue Jun 30 19:38:42 2015 UTC,Could use SimVibe to better use a transducer?
dirtgame,3bnj28,QuitoPR,13,Tue Jun 30 22:59:09 2015 UTC,The audio is definitely top notch. It makes for an insanely immersive driving experience. Now if only they added a little bit of low end to the engine rumble so it can put my subwoofer to work.
dirtgame,3bnj28,jay_p_666,7,Tue Jun 30 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably the best audio I've heard in any racing game to date! If I had one suggestion to make, it would be to be able to hear the exhaust pop sound from the cockpit, and most of all, not only having that ambiant sound of pebbles hitting interior of the wheel wings, but also having the sound of tyre friction against the surfaces, wether it's when braking or sliding, as it would really help giving us a constant feedback of the situation of our tyres grip level so we can make proper steering adjustment accordingly."
dirtgame,3bnj28,deadstump,5,Tue Jun 30 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, most, if not all of those effects are already in, they're just not overpowering as is the case in most titles. A few mixing options would be nice in the audio menu, because other than that, I actually like the approach they've taken. It sounds much more realistic than ""feedback-rich"". Mixing options would just give you some extra room."
dirtgame,3bnj28,Justin_Andrews,11,Tue Jun 30 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, most of the exhaust pops and whatnot are not super loud in the car since they happen behind you for the most part and are literally directed away from you and you are driving away from them."
dirtgame,3bnj28,hvyboots,3,Tue Jun 30 18:29:14 2015 UTC,Ditto.

I don't think there was any real timeframe given, neither did they promise such option is 100 % coming (but Paul Coleman said something like that ""he's certainly not against the idea"")."

dirtgame,3bn6bz,Procrastinator_5000,3,Tue Jun 30 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"I think rather you should hope for a Dakar game using the engine they develop here at some later date. At best, maybe they will do an African stage, but from the sound of it—six countries, 40 cars—according to what I heard in the live launch for Germany they are focused very narrowly on recreating actual rally stages at this point. And to be honest, I have absolutely no problem with that either."

dirtgame,3blwf6,Wrongsaveimporter,2,Tue Jun 30 08:03:25 2015 UTC,"I like it how you can really feel how the difference between fwd and rwd in hairpins, need some practice with hairpins though."
dirtgame,3blwf6,Emperalhero,2,Tue Jun 30 08:46:44 2015 UTC,"I could really use more practice with RWD in hairpins.  On FWD if you are entering too fast, you can just hold down the gas and tap or hold the handbrake until you are facing the direction you want to go without losing too much speed."
dirtgame,3blpfh,Wrongsaveimporter,4,Tue Jun 30 06:06:44 2015 UTC,"You are braking very early.  You should push your braking points further into the corners and brake very aggressively rather than kind of doing a long slow braking.  As you are reaching the part where you will actually want to start turning you will gradually back off the brake (known as trail braking), and if you are using your left foot (LFB) you might never fully lift off the brake as you go through the corner.  Once you are down to your cornering speed you will want to go through the corner with your foot somewhere in the middle of your gas pedal, so you will want to be in the correct gear for whatever speed that is.  Then you can use a combination of throttle and brake to control the car's attitude through the turn.  I personally like to LFB while still on the throttle a little to tighten the turn (I feel like it helps to control wheel spin while still tucking in well), but others prefer all right foot.    On the exit, you will want to roll into the power and maintain traction to push yourself out of the corner.  If you give it the boot too early and/or too hard you will induce a lot of oversteer and loop the car.  It takes practice.  Let me know if you have any specific questions about what I said."
dirtgame,3blpfh,deadstump,2,Tue Jun 30 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the tips and thorough explanation. Now I have to eradicate my bad habits (I taught myself to brake early to downshift gears earlier in order to be on the apex with the correct gear - it takes me some time using sequencer to downshift 2 or 3 gears). I immediately managed to reduce my time to 2:57 on this stage, so now I'm going to put those tips in use running ""fresh"" stages, as in a real rally. Thanks again ;)"
dirtgame,3blpfh,dgeesio,2,Tue Jun 30 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"Hi, as you can see I'm still struggling. Aside form catching the grass on few occasions I really don't know how to properly drive on tarmac.   It seems that even when loosening the rear differential I spin, when I'm using the e-brake and applying some throttle - the car either spins into a corner, or if I manage to countersteer, the car will suddenly regain grip and shoot straight out of the corner in the direction the wheels are pointing during countersteering. I manage to correct my course sometimes with very brief application of the handbrake, but if I press it for longer periods I will stall, or spin, if I add throttle to the mix. I don't have advanced setup unlocked yet for this BMW.  Any tips on how to properly take corners in a fast manner? I feel like I'm loosing time trying to slide, and I would be slightly faster just using more technical race driving."

This was one of the causes of the dreaded error 41.    Achievement – “Going up in the world” will now pop if you had previously purchased a Hillclimb car but not received the achievement.    Stability – Driving the Peugeot 405 T16 would sometimes cause stability issues, we’ve fixed those now.    Graphics – Quite a few changes for users running Nvidia SLI. That weird black and orange screen bug is fixed and we’ve solved the graphical corruption when using SLI and anti-aliasing on high/ultra graphical presets.    Audio – The engine audio level in cockpit view can now be properly controlled by the slider.    Gameplay – The reset button should appear sooner during those awkward moments when you beach your car at the side of the road. Though we advise not beaching your car.    Gameplay – Sometimes you could rev the engine so hard on the Audi Sport Quattro the “Recover vehicle” prompt would pop up, it won’t do that anymore.    Gameplay – We’ve planted some trees and shrubs in areas of Greece and Wales where we spotted that some of you were taking shortcuts. Taking some cuts in rally is cool but these cuts were definitely not cool.    Gameplay – Fixed a loophole which would let you continually repair your car in Online Hillclimb events.    Gameplay – Online Hillclimb events will now factor in slower times from Run 2 and they won’t overwrite faster times from Run 1.    Message box – Stopped the Promotion message box from incorrectly displaying when you have completed the Masters Championship and finished in the top 3 positions.    Save – Your advanced set ups should now save as expected    Oculus – Sometimes the background on the main menu would vanish, we’ve fixed that now.   Online Events – You’ll now be disqualified if you don’t start moving within a minute    Leagues – Made the text on the league screens easier to read on lower resolutions.    Audio – Pre-update your co-driver may have become a little disinterested if you left the centre of the track from time to time, we’ve spoken to him about his attitude.    Audio – Ever had two sets of music play over a replay? That’s not a remix version and it should stop happening from now on.    Controller Fix – Fixed an issue which meant players couldn’t change the stage conditions when using the Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel."

dirtgame,3bi8sy,Macio999,16,Mon Jun 29 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"I have to say I'm kinda disappointed by the update... both stages are kinda similar and doesn't do justice to how beautiful and unique Rally Germany really is IMHO. I know they've been accurately designed according to their real life counterparts... something very welcome, but you selected pretty boring, flat and wide ones.  Rally Deutschland as a whole is about lots of twitchy sections in vineyards, fast parts on highways, more elevation changes, etc. If I was to plan a flying trip to Germany, I would have more carefully selected the stages which are really worth to recreate, especially when you are limited to only 2 unique stages per country. Why someone would not want a beautiful scenery like this to be part of his game is beyond me:   http://www.volkswagen-motorsport.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Fans_Friends/1%20WRC/Rallye/Deutschland/Rallye_Guide/2013/Highlights/Moselland/886x498px_vw-20130823-5185.jpg  http://www.volkswagen-motorsport.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Fans_Friends/1%20WRC/Rallye/Deutschland/Rallye_Guide/2012/Intro/95364_Gassnerjnr08D12d165.jpg"
dirtgame,3bi8sy,jay_p_666,5,Mon Jun 29 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"I also felt the same, I was expecting something... different. Seems very flat and wide as you said."
dirtgame,3bi8sy,marts30,2,Mon Jun 29 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that Baumholder is a military training site, and that stages like Panzerplatte, literally translated means ""Tank Road"". So you have to figure these are purely utility roads for moving large scale military machinery on. So by their very intended purpose, they will be wide, flat, and generally devoid of any significant terrain. I have no doubt that they will put the Vineyard Hills stages into the game at some point. It would be stupid not to."
dirtgame,3bi8sy,Buck-O,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:11:47 2015 UTC,I have no doubt that they will put the Vineyard Hills stages into the game at some point.   Have the devs said anywhere that they've been planning to add more tracks to the regions that have already been added? Because I haven't seen any mention of that anywhere and I'm not going to hold my hopes high.
dirtgame,3bi8sy,Cz_StRider,2,Wed Jul 1 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"I believe they have said as much on several occasions. That they want to get country environments into the game, and work on filling out the stages and alternate environments as they move on.  It would be stupid not to. Because, effectively, we only have ONE world rally stage per country now, that is chopped and chewed and reversed to get more content out of. In its full length, its still just one WRC stage, and that desperately needs to be fixed."
dirtgame,3bi8sy,Buck-O,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"well, there are diffrent parts of the german rally a big part of that is what you've shown on the pictures the winehills and the lots of hairpins, but then again you also have those parts that are more flat and more technical .... see : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCYSiLhaDk8 and i felt it looks quite similar to some of the german roads  (i'm from germany btw and i have also visited ADAC Rally Germany 2 times over the last years.)"

dirtgame,3bi8sy,Synthlover,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:35:50 2015 UTC,looks like it was related to free space on the c:\ drive. How much free space do you have after the update?
dirtgame,3bi8sy,i_dont_wash_my_hands,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:46:05 2015 UTC,I have 291 GB free space. Odd who disc size can be causing the glitch?

Abandoning the current rally and starting the next one temporarily fixes it, but it always comes back, and I have to eat a 16th place. Upgrading cars is out of the question, thankfully I had enough time to upgrade one per group. I guess I'm screwed with the new ones though. This issue came up after the hillclimb patch."

dirtgame,3bkozt,capnbard,3,Tue Jun 30 00:32:17 2015 UTC,"Late corner and/or trail breaking. Let the weight transfer to the front wheels which then compresses the front suspension to push down on the pavement, which causes the tires to have more grip.  Scandinavian Flick. If you want to slide, shave off speed until you have control, turn opposite the corner's direction and flick back towards the inside apex to initiate a scandinavian flick and push power to rear wheels to keep the car pointed your preferred direction."
dirtgame,3bkozt,3lfk1ng,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:55:30 2015 UTC,"I let off the gass, maybe break too. Throwing the weight forward and steering early. For the tighter stuff i grab the handbrake for a second or 2 while steering."

dirtgame,3bjy46,WillMase,5,Mon Jun 29 20:55:24 2015 UTC,A lot of the competitiveness was born out of the unreliability of the early AWD cars.  The RWD cars did well in the safari and all tarmac rallies where grip wasn't at such a premium.
dirtgame,3bjy46,deadstump,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"The championship I linked was the 3rd year of Group B, it's not like it was the first year of AWD, and anyway the Quattro won the championship in its first entry into the sport. You can't win a championship without having reliability so that doesn't wash with me I'm afraid.   Yes of course they performed better on tarmac/grippy surfaces. Have you tried driving the 037 on the 98% tarmac monte carlo stages and in Germany, yes it's a lot easier to drive, as you would expect but it still doesn't compete with the 4WD. If as you say they are much better on tarmac then surely their times should be up there with the 4WD cars but they're just not. Watch the video I linked in a comment on here. A current rally driver who drove a 207 at the time (2012) said that the 037 was nimbler and more precise at high speeds than his modern 207 car which has restrictions on horsepower and is all about suspension/traction/steering (as is the way with modern rally cars) whereas the 037 was in Group B which we all know meant insane horsepower and insane cars.   Yeah I really love this game but I think they've got it completely wrong with the Group B RWD cars."
dirtgame,3bjy46,deadstump,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a chance to play the game yet (shit internet), so I don't know how they stack in game.    I wasn't referring to reliability over all, but rather rally to rally.  When the AWD showed up it really blew everyone away... the RWD cars could not compete.  When the RWD did win or were competitive was when the AWD cars shit the bed and/or they had  a tarmac event with good grip the didn't overly favor the AWD cars.    In short the RWD group B cars were not effective against the AWD cars, and that is why the whole sport moved to AWD.  The 037 was the last gasp of RWD trying to hang with the AWD cars."
dirtgame,3bjy46,Crushker,2,Mon Jun 29 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"I suggest you try them then :P from the 84 championship there are 3  championships where the Lancia was in the podium spots alongside the Quattro, 2 of those were on gravel. In the Greece Rally, which we are familiar with the Lancia came within 15 seconds of 1st place and 12 seconds of 2nd place. Over 10 minutes, that is damn impressive for a RWD vs the Quattro on gravel. I would love to see someone come within that margin on this game. (I bet the can't)   Obviously scale up the gap accordingly, e.g. if it took you 20 minutes in total for the rally then within a gap of 30 seconds etc."
dirtgame,3bjy46,deadstump,2,Mon Jun 29 22:37:41 2015 UTC,If you really want to point out the competitiveness of the 037 look at the 1000 lakes rally 85. Audi brought the new E2 (which should be in this game) and Peugeot brought its Evolution 205 and Alen still led the first few stages while finishing 3rd.
dirtgame,3bjy46,i_dont_wash_my_hands,2,Mon Jun 29 22:58:56 2015 UTC,More fuel for my fire :)
dirtgame,3bjy46,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"So this got me to thinking and I went back over the results.  The RWD cars really were absent from the podium for the most part (except the safari rally and that other African event... the Japanese cars kicked everyone's asses).  But where they did appear on the podium the event tended to be a sealed surface and/or very fast where traction was less of an issue.  Now why in the game the RWD cars are not about as fast as the AWD in Germany and dry sections of Monte I don't know, but I would say that 85 was certainly showing the extent of RWD's effectiveness and triggering the end of RWD in the top level of rally."

dirtgame,3bjy46,Lunco,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"Sure but I'm driving around getting +23 and finishing top 10 in the world in the 037 which you'd think everyone would be rushing to use. The 4WD cars are way too easy to drive compared to the RWD.  I'm not bothered about being fast or slow, it's just obvious from Codemasters decisions that they think one of two things: rwd is too hard or 4wd is too easy. That's the only reason why they would separate two types of cars from the same era/competition."
dirtgame,3bkpoe,_doby_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:38:40 2015 UTC,me too... and i've been complaining about it for weeks.   Codemasters just wrote back today that they wont be fixing anything...   im tempted to return the game and get a refund.

dirtgame,3bi3ig,Liquid1me,5,Mon Jun 29 12:46:24 2015 UTC,"Since this game is an experiment for the studio, how do you like the community so far? Do we help or just make things more complicated?   So far you only released content patches, which makes me think that the player base only makes your mile-long wishlist even longer instead of being an extension to QA team and improving what's already in the game."

Thanks for Reply!"
dirtgame,3bi3ig,jay_p_666,2,Mon Jun 29 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they will be released alongside the Flying Finland pack coming in September. You can see in the description on dirtgame.com: We head to Finland for some of the fastest sections of road in rally with two legendary cars from two legendary drivers to go with it.

dirtgame,3bi3ig,middels8088,3,Mon Jun 29 16:37:14 2015 UTC,Would there be any plans for more Hill Climb tracks and cars? Having Pikes Peak and three cars alone for a whole racing discipline in the game would be pretty underwhelming IMHO.
dirtgame,3bi3ig,tobberobbe,3,Mon Jun 29 13:29:25 2015 UTC,"Are there plans to refine the AI's times? At this point, if you finish 1st on the 1st run of the event, you will maintain lead/stay in the top 3, while if you mess up, you end up mid-pack and it becomes fairly unrecoverable.  Yes I understand that it's not always possible to recover from mid-pack in real life. It's just that the stage times seems to be set based on some form of algorithm, instead of dynamically."
dirtgame,3bi3ig,deadstump,2,Mon Jun 29 12:34:54 2015 UTC,"I for one would like to see more inter AI battles.  Every now and again you will see one make a mistake and drop way down the leaderboard, but you don't see too many positions being traded back and fourth."

Do the weekly challenge with only a couple of penalties? Ten minutes slower than the no.1. Do the daily challenge that doesn't pay as much? Top tier every time.... Hmmm..."
dirtgame,3bi3ig,RuneRuler,0,Mon Jun 29 14:36:17 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there are only a few polish and a jap that has been blatantly using cheats.  Its not a big issue yet, but it will become one unless the promised measures are taken against them.  I have spoken to the likes of PorkHammer (swedish) and Ji1 (norwegian) these guys are regularly on top with rallycameraman ( british) and others.  I am absolutely confident these guys do NOT cheat, and they provide ample video content to prove they don't.  But when someone suddenly take over a minute off them on a stage, alarm bells should go off."
dirtgame,3bi3ig,deadstump,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:41 2015 UTC,Is it reasonable to request that since you already have the stages mapped out that we might get them in different seasons (where it makes sense... like Monte and Sweden/Finland (when they come))?    Will there be a damage selector?  It would be awesome to actually be forced to retire after center punching a tree at the top of fourth gear.
dirtgame,3bi3ig,Annoying_Arsehole,4,Mon Jun 29 13:22:14 2015 UTC,What do you feel are the biggest differences gameplay wise between Monte Carlo and the Tarmac Terrors stages?

Lately and more frequently, the top of the leaderboards have been populated with people that are clearly cheating. What are you guys doing about this? Is there anywhere to report these people?   Can I suggest adding a ""ghosts"" feature to the leaderboards (because that's cool and fun too)?"

dirtgame,3bk9uk,1104uk,2,Mon Jun 29 22:25:09 2015 UTC,The comment from the developers is killing my optimism for this game.... i can't believe they shipped this crap as a FFB patch :(  http://steamcommunity.com/app/310560/discussions/1/523890046866501159/
dirtgame,3bk9uk,MDK2015,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"It's not even that crap, tyre slip effect causes inverted feeling on many wheels afaik.  Try the settings I posted above and it works mostly like real world steering."

These are pre 0.5 settings, have not tested them with the update yet. I had some initial frustrations with FFB, but I love this. Much more akin to other sims I have played."
dirtgame,3bk9uk,maestro02,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"You could have probably dug out last post (less than week old) before posting another new one...   For settings, i use 100/0/0/0/540 on drivers (no soft lock) and 100/0/90/90/0/0/100 in-game (have just left softlock at 100, shouldnt matter as its off).   0 Deadzone, 100 Saturation and 0 Linearity."
dirtgame,3bk9uk,kakkela,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"Just tried it again using the setting you suggested, but it still has the same problems.  I think there is a significant delay between the simulation and the FFB output - if you travel at like 30mph, and give the wheel a little nudge, the self centering action is hugely delayed and the car spins itself out within 4 oscillations.  Granted the G25 isn't the speediest of things but it does not do this in the other games I listed.  I think there are issues deeper down in the tarmac surface physics, but I'm going to try the IMPACT mod people are suggesting - I'll report back."
dirtgame,3bk9uk,Henriquetmm,2,Wed Jul 1 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Ok the IMPACT mod over on race department is a huge improvement over what's currently in the 0.5 patch.  Here are the settings I ended up using, pulled from Dom's post, hopefully he doesn't mind:  Wheel Rotation = 900 Overall effect strength = 100% Spring effect strength = 0% Damper effect strength = 0% Center spring enabled = Yes Center spring strength = 0% Allow Game to adjust settings = Yes    And in game:  S.A.T. = 77% Wheel Friction = 45% Tyre Friction = 45% Susp = 65% Tyre Slip = 60% Collision = 100% Soft Lock = 100%   CM has a lot more work to do on the simulation models, but at least this has made the game much more enjoyable to drive :)."

Do you play on a lap top or something? Have you upgraded your video drivers in the last year? No mention of system specs, or of driver revision makes this sound like an attempt to find fault anywhere else but on your own desktop.   Chris also has some sort of solid state drive issue, where the game’s physics engine lags momentarily and makes the game completely unplayable for him.   And on what technical merit did you conclude this is an ""SSD problem""? Very reaching, very anecdotal, and very much incorrect. I have read nothing else about this, and I am currently running it off of an SSD with no problems...so...yeah, I guess my computer is full of magic and unicorn blood.  And the rest of it I cant even bother to comment on because it comes off as completely pretentious, and just bitching for bitchings sake.  Seriously, the whole post came off as sounding like youre a total twat, or a 13 year old keyboard warrior, im not sure which.

dirtgame,3biiin,SimonCharles,2,Mon Jun 29 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"My first impressions is that tarmac with rain is a completely new thing to get used to. The cars slide around like crazy at some points. Not saying that it's bad or unrealistic or anything, just completely different from what we've had so far.   I prefer gravel tracks to tarmac ones, but this one seems fun once you get used to it. I like the chicanes and how they break up the tempo.  Right now I'm having lots of ""what the hell??"" moments where I'm flying right into rocks at full speed when I'm turning the wheel and the car just keeps going straight. I'm going to chalk that up to not being familiar with the course and the new road/weather combination. Right now it feels like the most difficult rally so far, but that's too early to say only a few stages in.  The stages look great just like the previous ones.  I'm personally looking forward to more gravel stages, but hopefully this one will end up being better once you get used to the new conditions.  Edit: Also, the new challenge is the tarmac road in the middle of a dirt landscape, get one side of your wheels on the dirt and you'll be flying/spinning out fast."

dirtgame,3bg1hm,WillMase,17,Sun Jun 28 22:17:25 2015 UTC,Also they need to soften the roadbanks in a way that doesn't make the driveable road wider.
dirtgame,3bg1hm,shunen,8,Mon Jun 29 01:12:21 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I can remember an old CMR or WRC game where snow and gravel banks slowed your car significantly as your tyres sank into them slightly. That would be better than being launched into orbit or barrel rolling into trees.
dirtgame,3bg1hm,SleepingInTraffic,2,Mon Jun 29 11:14:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think that if they made the roadbanks of Greece like just piles of gravel, I think it could be a case where if you hit them you are slowed down a fair bit and slowly pull in the direction you hit them?"
dirtgame,3bg1hm,spodermanSWEG,6,Mon Jun 29 07:09:18 2015 UTC,"Bushes could act similar to how they do in GTA V; You can drive through them, but they induce drag and pull your car."

dirtgame,3bg0e6,Zheiko,2,Mon Jun 29 08:38:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah replays would be a good idea, maybe only make them available after you've done your own run. Since it's only one cheater so far, it's probably easy enough to just ban him from the leaderboards."
dirtgame,3bg0e6,Carlen67,2,Mon Jun 29 11:57:14 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is, that majority of developers doesnt even react on these cheaters... I remember from several days after launch on Pcars, a guy cheated first spot, and he is there till today... if you watch his ghost, game crashes..."

Fact: there are cheats that give you better acceleration and brakes. Fact: there are cheats that freezes the timer so that you can finish on any time you want to.   There are several consistent very fast guys out there that streams or uploads daily videos of their events, when these guys loses a minute to a guy popping up on the scoreboard for the first time ever, there is ample reason to cry foul.  The developers have stated they have cleared out a lot of 1 minute runs, (as if that is something to be proud about)  ...these are only the fucktards that don't even attempt to put up ""legit"" looking times.

dirtgame,3bemeh,kalabaleek,4,Sun Jun 28 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I agree.  This game is just begging for more content, and CM (as much as I appreciate what they are doing) will never be able to keep up with the community's appetite for content... and also the sim community's love of creating it.  It would be the cat's pajamas if CM were to make some simple handles for adding tracks, cars, or whatever, and having it be seamlessly integrated into the game (obviously there would have to be some guidelines to ensure compatibility).  But if users could just simply add a folder full of content in a specific game folder that the game would auto discover the content for this game could just explode!  I would also like it if they were to allow for deeper mods too where modders could change and tweak the physics model, game modes, etc.  I realize that this is a much tougher sell than just the cars and tracks, but it would be sweet.  Also if it could be a simple toggle integrated into the interface of the game it would be super sweet.  This way you could at launch choose what flavor of mods you want to run (say a super realistic damage mode with no restarts... or the other way)."
dirtgame,3bemeh,deadstump,7,Sun Jun 28 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"They do seem to be awfully quiet about the mods matter which makes me think they don't want anything to do with them. In my opinion this is approach is a mistake, it's been proven time and time over how user generated content is a guaranteed way for a game to live forever.  EDIT: Like Tom Bui from Valve said: ""They're going to find your files anyway, so might as well give it to them so they do your job for you"""
dirtgame,3bemeh,SkitTrick,3,Sun Jun 28 18:43:41 2015 UTC,The dev on here said he is keen to put mod support in but the higher ups need to be convinced as its not on the schedule yet.

dirtgame,3bddoc,mightystork,2,Sun Jun 28 03:56:58 2015 UTC,"Deadzone is inherent with most low-mid range consumer wheels, it's mechanical, hence the minimum torque value to overcome the friction causing the deadzone. And yes, the theory behind it is that it only affects the minimum force, rather than being a force acting on the wheel all the time. A lowest force ""threshold"" if you will.  Regarding wheel weight, what directly adds more ""heft"" throughout the range is ""Wheel friction"" and ""Tyre Friction"". The latter being dynamic, and feels like it's dampening effects more than adding a lot of weight.   ""Wheel Friction"" on the other hand is a static force which adds more weight throughout the entire range of motion and can hinder all other effects due to motor saturation, and also heavily dampens the effects. I actually kind of like the tyre friction effect, therefore left it on, Wheel friction on the other hand, i switched off, because it kills the self-aligning torque. Unfortunately, there's not much to be done with the FFB deadzone, unless you use a custom FFB .xml which adds more road surface effects even in a straight line.  The best I can think of atm is this:  http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/nerve-enhanced-ffb-for-dirt-rally-0-45.6564/  By TemplarGFX who's been slaving over this for the past few days based on feedback. Big improvement."

dirtgame,3bcl7g,Annoying_Arsehole,3,Sat Jun 27 23:54:59 2015 UTC,It would be nice to see what speed I'm doing when I go into certain corners. I just think it makes learning the track a bit easier for noobs like me.
dirtgame,3bcl7g,A1rHorn,6,Sun Jun 28 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"Not bad thinking, however you're going about it a bit wrong. Speed isn't nearly as relevant as the gear you use in the cornering.   In track racing you aim for the apex and wanna optimize the line and that is where the speed comes important, however the rally stages are so long that it is practically impossible so you'll be turning before the point used in track racing and then doing adjustments to your turn later if required by using brake and gas to control the radius of the turn.  My strategy is to decide the generics 1st like 1's and tighter -> 2nd gear, 2's 3rd gear.... however say a hairpin done uphill might actually be better done in 1st so you add exceptions.   Gears are so easy to pay attention to physically and you can pay attention to revs through sound so you can actually concentrate your eyes fully on the road."
dirtgame,3bcl7g,A1rHorn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:06:00 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at the speedo you're not looking at the stage to see ruts, berms, etc.  Unfortunately, there is no accurate way to get a speedo to help you, even in circuit racing. It takes away attention you need to avoid hazards. You're going around blind corners you've never seen in your life, and there's so much variation in road that a left 1 isn't always going to be 30mph every time.  The way I learned is to go slow at the start and look carefully. Eventually you develop an assometer that tells you how fast to go"

dirtgame,3b75ow,SimonCharles,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Occasionally yes, I feel like it depends on specific car sounds some of the time.  My biggest issue is the monotony of the co-driver. Aside from the occasional ""caution"" notes, they're read with the same apathy most of the time, regardless if it's a leisurely left 6 or a potentially fatal tightening right 3 next to a fall hundreds of meters down (mostly Greece). I'd say this is the biggest annoyance in the game at the time for me, since I play without any HUD elements. I like that you have to rely only on audio like in real life (and some familiarity with the course), and right now you have to be listening really intently to not miss a lot of important calls. I'm currently leaning towards using some HUD elements to make the game less annoying, but I'd really like to see some improvement in the calls on some of the more extreme turns.   Also, the timing of the calls seem inconsistent between the rallies, Greece seems to lag behind a lot, so I've switched to the earliest possible calls. This in turn does make the other rallies' calls too early much of the time which can also be confusing.  Finally what I'd like to see is some repetition of the calls if you fly off the course and either recover the car or have to reverse to get back on the course.

dirtgame,3b6dfv,grzzzly,8,Fri Jun 26 09:50:33 2015 UTC,"Adjust your gears so that you actually make use of the top gear during your runs. Often this means making them shorter, on the hillclimb cars though I've had to make the gear ratios longer.  on 4WD cars check the center differential and put a reasonable ratio, say 30:70 or similar, the defaults are all kinds of fucked up crap.  Monaco means lower your entire car ride height, stiffer springs. With better grip you might wanna play with brake balance depending on how it feels. On the tarmac I usually have very strong rear diff.  I like oversteery driving and having as good acceleration as possible usually. The setup will depend on your driving style."

dirtgame,3b7wth,thekrautboy,2,Fri Jun 26 19:25:28 2015 UTC,TDIL: you can overclock a monitor.
dirtgame,3b7wth,ArgentumFox,3,Sat Jun 27 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"You can't. But for some reason, there are people who call running non-standard graphics modes the monitor's perfectly capable of displaying otherwise ""overclocking"" the monitor. Makes me cringe every time I see that.  (Sorry if I'm being captain Obvious here.)"
dirtgame,3b7wth,Case_f,2,Sat Jun 27 00:13:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I  know, people are downloading a program to unlock higher refresh rates in their monitor.  Which to me is the same thing people do to overclocking their gpus. Perfectly capable,  but not a standard feature."
dirtgame,3b7wth,voodoowizard,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"It might seem the same, but it's really not. With overclocking, you make the hardware run higher than its specs, you're directly influencing the hardware - changing the voltage or frequency it runs at to get some extra power out of it. And you can't really tell beforehand how high you'll be able to overclock the given piece of hardware - it'll vary from card to card or from cpu tu cpu. You're running the hardware out of specs.  On the other hand, by unlocking non-standard display modes, you're doing absolutely nothing to the actual hardware. The monitor was always capable of displaying that display mode you ""unlocked"" without the need to change any voltages, frequencies or stuff like that, it's just that the manufacturer didn't for one reason or another add that specific display mode to the table of the supported resolutions. And once you find a display mode that works for you, you're pretty much guaranteed that such display mode will work on every single piece of that monitor ever made (unless the manufacturer changes the specs for that model). You're still within its official specs, you're just getting as close to the specs limits as possible."
dirtgame,3b7wth,Case_f,3,Sat Jun 27 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"75Hz isn't supported by the panel @ 1920x1080 though, and you do need to tweak some values to get there. Sure it's not simple as just ramping up the refresh rate since you need to stay under DVI specifications, but I don't see how it's different than overclocking a GPU or CPU. I'm running it out of spec, every panel is different and I don't know which frequencies are possible.  A table entry working for one panel definitively isn't **going to work on any other random panel. Furthermore you might be able to run anything valid under a total of a 165MHz pixel Clock for HDMI/DVI, but it's no guarantee your display will be capable of that, you need to verify it not skipping frames.  Some GPUs also just use the same-ish core as higher priced ones, but run at a lower clock. Is running those at higher frequencies not overclocking then? The core is very capable of it, the manufacturer just dialed in something lower."
dirtgame,3b7wth,Case_f,0,Sat Jun 27 07:26:33 2015 UTC,"No, you're not running it out of spec, and you totally miss the point.  But whatever, by all means enjoy your ""overclocked"" monitor. Just please don't call it overclocking, thanks."
dirtgame,3b7wth,tru3gam3r,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:59:58 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're being really fucking pedantic. The specs say 75hz at 1080p is not supported. He made it work. Just like 5Ghz on an i7-4790k isn't supported, but we can also make it work. Its still overclocking."
dirtgame,3b7wth,Case_f,0,Mon Jun 29 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"If by ""being really fucking pedantic"" you mean something along the lines of using the correct terms for specific things instead of just calling things whatever they like, then yes, I am indeed really fucking pedantic and you're neither the first nor the last to tell me that.  Which, incidentally, also means that I don't agree with you on ""the specs say 75Hz at 1080p is not supported"". The marketing materials most likely say exactly that, yes, on that we would agree. However, if you take the true technical specs for that monitor, I'm pretty sure you'll find that given its horizontal and vertical frequency range, it IS actually perfectly capable of running 75 Hz at 1080p out of the box, which is exactly the reason why he's been able to make it work, and also exactly the reason why he didn't in fact ""overclock"" anything at all.  And yes, I understand some people would call it ""really fucking pedantic"" and think I'm an incredible asshole (and obviously go and downvote me like on that last comment). I don't really blame them. Still, words have certain specific meanings and if we ignore them and just call things as we like them to be called instead of what they really are, we'll never get anywhere when talking to each other."
dirtgame,3b7wth,LooneyJuice,2,Mon Jun 29 22:44:27 2015 UTC,"Ditto on the Vsync. The smoothness is incredible compared to Vsync off, the frame timing is just off otherwise. Since i'm on an IPS panel, it was so bad at times I had a hard time discerning distant objects what with the inherent slight motion blur and all. Vsync in Dirt Rally is as smooth as butter."
dirtgame,3b7wth,shadowofashadow,2,Sat Jun 27 03:55:23 2015 UTC,I'd be careful here. V sync can introduce input lag.  Are  you sure it doesn't look smoother because you increased the anti aliasing?
dirtgame,3b7wth,shadowofashadow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"Smoother, as in, less jerky. Anti-Aliasing was just something that turned out to have a slight enough impact it didn't pull my frames down below 75.  Vsync hasn't introduced any input lag I could notice. Some other games do have input lag, but DiRT Rally seems to handle this fine. Hence, turn it on if you're having a bad experience even at very high framerates.  In general, Vsync does introduce display delay of one-three frames, in worst case depending on what kind of Vsync you're using and how many frames your GPU is pumping out, but that's pretty much negligible with most monitors having an input delay of ~30ms anyway.  Me, I'm using an overclocked U2312HM with a <1ms input lag."

dirtgame,3b6nj5,clasificado,2,Mon Jun 29 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"So, I exactly know what you talk about and its like I have written it. Dirt rally finally got my attention again, after I gave up with the games when Dirt 1 was released and since then on, I was just hoping for new ones. The day Dirt Rally got into Early Access, I went and bought G25 right away. I have never before used steering wheel in any simulation games, always just keyboard or controller.  That day, I turned off all assists, and set on Hshifter with clutch. Full setup, well... needless to say, that what you are showing in the video is still considered pro in comparison of what I did my first run with that setup.  I said to myself, that rally is way too difficult to start will all of those, but once I will turn on automatic shifting, I will never force myself into learning new things again.  So I decided to not run Dirt for a while, and jumped into other simulation games, that were actually on track, so I bought Pcars and Assetto Corsa and began training there, managed to learn how to control the car for several weeks and how to manage all of those things at confidential pace.  Then I came back to Dirt Rally, that was still before the FFB update, so I had my steering wheel set on 300degrees, and managed to learn basics.  Now I am running on soft lock, fully manual without any assists, and am well capable of finishing majority of online events in top tiers.  But still long way ahead of me, but its fun, and its rewarding"
dirtgame,3b6nj5,Zheiko,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"Great to hear that. I also toyed with the idea of practising on track with the games you mention :).   But in the video it's not my first run with the wheel, just my first run with manual transmission. I decided to play with automatic because all the input was overwhelming at first. But I got to comfortable with that and finally switched to manual, so I have to adjust my driving style.  It's great to see that there are more players with this opinion - game is challenging, rewarding - fun :)"
dirtgame,3b685s,GTOfire,8,Fri Jun 26 08:31:36 2015 UTC,Sometimes when I'm in gear it pops back to neutral..  I don't know why
dirtgame,3b685s,zondape,3,Fri Jun 26 11:06:07 2015 UTC,"I got one after a hard jump.. I think the game has coded in gear errors which is completely stupid, as none of the other gear options seem to suffer from them. (not that having them implemented is totally stupid)  The clutch is also very stupidly made, more often than not rally cars with clutch + h-shifter shifted without clutch because they needed the left foot on the brake. It is possible in real world, should be possible in the game for correct gameplay and current modeling is just stupid. I hope it would be changed towards more realistic approach where the gears can change without clutch if the rpms are correct and so on. Currently it is just totally arcade and too difficult to use compared to real life that I just wont use it apart from testing it out. :("

dirtgame,3b685s,RiftRacer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:00:37 2015 UTC,":) If you have it often, could you try and pay attention to how you shift? Because I've nailed down my problem to 100% user error essentially, because I already take the gear lever out of gear in the same motion as pushing down the clutch pedal. That's when it already fails, because I'm essentially not declutched while starting the shift.  Try it in game and see if you do the same, because especially when downshifting rapidly for a hard braking zone I'm personally prone to doing the motions so quickly that they become too simultaneous. Doing everything a bit more smoothly and conciously has all but fixed the issue for me.   Now that said it'd still be lovely if they could make it more forgiving, considering it's perhaps a bit too strict now, but at least it wasn't a bug for me that was causing the issue."

dirtgame,3b2ig7,axxor-,2,Thu Jun 25 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"The other option I see is to take 15 real player (like Career AI) that are near your time from yesterdays daily or, career times, or whatevertimes. And ""compete"" with them, get results screen just like in the singleplayer, with the 16 real players, so you have a chance to ""compete and beat"" them, make it stay the same for a couple days or a week in Daily Event (<-your 16 group player pool I mean) and see if you can win the week vs similar speed players.   After these results (per stage) you can show the overall daily leaderboard, like it does now.  Adds some more competition, for every skill level, but without splitting anything up!"
dirtgame,3b2ig7,jaggafoxy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:25:15 2015 UTC,That would be neat.  As long as you could run against the same people week after week since it would crappy to get placed into a group at the bottom each week.

dirtgame,3b2ig7,blackrabt,2,Thu Jun 25 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"To expand on my previous ""Yes"".  I would like the stages to be made of one (minimum) really long stage.  Right now each 'long' stage is two 'short' stages (four sectors each).  I would like it if it was at least four 'short' stages long... the number of ways you could slice that stage would be pretty cool.    Also it would be a good idea IMO if they made a short piece of connector road (like a sector long) between the two existing 'long' stages in each country so that they could be joined together to make a 'mega' stage... also would open up interesting slicing options.  But yea, another 'long' stage or two for each country would be sweet."

dirtgame,3b2503,dromtrund,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"They're notoriously overpowered, with turbos and up to 500bhp. Compared to the 60s, 70s and 80s RWD cars, they're like riding dragons on heroin. The modern cars (and Group A) are powerful, but more balanced, with matching handling capabilities. I feel a lot more in control with them at least.  I don't know if you're doing career, but driving the 60s and 70s classes are defineatly worth it. They're vastly different, with different challenges and upsides. I always do a couple of gravel stages in all cars in a class before I decide on which one I like best, and buy it in career. I went with the Fulvia in 60s, Escort MKII (by far my favorite car in the game) in 70s, and skipped the 80s RWD, as they all felt too much like sleds on ice to be enjoyable. I went with the 205 in Group B, as the RS200 felt a little oversteery, and the Lancia felt waaay too dangerous. It's all a matter of preference, though.  Stepping into Group A or modern cars is probably a fun ""upgrade"" on your RS200, but if you go backwards in history, you're gonna have a very different experience handling wise, and I really recommend it (especially if you find yourself crashing a lot)"

I drive with a PS3 controller, so I guess we're in the same boat :)  I liked the Mini the most in 60s, but went with the Fulvia on a whim. It understeers like hell, I have to fight it every corner to get it around. I've spent like 80% of my in-game time in the Escort MkII, and it's just wonderful. On gravel, you can be done steering by the time I actually enter the corner, and just slide through it without touching the stick. I haven't found any other car that does this, and it's such an awesome feeling when you get it right (also it's pretty fucking fast, as you're accelerating out of the corner before it even begins). I find the 205 to be fun because it's scary powerful, yet it's possible to maintain some control."

dirtgame,3b2aqm,junneh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:36:32 2015 UTC,Thank you.  All default settings on the car I'm afraid :P. You just have to fight with it a lot and make sure you have your weight in the right place (using the brake). And more so in Wales use the camber in the road to your advantage.  I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to setup so I always just drive with the default car setups.
dirtgame,3b2920,Holyd1ver,3,Thu Jun 25 11:31:38 2015 UTC,"Loosen the rear diff somewhat, adjust brake balance. Perhaps adjust gearing, stratos has quite short gears."
dirtgame,3b2920,mmm1kko,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:43:23 2015 UTC,"The daily challenge uses the default setup (which I really like for Wales events).  I basically use the default setup with 1 click lower fast bump, 1 click lower fast rebound threshold, 1 click lower fast bump, & 1 click lower fast rebound for front and back to help the suspension absorb the bumps.  I shortened the gears to 6.3 from 6.5 and I raised the ride height to +0.5 for front and I think +0.6 for the rear.  The Stratos is without a doubt one of my favorite cars in the game.  Once you get comfortable with it, you can really be aggressive."

It's pretty easy to do once you realize how the file works.  I've done so for my MS Sidewinder wheel to get around precisely this problem (and the solution is still relevant, as even though the latest patch supposedly added support for my wheel, it doesn't really work properly still and even forces me to reach for my keyboard for pretty much any menu controls, while with my modification I can do almost anything just by using the wheel).  The XML files are located in the game install folder under /input. Yours would be called lg_momo_racing.xml. Take a look at my Sidewinder file if you want to get an idea on how to do the modifications:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/d05rlgna10mqrpg/ms_sidewinder_ffb.xml?dl=0  You're interested in the definitions of ""Menu Left Shoulder"" and ""Menu Right Shoulder"". I've mapped the missing functions to shift paddles, which in the case of my wheel are buttons di_button_6 and di_button_7. The number of the button is one less than the number the game shows you when you try to bind that button - in my case the shift paddles are buttons 7 and 8 in-game, but in the XML, the button numbers start at 0 instead of at 1, so button 7 in-game is button 6 in the XML file, button 8 is button 7 and so on."

dirtgame,3avh7j,Jard16,18,Tue Jun 23 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Well honestly, whether on or off, it doesn't really matter until a game requires the use of the effects using the damper. Regarding wheel friction, I'm running 100% damper, and all in-game effects are at 100% minus the wheel friction which is actually at 0%.  Now, regarding the heavier steering being more realistic. First, it depends on how heavy. The wheel friction setting isn't a dynamic force, it is static, meaning that it persists throughout the range of movement, and due to hardware limitations, you are basically adding weight to the detriment of all other effects, since it dampens them, makes them feel muddier, and basically uses up motor torque in favor of weight. Therefore you might feel some more weight at center, but you're killing a lot of other feedback.  Now, I usually run damper at 0% for most other games/sims, and the thinking behind that - and for other people as well I believe - is that, as mentioned above, you do not want something ""muddying"" the signal. The wheel weight at center, for logitech wheels, could be remedied by a dynamic ""minimum torque setting"". To elaborate, logitech wheels are known to have a pretty substantial deadzone in the FFB, which is in part caused by too much friction in the system below a certain torque threshold. Simply, if a force isn't strong enough to overcome the friction of the system, it will not register. That's where a minimum torque setting would come in handy. So basically 0 damper or 0 wheel friction and therefore some deadzone, is the price I'm willing to pay knowing the technical limitations of my wheel in order to enjoy higher feedback fidelity.  TL;DR  0 damper/0 wheel friction = more pronounced/detailed effects  100 damper/>0 wheel friction = less detailed effects/weaker self-aligning torque (very important imo)/ heavier steering  EDIT: Due to the stronger/higher frequency feedback provided by gravel stages, even with wheel friction at 0, there's plenty of feedback through the wheel to eliminate a lot of the FFB deadzone, as opposed to Monte Carlo, where most of the feedback has to either come from bumps, wheel deflection, cambers etc."

dirtgame,3atbsc,shidarin,2,Tue Jun 23 16:30:35 2015 UTC,What sort of driving problems are you having?
dirtgame,3atbsc,deadstump,3,Tue Jun 23 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"General suckage- I haven't done a rally game since I 100%d Dirt 2, so even a lot of the basics like proper drifting technique have been lost. In most games, this isn't a problem because I would learn as I was progressing through the game.  In Dirt Rally, the learning process is really unforgiving and does not let you make any progression. I made the mistake of buying the shitty Lancia as my first car, and it took me weeks to realize that not all of the terrible driving was entirely my fault- so then rather than progress, I dumped money in the Mini cooper- determined to do the 1960s decently.   As I kept doing the 1960s, and not placing very highly (so not making money), I kept researching and learned that the tuning wasn't very good. So fine, messed with the tuning a whole lot, then less and less and finally got something I was comfortable with. This whole time I'm still stuck in the 1960s. Have to spend money on the mechanics contract and all so I don't lose all those (all 1960) miles.   In the meantime, the only money earning online events I can do are the dailies. Can't do the weeklies, can't do the monthlies- I don't own any of the fucking cars (sorry for the expletive, but it's really fucking annoying).   Finally, I started to do well- I placed in to the top 3 and made some money... and then immediately I was bumped up to the next level, where I promptly finish poorly again. The only way I'm doing well is by restarting the stage constantly until I have a near perfect first half of the stage. Just when I thought I had it down, just when I thought I had it beat, fucking codemasters releases an update that increases the difficulty across the board, and the CPU is now getting even better times, even at the lowest difficulty level.   I stopped playing then (what was that, a few weeks ago?). I played daily for a month, and in the end I was able to buy one car in the 1970s. I understand this is a rally racing simulating. I don't want the game to be easy, but I'm also not enjoying it when the payout scale is so messed up that at the lowest difficulty level, that it's literally impossible to make enough money to progress through the game. Isn't that what the difficulty level is FOR?"
dirtgame,3atbsc,shidarin,5,Tue Jun 23 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"I know that this is going to sound patronizing, but here it goes.  Drive slower and just keep it on the road, go fast where you can see and know what is going on, and slow down where you have any doubts.  Turn in early because it is easier to let yourself go wide then it is to tighten it up.  Admittedly I am a bit more brushed up on rally games than it sounds like you are, but I have never won a rally and often am down in fifth or sixth each time I get promoted to the next difficulty or change cars.  I just shut off the splits and drive my own race and try to improve my clean stage count.  But hey, good news.  The weekly this week is 60s and the monthly is 70s, so you should be able to round up some dosh (unless you drive right off the first hairpin and are forced to retire like I have done on several occasions).  I also have a driving techniques that I made for /r/simrally's wiki.  It may include some information that will help.  Good luck out there."

I am actually enjoying it here more since the other drivers seem to battle a bit more (although that top step never seems to fuck up or battle the guy in second).

dirtgame,3aqyoc,Zheiko,27,Mon Jun 22 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Gear ratio is only part of the answer.  Any Group-A, and even some Group-N, rally car is going to have Anti-Lag of some sort installed. So even off idle, the turbo is making adequate boost pressure, to produce a significant amount of torque on demand. Where as on a road car, the intake will start pulling a vacuum before it gets enough puff into the exhaust to get the turbo spooling, where it can start to force feed the engine. Which is where that ""cough, dip, chug, POWA!!!!!!!"" on launch comes from that you have experienced. So that fat torque band from anti-lag will get you going with the kind of relative ease that no road car can manage.  As it relates to the game, I would imagine there is also a bit of ""clutch assist"" taking place, which is probably also helping to prevent that sputter stall from happening.  That said, a proper AWD launch, especially on a loose surface, is not about dumping the clutch. Its about getting the car rolling, and feeding in the power to exploit the grip levels from all 4 wheels. Its a progressive affair, and when done  properly, can provide far more acceleration than any clutch dump ever would.  In virtually any professionally prepared top class car, they usually have a start procedure built into the ECU, which will perform two critical functions. Limit engine RPM, and enable maximum Anti-Lag boost pressure. This works in parallel with monitoring the clutch position sensor, or a hand brake position sensor, that will notify the ECU whenever they are engaged/disengaged to move out of this ""start mode"" into ""full tilt boogie mode"".  When they come to the line, and select the start program, put the car in gear, hold the hand brake, bring the revs up, and find the bite point on the clutch. At this point the ECU limits engine RPM so that there is no excess acceleration loss through wheel spin at start. The Anti-lag is churning away for maximum boost to keep the torque peak at an optimal level. Start clock triggers, driver releases the hand brake. Because the clutch bit point is already being held, the car starts to move forward before the handbrake has even fully disengaged. The driver, already having his right foot to the floor, needs only focus on releasing the clutch, which while done quickly, is done at a gradual pace to allow for slight slippage at the start, but quickly transitioning to full engagement before the top of first gear is ever reached. Meanwhile, the cars ECU recognizing the hand brakes release, or the clutchs position change, releases the RPM cut, and allows for maximum revs. Because the car is at maximum boost and holding, this increase in engine output directly correlates with rapid acceleration. Because the car is at a dead stop, and the drivetrain under full load, the amount of wheel spin is negligible, and somewhat required for maximum acceleration. By now the clutch is fully engaged, the car is at or near maximum revs, second gear is selected, and the car is back to its regular ""race mode"" ECU setting.  On less modern cars the procedure is more or less the same, but completely driver controlled. Holding revs right on the bite point of the clutch, flooring the throttle on start, and progressively releasing the clutch as you go through the acceleration phase. The key to it all is holding that bite point, so that you don't send a massive amount of torque shock through the drivetrain. Not only does that break things, but it can also cause poor traction, and a slow start from bogging down.  Here is a good video to illustrate some of what I am talking about. https://youtu.be/ePcIy9Occnk?t=27  Ignoring the first blue car, the second white car that comes up, is a S2000 non-turbo car. But it has a start system. You can hear them select first gear, and rev the car, but for whatever reason (maybe they released the handbrake on accident?) it did not engage properly. Note that when they rev the car, they climb up, there is no rev-cut taking place. So they put the car back in neutral, re-selects the start procedure, puts the car back into first, and rev the car again, and NOW we can hear the soft rev limit, as the car sputters, he builds revs to the rev-limit, we see the cars rear end dip on the bight point of the clutch, and release the handbrake to launch the car forward.  The next car up is an older Skoda Otavia WRC car, which has an older style ""Bang-Bang"" anti-lag system. The same set-up is present though. And we can see the car load up on the clutch, then launch softly away, and build speed as it goes. Note the ""wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh"" juddering as the car pulls away. This is partly the engine under load, and partly the clutch juddering as it is fully engaging.  Next up is the orange Subaru, same as before, we hear him select first, give the car a couple of test revs to ensure the rev-limiter is working properly, then bring the car up to revs right before the wave off, and again we hear some minor clutch judder as it pulls away, again with a soft start, and gradual increase in speed.  That isn't to say its always perfect though, and that a bad driver cant similarly fuck it up. Here in this video you can see plenty of examples of people getting it wrong. https://youtu.be/zJwdQ1u5bic And you will also notices the slight ""cough, dip, POWA!!!!!"" from a couple of the cars, as they dumped the clutch, and bogged it. But you will note that the recovery is very quick, because the antilag recovers the revs almost immediately, and once the car is rolling, the power delivery comes right in and takes over. Also notice that some of the cars are creeping at the start, because they are to far beyond the bite point of the clutch, and cant hold it with the hand brake alone. But you can at least, now knowing what to look for, see examples of its being done right, and being done completely wrong. Now you just need to apply it real world, and you will be set. ;)"
dirtgame,3aqyoc,Buck-O,5,Mon Jun 22 21:51:18 2015 UTC,"wow, thats one hell of a answer! Thanks!  I dont think I will be trying it with my daily driver, that doesnt have antilag nor rev limiter.  Just one question though, do they set up the launch rev limiter at where the highest torque peaks?"
dirtgame,3aqyoc,Buck-O,3,Tue Jun 23 00:50:03 2015 UTC,"Haha, well, you don't need to have all of that to do it on your road car. You just need to get some muscle memory built up in your feet, so you can hold enough revs to get on boost effectively after the roll out, and have enough clutch control to gently feed the power in. It can be done, but like anything else, it requires practice, and slowly building up to that point. Not trying to go all in from the start, and fail your way down to the limit. That will never work, and your wallet will feel it more than your car will.  As for the rev limit, it really depends on the car, and what they are going for with their acceleration phase. Typically, no, you wouldn't want it on the highest torque output point. Otherwise, you would have a considerably higher chance of inducing wheel spin. Ideally, you would want to get the car rolling right below peak torque, so that you arrive at peak torque in the moment where the car is moving fast enough that you can exploit the maximum forward grip from the tires, without the potential of wheelspin, and maximize the cars power. So the start phase is riding that rising torque curve through the initial acceleration phase.  That isn't always the case, however, in some cases you actually WANT some wheel speed, and a little extra wheel spin to bit into the surface harder, like in Sweden for example, where you need that wheel speed to get the studs into the ice for maximum grip, or in a less than idea tarmac surface. Each rally is going to be different, and each car is going to be different. Good luck getting any engineer or rally team to divulge that kind of information though."
dirtgame,3aqyoc,Annoying_Arsehole,3,Tue Jun 23 01:17:45 2015 UTC,Gear ratios. Rally cars often have significantly shorter ratios and thus deliver more torque. Start in the 2nd gear and it will behave like you're used to or mess with the ratios.

dirtgame,3akivr,mmm1kko,4,Mon Jun 22 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"I would love some extra variety, of course. I'm trying not to overdo it with Dirt Rally at this point (emphasis on ""trying""), because I really don't want to learn the stages by heart just from the hours I'm putting in, I really love having audio pace notes only and getting into a rhythm according to a given stage, instead of driving by memory. That said, I think more rallies would remedy that issue for me, since 12 stages isn't bad per rally. Of course, more would be better, and especially for masters championships, since you're basically running through the same stages all the time, albeit in different weather conditions or time of day.  I will say though, since we've been shown the way CM go about creating the rallies and such, it appears they accumulate all the source material in one big go and then create the stages in the studio. Therefore they're a direct product of each research trip. Thus, I find the addition of more stages for existing rallies a little unlikely. It'd be a killer idea nonetheless though."
dirtgame,3akivr,LooneyJuice,3,Sun Jun 21 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"I like the idea. Wales is my favorite and I would love to see more stages in that country. They can use the same assets to create new ones.

dirtgame,3akivr,dj_sasek,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, +1. I would like to see more stages (and by that I mean proper ""new"" stages in each location, not existing stages cut in a different way) as well.

dirtgame,3ain06,IIISidekickIII,7,Sat Jun 20 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"Two things:  Rally is all a game of weight transfer. If you understeer its because you don't have enough weight forward, or you're over working the grip of the front tires, probably by trying to brake too hard while turning.  Sliding sideways is a good way to slow the car down. Try entering corners off throttle and brake, to see how the car reacts.  Turn early and hard, catch the slide and throttle out."
dirtgame,3ain06,Phr00t,2,Sat Jun 20 17:25:32 2015 UTC,Work on my weight transer. Got it and thanks!
dirtgame,3ain06,deadstump,6,Sat Jun 20 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"So I wrote up a driving technique section in /r/simrally's wiki, and Here is a link to that.  As for the your specific driving questions.  For one the Group B cars are not the easiest to drive.  Group A or the WRC cars are much more responsive (although I love my Lancia Group B).  For the hairpins if you do trail braking in addition to the hand brake you will get more rotation.  Your flicks looked ok, if a bit slow... it just takes practice to get the timing.  Also you kind of have to just wait until your car is lined up before building the throttle otherwise it will just induce a lot of understeer coming out of the turn (like what happened in your video).    I personally like to set my cars up to understeer under normal conditions and this allows me to induce the oversteer at will through the use of my left foot, flicking, and/or the handbrake."
dirtgame,3ain06,danevo,2,Sat Jun 20 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I'm gonna try a group A or WRC car around the same track. I'm also going to read your post on driving technique. Thanks again."
dirtgame,3ain06,vmaxmuffin,5,Sat Jun 20 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"I recommend you go through career mode, you start off in slow front wheel drive which is a little easier to get the hang of how rally driving works ... then work your way up through RWD and 4WD, when you learn the technique it will get easier to drive the bigger cars as you progress.   I have found that persistence is the best way to learn, fail and fail some more until you figure it out. Slow in and fast out of the corners is a basic rule, if your coming in too hot, and slam the brakes on last minute you will just slide into the bend and under-steer every time ... driving the slower cars might un-teach any bad habits you might have in the 4wd.  What you said about the pointy front end might be ideal when you have aced it - until then I would Toe-Out for maximum stability first or you will be all over the place."
dirtgame,3ain06,MahNilla,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I straight up hate any FWD car. I hate it when the car understeers like crazy and it doesnt really fit my driving style(Pointy front, loose rear). (Pointy front, loose rear) But im gonna keep on practising. Thanks for the advice"
dirtgame,3ain06,danevo,3,Sat Jun 20 19:00:02 2015 UTC,I hate FWD cars too but I think it's important to drive them anyway. They teach you to keep up your momentum and to flick the cars into corners
dirtgame,3ain06,Phr00t,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"Try messing around with some of the settings, I'm pretty sure by messing with the diff and some other settings you can settle the front down. With brake bias you can get some oversteer to to help counteract the understeer.  Not sure if this is what the pros do but I found it helped some."
dirtgame,3ain06,mmm1kko,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:08:35 2015 UTC,I hate them too RWD is most fun and 4WD for the win. Good luck though!
dirtgame,3ain06,acker123,3,Sun Jun 21 09:43:31 2015 UTC,"Also, watching your video, you're turning late, you have to turn earlier. And when you're going around a hairpin with a scandinavian flick, in an AWD/4WD car, as soon as you romp on the throttle, the car STOPS rotating. Be patient with the gas pedal for when the car has enough rotation to clear the corner/hairpin."
dirtgame,3ain06,acker123,2,Sat Jun 20 21:54:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, first reconfig your FFB, on LG profiler put 105/0/0, spring off, 540deg is okay. In the game turn all FFB to 65% or lower.  In driving, try driving the A class cars 1st, subaru I suggest. Turn in before corners, don't aim for apex, shift down before or while turning in and then turn on the gas to power out of the corners. In longer tight corners you might have to down shift two gears and then redline the engine through the corner. Use the clutch to keep revs high.  Weight transfer -> on gas = the turning radius increases (less weight on front wheels, letting of gas the weight transfers slowly more to front wheels -> tighter cornering, brake -> even tighter unless you lock it, in the setup you might wanna change the braking force to avoid locking up, or perhaps set brake saturation to 120% in the controller setup."

dirtgame,3airab,danevo,2,Sat Jun 20 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on what you use to play (I use a controller personally (If you want a specific league for not using wheels, me and D0cal run ControllerBros)) it's a lot better to turn the assists off altogether (with the possible exception of ABS, it can be useful on tarmac) for the most part tho I still use chase-cam, not quite used to in-car view yet.  The assists in this game are a bit confusing as both Stability Control and Traction Control will take a lot of the control AWAY from you. You need to send the car sideways at times otherwise you'll just crash.  Also, practice. I won the Masters championship earlier using a controller so it's not impossible.  Also if you're grinding stages and you crash, before you restart, think to yourself 'why did I crash?' Did you overcook a corner? Did you hit a hazard on the inside or outside of the road? Did you mistake the call from the co-driver?  It does get grindy, but you get used to it."

A good example is when I did a Greece stage ""Fouketa Kourva"" in monthly. I did a decent time (3:10) and expected the best time to be about 15-20 sec faster. But to my suprise, the best time was 2:30 with a 70's car, 40 sec faster than me wich is impossible without cut/cheat."

I've got #1 in a few classes and top 5 in most others there, but I know even on my #1 group B time I bet there's a good 10 seconds or more to be shaved with a cleaner run and better tune (usually run damn near stock).  Might not be #1 anymore for that reason.  I remember one dev interview saying there is a lowest possible time for each stage, and if you somehow get a faster time than that, it won't display ( you just get the fastest they've deemed possible ).  This seems like a fair way of running it, they're apparently setting those times with someone ultra-fast who has a debug-menu with the old rewind feature, so they can get every single corner and segment perfect.  So unless that's changed or I misinterpreted, those times you see could be possible, save any actual cheating somehow."

dirtgame,3ag9sk,Vibesy,-2,Sat Jun 20 16:03:37 2015 UTC,so you think automagically mod support will increase the popularity of the game 10 fold?
dirtgame,3ag9sk,modonaut,2,Sat Jun 20 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"First I think charts are deceptive. If you want to argue that Dirt Rally, which isn't close to release yet, is doing bad based on that chart, then CM really has something to worry about when looking at this chart or this.  Second, there is no doubt that mods have substantially contributed to the popularity of ETS2. Base game content in ETS2 would be covered in a matter of weeks, days if you play it intensively. With map mods it is infinite. And don't forget that mutiplayer is a mod for that game. Doesn't hurt DLC sales either since many mods require the DLC."
dirtgame,3ag9sk,doctorocteer,-1,Sat Jun 20 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"I think you are right, CM really does have something to worry about.  Its a shame as they really deserve a huge hit with this game, I really have no idea how to turn this into the success it deserves, but I don't think mod support alone will suffice.  In order for a game to have community developed content, you need a community first..  And no matter of the accuracy of the charts, there should be little doubt they are an comparable indicator on market performance"
dirtgame,3ag9sk,mightystork,2,Sat Jun 20 16:42:04 2015 UTC,"Well they have marketing people for that :) But the bottom line is it's a niche game as a sim within another niche i.e. rally games. As such, I think they are doing very well with it so far.   Mod support won't turn it into a hit necessarily. But the game is extremely solid and mod support should extend the lifespan of the game by keeping players interested for far longer. It is also a selling point for some players.  The other option is to go the Dirt or Grid route, meaning no mod support and try to sell constant streams of DLC to a dwindling player base. I don't think that approach has worked out all that well for them."

dirtgame,3afpas,deadstump,12,Fri Jun 19 19:31:32 2015 UTC,"Lee, I am loving the new FFB, it makes driving a lot more intuitive and even with leaving the rotation far beyond what I am used to to driving it feels good.  Really the only fault I have with new FFB is that it doesn't center itself during stoppages (like at the start of a stage or when you get rescued).  Having a feature where it would find its center in these situations would be very helpful.  I can hear the howls of ""unrealistic"" now, but allow me to defend it.  At the start of a stage you will have had to drive up to the start line and I would presume that when you drove up to the line you would have your wheels straight.  And if you have ever gotten pushed out of a ditch you will know that having your wheels pointed straight is more or less necessary, so after a rescue you would also have you wheel centered.  I think for ""how"" I would do it would be for while paused or at least ""out of game"" I would apply a force similar to when you are going over a cambered section of road.  Completely fightable, but present and noticeable.  Keep on kicking ass!  Really looking forward to Germany!  Edit:  Maybe if there was just a warning that your wheels were not straight with a little pointer arrow that goes away once you get going... I don't know.  I would prefer the auto center."
dirtgame,3afpas,dick-van-dyke,3,Fri Jun 19 20:03:18 2015 UTC,Second that. Several times I ended up in the ditch twice in quick succession.
dirtgame,3afpas,Zheiko,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:40:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts my friend, was thinking how to justify it yesterday, as i ended upnin ditch twice and it actually makes sense to get it centered, or after rescue, if not straighten the wheels, give us less penalty and put there 3seconds countdown(so the time lost is same) but we have those few seconds to actually prepare"
dirtgame,3afpas,LooneyJuice,8,Mon Jun 22 08:21:44 2015 UTC,"Well, after some copious tweaking, figuring out settings and the like, and rectifying calibration mistakes (woops). It's actually pretty bang on, and rather subtle I must say. I can't speak for other wheels besides the G25/27, since I know their limitations (ffb deadzone and the like), but compared with what i usually experience by way of FFB, I'm loving it.   Weight transfer (after getting rid of wheel friction) is very apparent, road cambers are very nicely transmitted, which in turn loosens the death grip on the wheel having to compensate by visuals alone. All in all, stellar job.  The only thing I can think of would be to have a ""minimum force/torque"" setting for wheels like the G25/27 so as to eliminate the ffb deadzone/friction (like we can in some sims). After I found my settings though, I can't find anything else wrong with it.  Also, soft lock is kick-ass."
dirtgame,3afpas,Jard16,8,Fri Jun 19 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's definitely an improvement but as someone new to sim racing games I still have no idea what each slider actually does.    ""Wheel Friction – scales the static friction of the wheel.""    I can say I honestly have no idea what that means! I think it means makes the wheel feel heavier and slows down the self-correction but would love to have that in layman's terms from the devs."
dirtgame,3afpas,SLiiDE101,7,Fri Jun 19 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"FFB feels great overall, although I still think it feels a bit ""numb"" on tarmac stages. Not really sure what's wrong with it, but it just feels a bit lifeless compared to how it feels on gravel stages.  I'd also Like to see some explanation on the FFB sliders, to clear up what each slider does and how it effects the FFB in game. most of the stuff is common sense as to what its referring to (for example, its fairly obvious the suspension slider is related to feeling bumps through the wheel) but it can be difficult to understand what each slider does to effect the FFB."
dirtgame,3afpas,Talpaman,3,Fri Jun 19 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, the ffb on tarmac is pretty dead, considering that we are racing on old mountain roads. They can't be that smooth.   I don't want to be taken the wrong way, but you guys could try assetto corsa and try to imitate that feeling, on the asphalt. I know they are two completely different technologies, but if someone makes something completely right, you should use it as inspiration without feeling bad.

dirtgame,3afhff,greatestname,3,Fri Jun 19 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"You have steering saturation set to 65%, which makes for an effective rotation of 348°. I don't think any of the cars have a rotation smaller than that, so soft lock does not have any effect as it never engages.  20% brake deadzone? OK...  I would not use center spring at all, it just messes things up with the self aligning torque effect. Same for spring and damper.  Good luck with the tinkering :)"

dirtgame,3aci3r,mightystork,3,Fri Jun 19 00:11:44 2015 UTC,I did something similar with my G27. I think the key is keeping the spring & damper at 100 in the profiler. When they were at 0 I had that dead weighted center and hated the feel.    It seems like a better idea to keep those two at 100 and adjust the wheel friction in-game to your desired heaviness feel.    I turned the overall effects down to 65 because I was getting clipping before that.
dirtgame,3aci3r,Jard16,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:08:48 2015 UTC,Could you describe what clipping feels like? I've heard it mentioned a few times and I had a feeling I would be clipping the signal by moving some settings beyond 100%.
dirtgame,3aci3r,Jard16,2,Fri Jun 19 04:07:12 2015 UTC,It feels like the wheel binding up then letting go. It's like a skipping in the gears or excessive rattling or shaking.

Overall the biggest improvement for me was the feeling when counter-steering, especially coming out of tight corners in RWD cars.  Weirdest thing I've noticed since the update is that it feels like the level of FFB is changing as I go around a constant radius corner on tarmac.  Maybe this is an effect due to bumps and undulations, but it doesn't feel like that in real life at all.  This feels more like my power steering system is failing and the level of power assistance is fluctuating despite a constant steering angle."

I'd like more punishing damage for collisions, but more sensible damage for other situations (collapse the suspension, bend the wheel, destroy the brakes etc. )  Also, the unnatural feel from rolling comes from the physics being based purely on rigid bodies.

Some smaller things need adjustments too. For example when you land on your roof and slide on it over a rough surface like gravel. Thats way to smooth... It should tear up your car with parts flying and everything. :)"

dirtgame,3a67mp,handsome_k,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:59:05 2015 UTC,yeah but even with that technique its really fiddly for me for some reason... will turn down sensitivity even more later today and see how it goes  nice edit btw
dirtgame,3a67mp,DeathHaze420,-4,Tue Jun 23 16:07:28 2015 UTC,Yes. I also want soft body physics. And a pony.

dirtgame,3a67mp,dick-van-dyke,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:50:31 2015 UTC,I'm totes for the pony though.
dirtgame,3a8qnt,deadstump,8,Thu Jun 18 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"The game also randomly pops you out of gear, which is fucking annoying."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Annoying_Arsehole,7,Thu Jun 18 06:54:09 2015 UTC,Agreed. I guessit can happen IRL too. But this often? They should change it so that it happens only when your gearbox or whatever is damaged. An undamaged car shouldn't pop out of gear that often. Mine never does and its 20 years old. Although ofcourse I never take it off-roading  :D  Anyone here with real life rallying experience? Is this realitsic?
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Lari-Fari,7,Thu Jun 18 08:57:57 2015 UTC,I found the same on g27. I actually thought I was already using the clutch all this time but realised it was auto clutching the other night. When I turned on the setting to use manual clutch I noticed it's super easy to miss a gear when changing up. I'm going to fiddle with the clutch sensitivity tonight cos I reckon the game wants to see the clutch at 100% before it will let you get a clean engage.
dirtgame,3a8qnt,FlakraT,8,Thu Jun 18 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"The clutch is not very realistic, very arcadey. I would like to see it behave more like a real clutch that a rally car has, for example many times you dont need to use clutch to change gear as you need left foot for braking. Now its very gamey and much too difficult to use compared to real life.."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,gheeDi,8,Thu Jun 18 06:52:55 2015 UTC,"Especially as there is no feedback from the shifter, there is no way to tell whether the gear is engaged or not. You just know that you missed a gear when hitting the trees/rocks/cliffs because you lost your precious engine braking.  Also would be nice to bump start the car using clutch, now it just stops."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,mattijus,3,Thu Jun 18 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although I have learned to react to the acoustic feedback you get when missing a gear. Its really annoying when you crash because of it, as you described. But I guess its realistic.  On the second part i agree!! When going 100+ kph and stalling the engine by braking to hard (or whatever reason) that shouldn't just stop your car. It would be a really nice improvement if they implemented bump starts (is that what its called?) :)"
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Lari-Fari,3,Thu Jun 18 08:55:37 2015 UTC,"I have this probelm with my G27 as well, seems to affect other wheels also"
dirtgame,3a8qnt,subaruwrt,3,Thu Jun 18 06:48:19 2015 UTC,Yeah its not the wheels fault. And its not a bug. Its a feature... ;-)
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Lari-Fari,3,Thu Jun 18 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't happen by the end of the stage, it's completely random. I had gear dropping 2 seconds after the race start. And it's a very old bug, it happened in other codemasters games like grid autosport and dirt 3."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,every-man,3,Thu Jun 18 10:51:26 2015 UTC,The clutch/shifter simulation is one of the weakest parts of this game.  It's the only game where I use auto clutch and sequential shifting.
dirtgame,3a8qnt,ManNotHamburger,2,Thu Jun 18 18:03:30 2015 UTC,That is what I normally use. I just wanted to give myself a little workout.
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Reapercore,2,Thu Jun 18 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"Having the same with my G25, thought the shifter module was going but nope."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,Zheiko,2,Thu Jun 18 09:47:09 2015 UTC,"So, I do believe this has to do with the timing of your shifting. First 20 hours of gameplay, I was loosing gears a lot, like you engage, and 20 seconds later it pops out. I originally thought it was because of bug, but the more I am playing, the less its happening, so I do believe now that its actually about timing of when you release clutch.  I never did any real life rallying, but did some track driving, and I can confirm, that the gears sometimes pop out on high revs when not engaged properly, the problem in games is, that there is no real feedback from the shifter. In real car you do feel when its fully engaged and can feel the difference..."
dirtgame,3a8qnt,_Deh,2,Thu Jun 18 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"They still didn't fixed this, my gears are still popping to neutral when i use clutch+h shifter."
dirtgame,3aa1hg,Murfenator,4,Thu Jun 18 12:30:28 2015 UTC,Isn't that what the saturation does? Less rotation until full lock?
dirtgame,3aa1hg,Lari-Fari,3,Thu Jun 18 12:55:19 2015 UTC,Yes.  But I believe he means as a car setup option for each car.
dirtgame,3aa1hg,djfil007,2,Thu Jun 18 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"Okay. But then, thats what soft lock is for. It sets wheel rotation according to what the car actually has. :)"
dirtgame,3aa1hg,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jun 18 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"But no doubt some of these cars (if not all of them) had adjustable steering lock right? Like steering ratios 13:1, 15:1 etc?"
dirtgame,3aa1hg,Lari-Fari,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:09:15 2015 UTC,Haha OK I See. In the end that would be the saturation setting with certain preset values and a different name at a different place in the menu :-D
dirtgame,3aa1hg,Rudee66,2,Thu Jun 18 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"New FFB is a very good improvement, but I wouldn't call it Excellent."
dirtgame,3a8wll,goode3790,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. Although I must say I'm not sure if I'd like it if the wheel was constantly jerking around and rattlinig as it probably would on rough gravel at high speeds.  I have all those values somewhere around 80. I mean the default is 100. I tried BettaLines setting (shown in his video), but there was hardly any feedback in many situations.  I am not sure why it should be better to decrease those values so much. The effects are there for a reason. Why make them weeker?  My Device settings (G27) have the general FFB at 100 % strength.  Also: Why do you put soft lock on 65 %. Do you know exactly what it does? As far as I know (and I'm not sure) it sets your wheel rotation to the degrees th car would actually have in real life.  So I would say either put it 100 % as you want simulation/immersion, or turn it off, because you want to keep the rotation you're used to... I'm leaving it off for now.  With what rotation lock to lock do you play with? I've got 480° for now. THinking about chainging it to 540°...."
dirtgame,3a8wll,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jun 18 07:11:13 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why it should be better to decrease those values so much.   Different wheels use different tech (motors, gears, belts, etc.), so an input by the game will result in different strength of the forces in different wheels.  Even with the previous implementation, Codemasters recommended setting wheel weight and vibration strength at 50%. The 100% defaults do not mean much, they are not the best valkues. Unfortunately, because it is not easy to get to wheel specific good settings.    Why do you put soft lock on 65 %. Do you know exactly what it does?    This is just the force applied when the wheel is turned to the car specific rotation to prevent further movement. With lower force, it is softer and less hitting a wall with your fist. Restricting rotation to the car equivalent is done by using the soft lock on/off setting."
dirtgame,3a8wll,greatestname,2,Thu Jun 18 07:49:19 2015 UTC,Okay sure that makes sense. Different gear = different settings.  True its hard to find idela settings for each wheel. But the game is still new. We'll see a lot more suggestions for each wheel son I guess.  Concerning soft lock: Okay so I got parts of it right... Thanks! Now it makes sense. But wouldn't a higher setting be better? Because I would want full lock to be felt like its full lock and not be able to turn the wheel further easily. Is there a good reason to make it softer?
dirtgame,3a8wll,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jun 18 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"Because I would want full lock to be felt like its full lock and not be able to turn the wheel further easily. Is there a good reason to make it softer?   A lower setting will still offer enough resistance because the motor strength is still high enough, but it will soften the impact a bit of running against the lock when turning."
dirtgame,3a8wll,greatestname,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:20:43 2015 UTC,Hmm.. okay I see. Thanks for the info. Will test this later :)
dirtgame,3a8wll,Lari-Fari,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:23:56 2015 UTC,i think it will take a while for people to find their optimum settings.maybe its just how you have yours set that makes it feel that way.
dirtgame,3a8wll,dgeesio,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"Ive noticed with the settings lowered you feel more of a difference in the light/medium/heavy. When I tried higher settings it felt like the source of the feedback was from the wheel itself, with lower settings I get the illusion the feedback is from the road and traveling through the wheel. Im not sure how else to explain it, and obviously this is all my personal opinion."
dirtgame,3a8wll,xdeific,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"Make sure your wheel isn't clipping (ie, that the FFB strengths are too strong and causing the wheel to feel dead). If you are around 65 you may be ok, but you may not."
dirtgame,3a8wll,Murfenator,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:31:50 2015 UTC,I definitely got clipping when I tried anything over 75. 65 seems good with the DFGT
dirtgame,3a8wll,xdeific,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:58:49 2015 UTC,"I found the FFB ok, but still slightly weak at 100. How do you know if there is clipping? I have profiler general strength at 100 as well.   65 - 75 seems a little low for me."
dirtgame,3a8wll,Procrastinator_5000,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:29:33 2015 UTC,"If you're not feeling bumps, increase the suspension to 100."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,maestro02,7,Thu Jun 18 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the only way we're going to get any extra info in a straight line with G25s/27s is if we get a custom minimum torque value to adjust accordingly. Otherwise uncustomized settings for 25/27s produce just that, a pretty huge deadzone.  I'm still tweaking, but i've finally settled for ingame settings of 0 wheel/tyre friction - the rest can be left at 100, no real clipping detected - and profiler settings of 0 damper 0 spring. I'm still playing around.   The more I get used to it, the better it gets, and it's definitely better on gravel than it is on tarmac. And honestly, my only criticism so far regarding the centering torque, is that it should be much sharper, kicking in as soon as the car's under slip angle, rather than have a bit of a pronounced on/off range. For us at least."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"hey Looney, I tried your settings from the other thread, but my wheel seems to be zigzagging/moving quickly from left to right when I'm going in a straight line, are you experiencing that?  Btw I have softlock off and logitech g27 profiler is set to 106/0/0/spring off, rotation 540"
dirtgame,3a8nuo,mightystork,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:33:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed that oscillation as well, but it kinda got toned down once i bumped the overall strength down to 100%. Again, that's a minimum friction foible, as in, when the motors aren't producing any real torque, the friction of the entire system is enough to cancel out the effects, which also affects centering forces. Almost any sim on the market without the ability to completely customize the nuts and bolts of the FFB will do that. Even if you turn down the force in game, at rest, it'll be fine, but as soon as you apply any torque to the wheel, it'll start bouncing back and forth. i must stress, a lot of these issues lie with 25/27s and occasionally higher end wheels. Additionally, I'm running 900 degrees and basically letting soft lock do the work.   Btw the other thread is meant as a settings bucket/compilation, so if you come across anything interesting, post it there."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,2,Thu Jun 18 04:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'll try turning the strength down and give that a shot, thanks man"
dirtgame,3a8nuo,mightystork,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"No prob. If you find the bouncing back and forth is still way too much for you, you can only really drop the in-game effect strength some more. Bare in mind (I'll have to stick that into the original thread as well) that I was benchmarking the forces on Monte carlo, where there aren't a whole lot of bumps and such to trigger the FFB in a straight line. Gravel is much better."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"I did not have time to try after update, but I had a similar problem in Assetto with my G25 and bumping up Damper ingame just bit (5%) worked for me."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,ro2pa9,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:01:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about the centering torque. That said, I also tried your settings, lowered saturation to 80%, and set damping and spring effect to 0% in the Logitech profiler (I'll have to investigate what these do) and it feels much improved. Other than the ""deadzone"" and the centering, I'm pretty happy.  Side note, what does ffb clipping feel like? How can you tell if ffb is clipping?"
dirtgame,3a8nuo,ricky_b,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:57:09 2015 UTC,"Basically, FFB clipping is when the motors get too saturated by the number of effects/force that they cannot reproduce any other effects. Example; if self-aligning torque was too strong the FFB would start becoming very numb and you wouldn't be getting any of the bumps and such while the self-aligning torque was acting.   Regarding telling if you're clipping or not, I'm mainly doing it off feel and past reference material. There's no surefire way to do it in Dirt Rally. rFactor 2 for example has an overlay mod which shows you how much your wheel is being used, as soon as the bar goes high enough that it turns red, and stays red (assuming it's not just a large bump), during a turn, that's when it starts clipping. So I basically remember how much torque was coming through the wheel when it was clipping."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:11:56 2015 UTC,I have no idea how you guys are running with the Logitech damper at 0%. I was super unhappy with everything I tried until I turned that back up to 100%. Now I feel like I actually have the appropriate amount of weight in the wheel on gravel.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Jard16,2,Thu Jun 18 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Most of the time that's the problem. That weight you're feeling, is overriding a lot of the effects. It's a bit of a trade-off really. I would love the weight, but then the self-aligning torque is suppressed."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:36:52 2015 UTC,Is the wheel friction setting the way to reduce the weight/damping in-game? I see the limitations of 100% damping now after running the downhill hairpins in Monte Carlo.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Jard16,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"Wheel friction is actually a static effect, tyre friction is dynamic. Wheel friction is doing most of the damping which is killing your self aligning torque.   Also make sure you don't get caught out by a mistake I made during calibration as well. Make sure that when it asks you to turn to full rotation, you hit next WHILE you're at full rotation. I blew through it as a simple left/right calibration. I saw lee mention it, tried it, and it fixed most of my issues."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"After playing around and realizing I made a pretty big blunder with the calibration, I actually revised my settings and I'm thoroughly happy with the FFB. Admittedly, there's still limitations with the logitech wheels, but it's as good as it can get for me."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,LooneyJuice,4,Fri Jun 19 12:51:05 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty much the same way with my G27 @900 deg. Not sure if I was just used to the old FFB or what, but I just ran a couple of events and the FFB didn't make sense to me either. As you said, hardly any feel when driving straight, plus I don't get much wheel centering. To be fair, I've never driven a rally car on the dirt though. :) I'd be interested in trying someone's G27 settings."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,ricky_b,2,Thu Jun 18 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"I am running:  Effects Strength 105, Spring 0, Damper 0, Centering Spring 0, 900 degrees, Allow Game to Adjust  Then self-aligning torque 90, wheel 0, tyre 90, suspension 50, tyre slip 55, collision 65, soft lock 65 and then soft lock ON in advanced wheel settings  On a G27 with 900 degrees. To me it feels amazing, so maybe give that one a try. I should mention that I haven't tried the FFB before the patch."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,grzzzly,3,Thu Jun 18 10:32:58 2015 UTC,Seems that there are many problems with the g27 in particular.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,arronaxx88,2,Thu Jun 18 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on Fanatec here and it's a vast improvement."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,marts30,2,Thu Jun 18 06:55:31 2015 UTC,"DFGT reporting in. Didn't get to try the previous implementation, but this one feels very much natural and predictable. I can even flick (?) the wheel around when going out of corners to get out of opposite lock."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,dick-van-dyke,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:18:00 2015 UTC,"Good old DFGT here too. I think this update was major improvement for this game. Before update I didn't feel where my rear was going, now after update I can join you that flicking is much more natural. I like how these bumps and crests feels now, it's great! Maybe they did this update for DFGT? :D For the record, I drive without assists and keep those wheel settings in 100%."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,puutarhatonttu,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:42:16 2015 UTC,"Another DFGT. Its an entire new game, and vastly better. I think a lot of these issues are people still too used to the old FFB."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,xdeific,5,Thu Jun 18 15:04:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where the hate is coming from, I think people were just too used to the previous implementation.  There are still a few moments that make me question the ffb, but in general I find it a extremely satisfying on my g27 with a full size wheel.  I'm going to have to relearn the game, but that's no surprise given the extent to which it has changed."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Wanderer89,3,Thu Jun 18 05:46:14 2015 UTC,I think this is the biggest thing. People are getting frustrated or getting confused before unlearning all the old FFB. You really need to just practice it out for a while and get your tweaking done and it will start to feel right. But maybe Im biased because I loved it from the start.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,xdeific,2,Thu Jun 18 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm frustrated compared to other sims, not compared to old FFB."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,plaguuuuuu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"To me it feels like the other Sims now. The wheel acts in a predictable manner that im used to. To each his own though, always two sides to a coin"

dirtgame,3a8nuo,xdeific,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:06:36 2015 UTC,this is pretty true. also as i learned don't just dial in other peoples settings.  yesterday i was told use 540 instead of my usual 200. so i kept with my same 200 and adjusted the other factors now it plays amazing.  i would go back to your original logitech settings.then adjust in the vibration settings on off and turn off soft lock.until you find something that works.  self aligning torque is what was doing me in. i just lowered it.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,dgeesio,2,Thu Jun 18 08:33:44 2015 UTC,"I prefer to keep it more realistic when possible re:wheel rotation, I really appreciate the soft lock feature the devs have implemented.  Makes getting a #1 time that much more satisfying. Even modern rally cars only go down to 540, but many group B/A were 900+"

dirtgame,3a8nuo,ErmWhatsMyNameAgain,2,Thu Jun 18 05:20:45 2015 UTC,It could be you just have to get used to it. It took me most of the evening to get back to where I was before the update skill-wise. But now I reall like it and my driving has become more consistent.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jun 18 08:32:33 2015 UTC,"I would recommending setting everything to default, restarting your game and wheel and trying again. When i first tried it, it felt odd to me, but when i restarted the game, after updating my wheel settings, it felt great. From there i went on to tweak it..."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Murfenator,2,Thu Jun 18 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"I still believe the FFB even with the latest improvements, needs some refining. I've seen my car rotating, and the wheel not self correcting, like I expect to happen when I lose control of the rear end. It happens now that it self corrects, which is a good thing, but I've experienced a few bugs in the matrix already if you know what I mean."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,adyrhan,4,Thu Jun 18 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"On dirt tracks, you don't really have a lot of traction, so instead, you are basically fighting the wheel the whole time to maintain your momentum. It sounds like you may be trying to correct yourself when really you should be trying your damnedest to keep the wheel straight or in the direction of where you want to go...which the old FFB helped you to do...and the new one certainly does not.  Between having to forget everything you knew  and learning something the complete opposite, you will probably have a pretty steep learning curve ahead of you.  One thing I did notice though was that it feels like you should regain a lot more traction after releasing that gas than you do...and now the idle slowdown feels far too intense."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Almric,2,Thu Jun 18 04:30:16 2015 UTC,I absolutely hated my G27 @ 900. I turned it down to 540 in the Profiler and it's slightly better but I have remarkably similar feelings as OP.
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Jard16,2,Thu Jun 18 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"i think you guys are too used to the old crappy ffb. i started playing after the ffb update and it feels really good. not perfect ofc, but on dirt it's almost perfect. on the tarmac it's still a bit dead."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Talpaman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:09:25 2015 UTC,Set the overall force from logitech profiler to 105%
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Annoying_Arsehole,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:56:53 2015 UTC,So many 900‘s. How can you guys go around hairpins throwing the wheel all the way around like that? I find that more annoying than getting used to the new ffb
dirtgame,3a8nuo,DeathHaze420,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:15:22 2015 UTC,Because with soft-lock on then its realistic? If soft-lock is right then however much you have to turn it is how much they would have to in real life.

dirtgame,3a8nuo,Ballistica,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:12:57 2015 UTC,yet they nay say the soft body physics
dirtgame,3a8nuo,DeathHaze420,2,Fri Jun 19 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"I agree there, there is certainly lots of progress to be made, but its only early access so plenty of time"
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Ballistica,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that the FFB needs improvements when driving straight, as the wheel does feel dead between 11 and 1 oclock position."
dirtgame,3a8nuo,Rudee66,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:47:09 2015 UTC,I'm playing with the Fanatec CSR ForzaMotorsports wheel at 900 degree rotation with soft lock on and the default settings feel amazing. I can definitely feel the motors doing their job on the straights.
dirtgame,3a8pm1,deadstump,6,Thu Jun 18 02:52:14 2015 UTC,I think it is very sensible to re-center the wheel when  a) resetting (recovering) the car and  b) (re)starting a stage.
dirtgame,3a8pm1,JacksGT,2,Thu Jun 18 09:27:15 2015 UTC,"Ha, same just happened to me...drove wide in a hairpin, recovered and my wheel was still locked left. Would be cool if the wheel re-centered after a recovery!"
dirtgame,3a8pm1,ricky_b,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:08:13 2015 UTC,Please no... just keep track of it.  Or at least make it an option.
dirtgame,3a8pm1,Wanderer89,-3,Thu Jun 18 05:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly that. As much as I hate may driving since the FFB update, the wheel shouldn't center itself on default. My own car in real life never did that and I've never heard of Rally cars being capable of self centering the steering wheel. This is ""DiRT Rally"" not ""DiRT 3""!"
dirtgame,3a8pm1,Kongareddit,7,Thu Jun 18 07:48:11 2015 UTC,"If you drive up to the stage start you would have your wheel centered.  If you had just been pulled out of a ditch by spectators, you would have your wheel centered.  I  don't think that doing this brakes the realism."
dirtgame,3a8pm1,krivjur,2,Thu Jun 18 11:05:52 2015 UTC,"There's also the possibility of auto-reset which can happen by surprise. Not looking forward to full force centering, with strong wheel it'd be more dangerous than useful. I haven't had a problem keeping my wheel pointing at right direction so far. The centering feature would need to be option and with adjustable strength."
dirtgame,3a8pm1,dick-van-dyke,3,Thu Jun 18 13:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, it shouldn't just blindly pull to center, but if it were to just kind of apply some pressure like when you are dealing with camber and you could let it slide to center it would be awesome.  Going from dead wheel in the not driving mode to ffb should have a bit of a transition.    My launch into the bank at the start of the stage was really annoying since I was in my career mode and it really set me back.  I mean maybe they should just let the cars 'drive' up to the start of each stage like they do at the start of each event during which time they could let the wheel find its center."
dirtgame,3a8pm1,Supdawg,4,Thu Jun 18 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure everyone here means that the car should only self-center immediately after pressing Recover, so that after recovering, you start in the straight line and not back into the ditch. It would be silly to self-center the wheel at all times."
dirtgame,3a8pm1,Kongareddit,3,Thu Jun 18 12:57:46 2015 UTC,"Your car also doesn't drive itself to the start line without your input, or teleport back onto the road."
dirtgame,3a8pm1,Lari-Fari,2,Thu Jun 18 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Why are you trampling on the realism?!?  We should have to sit in a line of cars for 45 minutes before every stage watching the cars take off ahead of us at 1-3 minute intervals, and then at the end of the stage drive at the posted speed limit through towns and backroads to get to the next stage!  Anything less than this will totally break my immersion.  /s"

dirtgame,3a8jip,NaughtyEwokCave,2,Thu Jun 18 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"The G27 is a great wheel.  It is more than enough for 99% of sim drivers.  I have had mine for 3 years or so, and regularly drive in iRacing, Assetto Corsa, RBR, and now Dirt Rally, and it has always been a great device.  Hardware won't make you any faster, but if you really get into sim racing and you want something fancier then you can always upgrade and sell the G27 to get someone else into sim racing!"

I bought g25 for $180 and after soo many hours spent with it, I would not hesitate a second to spend double the amount on it again.  You cant go wrong as you get the whole set with clutch and H shifter"
dirtgame,3a6ho5,LooneyJuice,2,Wed Jun 17 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"For what its worth I tweaked betta's settings from his video for my DFGT. I noticed a huge improvement when everything wasnt 100%. Here:   I have my rotaion set to 900 in the logitech Profiler with the saturation at 80% in game (to make 720).  Then it goes as follows:   Self Aligning Torque - 65 Wheel Friction - 55 Tire Friction - 30 Suspension - 65 Tire Slip - 65 Collision - 50 Soft Lock - 65. (Make sure this is turned on)    Im still playing around, but this is what feels the best to me so far."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,xdeific,2,Wed Jun 17 18:37:32 2015 UTC,"Cool! Thanks for posting them, i'll try them out as well."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,Multicheerios,2,Wed Jun 17 18:51:42 2015 UTC,"Well, i checked your settings, and I watched Betta Lines' video again, and Tyre/Wheel friction to 0 did the trick for me. And I know I can run up to 100 on the rest of the effects with the overall effects strength in profiler at 100%, since it doesn't go past what i usually feel when it's clipping with other sims like rFactor 2 and such. Now I can finally tell the difference, and it's pretty huge."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,LeSpank3,2,Wed Jun 17 19:14:07 2015 UTC,"Just a bit of a ""oops"" moment here. The settings i posted previously were before I realized i made a pretty big mistake. I was going through FFB feedback discussions and such, and I saw Lee mention ""you have to press the button while the wheel is at full lock"" during calibration. I, on the other hand, blew through the calibration test assuming it was a typical left/right, next deal. It fixed a lot of my problems. So make sure you're getting that right.  Current settings are:  Profiler:   Overall effects Strength 100% Spring: 0% Damper: 100%   In game effects:   All at 100% besides wheel friction at 0% Adjust strength according to your preference"
dirtgame,3a6ho5,fyiimapizza,2,Thu Jun 18 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"tyvm, those settings work great with me"

dirtgame,3a6ho5,deadstump,2,Mon Jun 22 18:11:14 2015 UTC,After trying a few others I copied your settings and they work perfectly on my G27. Feels a completely different game to pre patch. Love it.
dirtgame,3a6ho5,Manly_Engineering,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:23:24 2015 UTC,"These settings basically helped a lot with counter-steering, but i feel as though the effect should be much sharper. Stronger self aligning torque appears to have no effect on sharpness, and starts causing the FFB to clip and override other effects.   I think the Damper Effect setting in the profiler is causing that, I turned that down to 0% aand the wheel feels much better."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,mckirkus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give that a go as well. I tend to keep stuff on stuff besides rfactor and such, since a lot of games use the canned effects. Will try it out."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,Rudee66,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"Well, apparently it did help a bit even when the wheel friction was on. So thanks for that. I'll keep testing."
dirtgame,3a6ho5,planelander,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a question with the g27.   I went to calibrate my wheel, and the game stops it at 100% before reaching full lock. The g27 goes hard, but there's still 180deg left. So in the next part when it asks you to hold it at 90deg, it comes out to ~540deg, not 900 like it should. Anyone have a fix for this?"
dirtgame,3a5b8i,mmm1kko,7,Wed Jun 17 10:05:09 2015 UTC,Now I just need to figure out good settings for G27. Anyone have any of that good shit yet?
dirtgame,3a5b8i,justbiglee,3,Wed Jun 17 10:34:43 2015 UTC,Try 540 degrees of rotation in your windows settings. Then load the game and run the wheel calibration. (don't forget to hold the wheel at full lock and 90 degrees when pressing a button to continue) and see how you get on with that.   Should be a good base.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Holiace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"I did this, it is now super playable."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,greatestname,0,Sun Jun 21 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"Easier to just calibrate with the default 900 degrees and then set the wheel saturation to 60% (540 deg) and 80% (720deg). This way I don't have to touch the windows settings when changing sims.  G27 is just too cheapo wheel to really run 900 deg in class B cars, 540 and I'm back doing well again.  What I'm trying to figure out how to get most input possible without clipping any of the signal, probably turning stuff down to around 65%."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Francoberry,4,Wed Jun 17 14:49:11 2015 UTC,You can have per game settings for the wheel parameters in the Logitech Profiler.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Francoberry,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:15:42 2015 UTC,For some reason it bugs the hell when I try to use it on steam games.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,every-man,3,Wed Jun 17 15:20:03 2015 UTC,what do you mean when you say 'G27 is just too cheapo wheel to really run 900 deg'?   im not starting an argument - just wondering what about it's quality makes it unsuitable to run a rotation degree that it supports/uses
dirtgame,3a5b8i,justbiglee,4,Wed Jun 17 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"With that kind of rotation in normal car I simply release my grip on the wheel in middle of the turn to let it straighten out and catch it in the correct place, however with g27 I can't get this done accurately. I guess even the small amount of friction between the wheel and my hand with which I'm feeling how fast it rotates fucks it up.  No idea why but I'm having problems with it, perhaps my wheel just has poor motors or something."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,krivjur,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:31:09 2015 UTC,I see what you mean - Gear driven wheels just aren't strong enough in comparison with belt driven
dirtgame,3a5b8i,grzzzly,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:49:08 2015 UTC,Good settings? Does it work right for you? I have G27 and ffb feels inverted.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,plaguuuuuu,5,Wed Jun 17 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"It's not, it was actually wrong before. If you are running a low degrees of rotation in your windows driver (some people seem to be using 200 or 270) try turning it up to 540, run the wheel calibration again and it should start to make more sense."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Emperalhero,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"Hmmh, some effects probably are not all."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Jdfvn,2,Wed Jun 17 12:03:53 2015 UTC,Feels like mechanical trail isn't simulated in FFBEffectSelfAligningTorque and steering lightens up easily turning into corners. If you set the scale to negative in DiRT Rally\forcefeedback\effectsetup_v2.xml then it will feel inverted to me.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,freedomweasel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"Does anybody have profiler settings I can use? Currently I get no FFB at all.  edit:   never mind, I simply used Effects Strength 105, Spring 0, Damper 0, Centering Spring 0, 900 degrees, Allow Game to Adjust  Then self-aligning torque 90, wheel 0, tyre 90, suspension 50, tyre slip 55, collision 65, soft lock 65 and then soft lock ON in advanced wheel settings  Man this game feels good now."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,marts30,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:05:27 2015 UTC,I had to turn self aligning torque way up - like 130 or 140. Running a G25. I'm going to try increasing global FFB from 100 to 120 when I get back from work though.   I could possibly have shagged my G25's motors from too much drifting but Assetto Corsa still works fine so I dunno :P

dirtgame,3a5b8i,xdeific,3,Wed Jun 17 14:30:29 2015 UTC,This feels awesome!  Gonna take a while to get used to the 1:1 steering ratio (900 w/ soft lock enabled)... as I was playing with ~300 (same I used for prior Codemasters games).  But I'm going to stick with the 1:1 setting.  Thanks for listening Codemasters... hopefully this is just the start for all of Codemasters racing series.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,CRAZEDDUCKling,4,Wed Jun 17 16:51:05 2015 UTC,And now that the force feedback makes some sense I can identify that it's in fact backwards. Anyone have any idea how to invert it?
dirtgame,3a5b8i,justbiglee,5,Wed Jun 17 11:11:13 2015 UTC,"Can we confirm it's backwards?  Or is it just backwards relative to what we used to have, which was broken?  It feels good to me on my G25 but maybe that's just because the old way was so horrendous.  I have a hard time believing they'd release it broken even in early access."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,CRAZEDDUCKling,2,Wed Jun 17 12:57:23 2015 UTC,"It feels totally backwards on my G27, I got my brother to play as well and he agreed."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,CRAZEDDUCKling,3,Wed Jun 17 13:09:56 2015 UTC,Feels great on my DFGT.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,SLiiDE101,2,Wed Jun 17 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"It isn't backwards, but you could always change the config files and put the scales on negative to feel what backwards is like.  Have you driven on tarmac yet? Try that because on dirt and sliding you get kinda different feeling."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Peregrine7,2,Wed Jun 17 14:53:13 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. I'll give it a try.  EDIT: Yeah, that seems much better."

dirtgame,3a5b8i,krivjur,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:28:53 2015 UTC,"If there's any ""weight"" or ""dampening"" settings they will affect harsh, quick movements like turning in. I'd go for those first."

dirtgame,3a5b8i,justbiglee,2,Thu Jun 18 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"After having tried the FFB patch, I feel confused. Am I doing something wrong, since I can't seem to drive at my usual pace, I feel like I'm just half throttle (half of normal) all the time and when I need to correct I'm constantly late and flying off the course (when previously I almost never crash)?  Using the G27 and 900 degrees in the Logitech profiler, calibrated in-game and using soft lock, and for instance driving the Subaru I don't feel in control of the car at all. The most difference I feel is in the force feedback which indeed gives more information, but the only difference from the last version that I personally feel is that I have to turn the wheel like a madman to correct now compared to before. To me the difference is like an 80's car without power steering compared to a modern car. Even for small turns in the road, like 6-corners or less, I feel I have to turn the wheel like in a non-power steering car. It's like the deadzone is huge.  I haven't driven rally cars in real life so I don't know what it ""should"" feel like, but right now if no one told me this FFB patch is supposed to be better I would personally have thought this is a bug, the steering feels much looser and I don't feel in control of the car at all. Is it just me that isn't used to ""correct"" steering or are my settings somehow screwed up?"
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Wanderer89,2,Wed Jun 17 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Put the overall effect strength to 105-107% to help eliminating the deadzone, it should also generally stiffen it up somewhat."
dirtgame,3a5b8i,krivjur,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:12:03 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try that.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Talpaman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"Tried it at 106%, and the difference is huge! Interesting that such a small change makes such a big difference. Now I understand what people mean when they talk about the new FFB! I'm getting worse times than before, but I'll chalk that up to getting used to the new steering. It actually feels a lot better now and I feel I can do maneuvers that were impossible before. It's also a lot more fun. Thanks!"
dirtgame,3a5b8i,QuadroMan1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"Other games have a minforce slider to eliminate the deadzone, i've yet to open dirt rally with the new update to see what settings there are.   In my experience with g27 the over 105% make the top end of the forces rather non-linear, so best would be to keep it 100% or so and have a minforce setting to eliminate the deadzone (what it does is boost all the small forces to above the minforce amount so the wheel will be able to produce them like supposed to)"
dirtgame,3a5b8i,Peregrine7,2,Wed Jun 17 19:58:03 2015 UTC,"No minforce, so unless you love a really loose g27 you kinda need to set the force to over 100%."

My wheel (OSW) isn't supported so I can't tune the lock calibration in-game. Had to hack the effectsetup_v2.xml to get rid of friction effects as it was undrivable on default strength. Still need to find suitable  overall force scaling but FFB in countersteering seems much improved.
dirtgame,3a5b8i,GindyTheKid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:00:04 2015 UTC,Its empty for me (g27 user). Perhaps you could fool the devicesetupv2.xml and edit one of the wheels there to be recognized as OSW instead by changing the identifiers?
dirtgame,3a5b8i,SnuifDuif,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:21:06 2015 UTC,"I have had edited devicesetup.xml since beginning to get the wheel working. :) Then overwriting lg_g27.xml preset for axis and button mapping for 3 devices. The game detects my OSW as wheel as far FFB is concerned (effectsetup_v2.xml). but not in terms of menus in functionality. No deadzone, saturation, linearity adjustment in menus, no calibration or h-shifter option.  Edit: So my thinking was that the game could maybe use files in wheelsettings folder despite not offering calib in menu. Have you used in game calibration and still no files there?"

You can still get it working and use profiles in the MMos tool for different steering ranges. I will still need to try tweaking the FFB before judging how good it is now. On first impressions it isn't as detailed or direct as in iRacing or rFactor 2 (or AC but I feel it's step below those two on my small MiGE build).     I was always a bit scared of big oversteer moments in DiRT Rally before the update because the FFB was fighting against me. Now I'm able to use much more strength, but the new FFB feels a bit abrupt on some occasions (primarily using FFBEffectSelfAligningTorque, still need to dial in other options) , maybe the friction and lateral effects are supposedly used to mask that.  Edit: One thing I don't have solid knowledge is what the linearity is set to. It's not in any of the xml configs, so I'm just hoping it's linear by default."

It's very tedious.  There needs to be an ingame way of setting camera and fov for each car before the race."
dirtgame,3a5ysg,every-man,3,Wed Jun 17 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"Second this FOV adjustability with a little elaboration:  We need to be able to specify our physical screen size, distance from eyes to center monitor, angle between center and side monitors, and the ability to render each screen individually.  All of these are critical to achieving a proper perspective from the drivers point of view."
dirtgame,3a5ysg,capnbard,2,Wed Jun 17 16:51:47 2015 UTC,This by far.  I used the Dirt3 camera editor tool that's floating around online to make most of the cars better - but proper FOV is essential for this game to be considered a sim of any sort.  Just some keyboard buttons to move the camera forward/back and up/down will help a ton.
dirtgame,3a5ysg,CaptMatt15,20,Wed Jun 17 15:58:47 2015 UTC,Less forgiving damage.    When I gracefully bin my car into a tree trunk at 100kph I shouldn't be able to continue.  As it is now I can barrel roll through a series of corners and not even crack a windshield.  Damage should affect car handling more as well.  Hitting a rock or log should result in misalignment of the wheels and cause the car to pull left or right.
dirtgame,3a5ysg,capnbard,3,Wed Jun 17 15:40:07 2015 UTC,This! Bring back your awesome damage models Codies!

dirtgame,3a5ysg,ForceInfinity,2,Wed Jun 17 15:03:21 2015 UTC,I don't like the dash cam because the FOV is off and it feels like im driving at 300mph! Id like hands removed and wheel to match mine (or wheel removable too since there isn't any pertinent data on the wheel).
dirtgame,3a5ysg,Murfenator,13,Wed Jun 17 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"A pacenote editor:  I really want to be able to tweak the notes to my heart's desire.  To go along with this I would like a recce mode where you can drive backwards on the stage and have no damage so that I can tweak the notes section by section easier.  What would my pacenote editor look like in my mind?  You would have a bank of calls and when you pause the game you could bring up the editor where there would be a ""light wall"" that you could move up and down the track and then place notes wherever the wall is.  It would behave like a free camera that you could slide up and down the stage.  Then I would like to be able save the notes and choose what notes would be my default for any given car.  Being able to share these notes with people would be awesome too. A test and tune mode: I would like a short circuit for each country with road surface and turns similar to those found on the stages.  I would like the damage turned off.  And I would like to be able to pause the game and tweak the car's settings live so that I can quickly adjust the car's handling to what I want... all while driving on a well known bit of stage. FOV/Camera placement: What it says Adjustable damage levels:  Right now the damage is rather forgiving.  It is nearly impossible to actually DNF due to damage.  I would like to be able to shut it completely off for practice or crank it all the way up to hit a tree and you are done levels.   Loving the game!  Keep up the good work!"
dirtgame,3a5ysg,deadstump,2,Wed Jun 17 18:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yes please on the notes editor! I just got the game in the sale and this is my main frustration. Most of the time the defaults are fine, but the ""early"" call is too early to remember by the time I get to the call. Then there are moments where I hear ""left 5"" right as I enter what I would rather hear called ""left 3 DC"" a half second earlier."
dirtgame,3a5ysg,shark6428,2,Wed Jun 17 23:51:11 2015 UTC,A test and tune mode:   So essentially a shakedown like in real life?

While game language is english, option to choose different co-driver language (add finnish pacenotes! :>) More details about cars to help choose perks. AI on the top is quite well balanced atm but if you don't retire a event it is impossible to be bottom 3 on championship, snapped hand brake cable shouldn't cause 10min time loss on a 4min stage.

As strange as it may sound in this community, consider giving us flashbacks in custom events. Currently, there is no training mode in this game and mastering those hairpins would be less of a frustration with simple rewind option instead of a full restart.

I'm definitely a casual player, I'm using a 360 controller but I find the car very easily hits bumps and I completely lose control. For example at 0:38, 1:05, 2:52, etc. All the bumps after 4:45 would cause my car to spin out of control.  Is this your skill? The car? Or is it the wheel?  I'm genuinely trying to improve and I know playing with a 360 controller isn't that good, but if I hit a bump at speed the car instantly loses control and I have to fight it by twitching left-right-left-right or slowing down until the car stops wobbling. Like what happened to you at 4:22, except at every other bump."
dirtgame,3a6k1d,kinnadian,2,Thu Jun 18 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"I played dirt 1 with a controller, but the wheel does make it easier.  As others have said, rally is about weight balance, even more so than other disciplines of autosport, and many of the moments you list are examples of that.  0:38 I jab right a split-second to put the weight of the car on the left wheels so I can cut across a jump under my right wheels.  1:05 I put the car into a slide just before the jump so I'm pointing the right way when I land, 2:52 is similar to 0:38.  And the stuff after 4:45 is just pucker material no matter what at that speed, lol"
dirtgame,3a6k1d,Wanderer89,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"Bumps are much easier to control with a wheel, as you've got more precise movement and FFB.

Though god damn I love dailying a Miata, I beat the ever living shit out of that car as soon as it's warmed up most days, and don't even break the law! People who complain about body roll and lack of power just don't get it :P  I heel toe damn near every day so that's easy, but the left foot braking is learned from sims, rarely makes sense in my Miata, though when it does it's so satisfying :)  Will say I only got the cockpit together about 2 months ago, so still fine tuning all my ergonomics and debating on upgrading my wheel."

I've been driving this thing on 3 cylinders for almost a year now and it's still going but I feel it's gonna die soon. I never fixed because it's a bad head and the car isn't worth it.   Oh well.

Probably because they optimised it for higher end wheels with belt drives?   Try cranking up the first FFB setting, 'self aligning torque', it does the trick quite well. This turns up those counter steering forces. From the name of the setting I assume it's the FFB calculation derived from slip angle * castor at the front wheels.  I only had a couple of minutes to mess with it before work today though. I'm going to try some other stuff tonight like turning up all FFB globally using the Logitech drivers"

The biggest thing to get used to is if you change the lock from say 400 degrees to 900 like me, there is adjustment required.  Once I got used to the new lock, I was just as fast but have to work the wheel more now due to additional rotation.   The loss of grip on snow/ice now feels amazing.  You really feel the ice.  Also, the tarmac stages suddenly feel drivable.  The old FFB was adding so much confusion that it just felt like the tire model was wrong.  This is fun now.  I used the Codies recommended settings, not Betalines' and it feels just about perfect to me.

If this player didn't bother to spend so much time telling them how to fix their mistake would it have even been fixed as well as it was
dirtgame,3a21c2,thinsoldier,6,Wed Jun 17 06:45:51 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely should never have been an issue but it's still early access and at least they have listened and done something.
dirtgame,3a21c2,MenaiWalker,-5,Wed Jun 17 08:25:25 2015 UTC,"I understand that it's human nature to defend something you spent your hard earned money on (http://techreport.com/blog/21294/the-science-of-fanboyism) but I don't think any of you understand the problem I think I see.  Imagine someone opens a gun store. Brand new business, just starting out, first day open, lots of missing/unfinished stuff. They only have 2 categories of firearms, they only have 1 type of bullet in stock. They have zero accessories. The air conditioning doesn't work inside and the firing range outside doesn't have air conditioning either because it doesn't have a roof yet. The only targets they have are empty beer cans. The instructor of the firing range is pulling triple duty as salesperson, cashier, and gun range instructor.   These are all understandable for a brand new gun store on the first day.  But when a student asks the instructor why his gun won't fire, he looks it over, checks the magazine, the chamber, the hammer... and say ""geez, I don't know what's wrong with this gun!"". He calls a co-worker, that guy can't figure it out either.  The problem with the gun is that the safety is on. He works at a gun store. He supervises target practice. He teaches a class about shooting. But can't tell that the safety is on!  That is what I feel like when a developer with a long history of making car games with support for FFB wheels can't detect with their own in-house skills that there is something horribly wrong with their FFB. There is an endless list of things I would expect to be missing, unfinished, or buggy. But not this."
dirtgame,3a21c2,thinsoldier,3,Wed Jun 17 17:05:26 2015 UTC,I'm far from a fan boy and I'm far from sticking up from them just telling this dude he did a good job in conveying his issues in the game and getting a resolution...
dirtgame,3a21c2,MenaiWalker,2,Wed Jun 17 17:19:07 2015 UTC,You're aware that this game is not completed yet right?
dirtgame,3a21c2,MoederPoeder,2,Wed Jun 17 12:20:33 2015 UTC,"Are you serious!?   Its early access. Inviting someone who made a video about it, was a way to make sure that person will make an updated video showing the improvements. And it worked. All is good."
dirtgame,3a21c2,Lari-Fari,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:39:25 2015 UTC,"Welcome to buying early access games.   Honestly, it would've been a bigger problem if they just said ""hey we'll fix it"" without asking people what specifically they wanted."
dirtgame,3a21c2,IlllIlllI,0,Wed Jun 17 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"Force feedback isn't really an ""opinion"". It's part of the simulation. Sure we can have differing opinions on many nuances of FFB (which is why there are so many adjustable sliders in our wheel drivers) but the main problem described in this video is due to a lack of real world common facts."
dirtgame,3a21c2,thinsoldier,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"Alright, so they mess something (important) up. It's an early access game, they fixed it, and they consulted with the community make sure they get it right. You're mad about this?    I can't believe they needed outside help to fix the issues he demonstrated.   Would you have been happier if they hadn't talked to the guy that made the first video that really brought up the FFB issue?   Here's what it says on the store page:   “It’s really important to us that we make DiRT Rally the best game it can be and we can only do that with your help. Steam Early Access is the perfect place for us to do that. We believe that DiRT Rally is the game many of our fans want and right now, our plan is to develop DiRT Rally with community feedback and get that experience absolutely right.”   I guess it's possible to get riled up about anything, but this really isn't that big of a deal in the end."
dirtgame,3a21c2,IlllIlllI,4,Thu Jun 18 00:19:52 2015 UTC,I think it's awesome that they got an outside opinion. Would you want to put all your trust into one developer?
dirtgame,3a21c2,mightystork,4,Wed Jun 17 08:45:48 2015 UTC,"Really nice, I'm excited for this update. But all this talk of 900° made me selfconscious about my 270° wheel :("
dirtgame,3a21c2,Lunnes,4,Tue Jun 16 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"I was talking about this with Lee - if you're limited to 270 then this FFB update might not deliver the dramatic improvement that I describe in the video. It should still feel better, but with such a short 'throw' between centre and full lock, there is barely enough time for the motor to apply its forces in the right direction before it's telling you the wrong things again..."
dirtgame,3a21c2,Lunnes,6,Tue Jun 16 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, but personnally I can't afford to buy a better wheel right now so I'm sticking with what I have :) What I really enjoy is that the devs listened to the players and adressed one of the major flaws of the game, and tha't promising for the future of this game"
dirtgame,3a21c2,HerpDerpenberg,3,Tue Jun 16 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it. Sure, you might have 540 on a WRC Fiesta, but my rally Civic that I race in real life has a standard 2.75 lock to lock and I installed a 1.5:1 quickener.  So, 2.75/1.5=1.83 turns lock-to-lock or 660°.  I don't see 900° on the Escort as something I'm comfortable with as modern built Escorts of that era likely run a quick rack for 2-1.5 turns lock-to-lock anyway.  I can actually dig up an old Escort rally prep manual and find the spec for the steering rack. 2.5/900° is street sports car steering racks IMO."
dirtgame,3a21c2,mrvile,2,Tue Jun 16 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Real-world rally cars have gradually brought down the standard steering ratio over the decades... Group B ran 900-720 but modern WRC cars run 540. When the FFB update drops, I'll probably try it on 900 to see how it feels but I'm pretty happy with 720 right now. Anything below 540 and I'm super twitchy on tarmac, but lower ratios really do help with the amount of flicking and countersteering necessary in rally."
dirtgame,3a21c2,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're doing a lot of steering corrections and can go from lock-to-lock in the same corner so having a quick ratio rack helps. Fast racks help in road racing as well but you can deal with a 2.5 turns rack, like I had on my WRX STI for track days with no issues.  I had a 1988 VW GTI as my first rally car, with a standard rack, I think that was closer to 3 turns lock-to-lock. I was going hand over hand WAY too much. So, when I built my Civic I made sure to put the 1.5:1 quickener in it and a steering rack oil cooler. I had an option for a 2:1 but I didn't want to overdrive my power steering pump and the stock pumps get cavitation near 8k RPM anyway."

dirtgame,3a21c2,Lari-Fari,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"Could anyone please explain to me what exactly the soft lock setting does? I dont understand the ingame descrition... Does it mean different degrees from lock to lock, depending on what the car would actually have? Thanks for any explanations :)"
dirtgame,3a21c2,Razon,2,Wed Jun 17 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"It allows you to set a high-rotation wheel controller to its maximum, leaving it to the sim to apply the correct rotation depending on what car you choose. The 'soft lock' is a simulated amount of resistance created by running the FFB motor(s) at high strength when you reach the end of the allowed rotation.   The lowest lock of any car in DiRT Rally (at the moment) is 540 degrees. There are several cars at 720, 900 and 1080. If you set your wheel at 540 degrees or lower (or if you have a wheel that doesn't go to high rotation anyway), soft lock doesn't do anything, on any car. If you set it higher than 540, then it will resist turning beyond 540 for the appropriate cars. So for example, if you set a T500RS anywhere between 540 and 1080 and run the Fiesta, and it will always resist rotation at 540."

dirtgame,3a24mp,batistini,16,Tue Jun 16 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"Fantastic. But, as Betta Lines also says, please fix the steering animation (or at least give the option to remove the hands). Especially with a proper FOV adjustment, the cockpit view is so much more natural than driving from the hood."
dirtgame,3a24mp,quadrion,18,Tue Jun 16 17:38:22 2015 UTC,option to remove the hands   ...and wheel.
dirtgame,3a24mp,marts30,11,Tue Jun 16 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, not sure why anyone would want the hands/wheel when using their own wheel, only for replays..."
dirtgame,3a24mp,DeathHaze420,3,Tue Jun 16 17:58:52 2015 UTC,My wheel is set to 270° so my hands move with his hands. Its pretty seamless and I don't even notice it.
dirtgame,3a24mp,najtrows,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"270 degrees sound insane. That would be a very sensitive setting. I tried around 320 and lost control over my car all the time.  If you can have more than 270 on your wheel then i suggest you try it, cars like the Quattro is way more manageable with more degrees because you get more control."
dirtgame,3a24mp,Wyrm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:38:18 2015 UTC,My wheel is only 180 degrees... :(

dirtgame,3a24mp,batistini,4,Wed Jun 17 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be optimal. As far as I know, no Codemasters game has included this feature, so I'm trying not to go overboard with requests....however standard they might be for a racing sim."

dirtgame,3a24mp,LooneyJuice,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"Hey mate, would you mind explaining to me what soft lock does exactly? I think I've got an idea, but the ingame description isn't helping.  What I think: Soft lock on and set to 100 % will match your wheel (input device) rotation lock to lock to the degrees the car would actually have IRL.   But if thats true, BettaLines' description doesn't really make any sense..."
dirtgame,3a24mp,Lari-Fari,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:19:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what soft lock does. Think of the wheel profiler degrees as the ""hard lock"", as in, it can never go past what it's set in the profiler. Assuming you have a wheel with variable rotation, and it's maxed out, the in game option ""soft locks"" your degrees of rotation to whatever the car uses."

dirtgame,3a3cp7,SkitTrick,15,Tue Jun 16 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"So as far as I know this is how it is.   Light Gravel: This is small particulate gravel that packs well and ends up making a rather solid road.  The grip is generally higher than the larger gravel sizes, but it is in Wales so when it gets wet it becomes as slick as dog snot. Medium Gravel:  Doesn't pack as well as light gravel so there is less grip Heavy Gravel:  Kind of big rocks that will roll around and generally not offer much grip, but will be rather bumpy.  So you might want to soften the car up a bit to deal with the bumps."
dirtgame,3a3cp7,deadstump,3,Wed Jun 17 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"To add more about the car setup on this, my understanding is that generally the heavier the gravel, the softer you want the car. The heavier gravel is more uneven so you need a softer setup to keep your tyres in contact with the surface. At the opposite end of the spectrum is tarmac: especially on smooth tarmac like Germany has (mostly at least), stiff car is optimal because it's faster (less body roll) and you don't need to accommodate for a rough surface. Light gravel/compacted snow and medium gravel are on a sort of progression from tarmac to heavy gravel."

dirtgame,3a3cp7,deadstump,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"In rally you have an overly intense relation with different types of dirt. They might not call it light, medium, or heavy, but there is an understanding that not all gravel is created equal. I agree that there could be better descriptions of the surfaces."
dirtgame,3a3cp7,djfil007,3,Wed Jun 17 16:32:49 2015 UTC,i believe it's based on the size of the rocks.  light being small pea gravel... heavy being larger stones.
dirtgame,3a3cp7,MrKnox,3,Tue Jun 16 22:23:34 2015 UTC,I believe the question is more about how that effects the handling of the car. Excellent question.
dirtgame,3a3cp7,MrKnox,7,Wed Jun 17 01:23:59 2015 UTC,It's a poor choice of words. It translates poorly and they're fairly ambiguous. Does heavy mean muddy? rocky? Why not soft and hard? what does medium mean? What the shit is medium gravel?
dirtgame,3a3cp7,najtrows,2,Wed Jun 17 01:38:07 2015 UTC,Agreed!
dirtgame,3a3cp7,greatestname,2,Wed Jun 17 02:37:35 2015 UTC,its about the size of the rocks.. light is a dusty almost sandy finnish/swedish small road in the woods.   heavy is more rocks and shit.. maybe more like some greece and italy stages.

Dirt rally and showdown both are just summer sales, ending on the 20th.  When other games (eg. CSGO) went on flash sale at the same price they had the countdown timer...

A subaru also i dont like so much, even with full diff and 80/20 settings it still doenst swing around like i want it to, sme for the audi  For group B i recommend the Peugeot or the Lancia. Both are a bit of a challenge tho. The rs200 is abit of a tortoise, BUT, it is very agile, stable and predictable, which comes in handy in group B speeds."
dirtgame,39xo2w,Miltrivd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"The Quattro is a bit understeery yes, but it feels like it's on rails, a bit of tunning also helps. It's the Group B car I like the most.  I went for the 205 first, my favorite Group B car, but it's really, REALLY hard with a controller. Seems the short wheel base demands a lot more corrections on the steering input, it will still make you work but should be better with a proper wheel.  The Delta is quite good as well and slides a lot more than the Quattro without being as much work as the 205. Haven't tried the other ones."
dirtgame,39xo2w,docmuppet,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"but it's really, REALLY hard with a controller   Maybe thats why I've been struggling so much! (that said I love driving the 205 anyway)."
dirtgame,39xo2w,Miltrivd,2,Mon Jun 15 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"The Stratos won't be easy either then hahaha, they are both lots of fun but since they require finer throttle and steering input we have a disadvantage with the controller.  Btw, if you go for the 205, lowering the viscosity of the differential, it helps tons to stop it going sideways without return. Main issue is that the car gets grip back after a slide quite violently and whips back to the opposite direction.  Mainly RWD and the 205 have been a bit of a struggle for me with a controller. Everything else goes well :D"
dirtgame,39xo2w,SkitTrick,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"I fucking love the quattro. Its straight-5 engine weights almost as little as a house, it understeers on the way in, but not that much. Once you get used to it you'll be able to predict the braking points and be able to whip it around. It's got tons of power, so the drifting is nice once you get the hang of slamming the throttle and jabbing the E-brake to make it turn hairpins.  Personally, the mid engine cars I'm sure are bullets but don't provide the visceral satisfaction I get from going completely medieval on the controls. This also makes it so the margin of error is a little wider, given it's weight, it tends to stay firmly on the track, just don't overshoot the turn or you'll find out who lives in those little huts at the bottom of the Greek stage."

This results in the inside wheel turning slower than the outside one upon lift-off, transferring weight forward and towards the inside and rotating the car around.  You generally want to play more with rear braking lock, since by increasing the front diff braking lock will result in more vague turn-in since the inside wheel will want to rotate faster due to the higher lock.  ...Hope that made some sense.  *Edited for clarity"

dirtgame,39o83g,Crushker,3,Sun Jun 14 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"Well, regarding the advanced setup, it's very surprisingly complete. The basic setup is just some fairly arbitrary bars as per usual, but upon unlocking the advanced setup the first time, I was kinda shocked by the amount of customization. Basically, everything I wanted to change was there. Power lock, braking lock, torque split, bump, rebound and so on. And the cars respond as expected.  Admittedly though, on a couple of cars some of the suspension settings - namely suspension bump, rebound etc - behaved a little differently. But all in all, even the setup aspect of this game is as surprising as this game's bias towards rallying roots.  P.S. Aside from some rudimentary engineering knowledge, superficial first hand motorsport experience, and a very long-term relationship with sim racing, I'm still a bit of an armchair specialist, so take it with a grain of salt."

Here are the features it should have.   Have similar road features as the host country Be a circut so that you can go round and round to really feel out the car Have damage turned off or at least be able to spawn an undamaged car at will, so that way you aren't tuning around damage Be able to pause the game and bring up the car settings and adjust them live (this is the most important bit)   It is just so time consuming to have to fully load a stage again and again between tunes.  I mean if there was just a way to reset to the before stage setup menu that would be a big improvement so that the whole stage doesn't have to load a fresh.  Kind of like a shakedown, but with a full stage.  But really I want the circuit with live tuning.  As part of this I think that you should be able to control in the quick rallies if you want to run with ""your"" car as it sits or the fully upgraded one, so that you can tune your car over there without the pressures of a championship."

dirtgame,39losr,mmm1kko,12,Fri Jun 12 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Importance of proper FOV.  The game doesn't tell user how to set their FOV properly and how important it is for better gaming. Tell users atleast that if they sit their eyes inches from the screen that large FOV is good while those sitting two feet away might consider 50degree FOV.  Every week I see people on this subreddit complaining that they don't have enough of a feeling of speed, this means that their FOV is smaller than they're used to and so on. For those that feel the game is too fast their FOV is likely too high. Its an issue with human perception, nothing more.  Perhaps modify your FOV slider so that hitting the enter or corresponding button on controller will take your screen size, distance of eyes from screen  and the screen aspect ratio and it will give the user the proper FOV to use. +10 degrees for more comfortable settings is also useful.  Most every simulation has the same problem, new gamers from FPS games are used to FOV's of 85 or even 100 so when they see the default FOV at 60 they automatically increase it without knowing that they're ruining their own experience."
dirtgame,39losr,QuitoPR,3,Fri Jun 12 17:33:22 2015 UTC,A live example of your fov setting as you adjust would be amazing. Also being able to set individual fov for each car would be great.

dirtgame,39losr,Liquid1me,7,Sat Jun 13 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"It feels that the car takes little damage, like it's very hard for a door to fly out, or the spoilers, bumpers, whatever. If I crash at 120km/h straight at a tree I walk away with a broken windshield and minor radiator damage. It doesnt feel quite as satisfying as it did in previous DiRT iterations. For example DiRT 3 vs DiRT Rally.  Parts should bend more, or at least get dislocated, as in fly of. The whole car should get more overall damage. If you guys can make it at least like DiRT 3 levels, I'll be happy!  Also, keep up the great job, this game is stunning and I'm hooked from the minute I ran it first time.

dirtgame,39losr,mmm1kko,2,Sat Jun 13 09:39:40 2015 UTC,"Not the OP either but I agree with previous comments. Personally I'd really love to see a proper hardcore mode where I won't be going anywhere (except maybe hospital) after smashing my car into forest at max speed and also gradual damage to gears etc sounds nice. Basically what was in RBR but possibly even less forgiving.   In general I would also prefer better repair system where I won't fix x % of my tires or something but instead replace individual broken parts. It would be easier to understand that changing a  blown tire will fix it instead of wondering whether or not repairing my tires for 2% will fix it. Of course for parts like the radiator you could have an option to ""fix"" it temporarily to plug leaks if you don't have the time to change it.  Your temporary  fixes could always fail while on a stage though. Dunno if this kind of system would be popular with players but at least I would really like it."
dirtgame,39losr,Wyrm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"You should damage individual gears when you fuck up a shift, also if you don't blip the gas when downshifting it should damage the gears. Individual gears should be able to fail in your gearbox preventing their use if they're abused.  Mostly it feels like the cars receive about 20% of the damage they should receive, however sometimes even touching the gravel at the side of the roads in wales will blow 2 tyres instantly, which is nice if somewhat irritating, as is the fact that the loose looking gravel is solid as a rock. It really should just bog your car down or perhaps spin it due to slowing one side down more than the other."

I still can't use the clutch as the gears constantly won't go in properly, and I have never had this problem in any game ever, so it isn't just me. :)  Suggestions: In a multiplayer game I'd love the possibility to follow inside my friends car on the passenger seat, so I could look at his driving style and be with him on his adventurous drive. In extension this could maybe include a way to set up notes in game that only the codriver can see, and this could be as simple as picking from icons on screen representing all different varieties of information. And when driving the stage, the codriver can either have these rows of information steadily scrolling at an adjustable pace on screen, OR they can be rendered directly on the pace note papers he has in his hands, and be able to switch pages. This would be such a cool feature, and truly unique too!  I would LOVE an odometer to see how much I've driven any car. It deepens the connection with each car and would be such a nice addition!  A minimal HUD alternative with just shift lights in the center top (or bottom) of the screen and gear number in the corner would be nice.  Also make each part of the UI separate to toggle.   Even if this isn't really realistic, me and some friends would still absolutely love to be able to run gated starts with custom time between starts. For example we'd like to go balls to the walls in a catchup game on an intoxicated wild ride through forests, with just a two second head start or something as stupid as that. :D  Praise: I absolutely love this game to bits!

Otherwise, love the game. Maybe a bit tuning down the wedge hit-boxes on mountain walls and a bit down tune to the strenght of the small bushes on Greece. Maybe it's the gravity.

Let go of the handbrake and the gas pedal at halfway the curve when you think you have just the right speed to make it to the outside of the exit. Quick Shift down at this point to 1st gear and throttle your gas pedal again. Accelerate the curve, keep steering, right amount of throttle. When in trouble you have to manage both throttle and brake sometime some quick handbrake clicks, for just tiny bits whilst keeping your speed up. When your revs go down to idle or your rear wheels don't spin, you've done something wrong, prob when entering the curve in second with too little throttle and at the same time too little handbrake. I do this with soft springs and stronger roll bars."

If it's raining, I change to 1366x768 instead of keeping it in 1920x1080, just to keep the same frame rate.

Sometimes the keys are revoked like it happened with Sniper Elite 3 or Far Cry 4 players.

dirtgame,39gp2k,deadstump,3,Thu Jun 11 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"You know, I might switch to driving with the hood view (I usually drive dash view).  My computer bonks when I have to drive in the rain (I think because of the windshield effects), and hey, now there is no windshield.  As to the HUD.  I think that it is silly to have it off.  In a real car you can just glance down at your gauges and see your revs/speed, but in the game you are fixed to your view so you can't (unless you have a sweet VR headset).  I mean I guess you could use the ""head"" view (so you could actually see the tachometer, but if you have a wheel it is a bizarre feeling.  It is like you are sitting in the back seat with 6 foot arms, and you also see another set of arms and wheel when I have my own.  In a real rally car there is a rally computer (a fancy trip odometer (count up and down) with a clock), so I would know how far into the stage I am and how much farther to go... so again since I cannot ask my codriver or look over at it just because of the locked view."
dirtgame,39gp2k,Lryder2k6,2,Thu Jun 11 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Lowering the FOV definitely helps with the feeling of sitting in the backseat with massive arms.  I run 65 degrees FOV in iRacing on a single 24 inch monitor (which might be considered high to some but is probably average).  In Dirt Rally if you lower the FOV almost to the minimum, it seems about equivalent.  When I'm in cockpit I pretty much just see the hands on the wheel and the wheel itself, which are mostly obscured by my actual wheel anyway.  The main problem is seeing the rev counter without the HUD.  In some cars I can't see the instrument cluster because it's obscured by my actual wheel but in other cars it works out OK.  My main gripe with the HUD is that it seems very unrealistic to have icons popping up on the screen that correspond the route notes.  I'd like to do some rallying in real life eventually, so it seems like a good idea to be used to getting route notes through audio only.  It would be cool to be able to select which elements of the HUD are active.  I'd like to be able to have the rev counter without the other stuff."
dirtgame,39gp2k,deadstump,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:43:45 2015 UTC,You can turn individual pieces of the HUD off under the settings menu. Mine only shows the revs and distance bar.  I wish that we could just have a count up/down odometer rather than the bar.

When I get a VR headset I'll probably move to cockpit obviously, but I can't ""feel"" where the tires of the car are in cockpit/dash cam,  even with triple displays.  It's not as bad as 3rd person, but bad."

dirtgame,39fo21,DeathHaze420,2,Fri Jun 12 14:25:10 2015 UTC,I notice the sense of speed is much higher when using the bonnet cam instead of the in car cam. I only wish that it still had in car sound and the wipers / windscreen effects.

dirtgame,39fo21,SurvivorHarrington,2,Thu Jun 11 16:08:39 2015 UTC,Sounds like you've probably got too wide FOV. The fov calculator linked in this thread actually told me to go to 50 instead of 60 but I found it uncomfortable.

dirtgame,39f3c1,Crushker,2,Thu Jun 11 08:54:39 2015 UTC,I really think I would indeed enjoy the game (even) much more if I just tried to continue the run and just finish. Now I feel I just learn to find the tricky parts in the track and I finish higher.
dirtgame,39f3c1,ruddymccock,3,Thu Jun 11 09:16:07 2015 UTC,Surely by retrying and doing it over and over again you're going to get better rather than doing one bad run? Then you won't need to restart anymore
dirtgame,39f3c1,SurvivorHarrington,3,Thu Jun 11 10:25:03 2015 UTC,That's definitely true but for me this just feels like way too much of a 'gamey' approach. I really like the immersion factor of a sim game and the ability the magically restart feels like such a disconnect from a real driving experience and out of sync with the rest of the simulation. I realise this is probably quite a niche view point though.
dirtgame,39f3c1,ruddymccock,2,Thu Jun 11 12:10:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I agree, I just don't have the temperament to do that! If I make a mistake I just start to rage and do a restart, so kudos to you for being a stronger man than I"
dirtgame,39f3c1,scottyholden,3,Thu Jun 11 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"I retry so often, that I think I've developed OCD.

I've only ever finished the Weekly online challenge without a restart.   Which was like 6 sprint races, and I did it once, all in one sitting.  I've never gotten the ""no restart bonus"".   But I'm really good up to the second checkpoint of every track now.  Like REALLY good."
dirtgame,39f3c1,mightystork,2,Thu Jun 11 15:19:20 2015 UTC,I stay away from restarts if the car isn't upgraded. Basically I accept that I'm screwed and will have to play through the championship again to reach the next class. Also I don't push the car to its limits if I learn the track without upgrades. I've made it all the way to masters doing this.
dirtgame,39f3c1,dgeesio,2,Thu Jun 11 10:59:06 2015 UTC,i like to try to do as fast as possible so often i do restart as im just not satisfied with avg times.
dirtgame,39f3c1,DeathHaze420,2,Thu Jun 11 11:28:16 2015 UTC,The way I see it is that retries are the poor mans rewind. And I hate rewind in racing games.
dirtgame,39f3c1,supervin,2,Thu Jun 11 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"I try not to restart, especially in masters where each event is 12 stages, I can end up spending way over an hour just on one event if I restart all the time.

dirtgame,39f3c1,SurvivorHarrington,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"It's just way too tempting with the penalties being so minimal! I would also love a mode which forces no restarting as I find the method of self discipline to be ineffective and less rewarding than a proper mode.  I often start a rally with intensions of no restarting but it usually seems to go out the window by the second or third stage, then I go fuck it I'm having that (usually second) spot and start spamming restarts until I'm swimming in money and self pity."
dirtgame,39f3c1,Annoying_Arsehole,4,Thu Jun 11 11:58:33 2015 UTC,"Just ask a friend to sit beside you and choke him every time the co-driver makes a bad call on corner, this should help with the frustration."
dirtgame,39f3c1,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"Normally I wouldn't retry but in current circumstances I do if one of three things are an issue:   I'm using a wireless gamepad and occasionally I have issues with it. Basically situations where if I was at home with my wheel, there would have been zero chance of the same crash happening. I'm talking about a lagged input or something that results in driving off a cliff. Doesn't happen very often but it does. Occasionally I've had the screen freeze for a second, sending me off a cliff. Restart.   3.Bugs. It's early access, it's to be expected. Co driver bugging out is the big one, only can be solved with a restart.  That all being said, when these things aren't an issue (hopefully by the time the game releases) and I'm at home with my wheel, I'd love to play in an ultra-hardcore no restarts at all mode. They can do it for the online events so no reason it can't happen in career mode."
dirtgame,39f3c1,deadstump,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"I really try never to restart... but sometimes I just am not strong enough.  The times I do restart it is almost always due to getting a flat early on while driving a long stage.  If there was an option to stop and change the wheel with a time penalty I would do it.  However if I am just practicing in a free rally (or whatever that mode is called), I will restart for the most minor off if I am in that kind of all or nothing mode."

dirtgame,39faid,ExpletiveBanana,3,Thu Jun 11 09:42:50 2015 UTC,"In part, that's due to the stage being a lot less rough than in real life.

There are surprising amount of people who got it for their PS3, drove like 5 hours and put it in storage.  EDIT: the only differences seem to be increased cost, stick as an addon, DFGT button layout (somewhat better in my opinion than the g27 layout), non-linear brake spring. They also claim a new and better optical decoder ring but who knows before its really launched. Still you can go to your local hardware shop and buy the springs for your pedals."

Basically these notes need to be edited or maybe have some extra ""caution/double caution"" phrases added. I can see this being solved in one of two ways:  1) (simple way): have some specific reddit thread or forum for people to suggest pace note changes, accompanied with gifs/video of how it is currently and suggested improvements. I think reddit would be good for this because people can upvote/down vote what they agree with or not.   2) (complex but cool way) add a ""recce""  feature where you can drive along, maybe speed limited, and edit pace notes as you go (change corner type, add caution etc).

I'd like to see it broken down in to levels you choose at the start of each rally, with an option to choose no restarts which gives a significant boost to $ rewards like x5 for example.  3) Register DNF for all forms of quitting out during a stage  4) Let the co-driver turn the page  5) adjust the clutch functionality - the amount you need the press it in and add audio feedback"

dirtgame,39bq9p,SurvivorHarrington,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:51:20 2015 UTC,Just a question about the twitter dirt league mentioned. It says it's an ironman style with no services or restarts. Would quiting/crashing out during a stage allow you to repeat the stage when you come back? If this is how it works it really hurts the whole experience. We really must have a DNF registered if a stage is not completed for any reason (even computer crash) otherwise exploiters will win every time.

dirtgame,39avq3,zondape,9,Wed Jun 10 14:36:18 2015 UTC,General rule of thumb is to soften the front and tighten the back.    Also you can try moving your brake bias a bit more to the front.  Also the center differential could be adjusted to put more power to the rear.  The roll bars are always a good place to start (soft front stiff rear).  Good luck.

dirtgame,39c74h,willi_werkel,2,Wed Jun 10 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of rally cars have mad amount of torque at low RPMs, so it may not be necessary to keep those revs pegged all the time.  But this varies widely from car to car and you still have to find each cars happy rev range (somewhere to redline).  Rally requires some slightly different than traditional racing driving techniques.  One of those is braking in the corners (Left Foot Braking = LFB).  You will be on both the gas and brake at the same time... Actually I have written most of what I am about to tell you before in a wiki entry.  Here is a link to it, please let me know if any of this information was helpful since it is a work in progress.  There was also a video posted here not long ago that went over some rally 101 stuff that was really worth a watch.  I would link to it, but I cannot seem to find it right off the bat."
dirtgame,39c74h,deadstump,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"I have that video on my watch later list, I will watch it soon. Your guide is good to begin with, but I think there is still so much to write (but I know you cant cover everything. Also, what about using the handbrake? Are there situations where it makes sense to use it?"
dirtgame,39c74h,Annoying_Arsehole,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Handbrake in very tight hairpins to get the car turned around on a dime, just blip it to get the rear loose and then counter steer to end the slide.   Here you kinda want to use a clutch to downshift to 2nd gear while braking hard and keep the revs up at the same time so you can power out of the slide quickly.  I'd forget traditional track sim stuff, you don't wanna try to hit the apex perfectly in any blind corners you don't know perfectly and learning the runs is far more difficult. Instead turn before the corner to get the increased grip given by the sidewalls of the 4 wheels being on different lines and then use brake (tighten) and throttle (open) the radius. When you've done most of the actual turning before the corner its easier to do small adjustments, if you instead try to do it track sim style without sliding and take a poor line to a corner you're often fucked.  No idea how to get that done on a pad though. I guess you can do quite fine and accurate steering with it if you're used to playing FPS's etc. on one, me if I'm handed one steer as well on the analog stick as with the d-pad."
dirtgame,39c74h,dgeesio,2,Wed Jun 10 21:38:29 2015 UTC,it all depends on your cars u using and how you drive. the first key thing is learning the map/tracks. so you know what is coming without thinking hearing what is next.
dirtgame,39c74h,deadstump,2,Thu Jun 11 08:48:07 2015 UTC,"I will go over the shifting.  People rev to the moon because generally speaking redline is where your car is making peak horsepower, so staying as close as you can to that means you have the most power on tap at any given moment.  This is a lot more important in cars with a narrow powerband.  What is a powerband?  So internal combustion motors have two important ""places"" on their power band.  One is the max horsepower, and like I said this usually occurs at or near redline (as I said above).  And the other is peak torque, this occurs almost always lower in the revs.  The distance between these two points is the ""powerband"", and you want to keep your revs in this range as much as possible.    A lot of normal high performance racecars tend to have a rather narrow (or peaky) powerband because they value max power over driveability (the cars just kind of fall on their face if you get away from redline), and they can get away with this because they can adjust their gearing to match a racetrack so that they will have a gear that is appropriate for every corner.  Rally cars obviously have to deal with a bit more inconsistency, so having a wide powerband become a lot more important since hitting a bump a little funny might pitch you more sideways than you wanted and scrub some speed... it would be a bummer to have to drop a gear every time just to deal with every little mistake.  So long story short.  Redline is the end of your powerband and where you have the most power and since Codemasters doesn't give us the peak torque rev spot in the car info (it should if any of you CM guys are reading), so by staying on redline you can be sure that you are on the powerband.  The downside is that just beyond redline the power and torque drop sharply, so don't just rev to the moon for no reason."

Did a few 'trail runs' (correct name escapes me) of a race earlier and was thinking stupid game that corner is at most a 3 not a 4. Then when I did the race it called it as 3. This was on one of the Greek stages.  More than once I have flown off that corner in the video, coming from the other direction after it being called a 4."
dirtgame,398w8e,CalmDownJennifer,2,Wed Jun 10 12:54:51 2015 UTC,"In the other direction I think it should be a ""square right"" or ""right 2"" (maaaaaybe 3) at most. It's definitely not a right 4."

dirtgame,398w8e,Lryder2k6,3,Wed Jun 10 09:15:35 2015 UTC,That 4 right caution to finish in some of the Grecian stages has to be one of if not the worst note in the game.
dirtgame,398w8e,dpsogood,2,Wed Jun 10 20:29:36 2015 UTC,Ohhh Grecian.  I like that word.  Much cooler than those 'Greek stages'.
dirtgame,398w8e,dpsogood,2,Wed Jun 10 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think they should through in some errors and some of the co pilot going oh shit I'm lost in the notes. To keep it real! On some real levels, the notes could be tweaked a bit to be a bit more accurate."
dirtgame,398w8e,mess8,5,Wed Jun 10 13:52:12 2015 UTC,"I get that bad notes happen in real rally, and that the co-driver can get lost, but in real rally you can also tweak your notes for future reference.  Also I have mixed feelings on intentional codriver errors, there is a thin line between realism and intentionally being a bastard.  I think I could be down with ""oh no I lost my place!  Give me a moment"", but intentionally bad calls seems a bridge too far.  Maybe it could add another layer to the team management where you could upgrade your codriver, but then it would punish new players.  I don't know.  My gut tells me that for this issue, realism be damned, the codriver should be solid all the time.  I mean it would be more realistic to have electrical faults or random mechanical breakdowns, but I don't think that those have a place in this game.  In my opinion... obviously."
dirtgame,398w8e,mess8,4,Wed Jun 10 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"As a game it should be dialled I agree. In my co-driving experience, I haven't been at fault for a crash yet. I get lost sometimes, we label left corners as rights sometimes and forget to call some important things.  In a real rally, what can you do. In a game I can see how it would get people rage quitting a lot.  One feature I would like to see if a repeat the last note on a quick button."
dirtgame,398w8e,T_WRX,3,Wed Jun 10 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"That would be a cool feature.  I also would like it if the notes were a bit more speed sensitive.  For instance the call after a hairpin shouldn't be called until after the hairpin since you will be going very slowly and you are busy working your way around the hairpin.  Also on fast sections the notes should be pushed out earlier since you will be arriving at them sooner.    Along the pacenote wish list, I would also like really slow turns after a fast section to be repeated when you are just about on top of them and a final reminder that ""yes, this is a hairpin left... LEFT!... not right."".  Also if after a spin or reset the codriver would repeat the few notes that are ahead of you that they may have already read.  Yea, in a game nothing that directly affects the player should be out of the player's control.  Random events should throw a hiccup not a monkey wrench."

dirtgame,395bne,Razon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"Can I report a bug here? Posted in the steam forums, not sure if it's read.  Game not saving:   I haven't tinkered with the XML files, tried disabling steam cloud and verifying files, nothing helped so far. If I retire an event (in this example greece) the next one will probably save fine, but the issue always comes back after a while (and I have to A - retire B - complete all stages in one sitting), and I haven't noticed a pattern to it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_gUJCCyvk  Update: Today I decided to retire greece and sucked up a 16th place, I moved on to Monte Carlo, finished one stage, loaded next, decided to save and quit the game. I started the game again, I'm back at greece with 0/12 progress.   I've given up championship, it's a roll of a dice if I lose my saves or not, I'll just ignore it completely for now.  Update 12.6:  Things I've also tried: reinstalling steam, moving it to another HDD, still the same. It seems that the game does not overwrite the save game files sometimes (located in userdata/...../remote/) when I press the Save button ingame. I'm constantly losing progress now, back to 0 completed stages in the current event every time I restart the game. What else can I test?  I am watching what the files do, it always saves when I first load stage 1, but never after that, doesn't matter at what point I press SAVE.  Update 13.6:  Played a few stages on my notebook, saved without issues. Moved back to my PC, can continue from the last completed stage on my notebook (steam cloud), it saves once when I load the first championship stage (saves all 4 files, 2 normal and 2 backup), but never after that. When I save & quit a stage from championship (it does nothing), I can't connect to the online mode, it says Racenet is not available. However, when I restart the game it works fine. Is there something wrong with my PC? No such issue on my notebook, I even backed up my DR files from the notebook and installed it on my PC again, no luck."

I drive manual with clutch and H-box.  You really don't use 1st gear except for getting wheels to spin in uphill hair pins. Driving impreza I use 2nd gear for 1's, 3rd for 2's. 4th for 3's and 5th for the rest. Consider shifting strategy so that you don't shift when its not really needed, no need to stay always in optimal revs and lose time shifting."

dirtgame,38y26v,deadstump,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"This actually seems like a decent system. I usually go with 2nd for hairpins/1s, 3rd for 2-3s, and then kinda just feel out the rest depending on car/track."

dirtgame,38wdgk,justbiglee,2,Sun Jun 7 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"The winning AI car regardless of difficulty will have same time, however the time differences of other positions increase in easier difficulties.   For example if you're 10 seconds behind you'll place 3rd in open and 6th-8th in master on the shorter stages.  So if you're a consistent driver with 2nd and 3rd places on open and other easier difficulties you often still win the championship by points without winning a single event. On master while I've won a few stages the times are so closely grouped together that a single mistake really drops your position big time. Usually I finish the championships in 4th place by finishing the rallies in either 5th or 6th.  Perhaps increase the fastest AI time around 5 seconds per difficulty so a  semi competent player will be winning in open quite consistently.   The master difficulty is okay in my opinion, though I'd like to see the AI drivers spread out a bit more time wise. I don't expect to win more than 10% of the stages with only 20 hours played so far on the hardest difficulty in a game so I'd say its okay.   Consider adding an insane difficulty for those who can drive balls to the wall perfectly (see daily event winning times) to give the really fantastic people other AI that challenges them."
dirtgame,38wdgk,Annoying_Arsehole,12,Sun Jun 7 22:05:38 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The difficulty levels are messed up.  What is the point of having them if they are going to be so badly applied?  I mean I am fairly often in the top tier of competitors when I run the daily, and I have never won a stage (I did win one hill climb event) let alone a rally.  I have progressed up to Professional so far mostly through the inconsistency of the top of the leaderboard rally to rally (but not in any given rally, there they are more or less rock solid).    Long story short.  At the lower difficulties a moderately skilled driver should wipe the floor with the AI... Otherwise what is the point of having difficulty levels?"
dirtgame,38wdgk,deadstump,2,Sun Jun 7 12:40:25 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I've resorted to using a spreadsheet to track personal progression because the AI in Career is all over the place.

On tarmac, you generally want to keep all wheels planted, but offroad you'll want to be left foot braking to help force and modulate oversteer. Once I got used to it, my driving in Dirt Rally improved tremendously."

dirtgame,38vss9,AllezCannes,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:42:29 2015 UTC,http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel-and-toe
dirtgame,38vss9,mrvile,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Heel-and-toe:       Heel-and-toe shifting  is a driving technique used mostly in performance driving,  although some drivers use it on the road in everyday conditions in the interest of effectiveness. It involves operating the throttle and brake pedals simultaneously with the right foot, while facilitating normal activation of the clutch with the left foot. It is used when braking and downshifting simultaneously (prior to entering a turn), and allows the driver to ""blip"" the throttle to raise the engine speed and smoothly engage the lower gear.

I know some of the big sim racing channels on youtube exclusively race in just socks too, so you're not alone.  Maybe it's because I roll my foot over for heel toe and instead of actually... using my heel and toes..  (How I learned in my miata since there's not much room for my clompers down there).  Does kinda get annoying having to replace shoes so often tearing up the right side of my right shoe every time I do it :P"
dirtgame,38vss9,Wanderer89,2,Sun Jun 7 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"I personally have a G27, the pedals are known to be very light. I've tried driving with shoes, but they are just too heavy to throttle and brake accurately, I can't quite feel how much pressure I'm applying to the pedals through shoes. However, I've read that with higher-end pedals (or G27 modded with stronger springs) which require much more weight on the pedals, shoes work better.  Likewise, driving a real car in socks is super awkward to me.  On another note, I always thought ""heel-toe"" was just an easier way to refer to it, but the action itself was traditionally just using the left and right sides of the foot. Especially considering the pedal size and placement on the G27."

So instead of buying one 40k perk I spent 20+40+20 to get back to what I had before.  Technically I don't love the 200 ""are you sure?""

dirtgame,38t830,vmaxmuffin,6,Sat Jun 6 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, left foot braking as it's known, fellow redditor's guide goes over it a little: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WlBntwsOdA  Half of it is steering the car, just manipulating throttle/brake to rotate it a little, and part of it is sometimes you need to brake, but want to keep the engine in its powerband."

dirtgame,38x288,hamzta09,8,Sun Jun 7 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"100% disagree. Sense of speed feels fine, coming from someone who's done some tarmac hillclimbs IRL. I think many racing games (particularly those that aren't hard core sims) give a sense of speed that is way too high, because people are playing for fun not realism and want to feel like they're going fast. Also, I haven't played Dirt 2/3 in a while but IIRC the speeds were unrealistically fast, due to wide stages and the physics. So of course they'd feel faster."
dirtgame,38x288,vmaxmuffin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Comparing Dirt Rally to supermegawide Dirt 2, Dirt 2 felt way faster. Not to mention Shift, still best sense of speed to date in a modern racing game."

dirtgame,38x288,JacksGT,2,Tue Jun 16 22:26:46 2015 UTC,Disagree.   I think it sometimes feels too fast  when comparing it to POV cams in wrc.  I think someone even posted a side by side comparison which showed that the game speeds were actually faster than real life.
dirtgame,38x288,Fugaku,2,Sun Jun 7 19:10:08 2015 UTC,"Don't compare it to POV cams. They are SO, SO wrong. Because they're FOV view is (as with almost any camera) way too small.

Thats when it hit me, DR's FFB is a joke compared to what it could be like. I'm probably not the best person to try to explain the difference, but it's painfully noticeable."
dirtgame,38oiuw,xLarkins,5,Fri Jun 5 18:42:37 2015 UTC,Haven't played AC but I have similar feelings when I play rFactor2 or iRacing. There is just so much road feel that you don't get from other games.  The other day I was going over a bump in Rfactor and I could actually feel the bump transition from my left front to the right front just from the feel of the FFB.  I do not get that from games like pCars.

dirtgame,38oiuw,Snouties,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"(this feels like any other game to me, DFGT wheel)   What other games have you played with your wheel? You need to spend some time with games that are known for excellent FFB, like Assetto Corsa or iRacing, and you'll notice that you become more dependent on driving through what you feel in the wheel. When you go back to something like Dirt Rally or Project Cars, it pretty much feels stunted. The feedback is simpler, and because of this, doesn't convey the tactile elements of weight transfer and countersteering that you've come to expect."

Codemasters subsequently reached out to him for more feedback. Very unique and refreshing to see in any development community.  video in question

dirtgame,38oiuw,najtrows,8,Fri Jun 5 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know who Betta Lines is.  What was wrong with the force feedback was that it was not very informative and sometimes gave information that was wrong.  A good example of this is countersteering.  In real life you can feel the point at which your car begins to transition from sliding to to tracking through the wheel, in DiRT it doesn't and this leads to having to rely on visual cues and if you miss them you end up in a big ol' tank slapper (that swerving thing).  Also bumps are not really felt through the wheel.  Good FFB really makes driving with a wheel so much more enjoyable because it is using 3 of your senses (sight, hearing, and touch) rather than just two.  With bad FFB it is like driving with blurry glasses or earmuffs on.  Sure you can do it, but it is so much better without them."
dirtgame,38oiuw,deadstump,7,Fri Jun 5 20:22:06 2015 UTC,Betta Lines was first to make a video about what actually was wrong with the ffb (in technical terms) i think and him living in UK he got invited to codemaster HQ to test it out once they got it ready.

dirtgame,38odt5,justbiglee,12,Fri Jun 5 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"I have been in since the start, it has been good I am in a league and it works well.  I haven't gotten too deep into the setup, but it would be nice to be able to set up a series and be able to fill out the series as you go (like a day in advance of the start of the next round).  It doesn't seem like I can do that very well yet.  Also I would really like it if there was a better way to scroll through the results.  Right now only being able to see 10 at a time without being able to skip through the table is annoying.  It would be nice to be able to either be able to skip through or download it as an excel file or something. I read the road books and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Keep up the good work. Patch drama is fine.  I mean it would be better if it didn't happen, but it is early access and shit happens.   Other Things   HUD settings:  I would like some more HUD options.  I know that a lot of people like to run with no HUD for the 'real' experience, but I have a little bit of an issue with that since a lot of the data removed is available to the driver of real cars, but I simply cannot fit it all on my screen (examples: Tachometer, Speedometer, Distance, and Time).  All of these things are in more or less every rally car and available to the driver if they ask their codriver. More HUD:  I would like a rally computer type odometer output with a count up/down with the stage distance. Stage Info:  I would like to know the stage mileage, my previous best times, etc. Maybe as an additional screen. Car Info: I would like to have a little bio sheet for each car that tells me more information about the car.  Where was it made, max torque @ revs, max horsepower @ revs, turbo, drivetrain, a bit of rally heritage, etc. Menus: If backing out of a menu is going to undo whatever work you have been doing like setting up a rally, a dialogue box should pop up to make sure that you want to do that. Ready Notification: I have a slow computer and waiting for that ready button to popup takes a while.  It would be nice if there was an auditory cue. Pacenote Editor:  There are some calls that I really don't agree with and think they should be different, please let me change them. Auto Recovery:  Please let us shut it off and only save us when we call. FFB:  Yea I know you are working on it. Damage:  Please add various damage levels for either no damage for testing/playing around to realistic damage for us masochists.   Edit:  A couple of things that came to mind over lunch   Being able to make a default setting for each country/car combo so that you will not forget to launch with your prefered setup! Better Camera Control:  I would like to be able to set where my head is and my FOV.  For instance, the Stratos while one of the sexiest cars ever made is completely undriveable for me in the game because of the camera positions.  I normally drive with the dash cam, but with the Stratos I am looking through the very bottom of the windshield and if it is raining my view is almost completely below where the windshield wiper stops (can't see shit), then if I drop back to the 'head' cam it feels like I am driving from the back seat with extendable arms (I have a wheel rig, so I have my own wheel and arms to look at).  Really all I would need to do is in the dash view move my 'head' up half a foot or so (~15cm+ for you Metric folk) and it would be awesome. Names On Window:  Could we get our names and flag on the window stickers? Test And Tune: A live test and tune circuit track for each country would be awesome!  Features it should have is that damage should be shut off or at least a new car should be able to be spawned at will, and we should be able to pause the game and adjust the car's settings live.  This way we could go round and round this track with similar surface qualities, turns, and obstacles as found on the country's stages and tweak our setups quickly.  I know EA made NFS, but I remember that we could do this in Underground 2.   I love what you are doing.  Keep it up!  I am sure that I have more ideas, but I am dry for right now."

I read the road book every time it's posted. I think it's interesting. I wouldn't mind seeing the devs playing the game or perhaps inviting some IRL rally drivers to show us how it's done.  Seems to me that you handled it really well and resolved the issue rather quickly. Well done!

I would have liked a bit of info on the ETA between the ""we know what the problem is"" and the ""it's fixed, you can go race now"", a minor request.

Kinda like it is in-game where you can quickly check ""okay I'm ranked 4th here, on place 26 in that league"" etc. Different icons for Keyboard/Controller/Wheel users in leaderboards Pikes Peak, the ""sunset"" weather setting is too bloomy for me, makes my eyes hurt especially in the tree sections, maybe fine-tune that a bit. I like the idea in general and that it makes things harder to see (esp. with shadows etc). Make background images (when in the stage menu for example) available somewhere (maybe through achievements/milestones or something like that?) The tracks are damn beautiful but in the car we usually only get a glimpse of it   Now to your questions:     I'm at 18 hours now, playing with a controller. I own a wheel that I plan on using at some point but I'm lazy, controller works good for me. I bought it relatively soon after it was released because I really welcome Codemasters shift in direction towards fan-feedback and developing a product that is actually what the fans want. I think that started somewhere with Grid Autosport. I'm in 3 leagues and I love it. It's my favorite part of Dirt because it just adds something that AI can't give. I like the singleplayer and the progression of it, you really learn a lot and improve over time though. I read every blog post, I especially loved the Pikes Peak one. You did good. Hi ;)"

Other than that I have no issues. Absolutely love the Pikes Peak stage (even though I can't make it 3 minutes in without crashing :) ).

Rally was my favorite discipline from Dirt 3 so it was a no-brainer. So far I've played 109 hours and I like it a lot. I do all the online events and belong to 3 leagues: dirtdaily, reddit, and controllerbros. I do read the road book. The patch situation was handled well. I didn't lose my progress because I read the note in time. I can't wait for more updates! The biggest issue I have with the whole game is engineer perks. Gaining XP faster for a car does not matter too much, especially with a the masters rally where you drive for days anyway. Better perks could be: repair speed bonuses, performance boosts, making cars unlock faster, better repairs on certain stages, or even something not completely positive that would make taking a perk skillful.

Also, this is likely a one-off occurrence but I experienced an issue with a league that I run.  The creator, nor any of the managers, could create a new season.

So it's a success in my eyes. I joined maybe 3 leagues, but I almost never play them, the motivation just isn't there. Also, I didn't even now that the league leader can set up a league so you can't reset it, there should be a popup window with the rules before you start one. I read every blog post, the newest road book was pretty lengthy and detailed, I would enjoy videos of the behind the scenes development more (for example building a track and commenting on it) I was at work thankfully, otherwise I could have easily lost my saves, but the resolution was quick and clean, props for that. The patch supposedly fixed the ""event not saving"" issue, but my championship reset back to stage 2 every time I started the game, tried verifying files, disabling steam cloud, nothing worked. Until I abandoned the current country (event #2, greece), and then started playing #3. Seems fine for now, but had to eat a 16th place for it."

dirtgame,38odt5,shunen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:31:00 2015 UTC,"Have been playing since start (60h playtime) and i enjoy the game alot, but here are some thoughts.   For me Monaco is the location that is my least favorite and i know alot of people will agree. Alot is because the icy sections is just too icy and the handling does not feel right imo. Especially on ""Col de Turini - Sprint en Descente"", the ice section feels so wierd to drive on compared to ""Col de Turini - Départ en Descente"" full ice section. Ive seen in the timeline ""Winter Wonderland"" and guess its a hint for a winter rally somewhere. But do we really want another snow location as alot of people dont like it, ive rather have a epic safari rally! Slightly too much grip and alot of understeer with some cars in my opinion. For example Peugeot 405 T16 and Subaru Impreza it is really hard to turn, even when you try to flick it you end up needing to use the handbreak to make the corners. Make custom events alot more flexible and easy to use. Maybe you want one stage to be in greece and one in wales. Plus add information about each stage when you select like; the map of the road, how long it is, my pb on it."

dirtgame,38odt5,Shuino,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"I currently have 31 hours played and so far I am really enjoying myself. I purchased Dirt Rally on release and pretty much have played a little bit every day since.  I am currently not in a league as I feel I’m not good enough or skilled enough to bother. Maybe once I can win a couple more races in Career and cut down on crashing I will jump into a league. I do read the Road Book and I enjoy reading it while at work since I am not home playing the game. This week’s Road Book was probably my favorite being it had a good bit of inside information on how you tackled Pikes Peak which was pretty interesting. I also enjoyed the video link to Michael E which was pretty fantastic. What I would like to see is maybe some more Rally tips included. This could be from the video you had in today’s Road Book to maybe a short video or tip(s) on how to tackle a certain corner or even a certain stage. It would also be nice to have little updates on what is currently being worked on, maybe even let us know of some of the good ideas us fans thought up which you may try adding into the game.  I am most likely the minority here but the issue this week is something that should have never happened and comes off very unprofessional. Although it was handled quickly and only effected a small player base it still never should have happened. Overall it is only a game so really I am not that upset. But working previously in railway dispatching, writing software requirements and testing, this is something which never ever would have happened in my place of work but again billion dollar railway system to a video game. Not really apples to apples I suppose. One major thing that needs added is being able to just hop right into a custom race/event while being in the middle of a Career series without killing my Career event. Sometimes I just want to jump into Dirt Rally and drive a different car or maybe I was drinking and I don’t want to mess up my Career event drunk driving (Cause this is the internet I feel like I need to mention I don’t drink and drive any real car…). Second and my last idea would be to have a practice pad with cones. Since I did not really know anything about rally racing when I bought this game it would’ve been nice to jump onto a pad and learn to slide all these different cars around or just spend time practicing a pendulum turn over and over again till I really know what I’m doing. Bonus points for having maybe a couple other people join into the same practice pad to give lessons."

How do you feel about our League Support   I am in leagues but my main focus right now is making money in career mode for cars. The league system is cool but I wish there was a little bit more depth to it. It would be nice to have official seasons teams could compete in for prizes. League vs League comparisons would be interesting to see maybe. Maybe reward leagues for reaching certain milestones or being in the top ranks compared to other leagues.   The Road Book - Do you read the Road Book blog post we put up easy week? It it interesting? What kind of thing would you like to see in it?   I love the content of the Road Book as it is. I love seeing the process behind the game.    How do you feel about how we handled this week's drama with the patches?   Not too well. I think the all caps ""DONT PLAY"" made people panic a little. From the outside, people thought the patch was deleting our saves. Things could have been worded more clearly to explain what happened earlier on.   Anything else you'd like to say? Shoot!   My big piece of feedback this week has to do with the Career mode and the Team system. Here's why I don't get expensive crew and how restart breaks career mode.  So what is the difference between a crew member that costs 3,000CR for 32 stages vs one that costs 40,000CR? Really, none. In fact, the earlier you fill your crew, the better it is in the long run. Perks are really strong which makes Perk Slots more valuable than Skill or Efficiency. High skilled crew members are the biggest money sink in the game, more than cars. While the numbers around crews could use a balance pass, the real culprit is something else.  The reset system makes the crew almost worthless. Nothing negative happens when you restart, you just win a little less money. The bonus you lose from restarts is meaningless above Professional level. When you restart a lot you get to make clean laps which means your crew barely needs to work. This also means you can keep redoing each stage until you have a time you are happy with. Restart needs to actually punish drivers or go away completely in career.   Lastly, don't force the repair costs on us at the end of an event and have them be associated with your team's skill rating and level (apologies if it is, I can't tell). Let us keep the car in a damaged condition and let us choose when to repair it. This would give us the choice to switch to a different car for the next event. Eventually I will have to pay for the repair, or let it carry over until the next time I use that car. This would give the cars some persistence between events as well as adding more functionality to the garage. It would be cool to use the garage as a garage instead of just a store.   You guys are doing an incredible job, so please keep it up!"
dirtgame,38odt5,axxor-,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"Been here since day 1. Don't have the free time for a league, so I can't really comment much. I do the daily/weekly/monthly events but that's it. I really like it. I feel like it provides good interaction between the Devs and the community and that's something I wish a lot more games would do. It's good to see you guys developing a game about a topic you're passionate about. Pretty well, mistakes happen and it's just part of the business.   Some general points for improvement and future development;   I feel like the damage is a bit too forgiving. There will be times that I completely misjudge a corner and go flying into a wall or into a ditch and I can keep going with just a few scratches and a smashed windshield.  The sliders for setup adjustment should be able to move one value at a time, rather than in chunks. If I'm setting the brake bias on my car, I want to be able to precisely dial in a value, rather than having to choose between 55% or 67%. What if I want something in between? I don't feel like this would be very difficult to implement and would go a far way towards helping the simulation aspect of this game. I knew I would arrive at the point where I've pretty much driven all the stages and now know them without pace notes at some point given the limited content in early access, yet I feel there are some steps that could be taken to avoid this from happening in the future. Currently there seems to be two longer stages (each with a reverse configuration) per location, with two shorter stages (also with reverse configurations) that are essential the long stage but split into two. While this necessarily isn't a problem, it does mean that you end up seeing all that a location has to offer relatively quickly.    Ideally I would like to see 2-4 special stages added on that feature completely unique scenery to the already existing stages, preferably totaling 20km or longer. An alternative could be keeping the same philosophy for stage design and having 18 stages per location rather than the current 12. Either way, having at least one or two very long special stages per location would be a welcome addition. The stage design itself is good, they provide a good and unique challenge. I just feel like there isn't enough of them.  I have other things but I don't want to make this post too long. Overall I feel like the core game has a lot of potential and provides a very enjoyable experience. Looking forward to seeing this game progress."

dirtgame,38in5f,xLarkins,-3,Thu Jun 4 21:14:58 2015 UTC,So what?  Instead of arranging old game cases id rather see progress updates or at least verbal confirmation of something that the game needs and is lacking.  So sorry for putting my concerns in front of someone who can maybe answer my question.
dirtgame,38ja91,kschang,4,Thu Jun 4 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"I like the idea.  Crashing out of one event should not kick you out of the whole championship.  In real rally as long as you can foot the repair bill you can always come back for the next event (since they are usually a couple of weeks apart.  I also feel that the damage level is... forgiving.  Having some more realistic damage would be sweet and really tilt that frustration of failure/bliss of success scale a little more (bonus cash for more damage?).  I also don't think that this should be an ""advanced"" mode that is only available to high level players. I think that everyone should have the opportunity at every difficulty to experience the supreme frustration of crashing out of an event.  Maybe have this mode be one of those bonus cash items like with turning off your HUD and driving assists.  The other thing about this mode would have to include AI that messes up too occasionally (crashing out, etc.).  Right now it seems to me that the AI rarely really puts a foot wrong, and almost never the top tier drivers."
dirtgame,38ja91,deadstump,3,Thu Jun 4 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"Well, we're assuming pro-am level effort, right? I.e. privateer / non-factory team? Then it's up to $$$ and allowed repair time. But bad crash should definitely DNF one or more stages, though we can debate whether we wanto to allow WRC style ""super rally rule"" where the DNF can rejoin by taking a X minute penalty, i.e. bottom + X minutes?   I personally think career plus mode should be kinda ""elite of elite"" type event that needs special qualifiers, and if any one won a season on Masters they definitely qualify, though obviously we can negotiate on how high to set the bar.   AI does screw up, but we often don't see it. I agree that the top drivers do seem a bit too... consistent. But when driving at lower levels I've seen the 3rd level guy went all the way down to 12th by next stage."
dirtgame,38ja91,Wyrm,6,Thu Jun 4 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"No, people may want more realism / a more difficult game even when they're not that good, you can't lock a game mechanic like that behind a gate that relatively few people will even get."
dirtgame,38ja91,deadstump,3,Thu Jun 4 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the repair bit.  At minimum you should be out until the next service.  I really think that if there were the return the rally bit were to happen it should be a minimum of two services (max 6 stages min 5 with the two stage/service at this level) before you could return with some really crappy boggy times as time fillers.  DNFing should more or less put you out of the rally.  However I feel that in those situations where you are 'unrecoverable' (but not too damaged... like when you slide down the hill in Greece) you should be able to be pulled out by the heavy sweep team and continue with only a really bad stage time rather than a DNF.  I disagree with your eliet bit though.  I know that I am not the fastest driver, but I already run with no restarts as a personal creed (I have violated it from time to time much to my personal disappointment... they really should fix that 4 right to finish on Greece, it is a a 3 at best).  People who are so inclined should be able to run a 'real' rally if they want and be rewarded for it.  You could still have the difficulty levels since in real life there are various levels of competition.  I think that I am on pro or the level above pro right now and I swear the top three guys are rock solid.  They are usually putting in times that are so consistent from stage to stage that the gap is more or less predictable.  The top guy never seems to crash out."
dirtgame,38ja91,Miltrivd,2,Thu Jun 4 20:28:12 2015 UTC,A more realistic damage mode would be nice indeed.
dirtgame,38ja91,SurvivorHarrington,3,Fri Jun 5 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea! The only things I would add are:  1) This mode should be accessible from the start. I don't see any reason why it should be locked away from people who want a more authentic rally experience from the beginning.  2) Expanding on the no restarts ever, I think that it would be essential that quitting out in any way during a stage should register a DNF  3) As mentioned by another user, the A.I. should be less consistent (becoming more consistent at higher championship levels). This would really help to reward finding a balance between driving conservatively and pushing as much as possible  I feel a mode like this would fit perfectly with the spirit of the game... Please codemasters!"
dirtgame,38ja91,Miltrivd,3,Thu Jun 4 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"But... That's how I play... That's not how everyone plays?! I got demoted from Professional into Clubman (couldn't get used to the 205, retired 2/3 and barely finished the other one) and had to get to Professional again and now made it into Elite.  What I mean is, this already exist, you already have it... Just don't restart, ever. It's so much more fun pushing the car and missing a few heartbeats when you go too close to a cliff or after a bad landing after a jump.  Just go for it! :D  P.S.: Confused the difficulties names :P"

dirtgame,38ilns,Powerjugs,3,Thu Jun 4 16:06:16 2015 UTC,It seems a bit harsh but I think crashing should be treated exactly the same as quitting out during the race. I think it's the only way to get around the exploitation.

dirtgame,38ilns,InTheCatBoxAgain,2,Fri Jun 5 02:41:54 2015 UTC,This has already been addressed in another thread.  You don't even have to alt f4.  You can just save and quit and then start the race over again to restart that stage.  CM is working on a fix but no ETA.
dirtgame,38ilns,euronate,0,Thu Jun 4 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"At least for online, the game should upload a DNF/Retired as soon as you launch the event and overwrite it once you finish with your time. If you Alt+F4/task kill you'd try to restart but the DNF status would have been there already, rendring this cheesy tactic useless.  For exceptions like power loss, PC crashing and so on it would be sadly a DNF/Retired just like if it would be if it was played in real time against other players. I'm thinking they have not enabled this yet purely because it's Early Access and the game has stability issues for a sector of the player base."

dirtgame,38jghz,ExpletiveBanana,2,Thu Jun 4 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"Hm, I disagree. You don't stand a chance in a league if you've never driven that specific car, upgrades or not. Why not invest the time to 'learn' the car if you want to win the league?  Also, this is a motivation to play single player mode, which is something I think the game needs"
dirtgame,38jghz,salmonelladub,0,Thu Jun 4 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that, I'm pretty handy in any Group B car but the only one with any upgrades is the Peugeot which means if I'm driving something in the leagues, I can't practice the vehicle -because- that's the upgraded version in the Custom Event and I don't particularly want to put time back into say, the Mini (I used the Fulvia) to upgrade it for a league event.  It would make more sense honestly to just have the upgraded cars for league events. Or maybe even the OPTION to say 'bring your own car' (like we did for Controllerbros last season) or use the full beef for the allotted vehicle."
dirtgame,38jghz,salmonelladub,0,Thu Jun 4 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"If I understand this correctly, your problem is that in custom mode, the car doesn't accurately reflect what you're driving in leagues?  A solution for that would be to 'bring your own car' in custom mode, like it used to be.  Think about this: Why do you want the fully upgraded version of a car?  The idea behind the upgrade system is that you start with a version of the car that is slower, so you can get used to driving it. Once you've logged some hours and get used to how it handles, it gets faster. This is both a reward, and a way to make your first races in a new car more managable."
dirtgame,38jghz,salmonelladub,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:30:13 2015 UTC,'Why do you want the fully upgraded version of a car?'  Because if I haven't bought the car in career mode I'm down up to 100hp for no good reason if the league event is using it. There's a LOT of cars to grind in the career mode and some of them I'd rather drive once and be done with. It's just a pain in the arse to get given the Mini for an event and I now can't compete for 1st place no matter how well I drive the tracks because I'm down on top speed by a fair margin when the track opens up. You wouldn't give a runner flip flops when he's on the starting line next to Usain Bolt.
dirtgame,38jghz,salmonelladub,0,Thu Jun 4 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"No, but my point is that you're not going to beat Usain Bolt, flip or no flop. You won't compete for 1st even if you get all upgrades vs. someone who actually knows/likes/drives the car.  If you don't like the car, why do you want to win in that car? I think the current system works fine to introduce people to new cars, and would hate to see it disappear.  I see the point you raised about custom mode no longer being a good practice area because the car now differs from your competing car. That's a problem, but I'm not sure this is the solution."
dirtgame,38jghz,salmonelladub,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"I won't if I'm not on a level playing field. That's not the point. It's that if we're driving a SINGLE car for an event, EVERYONE should get the same car. Not multiple versions of the same car depending on whether or not someone's already driven it. We already have it for the DiRT Dailies, why can't we have it for Leagues (or better, have it an option we can set for the season.)"

Some games aim for the end game, this one I play for the fun of the game itself, I was surprised and happy enough with the amazingly fast Germany update right after Pike's Peak.   In my opinion, this is how you do early access games right. Aside from the repetitiveness of playing the three rallies a lot, it feels like a complete game already. The quick reaction after this kind of unfortunate incident says a LOT about the developer. Awesome stuff!"
dirtgame,38dva8,SimonCharles,5,Wed Jun 3 16:11:25 2015 UTC,All of the new cars and tracks of the germany-update where awesome! I hope it does not take long for the final-release of this update.

DiRT Rally will overtake it by the time it's out of Early Access... but yeah.... if you've been waiting decades then you missed out on the best rally game out so far.
dirtgame,38cuza,chkltcow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:35:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, decades. RBR was good, but even with mods, the graphics were crap.

CM's nailed it for me with this one."

In fact, most of those are the reason I was had so much trepidation about buying DiRT Rally.  Yes, Codemasters.... I'm saying your other racing games (TOCA, F1, Grid, etc) were godawful :(  So glad I took a chance on this one though! :D"
dirtgame,38cuza,chkltcow,2,Wed Jun 3 13:22:29 2015 UTC,"TOCA was my first experience with serious online racing communities. I loved that game so much even though I sucked so, so bad at it.   Alot of the good racers would let me tag along in their matches as long as I agreed to obey blue flags, which I did. Really bred the love of racing games in me.   So, no matter how much that game ""sucked"" it still rocked my world."

dirtgame,38cuza,thekrautboy,8,Wed Jun 3 12:11:26 2015 UTC,What a twit. They just released a big surprise patch (albiet accidentally) and they never fail to disappoint you? Maybe early access isn't for you.
dirtgame,38dslt,DANNYonPC,5,Wed Jun 3 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"So... As some of you may be aware we hit our first big rock on the Early Access road today and we pushed an incorrect version of DiRT Rally live.   This was essentially our development build containing parts of our Germany update, which is a bit of a problem because we haven’t finished that yet and chunks of the game were missing and would appear broken.   This next part is where it gets complicated.   We’ve now set the correct patch live which is 1.6 GB. However if you had already downloaded the large (and wrong) 4 GB patch you will now be asked to download another 1.6 GB patch.   TL;DR - The 1.6 GB is safe. The 4 GB one is not safe.   Please do not download the 4 GB patch. If it is half way through, paused or stuck midway please stop the download, log out and close your Steam Client and re-open it. The correct patch should then download.   If you have already downloaded the 4 GB patch, please do not start the game, download the 1.6 GB patch and you should be fine.   If you have already played the game after the 4 GB patch and downloaded the new 1.6 GB patch we’re expecting this to corrupt your save file when you try and play the game.   If you happen to be one of those whose save has corrupted please post a reply below and let us know, we may want to get hold of a copy of your corrupt save so if you can make a copy of your save file before overwriting it that would really help us out.   The reason it corrupts is because when you loaded the version with Germany it introduces new items in your save file to check the game against, now we’ve taken the unfinished content out of the game your save file will be looking for something which isn’t there and corrupt.   If you’re having trouble loading the game once you have the most up to date patch please verify the integrity of the game cache. To do this right click on DiRT Rally in your library, select properties, click the local files tab and then press the “verify integrity of game cache” button. If it still does not load after this please let us know in the comments below.   The unfinished patch was live for about 40 minutes, starting at 12pm (BST). During that time our data tells us that a very small number of people played the game (less than 0.5%). We’re hoping that the corrupt save won’t affect all those players but regardless of how many it has hit we are sorry.   Now on to the correct Patch notes for DiRT Rally V0.4.1   Save Game Fix - Fixed an issue which prevented the game from saving mid event   Achievement Fix – Hillclimb achievements now unlock correctly, these will award from now on but we will retroactively award the Going Up In The World achievement in a future pack  Track Environment update – J.McG’s Invisible Towing Services have now removed the invisible Burger Van that sometimes rolled into the middle of the road on Pikes Peak and their permit has been revoked (they tasted like thin air anyway)   Online Events – Daily challenges now feature the full fat fully upgraded versions of the cars.   Audio Fix – Sent the co-driver on another recce of the Col De Turini and asked him to redo his notes  Again we’re sorry for all the confusion and to those affected, we hope you enjoyed your sneaky peek at Germany. You’ll be able to play a much more stable version soon.   Hugs and kisses   Team DiRT."

dirtgame,38e16x,jay_p_666,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely noticed it and I think the entire video had wide track. I often get this from many games, from drivin the track look quite narrow, but in replay it reveals a road capable of 4 cars side by side without touching the grass.  As it looks like from the birds eye view here."
dirtgame,38e16x,snoozieboi,4,Thu Jun 4 11:22:29 2015 UTC,"Have you take a look at the latest DiRT Road Book on dirtgame.com? I think you should. One of the level artist talk about their trip when making a new track and how they're taking as much reference pics and data to make stage as accurate and realistic as possible including right measurement of road width.   The track you see in this video is very accurate, It's called Panzerplatte. Just Google ''panzerplatte onboard'' and you will see the real track is just as wide as in DiRT Rally. As you will see Codies made it just right and the stage is perfect.   Not all stages in Germany are this wide though and I hope we'll get some more narrower stage too...especially in vineyards!!"

dirtgame,38d9yj,XmattbeeX,3,Wed Jun 3 13:53:18 2015 UTC,"I kind of like this idea!  I think that we should get something like 3 shakedown runs like in the normal rallies just to come up to speed.  I don't know how I feel about being able to tweak the setups (I know you didn't bring this up).  On one hand having a car that handles like you want is awesome, but on the other it really benefits those who have their setups really dialed already."
dirtgame,38d9yj,deadstump,2,Wed Jun 3 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Nice idea but in an age of internet, it'll still take no effort for anyone to find out what the daily is if they really want to know. In the end this will just be a waste of people's time if they want to know what the event is."
dirtgame,38d9yj,Ruskia,2,Wed Jun 3 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"Good point.  But how many people do the daily events anyway?  If the number was high enough, maybe you could give people one of five or ten randomly chosen stages, and have them compete only with people doing that stage."
dirtgame,38d9yj,jtr99,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:27:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing could stop it completely, but it would improve things. And giving a shakedown would give people less reason to.  My other thought that would get around this issue, would be to  release a full week of daily events on Monday, and every player gets a random pick from those each day of the week as they enter. So at the end of the week everyone will have done all the daily events, but not knowing each day which they were to receive (apart from on the final day). But then it isn't really a daily event any more :) Can't win, curse you internet."
dirtgame,38d9yj,Ruskia,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:31:10 2015 UTC,The internet is one big bully.  ...Yeah there's no real way to solve the issue I guess. Just demotivate them a little.

dirtgame,38d9yj,optimatorz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yea a larger pool would help. Additionally, having to wait a week for everyone to play up to 7 random events out of 10 means no-one could get any rewards until the end of the week, so it would feel more like the weekly event than the daily one at that point..  Kind of off topic, but I've started retiring from FWD events, I hate those cars so much."

Repeat what the codriver is saying either out loud or in your 'active voice' in your head.  It takes a little bit to let this soak in, but by simply repeating the note it kind of reinforced it and caused me to not to gloss so many over.  Eventually it became second nature and it seems to have wired itself into my 'passive voice' in my head (the one that runs in the background rather than the one that thinks of the next witty thing to say)."

dirtgame,38e39h,Ramrodicus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"It takes practice. Then again, the greatest feeling while playing a good rally game is when something ""clicks"", you get into the flow and pretty much stop actually listening to the pacenotes, you just kinda ""sense"" them and act accordingly. it does not happen that often (well, at least not to me), but when it does happen, it's great."

(Dog, Food, Food, Food...)  For example, I struggled on Monte Carlo earlier this week playing at 6.30 to 7GMT so I left it and came back about 10-10.30 later. I breezed it coming 2nd (No assists or HUD as that has helped me focus more on the co-driver and track) so it maybe you might want to see when you concentrate best when gaming and label it DiRT Rally time?"

dirtgame,38c06w,SimonCharles,2,Wed Jun 3 07:54:04 2015 UTC,"Nice idea! Really helpful if you want to learn how to work the pedals, which isn't necessarily that self-explanatory in rally, if all you've driven is a normal street car (not a tram :P).  That said, any tips on improving rally driving in regards to pedals? Is it more usual to left-foot brake in rally than not? I've left-foot braked in most racing games before because it felt easier, but recently I've tried using right foot gas and brake because that's what I've used in real life  ""normal"" driving, and I've started using the clutch as well. I can't seem to find any conclusive info on what racing drivers normally do."
dirtgame,38c06w,Slokan,2,Wed Jun 3 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"There is no conclusive info, as it's a matter of personal preference, but left foot braking is quite common in rally. Left foot is for the clutch, right foot for the accelerator. You use both feet for the brakes, depending on the situation.  If you need to use the clutch while braking, then you use your right foot (braking section before a sharp corner for example, where you need to gear down). If you don't need to gear down, but just slow down a little, to bring the weight toward the front of the car, you use your left foot to brake.  Easier to type than to actually do :)."

dirtgame,38b4fs,mrvile,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:02:29 2015 UTC,The problem i have with the game is that you never feel like you have any grip.  I mean i understand lack of grip on dirt/gravel but even on the tarmac pikes peak the car is just sliding from side to side down the straight for no reason which just makes no sense.
dirtgame,38b4fs,QuadroMan1,4,Wed Jun 3 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"Dirt Rally's tarmac handling is weird. The offroad feels good but in the Alps and especially at Pike's Peak, the car just doesn't work how I expect it to, at least after a hundred hours of Assetto Corsa."
dirtgame,38b4fs,mrvile,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"The cars feel way too grippy on Tarmac IMO but, sort of like you, this is after lots of hours in iRacing/Project Cars.  This could have to do with the FFB too, there's no real physical indicator of when you're oversteering/understeering or when you're hitting the cars limits, more just you reacting to what happens on screen alone rather than including what the FFB is telling you."
dirtgame,38b4fs,mazdarati2,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:25:12 2015 UTC,"Regarding #3, I'm pretty sure Codemasters bumped up the audio feedback for traction loss in the latest patch. Before I really couldn't hear anything, but now the gravel kicks audibly and the tires will screech across tarmac. Could it be more sensitive and have a better dynamic range? Yes. But there's definitely something now, and it has helped my driving a lot."
dirtgame,38b4fs,SnuifDuif,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed with 7. There's a bend on Pikes Peak that sends you in the air when you cut it a couple of centimeters too much.  Also 8.

Once you have the handling figured out enough to do that then you can go crazy and really push it and crash and all that jazz because you have a base to fall back to.

dirtgame,3858yq,englishbyname,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:54:25 2015 UTC,"I second learning the tracks too, because the pacenotes are still iffy in some spots. I know there's a certain Wales stage where the backwards version I constantly dive into the woods like 3-4 turns in because theres a Right-3 right after a crest and the turn isn't called until you're ready to jump the crest and you end up launching into the woods. There's also a Greece stage where I constantly run into a patch of rocks because by the time the co-driver says ""don't cut"", I'm already halfway through the turn and about to hit the rocks.  Also, ditch the FWD cars ASAP. I hopped into this game after playing Codemaster's mostly arcadier entries into the rally genre (Colin Mcrae 2005, Dirt 2, Dirt 3), and in the career mode, I was finishing 4th/5th-ish in all the stages on my first go around (all assists off, no HUD). My second go-around, I finished 3rd overall so I unlocked the Clubman stages. Bought a RWD car, and I've finished 1st in all the Clubman stages of the first event so far because I'm not losing time on tight turns and hairpins anymore. I can't imagine how much better the 4WD cars are going to feel and control. The difference between FWD and RWD was night and day already."
dirtgame,3858yq,LsK101,2,Tue Jun 2 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"Ditching FWD I don't think is very good advice. While FWD / RWD handle differently the FWD drive cars are slower, easier to drive and control. Driving those FWD cars can really naturally teach you to transfer weight because not doing so really slows those older cars down.   My advice would be learn and understand how each car drives and handles. Taking to the time really understand how each car handles under braking, sliding, and acceleration will make you a better driver."
dirtgame,3858yq,Shuino,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"FWD cars are much harder to screw up. RWD cars are more nimble but with that caveat they are lot easier to screw up with. They each have their charms.   And FWD cars can be just as fast if driver properly. Altonen and other flying Finns was using FWD Saabs and Minis and winning rallies with their own flying techniques. They pioneered left-foot-braking, pendulum turn (Scandinavian Flick), and the Altonen rear-wheel braking setup (i.e. turn turns without handbrake)"
dirtgame,3858yq,kschang,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:35:56 2015 UTC,"Go Slow. Stay on the track.  Personally I usually shorten the gear ratios to get more low end acceleration, since I spend 95% of the time under maximum speed.  I don't know about others but I prefer decelerating over braking heavily.  Also the FWD 1960s cars are hard, the game gets easier when you get better cars. Don't give up! And don't fret about not doing great in the 1960s cars."
dirtgame,3858yq,kinnadian,2,Tue Jun 2 20:54:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't agree with the 1960's cars being hard it's just a different style of driving. I came into this game with very little rally knowledge and spent a good bit of time in the FWD cars. The FWD cars really do naturally teach you to transfer weight.

dirtgame,382mz8,Shuino,3,Mon Jun 1 14:41:55 2015 UTC,i will try :)
dirtgame,382mz8,Rally_Mike,2,Mon Jun 1 14:47:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! To be honest I have been playing racing games for a long time now and only recently stepped into the sim side of things. I have come to understand now there is so much I do not know about the car(s) and just trying to learn by driving I have come to a pretty large hurdle where I don't seem to be getting better. Over the past few weeks playing Dirt Rally with no knowledge about any Rally technique I have naturally picked up some of the things in the video. For example moving from FWD to RWD was a huge change in car handling and left me a bit frustrated. I could no longer fix mistakes with more throttle. I kept wanting to pull myself through an apex which landed me with an insane amount of understeer. Being frustrated I tried anything I thought would work which led me to left foot braking and much finer throttle control with a slow linear throttle through an apex. I believe my next big thing to tackle will be trying to slide the car to control speed. I still have a mindset of hard late braking into turns and kind of power sliding through the turn slowly getting more throttle. This obviously isn’t best seeing how others race but hopefully this video and maybe others will help me understand how to slide around and still feel in control of the car.
dirtgame,382mz8,Shuino,3,Mon Jun 1 19:43:39 2015 UTC,I gave this a watch. Wasn't to excited because I'm playing with an XB1 controller and most of the tutorial stuff I've seen on here is for wheels or I just haven't seen it.   He mentions using the throttle and brake (not handbrake) at the same time during cornering. Oh my I've been doing it wrong for the longest time. I had the right joystick up for throttle and down for brake/reverse. Moved brake/reverse to a trigger. WOW. Thanks for posting this.
dirtgame,382mz8,Razzeus,2,Mon Jun 1 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah left-foot braking is essential for rally driving, and for those of us with wheel/pedal setups, making the transition from daily real-world driving to left-foot braking is pretty difficult, especially when also using a clutch. I'm currently making the transition to left-foot braking while playing Dirt Rally and it really messes with my head, I miss-shift a lot and modulation is difficult with my left foot. Practice makes perfect.  I've also read that you really shouldn't rely on the handbrake too much in basic rally driving, and should be using flicks to get around tight corners. Consider that Group B cars didn't even have handbrakes, and that was the golden era of rally."
dirtgame,382mz8,mrvile,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:07:30 2015 UTC,"yeah shit, after starting with left-food breaking in racing sims, I sometimes did it by instinct in my real car. The breaking feel is extremely different, and I'd slam the breaks with my left food in my real car, and upset the car :S Haven't done it in a long time though.  I heal-toe/rev-match every single down shift though, from habit after sim racing. And I want to learn left-foot breaking in my real car, but since I only drive it on the road, there is no advantage in doing so. It's a really slow car too... And not sporty at all."

dirtgame,3849cn,Rysup,3,Tue Jun 2 09:27:45 2015 UTC,"For me it's like a 30-40% chance og getting beached on those even with speed going back on track.    I can hardly remember this happening in RBR and in real WRC (edit, uh... on TV of course), sure it's absolutely possible, but the gravel piles are rock solid now. I'd love them to add some ""softening effect"".     Some of them you can hit flying with just the lower tips of the wheels and your car still changes direction like you hit a 1,5m tall wall.    No problem living with it for now, just stay on the road :)"

dirtgame,3849cn,Ausrufepunkt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"I can live with them buggering up a great run, but the fact you get beached on them is a little too harsh I find.  By all means make it noticeable when you hit them but don't stop the player completing a run without resetting the car, as I always restart the run rather than recover everytime. It's punishing rather than challenging."

dirtgame,383kza,Buck-O,2,Tue Jun 2 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Its a common problem with almost all racing games I've played. You fall through the terrain mesh from a jump, or hit it at an odd angle where you breach through a gap in the mesh, and basically the physics engine freaks out, and makes you hit a brick wall of sorts. Hopefully most of these are corrected sooner rather than later though."

dirtgame,385gqt,Agentofsociety,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:51:24 2015 UTC,Just keep playing. You'll get to a wall but if you continue you'll eventually start to master the tracks and gradually be faster. I'm at the 30 hour mark and just now I could beat the elite championship and it feels awesome ! Just stick with it and you'll surpass the wall.
dirtgame,385gqt,stasisbal,6,Wed Jun 3 14:59:58 2015 UTC,"The top AI times are often annoyingly great but they do occasional mess up a round.  I've finished 3rd in a championship by getting 4th, 4th, and 5th in each section.  Best I've done overall is 2nd, so 1st is still illusive to me.  I think you just need to adjust your expectations and perspective.  Getting 1st would be great but it's not the end all measure of success in the game.  Top 3 get to the next championship level, I see that as a big victory.  Any decent position I've finished in gets a solid payout.  If nothing else I'm always happy just have have a nice clean run.  Play the game for it's own sake.  If you do ever get 1st place it will feel awesome."

dirtgame,385gqt,deadstump,3,Tue Jun 2 03:48:35 2015 UTC,I understand your main point - the top 3 AI are usually miles better than the rest and more often than not miles better than the player.  But on the other hand you can't say the game isn't fair... You can come off the track at 80MPH and fly into a tree head first and simply reverse out and drive away with a little bit of radiator damage.  The game rewards you far more for staying on the track for the whole sprint - do that and you'll find yourself top 5 every time.
dirtgame,385gqt,kinnadian,2,Tue Jun 2 09:07:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  I am not going to say that I am an amazing driver or anything, but I fairly routinely finish in the top tier of times on the weekly rally and the best I have ever finished against the AI is second... and never won a stage.  At the lower difficulties a moderately skilled player should be able to wipe the floor with the AI... then they move up until they hit their limits.    I get that just finishing is and should be an accomplishment, but at the lower difficulties you should be able to win if you run a clean somewhat quick rally.  Also I would really appreciate it if the AI made a few more sever mistakes every now and again.  As it stands the top few drivers rarely battle each other and almost never have a big off or something to really set them back, even WRC drivers crash."
dirtgame,382x0f,deadstump,2,Mon Jun 1 13:48:01 2015 UTC,I noticed this as well. For me it only has trouble saving damper settings that I have noticed. I think changing the cars to advanced setups for custom events created a bug in saving setups.

Even with a few mistakes you can still win on Master but in the custom events the AI is just nuts, and seems like the difficulties are switched around as the clubman feels faster than Master at times.   Custom events, yes. The AI is a bucket of doolally but in career mode it's fine. Either that or you just have to learn to drive.  And jesus christ don't go assaulting the devs, prick.

Quattro rotates as good as 205 and is maybe a bit faster on lower sections but lacks power on higher parts of the road.  405 rotates horribly but that can be fixed with setup tweaks and personally I'm fastest with it.

Everybody is supposed to get one shot, even playing field, but lots of people force quit the game to get more attempts and it's not fair to the rest of the leaderboards.  Doing the save & exit trick is still cheating, but I care less about it because it doesn't really affect anyone else but the player.  Besides, once you get to the higher championship levels you earn something like 200k per event and a reset is what, 5k?  Big freaking deal."

dirtgame,37ra9n,shunen,3,Sun May 31 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"This is a game. The tracks are difficult to remember plus the AI demands a clean, fast race.

dirtgame,37ra9n,justbiglee,6,Fri May 29 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with the top comment. If someone is doing it in the career mode, it is affecting only them. The time it takes to save and quit and get back into a race isn't worth the small credit loss. If a person thinks it is, it's their choice.  For the real issue, force closing the game for any multiplayer should cause the race to be retired. If multiplayer races are tracked live that should be easy, although I assume they just have the final times sent in to the leaderboard."

I like the pure hillclimb aspect where there are no notes, except that I want notes.  Maybe a rally version of it with notes? I really would like to drive the hillclimb cars on the other stages because it would be awesome.  Also visa versa. Could we have Pike's peak chopped into stages and have an American rally?  That would be a neat environment (and maybe encourage some of the stages used in the Cog Rally).  Also maybe run the course downhill. This isn't limited to the hillclimb stuff but when we are setting up a quick event, changing the weather and time of day is not super intuitive.  Dropping to that sub menu is clunky feeling.  Maybe we could change the weather/time of da using the same buttons we use to change the liveries on the cars rather than the sub menu. Any chance that you will push out a full gravel Pikes Peak?  I really want to recreate Climb Dance It looks like you forgot one of the main features of Pikes Peak.  The jumping checkered sweater vest flag man at the end!  He is a fixture of every Pikes Peak.

But where you can expand please give us teasers... a good example of that is the 037, so excited. Could you include the real life course record for each configuration as a side note so we can be awed by their greatness?

dirtgame,37q447,DD_Power,4,Sat May 30 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"•This week we want your feedback on our latest update  I like the car selection, it’s perfect. The most important legendary cars are there, don’t need anything else. I have nothing to say about Pikes Peak, it’s just perfect in every areas and it’s being beautifully recreated to the thinest detail.   I think the Pikes Peak cars power is more accurate, it’s a good start in the right direction. But all  other cars feels underpowered, especially Group B and WRC cars.   I’ve read in an interview with Paul Coleman that you guys tried RBR during development of the game but thought the game was harder than the real thing. To me, it sounds like you based your feedback on the NGP mod because I’ve never found RBR hard at all with the physics files that comes with the cars modded into the game… it even feel easier than DiRT Rally sometimes.   Fact is… NGP got released in 2014 if I remember right and game was released in 2004 so, 10 years of people praising the game without NGP cannot be wrong.   RBR is still waaay more fun to drive and here’s why : Cars are more accurately powerful and there is much less lateral grip so we can slide smoothly from one corner to another. The feeling you get out of it is much more satisfying. Also braking distance is longer and you get a better sound feedback from the tyres sliding. Handbrake makes the cars slides much more than in DiRT Rally which in the end is more fun.  Update: As well as what I've said above, I think I've understood what's wrong with DiRT Rally handling... it seems the back of the car is sliding more than the front whereas in RBR the car sliding is more uniform so it gives a more natural, nicer flow and an easier understanding of the car behavior. The result is a more fun gameplay!!  I suggest you to try the Ford Focus WRC ’06 (physics files included) on Japan – Noiker 13,8km stage, it is still a blast to play even after 10 years, it never gets old.  I’ve uploaded mod here : http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=83773380892164470387  Just unzip and copy/paste files in game folder. Car is replacing Subaru 2003 in game. To revert back to original Subaru 2003, just unzip and copy/paste these files in game folder: http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=05607974317384590279  I really hope you will give it a try and that you will change your mind because DiRT Rally is sooo close to RBR, but unfortunately not quiet there yet.   Yesterday I was reading this thread on reddit (RBR vs DR): https://www.reddit.com/r/simrally/comments/34xvwx/rbr_vs_dirt_rally_physics_and_gameplay/  What got my attention is this point which I tend to agree with:   No actual gravel feedback sound from tires rolling on surface, just ambient pebbles flying about wheel hubs. If one fires up RBR and do a gravel stage you hear tons of feedback from the ""grip situation"" of your tire to the ground. Very, very informing of how you are pushing it and very telling if your wheel is rolling or slipping in any direction combined with what you are doing.  And please take a look at this thread in the Suggestion Box, it’s something badly missing too in the game: http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/6156/improvement-proper-modeling-of-tire-spin#latest  •Was the new content easy to find in game? Yes, very easy, nothing to say here.  •How do you feel about what we've added?  Helicopter and national flags throughout the event are welcome additions... I hope to see them in standard rally mode. Classic liveries for Escort MK2, Peugeot 205 etc. is great too. But I think you should focus priority also on fixing these very annoying bugs:   Game keeps resetting resolution and struggling to goes fullscreen. See this thread: http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/6613/why-game-keeps-resetting-resolution-and-fullscreen-on-alt-tab-its-atrocious#latest Game doesn't saving controller preset and switch to keyboard after each game restart. Game doesn't save customized controller button mapped after game restart. Please add an option to get rid of the ragdoll effect (hands and steering wheel shaking and moving) for keyboard and gamepad users. I'm sure some would really like that the visual input is giving correct feedback of what we're actually doing on controller. It makes me feel like I'm not totally in control of the car. Please allow us to switch it on/off if desired.    •What do you love the most in the Pikes Peak Update?  Audi Quattro S1. Please make the Evo2 version for rally events, this is such a legendary car!!  •Was it easy to find out what we'd added?  Yup! Menu is clear enough though still lack the stage length.  •Did you watch this week's DiRT Show? What did you think?  It was great.

dirtgame,37q447,jay_p_666,3,Sat May 30 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"Good stuff /u/jay_p_666.  Regarding the RBR speed.  I think that RBR is a little too fast IMO.  The cars usually have next to no trouble with wheel spin and I find myself banging through the gears a faster than I feel I would in real life (or say if I were watching a real rally video).  But that being said, a lot of DiRT feels a little slow at times.  I think there is a happy land somewhere between the two.  What you said regarding the FFB and wheel spin are spot on.  The only thing that I strongly disagree with you on is the NGP cars.  I think that they are awesome.  My favorite is the MkII Golf.  It behaves just right (I have one).  The Left Foot Braking with the NGP cars is just so satisfying."
dirtgame,37q447,deadstump,1 point,Sat May 30 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you /u/deadstump for comment. I completely agree with you that DR cars are too slow and RBR too fast. Like you said, something between the two would be perfect. About NGP physics...well, I'm talking about it keeping in mind what Paul Coleman said about it. He found it harder than the real thing and it seems they're not aiming at something close to NGP so I thought it would be appropriated to let them know about the existence of other mods which to me are realistic fair enough and closer to DR handling ;)"
dirtgame,37q447,jay_p_666,2,Sat May 30 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"I remember Coleman also saying they never tried any mods when they looked into rbr, just the base game which they thought was too hard on you compared to real life."
dirtgame,37q447,gheeDi,4,Sat May 30 08:25:05 2015 UTC,"This week we want your feedback on our latest update    Latest update... For me biggest things where the saturation fix, you dont need to press ESC now every new stage. Also custom events having full power cars is great, but it also highlights the problem with daily event that in the daily you do NOT have equal upgrades to everyone else, like you said it should be in your online events explained -blogpost.  Like others here have said I think the biggest problem (maybe only?) is that lateral grip can feel too much, especially sliding into corners and hairpins. Feels like the car has no weight transfer, which causes it to slide more than it does now.     Was the new content easy to find in game?     Yeah, no problems there.    How do you feel about what we've added?    They've been good, very conservative I think though. No radical changes yet which I think might sometimes be necessary in a early access title. You shouldn't be afraid of pushing radical updates to make the game better at this point of development i think.    What do you love the most in the Pikes Peak Update?    The mixed surface is a blast to drive on, I love it.    Was it easy to find out what we'd added?     Yep.    Did you watch this week's DiRT Show? What did you think?    I watched first half of it I think. Good stuff, sadly I don't have much free time right now so couldn't watch all of it."
dirtgame,37q447,gheeDi,3,Sat May 30 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"About the lateral grip.. I just looked for something on the ""launch day jitters"" livestream vod and heard coleman talk about the physics. He said lot of the simulation comes from the surface, which I believe is quite correct and important in simulating rally physics. It made me also realize that what many of us say is lack of lateral grip, might just be that the ""dynamic road surface"" where your tires eat into the gravel and cause you to slow down might be overdone? The lateral grip issue is in high speed slides, which i think might actually be because the tires sink too much and/or too fast into the gravel, slowing it down way too much compared to real life. Atleast in Wales the gravel in many parts looks somewhat like that here in Finland and that can be quite a tight surface underneath the bit of loose gravel that is on the road. So the road surface simulation might be something to look into aswell."

Communication has still been great and I appreciate the very detailed patch notes.  The bad: I feel like the hillclimb mode broke my game (now fixed?) and I almost (?) lost all my progress to date (41 hours). I am now avoiding hillclimb mode until some of the saved game strangeness gets patched up. I was playing a league event, finished my first run, abandoned my 2nd run in a sector and I was recorded as DNF for the whole sector. Then upon exit the game crashed. When I attempted to restart I got nothing but error 41.     See this: http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtgame/comments/37pn2e/help_how_can_i_force_the_game_to_use_my_steam/"

Mode is easy to find, easy to start, no complaints there Hillclimb is a nice addition to DR, even though I don't like it as much as rally, it's fun to play for a while (and to farm money >:D) I like the track, and that there are 2 variations of it. Also the 405 is a fine car. Watched the show, aside from the technical difficulties it was nice and relaxed, and I'm jealous of the guys who won swag. Is there a place I can buy a T shirt or stickers?   Things I found out on my own and didn't know before, maybe include similar information in the stream:  Details of the game mode, for example HC is 2 runs per stage, best run counts, you can abandon run 2 if you want (but only after crossing the start line). Also I didn't know what the community delta was and where I  can find it (average times of all players I think, can set it up in custom game instead of an AI), also that I can set the difficulty of it. I know, newbie things, but maybe there are some more people like me."

It is a difficult tightrope to walk though since it is easy to slightly over do it for some types of impact.  For instance, the broken windshield now.  I clip a bank with the back of the side of my car and my front window brakes?  I realize that it is the most user visible form of damage, but common."

EDIT: the Peugeot 405 is actually pretty good after some steering sensitivity and linearity adjustments to make it MORE twitchy. The 205 becomes less awful if you make it LESS twitchy, and the Quattro feels like a lost case, I don't want to even touch it."
dirtgame,37q447,DD_Power,1 point,Fri May 29 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Ive had troubles too, you just need to adjust your driving. You cannot slide so top priority is to keep the car on track. Don't be afraid to brake, but do so without touching the wheel much Be easy on the throttle in corners, even 5 or 6 cannot be done with 100% throttle. Also keep in mind that going uphill makes it easier to lose grip as soon as the road gets a bit flatter.     It took me 20 tries to figure out how to drive them, so just keep on trying. If you still can't make it let me know I'll get you a better reply since I'm on mobile right now"
dirtgame,37q447,Ausrufepunkt,2,Sat May 30 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that despite the fact that all cars demand adaptation, in this case it feels completely off because these cars behave in a weird manner. So in order to stay on the track, you gotta be ultra careful, so you are forced to be slow, when in reality (of course I've never driven one of those) they should be good under braking and over turns, because that's the point with these cars; that's what they're supposed to do best. So making a hillclimb car that is difficult to handle when braking and when it's making turns is really really weird. It doesn't seem to be that case of ""just for a few"", were mere mortals like me are unable to drive, while in the hands of a talented driver these cars become real beasts. They simply feel awful. I don't know, it just feels too wrong to me.  But thanks for the tips, bro."

I agree the hillclimb cars are pretty impossible with a controller. I suspect the issue is that the cars need that extra finess with the wheel due to the high power/large brakes/low weight combination."

Im glad you added both tarmac and mixed pikes peak as it really adds some spice to it. Now, if we just had downhill/reverse too!  There are a few things ive continued to notice that i hope CM can look into fixing soon. 1. The cars in this game are just too slow! When i play RBR and use a WRC car, i feel scared to hold it wide open! Its hilariously fun because these cars are fast! It almost gives the sensation that you are really driving, becuase you literally are afraid to go full out! This is missing in DiRT Rally because the cars are just too slow! I want accurate, and maybe RBRs cars are on the side of being too fast, but this is something needs to be adjusted in Dirt Rally imo.  2. The cars in DiRT Rally still don't slide quite enough (especially in Greece). The game is difficult in a good way, and feels almost as hard as RBR, but the cars just have too much lateral grip, so when you get them out of shape the speed srubs off so fast. This goes back to the car's power output as well. 3. The braking is too easy. There is no locking up brakes (at least i haven't noticed) and if anything you can just stab the brakes and let the car do its thing. You should be able to lock up without abs, especially in loose gravel! 4. The car setups need some tweaking and it would be nice to have a decent default gravel and tarmac setup since they need to be so different. 5. The codriver needs some work. A lot of calls are just wrong, some are bugged, some just come too late not matter if you have him set on earlier or not. 6. The FFB (i know, but really hope you can get it right, and fast)! 7. Need tire compound/type options so we can decide what tires we want. Also, need tire pressure adjustments to cars. 8. Pikes Peak cars need wing adjustment. 9. It would be nice if we saw what upgrades were on the car on the setup screen and on score screens. 10. The ability to limit users in your leagues to certain aids/views/etc.  Thanks!"

I really think that being able to run group A at least up Pikes is necessary. It is an existing class and might teach people limits better. My concern is that the physics model between rally and hillclimb are utterly different, which might explain the separation - but I hope not. People may not be okay with a car revlimiting at spots."

Why can't I bind all controls to whatever input I desire? Including menu buttons.  Not to mention trying to get the game to recognize that yes, I have enough inputs to use h pattern with clutch, but can't select it in my profile! Why does it need to be selected all the way over in the profile anyway? So aggravating.  I've wasted hours and hours trying to get controls set up correctly, it's just a nightmare.

Hillclimb cars feel really difficult to keep on the road. Obviously I've never driven any but comparing the handling of these to other cars it feels they spin out far too easily, even when playing with a wheel and being careful. I guess this'll take a lot of getting used to but it just feels off to me.   What do you love the most in the Pikes Peak Update?   It feels like a different game entirely. The cars handle completely different, everything's twice as fast, lack of co-driver and more open roads is just a different experience. It'll take some time to learn it but it's fun nonetheless.   Was it easy to find out what we'd added?   How's this question different from the 1st?   Did you watch this week's DiRT Show? What did you think?   Tuned in a little late, but still watched.

dirtgame,37lnaq,True_Racer,3,Thu May 28 15:01:40 2015 UTC,"Fanatec GT2 Settings with swift, clear FFB and a dancy style of rallying  Thought I'd share my current settings as I see some people have trouble finding a nice feedback from this gem of a rally experience. And I think I've found a very fluid and still clear combination of settings.      FIRST OF ALL Right now at least I have to open the game menu when the race is about to start and close it again; and this is to get rid of a bug or something that cause the steering to be super twitchy unless you do this. It's like the steering saturation is very high after loading the event until you just open and close the menu that seem to recall the correct settings...      ON WHEEL SETTINGS  Sensitivity: 540  Force Feedback Strength: 100  FFB Shock Effects: 80-100  Drift setting: 5  ABS OFF  Linearity 0  Deadzone 0  Spring -4  Damper OFF      IN GAME SETTINGS Deadzones on zero, linearity 0, saturation at 100  VIBRATION & FEEDBACK  Vibration Strength 90  Wheel Strength 40-70 depending on surface, 40 is very nice in greece  Wheel weight 20% (or higher on asphalt with fwd cars)  ANOTHER NOTE This is also the first racing game where I've had more success using vsync at 59 fps stable instead of free fps that seem to just feel stuttery on my rig. But sometimes I have to switch the sync off and on again to slap the game out of thinking I want to sync 25fps instead of 59...      MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH This is an edit I found that floats around in the community with a much better setting than default (april 30) FFB.   Open the steam game folder and then forcefeedback/effectsetup.xml to edit in notepad.  Select all in this text file and paste below text instead.

It would be nice if they had some better default gravel and tarmac sets, but i don't want perfect sets because that gives the hardcore fans more to work on to achieve a perfect setup. One thing that is missing from the setups (other than selecting tire compound based on conditions) is tire pressure.

Some guy wrote a program that evaluated your FFB during a lap and determined if your settings were clipping the FFB motor. You'd then dial back the settings until you weren't clipping and got a more realistic, although softer, FFB output.  I wonder if that program works for Dirt: Rally?  This is an article on FFB clipping: http://www.racedepartment.com/threads/like-your-ffb-strong-think-again.30763/"
dirtgame,37hrer,mrvile,3,Wed May 27 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"That is the principle behind getting rid of the static wheel weight, basically to stop it from overriding all other effects. What i meant by saturation is just that, clipping. But yeah, a clipping indicator would be nice, since now you have to do it by feel. Still I would wait until the proper FFB overhaul, since we're still lacking some dynamics. Especially a proper caster effect when the car is sliding."

I know you save the car's motions and whatnot into some sort of buffer file and the replay feature plays THAT back. That's how we can choose what camera angle to use and so on.   What I really want is some sort of a ""timeline"" feature where we choose what camera to use at a particular moment. Like for this corner, I want a ""drive-by"", here I want a ""drone overfly"", there I want a road cam with dirt splashed on it, here I want interior shot... etc.    You can limit it to no more than 3 camera flips every X seconds, or limit the total camera changes per race.   Would be REALLY cool if you can also add in ""telemetry"" overlays like simulated throttle/brake movements, G-meters, simulated PIP (course map in a corner, in window or overlay), and so on.

For the longest time I've just plugged it in and voilá; has worked in every racing game so far but this particular wheel might be the ""newest"" one of the series, don't really know.

dirtgame,37h3f1,Emperalhero,1 point,Thu May 28 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say stick with the drift setting at five for a few stages as you will get a hang of just tossing the wheel around with your fingers and be able to keep the car balanced through long corners. It's kind of the point of this ""build"" to get that help with a fast wheel.   Try upping wheel weight in the FFB settings instead to get more resistance, and lower the steering range a little bit to further the center feel.   And yes I'm using the clubsport handbrake too.

dirtgame,37h1l6,jay_p_666,7,Wed May 27 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"You do realize the speeds are almost double the rally speeds we've been used to? I haven't driven a car past 160kph in a straight line, but at a slide I'd think it'd go pretty fast to the trees. Same applies to circuit racing from what I've seen; one car loses grip (at about the same speeds here) and it's pretty much on the grass/sand, guaranteed. When running 6th gear and at the redline with the Quattro at 225kph, it feels fast. This might be a subjective opinion but as said in this thread, the roads are about twice the width than in the rally stages so it might skew the perspective a bit. In that case you are going too slow. I've been able to do pretty much perfect hairpins on tarmac, most of the time better than on the Monaco rallies. I don't see a problem. Spool up time for the turbo does that. When it kicks in (and actually delivers the HP in question) it rockets. And have you launched with the handbrake? Because I can launch with a stock Quattro on the second gear easily and achieve a higher speed at the start line than by ""normal"" launch from first. Too powerful braking then, simple as that. Lower braking power, even the ratio or brake earlier and more tenderly. I've never had a problem unless I noticed that I simply started braking too late and thus locking the wheels in slight panic. Losing control at 150kph is pretty much unrecoverable, thus you need to be smooth in everything in Pikes Peak.   Imo this pack is awesome. It's a challenge to drive up without any sense of direction except the road in front of you and instincts at 150kph."
dirtgame,37h1l6,QazRa,1 point,Wed May 27 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't change the fact all these problems are not in RBR. Maybe sense of speed is a FOV issue?! I can have easily a good approximation in RBR of how fast the car is going even at 160kph and start braking 70 feet ahead then pushing handbrake and start sliding even before entering the turn, and continue drifting smoothly to the next corner. It's lot more fun and satisfying than DR. Don't know what they're thinking by trying to make something different, why changing something perfect? They should just try to make it like RBR and they will make a lot of fans happy. RBR is still the King when it comes to accurate rally simulator!!"
dirtgame,37h1l6,Raptord,2,Wed May 27 23:52:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that the cars don't feel quite right, however it's normal to have very little torque in a car with a big turbo and a small engine such as these when you aren't in the engine's power band.  Also, I don't know about the Peugot's, but the Quattro takes ages to change gears (using manual sequential, no clutch)."
dirtgame,37h1l6,xdeific,2,Wed May 27 16:27:39 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of your points, I will add that they added the ability to use the ""advanced"" car setup on any car (outside of career mode). I was able to minimize or get rid of a lot of the problems with car setup adjustments.  I think a lot of it is getting used to 600hp in only 2000lbs of car."
dirtgame,37h1l6,Murfenator,2,Wed May 27 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't played pikes peak too much yet, but in general i agree. Its unfortunate, but i think this update actually made the game worse overall, as it revealed more of the gamey undertones that CM has in place (that we all just kinda ignored on Monte Carlo). This content feels extremely rushed and i hope the rest of the development doesnt tend this way. I will say that Pikes Peak itself is pretty great, but the cars they added, and how they drive (physics) is the worst part of the game so far..."
dirtgame,37h1l6,kalabaleek,2,Wed May 27 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"Car selection is perfect to me, I guess it's a matter of personal choice.

Three, because of the nature of loose surface rallying, and the propensity to be quite sideways, quite often, the cars are set up with a little understeer to keep the car controllable, and make it easier to recover from larger drifts, and steep drift angles. Four, if you have never worked with a hydraulic handbrake, you will pull it and almost swap ends immediately. The hand brake is not an instant drift handle. It requires set up, proper weight shift, and excellent timing.  In other words, while the simulation engine has a ways to go, and isn't perfect, it gets far more right than it does wrong. RBR felt right, because there was a steep learning curve, and physics that made sense to pick up and experiment with.  My only complaint with Dirt is that the graphics engine, and the way it renders stuff still feels like its not taking itself seriously. It feels like an arcade game in look, and not a more serious game of realism like GT or Forza, or AC. For example, I think the same thing happens with the F1 codies games as well, they just don't look real to me, despite how well put together the whole product may be."
dirtgame,37fcbr,Buck-O,3,Wed May 27 08:33:56 2015 UTC,"So I am not going to claim to be an ace rally driver, but I have spent a fair amount of time doing autoX, rallyX, rally school, and general mucking about, and neither DiRT or RBR really nail the feeling.  That being said RBR feels more right IMO.  It is a little too slippery feeling and the tarmac is... strange feeling.  But the cars respond like I feel they should to driver inputs.  Get on the brakes and the back gets light (left foot braking).  Flicking into turns feels better too.  Dirt on the other hand feels really planted in the handling department with a very narrow almost binary level of grip where either you have tarmac levels of grip or you are driving on dog snot covered teflon.  Left foot braking in DiRT seems to behave as an e brake type action (reinforced by when you move your brake bias to the rear it works better) than as a weight transfer maneuver.  Also the sliding in DiRT just doesn't quite feel right, it might be a FFB issue but it just isn't there yet IMO.  All that being said, I have high hopes for DiRT.  I think that CM can pull it off if they want, and they have been making the right sounds and gestures.  Here is hoping that they pull it off."
dirtgame,37fcbr,deadstump,1 point,Wed May 27 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"That's what I am talking about, the tarmac feels almost more like driving in GTAV if you will. Not quite as bad, but where you can be going really fast, pull the ebrake, car spins out easily and stops sooo quick in a slide. Then it's bogged down and hard to get going again. Now, I do not have any experience with rally.. so I am not a fair judge as far as what feels the best, but I can tell its not fully there."
dirtgame,37fcbr,snoozieboi,1 point,Thu May 28 08:01:11 2015 UTC,"I actually have no experience with rally. The only thing I've ever done is one time my buddy let me slide his A4 Quattro around some DiRT trails around by me. So nothing really. And as far as my e-brake, I only have the capability of mapping it to a button on my wheel right now :( So its all or nothing for me. I know that has a major part of the spinning, so I try and tap it in bursts. But all in all, I know I can't claim how the best would be, but I think there is still something fishy. But it is in beta, and I still play almost every day! :D"
dirtgame,37fcbr,dgeesio,3,Thu May 28 08:05:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to hear the words of that rally driver whom is helping CM on the inside.  My dream would be that they secretly tracked down the guys from Warthog behind RBR physics. No need to reinvent the wheel. Have a brainstorm, play RBR and Dirt.    Without RBR... man, I wouldn't want to think about a world without RBR."
dirtgame,37fcbr,_Bilas,2,Wed May 27 14:35:45 2015 UTC,in hillclimb the auto gears feel like they are broken.always over revving. 11 mins of pure pain listening to that.  i see they are trying to make hillclimb hard on pikes but the cars could do with a little tweak . understeer far to easy.sliding very bad on tarmac.worse than ice. how can they slide worse than on ice ? that is wrong.
dirtgame,37fcbr,Francoberry,2,Wed May 27 09:35:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, I only have experience with the new 405, but holy shit you can't get that thing to be neutral in mid->fast speed turns. Could be the copious amounts of rear downforce from that car... but it still feels like you have to do some drastic things to make it oversteer."
dirtgame,37fcbr,Murfenator,1 point,Wed May 27 06:15:03 2015 UTC,"as soon as i brake it suddenly goes into wild, uncontrollable oversteer too! I'm really not great at this sim, but with this handling combined with the fact that force feedback doesn't give any indication of what the car is doing, I'm having a really hard time trying to drive anywhere"
dirtgame,37fcbr,h_rsrbr,2,Wed May 27 07:22:59 2015 UTC,"First off, I kind of agree, this game has some very Codemaster ""under the hood"" assists feeling, like in other Codemaster games. While it is pretty solid in some sense, you don't get a good sense of each tire on the ground, but more of just pivoting the CG of the mass of the vehicle. The handbrake has a bit of a ""gamey"" feel to me as well. However, some of the issues you bring up should be addressed (or you can address it when you play more). First, the FFB is being redone, and i think it should provide a lot better experience when it is fixed. Second, gearing, diff and overall balance is probably more of an issue with the car setup. Gearing can be easily addressed in the advanced setup, as well as diff controls to setup oversteer/understeer. Give it some more time, but i do agree that its not the level of RBR, it still gives me a good stage experience though, and it looks/sounds amazing compared to RBR..."
dirtgame,37fcbr,Thuraash,1 point,Wed May 27 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"This. You do not get a sense of all 4 wheels on the ground. It does feel like its pivoting around the center of gravity. Or even as if the game engine drew one point right where the natural pivot point of the car would be, and that's the only thing touching the ground as far as the coding goes. So it just pivots around that point, and the wheels are all just for show lol."
dirtgame,37fcbr,h_rsrbr,0,Thu May 28 08:29:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, It's not even about not enough content, because we know it will come. But the feeling when driving most cars is quite plasticky. I could live with the ffb as it is now, but cars need to response for my action. I'm playing RSRBR for quite a long time and coming from that into Dirt Rally is not easy. For example when I'm approiching a hairpin I don't want the car to turn for me and I feel that when I turn the weel a little the script goes on an tries to do the rest."
dirtgame,37fcbr,wartzilla,2,Wed May 27 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's no scripted behavior at work there. It's probably a combination of road bank angle, slight tendency towards instability under breaking, and you naturally correcting that instability through turning the wheel a bit to set you up for the turn."
dirtgame,37fcbr,najtrows,1 point,Wed May 27 07:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware that road camber can naturally steer the car a little. Maybe it should be like that, but all I can compare it with is RBR and there is no such thing there.  Anyway I know that Codemasters listen to the community and I hope they will go with the game in the right direction."
dirtgame,37ftyp,joelperkins93,3,Wed May 27 09:15:18 2015 UTC,"Rally Cars on Pikes Peak are coming, they said so in the latest Dirt Show.  They're just going to tinker with the downforce or whatever it was first."
dirtgame,37ftyp,ZchmeKko,2,Wed May 27 11:17:39 2015 UTC,"1: I'm not entirely sure whether it was fully gravel/dirt, ever. It was partially paved for a long time and then they fully paved it over fairly recently.  2: I'm pretty sure hillclimb cars are specifically designed to go up hills. Most of the regular rally cars are designed for uneven surfaces. It's like taking waders to a footrace. As nice as it would probably be to take regular cars, they wouldn't be anywhere near as good at doing it.  3: You can always alter the setups of the cars. I've personally found them to be very stable though I've not done much with the hillclimb just yet. The 205 is supposed to be an almost uncontrollable handful.  Edit: Formatting went mad!"
dirtgame,37ftyp,ExpletiveBanana,3,Wed May 27 09:43:35 2015 UTC,"PP in the 80s was still dirt, when these cars ran.  A lot of the group b cars ended up running PP after the ban"

Haven't played around enough with altering setup but i'm assuming it wont be too hard to get them at least stable under brakes  I still think 2 is valid though, heaps of people run in their less powerful cars every year. Might be no where near as quick as the hill climb ones, but if they're already in the game then I don't see why they shouldn't be available?"
dirtgame,37ftyp,ExpletiveBanana,2,Wed May 27 09:55:58 2015 UTC,Can you imagine driving it in a Lancia Fulvia? It'd take you about an hour.

dirtgame,37bloa,justbiglee,4,Tue May 26 12:45:34 2015 UTC,Will we get live rally beside these leagues? I mean like rallying in same session where you have to wait/watch others to finish their special stage. Or going like 30 seconds after and see if someone crashed ahead... That would be cool and add more immersion.

This was very apparent for me when there was fulvia daily, i didnt own it and did 43 seconds slower than the leader with good, clean drive. I decided to buy it and try once i got it upgraded, and first run not 100% clean i was just 10 seconds slower, and believe there were easily 10 seconds to be faster.

dirtgame,37d8lj,Stealthbmxer,6,Tue May 26 19:50:20 2015 UTC,Why don't you just drive from the dash view?  You already have a very highly rendered wheel and set of hands in front of the monitor and it is like driving from the back seat with six foot arms driving from the wheel view.
dirtgame,37d8lj,deadstump,4,Tue May 26 21:06:20 2015 UTC,I do that but i wanted the input lag to be seen better
dirtgame,37d8lj,deadstump,6,Tue May 26 21:09:09 2015 UTC,From my experience it seems like the input lag is limited to the hands on the wheel and not how the car behaves.  I think that the view is damped to prevent twitching from controller twitch so it takes a little time to respond to fast motions since it is worried that it is just an input spike.  Also I would imagine that it also has to do with the legacy of controller use where if someone was using a binary controller (the D pad) the hands wouldn't just be teleporting from lock to lock.

I used to like shifting up at certain times but now I have to just judge what's right. It's just a little confusing cause it's not written in the patch update notes.
dirtgame,37bq3t,Weerm,4,Tue May 26 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"For me it is like this.  I less look at the tachometer than hear the motor.  There is a happy range up near redline where you want to keep the revs.  Learn what the bottom of that range is and if the pitch is lower than you downshift.  If you are up at redline you upshift.    It takes a little while to feel this out, but eventually you will hear a note call/see a corner and when you are familiar enough with the car you will know approximately what gear you need to be in (how fast) to go around that corner, so you downshift as you are slowing down into the correct gear that way when you get off the brakes you are in the right gear and there is no need to think about it in the corner... unless you guessed wrong and you need to change, but this happens less once you get the feel for it.  For me, my general rule of thumb in DiRT so far is 1st for hairpins or acute, 2nd for open hairpins thru 2's, then more or less the gear should match the corner call.  The notes are not set up this way 100%, but it is a good rule of thumb.  Also it should be noted that this is the HIGHEST gear you should be in for the corner, if you are not to that gear yet then just continue in the gear you are already in.  Sorry I have rambled.  Let me know if you have any more specific questions."
dirtgame,37bq3t,deadstump,2,Tue May 26 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"As soon as I saw controls for controller I rebound them to the bumpers, left for down and right for up, then I just use two fingers on each side with the middle fingers as the throttle. This setup works for me but if you find something different more power to you."
dirtgame,37bq3t,Acemaster25,1 point,Tue May 26 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"This really helped and I'm working my way up with no assists. Thanks! I skip using two fingers for down-gear and brake though, works great."
dirtgame,37bq3t,Th3HolyMoose,2,Fri Jun 5 18:13:15 2015 UTC,"As Acemaster25 said, rebind gear up to the right bumper and gear down to the left bumper, this way you dont need to angle your hand awkwardly to shift gears, and it makes shifting up just as quick as shifting down without moving your hands. It might also get you used to paddles if you get a wheel later on, think it helped me. And really with shifting in Rally, you will just automatically shift down after a while, and shifting up is easy, you hear the engine and you see the rev limiter warning"
dirtgame,37cgdo,ZioYuri78,3,Tue May 26 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"That's how it's supposed to work. A tachometer measures the RPM (Rotations Per Minute) of the crankshaft of the engine, the higher the engine revs, the faster the crank spins, and the higher the RPM.  The other device you seem to be thinking of its a speedometer, this is a device that measures the speed of the car. If you look at the dash some vehicles have no speedometer or it's a digital display rather than analog gauge."
dirtgame,37cgdo,TDawg_603,2,Tue May 26 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my fault in the title, i mean the speedometer, after the today patch i played with Mini Cooper and looks lake work strange, i will try with other cars."

dirtgame,37a353,ExpletiveBanana,1 point,Tue May 26 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"Just get used to how the car handles through the different stages all the while memorizing where the pacenotes are wrong. Then as your car gets upgraded and you learn the stages, make adjustments to the setup of the car. By the time you get the car where you want it you should be winning stages.   As for the sense of accomplishment, it really is a great feeling when you take home some wins."
dirtgame,37a353,Crushker,0,Tue May 26 04:41:26 2015 UTC,"I think this is a bit of an issue with rally games after 15+ hours of play they all turn into hill climb/special stage games.   So unless some ridiculous procedural system can be invented (other than for the sake of having a single player for a retail product) In my opinion It would be better for more players if there was a content focus on hill climb and special stages.    Pribam for RBR for example I felt was a perfect for this situation as it still captures many aspects of rally, is significantly different to track racing but does not pretend to be a rally stage."
dirtgame,37a353,gamermusclevideos,2,Tue May 26 09:59:15 2015 UTC,"Really good point.  We drive our favourite stages vastly more times than professional rally drivers do.    I'd hate to say goodbye to traditional stages entirely, although your conclusion follows logically from your premises.  I guess I can dream of a procedural system in the future."
dirtgame,37a353,jtr99,2,Tue May 26 10:16:39 2015 UTC,"I dont think hillclimb is the way to go, but rather modding support for tracks. And preferably in a format which can take some use of rbr mod tracks, so those can be converted over for starters before original dirt rally mod tracks will come. That would ensure a big library of rally stages and you wouldn't remember too many of them."
dirtgame,37a353,gheeDi,1 point,Tue May 26 10:22:04 2015 UTC,"People have been playing them for so long they are effectively hill climb/special stages already.  I don't think Codemasters are that big on mod support, guess it comes down to licences with their engine technologies, asset pipeline as well as other aspects of game design and content integration.   I could see that Codemasters may also be worried that if they release mod tools for Dirt they will be increasing the amount of content that's already ripped from there other games."
dirtgame,37a353,gamermusclevideos,1 point,Tue May 26 10:35:45 2015 UTC,"Apart from the most hardcore rbr fans who've played it and the mods since beginning, i dont think so. There are so many big stages, that i dont think you will ever just ""remember"" them.   When it comes to modding support i don't know and couldnt guess codemasters stance on it, but if fans are enthusiastic enough they will break it open and mod it. Even dirt 3 has a physics mod to make it more realistic. In my opinion they shouldn't fight against mods or ignore them, but rather embrace it and make it painless.  Regarding ripped content... I strongly believe the good of modding outweighs the bad, and shouldn't discourage them from doing mod support."
dirtgame,37a353,gheeDi,1 point,Tue May 26 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't wish to push that mindset on people, but I've found it better for me to just use the pacenotes as suggestions. The setups I'm building for my cars are way off from what the pacenotes usually dictate for me."
dirtgame,37a353,Crushker,1 point,Tue May 26 10:35:39 2015 UTC,"The obvious solution is for Codemasters to give out a skype number, you then do a conference call and they co drive for you :)   Short of that I feel the only solution might be to employ this Co driver  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FymE2Vu-7lc  until then Dirt will always lack authenticity as a rally title."

dirtgame,377gaw,Dustygrrl,1 point,Tue May 26 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"I can't answer this 100% for sure, but my best guess is that they're a manufacturer team.  Since they produce the cars and a lot of the parts that they'd need to replace, it would be much cheaper than buying them.  The team has a lot more resources and a lot more money to invest into the cars so they're trying to even the playing field for smaller teams that aren't manufacturer teams."

You sacrifice your exit speed for a fast entry, which I think slows you down on average. You're also going wider than my Escort in almost every corner, you might want to keep your butt in check.

dirtgame,378hjc,dromtrund,6,Mon May 25 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"I know it wasn't perfect, but that run is 104th on the leader board for that stage if I'm understanding correctly. That should be enough to win on the lowest difficulty."
dirtgame,378hjc,itsCrisp,3,Mon May 25 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. I've had some trials and tribulations with the AI as well, but what can you do. In the last championship I raced, I was podium finishing every race until I got to the last in the series, in which I finished 7th, while the 1st and 2nd place AI were a whopping 1:45 ahead of me. Even when I ran a restart and managed a near flawless run (or at the very least as fast as I could possibly drive), I could only pull myself up to fourth, with the AI still 30s ahead of me."
dirtgame,378hjc,hvyboots,3,Mon May 25 22:09:31 2015 UTC,"From watching some guy on Twitch, apparently you need a lot of upgrades to get competitive too. If it's a new car with no upgrades, that may be an issue you're having."

dirtgame,378hjc,iktnl,1 point,Mon May 25 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Upgrades make a huge diffrence, it is very hard to even win a race without them because the AI times are based on fully upgrade cars (i guess). But also the AI times are very unconsistent and random, something they maybe fixed in the new patch today. Also from now on you get fully upgrade cars when you play custom events!  ""Sent all our AI drivers back to rally school, turns out they were struggling to keep up with you guys so expect a bit more of a challenge from now on"""
dirtgame,378hjc,optimatorz,2,Tue May 26 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"I just did a 3:10 on that with the same car, lost by 15s, on Open difficulty.  I would've won this at Professional in the '60s Mini, so the AI needs some recalculation.  That said, I could win about 15 seconds after a few times of practice, and probably over 20 if I didn't use a controller. It should be doable, but it's not ""Open"" difficulty no."
dirtgame,378hjc,Razzeus,1 point,Mon May 25 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"My time was 2:56.9xx.  The AI seems to do around 2:55 pretty consistently on Open difficulty which is absurd.  I've been practicing this stage today in various cars, I just did around a 3:13 using the 60s Mini.  The amount of time I went without letting off at all was crazy.  I also play using a controller.  I need a wheel."

For example, the current event for my league (which is the second event of the season), can be found at:  https://www.dirtgame.com/uk/api/event?eventId=3059&leaderboard=true&noCache=1432523769250&page=1&stageId=0  That returns some JSON data that can then be parsed/used however you feel fit.  I can get the previous results by changing the ID to 3058:  https://www.dirtgame.com/uk/api/event?eventId=3058&leaderboard=true&noCache=1432523769250&page=1&stageId=0  If you want the times for the individual stages just change the stageId to 1, 2, 3, etc."
dirtgame,37492h,forceh,2,Mon May 25 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"Nice finding, thanks!  Do you know something to calculate stage times automatically, if I insert the cumulative time after every stage?"
dirtgame,37492h,spinado,3,Mon May 25 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"As a matter of fact, I do. I convert the cumulative times into ticks (milliseconds) and then use that to figure things out.  I wrote a PHP database insert thingy to figure out everything for me but I use the following calculation:  Make sure you convert hours into minutes, so 1hr 11mins becomes 71mins, etc.   ((((MINUTES * 60) + SECONDS) * 1000) + MILLISECONDS);   So for example, lets try and figure out the time for stage 4. To do this we need the cumulative time for both stage 4 and stage 3.  Stage 4 cumulative time: 11:50.231 (710231 ticks) Stage 3 cumulative time: 06:22.842 (382842 ticks)  Now that we know this, we subtract the stage 3 time from the stage 4 time.   (710231 - 382842)   This will then give us the actual time for stage 4 which is:   327389 ticks (milliseconds) 05:27.389   Hope that helps!"

The hands don't look too bad IMO but I can see how if you were using a controller or even a wheel but still using the first person perspective.

dirtgame,37107i,Raptord,2,Sun May 24 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"Great point. Added, and added the negative camber designation."
dirtgame,37107i,Pr0fil3,2,Sun May 24 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"The reason cars always have a brake bias favoured to the front is because of weight transfer. When you brake, a lot of weight transfers to the front tyres, making them more grippy. For a FF car, the bias is even more towards the front because there's already a lot of weight on the front axle because the engine is hanging on it. So, layout is also important to determine the right brake balance.   For the gearing section:  Always rev your car out to redline, even turbocharged cars. This is because in a relatively lower gear, there will still be more torque going through the drive axle than when in a gear up, even though the engine produces more power. In a low gear, you will measure a lot of torque through the drive axle, because you multiply engine power by the gear ratios. So for each higher gear you go, (if your engine always made the same power) less torque will go through the drive axle."
dirtgame,37107i,CountAntonius,1 point,Sun May 24 09:35:45 2015 UTC,"Re: Brake bias. Definitely good to mention something about weight distribution for the brake bias section. A MR car like the Lancia Stratos would need less front brake bias for example.  Re: gearing; I don't think reving the car to redline is actually recommended on all cars... shouldn't you be trying to maximize the area under the curve? So in cases where the power and especially the torque drop off drastically near the redline, wouldn't you want to shift earlier?"
dirtgame,37107i,afantail,1 point,Sun May 24 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"You are very right, buy I don't think rally cars like these lose significant power near the redline. I haven't seen any charts on engine torque and power though."

The Audi and RS200 felt too slide-able for me and I probably would have crashed a lot more with them, but I didn't tune anything yet."

dirtgame,36wdfa,justbiglee,4,Fri May 22 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"The game : 8/10, It's a solid basis and it could easily grow to a 9 with more cars/tracks/features. I'm pretty sure it would deserve a 9 just with the hillclimb update coming up. The handling : 8/10, It's precise and offers a challenge. There are some times where cars are feeling light, they seem to get a lot of flying time in a crash, but it's nothing too bad. It's been to long since I've played a good rally game so I'm not gonna compare it to something else. (Playing with an Xbox360 controller) The Online Events : 7/10, they are pretty good, of course they would be better with some more variety, which will come along with content updates. I would like to get more cash out of the dailies though, rewards are a bit slim in general. The League Support : I can't comment as I've not tried that yet. Social Channels : 8/10, good reddit usage, active (and quite funny) twitter, youtube videos that made me all wet looking at the car list (and sad, as I know it's not a defenitive wishlist). I would really like to see ""concrete"" stuff : dates for the updates, renders of cars we are going to get next, ... etc ... The Website : 5/10, would love to see ""concrete"" stuff as well, and I have to boot up internet explorer each time I wanna have a look, not fun. Handling of Bugs : 5/10, I can't really say I've had a lot except the infamous error 41, had hell of a time finding any info on it, ended up cleaning around my C: drive (which is a low-capacity SSD), it seemed to do the trick. (having less than 4-5 Go of free space on the system drive seems to make me get the error, hope it helps) Suggestions : 7/10, it's good to know you are there and listenning, I guess there will be more to talk about this topic when we'll be a couple of updates in, see if the suggestions are implemented. How easy is it to talk to you : 9/10, pretty easy is the answer. How involved do I feel : 7/10, again, let's see about it a couple of updates in, as for now at least, I know if an idea comes to mind, it will not be unanswered. This subreddit : 7/10, pretty much the same comment as the social channels.    I hope this will be a tiny bit useful, your game and its subreddit made me (finally) create a reddit account. :)  EDIT : Added what controller I'm using to clarify my view on Handling."
dirtgame,36wdfa,Babz03,2,Fri May 22 18:24:35 2015 UTC,"Subject Score    The Game 7+   The handling 7   The Online Events 8   The League Support 7   Our Social Channels 6   The Website 6   How we handle bugs 8   How we handle suggestions 8   How easy are we to talk to? 10   How involved in the development of DiRT do you feel? 7   This Subreddit 8    If anyone wants to use this format you can open the source and copy it and replace my numbers with yours.   The Game is getting there and I like the direction you are going!  Keep it up The Handling doesn't feel right yet.  It doesn't feel like the driver inputs move the weight around to the individual wheels.  Really affects the feeling of Left Foot Braking and flicking into turns.  I also think that the lackluster force feedback is hampering how I feel the cars.  It is difficult to react correctly to the way the car is behaving when you cannot really feel how the car is behaving. The online events are good as far as I can tell, but I would like it if there were someway not to get straight buried if you were not in the top 50 Leagues are cool.  I would like some more options like forced cameras, damage controls, point payout schemes (if you have a large league only the top 10 gets points and it really leaves out a lot of people and doesn't allow the lower ranked drivers to compare how they are doing to their peers... I have some ideas on how to address this and if you would like I can go into it further). Website is good, not amazing, but solid.  Apparently some people are still having trouble with firefox.  Also is there a web version?  It would be sweet to be able to manage leagues from my phone. Bug handling.  It is a little opaque, but that is probably good.  Stuff seems to get fixed fairly well. Suggestions.  I feel that you could could really use a better suggestion box than the steam one.  There things just pile up and seem to get lost in the pile where they are repeated and diluted.  It kind of feels like spitting in the ocean.  It would be cool if there was some sort of table where users could add items and endorse other ideas that have already been suggested, and if a redundant suggestion gets added it could be added as an endorsement of the idea.  It would be good to have a discussion board attached to each idea so that details can be hashed out.  It would also be nice to be able to sort the table by type (stages, cars, game modes, etc.) so that you could look for ideas without digging through a huge stack of unrelated things. Easy to talk to?  Yea, you seem fairly easy to talk to and I think posts like this are a big help. How involved do I feel?  I really think that you are actively reading these responses, and I only ranked you a 7 for this because I haven't seen too many of the ideas come out in the wash.  I expect that is just because you are working on them. This subreddit is good.  The top bar is a little wonky for some reason.  It is difficult to click on my profile from your page and your ""DiRT rally"" logo in the top left is a little squished looking, but other than that it is all good.   Sorry for writing such a book, I am just excited about your game.  Keep up the good work."
dirtgame,36wdfa,deadstump,1 point,Fri May 22 18:30:09 2015 UTC,"The Game (8/10)  I have a blast with this game. I get the same adrenaline rush playing this game that I get driving my real life car through twisty fun roads. The visuals are fantastic, I can taste the dust in my mouth driving on the Greek stages. The AI difficulty is annoying, seemingly super-human, and makes it hard (for me anyways) to feel like I ever have a shot of winning a stage, much less an event or championship. I've yet to go back down to the lower levels and test myself though. My only other real complaint is the time it takes to get into and out of reverse gear in the manual sequential gearbox. Takes way too long. Why is neutral even an option for a gear when using a controller?  The Handling (7/10)  Cars seem to handle well in dirt. Handling on tarmac seems... off. Once the car is in the air the physics seem much less realistic, which is super annoying when you roll or whatever. But in the dirt the cars feel great to me. The Subaru Impreza handling really reminds me of how my obviously-not-comparable '05 Impreza RS handled in the dirt. It's super cool to be able to take existing knowledge/skills and apply it to a virtual car and it behaves like I remember it to. The mark of a good sim, IMO.  Online Events/League/Social  Haven't done much of this so I won't bother rating it. Seems good though. An alert that you have unclaimed credits from finished events would be nice, I had a few thousand waiting for me I had no idea about until I went to check the online events one day.  How involved in the development of DiRT do you feel? (7/10)  You're very responsive to some things. Having the content timeline already mapped out isn't necessarily a negative, in fact it's nice to know there's a plan, but it does make content suggestions seem a little pointless. Also: please give us map tools. I don't care how complicated they are, I can make my way around a game engine--I just want to put some of my ideas into the game to see how it plays and stuff, and I know others do too.  This Subreddit (10/10)  It's hard to screw this one up, I think, especially since we're not drowning in posts here so there's not a huge need for someone to cut out and remove crap posts (if there ever are any)."

Its got decent content and the foundation is pretty solid imo. However, several of the items listed here i don't think can really be graded until we see how patches and content come in. If we get a patch pretty soon that fixes FFB, engine braking, too much grip, AI speeds, volume issues, better wheel settings and better pacenote timings, then the response from the team would imo be excellent! If all we get is new content for the next 3-6 months without any real fixes to the main issues, then it will be like most other early access games and frustrating for us (i understand new content needs to be implemented as well). Overall, i like what ive seen from you guys though, and you seem to have a good interest in making this game great, so thats exciting. I also already very much enjoy driving it, and have trouble putting it down, that says a lot!"
dirtgame,36wdfa,Murfenator,1 point,Fri May 22 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"The Game   7/10: It is a great start and I enjoy it really a lot. Like a lot a lot. But if this was to be a full retail title, it'd be disappointing, so I'd like to see it moving forward.  The handling   5/10 It's ok. The different grip levels in game are noticable and you have to adjust to them, but it's hard to do with FFB in its current form. It is by far the weakest point in the game.  The Online Events   8/10 They are simply good. A nice challenge.  The League Support   8/10 I like that the leagues are accessable from your site (though more on that later) and the game (indirectly). It all works as it should, but I'm sure others who use it more will give you better feedback on this.  Our Social Channels   10/10 I always liked the way you handle that stuff. Keep at it! (and that tweet to Forza, that had me in tears)  The Website   5/10 Doesn't work on Firefox and is a bit slow on Chrome. The layout is good. Easy to navigate.  How we handle bugs   Haven't seen any in my game, so I guess you're doing a good job with that.  How we handle suggestions   The fact this is a question means you do care about them, so that's a very nice thing. Though to judge this more time is needed to see if any/ how many make their way into the game.  How easy are we to talk to?   10/10 Your approach is outgoing and friendly (yes, that's CM's brief psychoanalysis). The fact you are active on places other than CM forums is fantastic.  How involved in the development of DiRT do you feel?   7/10 As a person I've not contributed more than the money for my copy, really.  But now with this survey I feel like you do want to know every single thought of every person who plays DiRT on the game. That makes me feel engaged in creating the game too!  This Subreddit   7/10 It looks decent (apart from the button today... it's kind of squished and stuff). People are nice, maybe it'd be nice if there was more of them. Especially in the league. 20+ at the end of this event isn't bad, but considering the sub has 1800 people, it suddenly looks a bit worse.  And since this is too small to ask for in a separate post: being able to move around the UI with a mouse would be awesome."

Cars, tracks, formats, which you guys have all laid out in an awesome timeline, just needs to be delivered.

The Online Events 7/10   Execution is good, again, it just needs more content to be varied enough for replayability. I like how the events vary, allowing you to choose between shorter and longer play sessions.    The League Support 6/10   The league system is cool but I wish there was a little bit more depth to it. It would be nice to have official seasons teams could compete in for prizes. League vs League comparisons would be interesting to see maybe. Maybe reward leagues for reaching certain milestones or being in the top ranks compared to other leagues.    Our Social Channels 8/10   Great, the communication is awesome. I wish there were more devs floating around answering questions but I understand the game needs more attention right now until release.   The Website 8/10   Good, though right now I don't have much use for it besides just joining leagues and blog posts. I would use the forums but since there this subreddit, it is much easier to use this since I use it for other communities constantly.    How we handle bugs 7/10   The bugs are being handled in good time but the small written list doesn't explain much or let players know how they're being prioritized. It would be cool to see a Trello board or something similar that gives some more details on the bugs.   How we handle suggestions 10/10   No complaints here.   How easy are we to talk to? 10/10   Very easy, constant communication.   How involved in the development of DiRT do you feel? 6/10   I feel somewhat involved, these threads are great. However, I feel like for perfect community involvement in post-release we need to be able to mod the game easily. Its a lot easier to edit the game ourselves and go ""Hey, we like this"" rather than have us try to explain it via forum posts. Right now a few xml tweaks (could be considered mods) can make huge difference in the gameplay, but there's no way to keep track of these tweaks. Even just a simple mods folder that the game checks at launch for modded files rather than having to overwrite the base game files would be great.   This Subreddit 10/10  Great, love the sub."

The League Support   7/10: Obviously its fantastic that it even exists, but not being able to see past events/seasons is kind of annoying, it doesn't feel like there's any persistence. It'd also be awesome if there was a way to see other people's replays somewhat easily (assuming the replay system is fit for being transferred like that)   Our Social Channels   7/10 The subreddit and twitter is great. Wish there were more streams but I know that's harder to set up and do. I should probably start idling in the IRC if the devs do.   The Website   6/10: I had a lot of problems getting my codemasters account connected to steam and set up in the first place, but now that I am it works fine (using Chrome). Even mobile does which surprised me.     How we handle bugs   7/10: I never had Error 41 so I'm happy, the response seemed fine.   How we handle suggestions   8/10: love the weekly suggestion/wish/feedback threads   How easy are we to talk to?   8/10 (10/10 relative to any AAA studio-publisher combo): Devs with the community in mind are super important for this kind of stuff, great to see.    How involved in the development of DiRT do you feel?   8/10: The weekly threads are a big part of this, and of course, this is an Early Access game. Of course there haven't been any major updates yet to tell how involved we actually are, but signs are good.   This Subreddit   8/10: Great subreddit though RES nightmode just seems to override it entirely. The sidebar is a nice resource."

Feeling like I can't get out of the next to easiest difficulty is not a fun place to be.  Running an online event and finishing 30 seconds back and then doing the same run in a Clubman and finishing 35 seconds back doesn't seem right.  The curve seems too steep.  As someone without a wealth of sim racing experience, no wheel, and a limited amount of gaming time I feel like I will never see the top tiers of this game. My time is now just wasted as I repeatedly run stages only to come up 11 seconds behind the leader and 4th overall.

I'll make some adjustments and try again though. There's definitely room for improvement on my end."
dirtgame,36y1m2,viper5699,2,Sat May 23 08:02:31 2015 UTC,"As the person who built the setup I just want to say a few things that might make a difference, I personally don't run the high/low gearing, I run alot more rear brake then Oggy, I prefer to run a 4 speed setup and keep the revs up at all times so I can keep it sideway at will (more throttle control). Also my wheel settings, I run a g27 with the typical 105/0/0/0 in profiler. In game I run 20% ffb, 0% vibration, and 0% wheel weight, 0 Linearity. My goal when building a setup is other then flicking the car into corner i try to keep the wheel as straight as possible at all times and just 4 wheel drift."
dirtgame,36y1m2,Case_f,1 point,Sat May 23 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"I switched the setting over to the Subaru as a test in my championship mode.

As for me, my settings are 126/121/100/99 With steering rotation at 518 (was like 450 in this video) My goal is generally the same for cornering as it should be but for some reason in this game I just can't trust the cars to slide through the corner before I have to turn out of it."
dirtgame,36y1m2,coffedrank,1 point,Sun May 24 08:07:23 2015 UTC,Firstly I think I figured it out towards the end as the first bit of the stage was kinda weak. With a bit of work I think I may be able to drive this thing.

dirtgame,36wa15,Agentofsociety,4,Fri May 22 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"Col de Turini descent is horrible. Mostly because of the codriver calls are timed entirely wrong in a few parts, partly because of missing calls. Some calls happen so fast, they still take 2-3 corners to get there, sometimes when you're on a straight on full throttle, the co-driver calls a 3 when you should've started breaking 10 meters ago.  But after 10 restarts or so I just know what to expect, but I suppose that's not how things are supposed to be played.  I quite enjoy Wales and Greece though, though Greece has some nasty spots where the road is small, though these are okay-ish to do."
dirtgame,36wa15,iktnl,1 point,Fri May 22 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"Do you ever notice that the co-driver will say like ""Right three"" and the sign on the HUD says right two?"
dirtgame,36wa15,NaughtyEwokCave,1 point,Fri May 22 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"Regularly, mostly in Wales, but there are a few on Monaco and Greece too. It first caught my attention when he said things like ""right 3, tightens to right 3"", when it's supposed to 4 tightens to 3, or 3 tightens to 2.  There are just some flat out bad calls too. I think there's a corner on Monaco that's a right 2 going in one direction, and a left 5 in the other. Until I learnt it, I was braking too much going in one direction, and smacking into the bank in the other."
dirtgame,36wa15,WordOfMadness,3,Sat May 23 01:25:42 2015 UTC,I really struggle on Greece due to the narrow sections and bumps/grooves in the track. I'm a beginner at racing/rally so just a couple days ago started tuning the cars instead of just using the default setups and found soften the dampeners helped me with the later complaint.

At first I hated it but now that I have some experience it can simultaneously be the most fun and frustrating location.  When I'm actually shredding the tracks it's a blast.  But there is a slim margin for error and then I'm completely messing up.  With those narrow, uneven stretches along the mountain side I just know I need to slow down.  I haven't messed much with tuning much at all.  I'll try your dampeners tip next time."
dirtgame,36wa15,stasisbal,1 point,Fri May 22 18:14:17 2015 UTC,I'll be 3 seconds ahead and then lose 9 seconds like it's nothing on some of the Greece stages.  Some of what I take as slower(2nd and 3rd gear) more technical sections to avoid the rocks and berms the AI seems to take at flat out max speed.
dirtgame,36wa15,gettingout2014,3,Fri May 22 23:49:42 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of trouble with Wales for some reason. I think because I feel it's the easiest routes since they are relatively less twisty than Greece or Monte Carlo, but there's so much less grip that I easily veer off course and hit a tree."
dirtgame,36wa15,AllezCannes,2,Fri May 22 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"For me Wales is difficult because the traction is so good until it isn't and then it is slicker than dog snot.  It doesn't help that my computer starts dropping FPS when I get in the heavy forest... and if it raining, really bad.

dirtgame,36x7mg,HypNoEnigma,1 point,Sat May 23 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm torn between both of them constantly. The Audi Quattro is much more controllable and feels like it sticks to the ground better. For Group B it'd be my starter-recommendation. The 205 is ridiculously fast. It accelerates like crazy and is quite hard to control due to the power it has. Both of them are fast but the 205 is especially quick.  Basically: For speed, it's the 205. For control, it's the Audi. If you're jumping to 4WDs for the first time, get some miles with the Audi and then move up to the next class 4WDs or buy the 205."

dirtgame,36wxgj,RuneRuler,1 point,Fri May 22 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"Here are some interesting articles on suspension set-up. The suspension will affect the ""grip"" and stability of the car, depending on your driving style you might want different amounts of each.   Camber adjustments   Toe in/out adjustments  Regarding a higher speed, you want to adjust how tall your gears are, this will allow for more top end speed but slower acceleration. I rarely ever seem to be able to push over 100 MPH on the faster stages, but maybe I'm just slow.  Adjusting the rear differential could yield some interesting effects. However I'm not really sure of the optimum set up for various surfaces, I generally have them quite loose."
dirtgame,36wxgj,Sfletch132,0,Fri May 22 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"Here are ...   Thank you, interesting indeed! Regarding speed, you are right of course, my top speed is also around 100 MPH, acceleration and grip  is more important to maintain an higher average speed (without going off, as I frequently do)"
dirtgame,36vhux,Murfenator,1 point,Fri May 22 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"Correct. I've asked for them to be available in custom event many times. I've still only got to try a few cars with upgrades, it's too much of a grind to get them and there is only 3 locations which means racing the same roads 1000 times just to try upgrades."
dirtgame,36vhux,marts30,1 point,Fri May 22 13:49:23 2015 UTC,"Ya, if this the case i think its a mistake to not have the upgrades available in custom events and daily online events.

If you have upgraded your car in career mode, you have the same upgrades in daily events too etc. Everyone else has to drive with basic versions without upgrades.   I can't see this any other way than as a major bug.  And for the love of god, who wants to grind all upgrades to all cars with these 3 locations and same stages? Not me anyway..."
dirtgame,36vhux,marts30,1 point,Fri May 22 19:12:08 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. All upgrades are the same for everyone online, go read the Online blog post a few weeks ago."

dirtgame,36sh83,NaughtyEwokCave,5,Thu May 21 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"The thing with AWD cars is that they can be set up to behave a lot like a FWD or a RWD or split the difference.  If you play with the center diff and push power to the front it will act more like a FWD and if you shift it to the rear, RWD.  I personally like mine to be a bit more FWD than RWD.  If you do it that way you can drive it like a FWD car only with this magic power to powerslide rather than just inertially slide and you can get on the gas earlier in the corner without becoming a understeering pig."
dirtgame,36sh83,deadstump,2,Thu May 21 21:19:29 2015 UTC,I'll have to try that. Cheers!
dirtgame,36sh83,Crushker,3,Fri May 22 00:01:30 2015 UTC,I noticed the 6r4 seemed to slide more than the other cars. So I'd set the diffs to pull more from the front. The best group b car for me personally was the Quattro.  I won the masters with two rally wins and a 2nd place. By far the easiest for me to drive.
dirtgame,36sh83,HerpDerpenberg,2,Fri May 22 03:53:20 2015 UTC,"Group B needs throttle control, lots of throttle control.  But use lift off oversteer to help rotate the car and help initiate your drifts and set up for corners."
dirtgame,36sh83,Froppy0,2,Thu May 21 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"I completely second this.  It's more about letting off the gas than heavy braking.  Sometimes you're just gently pushing the gas in bursts and staying the same gear through several corners.  Then, it's flat out as you get into straight aways.  I mistakenly bought a group B car as my 2nd car and had a lot to learn... but I've learned it and it's been great."

dirtgame,36sh83,Murfenator,1 point,Fri May 22 12:20:50 2015 UTC,"Don't start with the Group B cars, their power is ridicoulus! You should start with Group A and then move to 2010's then try Group B. Group B cars you can't be on the gas long at all or youre just going to fast!"
dirtgame,36sh83,TDawg_603,1 point,Thu May 21 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"Part of your issue is that you're driving a mid-engine Group B car: - Mid engine cars (if you drove the Stratos in the 70's class) tend to be prone to oversteer more so than front engine cars. - Group B have lots of power and not a lot of weight making them harder to drive.  On to set-up, I drive the RS200 for Group B and find a 40:60 ratio on the center diff, with moderate tightness (about 3/4 of the way up the slider, give or take a bit) with a nearly locked rear and very loose front tends to work out well enough, also be sure to keep your brake bias more towards the front. This will make the car handle a bit more like a RWD car but still make use of the 4WD benefits."

dirtgame,36oye5,DontCut,11,Wed May 20 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"Really the only way this (or any other game) is going to stand the test of time is to have mod support.  But even then, if the base game is not solid enough it isn't going to make it.  My feeling is that Codemasters really should buckle down and get the game driving and feeling right and then open it up to modding.  I would love for CM to release professionally done country/car/content packs as paid DLC (free would obviously be better) after they finish what they are already laying out as their base game... provided the base game passes muster.  But even then there is no way that they can really keep up with our appetites for new content, and modding is the way to do that.  Let us (the community) unleash our creativity and make this product awesome!  Also if CM stick with this idea and make a next gen version at some point in the future... It would be awfully awesome if they made backward compatibility for the stages at least somewhat easy."
dirtgame,36oye5,deadstump,7,Thu May 21 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"You brought up a good point about future proofing and backwards compatibility.  Every game has it's own unique level, map, gun, feature, etc, (I loved the Croatia track in Dirt 2) and it's a bummer to have those things left behind as a cherished memory.   It's like a constant inefficient recycling process. It would be a good idea, as you say, to make a base game and let the devs and community build off of that.   Left 4 dead 2 is one game I can think of that does this. Near limitless replay value. Custom maps, guns, characters, mods galore. It will be interesting to see if valve will allow compatibility of all the left 4 dead 2 mods in left 4 dead 3."
dirtgame,36oye5,snoozieboi,1 point,Thu May 21 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"yes yes and yes. CM should basically perfect the foundation for the community to build on. CM can still release DLC at top quality and purists etc can develop stuff like RSRBR.    This game will live for 10 years if, and only if, the modding community can keep it alive. If CM want's to launch an annual or bi-annual version of the game they are going to go down the same road as the previous Dirt installments.    I hope CM will be able to think differently on how to control the platform they are making, I assume modding from their perspective is a lost opportunity at income if some super talented modders start making mod cars or tracks that are high quality."

dirtgame,36me62,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Wed May 20 18:33:36 2015 UTC,"Or allow leagues to allow multiple classes per event and score that way.  That way you can have overall victories, and class victories."
dirtgame,36me62,salmonelladub,1 point,Thu May 21 15:35:07 2015 UTC,That wouldn't solve the problem though
dirtgame,36me62,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Thu May 21 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Well, in rally events you typically have a National/International and regional split for competitors. They could adopt a points system like NASCAR that gives points deeper down the placings.  But in a WRC event, they might have 100 entries and still only give points to the top 10. It's that way in a lot of racing events.  If you subset by class, you could have people compete for overall points and class points.    But seasons should still score non-points scoring positions on a total time of the season. For ease of example. Say you have 6 events. One guy runs 10 minutes each event (60 minutes total) and another guy enters 6 for 8,9,10,11,12,13 minutes. Their total is 63 minutes and they place lower in the championship.  But really, what is this for? You don't win credits in leagues, you should really be looking at individual events if you're not competitive for points scoring positions or try to find a smaller league to participate in."
dirtgame,36me62,dsiOneBAN2,1 point,Thu May 21 18:51:29 2015 UTC,It'd be interesting if the single player career system could be adapted. Each season the top X% goes up and the bottom X% goes down. Some percentage of active players per tier.
dirtgame,36me62,deadstump,14,Thu May 21 09:50:40 2015 UTC,"My one wish is that the weight transfer of the cars should be improved.  It doesn't feel like the driver's inputs really do much to the cars weight moving around.  For instance brake dive, throttle squat, and body roll.  It kind of feels like there isn't the 3D aspect where there isn't that inverted pendulum above the axle height that is the car's center of gravity torquing the suspension all around.  This makes left foot braking and flicking the car feel strange IMO.  Edit: More thinking on this.  The body does seem to move around, but it doesn't feel like the weight moves from wheel to wheel much."

dirtgame,36me62,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Thu May 21 09:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think the tire dynamics are a bit too strict for flats and blowouts. We have a saying in rally ""less than 3 (miles), let it be"" for flats. In game, I find I get a flat and then a blowout (which shouldn't happen because audibly the tire deflates) a few turns later.  Also, the cars seem to carry unlimited spares as I can change 2 flats between stages. We should have a tuning option to select 1 or 2 spares. Could have zero as well if you're on the last stage and need every tenth to count."
dirtgame,36me62,deadstump,0,Thu May 21 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"The blow out is typically really the tire tearing itself apart after being dragged all over the place while flat and not being designed for that.  I think that we should have the option of choosing how many spares we want to carry between services (0-2) with the default being 1 and weight savings/penalty depending on your choice.  It would be really neat if there were different treads (wet, dry, intermediate... etc.) and you could carry two tires of different treads than what you have on your car so you could try and optimize your car's tire choices when running on stages that are quite different from each other (either like Monte where one stage is dry and the other is ice, or there is a weather pattern moving in)."
dirtgame,36me62,Phr00t,2,Thu May 21 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"The blow out is typically really the tire tearing itself apart after being dragged all over the place while flat and not being designed for that.   From my rally experience, you're still pretty good driving on a flat, but you need to take more care what you hit. I've drove the ""less than three"" a lot. I've seen competitors drive more than 3 because they ran out of spares.   It would be really neat if there were different treads (wet, dry, intermediate... etc.) and you could carry two tires of different treads than what you have on your car so you could try and optimize your car's tire choices when running on stages that are quite different from each other (either like Monte where one stage is dry and the other is ice, or there is a weather pattern moving in).   It's never realistic to carry a full set of 2 different to replace. You're still half as bad so you get unstable handling. If they want to get technical, most rally tires are dierctional. If you're carrying one right and get a left flat it should represent that in game.  As far as different treads, you typically have soft/medium/hard compounds which have ideal operating temperatires. Based on wet/dry/intermediate you cut the tire tread out. There are some variations to tread but cuts and compound play more at an event than changing tread patterns.  www.ascania-racing.com/Pirelli/Pirelli_rally.pdf  Here's a Pirelli tire catalogue and at the end has info on tire cuts."
dirtgame,36me62,_LV426,0,Thu May 21 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"You are alright driving on a flat as long as you don't drive like it isn't flat and really push it to the point where it will roll over and eat the sidewall or get pinched on the rim and cut.  Once you have a rip it starts to flip its shit and flail around before dropping you to your rim.  Or at least that is my perception.  I got the idea for the mixed sets from watching the WRC where the competitors did what I suggested putting the different tires on the diagonal as a compromise between full dry and studs.  This was for the Monte rally where the conditions varied a lot from stage to stage.  I am kind of surprised that they don't make a rally ""spare"" tire that is bidirectional so that it can be there just incase.  Also I am familiar with the different compound bit (I think cutting would be a little too in depth for a game and the implication would be challenging I think), but if you were in Wales and it was sunny for one segment (between services) and going to rain the next (or maybe a weather change between services) it would be nice to be able to either roll the dice and choose a wierd tire that is optimized one way or the other, or hedge and go for a more all around tire (full soft, full hard, or intermediates)."
dirtgame,36me62,HerpDerpenberg,2,Thu May 21 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Another issue running on flat tires is they start tearing apart and possibly taking out brake lines.  I'd just like them to have a more gradual deterioration instead of being ""flat"" straight to ""blow out"" in a few turns."
dirtgame,36me62,Murfenator,1 point,Thu May 21 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yea, I completely agree.  It also should be driving dependent.  Drive like an ass hat?  BOOM!  Drive easy (especially in corners that would load the flat)?  Will last a long time."

Have the option to drive the stage with no damage and no penalties of any kind (driving backward being the most important).  This would be the recce mode. Have a bank of calls broken out by type (corner, caution, line, description, etc.) be able to pause the game and select a note or combination of notes. Have a ""light wall"" that will start at your current position that you can push forward or back on the course with an adjustable camera.  You place the wall where you would like the note to reference (not where it is called, but the object to be called) and place the wall and note. This way you could run a little section of road and then ""fly"" back to place the notes as you feel they should have been called. Be able to save these notes to be tied to a specific car/stage or to all cars on that stage.  And be able to share these with the community would be awesome would be a really neat way to crowdsource notes. The notes should be fully editable (it would be awesome to be able to edit them outside of the recce mode, but understandable if it is too difficult). It would be really neat if in the bank of calls you had several versions of calls so you get that read live feel (for instance 3 ""6 Left""s read slightly differently) It would also be awesome if you were to be able to select from several style of notes.  Like descriptive, or 1-10, or ""Left 6"" vs. ""6 Left""... etc.  And maybe a couple of voice actors for some greater immersion into the rally world.  Maybe even allow for user recorded calls.   That is how I would implement it."
dirtgame,36me62,deadstump,2,Wed May 20 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm no programmer, so how to implant it still a mystery. But, you would have a speed limit, around 60km/h. When you come to a point that you want to take a note, you would have options that the co-driver will tell you. Eventough the calls are really good imo, doing the stage really slow and pointing things makes you faster and more confident. An example would be a right 6 long 100, It gives you the main thing sure, but depending on the settings you chose for the co-drive, it may take to long to call the next curve that is a right 5 tightens to 2. It may be an option for fine tuning the co driver reactions. Or...the other idea would be to record voice inputs so someone who is willing to could just call everything like he sees it."

dirtgame,36me62,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Wed May 20 23:21:46 2015 UTC,They should consider making a fancy version of the brilliant RBR approach. Won't need to remove the gear unless you want to.
dirtgame,36me62,ArchReaper,2,Thu May 21 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"Long, long, long stages please. 20 - 45 km stages.  I know there's an architectural issue with the Ego engine, but perhaps someone could write in asset streaming? Perhaps chunk-by-chunk loading, draw-distance + 2 km loaded, everything more than 1km behind the driver unloaded?  Those are just ideas."
dirtgame,36me62,ArchReaper,2,Thu May 21 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"Compared to RBR I'd like the ""wheel to suface"" effects on gravel to be more pronounced during wheelspin, locked wheels and sliding. Ambient gravel noise ( pebbles flying around in the wheel hubs,) is amazing.   I've tried reducing all except the surface effects (don't remember the definition) and it's just not loud enough imo. I've never driven a rally car, but plenty of regular cars on gravel and sliding/rolling on road side pebbles and even with a fully ""padded"" car with seats and all the gravel is LOUD and  important (especially in a sim) to get info on how well your wheels are gripping in any direction.   which also reminds me all cars seem to have abs no matter what surface. I'd love the monaco surface to surprise me if I brake on a patchy suface of tarmac and ice. As it is right now I can brake down with no worries into the hairpins."

I don't think its about ""pretending to race cars"" its just a fun activity in and of itself. A FFB wheel allows for a far deeper tactile and for most a more enjoyable experience than using a game pad or a keyboard.     For most I think its simply a bonus that a bunch of the skills used in a driving game or simulator are directly transferable to the real world as well."

dirtgame,36k9ha,LostReaction,5,Wed May 20 04:43:55 2015 UTC,Did you tweak the settings? Here's a discussion about the best setup for the G27 in Dirt Rally:  Learn or share your Logitech G27 settings here  Hope that helps.
dirtgame,36k9ha,Bluth_Rapehorn,2,Wed May 20 09:33:44 2015 UTC,I put about 3 hours on the wheel tonight and I think I just had to get used to it because I am placing better than I was on my Xbox controller. That's all I really wanted in the end. The settings helped a bit also.
dirtgame,36k9ha,LostReaction,1 point,Wed May 20 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"Some of the feel is realistic, some isn't.  I'd say the small yumps and how the wheel feels over those is 100% like it is in real rally.  The countersteering is not.  The small hits over small bumps could use some work but the constant shake is i'd say medium realistic."

There a so many tiny corrections you have to make almost every second and they all have to be exact or you'll end up amongst the trees. There's only so much I can do with a pad so I just ordered a G27.  Maybe Codemasters should start a cross promotion with Logitech/Thrustmaster/etc. because that game is the best reason to buy a wheel (cue howls of derision from the sim crowd). I've played Gran Turismo for years without need for a wheel. Now after shelling out for that I also scooped up Assetto Corsa in this week's Steam sale, after reading about its supposedly superb physics.

The major things I am noticing is no fog/environmental effects on low, no road reflections/lower texture maybe, and very simple shadows and lighting.  Some could argue that some of those features make the ultra low settings easier to drive fast in.  Little things like reflections in the windshield are nice, but not major.  The difference are least noticeable on the dirt stages."

dirtgame,36i21f,Heggy,7,Tue May 19 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"Doubling up on a couple of points.  I would like it if the codriver would reread the next corner's notes after an off, spin, or a major slow down.  I totally agree with the inconsistent roadside hazards.  Some little rocks send me cartwheeling through the air and some big ones don't even register (I fortunately haven't had any run ins with fences that I can think of).  The track distances is key for assessing how hard you are going to push in a stage since on a long stage you have a lot farther to go if you bend the car early than you do on a short stage (obviously).  I would really like a count up/ count down odometer for each stage where at the start of the stage it shows how long the stage is and counts down to the end while simultaneously another is counting up.  Most rally computers have this feature, so it wouldn't be unrealistic."
dirtgame,36i21f,deadstump,2,Tue May 19 15:57:06 2015 UTC,The codriver calling out after you check every checkpoint thing of the stage would be nice. I play with all HUD elements off and some longer stages have me wondering where the finish is.
dirtgame,36i21f,iktnl,3,Tue May 19 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"This is why I use the HUD, that information is available to me in real rally cars (odometer and whatnot). Just because I don't have a monitor big enough to see all my gauges and rally computers doesn't mean that I shouldn't have access to that information."
dirtgame,36i21f,deadstump,8,Tue May 19 21:26:24 2015 UTC,The codriver does not respond to events at all.   I just hit a pole (tied to the core of the earth) at 150Kmh. Co-Driver didn't even flinch and told me the next three corners.
dirtgame,36i21f,JacksGT,3,Tue May 19 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"They should make the codriver react to stuff that happens during the race. They did this in DiRT 3, for example the co-driver would say something like ""great that I didnt have lunch yet"" during a crash. Or he would do grunting noises.  Miss that stuff and makes for a more compelling ride."
dirtgame,36i21f,Agentofsociety,2,Wed May 20 00:04:57 2015 UTC,"When CM did this in DiRT 3, I'm sure they'll do it in DiRT Rally, too. :-)"

dirtgame,36inz5,kasajack,3,Tue May 19 17:51:52 2015 UTC,"If you're not using left foot braking, and sliding in DR, I assure you you aren't trying to go fast enough. Coming from mostly circuit racers, I initially approached this game worried about my lines, clipping the death-berms, and what not. After trying to become faster I realized you have to throw the car around a bit and when you hear ""left 4"" after a long straight, you turn in harder, faster, and earlier and slip around it instead of trying to attack the line."
dirtgame,36inz5,xLarkins,3,Tue May 19 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"LFB is far more useful in RBR than DR. The sliding physics in RBR seem to have a more progressive amount of grip than DR where the grip almost feels binary. In DR it almost feels like the cars tuck them selves back straight in an unusual feeling way.  For example, with LFB in a FWD car it feels like it is acting more like an e brake (reinforced by working better with more rear bias) than through weight transfer.  This doesn't feel right to me.   Also flicking into turns doesn't feel quite right either now that I am thinking about it.  I think that there is still some work on Dr's end with the car dynamics.  I  don't know how to fix it, but it is getting there."
dirtgame,36inz5,deadstump,3,Wed May 20 11:33:20 2015 UTC,"I would have taken him more seriously if he had actually put some minutes into playing Dirt Rally before comparing the two. It's too hard to slide the car!? Not sure if where even playing the same game.   And just because its super easy to slide the car in RBR without hardly losing any speed, could maybe make it more fun to play for some, but that doesn't make it more realistic. Like Call Of Duty for example, is more fun than Arma, even though Arma is more realistic.  Try watching some real rally, and then compare the handling of the two games."

dirtgame,36inz5,GoldReddition,3,Wed May 20 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with what is said in this vid. I don't know which game is more realistic but watching vids with my favourite rallydrivers they seem to have less grip and more slide. Dirt Rally can feel a bit too arcady in that sense and i'm not sure if its mostly settings on the cars or what.  I drive without any aids and feel like the power of the engine and the physics of sliding is just a bit ""off"", I hope this will be improved as i really love the game anyway. Might be a lot to do with the FFB as it seems like it hinders my intuition a lot.. like i can't drive on ""raw feeling"" the same way I can in RBR.  Left Foot Braking does not really happen for me at all in Dirt Rally and in RBR i would not survive a stage without that technique.  Would really love to hear the Devs speak up about this just to get their angle on the whole thing. The physics have had alot of attention with not just driving but also the crashes. Are they working on this atm or are we not understanding what they thought?"
dirtgame,36inz5,najtrows,1 point,Tue May 19 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"I must be missing something, because I keep hearing people saying 'The cars aren't slidey enough', and 'I can't get them sideways'.  Turn off your TCS assists? Stop driving 4WD cars? Most of the group A and B cars are hard to get sideways (though certainly not impossible), but that's what happens when you have four powered wheels telling the car to 'go that direction'. Most of the RWD cars- especially the older, heavier ones seem to have no problem getting sideways and throwing you off a cliff if you're not careful, so I really don't get it.  RBR may be slippier but that doesn't necessarily mean it's more realistic in all instances. Getting a vehicle sideways on loose gravel in the real world, 4WD or otherwise, is NOT as easy as it looks."

dirtgame,36inz5,RiftRacer,1 point,Tue May 19 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"Playing around with the diffs on the 4x4's also give you noticeable change in the handling of the car and I'm able to slide 4x4 cars no problem.  I feel like the handling needs to sit somewhere half-way between RBR's (over difficult) and Dirt Rally (a little to simple) to really hit that sweet spot.  As much as I love RBR though, I'm finding DIRT Rally more enjoyable."

dirtgame,36inz5,najtrows,1 point,Tue May 19 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"You can change the grip levels of every car in Dirt game files. The older cars are put in ""Low""grip category and WRC cars have ""high"" grip. The game feels very much better when you turn every cars grip to low, you can start drifting and sliding trough corners like you thought you could with 500 hp monsters. I think the gamedevs are cutting corners by tweaking the grip like this. Here is something i quoted from racedepartment  i changed the subaru to 'low' grip tires and the difference was subtle at 1st, but it make a huge difference once you get down to the nitty gritty  go to dirt files and cars>models>(select you car of choice, mine was impreza, so '555') >tuning. inside here we have 3 default tuning setups for each country. open each 1 and change the tire grip value at the bottom from 'med' to 'low'  try it out, i think its much harder now, much looser feel to things without having to drive too slow  And here is the list what folder means what car http://www.nogripracing.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1857296&postcount=1  Sorry for bad english, im from Finland and rally is close to my heart :)"

Every time I did, I was helped by the fastest cars incurring huge time losses due to mechanical problems. If you can have enough pace for 2nd place, you can easily win one where the leader has a +5 minute stage.  Unfortunately, this means, unless you are a bit more consistent than I, you will be reseting a lot until you have 99% clean stages throughout. It will give you time to master the stages and learn where the danger spots are, which is nice.  My advice? Buy perks which relate to your car for your enginers, if you get enough, you can go from 0 upgrades to max upgrades after the first event. Cars without upgrades are generally uncompetitive with AI times. That will allow you to do better on events 2 and 3. Alternatively, you can use a car from the start that is already upgraded fully. Personally, I like tackling each new series with a new car with the goal of maxing every car out."

Here's mine: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1tZFkUvbdiFxlZICuhcSb4ISjz3rkd-SjrXaK-2hOU/edit?usp=sharing  I get my stage distances by backing up my profile, resetting my progress, driving the stage carefully, then noting my distance driven in my driver statistics. The distances in the game aren't quite the same as you get from Google Maps, so it's useful to know if the spreadsheet distances actually come from the game or are approximations from GMaps. I also wouldn't bet yet all that reverse stages have identical distances to their forward versions. I haven't done many so far, but I can tell you I got these distances:   River Severn Valley: 10.1 km Vallée descendante: 10.4 km, not 10.9 Pra d'Alart, and Col de Turini Départ: 9.8 km each, not 9.7 Sweet Lamb: 10.0 km, not 10.1   The ""Route"" column in my speadsheet makes it clear if the stage is a half and/or reversed, without having to look at the map. The route number comes from dirtgame.com. So Kathodo Leontiou is route 1, Anodou Farmakas is route 1 reversed (1 R), Ampelonas Ormi is the second part of Kathodo Leontiou (1B), etc. Feel free to copy that information if you want.  Another cool thing is that you can have the actual map images appear in the cells. Just use the IMAGE formula, e.g. =IMAGE(""http://i.imgur.com/gxmRU8p.png"",1)"

dirtgame,36dw18,ricodued,1 point,Mon May 18 17:48:01 2015 UTC,You could get a decent measurement by making note of your 'distance driven' stat in Driver Statistics before and after running a stage very carefully to avoid restarts.

dirtgame,36a62p,SgtMustang,4,Mon May 18 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"Problem is if you have a ""save as mp4 or wmv"" file, that means the game is doing the encoding.

I have no source, but I vaguely remember a comment from one of the devs many years ago saying that the track making process was just too complex/""non user-friendly"" to make into an editor and release to the public.   I may have imagined that comment, or it could have been a real comment but false information. After all, being the only source of tracks allows them to release paid DLC with more tracks or encourage people to buy the next game in the series.    But either way, there's never been a custom track for a game running this engine, so I would presume that unfortunately it will stay this way. Then again, Dirt Rally is a bit of a departure from the usual way of doing things so perhaps miracles are possible."

dirtgame,365c5g,LooneyJuice,2,Sat May 16 08:51:46 2015 UTC,Did Codemasters add their own windmills or is it an older video? Just curious if they would touch up some courses to make them look a little nicer.
dirtgame,365c5g,HerpJersey,2,Sat May 16 16:06:52 2015 UTC,It certainly looks like an older video...
dirtgame,365c5g,dsiOneBAN2,1 point,Sat May 16 19:56:39 2015 UTC,I was the level designer on this track and the windmills are not actually in that position. There are some on the other side of the valley (the hills beyond the finish line) but thought they looked better where they are. As you can see them from distance it gives some focus when you are on the moorland section and also when you are approaching the Sweet Lamb complex from the hairpin. In all honesty that part of Wales...well there are loads of wind farms all over so it still feels right imo. Thanks  Oh yeah and this is how the legendary Peter Soldberg does Sweet Lamb :) https://youtu.be/NgD5-9glIBI

dirtgame,366ttv,krivjur,4,Sat May 16 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"Its just mindboggling that its said the daily event is supposed to be even playing field for all, you dont have to buy the car and its fixed setup so you cant gain advantage through getting a good setup for your driving style but then you get the damn upgrades from your car if you have driven it before!?   I knew from that post that they ofcourse work in weekly, monthly and leagues since you have to own the car, full service park stuff etc. Its logical. For the daily event since you can rally without owning the car and its fixed setup logically it would either have full upgrades or zero.. But i guess your saying it is not intended that way which is really bad and/or badly communicated."
dirtgame,366ttv,krivjur,3,Sat May 16 20:44:32 2015 UTC,"One way to think about it is that in daily events you're given a free car so you can participate. If you already own the car you don't need the freebie (or you can't have multiple instances of same car model). I kind automatically assumed that the upgrade design was initially planned to encourage career grinding, so I expected it would be like this. I didn't even know what the real intention is regarding the daily events. But from the blog http://blog.codemasters.com/dirt/05/dirt-rally-online-events-explained/   The Daily Event is a pure test of skill. Everyone races in the same car, with the same upgrades, on the same stage, in the same weather conditions. Everyone gets one attempt.    ""Same upgrades"". I guess it's a bug then.  Edit: link fix"

dirtgame,3680fn,k_sway,1 point,Sun May 17 02:02:52 2015 UTC,Have your Times improved? This is the first racing game I've taken seriously.
dirtgame,3680fn,k_sway,3,Sun May 17 02:21:22 2015 UTC,"My times were worse the first few races but progressively got better as I became more comfortable with it, now I am getting better times than before.   This is also the first racing game I really got into. I played for around 4 hours with a controller and 6 hours with the G27. I use H-pattern without clutch so I can map the handbrake to the clutch pedal which makes drifting much easier."
dirtgame,3680fn,Mark_McQ,1 point,Sun May 17 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"Righteous, I plan to run a H until I get into the sequential cars. Regarding the g27, it's been the staple set for years, should I buy one or is it going to be replaced soon?"

dirtgame,3680fn,SgtMustang,1 point,Mon May 18 09:11:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say g27 is just the right wheel for you as it has all the elements you might want if when you get interested to other racing games. Im not saying DFGT is bad investment, but it might be better to invest a little more and get the full experience since clutch and H shifter are pretty nice features to have."
dirtgame,366zia,StupidDeep,2,Sat May 16 19:40:29 2015 UTC,You shouldn't yet.  http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/5814/our-wheel-settings-direct-from-the-car-handling-team   All Wheels - Recommend using 200 – 540 degree (however 270-400 is the sweet spot)   Hopefully in future builds Codemasters will implement correct 900 degree support where the wheel locks automatically at the correct rotation for each car.
dirtgame,366zia,djfil007,2,Sun May 17 06:43:39 2015 UTC,"DFGT isn't a shit wheel, first of all. Like the Momo, it's basically a G27 with a different exterior and lacking the (crap anyways) H-shifter and clutch pedal.  Secondly, the steering lock issue can be mediated really well with the steering linearity slider. My Momo only has like 240 degrees and I can drive the Stratos pretty easily. I drive with a linearity of -6."

dirtgame,365hi5,ManNotHamburger,1 point,Sat May 16 22:53:07 2015 UTC,Wow that is way too small of a range. I use 540 and that is very nice. At least for me.

dirtgame,365hi5,happyloaf,1 point,Sun May 17 15:17:47 2015 UTC,Same here. Using a fanatec gt2 wheel and need to pause the game after launch to stabilise the linearity or sensitivity or whatever get botched.

Dirt:Rally is different in that they have a path forward planned all the way to December with content patches, the game is relatively bug free (41 issues and early no codriver aside), and in general just lacks content.    Also, the devs are using this EA more vocally to get player input. IMO, Dirt:Rally is what early access should be, but A LOT of developers don't do that and taint it for the rest."

I've tried the game with a controller with no assists and it feels horrible, by means I can't stay on the road (with wheel easy as pie), because the clunky precision makes me so uncomfortable and trying to go on the same limit as with wheel is simply just impossible.  It's like comparing controller vs mouse&keyboard in fps game. You can be very good with controller but in the end mouse is superior. Obviously everyone cannot become better with mouse or in this case with wheel. Like I said in the beginning, the one you're familiar with and comfortable. I'll still give it a chance."

dirtgame,362pb1,Multicheerios,17,Fri May 15 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"UI Special Questions   #1 biggest frustration: I have no idea what buttons to press on my G27! ""Button 24"" doesn't really help (I know this is a Logitech issue, they should have put symbols on their buttons). Keyboard labels should show up once I switch to the keyboard between sessions. Or just implement mouse support ;) I don't use the quick select menu. It's a cool feature though. I should be able to click the ""Quick Select"" menu with my mouse at any time to activate it. It's not very clear what is wrong with your car between stages. It took me a few events to even realize that I could repair and change my setups. I also don't like how tedious it is to go between each ""advanced"" setup option. It should really all be on one page (maybe with two tabs, Normal and Advanced) N/A I think you could include a lot more information in this screen. What are the general characteristics of each stage? Gravel? Dirt? Tarmac? You have to select each one to find out. There is plenty of room for more pictures/data on that screen. N/A I like the vehicle selection screens.  N/A I like the overall style/theme/design. I'm not sure I understand this question. I prefer mouse navigation to button navigation. I also dislike when menus are hidden behind other menus. I would say that there is a lot of empty space which could easily be used up to cut down on the amount of sub-menus. My main problem at the moment is figuring out which button on my G27 to press to make something happen. Mouse navigation/keyboard icons would help a lot A new race or the settings menu.    P.S. The replays look amazing. Please let me quickly seek through them with my mouse so I don't have to sit there with my foot on the pedal waiting for that epic moment at the end of a particular event. I want to be able to click at the specific moment on the timeline."

I'd like to have an option to set replay camera to ""TV-mode"" only. At the moment, I don't use replays that often, since it is not very good. I dont like the counter that starts immediately when you go offroad. It is needed, but maybe it should not be so eager to pop up This one is not UI related, but there are several hairpins in Monaco, where spectators are standing a bit too close and that causes too many extra penalties Vehicle selection is ok, but maybe there could be a bit more background information about cars and most famous drivers behind them etc.   I love the fact that you really seem to care about our feedback. That is something new to Codemasters. I hope our feedback eventually matters and all is not just pr-crap like usually.  I think this game is really awesome, if you just develop it like a rallysim, fix FFB and few other issues and not try to please everyone. Keep up the good work. Thanks."
dirtgame,362pb1,kautium,6,Fri May 15 17:49:04 2015 UTC,stage length selectable upgrades in custom (if unlocked)
dirtgame,362pb1,marts30,4,Fri May 15 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"My suggestions for the UI  Its simple and clean and I like that, however it feels like at some points it lacks information.  When selecting a course in free mode it just shows the name of the course and not the course itself.  Also the car UI in championship mode should display your teams repair knowledge with that car. This would help you chose which one to take on a course you know is more difficult and you need to take a car your team knows just in case you bang it up a bit.  Cars should also be able to be viewed so I can see all sides.  I also like from DiRT 3 how it gave you a little history lesson too.  The team manegment could be improved.  In my opinion crew members should have stat bars not numbers like this (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVrXICuJgao/maxresdefault.jpg) And as you select/scroll over crew members you should see how the stats they have effects your current overall team stats.  And last but not least, you asked how the maps differentiate between courses and so far so good except some times I can't tell which is the starting point and that line should be colored not the same color as the track.  And for future updates such as hill climb you should use height maps like this (http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/austin_track_map_3d.jpg) to see how the map changes as you climb up.  It would be a cool little feature specifically for hill climb and could provide valuable info on the grade of the track in certain areas. Kepp up the good work! (Sorry for format on mobile)"
dirtgame,362pb1,blankdeck31,2,Fri May 15 18:50:34 2015 UTC,I love the look of that map! Really hoping something like that gets implemented.
dirtgame,362pb1,Major_Winkee,2,Mon May 18 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"No clear indication of when the stage has loaded is by biggest frustration (needs a chime and/or a revving motor to alert me).  Also while I am waiting for the stage to load it would be nice to be able to look at the leaderboards and maybe a damage report for the car (I would assume that this information is already compiled since it is all from the previous stage) Quick launch.  I don't really use it. I would like to be able to make my setups default for a given country in that car.  I hate it when I get out on the stage only to find out that I forgot to load my custom setup. I would like to look at my car in the service area (maybe with some mechanics milling about) so I can inspect it in a free camera mode or something. I want more stage information with the most important being stage length, but with additional information being personal stage records (broken up by era please), the number of times run, etc. Team management.  It is a little clunky figuring out how to do the perks.  Also I would like it if we could delve a little deeper and have a development tree with some diverging priorities like reliability vs. weight or serviceability vs. performance.  Also it would be nice to know how much improvement in repair times will improve for some change in a techs skill level rather than just a number. I would like it if in the quick rally we could mix and match stages from different countries.  And that whole menu just doesn't feel super intuitive... especially with a wheel (like the adding stages should be done in the stage selection window and not in the region select). If we are going to have to use just a controler I would like it if there were only two real buttons to use in the menus.  A yes and a back button.  All of the other choices should be highlighted with the directional control and then selected with the yes button. The car selection menu is nice.  I would like to have some more information about the car available (sub menu), both general (light history lesson) and personal (km driven, stage wins, rally wins). The advanced setup is a little clunky.  Maybe just have an option at the front to change everything to advanced rather than going into each component individually. Regarding stage names.  If a stage is just another stage reversed could it just be called that stage reversed. Oh yea, I kind of feel like you shouldn't 'hide' the fact that there are only two roads for each country.  I feel like you should have a map overview of the region and have the stage get highlighted (maybe with a bit of a pan and zoom).  This way you could use those junctions that are already existing to make spurs and/or loops to add to the stage you have so far without having to completely reinvent the wheel.   Quite happy.  Keep up the good work.  Edit: Highlighted what I think might be my best idea"
dirtgame,362pb1,deadstump,2,Fri May 15 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Feeling good about the game knowing that FFB is being worked on and is a priority. Dev interaction is always a plus. It would be nice to know a bit more about how leagues and online play is going to be developed. ATM it seems like the tools and rulesets are pretty limited. It's not clear how to have leagues for various skill levels. Good so far, communication that is open and honest like its been is great for early access games. The amount of effort it takes to work on car setups. I like to run a stage to evaluate a change in the setup, make a change, and then run the stage again. This is not possible with the current UI. I have to create a custom event; load the setup; save the setup; start the race; end the race or quit; then to change i have to go back in and create a new custom event. It's tedious and annoying. I don't use the quick select much since I tend to start the game knowing what I'm going to be doing in it for that session.  I'd like to have a manner of seeing my progress of my times per stage. There's no place to save or view replays. During replays there no way to know which camera you have selected (this is a problem when you want to go back to the random camera). There's no way to save prefered rally race selections (i.e., I have a series of stages and conditions that I like). You cannot select stages between multiple locations.  It would be helpful to display the maps of the stages during stage selection.  At the end of the event it would be nice to also know how you did against your personal best and also historic average with the various leagues you are in. My biggest problem with vehicle selection is I don't know how to turn off the upgrades to go back to a stock setup. It's also not clear which vehicles offer what benefits over the others. Maybe some historic information about them would be nice as well. Team management doesn't seem like it plays much of a role beyond unlocking the engineers for better repairs during rallies. I don't care about the 'engineers' beyond their numbers. They don't improve as I improve. I don't have to change them if I change cars, etc. Mouse support would be awesome.  The concern about getting into a race quickly is an interesting motivation for the UI design. You can get into a race quickly enough. From an intermediate user's perspective it's odd how the online and offline aspects of the game are separated. Some of the online is in Career and some is in Leagues. Offline is in Career and in Custom Events. There's not a clear delineation between the two. This may become an issue when rallycross is introduced and some form of lobby is required. If in a rally I go to the vehicle repair and then the car setup."
dirtgame,362pb1,djqberticus,2,Fri May 15 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"My number one frustration is that if I'm using my wheel (MS Sidewinder FF), certain game functions become unavailable, as in there's no button assigned to them and there seems to be no way of accessing that function.  That includes changing stage conditions, changing livery of the car, certain league standings viewing options, but sadly also important options in the team management menu, like extending the contract for a team member or selecting perk slot:  https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wzrYGN-BMrE/VVakDQ3MurI/AAAAAAAA8Qw/DJJ9OsdI8g8/w1596-h998-no/drt_2015_05_16_03_53_17_851.png  https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JwZw2JKjfr4/VVakDXmXcaI/AAAAAAAA8Qs/b9p_pM-tS2M/w1596-h998-no/drt_2015_05_16_03_53_36_094.png  I know that wheel is pretty old and doesn't have a lot of buttons (eight including paddle shifters, and also there's no dpad), but it should still be possible to access the functions in some way, like via keyboard. But on keyboard, only F1 and F2 seem to work when this happens (so when I'm repairing my car, I can at least view the recommendations, even if I can't accept them all at once and have to manually set each bar). Would be nice if the controls were not ""one or the other"" (as in controller or keyboard), but if keyboard was actually usable even when the player is using a controller.  That (and the fact that it seems like my wheel config gets reset and keyboard is set as default controls) is the most annoying and frustrating thing about DR UI for me.  Apart from that:   An option to view a map of the stage beforehand might be nice Never used Quick Select, it just seems easier to traverse the UI the ""normal"" way. Could be useful with mouse control, though, I guess. The Team management menu is kinda confusing to me. I can manage (when I can access it ;) ), but it's not very intuitive and kinda convoluted, IMO. Took me a while to comprehend how it works the first time I saw it. Advanced setup is kinda annoying to go through with all the back and forth between standard and advanced setup, and it's also pretty well hidden if you're not aware of how to access it - there's no visual cue to inform you that you can go deeper into the setup apart from that small text at the bottom of the screen. There should be a more visible notification that the stage finished loading. That ""Continue"" prompt is very easy to miss now. Now I know what to look for, but before that, I often kept waiting for the game to load when in fact it has already finished loading and was waiting for my input."
dirtgame,362pb1,Case_f,1 point,Sat May 16 02:21:42 2015 UTC,"I'm still playing the game daily and still no signs of slowing down. I like the amount of communication from your part, it's enough for us to know what you are doing without going to the point where you have to argue about your approach every time anything happens/doesn't happen. Remember, community in small doses is a good thing, too much, and everyone hates eachother.  Then to UI specific:  UI is clean and easy to understand but sometimes i wish there would be bit more information about stages and what is coming next. Many times when i've been racing for hours, i just want a short race but when i continue the race to next stage, it's a long stage and i have to wait it to load until i can save and quit.  Team should be shown more when you are going to race and how it affects to your car so that people could know that it actually exists.  Leagues should be in the same place as championship and challenges. I don't see a reason why it's not there as the functionality is the same.  My advice, don't add too much information to the UI as it can become hard to understand really quickly but i would like to see more small things like stage lenght, what's coming next, what is my cars healt without going to the repair screen and maybe a quickbutton (press the gas pedal to the medal) to start the race when you have made the changes to the car or just repaired it. The small things that make you smile when you use/see them."
dirtgame,362pb1,Zeali,1 point,Fri May 15 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"This goes for the UI in both the in-game and on the leagues menu, we could do with more information on the stage information screen. Mainly when creating custom events or going through championships.  It would be great if we had info on how long the stage was in km/mi, and what sort of times we're supposed to aiming for. Showing something such as your personal best would be nice.  As for the league side of things, just the distance in brackets would be nice when selecting the stages for each event. Something like: ""Sweet Lamb (x.xxkm/mi).""  Someone did do a mock-up somewhere on this sub-reddit but I can't seem to find it at the minute."
dirtgame,362pb1,forceh,1 point,Fri May 15 18:37:46 2015 UTC,I've got no issue with the UI. I never use quick select though.
dirtgame,362pb1,Major_Winkee,1 point,Fri May 15 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"New guy here, done with the first championship, the first thing that I noticed is that I need more DATA! Stage times with a particular car, maybe a ghost feature, comparing times with friends (or a full leaderboard percentage, for example top 30% etc.).   I don't even know what quick select does, will try it next time.  I'd welcome rally stage length during the minimap section in the menu.  Someone mentioned it already, but the ""Loading"" and ""Continue"" things are sometimes really hard to see, maybe make them bigger with a bolder font?  Reward screen is fine, I would welcome a tutorial screen of sorts that explains how much money can you make reaching a position on different difficulties, example: 10k for third place on clubman, 15k on elite (no idea about the real numbers, just an example), so I can plan ahead my next car purchase.  Vehicle selection with liveries is too tiny for me, it would be nice to have an option to see the car in 3D (or 2D but from an angle instead of side) while changing liveries."
dirtgame,362pb1,Razon,1 point,Fri May 15 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to realize when it's done loading a stage. Its not obvious enough that something happened. Sometimes I find myself waiting for too long and I could've already pressed continue :P  Never used quick select but maybe I should? I use a g25 and also my wireless Logitech K400 keyboard to navigate. I prefer buttons before mouse.     The new stuff I added    I actually miss the UI from dirt 2. I liked the feeling of being at an event. I didnt like the Americanization of it but if you did something like that but with the service tent kind of thing then I would love this game(and you) even more. This is an example Seeing some 3d models and hearing some people muttering about some stuff and the ""changing tires"" sound helps immersion. And we are all big kids that want to ""play rally"" arent we? :D        Also, I would love to have the country select and the stages in the same screen. And to be able to select stages from different countries when making my own rally. Later on when there are more stages I would love to sort them in different ways. For example all the mostly gravel stages, and all the mostly tarmac ones, with all the different countries just in there in the mix. Kind of how ""detailed list"" option in Microsoft Windows looks. With different slots of info to sort after. examples: Surface type, Length (starting with shortest to longest and being able to change to sort from longest to shortest) and maybe Popularity online or something like that.        Team management feels very ""excel sheet""ish. I like to see stuff, even if it isn't a big thing. But 3d models of things help a lot to get away with the sterile thing. Not a big thing though but I'm just giving you the feedback I have :)  Would be grand to involve liveries into the career thing. To make my own one, to make the car MINE. I would like to see the cars as 3d models instead of just a boring pic. And I would love to be able to name the co-driver after my brother which I have driven many km in the Swedish woods with.        Not really UI: I really hope you will let us have some sort of ""free mode"" where we can drive a rally-cross car on a hill-climb stage and a hill-climb car at the Monte Carlo rally. Stuff to let us have more fun and do dream tests we would like to do if we had all the money in the world. I see a Sim as kind of a sandbox to play around as well as a place to replicate real life contests.       Still not UI: Maybe this is too hard to make, but i'm throwing this out here. If we could have options to have snow stages without snow and maybe even non snow stages with snow, then I would have lots and lots and lots of fun! I like options, It's fun to experiment and fiddle around with stuff.       Still waiting for some kind of practice/set up area to play around and feel some settings in. This would help greatly to understand what the different setups actually do. I'm a bit scared going in to the advanced setups because it feels like I'm always gambling and hoping that I wont screw myself out of the rally with my new setup.      AND, when you make rally Sweden. Please have some people grilling hot dogs in the forest :D It's such a big part of the rally ;) :D  p.s. I would love to hear more from you if you want. I check in on this subreddit every morning with my coffee to see if there is something going on. You have yet to annoy me with posting stuff to often.     edit: added some stuff."
dirtgame,362pb1,najtrows,1 point,Fri May 15 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"At the end of the race, if I watch my replay the button sequence gets me confused every time.  I press back to exit the replay, then I press back again and it asks me if I want to restart the stage.  I would correct this by when you press back, bring up a confirmation dialog asking if you want to leave at which point you would press your confirm button and you would be good to go to continue the rest of the prompts to get to the next race / back to the menus. I always forget about the quick select navigation. Loading indicator / continue button prompt should be more visible when stages are being loaded. When selecting a track (custom events) I would like to see a stage length indicator whether the information be given in kms or number of segments.  Just so I can find the longer stages easier. Rewards presentations are fine. Vehicle selection - It would be neat if more information were able to be provided on the vehicles, whether it be stats or a bit of history on the vehicle.  I have no problems with the selection. Team Management - Perk management is very weird on the steering wheel.  Having one button for each task is a bit strange.  Would it be possible to have a directional movement option for selection?  Even if it means using the keyboard for those tasks.  Even better, allow mouse control to select things.  The one button for upgrading perks, then another button to move to a different perk etc.  Also when a new perk is available, it would make a lot of sense to have the empty perk preselected.  I've selected a new perk for an already selected perk, a number of times and then left with my empty perk still empty. I'd almost prefer if I could press A or my advance button to highlight a specific engineer then have a popup menu show up where I can select (search for new engineer / change perks / extend contract etc) The outside UI (General Navigation) is pretty clear.  Being able to navigate around using the directional buttons and using Select to open the options makes good sense. I prefer actual screen navigation (General menus good.  Team management iffy) The speed of the general menus is great to get into a race.  No complaints there.  Stage length info during stage selection in Custom Event is needed.   What follows is stuff that would be nice to have / see.   The after a race situation is a tough one.  WRC 4 had a neat system in which after a race you would be shown a maintenance area where you could access your repairs and car setup.  I really liked this situation as you could see your car and work on it, if you needed to exit you could back out from that point, but it always felt like there was continuity between the stages.  Dumping out to a menu makes the game have less of a continuity between stages and that little feature made the feel of a rally event that much more immersive.   When you backed out you ended up in an office (Which would be better for team management stuff). If you plan on expanding multiplayer at any time where players can be in a lobby, having a service area where your driver could move around his car and or walk over to other player's service areas would be huge bonus."
dirtgame,362pb1,dsiOneBAN2,1 point,Sat May 16 01:58:59 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about the game this week?   Still as addicting as it was before, yesterday I won a stage that I thought I was just safely bringing it to the next service area on, totally changed my approach from then on.   How do you feel about us? Are we talking enough? Too much?    Seems about right.   Are we talking about the right things?   FFB is super important of course, but not hearing anything about improving the damage model (at least a slider for how realistic) is a bit worrying.   What could we do better?   Improved damage model and vehicle body friction on surfaces.  UI Special Questions   What is your Number 1 biggest frustration in the UI?   The loading screen's ""Hit A to Continue"" text doesn't pop out enough to be easily noticed.   Do you use the Quick Select to navigate the UI?   Yes, it's very useful. I don't always use it but don't get rid of it!   Is there any extra information that you would like to have available to you in the Service Area or is it ok?   It'd be nice to know how many stages until the next service area, for taking penalty time to actually fix something instead of just taping it together. It'd also be nice to know how body damage affects the deterioration of everything else, do I need to go and lose a body panel to affect the parts underneath it, or does just having a lower % of body damage mean everything wears slightly faster?    Is there anything missing or misplaced in the UI?   Besides the hard to notice continue from loading screen button, I can't think of anything.   Does the UI identify Rally Stages clearly enough?   I'm not sure what you're really asking here, but it'd be nice to know the topography of the area, or at least introduce height to the track map.   How do you feel about the way rewards are presented and the end of an event?   A little pop up at the end is kind of plain, it'd be cool to actually see your car's final state on a podium/in the garage alongside the bill of damages!   What works or does not work on the UI for Vehicle Selection?   Vehicle selection seems fine.    Do you find the Team Management part of the UI easy to understand and navigate?   Yes, the comparison features are useful too.   What is your favourite thing about the UI?   The ""you're too poor to afford this"" bleep alongside your CR flashing red is just really good. Quick select is great too, I wish every game had it so I'd actually remember to use it all the time :p   Do you prefer screen hot buttons or actual screen navigation?   I always try to learn and use shortcuts so the hot buttons work well for me (note: I use a 360 pad right now so I don't have the confusing numbered buttons wheel users have). Being able to use a mouse to navigate everything would be nice too though (I suspect it'll be more than nice once my G27 arrives)   Does the UI allow you to get into the race quick enough   Yes, most of my time spent when I'm trying to race is spent loading/on the loading screen not yet noticing the continue button.   Where do you most often go when you return to the UI from a race   Team management and/or checking the status of vehicle upgrades/how close I am to my next target in terms of CR."

dirtgame,362pb1,greatestname,1 point,Sat May 16 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I have not played much at all, only a few free races, as I wait for the force feedback update. So my take on only a few of the topics:   I often miss that ""done loading stage"" indication, as others have said. I would like to see better UI buttons for wheels instead of generic ""button 1"", e.g. my Logitech DFGT has most of its buttons labeled. Stage selection in custom race mode could use a track outline and length indication. The name does not tell me anything when I am looking for a track with hairpins. I like the clean and straight forward look of the UI. Very easy to use. Service area: Can the effect of damage be quantified and displayed? I am not sure how doing 3 points more repair in area X will change the car's performance. The quick nav looks like an interesting idea, but I would have to play quite a bit more to say if it is helpful or not.    Do you prefer screen hot buttons or actual screen navigation?   I do not know what this means."

dirtgame,363wn3,Razon,3,Sun May 17 20:14:14 2015 UTC,yes this is vital. also will add so much to the game. the whole point is to race and be the fastest ;D so comparing your times with others i see as vital.  with project cars you could go to the website select the track and you typed in your own player name and it would show all of your times & comparisions. that would be amazing if it could be added to DiRT RALLY.

dirtgame,360zvi,PurpleEnzo,7,Fri May 15 04:33:49 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue with handling is it feels too hard to get sideways. I harped on the fact that as a former driver I know what feeling comes through the wheel of a awd drive car and this feels off. The wheel follows the path the car is traveling. So if the car is sliding right around a left hand turn, the steering wheel will turn to the right with little effort. On Dirt you have to manually turn the wheel to control a slide.   On the topic of sliding, you really don't have to go that fast to get the car sideways. My relatively low powered wrx had enough power/speed to drift only going around 40 to 50 kph in some rather open corners.   Here's an example of me as a rookie on a small rallyx track, notice how slowly im going but the car easily slides https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MBvQGV2OXD0"

dirtgame,360zvi,Olemartin111,2,Fri May 15 08:04:12 2015 UTC,"4wd cars have huge differences in their torque bias'. The subaru understeers like mad and you have to manhandle it into corners because of the 90:10 torque bias, switching to more enjoyable 40:60 or 30:70 is much better for me. Group B Peugeot is 10:90 which is quite crazy.   Apart from that I think there is definitely something wrong with lateral grip and braking, with braking might have something to do with the mud physics (you bury yourself into the gravel when you brake hard into a corner, slowing you down much faster, i dont think on gravel you should slow down quite that much)"
dirtgame,360zvi,gheeDi,1 point,Fri May 15 09:35:45 2015 UTC,"Could you screenshot the setups? I really like excessive oversteer, unless it literally spins on every corner."
dirtgame,360zvi,Crushker,1 point,Fri May 15 08:14:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, you bring up a good point. I like my car on the slidey side, so I usually set the middle and rear diffs to 100 and the front to about 55/60. Makes all the difference."
dirtgame,360zvi,deadstump,3,Fri May 15 08:45:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is a fairly inconsistant amount of grip available.  Usually there is way too much grip and I can brake very late into corners, but in other corners the grip just seems to go away and I just push.  It makes it rather difficult to gauge how hard to drive when the grip is all over the place like that.  Also I haven't noticed any squirm under braking.  If I lock up one wheel the car doesn't kind of crab out on me or anything."
dirtgame,360zvi,adyrhan,1 point,Fri May 15 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"Well, from what you say at the end, I don't think you feel the cars grippy. That's just understeer, which is lack of grip on the front tyres.  And I think it depends on the car. I feel the BMW is a bit more grippy (in the sense you steer and it goes exactly there where you want) but also manageable when trying to go sideways. The Sierra RS500 for instance, is a more unpredictable machine, because I feel it tends to understeer at corner entry and then massive oversteer when accelerating at the exit.  Try adjusting the car for the handling you want. For the Sierra I've tried yesterday to put the brake bias a bit to the rear, so it rotates more at the corner entry, and I also try to brake more softly. Then accelerate progressively at the exit. It works."
dirtgame,360zvi,adyrhan,3,Fri May 15 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"Yes there is understeer, but there is genuinely too much grip in the WRC cars at speed. You should have to slide through some of the wales stages, but it seems that you can just drive through most corners with no issues."

I can get through most stages just fine in RWD with lift-off, weight transfer and scandinavian flicks.  But with the AWD, I have to abuse the handbrake to get around the understeer.   Any pointers for that?"
dirtgame,35vyc9,Trackpad,6,Thu May 14 00:40:14 2015 UTC,"If you have advanced tuning unlocked on any of the AWD cars with a center differential, I'd look at the front to rear torque balance. I've looked at that on some of these cars and they're set to 60:40 or even 90:10(!?) F:R torque.  It also doesn't help that unless you've unlocked the upgrades, you're ~70 horsepower down from what the stats on the selection screen say."
dirtgame,35vyc9,PegasusDeep,2,Thu May 14 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah to be honest I haven't played the AWD's much so I don't know how much I can help; but try setting your brake bias back a bit, that should help tip the car in on entry.. not too sure about on exits; I work with rallies and drive a little bit, but I'm not at all a pro.. probably adjusting cambers would your first go-to.. Although I've also heard a fair few people say that the stock setups should be fine, in general..  ""The idea of balancing a car on the way into a corner is to exchange the brake for the steering, just like you exchange the steering for the accelerator on the way out. The timing of this exchange effects the balance of the car through weight transfer. If you relieve brake pressure and turn in afterwards, any car is going to just want to plough straight on."" Some guy on the net, but a pretty good summation"
dirtgame,35vyc9,Phr00t,2,Thu May 14 03:59:38 2015 UTC,"Patience with the throttle. The AWD's that I've driven in Dirt somewhat realistically emulate what AWD is like on loose surfaces IRL: which is more akin to FWD than RWD.  As soon as you get on the throttle, your rotation will stop and you'll get understeer. So, like the old racing adage says: ""Don't get on the gas until you're sure you don't have to get off it again"""
dirtgame,35vyc9,Windscar1001,2,Thu May 14 04:43:12 2015 UTC,Yes! I struggle with the group B Audi.  I absolutely love the Lancia Stratos.. So used to driving it fast now.   For AWD it seems like I've started to get the hang of it.. Hairpins seem much easier to get right since the car doesn't want to spin . It's more - point and go! So just getting it turned right is the challenge.. A little bit of handbrake on the tight turns and it rotates beautifully!

In FWD, it's easy to mash your foot into the floorboards and get the front tires to drag you where you need to go.  With RWD you need to get used to using less gas.  Pretend you've got a yardstick.  If you hold it vertically with your fingers pinching the top, it's not hard to move it around,  That's FWD.  RWD is holding your palm open and balancing the stick vertically on it.  You can move the stick where you need to, but it requires a bit of finesse."

dirtgame,35y7f6,CroSSGunS,3,Fri May 15 18:47:28 2015 UTC,"I loved the Ford Escort, but I haven't driven the Stratos.  RWD cars will want to oversteer, to greater or lesser degrees, whenever you have your foot on the throttle and the car isn't perfectly straight.  So the first thing to do as /u/My_0-3 said, is get used to using less throttle.  The second thing to do is to learn how to rotate the car.  This is done using the steering (obviously), but to assist the steering you can try lifting off the throttle (which will cause a little bit of extra rotation) or gently applying the brakes (which will cause more rotation).  Stay away from the handbrake, because it'll cause the back to come around too quickly.  Once you've got the car rotating through a corner, you use throttle to keep the car sliding (along with relevant amounts of counter steering), but not so much throttle that you spin the car (and the slower the front wheels are travelling, the easier it will be to spin under throttle).  Practice makes perfect with this - it isn't easy especially if you haven't driven RWD before, so start off slow, with little rotations and little bits of throttle, until you start to get a feel for it.  Someone posted this awesome video earlier today - keep an eye on how early he's braking, how he's using the throttle, how he's getting the car rotating, and how much steering is involved in keeping the car straight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqx9cH_r9ig"
dirtgame,35y7f6,kautium,1 point,Thu May 14 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"I won the first greek event with the stratos and it was fairly challenging, that unlocked the advanced setup for that car and i was able to get my hands dirty with a custom setup and i modified pretty much everything, also there is a particular setting that helps in the turning and in diminishing the oversteer during a turn (if you change it too much it is said to possibly cause understeer even). Well, after i made the custom setup within the advanced system i won the uk event with like 40 seconds on the second.  Just keep at it and get used to it, it is driveable, it is just not very easy in the beginning with the simple setup.  I personally think that the simple setup > advanced setup unlocking is silly and they should just give us the advanced setup right away, and also throw away those engine upgrades (without them some cars feel slow as hell, the mini for example, same story, greece challenging, rest was too easy after unlocking the engine upgrade, didn't even need to create a setup for that one).  Anyway believe in yourself, don't expect the game to be easy, get to know the car and stay below your limit, a cleaner drive is often faster than an all drifty one. In greece without the advanced custom setup it was very hard to do hairpins by controlling the oversteer of the stratos with the gas pedal in the beginning, so i just did them without drifting and it worked a charm on the times."

dirtgame,35uo0r,djfil007,1 point,Wed May 13 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Great job! I tried to find them, and while I was looking in the correct area, it seems I was somewhat off.  Also, it's interesting that you have to speed up the real-life footage for them to match. Playing through the game, it kinda feels to me like the cars in the game are faster than it should be (most rally games seem to have this problem, RBR being one of the few exceptions, probably because of people always complaining about the feeling of speed), especially if you want to keep up with the AI. Would be interesting to try and match the same stage with the same car (Escort Mk2) to see how they compare."
dirtgame,35uo0r,pjlee98,3,Wed May 13 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"Great job!  Way to find it.  That's awesome.  Super happy that these are real life stages... but I really hope they have the opportunity to add one or two more for each country/region.  Two ""long"" stages split and reversed to make ""12 stages"" per region isn't my idea of perfect... but it's better then the simple loop we saw in the latest WRC games."
dirtgame,35uo0r,MahNilla,2,Wed May 13 18:22:41 2015 UTC,Great work. I struggled to find them myself but well done for finding them. At least I was looking in the right location.
dirtgame,35w5zd,Djangohohoho,5,Thu May 14 00:37:53 2015 UTC,"All of the tracks in this game are built out of two 'long' tracks per region, and those two 'long' tracks typically start/end at or very near the start/end of the other in the region. Each 'long' track is about 8-10 mins of racing, so a 'region' course, two long tracks tethered together would be about 20ish mins of racing.  While I agree that lengthy tracks would be fun and challenging, anything longer than that, in my opinion, would be too much. That said, it probably wouldn't take a tremendous amount of effort to tie the ends of the two base tracks for every region together to form a supertrack. It's more likely a limitation of having to load a massive swath of road and having everything run smoothly."
dirtgame,35w5zd,itsCrisp,1 point,Thu May 14 13:14:18 2015 UTC,From what I seen we are also driving too fast in the game compared to real rally which makes the tracks faster. Because comparable video of the Greece stage with the real run on that track is 6 mins compared to 18 min real life.

This is how it Early Access should be done: listening to community feedback, constantly improving the product and most importantly, communication."

dirtgame,35w6yx,-Oggy-,2,Thu May 14 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"I have a Sapphire 7870 GHz Edition.  My GPU's clock speed is 1050 MHz and RAM is 1250 MHz out of the box, but I'm running 1080 MHz and 1280 MHz respectively which gives me a noticeably better FPS in game.  I have been using medium shader setting with crowds on ultra low and ground cover on either low or off and I haven't dipped below 60 fps since the latest patch.  I haven't had any more stutters either."
dirtgame,35w6yx,euronate,2,Thu May 14 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'll have to try that out.  I too have a 7870 and I can run steady 45 FPS on Ultra / 60 FPS on High but it will occasionally drop to ~14 FPS for 5-10 seconds.  Seems to happen around the same parts of the stage each time."
dirtgame,35w6yx,stengun,1 point,Thu May 14 21:28:16 2015 UTC,Who made your GPU?  That makes a big difference in the GPU's performance.  Not all 7870's are created equal.
dirtgame,35w6yx,euronate,1 point,Thu May 14 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"That made a huge difference.  I still get a rare drop to ~14FPS in some sections but it occurs much less often and shorter duration.  I left everything else on Ultra and when not dropping I now get 60FPS instead of the 45 I got before.  Crowds can look a little weird sometimes but it's worth it.  I suspected I was losing time due to how unresponsive the controls became during those FPS drops.  With these settings I knocked about 30 sec off my average stage time!   Win 7 SP1 64 FX-8120 16GB DDR3 Radeon 7870 2GB - ASUS, not Ghz edition (860/1200)"
dirtgame,35w6yx,stengun,1 point,Fri May 15 16:50:11 2015 UTC,I highly recommend running HWiNFO64 to monitor your GPU and CPU usage in game.  It'll help you see what changing certain settings does to your GPU usage.  I would try lowering shadows down to medium or high to see if that stops the stuttering.
dirtgame,35w6yx,euronate,1 point,Sat May 16 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Originally I missed the part where you said you had all the other shaders on medium.  I gave that a try and it didn't really make any difference.  I then tried running several benchmarks with Crowd on Ultra Low, Ground Cover on Low, and everything else various mixes of low/med/high.  Got pretty much the same results any way I tried.  60-62FPS with occasional drops to 14-17FPS, always at the same sections.  Even Low preset with crowd turned down to Ultra Low still gave the same drops.  Ultra Low preset was the only setting where no FPS drops occurred.  The best mix of quality/performance I've found so far is High preset, Crowd to OFF, Ground cover to Low."

Team equipment (specialized tools, team vehicles (and packing them), etc.) Tire management with multiple tread types and try to get the optimum setup for the rally and between services (dry, wet, intermediates, aggressiveness of studs for Monte or snow... etc) On car tire management (how many spares to bring between services with the weight penalty, what to bring to best optimize for the upcoming stages, stuff like that) Better control over upgrades and more options that may have conflicting development trees (like reliability/durability vs. weight and/or power) or better serviceability... etc.   3- Better access to league standings 4- Hot seat local multi player  Features   Crazy NBA JAM! style flashes in the town sections of the night Monte stages. Era appropriate crew wear - vintage clothing for the 60's and whatnot A pacenote editor -  Super important!!!  Please! Some more crew crash animations.

A live test and tune circuit track for each country where I can pause and live edit the car settings.

Putting myself in the correct position relative to the screen is super important. Removable steering and hands. Some sort of better suggestion box than the steam page.

(also related to this, is true triple screen support with separate screen rendering)  2) more detailed\realistic car damage... it seems really weak currently, except the tyre blowouts.  3) other cars on stage (proper staggered start)... and that means with proper staggered starts... WRC is 2 minute gaps I believe... while this means you'll rarely see cars (unless they or you make mistakes) this should still be there... also on dirt stages this would mean the earlier cars 'sweep' the stages, and later cars would have an easier time."

dirtgame,35ut4z,SonicBroom51,1 point,Wed May 13 19:05:59 2015 UTC,"So I had my Logitech DF GT for about 3 years and when Dirt Rally came out I knew it was time for a G27...  I've had it for a week so far and I love it! Coming from the DFGT, I was particularly impressed with the pedals, they're metal and well put together. Also the brake pedal's resistance is excellent. IRL the brake is much firmer than the rest of the pedals and with the G27 it's the same way.   The wheel is also quite a bit better, it doesn't feel cheap and the FFB (I use FFB tweaked specifically for the G27 made by a guy on racedepartment) feels better than the DFGT, it doesn't feel as clunky and loud. The one con with the wheel seems to be the sequential shifters, they look and feel like cheap sheet metal. Although I use the H shifter anyways.   Overall once you purchase it, I imagine you'll be absolutely satisfied with it. It's an excellent starter setup if you want to mod it down the line."

That's where you need to listen closely for those distance call outs between the turns and for the length of turns. As for inconsistencies in the braking & gears for a three or w.e that's why I always tell myself it's better to brake too early than it is to brake too late. AND why i think of it as a brake pressure callout versus speed. If I hear 3 I will always get on the brake a tad bit unless I'm already slow from coming out of a 1 or 2 turn. The ability for custom pacenotes would be really REALLY useful though to help everyone fine tune their co-driver's calls.
dirtgame,35tfki,Ashiataka,1 point,Wed May 13 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"I am not a novice when it comes to pacenotes (lots of RBR and RSRBR, and a fairly serious rally nut), but the pace at witch they are delivered is just a little off.  I would like it if they were somehow speed speed related so when I am driving really fast the notes come earlier (distance wise) and when I am driving slow they come much later ad overall the time until the corner would be the same."

dirtgame,35vg4y,jar0ne,3,Thu May 14 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"There are 2 or more teams.  Each team has 1 mouse and 1 or more cats. The mice are racing to the finish. The cats are trying to protect their mice and stop the other mice from winning.  The mice are so slow that there isn't too much of a race between them alone, it's all about trying to avoid the cats while still maintaining the lead."
dirtgame,35vg4y,justbiglee,2,Thu May 14 06:29:49 2015 UTC,i hope we just focus on rallying first! Making proper tracks and fixing the overall feeling of driving are the first things to do.

dirtgame,35vb37,itsCrisp,1 point,Thu May 14 13:17:43 2015 UTC,Would like to know this also.
dirtgame,35vb37,d0caL,1 point,Thu May 14 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"I think it defaults to 50/50, mine is 60/60. Just a little more sensitive than normal."
dirtgame,35u4s9,SmokeyHops,4,Wed May 13 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"I play with X360 controller, too. I use default options, all assists off except automatic shifting. After some learning time I can now drive quite good. It is enough to get into the top tier during online events. I really like it. :)"
dirtgame,35u4s9,Krusi85,1 point,Wed May 13 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"yeah, 100% the same with me. took some time to get used to but now i got to 5th in the reddit league :p. lets see if i stay there till the end"
dirtgame,35u4s9,Sofaboy90,1 point,Wed May 13 17:09:28 2015 UTC,"What exactly are the default settings? I've tinkered quite a bit, is it 50/40?"
dirtgame,35u4s9,d0caL,2,Thu May 14 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"PS2 controller here, with right stick for throttle and brake. I did not touch anything. I saw the XML config files for dinput devices, and they appear to be preset pretty well for controllers (good deadzone etc). Probably quite good for X360 controllers as well.  All assists off, manual sequential shifting. With the simcade physics model you don't struggle too much with steering lock and sensitive throttle/brake, unlike sims like Assetto Corsa and some others. Perfectly possible to end up being super fast with a controller, I'm sure."
dirtgame,35u4s9,XJR15,1 point,Wed May 13 16:19:57 2015 UTC,How do you pull off being on the gas and throttle at once?
dirtgame,35u4s9,xLarkins,1 point,Wed May 13 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"By not doing it. Lack of left foot braking is more hurtful in other sims. On those I set a secondary brake on some button. Here? Cars bleed too much speed, I tried it with my wheel. Didn't feel a real need for it in this particular game with my driving style, might not apply for everyone.  EDIT: I've been using this controller since I started playing sims btw. Worse than the wheel at those, but surprisingly close performance on some of them..."
dirtgame,35u4s9,XJR15,2,Wed May 13 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. I find the hardest part of using a controller is holiding a slight turn for a period of time, like trying to correct a but before a crest/jump to hit the landing well. Makes Greece especially difficult."
dirtgame,35u4s9,xLarkins,1 point,Wed May 13 20:11:39 2015 UTC,"I agree on that! It's difficult to do that while not letting off the throttle, I feel like I lose speed every time that happens.  What I like to do in RWD and AWD is get the car to oversteer slightly. Pretty hard on long sweeping corners in AWDs; what I do with them is take the corner from the inside or middle, let the car go outside a bit then steering in, which will generally make me oversteer without using anything that will lose me speed.  The point of all that oversteer talk is that while drifting a bit it's much easier to correct for those kinds of jump/crest/bump without stopping acceleration. Greece is a bit of an asshole place, especially in the group B cars, as there's tons of bumps and crests and don't-cuts that the codriver doesn't bother to call (I guess because they're constant :P)"
dirtgame,35u4s9,XJR15,2,Thu May 14 06:22:25 2015 UTC,"I turned the sensitivity all the way down to zero for the 360 controller. Otherwise, I found it far too twitchy, particularly at high speed."
dirtgame,35u4s9,FunkyJunk,1 point,Wed May 13 16:45:27 2015 UTC,I turned the sensitivity down as well for my Xbox One controller. The default was to twitchy at high speeds. Really helped turninh it down.
dirtgame,35u4s9,Agentofsociety,1 point,Wed May 13 19:54:21 2015 UTC,what are u running a 50/30 setup?
dirtgame,35u4s9,Agentofsociety,3,Wed May 13 21:33:36 2015 UTC,30 sensitivity 10 linearity  This way the car stopped swaying when at top speeds and I can adjust it smoother and more detailed over corners and thight roads.
dirtgame,35u4s9,akmp40,-10,Thu May 14 02:55:19 2015 UTC,That would be to got to the preference options and getting a wheel.
dirtgame,35t9kk,adyrhan,3,Wed May 13 09:16:43 2015 UTC,"As a pedal to the metal kinda guy it goes against my nature to say this, but slow down alot on ice with those early-game rides, it'll show on the clock. Breaking earlier and taking it real easy around icy bends does it for me, as soon as I get cocky I end up belly-up in the snow or go down a cliff and I always get cocky on ice. :-)"
dirtgame,35t9kk,vajb,1 point,Wed May 13 10:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the only thing that sort of does the bends, but man. It kind of goes against my nature too, I use to take slow bends a bit slower than I think I can do because I know I can start to accelerate earlier in the apex to exit the bend quicker than those pushing the car to the limit on the bend, but on ice it looks like its enter the corner sloowly and when you have exit the corner and the car is completely straight then accelerate. And it looks and feels like grandma driving :D Also shows in the time, I can't get to 3rd position driving that way. Now I see clean asphalt when snow and ice ends and is like seeing an oasis xD"
dirtgame,35t9kk,Crushker,2,Wed May 13 10:55:18 2015 UTC,I just finally found the speed in the quattro on ice. It seems if I go into a corner really slowly and just play with the throttle it pulls it self out pretty good. Finally got some stage wins in Monte!
dirtgame,35t9kk,vajb,2,Wed May 13 11:08:25 2015 UTC,"The Quattro was the first vehicle I felt in control with and still fast on the ice, takes 4wd I guess - but not until a few upgrades has been made. :P"
dirtgame,35t9kk,XJR15,1 point,Wed May 13 11:44:04 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, with the same car and the 70's Escort. The one thing that made a HUGE difference was braking veeeery lightly, you can't let the rear lose all the weight on it and, thus, traction. Cornering you can do while feeling out the grip, it's just like tarmac but much less grippy. Corner exits are rarely a problem even with full throttle, the Sierra grips well there if you're ready to go full lock countersteer in half a second :P  Just avoid sudden and large weight transitions, especially from rear to front when braking, that's the one that always kills me."
dirtgame,35t9kk,dgeesio,1 point,Wed May 13 12:19:09 2015 UTC,best to just do a few runs on the snow tracks and practice. keep it steady for a start and you'll gradually learn where you can push and pick up time.   some Monaco tracks i can win by 5-10 secs some upto 30.
dirtgame,35t9kk,snoozieboi,1 point,Wed May 13 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"My best advice would be only tiny adjustments to the wheel, keep the car as straight as possible. I only countersteer out of hairpins, most is just tiny adjustments of direction. Powerslides are key to passing most turns quickly and you need to get in a mindset where you start sliding well before the turn, or at least quite early.     For turns, get the car pointing inwards before hitting the apex, if you still understeer, tap the handbrake to adjust. If you oversteer easily on exit, either accelerate more softly or set difflock to ""looser"".   Still I'm also experimenting with a very clean Loeb/Ogier style with many cars, minimum sliding, just going wide, hitting the apex and accelerate."
dirtgame,35t9kk,xLarkins,1 point,Wed May 13 13:54:35 2015 UTC,Generally on AWD cars and any turn under 3 I use the handbrake pretty early to start turning. On ice once you use the handbrake you will continue to rotate until you apply throttle/counter steer. Pretty helpful for when you feel like you can't turn
dirtgame,35t9kk,Cuon,1 point,Wed May 13 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I can't fucking stand some of the hairpin crowd boundaries on the Monte tracks. Even if you just barely clip the yellow ribbon fences, the game automatically resets you regardless of how close you get to the crowd. It's also really annoying to go a mile an hour too fast and slide over a snow-covered guard wall for an insta-DQ"
dirtgame,35tqfx,QazRa,1 point,Wed May 13 13:02:20 2015 UTC,"Newcomer to Reddit in general, so I hope I did everything correctly! I have lurked around here for quite some time though.  Having played the game for a week and now two events down in 2010 Masters championships, I have to say this game is absolutely everything I have hoped for in a rally game. Never played any other ""Hardcore"" rally games like RBR or any circuit racers. Only experience is with DiRT 2/3, with the latter being a game I played way too much with the 360 pad and at times with my trusty old Microsoft(!) Sidewinder, yes the one Circa 1999...  Can't wait for more countries and cars! Codemasters, if you're reading this; keep up the very good work!  Edit. Just remembered that I played Colin McRae Rally 2 way back when I was like 8 years old with my dad and with this same exact wheel. Oh the nostalgia.."

He asked if he could play,  So I sat him down and let him race. He still has it!.... almost. So its been a really fun week because it's like old times with my father. It might not be much to some people but its really cool to have flashbacks to your childhood with your Parents, that rarely happens, so its been a super fun week as we have been racing together.  So thanks DiRT/ Codemasters for making me :)  PS - All I ask is you create a time trial mode so I can race my dad's ghost and he can set times while I am away!"

dirtgame,35p5r2,justbiglee,6,Tue May 12 11:09:34 2015 UTC,"We just set another small patch live for DiRT Rally which should hopefully reduce the number of Error 41 messages which some users are experiencing.   Since we started working on the problem we’ve come to learn that there are apparently a few different causes of this particular error code and as a result we know we won’t have fixed it for everybody.   We’re estimating today’s patch should work for about 40-50% of players who experience it, which is good because it means we’re finally breaking the back of this thing, but it also kinda sucks for those who are still having the issue.   We’re not finished with this though, we’ll continue to work on it and we still need your help tracking it down so if you do still experience the issue after today’s patch. Please let us know, you’ll find more info in the technical support forums. Thank you to everybody who helped us test this patch over the weekend.   We’ve also made a change to the Weekly Event so rather than waiting for stages to unlock as the week goes on you can now take on the whole thing in one go or at your own pace.   Outside of the game we’ve made some changes to dirtgame.com and you will now be able to view the leaderboards for past Daily, Weekly and Monthly Events.   We’ve also updated the Steam Store page to make what spec rig you will need to run DiRT Rally clearer, we haven’t changed the minimum spec but we’ve had some people asking us questions like “will my XXX graphics card work”.   So we’ve added in a list of graphics card [see below] which we know work with DiRT Rally. This isn’t a complete list but it is the most common cards, if yours isn’t listed or if you are unsure you’ll need to check that your card is a DirectX 11 graphics card. You’ll normally find this info on the manufacturer’s website.   Coming up next we’re continuing to work on bug fixes, FFB, Pikes Peak and more. Keep an eye out for this week’s Road Book blog post later this week for more info and don’t forget to follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook for the latest news   Edit: List of graphics cards from the store page   Supported Graphics Cards: AMD HD5000 Series, HD6000 Series, HD7000 Series, R7 Series, R9 Series Nvidia GTX400 Series, GTX500 Series, GTX600 Series, GTX700 Series, GTX900 Series Intel HD4000 Series, HD5000 Series"

Maybe there's a few things you could pick up.  https://youtu.be/QnPuk2ECaIQ  I don't have much advice for you except to brake earlier, think about getting the car rotating to help you through the corners, and maybe even disable TC and stability control as they'll probably just cause understeer."

dirtgame,35s7w8,Testikulaer,1 point,Wed May 13 23:14:51 2015 UTC,I have tried them both individually and never together but I feel I just cant stick to the track and keep the car straight.
dirtgame,35s7w8,HerpDerpenberg,2,Wed May 13 02:23:21 2015 UTC,"The key with RWD cars is throttle control. You can't mash the gas all the time like the FWD and AWD cars.  You're using the throttle to help rotate the car. You'll also realize a rotation point that no matter how much steering you cannot recover.    Only go full throttle when you have the car pointed in the direction you want to go.  If you watch the WRC guy, he sets op for turns early and commits to the notes, you need to think a head to set up the car and not drove what you see."
dirtgame,35s7w8,jonwah,4,Wed May 13 12:05:41 2015 UTC,"It's a bloody hard car to drive.. It really depends on the surface, but if you're on gravel, try braking early & light, and then just before the corner, give it a bit heavier braking while turning in slightly - this should kick the ass out and point your nose through the corner, ready to be back (lightly!) on the gas..  I've only seriously driven a few of the cars, and so far it's the most difficult; especially when it's sliding and you're trying to put throttle down.. it's all about control, just keep that right foot light!  Edit: Forgot to mention I drive with stability, abs + traction control all off; I have no idea what this thing feels like with them on."
dirtgame,35s7w8,TheHoffe,2,Wed May 13 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the BMW but I'm really starting to get along with the RWD Sierra. Right now it's the most rewarding car to drive. It took a while and buying a wheel/pedals before controlling oversteer throughout the long corners was doable though. I took the RWD class at Dirtfish and I try to apply everything I learned there, and it's working out quite well. Make sure the car is stable before you apply throttle, keep some weight on the front wheels to not understeer too badly, etc.  Not saying you need to do a $1500 trip to Seattle to have fun with the BMW, just that you'll get rewarded if you keep practicing. :)"
dirtgame,35s7w8,timythenerd,2,Wed May 13 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJB8BtkSEHM  Watch how Snijers rotates the car just as he is getting on power (so he's not yet facing in the right direction, but the handbrake and power at the same time rotates the car to exactly where he wants it.). And just how early he has to brake."
dirtgame,35s7w8,XJR15,2,Wed May 13 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"I tried both the Sierra and BMW, and the Sierra felt much better for me, even with the anemic 1st gear before you get the advanced setup upgrade. The BMW required too much of a light touch for me. Try the Sierra in a custom game if you want, maybe switching will be worth it?"
dirtgame,35s7w8,Crushker,1 point,Wed May 13 06:45:14 2015 UTC,Brake earlier and practice using light throttle coming out of the corners. Just kind of feather it coming out of tight corners.
dirtgame,35s7w8,GuitarManiacs,1 point,Wed May 13 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'm having a bugger of a time with the car as well, but the more stages I run the better it gets.  Also the more stages I run the more upgrades will end up on the car, so that helps too."
dirtgame,35s7w8,corndog67,1 point,Wed May 13 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"For me it was all about the gearing.  If you set up advanced settings in the gearbox.

I recommend to take off all the assists and really learn how the car really handles.  It was well said in RBR ""you need to go slow to go fast""  meaning that it gets you much better time when you drive a bit slower trough course than if you drive insanely fast and crash every corner and its better to brake too early than too late."

I feel like if you do most of your breakings and turns half a second earlier, it would be a lot better - that's the whole point of the co-driver, and rallying as a sport - to react to the road before you see it.

dirtgame,35oseq,mazdarati2,2,Tue May 12 10:35:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, some of the jumps and offroad shenanigans that can be gotten away with should be killing the suspension."
dirtgame,35oseq,snoozieboi,3,Tue May 12 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, major difference to RBR and DR is that I am afraid of dying in RBR while in DR i drive with a resting pulse at full speed.    I definitely commend Codies for going more in the sim direction, but I guess they have to keep the casual fans (I regard myself as a casual gamer too, really) to not break their wheels in rage.     Don't get me wrong, I am super addicted to the speed and sense of mastery even if I know I should have flown of the road quite a few places here and there. Or that I died hitting that tree. The online leagues and challenges also kept me up until 1.30 am because I couldn't stop.    I just hope they release mod tools so a community like RSRBR can grow and mod the game. Codies will still sell the platform and content."
dirtgame,35oseq,HerpDerpenberg,3,Tue May 12 10:41:34 2015 UTC,"Since you haven't mentioned it, you do not have rally experience? With regard to your braking on gravel, you'd be surprised how much grip you get while braking on gravel.  You actually brake better when you're not threshold braking and you brake better when you're coming in at an angle.  When you brake and lock the wheels, you're dragging on the road surface. When you do this you're cutting down through the loose dirt/gravel on the surface and hitting hard road.  The loose surface builds up in front of your tires and slows you down as well.  When you brake in a straight line, only your front wheels are doing the digging, your rears follow the path of the front. Compare this to sliding, you have the sidewalls of the tire digging in and now all 4 tires are doing it.  You can have drastic surface changes depending on road type and weather. In Wales on damp roads, you have a slick mud on top and hard/dry dirt below.  You'd actually have more grip staying in the tracks of cars ahead of you as they already cleared the slick layer off.  On other stages you look for brake points of cars when they dig in and they can be advantageous as a following driver.  This is why on an event with a loose top surface, running further down the start order is an advantage as you are not clearing the road for competitors behind you.   Personally, I feel the tarmac is a bit too floaty and the cars have more snap over/understeer when tarmac rally tires have a more gradual breakaway on traction to have a more predictable limit."
dirtgame,35oseq,HerpDerpenberg,3,Tue May 12 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"Nope, no rally experience, trying to change this but the funds aren't there.  This is good information!"
dirtgame,35oseq,chukolna,1 point,Tue May 12 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not much more than what you can spend on running some road racing series. You only need a basic 2WD car (MKII/III golf, Honda Civic, Dodge Neon, E30/E36 BMW) a roll cage, seats (if you have fia seat in your race car you can reuse that) and some underbody protection with Bilstein HD dampers with ~50% stiffer springs than stock and you're good to go.  You can find used rally cars for under $6,000 quite often.  You've already got the $1000 of safety equipment you wear (Helmet/HANS/Suit)"
dirtgame,35oseq,greatestname,2,Tue May 12 18:14:27 2015 UTC,We have put a ton of thought into it. My shop mate is even trying to trade a weekend in his car for a day in someone elses.  Im not saying it wont happen. But this year all of my money went into building a new engine. So 6 grand of disposable income may take a minute to come by.
dirtgame,35oseq,jar0ne,2,Tue May 12 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Great read, i want to hear your thoughts on rest of the sims you played, well mainly on Iracing and AC, Pcars, rF."
dirtgame,35oseq,freedomweasel,2,Tue May 12 11:28:45 2015 UTC,"IRacing is by far my favorite and easily the one I have dumped the most time into. There are things missing (marbles, weather, good tire degradation, punctures, flat spots, rubbering in of the surface, things are a lot bumpier if you go off track irl) , but overall its the closest you are going to get to the real thing without doing the real thing.  Assetto Corsa is also enjoyable, but in a frustrating way. There are a handful of cars I want to drive and a bunch more I stay far away from. The mods make this game a nice addition.  rFactor should be used as a track learning tool only. I know there is a cult following for the sim side, but I don't find it at all realistic. I use it to memorize the track before I go to it in real life. Its proved to be useful.  I haven't played pCARS enough to really formulate an opinion..."
dirtgame,35oseq,firish,2,Tue May 12 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"EDIT: forgot to mention damage. You are going to easy on us codemasters! If i skim a tree, chances are its going to ruin the suspension if not rip the wheels off.   I would find that way too frustrating."
dirtgame,35oseq,freedomweasel,5,Tue May 12 09:11:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should play something more arcade then? I thought they were going to make this car sim, not another dirt 3."
dirtgame,35oseq,Artie-Choke,17,Tue May 12 11:28:31 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, a simple slider in the options."
dirtgame,35oseq,thinsoldier,2,Tue May 12 11:41:10 2015 UTC,This is exactly what needs to happen. Give people the option to run different levels of damage to suit their tastes.
dirtgame,35oseq,greatestname,3,Tue May 12 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"Never understood why people are so against options and sliders.  I want more damage, so I turn that up, I want easier AI, so I turn that down.  Maybe you're the opposite.  Now two people will be happy to buy the game, and give them money."
dirtgame,35oseq,capnbard,5,Tue May 12 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"Because it makes them more bad-ass to excel at something no one else can even play.  It's unfortunate that the ""hard-core"" gamers often out-shout everyone else.  Slider options should make everyone happy."
dirtgame,35oseq,Fastco,1 point,Tue May 12 16:26:01 2015 UTC,That mentality goes beyond gaming. In the early days of OSX people were against all kinds of features that they considered windowsy or linuxy even if they could be completely ignored or disabled or off by default.

dirtgame,35oseq,Artie-Choke,-1,Tue May 12 11:37:02 2015 UTC,Then maybe you don't want a SIM.
dirtgame,35oseq,Lryder2k6,-1,Tue May 12 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but there are plenty of arcadeish type rally games out there while most of the sim crowd still plays Richard Burns Rally(a game that came out in 2004/5). We just want something to cater more towards our style because it seems like there are a plethora of arcadey racing games out there already, why make another right now?"
dirtgame,35oseq,greatestname,1 point,Tue May 12 14:27:06 2015 UTC,"I want a rally game that has great driving physics, that controls well with a wheel. The arcadey games just fall flat in that regard. And I also want to game to be somewhat forgiving so that you do not total the car every time you make a small mistake and ""skim a tree"" as in the example given. That is just too much an exercise in frustration.  If the game were able to accomplish great realism in all regards, none of us would be even able to drive most of the cars in a simulated championship. It is not like all you need to be a WRC class driver is a few hours practice."
dirtgame,35oseq,Fastco,1 point,Tue May 12 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"Also, something to take into consideration:  It's a simulation, not real life.  You have to have forgiving controls and physics because you just can't get the feel and control you get in a real car.  Case in point: I can sit and do donuts in my RL car all day long, but damn if I can get my car in Dirt3 to do it easily.  To that point, not every player is going to have a $1000 wheel/chair/pedal set up in an attempt to get close to decent control - and even then, still have to relearn everything to compensate."
dirtgame,35oseq,XJR15,1 point,Tue May 12 17:04:27 2015 UTC,Why can't we have both?  Could just make enabling realistic damage give a bonus to rewards like the other difficulty settings.

dirtgame,35ngte,Agentofsociety,2,Tue May 12 02:02:25 2015 UTC,That's mainly due to the FOV and camera position
dirtgame,35ngte,marts30,2,Tue May 12 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"You can see here  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.984281,7.349286,3a,15y,101.3h,91.08t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sWMFvBhdbz5F9qH-RQBsFKQ!2e0  or here  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.984237,7.35692,3a,75y,302.65h,82.36t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1satnOnJP40993yL_BtQTXDA!2e0  how wide the roads are. That truck in the second link is about 2,6 meters wide (2,8 including the mirrors). Street View cars are around 2 meters wide. The car managed to get past the truck just fine, which means the road is about 5 meters wide. So not super wide, but not too bad either, and pretty much exactly like in the game."
dirtgame,35ngte,justbiglee,2,Tue May 12 03:00:25 2015 UTC,Wow this is awesome! Top detective work :)
dirtgame,35ngte,Crushker,2,Tue May 12 12:04:49 2015 UTC,"Well, you made it quite easy, the tracks do correspond really well to their real counterparts, including the trackside objects and views. (Also, let's be honest, Pra d'Alart was probably the easiest to do.)  I'd do more (I'm always interested in this sort of thing - it's interesting to see what made it to the game, what was left out, how things changed and why...), but there's no Street View for Wales stages (there's only a part of River Severn Valley photographed, and even that is on the opposite bank of the river, not the actual road where the stage is set) and I still have no real clue where the Greek stages are and/or if they are actually real or just ""inspired by"" - I have a general idea of the area, but beyond that... Then again, given what kind of roads they are, even if they're real, there's not likely to be Street View coverage."
dirtgame,35o3h9,gaspermat,9,Tue May 12 02:14:10 2015 UTC,"My thoughts based on game and real life experience:  1- For the first flick you'll probably be on the brakes or just coasting. I think I'm usually still finishing my braking during this part. For the flick into the turn I'll usually be coasting.  2- Depends on the turn and whether you came in too slow, too fast, etc. With a RWD or AWD car you should be accelerating during the turn. With FWD you may need to wait longer before accelerating again since accelerating will tend to straighten out the car, unless you can left foot brake at the same time to keep the car rotating.  3- Early parts are the same regardless of drivetrain, but as mentioned before, how you accelerate and when in the corner will change. AWD can get back on the power the soonest and the hardest to power slide through the corner and claw yourself out of the corner. RWD can get on soon as well but maybe not as hard since you risk spinning out with too much power. Apply opposite lock as needed to counter steer while accelerating. With FWD, accelerating tends to straighten out the car, so you'll need to wait longer unless you can LFB like I mentioned above."
dirtgame,35o3h9,Raptord,1 point,Tue May 12 02:31:38 2015 UTC,"Very well explained! Especially the drivetrain differences :) . I'll just add that one can slow down in the second flick into the corner and tighten the turn if needed, if while transitioning you brake a bit (or a lot, if you're confident you won't lock the tires!). Useful for hairpins if you don't want to brake much earlier in the first flick. It's also useful to get an AWD really sideways for a power slide in a tight turn.  In this game it seems like it's a bit harder to throw the car's weight around than in simulators, I'll rarely flick in 4 and upwards fast corners, whereas in RBR I'd be flicking in everything but 6 corners quite often."
dirtgame,35o3h9,XJR15,1 point,Tue May 12 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"Welp, saved me a few minutes worth of typing. This is a pretty solid explanation of everything you asked. Ultimately, it all depends on the drivetrain and the turn you're going into. Sometimes you'll need to brake into it other times you can tickle the throttle and then let it rip throughout the turn. Just keep practicing brotha, you'll get it down. Also, the different surfaces will change the way you perform this drastically! Good luck"
dirtgame,35o3h9,MADACE404,0,Tue May 12 07:51:30 2015 UTC,That's exactly the type of advice I was looking for. Thanks a lot.
dirtgame,35o3h9,Crushker,3,Tue May 12 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"Here's the steps i take in my real car/ rbr. I add handbrake in Dirt because I get heavy understeer.   Alright when I get to the corner I'll move towards the inside (right side for right turn) brake hard (get the weight on the front tires) steer away from the corner. When the car starts to slide the away from the corner, I steer back towards the turn while giving enough throttle to kick the car back around the opposite direction. (This includes clutch kicking) If I had too much speed I may brake to keep from sliding too far out. If you did it right the car should have entered the corner sliding so just modulate the throttle to keep the car moving through and out of the corner. Depending on the direction of the turn and its tightness you may have to add handbrake/downshifts and double flicks."
dirtgame,35o3h9,deadstump,2,Tue May 12 02:31:23 2015 UTC,Wrong side of the road Brake Release Turn out (let it hook up not just a flick of the wheel) Straight (momentarily) Brake (just a dab) Turn in Wait (you should be sideways at this point) See the exit... still wait accelerating at this point will loop or cause understeer Line up... go   I think that is how I do it.  4-7 happen rather quickly.

dirtgame,35o4ch,Raptord,1 point,Tue May 12 02:21:24 2015 UTC,Another post I saw about this speculated that it's a co-driver mistake. As if he misread the notes or marked the turn down incorrectly in the pre-race drive.
dirtgame,35o4ch,zuma93,2,Tue May 12 05:06:24 2015 UTC,"I've run multiple courses (nothing I can specify) and I could've sworn I've heard mistakes in my co-drivers call outs, turns in the wrong range or saying left rather than right, etc.  It would be interesting if co-drivers notes could've been wrong and were to relay said mistakes."
dirtgame,35o4ch,akthunder73,4,Tue May 12 07:06:51 2015 UTC,"I sometimes hear him ""stutter"", but it's always a split second and I'm never sure it's not my imagination. What I'm 100% sure of is that the time he takes to read a note varies. I had to restart a stage a few times, and sometimes I'd eat the right 3 before he finished calling it, and others he'd call it well ahead of time (this is with pacenotes on the earliest setting). I'd be going the same speed every try, so it's not like he had more time because I was going slower. Weird."
dirtgame,35o4ch,XJR15,2,Tue May 12 07:39:36 2015 UTC,"Can verify the stuttering, I've also run into instances where I've run the course faster than he can keep up."

Can be more readily found for <$100 because they are less desirable. 240 degree rotation isn't that bad, and on the plus side, requires less turning overall. Means you can get all of the cars steering capability much quicker. I use a MOMO and I run the Stratos without problems."

dirtgame,35l2ik,Ghrackle,1 point,Mon May 11 11:17:14 2015 UTC,Codemasters has set up a suggestion box on steam.  There's also one on their forums if you have an account there.
dirtgame,35l2ik,withoutapaddle,1 point,Mon May 11 12:35:03 2015 UTC,"It might not be as simple as you think.  For example, having the option to go to a drone camera at any time would require the entire stage to have a drone path, orientation, field of view, etc programmed for that camera at every moment of the stage.  It would be cool, but most full games do not have 3rd person camera placements for all sections of every track.  I wouldn't expect this from a full game, let alone an early access game.  I think there are a lot more pressing issues to fix and more important content to add right now."
dirtgame,35l2ik,jtr99,1 point,Mon May 11 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"Further to this suggestion, it would be great to have a replay setting that used only external cameras (drone, helicopter and stationary trackside cameras).  Personally I find that when I am watching a replay, I'm tempted to fast-forward anything from a car-mounted camera.  I feel as though I've already seen that angle while driving the stage, and now want to see what my car looked like to spectators.  Curious to know whether anyone else feels the same way on this one."
dirtgame,35l2cl,Olemartin111,7,Mon May 11 11:14:36 2015 UTC,I try to change gears to match the situation.  In really low grip areas (mud & ice) I'll switch at lower rpms so that my car isn't reaching full torque so quickly and I can hold on to more traction.
dirtgame,35l2cl,Lari-Fari,8,Mon May 11 12:39:26 2015 UTC,This exactly. I don't think perfectly timed shifts matter that much in this game. Its more about already being in the right gear for any given situation.
dirtgame,35l2cl,HerpDerpenberg,3,Mon May 11 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Redline for the most part. Turbo cars will have better low end torque and (group a and wrc cars) will run out of steam higher in the revs because of their intake restrictor.   But low speed corners you want torque, high speed you want HP. NA cars you want them on the boil because all their torque and power is on the top end."
dirtgame,35l2cl,dawguk,1 point,Mon May 11 19:17:54 2015 UTC,The BMW sounds much nicer when you short shift!
dirtgame,35l2cl,PirateMud,1 point,Mon May 11 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"Varies by car and situation. I do try to make sure though that I tune the gears to avoid situations like the stock gearing on the Sierra RS500 (80's RWD) where 2nd gear is so long compared to 1st that changing at the red line from first into 2nd causes the engine to drop off boost... but only when I need to avoid that situation. I have a number of top 30 times on a range of stages with mainly the Mini and I have only ever altered the diff settings there, so I think that most gains at the moment are to be gained by driving skill, and then tuning will shine through when we've reached the limit of stock tuning's performance."
dirtgame,35l2cl,kindaallovertheplace,1 point,Mon May 11 22:42:45 2015 UTC,I think they set it so that in general they like high revs. Look at the car info and it says at what RPM you will be getting the most horsepower. Going above that is no use.
dirtgame,35l2cl,_Bilas,6,Mon May 11 11:16:23 2015 UTC,"Untrue, usually you get best average horsepower by going slightly above peak horsepower RPM."
dirtgame,35l2cl,Thuraash,2,Mon May 11 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The optimal change point is when the new gear will be making more power than the current one. That depends on both the high and low end of the curve.   In the Stratos, for example, my gut feel is that you can short-shift through the 2-3-4 shifts, but the Dino engine is terrible below 5K RPM. Thus, you want to take your time with 1 and also 5 because if you shift 4-5 even a little short you fall out of the power-band.  I usually shift 2-3-4 anytime at or after the striped area, but go damn near the redline for 4-5."
dirtgame,35l2cl,_Bilas,2,Mon May 11 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"That all changes when you unlock advanced tuning, where you can change the individual gear ratios. With the Stratos, I like having a longer first gear, similarly spaced 2-4, and a longer 5 for some of the huge straights in Greece and Wales."
dirtgame,35l2cl,kindaallovertheplace,1 point,Mon May 11 21:50:52 2015 UTC,Shouldn't it say max horsepower at that RPM then?
dirtgame,35l2cl,_Bilas,8,Mon May 11 13:10:58 2015 UTC,"Peak horsepower is the RPM which your engine is producing max power in that particular instant. But horsepower is a curve, which slowly builds up to peak power then drops off when you go beyond peak power.  The trick is to push slightly beyond peak power, then shift. This puts you higher up the curve in your next gear, and ensures better average power throughout.   Usually, unless your peak power is within 100 RPM (not 1000, 100) of redline, you don't want to go all the way to the rev limit; make sure you shift before you hit the limit, in some cars way before, such as the Impreza."
dirtgame,35l2cl,kindaallovertheplace,1 point,Mon May 11 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all i was thinking was to shift up before you drop too much power after peak. Like if you are chasing a corner you will much more like to stay on gear than to shift and immediately have to shift down again."
dirtgame,35l2cl,_Bilas,3,Mon May 11 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, there is situational shifting as well, you don't want to upshift just to downshift half a second later, no point as you don't get to apply power then."
dirtgame,35l2cl,Lryder2k6,1 point,Mon May 11 13:47:02 2015 UTC,Is it implemented in Dirt Rally like this?
dirtgame,35l2cl,Lari-Fari,1 point,Mon May 11 15:55:25 2015 UTC,One way to put it is that you want to be running in the range of RPMs that gives you the greatest area under the power curve.
dirtgame,35l2cl,kindaallovertheplace,3,Mon May 11 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"Nope. It should say max HP RPM at exactly the RPM that ""peak HP"" occurs on.  And yeah you should go a bit above that before shifting."
dirtgame,35l2cl,Lari-Fari,2,Mon May 11 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, my bad.  :)"
dirtgame,35mia5,Mister_Akuma,2,Mon May 11 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"Make sure the wheel is plugged in before starting the game. When you see the menu, hit the OK button on the wheel/shifter you bound.

dirtgame,35mia5,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Mon May 11 19:13:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip!   I always plug my wheel before I start the game, but as I am not playing with my shifter plugged in I cant press the OK button, because it is bound by default to a button (16 or 18 if I recall correctly) which is not on the steering wheel, I assume its one on the shifter.  There doesn't seem to be a menu to bind the OK key, or at least I'm not seeing it on the options menu. I can only change look left/right, shift, recover vehicle, pause, etc, but not the OK, Back, Replay, etc keys.  Thanks again for the reply!"
dirtgame,35mia5,HerpDerpenberg,2,Mon May 11 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah the button is the lower black button above the D pad on the shifter.  Either way, the game shouldn't default to a keyboard of you hit enter and hopefully they fix this."

I know it wasn't stated that the game only runs on DirectX 11 hardware, but they edited the requirements when they realised it was a problem:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/310560/discussions/0/613956964590330082/#c613957600526484519  Given that it wasn't explicitly stated as a requirement previously, you should be able to request a refund through Steam, or possibly check if Codemasters can do it themselves. I do think they should issue an official apology about the previous ambiguity, though."

OP - It's cool don't worry - hopefully we've got a really good mix of daily events and as the game grows we'll be adding the new stages and cars into rotation too.

Could some kind redditor explain like im five how to join the leagues?
dirtgame,35kza5,madman_ozzy,2,Mon May 11 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"To join a league, you need a RaceNet account (at dirtgame.com, you may have already made one in-game), and then link that to your steam account (should be an option somewhere at the site). Then just go to any league page and click join! That league will then appear in-game."
dirtgame,35kza5,madman_ozzy,1 point,Mon May 11 21:26:38 2015 UTC,Ive joined racenet and linked it with my steam account but when i am at a league page i can see all events but theres no button to join.
dirtgame,35kza5,madman_ozzy,2,Tue May 12 04:32:43 2015 UTC,"That's weird. When I'm logged in and go to a league site, I see a blue ""Join League"" button right on the description box on the right.  Maybe in a different browser? Is the RaceNet account linked to the correct steam account? And what if you search the league name in the ""Find a League"" box, and join from there? (there should be a button on that page too)"
dirtgame,35kza5,madman_ozzy,1 point,Tue May 12 10:24:52 2015 UTC,Ive tried both the browser built into steam and chrome. My racenet profile is linked to my steam account.

dirtgame,35k5oi,viiceviice,24,Mon May 11 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"For me, 12 rounds is way too much time to commit for league(takes over an hour to complete the stages).   I'd love to have 4 round leagues every other day or just 2 rounds per day league. 12 rounds of the same map just feels like grinding.   I love to complete a league at one go and one hour is just too much."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Zeali,4,Mon May 11 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'll just piggy back this since I have similar issues with 12 stages in 2 days.  12 stages is OK if there's variance and enough time to do the event. The the last one was all day/clear stages. The time frame is way to short and requires ~1 hour time.  For comparison, look at the daily/weekly/monthly challenges Codemasters runs. Single day should still be a single stage.  Weekly 4-6 stages. Biweekly 12 stages and month long events 24 stages.  If they want to run 2 day events, I'd suggest 2-3 stages.  That way, in a week you've run 6-9 stages.  I get it, we want more endurance events, but in real rally you typically race once a month on a championship. Running 12 stages every 2 days is a lot."
dirtgame,35k5oi,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Mon May 11 13:58:45 2015 UTC,Well in a real rally they are usually 2 days long and composed of multiple stages. Its not uncommon to do 6-8 stages a day that are as long as our longest or longer.
dirtgame,35k5oi,HerpDerpenberg,7,Mon May 11 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"Well in a real rally they are usually 2 days long and composed of multiple stages.    And WRC rallies are run on weekends. Typically with 3-4 weeks between events. Not every 2 days. Just because people run marathons doesn't mean you should run them. Let alone run then bi-daily.  We're amateur sim really drivers. If someone wants to run 12 stages every 2 days there should be a specific league. The trials were 6 stages of I recall? I don't remember a discussion on event length and time between events.  I'm fine for 24 stage events, but give me a month to complete those, like they do on the monthly challenge. It's not a matter of completing 12 the stages in 2 days, as you need an hour of time, it's finding when a good time to block out a dedicated hour to do so.    I'm running 4 leagues right now and I'm skipping this reddit one for now, because I ran 11/12 on the first event and then the event expired on me. Now that I missed an event, being competitive for the championship is out the window.   Its not uncommon to do 6-8 stages a day that are as long as our longest or longer.   It's also likely more common to have regional events with shorter stages over a single day, run over a month.  I'd love long stages as well, but it's different modeling a 4 mile grand prix circuit to run a 1.5 hour long race than it is to model 100+ miles of unique stage roads."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Zeali,1 point,Mon May 11 15:23:10 2015 UTC,This is all understandable. I wasnt saying codies should do this either. We all know its a game (not quite sim level yet)
dirtgame,35k5oi,QuitoPR,1 point,Tue May 12 06:42:01 2015 UTC,"I understand that and i usually drive 4-12 stages a a day, but you have to understand that those stages include daily, weekly and championship mode, not only one league with one car.  To give some perspective to my driving habits, i start the day with couple of custom races, head to championship to drive 4-8 stages and then complete daily/weekly challenge and reddit league.  Then i head to play other games as day can be as long as it is. For people who only play DiRT Rally, 12 stages in two days is ok but for many, it's too much."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Case_f,1 point,Mon May 11 15:31:40 2015 UTC,That being said. Even I have an issue with the time commitment.
dirtgame,35k5oi,gravidos,1 point,Mon May 11 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"For me, the time commitment is only half of it. The other half is the lack of variety. This is not an issue with the league but rather the game in its current state.   I just don't feel motivated to replay the same stages that I've been playing tirelessly in Career mode trying to progress right now. I see myself being more interested in the league when there's a better chance of racing a track/condition combo that I haven't raced in my last few sessions."
dirtgame,35k5oi,orzeuu,1 point,Tue May 12 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"12 stages is a bit too much, really. I like to finish the league in one go as well, and 60+ minutes is really pushing it. This time especially I was just praying for the league to finish - I've instantly regretted taking the Escort for a spin and I was really struggling to keep it at least somewhat under control. 60+ minutes of pure frustration. Do not recommend, would not drive again.  6 stages would be much more enjoyable, I think."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Quallen,9,Mon May 11 23:29:46 2015 UTC,2 Days isn't really long enough for most people is my guess.  I didn't take part in wave 2 and probably won't touch wave 3 because I'm more interested in unlocking stuff with the time I have to play the game.
dirtgame,35k5oi,Harmonic_Series,7,Mon May 11 03:47:59 2015 UTC,I agree that 2 days is way too intensive. 5-7 days would be more encouraging I believe.
dirtgame,35k5oi,HerpDerpenberg,2,Mon May 11 04:34:05 2015 UTC,Yeah the first time I completed the league I has assumed it was 5-7 day event and I was just late to the party so I powered through. Can't believe I'm saying this but the short time frame is just to hardcore for me right now. With my limited time I'd rather do the daily and a few career races most days
dirtgame,35k5oi,mess8,3,Mon May 11 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"The current round started just a few hours ago I believe.  And I do think also that 2 days is too short, especially for 12 stage events. I have a 9-5 job and only so much free time. At the current pace, I'd spend almost half my free time with just this league alone, never mind other leagues, single player, other games, and everything else."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Merkinz,2,Mon May 11 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"I'm running 4 leagues  now, soon to be 5. Between that, daily/weekly/monthly challenges, career mode, playing other video games and having other stuff to do, I have a lot on my plate."
dirtgame,35k5oi,Ghrackle,2,Mon May 11 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"A shorter (6 stages) league or maybe a longer time period would be better. I just grinded out this event and it took me quite a long time, so I see how many people can't commit to that.  sidenote: Finnish people are OP even online."

dirtgame,35itm0,Crushker,4,Mon May 11 00:29:18 2015 UTC,100% support this idea. It'd be pretty sweet to drift into that finish point with the cameras flashing after that long stage.
dirtgame,35itm0,Lari-Fari,2,Mon May 11 03:41:55 2015 UTC,This could also get super annoying. For the finish line maybe. but not all over the track please. It would be super frustrating to miss a corner after having been blinded by flashes ;P
dirtgame,35itm0,Lari-Fari,5,Mon May 11 13:23:33 2015 UTC,"I actually want it wherever there is a lot of spectators.  For most of the stage you see one or two people here or there, but at some hairpins and in the town sections there are people.  Montie is a party and when you blast through the town sections it should light up with flashes, air horns, and cheering.  From what I have seen it looks like the background of NBA JAM! when you go for a big dunk."
dirtgame,35itm0,tcpip4lyfe,3,Mon May 11 13:33:11 2015 UTC,"I agree it would add a lot to athmosphere! I think whether it gets annoying or interferes with visibility of the track aso, depends on the technical implementation. Meaning:  Is a camera flash in the game just a bright spot ""where the camera is"", or will the flash use the lighting engine brightening the area the camera is aimed at.  The second one would look cool, but might as I said above interfere with your driving.   But now that I think of it: If its done in reality it should happen in the game. Its a simulation after all :D"

dirtgame,35j0pg,LudwigVan666,1 point,Mon May 11 12:02:11 2015 UTC,"That's why I prefaced with ""I'm a goddamn sim freak and played everything"". Your experience is normal, especially so if you haven't played RBR, even if you have played other sims. The only way I'm pushing 100% is if I have memorized the stage or the particular corner I'm about to tackle, or if it's easily readable, but I used to know several RBR maniacs that could do new stages blind SUPER fast. Like top 10 in a league stage fast.  The Mini for me felt like a very fun toy to throw around carelessly. The only stage with it where I felt very real danger was that Greece one where there's a very steep and long downhill with several fast corners, which ends in a tight right-3 or something like that. At the time I had regular pacenote calling, so I was already like 20m from that corner when the codriver called it.

I guess it's realistic, when you see one of those nowadays it sways like a boat in a storm while drifting around corners. But it's frustrating when you need to go fast.

Made the suspension a bit stiffer and shortened the gears a bit (every car I've driven, except perhaps the Delta S4, can really use around 10 notches shorter gearing), it was a joy to drive. It was the only championship where I won all events!  EDIT: Also, my 2nd place with the 70's and 1st in the 80's were pure luck, cars in front of me breaking down and stuff, I should've ended 3rd in both probably.

dirtgame,35kwex,MahNilla,2,Mon May 11 10:24:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I loved the Escort. Moved from there to then M3 which is too much fun.  RWD cars are a totally different beast than AWD and FWD in this game.
dirtgame,35kwex,Thuraash,1 point,Mon May 11 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"The Abarth is definitely less of a handful than the Escort, but once you get used to the escort's agility, it's hard to play with the more stable but also kind of cumbersome Abart.  As you get more familiar with the Escort, you'll learn to work the throttle to get exactly the amount of oversteer you want. It's twitchy as hell at first, yes, but that's because most of us are really lead-footed. Work that throttle, and the car is incredibly agile.  I don't think it's got the Stratos' agility, but you'd be comparing an FR to an MR in that case."
dirtgame,35kwex,Namtlade,3,Tue May 12 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"I found the escort impossible to drive at first, after coming from the Mini. After a couple of races I found that I had to drive a lot more carefully, being quite careful with the throttle to avoid fishtailing.  It took a few hours to be able to handle it well. It is extremely satisfying when you do drive it well. Drifting around the corners feels fantastic when done right. It's still easy to screw it up though, and the entire game punishes failure harshly so I'll be sitting there swearing at the screen.   Yes, it can have a lot of oversteer, especially at low speeds. And it can be very slow to accelerate out of corners. I recommend being a bit easier on the throttle for both of these.  The best tip I have for this car is to break heavily while turning into the corners. I find that it's the best way to getting it to drift nicely.  I finally made enough money to get my next car, and did a quick custom race in the BMW (btw you can freely try any car in custom races). I went straight from feeling comfortable in the escort, to being shit scared again - the car feels so damn fast in comparison, and I went flying off the road many times. I think I'll have to go back to driving like a nun again until I get a bit better.  TL;DR: This game is difficult, take some time to learn the car!"

dirtgame,35kwex,recigar,3,Tue May 12 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"You can bail, you retire from in a race, quit the game, and when you restart the championship you select to not resume. I did this twice because I won enough money to buy the escort but didn't want to do like 8 more stages to play it!  At first I was disappointed like you. It took a while to work out how to race it, it can oversteer bad at times, I've reduced my gear ratio and loosened up the diff, it's mostly ok now except with tons of ice. I guess you can't just plow full throttle with that car through corners."
dirtgame,35kwex,recigar,2,Mon May 11 09:52:23 2015 UTC,I don't even plow full throttle...I've tried every set up...thing just fishtails everywhere.  I swear even if I do manage to not crash the thing every fourth corner it would be a struggle to actually have fun playing.  I'll try you're method now.  God help me.

dirtgame,35kwex,Case_f,1 point,Tue May 12 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"I love the Mk2. Find it a lot easier to flick around hairpins - that's not to say I get it right every time, ofc. But I do enjoy driving - although it needs adjusting from it's base tuning to make it driveable. I'm still tweaking."
dirtgame,35infw,Godvater,15,Sun May 10 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"We like this game. A lot. And the realism feeling we get is what makes us feel special playing this game. I guess we all agree on that.  I have watched a lot of videos from you guys. Some of you drive like pros , a lot better than me. But one thing i noticed is that even good players  are using HUD. I think it kills the fun because when the HUD is on you dont need to listen to your co-pilot, your engine and also you don't need to follow your gears.    I beg to differ. I run with the HUD on and I still listen to the codriver. In real rally, you can ask for hold and repeats. This is something you cannot do in the game. I'm no pro rally driver, and I have brain fart moments where I need a repeat. I make a quick glance on screen and see the call. It also helps if I didn't understand the call, something the intercom and car audio is bad at.  As for gears, with H pattern shifting, by the location of the shifter is how you follow your gears. If your car has a sequential transmission, they have a large numerical counter on the dash to tell you the gear you're in.  Some people don't have H pattern shifters, so a gear indicator helps.   I am a complete newbie and if i can drive without HUD i think you guys should can too. It can take a while to get used to but in the end you will never go back. Later on you will feel the way I am feeling when u see people playing with HUD on.    If they can let us customize notes and run recce, I'm all for closing the HUD off. I don't think the point is that you cannot drive with it on, but the information it has (even as an advanced driver) really helps out for repeats/holds/clarifications."
dirtgame,35infw,HerpDerpenberg,4,Sun May 10 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"I really like that you can drive without the visual indicators and HUD, I turned them off right away. It just feels much more rewarding when you succeed without them, despite the fact that I sometimes crash or make a bad turn because I got distracted. It forces you to concentrate harder, which is great. It also feels more immersive since you have to rely on audible notes instead of visual indicators, just like in real life."
dirtgame,35infw,SimonCharles,3,Mon May 11 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"I turned mine off for the achievement, and found I really liked it. Don't feel like I'm missing anything, plus it means I only know my timings at the end."
dirtgame,35infw,Mark_McQ,3,Sun May 10 20:08:18 2015 UTC,Hear hear! Was thinking the same thing.
dirtgame,35infw,IAmtheHullabaloo,3,Sun May 10 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"I started driving without the hud since my first play. It's kind of redundant because, the rev limiter is already visible on the dashboard of the car cockpit, and I don't know about you guys but having some time playing other sims, I don't need to watch the speedometer. I also think the point is to get the feel of the speed for the turn you are about to take from what you are seeing. Adjusting the FOV to the screen size also helps.  It calls to my attention that you say you don't need to listen to your co-pilot with the HUD on. Does the visual indications disappear to you, if you turn off the HUD? Because as I say I've disabled the hud, but I still see the indications."
dirtgame,35infw,adyrhan,1 point,Sun May 10 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Visual indicators may be a separate option, but they can be turned off."
dirtgame,35infw,HerpJersey,6,Sun May 10 22:01:58 2015 UTC,I'll play the game the way I find to be the most fun. I find it more enjoyable with the HuD on.
dirtgame,35infw,adyrhan,2,Sun May 10 22:12:40 2015 UTC,I sort of wish my co-driver would say slow more often.  There are times when I just assume caution means watch out for something rather than take this corner slower.  Edit:  I should add that I do play HUDless and in driver's view.
dirtgame,35infw,adyrhan,3,Sun May 10 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think there are some problems with pace notes. Even more in other languages than English."
dirtgame,35infw,CroSSGunS,1 point,Sun May 10 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"I can imagine.  Having watched a lot of rally videos, pace note reading in other languages sounds so hectic and...  colourful in comparison. :D"
dirtgame,35infw,CroSSGunS,1 point,Sun May 10 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah they have to be hectic because some sentences, for instance in Spanish, they are always a little bit longer than English. I've found some 2 numbered turns and hairpins where the co-driver would say something like ""Derecha cinco(5) para horquilla izquierda cincuenta(50)"" and right when the co-driver ends saying that, I'll be exiting the ""horquilla izquierda"" (left hairpin) and being like ""Okay, thank you, appreciated..."". I can imagine of other languages, like I think German has some quite long words, when the co-driver would end for that same set of turns."
dirtgame,35infw,recigar,1 point,Sun May 10 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"It'd be interesting if they could come up with a ""universal rally language"" that was fast to speak and precise.   Sort of something that everyone could speak and understand that could convey directions very fast."
dirtgame,35infw,najtrows,1 point,Sun May 10 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"The actual ""Pace Notes"" that real pros use is pretty damn close to this. We get route notes, so they just describe the road in as accurate a way possible.  right 8 minus plus middle double up tightens"
dirtgame,35infw,Bdubber,1 point,Mon May 11 01:41:03 2015 UTC,Yeah but the co drivers also know when to properly deliver the notes on time.

The hairpins in this car are doable by keeping the revs up while braking into 2nd gear, then using the handbrake to get around the corner. Because you'll have kept the revs up, it will shoot out of the corner!   Wish I could've raced today :("

dirtgame,35hd78,Crushker,7,Sun May 10 11:15:33 2015 UTC,I've studied quite a few if these incidents and it appears that if the co-driver is talking when the trigger for a new call goes off he will continue saying his piece and the next call doesn't get spoken. This could be solved by placing calls in a FIFO buffer and having them called out regardless of the point in time they occur.  Then if the buffer gets too long they should switch over to a more abrupt call set in which the co-driver doesn't take so long to say them.  It's actually a very simple solution to what's happening.
dirtgame,35hd78,khando,3,Sun May 10 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"I've been having a few issues like this too.  Either he calls out after I have hit the turn and gone flying, or he doesn't ever make the call at all.  I may try messing with the timing of the calls, I haven't changed those settings yet."
dirtgame,35hd78,SirCrest_YT,4,Sun May 10 13:19:37 2015 UTC,I'm on normal and sometimes it's late and sometimes it feels like it's 5 turns ahead.
dirtgame,35hd78,InTheCatBoxAgain,2,Sun May 10 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"I tried using the ""later"" setting and usually it was okay, but sometimes he called it as I was in the turn or passed it."
