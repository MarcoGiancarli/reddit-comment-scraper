themartian,3e4e9v,xJ_Dx,4,Tue Jul 21 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"I guess there would be like five glorious years of nothing really happening while they review all the stuff and eventually start to continue the missions from scrath.    One part is the Mars supplies that need to be sent there, preferably with more redundancy and better equipments. Two MAV's maybe? Better hab materials? Better spacesuits? (Andy already told replaceable CO2 filters won't be needed in reality) Potato farm already included? Or put the missions into one location so they are very close to each other?    The Hermes, on the other hand, well, that's fucked up. I don't think current safety regulations would ever allow anybody onboard the ISS in case of some explosions onboard. Maybe disassembling it and using the other half modules would work, but structurally I guess some if not most of the ship would be considered not human rated anymore."
themartian,3e4e9v,TheBlacktom,2,Tue Jul 21 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"Hermes is like, the most expensive thing built in the history of anything IIRC. It would be nigh-irreplaceable. MAYBE they'd be able to repair some of it with the funds NASA has presumeably generated by various corporations/companies/the president himself during the hype over Mark Watney's rescue, but even then It's probably a no, because most of those funds have probably already went towards the rescue attempts. Maybe after Mark was rescued NASA got more funds to continue Ares missions? This book left me with so many questions haha."
themartian,3e4e9v,TheBlacktom,2,Tue Jul 21 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"Well, the rescue attempts doesn't cost really much, the first launch vehicle was already there, they just needed the payload, which is mainly food, so no big deal. The second chinese one was eventually for free, at least not paid in money. The Ares missions probably were already funded, so with some additional investment to put some more stuff on Mars it could be continued. Yeah, the problem would be Hermes, I really don't know if it would be acceptable to try to repair it. Thinking about it they were quite insane to blow that stuff up."
themartian,3e4e9v,SupermAndrew1,3,Tue Jul 21 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"The bomb was an insane idea. Goes to show how far people take things in an attempt to save a life, but that's the whole theme of the book. I feel like the Chinese would be super pissed off if the Ares program didn't continue. They were promised a chinese astronaut on Mars, and they ditched the Taiyan Sheng in the process, and NASA destroyed it's booster by rushing the construction of their on probe, which failed. Thats a ton of losses for the Chinese space program, and now they can't even get what they were promised."

themartian,3e4e9v,MajorParadox,3,Wed Jul 22 04:10:01 2015 UTC,"The notion of the possible Ares 6 was also totally thrown out the window by the utter destruction of the hab and the rovers. I think in real world terms, the world would rejoice when Mark Watney was rescued, and then during the long return home politicians and media blowhards would start questioning everything about both the Ares mission and the rescue.   First: The Ares crew directly disobeyed orders while in deep space on a mission. I know that in the book this Mitch played up revealing this as mutually assured destruction, but I have to imagine that someone would leak the information at some point. Second, the rescue not only cost untold billions of dollars, but caused untold millions (at least) in damage to Hermes. So there would be wide questioning about the value of continuing the missions on the grounds of fiscal responsibility.   That being said, part of the deal with NASA getting the Chinese booster was that the Chinese would get a seat on an Ares mission. There was a brief mention of the exchange being kept between the space agencies, but that seems highly implausible (ITAR and politics and stuff.) So I'm guessing the federal government made some sort of commitment somewhere along the line, and they'd have to make a separate fairly serious concession to avoid meeting that commitment. Hard to say."
themartian,3e4e9v,NeilJHopwood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"I was also thinking about how some people would think negatively about Mark's rescue. Maybe in a worst-case scenario, NASA would cover up Mark's survival in order to prevent the billion-dollar mission to save him, but keeping real to the major theme of the book, that would probably never happen."
themartian,3e4e9v,knots_,3,Tue Jul 21 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"NASA would probably end up with more funding because of the amount of interest Mark helped gain.  They could plan to bring back all his samples on the next mission, which would be huge considering how far he traveled and how long he was there."
themartian,3e4e9v,NeilJHopwood,3,Tue Jul 21 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"Bringing back the samples Mark gathered would definetly be an important part of a future Ares mission. I don't think it was ever mentioned in the book exactly how much he took with him on his rover mission to Schiaperreli, so maybe Ares 4 will be completely dedicated to bringing back what Mark left. NASA would need to make advanced rovers to make the trip to the Ares 3 Hab easier, in order to get samples Mark left at the Hab."
themartian,3e4e9v,sto-ifics42,2,Wed Jul 22 00:05:28 2015 UTC,"In the Audiobook the end actually takes place in Houston when Mark is going to meet the flight engineer for the next Ares Mission.  They actually talk about how after every mission Hermes gets a retrofit, so it would have probably just gotten a much longer refit. A ship that large would have to have been built in orbit anyway, so I can't imagine the damage wouldn't have been fixable.  As for Ares IV send a new MAV, yea its going to delay the mission, but the ARES III crew taking Hermes on its extended trip would have delayed the mission anyway."

themartian,3e3b85,TheBlacktom,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"that certainly seems to be the accepted narrative:   Word of the book spread, and readers started asking for an e-reader copy. So Weir made all the individual chapters available in one file. Some had trouble downloading it though, so Weir put it on Amazon via Kindle Direct Publishing.  That's when the floodgates opened. More people downloaded the 99-cent Amazon version than had ever downloaded the free version, Weir said, and readers started leaving positive reviews on Amazon. In just a few months it skyrocketed to the top of Amazon's best-selling science fiction list.   I tend to agree, psychologically people are much more likely to risk 99¢ on an unknown than $5.99 (the current Kindle price)."

themartian,3e3b85,gruisinger,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe. It seems to me getting it widely distributed on an easy-to-use platform helped the most. When it was free, most people who wanted to read the book either didn't know it existed, or could not be bothered to figure out how to download it and get it on their reading device of choice. It seems to me many people are willing to spend 99¢ to have a book delivered directly to their kindle with no more effort than clicking the buy button. 99¢ is the lowest price he could use, so who knows what would have happened if it had been even less."

The book had a much more light feel to it, that just made me happy and enjoy it all the way through the book.  I think (and hope, more than that), that it's just the trailer that did that, because a trailer's purpose is to sell tickets. You can't pass on the feeling the book did in just 1:30 minutes, the best you can do in that timespan is drama and action the shit out of it.  That's my 2 cents.."
themartian,3dpevn,jojotoughasnails,2,Sat Jul 18 07:53:11 2015 UTC,Obvs.  Hype it up and get butts in the seats.  They wouldn't sell as many tickets if they whole trailer was a disco montage and Watney pooping in a bag for his potato farm.

I'm a big Ridley Scott fan, but so far I'm not impressed, especially the choice for main actor. After having MD in Interstellar, was that really necessary? The book thrives on his sarcastic, even mildly fatalistic humor - I can't see MD pulling that off."

I could have thought of a bunch of different actors who could play Mark Watney, but Matt Damon's got some versatility. Just look at the difference between his characters in The Departed and The Talented Mr. Ripley. I think he'll be able to pull it off.  Ridley Scott is a kick ass director, and I have a lot of faith in him. I think he's going to do a good job with the book. As for the marketing: it makes sense. The marketing for Apollo 13 didn't include the filter scene, it was all ""Houston we have a problem"" and pensive shots of mission control. It's just to reel people in."

themartian,3dn3wy,Isarian,3,Fri Jul 17 16:48:55 2015 UTC,Andy Weir has said that the vast majority of the Ares mission plans are taken straight from Mars Direct. Hermes is the main difference.
themartian,3dn3wy,sto-ifics42,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:00 2015 UTC,Does Hermes actually make sense? Is it cheaper to do the propulsion between Earth and Mars with an Ion drive after N missions? If so for what N?
themartian,3dn3wy,DeepDuh,2,Sat Jul 18 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know the cost difference involved, but Weir's variant does make sense.   The original Mars Direct involved sending a very large MAV and very large Hab to Mars with each mission. The Hab doubled as the Earth-Mars spacecraft, and the MAV doubled as the Mars-Earth spacecraft. Both have to carry lots of supplies and extensive life support for a multi-year mission.  In The Martian, Hermes takes care of all Earth/Mars transit and is basically a one-time cost. We still need to send a MAV and Hab with each mission, but they're much smaller. The MAV only has to get them from surface to orbit, and the Hab just has to keep them alive for a month or so instead of several years. Hermes's ion drive also cuts total mission length down to just over a year, and greatly increases mission flexibility because it's not bound by Hohmann transfer windows.   All in all a much better deal."

If the public did not know he was alive, they probably would not rescue him. Watney's rescue was a monumentally expensive effort that required multiple rockets and cancelled missions to accomplish. I think that if nobody knew he was still alive, NASA would ask him to take a lethal dose of morphine rather than jeopardize their manned spaceflight program for years to come. Callous? Yes. Forward thinking? Also yes.  If the public knows about Mark's message, then it's a no-brainer. Any politician worth his/her salt would be clamoring for his return as a way to increase their standing in the public eye. At that point, cost doesn't matter; NASA would do everything they could to rescue him, because everyone would be demanding it. However, as stated earlier, this would potentially gut many programs and possibly lead to the end of America's manned spaceflight program for a long time, due to the cost of the rescue."

Watney himself spoke of how much NASA would want to know after he spent so much time there. Not to mention it's huge publicity for NASA/America.  Second, if Watneys crew found out they wouldn't have let NASA leave them. As soon as they found out in the book they were ready to go back, even if it meant suicide. If the crew knew, NASA would have no choice....unless they just let them all die and make up some mission failure story to tell the public."
themartian,3dj686,SilentDis,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:37 2015 UTC,"unless they just let them all die and make up some mission failure story to tell the public.   As absolutely horrible this movie is... a combination of this, and the moon hoax concept were combined in 1977.  Capricorn One.  This movie was... laughably bad, in many ways.  Having said that, the concept, and tech shown, was barely available in 1977.  The 'special effects' were literally cutting edge; so much so they basically had to 'show the work'.  They had to show what they were doing every step because it was so janky.  Without ruining absolutely everything, the basic story is this:  It is known to a small elite a manned Mars mission won't work.  It's simply not feasible.  But, the political will is there, and to capitalize on it, for NASA's and the White House administration's image, they go ahead with it anyway.  All but an exceptional few at the top know it won't work.  On the pad, minutes before launch, the astronauts are ordered out, at gunpoint, and quickly whisked away to a facility in the middle of the desert.  There, they're finally told what's going on.  Their training stints were all recorded and are being played back, right now, to fool everyone.  Including most of mission control.  They are given one option; fake it, on a sound stage.  So, they do.  They sit around, comfortable, safe at least, watching the press coverage, etc.  Then, the unmanned probe that was sent... blows up.  By today's standards; this movie is bottom-barrel budget.  It starred OJ Simpson, too, and it appears that's where a lot of the budget went.  Still, the 'what if' it raises is exceptionally worth your time.  Much like China Syndrome, Westworld, Soylent Green, Logan's Run; not great movies on their own, especially considering Star Wars, Alien, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind were also released around the same time.  I honestly enjoy many of these old, 'bad' sci-fi movies.  The production quality is laughable, the story often ends up on bizarre tangents that don't mesh thematically with the first and second acts.  You end up scratching your head and going ""how the hell did this become an action movie?"" most of the time.  What I like about them is that they asked the question; and at least took it seriously for a good portion of the screen time.  Probably why I actually appreciated Bicentennial Man more than most; it took the original work, and the concept given exceptionally seriously from start to finish."

It was good, don't get me wrong; but it felt like he was mashing up The Last Starfighter with a bunch of Star Trek Next Generation episodes.

I kinda 'called it' as it went into it's second act; and it was just a formulaic step-by-step till the end for me.  Not at all Cline's fault, though.  I'm a sci-fi kid, and a sci-fi adult; I love the philosophy, the what-if, the what's next the genere brings.  Even 'bad' sci-fi gives that to me.  I'm not that crazy person who'd ask Shatner what Kirk's motivations where in episode 37 or whatever; I'm the guy who'd shake his hand, and thank him for portraying something that made me think about my life and the future.  It's worth a read, or worth a listen if you're into the audiobook thing.

It's a smooth, wonderful read from beginning to end.  There's a 'coda' at the end of the original, though, that was 'off' from the original narrative, but it gave closure.

themartian,3d66gp,panthyren,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:48:08 2015 UTC,My audio book is 32 hours. It doesn't really speed up. The entire first 2/3 is the same pace. The last 1/3 is 5000 years in the future and has a different narrator.   It's slow but interesting. I found my self wanting to keep going back to it and it has my two hour commute flying by.

There's no way they can make it back to Earth considering what a big deal it was that they didn't go back in the book. She's definitely an important character in the book, so I do hope they show that in the movie.  *The rescue is obviously featured for us who have read the book. However, I could see those who haven't not knowing that's actually the rescue taking place. There's some ambiguity there.  *There's a lot of speculation in this sub about Watney having a family. Several Redditors have pointed out differences in the scenes. Most seem to believe (or hope) that it actually shows Martinez's family.  Yea, Hermes does look huge. I guess that's kind minor though in reference to everything else. There are so many important conversations that happen between everyone there. I guess it's nicer to see them sitting around rather than cramped up dispersed throughout some hallway.  I'm really looking forward to Jeff Daniels and Donald Glover. And yea, Venkat is supposed to be Indian. I guess they directors just thought they'd throw in a foreigner and call it a day? Kristen Wiig will be funny and perfect as the bitchy/neurotic Annie."

It was a tiny window into the lives of these amazing people. Rather than exposition heavy flashbacks, we get a tantalizing hint at their lives. With Lewis it was rather disco/ABBA heavy, of course, but you get my drift!  Jeff Daniels will be great as Teddy Sanders (although described as ""chickenshit"", I sypmathise with te tough choice he had). I look forward to the conflict this archetypal bureaucrat will bring."

Mad Max was way too explodey (is that a word?) and flashy for my liking. Honestly, I thought it was better than Jurassic World. Jurassic World felt so bland and cliche that it made me want to rewatch Jurassic Park. Now that was a great movie!  When an amazing book comes along and gets turned into a movie, I nearly die from excitement. It's pretty awesome when something new is created, instead of just a remake or sequel. The only reason I'd go see Iron Man, Avengers, Star Trek, or whatever franchise they are on now, is to hang out with friends. I think quite a bit of my disappointment stems from lack of good, original ideas.   What's funny though, is that I saw the trailer for The Martian during the previews for Jurassic World. It totally caught me off guard.   A friend had been telling me over and over that I should read the book, but this really decided it for me. I ended up binge reading the book in the span of a day or so and just loved it; it's been the best book I've read all year by far. When opening night comes, I'll definitely be there!"

themartian,3cjscm,dangerz,6,Wed Jul 8 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"The HAB is a lot bigger than I'd pictured it to be.  Same for the rovers.  In the books, he mentions how cramped the rovers are a couple times and how he had a hard time putting the batteries in there.  The rovers in the movie seem massive."

themartian,3cjscm,SamsquamtchHunter,5,Wed Jul 8 20:22:25 2015 UTC,The HAB is actually about the size I imagined it. I imagined it pretty big because it was meant to house 6 people and have room for them to move around and do science.

themartian,3cjscm,zlsa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"In the book he was the hab is 92 square metres, which would make the diameter about 10 metres. I would say it looks about that size in the trailer."
themartian,3cjscm,kingphysics,3,Mon Jul 13 01:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, wouldn't be surprised if they change it from him being impaled to him just being wiped out by the dish and then a little bit stabbing him. Rather than being impaled and blood gushing everywhere before forming a seal in the suit. He tinkers with his helmet when the hab blows and smashes his visor. He makes a temporary fix then switches the helmet once he forages back into the hab. In the book Nasa recognises he's alive then waits for him to contact them, which he does. Then they don't tell the Hermes crew for a while, in the trailer this has been cut right down to Nasa receiving transmission, then Hermes receiving the message addressed to the whole crew. In the book Nasa does send the message and address it to the whole crew so that part in the trailer is accurate, even if the time Nasa waits to tell them has been rapidly reduced in the film. Yeah that just looks cooler for the film version. That shot with the outer ship spinning while the resupply comes in is awesome. Yeah that's just Martinez's family I'd bet. Highly doubt they'd stuff a family in for Watney when it's not needed which would bring his character so far away from the book. The thing he's probably looking at on screen is a message from Nasa when he first makes contact, since he does get a bit emotional at that bit of the book. Again, just looks cooler. They've made the rover much bigger for the film so they've probably done just the same with the airlocks."
themartian,3cjscm,zlsa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"I can't stand the fact that they made everything so much bigger in the movie. Come on guys, it's six people, they don't need a building-sized (and building-weight) spaceship. Same goes for the rover (seriously, they made that building-sized too?) and the airlock (which looks like the size of a large SUV)."

themartian,3cjscm,darwonka,2,Fri Jul 10 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"I have seen a lot of people complain about how big the rover is, but i disagree. we only have the one picture which isnt exactly a good angle to get scale, and when you consider what its made for its really not that big. its made to fit 3 people in a pressurized space for traversing martian terrain. compare it to the real life NASA LER (lunar electric rover) developed in the early 2000s for lunar missions that never happened:   http://swamplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ler-nasa-arizona.jpg  http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/374178main_LER1024x768.jpg  now consider the martian rover was developed decades after that, for a much harsher environment, and for a larger number of people. (not to mention its the 3rd mars mission)  from looking at the one picture we have, it looks slightly smaller then twice the size of the lunar rover. other then the tires which are much larger to accommodate the much harsher terrain. the body of the rover itself doesn't seem to be that big. in fact if you look closely it seems it has a similar design to the lunar rover, where the back set of tires is farther back then where the actual body ends.   here is how i imagine how big it would be:  http://i.imgur.com/JnUeyQ6.jpg  as for the other things, the airlock doesnt seem to be that big to me, and hermes while yeah is bigger then it probably should be, dont forget that a lot of it is probably the engine. i would say everything from the spinny part to the front is actually habitable space, and the majority of that is probably storage.   http://i.imgur.com/4lvVOt9.png"

themartian,3bygrv,newcantonrunner5,9,Fri Jul 3 11:28:25 2015 UTC,"Chapter 2  Log entry: vacation day 14 survival mission day 12  Approaching Hermes II at a snail pace.  I'm almost out of RCS monopropellant, and I'd prefer the event to be a ""docking"" rather than a ""crashing"".  Once I'm on the ship I'll be able to contact Ares VI.  Looking forward to that conversation.  I've been thinking about how to get down to the surface of Mars from Hermes II.  It doesn't have an MDV, that was used by the Ares VI crew.  This is a pretty big problem.  Hermes II has a heat shield, but it's only made for aerobraking for course adjustments, not reentry.  There are no parachutes or landing thrusters.  My only real option would be considered suicide in any other scenario.  I have to remove the heat shield from Hermes II, crouch behind it in my EVA suit, and enter the Martian atmosphere.  Since I'd be so light, the heat shield would be more than sufficient for reentry.  That will get me from about 6 km/s to 1 km/s.  Next, I can jump off the heat shield and use a parachute I made using various fabrics I find on Hermes II.  That should get me down to 100 m/s, or maybe 75 m/s if I can make a big enough parachute.  Here's where it starts getting dangerous.  I could have the Ares VI crew set up a giant net to catch me.  I'd have to be extremely accurate in my descent profile to hit it.  But I don't see any other options at this point.  Maybe they will have some better ideas.  Admittedly, almost any other idea would be better.    [07:32] Watney: Greetings Martians!  As you're probably aware by now, Earth had a little accident.  I was able to launch from the moon and commandeer Hermes II, which is where I am now.  The food farm here is functioning, as are the water reclaimer, oxygenator, atmospheric regulator, and nuclear power generator.  I should be able to survive here for a long time, hopefully long enough to reach you.  What's your status?  [08:15] Ares VI: Mark!  You're alive!  We are all thrilled to know there was at least one other survivor.  This is commander Damian Patterson.  Our status is good - we are all alive and well.  We even have our own potato farm growing now thanks to you.  We also have some corn, wheat, and a couple other vegetables.  I wish we had known Earth would blow up, we would have taken a lot more seeds.  It looks like Hermes II is a bit off course because of the gravitational change of Earth.  Will you be able to correct it?  [09:04] Watney: Yes, I think so.  The ion engines appear to be functional, and I have plenty of argon.  It should only take a few weeks to get back on course.  I'm a bit worried about trying to land on Mars.  I was thinking I could ride the heat shield like a knee board for the upper atmosphere, rig up some kind of parachute for the lower atmosphere, then land on a net you guys build.  It sounds pretty dangerous but at least it would be fun.  [09:42] Ares VI: Jesus Mark, I knew you were adventurous, but if you wanted to kill yourself there are much easier ways.  Why would you not use the Hermes I MDV?  [10:16] Watney: HERMES I STILL HAS AN MDV?!?!  Damian, I love you.  I thought that MDV was used by Ares V?  [11:03] Ares VI: The Ares V crew used AN MDV, but another one was built.  It wasn't known whether or not Hermes II would be complete before our mission was scheduled to depart.  Lucky for you, it was.    [11:41] Watney: I guess that's what I get for retiring from NASA and ignoring all the latest news.  Are you able to run diagnostics on the MDV remotely?  [12:21] Ares VI: Yes, and initial results show that it is still functional.  We'll run more thorough diagnostics and let you know the status, but if anything's wrong I'm sure you'll be able to fix it when you get there.  Hermes I is currently in low Martian orbit, but I'll have our pilot figure out a course so that it can intercept with you when you get here.  Or at least as close as possible.  [13:00] Watney: Thank you so much commander.  Looking forward to meeting the rest of humanity in about 8 months.  By the way, are you guys starting to, uh... rebuild the human race?  [13:59] Ares VI: ;)  Log entry: 2nd day on Hermes II  My skills as a space pirate have proven useful.  I successfully commandeered Hermes II, the single most expensive thing ever built.  Hermes II is awesome.  It's got significantly more space than Hermes I, and in addition to that, I'm the only one on board.  Before I started rotating it for gravity, I was able to fly around naked.  If you haven't tried that, I highly recommend it.  I've corrected my course to fly by Mars and skim the upper atmosphere.  This will allow me to slow down enough to get in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars and eventually dock with Hermes I.    When I got back to Earth a bit over 10 years ago, there were a few things I swore to myself I would never do: never eat potatoes, never watch 70's shows, never listen to disco.  But something weird happened.  Something that, to this day, I'm ashamed to admit.  Maybe it's post traumatic stress disorder.  Maybe it's a very weird version of stockholm syndrome.  Maybe it's some kind of conditioned response.  But I started liking disco.  Not all the time.  Certainly not exclusively.  But every once in a while, I will get a craving for it that I can't really explain.  I now have 8 months to kill, and guess what?  Plenty of disco to go along with it.    [03:14] Ares VI:  Mark, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this.  We ran a more complete diagnostic on the MDV, and it looks like the engine used for deorbiting is completely corroded.  We think there must have been a hydrazine leak near it.  It's unlikely you'd be able to repair it.  The landing thrusters are still operational, but unfortunately they  use a different type of fuel from the deorbiting engine.  If you use them to deorbit you won't have enough fuel to soft-land.   We're trying to come up with a way to adjust the orbit of Hermes I (after you dock of course) that would make a deorbit burn unnecessary.  But this would cause Hermes I to burn up in the atmosphere after you left it, and all that debris would be landing right near our base.  Not really ideal.  Maybe we can have you land a few hundred km away, and we'll have a rover in that area waiting to pick you up.  Our rovers currently aren't designed to go that far, but maybe you could help us design some modifications.  [03:44] Watney: Why don't I just use the lunar module to deorbit?  [04:17] Ares VI: That works too.  Log entry: 22nd day on Hermes II  The crops were not in great shape when I got here.  It was plenty of food for me, but for feeding a crew of 6 it would have been tight.  It felt great to get back to botany for once.  The plants are really thriving now.  Sorry robots, you still can't compete with good old flesh and blood.  It's doubtful anyone but me will ever be on this ship again, but you never know when a spaceship stocked with years of food might come in handy.  Log entry: 60th day on Hermes II  Once I dock with Hermes I, there will be a lot of work to be done.  I'll have to double check all the systems of the entire ship.  There haven't been any passengers on it since the Ares V crew got back to Earth.  It was piloted remotely to get back to Mars.  That way, in case of emergency, the Ares VI crew could abort at any time and take Hermes I back to Earth.  Well, you could say this is an emergency, but they won't be going back to Earth.  After verifying Hermes I is fully functional, I'll then have to double check the MDV.  The corrosion that they described sounded pretty nasty, I'll have to see exactly which systems it affected.  Once that is complete, I'll have to figure out a way to connect the LM to the MDV for the deorbit burn.  This will probably be tricky.  I'm currently studying all the parts and manuals of the LM so that when the time comes I'll know what to do.  Now that I have more time to myself to think, the gravity of what actually happened is starting to hit me.  I'm not worried about food, water, air, power, or debris, so my thoughts drift to my family, friends, coworkers, and crew mates.  The experts at NASA who worked so hard to keep me alive.  The actors and singers and artists who worked to entertain all of humanity.  The entrepreneurs and geniuses and inventors who worked to push us forward.  Without them, the other 6 humans and I would have still been on Earth when it was destroyed.  And humanity would have been destroyed along with it.  Log entry: 109th day on Hermes II  Today would have been the start of E3 2049.  I wonder if they would have announced Half-Life 3.  Log entry: 212th day on Hermes II  Today is aerobraking day.  For the last week, I've been checking my trajectory every few hours.  The computers handle everything of course, but it makes me feel better to know the computers are doing the right thing.  The margin of error is extremely tight.  If I dip to low in the atmosphere, I will lose too much speed and won't be able to climb back out.  If I stay too high, I'll stay in an escape trajectory and it will take me years to get back to Mars.  The ship can't be rotating when aerobraking, so I'm back to weightlessness.  It's nice to be able to communicate with the Ares VI crew in real time.  I've gotten to know them pretty well.  Unsurprisingly, they are all amazing people.  They were chosen for both their talents and their personalities.  This not only makes them great astronauts, but also a great way to start the next phase of humanity.  Except for Bob.  Fuck that guy."
themartian,3bygrv,nowenknows,6,Fri Jul 3 04:52:53 2015 UTC,"Chapter 3  Log entry: 212th day on Hermes II (part 2)  The aerobraking went okay.  I'm successfully in orbit around Mars, but my orbit is not that close to Hermes 1's orbit.  It will take over a month to rendezvous.  But that's OK, I still have plenty of supplies.  Log entry: 222nd day on Hermes II  The crew and I have been discussing new methods of timekeeping on Mars.  It's nice of them to include me in the conversation - they didn't really have to, I'd go along with whatever they decided.  Obviously it doesn't make sense to keep using times based on the parameters of Earth at this point.  There are 668.5991 sols per martian year (or, I guess we can just say days per year now).  668 doesn't have many nice factors.  But 665 does, including 35.  We all agreed 35 was a good number for days in a month since it's a multiple of 7.  With exactly 5 weeks per month, each day of the month will always fall on the same day of the week.  Then we have 19 months per year.  We weren't creative enough to name them all, so they're simply numbered 1 through 19 (the computer scientist of the group voted for 0-18 but we shot that down pretty quick).  At the end of the year, we add either 3 or 4 bonus days (which would obviously all be holidays) to stay in sync.  We still have an ongoing debate about whether the first of the month should be a Sunday or Monday.  Also, someone pointed out that all the days of the week are named after objects in the sky.  But since Mars was no longer technically in the sky, perhaps Tuesday should be renamed.  But we voted 5 - 2 against renaming Tuesday to Uranusday.  Log entry: 239th day on Hermes II  I can see Hermes I!  My old ship!  And I do mean old, it was constructed over 25 years ago.    Since both ships are huge and only have low-thrust ion engines, I'm approaching extremely slowly.  Hermes I in particular seems to have lower than normal amounts of thrust.  I can't even tell that we're approaching each other with the naked eye.  It will be at least a few more hours before I'm close enough to do an EVA.  Since both ships are thrusting away from each other to slow their relative velocity, I was a little worried about argon atoms hitting the ships at 40 km/s.  To avoid this, I offset the ships laterally.  This also has the benefit that if something goes wrong or an engine fails, the two ships will fly by each other harmlessly.  Log entry: 239th day on Hermes II (part 2)  Shit.  Shit shit shit.  I did an EVA to assess Hermes I.  The hydrazine corrosion was on more than just the MDV, it was also on Hermes I's nuclear reactor.  I couldn't even get close enough to properly assess the damage before the geiger counter in my suit started beeping.  I high-tailed it back to Hermes II.  You know that feeling when you drop something and your first instinct is ""please don't hit my balls..."" and then it hits your balls?  Yeah, this is kind of like that.  If any of the other major systems (water reclaimer, oxygenator, atmospheric regulator, etc) had been damaged, I could still dock with Hermes I and just have the systems from Hermes II support until I was able to fix it.  But with a breach in the nuclear reactor I can't even get close without being bathed in radiation.  Somehow the reactor is still working, at least partially, and supplying some power to the ship.  I can remotely have the MDV detach from Hermes I.  Then I'll have Hermes I accelerate away from me and my brand new MDV.  Unfortunately the only free docking port I have is too big for the MDV's docking port.  I could release the Lunar Module and use that docking port, but I need that ship for the deorbit burn.  I'll just have to tether the MDV to Hermes II and find a way to prevent the two from bouncing in to each other.  Log entry: 240th day on Hermes II  Well, I'm clear of any radiation dangers.  Hermes I is safely away and now climbing to a slightly higher orbit so I won't run into it again.  I duct taped the MDV to the side of Hermes II.  It should be perfectly stable there, as long as I don't try to rotate for gravity.  I hadn't planned on doing that anyway since I would have been docked with Hermes I.  Log entry: 241st day on Hermes II  I spent the day inspecting the MDV.  Other than the main engine, it's actually in pretty good shape.  Most importantly, the fuel tanks that would have fed the main engine are intact.  This is critical because I need this fuel for the LM.  Hermes II is stocked to the brim with supplies, including a temporary fuel tank and all the tools needed to make the fuel transfer happen.  It should also have everything I need to attach the LM to the MDV.  The connection doesn't need to be super strong, I will be doing the burn at the lowest possible thrust on the LM.  But duct tape won't cut it this time.  There's a sentence I was hoping I'd never have to write.  Log entry: 242nd day on Hermes II  The MDV is designed to enter the atmosphere from low martian orbit, which is about 3.5 km/s.  Since my orbit is quite elliptical, I'll be going over 4 km/s.  I've been talking with the crew's physicist, and she says it won't be a problem since I'll have much less mass on the ship than what it's designed for.  I decided to trust her, not only because she is now the leading physicist in the solar system, but also because I need an ample amount of time between the deorbit burn (which happens at apoapsis) and reentry.  With an elliptical orbit, I have a matter of hours to do an EVA, detatch the LM, get back in the MDV, and orient the ship for the final approach.  With a circular orbit, it would only be a matter of minutes.  I don't want to be racing against the clock when being late means a hot fiery death.  Or maybe I would smack into the planet before burning up - I haven't done that calculation yet.  The Ares VI site is pretty close to the equator, and my inclination is near 0, so my reentry window opens up every few days when the base is under periapsis.  I think I'm getting pretty close.  Log entry: 245th day on Hermes II  I finished attaching the LM to the MDV yesterday.  I wanted it connected strongly enough that it could support the thrust of the LM during the deorbit burn, but I also need to be able to detach it fairly quickly before reentry.  There are 4 trusses connecting the two, and to detach them I just unscrew a series of screws.  I practiced the procedure multiple times to make sure I could do it quickly.  It takes me less than 20 minutes now, so I'm pretty confident I'll have plenty of time before reentry.  I spent most of today doing the Hermes II shutdown procedure.  It will still be powered and somewhat operational, but most of the life support systems will be in a suspended mode.   I don't know how long I'll have to wait at the landing site for them to reach me, so I took a bit of water and food.  I also brought a few small things requested by the crew.  Within 8 hours, I'll be on the surface of Mars.  I don't know if I'll be alive or dead when that happens.  If I'm alive, I'll be the first person to visit the surface of Mars twice.  If I'm dead, I'll be the first person buried on Mars.  I win either way.  How's that for optimism?  Log entry: 245 days after boarding Hermes II  This is it.  I'm in the LM, detached from Hermes II.  I'm approaching apoapsis in the next few minutes.  I have my suit on and already depressurized the LM so I'm ready to step outside once the burn is complete.  Once I detach the LM and the MDV, I have to give the LM a push - there's no decoupler.  I have to remember to push it in the right direction, or I risk it slamming in to the MDV once they hit atmo.  Wish me luck.  Log entry: 245 days after boarding Hermes II (part 2)  I made it!  I'm in the MDV!    The LM separated cleanly and I gave it a nice shove.  I'm tracking it now, and it's far enough away that it won't be an issue.  I'm broadcasting my telemetry to Ares non stop so that they can accurately predict where I will land.  Their current prediction is that I'll be about 13 km from the base.  Their rover is already on its way to meet me there.  I flipped the MDV around so that the heat shield is facing forward.  I'm fairly certain that's my best chance of success.  I don't know why I'm nervous.  I did this same descent 14 years ago and I wasn't scared then.  Maybe because I'm alone in this cold tin can.  Maybe because I'll have to take over flight if the computer picks a bad landing location, instead of relying on the masterful Martinez.  Maybe because it feels like there's more on the line this time.  Oh well, nothing left to do but see what happens.  Log entry: sol 1  Touchdown!  The computer picked a fine spot to land so I just sat back and let it do its thing.    It's been 6 days since I've had any gravity, so I'm a bit weak.  I'll just rest here and wait for my heroes to come rescue me.  I landed pretty close to where they thought I'd land, and my beacon is on.  So it shouldn't be long.  I just realized that anyone reading this will either be a descendant of me or one of the Ares VI crew.  I wonder how they will think of the 7 of us.  Grandparents?  Founding fathers?  Apostles?  Teachers?  Maybe a little of everything?  I can't believe I'm back at Mars.  This place was my home for a year and a half, and will be my home for the rest of my life.  Hopefully this time will be more fun.  I think I see the Rover!  Time to go meet my new family."

The humanistic elements of the story must make their way into the film.  I want to see Mindy Park slowly dissolve into tears while Kapoor's face slowly shows the horror of the realization that Watney is still alive.  I want to see Mitch Henderson slowly get more and more pissed off, first at being unable to tell the crew, then when he's overruled on the second rescue plan and just explodes at Sanders.  I want to see the elation on the crew upon finally finding out Watney's still alive, and Lewis holding herself over the coals for her imagined screw up.  This is the biggest part of the entire story to me; Weir wrote believable, real characters, each with their own motivations, desires, and lives.  If they come out 'flat', like so many book-to-movie titles have, I will be horribly disappointed.  Having said that, the entire cast are vetrans and excellent at the craft, and the director can pull off an emotional movie.  Here's hoping.  The second, which I'm unsure how they can convey given the length of a movie, is how much of Watney's life is sitting around in absolute boredom.  He's dead at virtually every turn he makes, so he's basically sequestered to life in tiny, enclosed spaces.  Spend a week snowed in sometime, in your own house with full Internet access, and thousands of hours of a diverse collection of movies and music, and you'll know what I mean.  By day 4, you want to go somewhere, anywhere.  Watney spent 70 times that long that way, yet still managed to keep 'sane'.  It was something that struck me throughout the book, but I doubt that feeling will convey well on the screen.  I cannot fault anyone for that; different medium after all, and it conveys the story differently."

If you just want to view things, open orbits.exe, then drag one of the .sav files into the orbits window (final.sav is the full trajectory from the book) and you will get neat little red lines showing the thrust vector!  I spent a few minutes to figure the rest out....  If you start new, obviously moving the little red vector around changes the direction of thrust, starting at that moment, until it changes.  Hold Shift and mouse over the orbit to see the positions of Earth and Mars with a display of distances and light-travel-times for Earth-Mars, Earth-Hermes, and Hermes-Mars.  While holding Shift, click the orbit to add a new thrust vector.  Press the spacebar to run the simulation.

Log entry, lunar day 6 (part 3):  OK, I think I got the beer problem figured out.  I will poke a small hole in my visor above my mouth.  But not directly above my mouth.  The bottle needs to be at an angle as the beer pours out so that the air from my suit can back-fill the bottle smoothly.  The visor is about 10 cm from my mouth.  Gravity on the moon is about is 1.6 m/s2.  If my calculations are correct, I need the hole in my visor to be about 55 degrees above the horizon.

(buh dum tss)  Now, to figure out the slightly tougher problem of not dying.  NASA sent me up here on a vacation that was supposed to last a few weeks.  I had a special request that potatoes NOT be sent up with me.  You may think I would be regretting that decision right about now, but honestly I'm not.  Fuck potatoes.  My only real hope is getting to Hermes II to catch a ride back to Mars.  The Ares VI crew is currently on Mars so I could (in theory) get to their base and have enough resources to live out the rest of my days.  Also there are women on the crew and it would be very important to start rebuilding the population.  Just sayin'  The Hermes II is a Mars cycler.  It stays in a constant elliptical orbit around the sun with the perihelion at 1 AU and the aphelion a bit beyond Mars' orbit.  It's significantly heavier than Hermes I, but since it only needs to do minor course corrections to intercept Earth and Mars periodically, it doesn't need much fuel.  The main reason it's so much heavier than Hermes I is the food farm.  NASA learned a lot from my 549 sols on Mars, and applied much of what they learned to Hermes II.  Luckily, it happens to be fairly close to the Earth at the moment, and therefore somewhat close to the moon.  I just hope it wasn't so close to the Earth that it got destroyed by all the debris when the collision happened.  Speaking of debris, I just saw two huge rocks crash into the surface.  I guess I should get to my underground cave base where I sleep.  Normally, I use it for the radiation protection.  But I think it will work just as well for Earth-asteroid-debris-moving-at-30-km/s protection."

The last few days have been riddled with moonquakes as the moon continues to get pummeled by debris.  I say ""days"" despite the sun only setting once here.  It's weird to think that a day is simply 24 hours now and not related to the rotational period of the mass previously known as Earth.  I've been tracking Hermes II.  The good news is that not only can I contact it, but also it's reporting all systems nominal.  It wasn't hit by any debris (at least, not yet.  With my luck, it will get struck the moment I board).  The bad news is that it's pretty far off course.  The program that predicts its trajectory assumes that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, which used to be a pretty good approximation.  Now... not so much.  I don't know how to reprogram it to tell it ""hey man, there's shit like... everywhere"".  I wonder what the Ares VI crew is up to right now.  Would they have been able to see the explosion of Earth?  Probably, if they happened to be looking at the sky in the right direction.  But they didn't get as good of a view as me.  Suckers.  Log entry, lunar day 7 (part 2):  In order for a species to survive long term, it needs a certain amount of genetic diversity.  If there isn't enough diversity, the entire colony risks being wiped out by disease or other environmental factors.  So, what's the minimum number of humans required at a genetic bottleneck for there to be sufficient diversity?  I don't know, but I can pretty much guarantee it's more than 6.  How about 7?  Yes, 7 sounds correct.  It just so happens that the Ares VI crew has 6 people in it, and I would make 7.  Amazing how that works out, isn't it?"

It's super risky with all the debris in that area, but you know what's even more risky?  Not having enough fuel to get where you're going.  I need about 2 km/s delta-v to get in lunar orbit, then another 1 km/s for the trans-Earth injection.  Thanks to the oberth effect and the fact that Earth has more mass now, I only need about another 2 km/s for the trans-Mars injection burn (which will very closely match my trajectory with Hermes II).  My current budget is about 3.5 km/s from the main engine and another 400 m/s from the RCS (reaction control system).  I should be able to dock with Hermes II with only about 100 m/s delta-v, so that means I need to gain about 1.2 km/s through modifications of the LM.  I can't add extra fuel, but I can decrease its mass.  Luckily, I have experience in just such a procedure :)  Let's see... heat shield - gone.  Parachutes - gone.  Entry and decent guidance system - gone.  The communications system would be kind of nice to have just to keep in touch with the Hermes II systems, but if anything critical breaks on Hermes II I have no other options anyway.  And the comm system is no where near powerful enough to contact the Ares VI crew on Mars. Communications system - gone.  That should do it.  I have a little over 2 days until Hermes II is in the right position for me to launch, so I better get to work on these mods.  Log entry: vacation day 8 survival mission day 6  Mods are complete.  I'm currently in the LM waiting for my launch window in a couple of hours.  I brought just enough food and water for me to survive the 6 day journey (3 days to Earth, 3 more days to Hermes II).  That means I had to leave my beer on the moon, I just can't afford the extra mass.  I may be the last person to ever set foot on the moon.  I seem to be racking up all kinds of first-or-last human to do something awards."
themartian,3bsgfz,rogerklutz,11,Thu Jul 2 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"Log entry: vacation day 11 survival mission day 9  Moon launch and trans-Earth injection went fine.  A little higher on the g-forces than what I should have had due to the reduced weight, but nothing much worse than your standard roller coaster.  I'm currently approaching perigee where I'll be making the Hermes II rendezvous burn.  Earth is getting quite big in the window, though I hesitate to call it Earth.  It's a huge molten lump of lava right now.  Every once in a while you can see an explosion caused by debris crashing into the surface.  I would actually think it's pretty cool, if it wasn't also the graveyard of everyone I've ever known and loved.  Log entry: vacation day 12 survival mission day 10  Currently on a collision course with Hermes II.  Don't worry, I'll remember to slow down when I get closer.  I tied a knot around my finger.  I'm enjoying weightlessness while I can.  On Hermes II I'll have artificial gravity to start to recover from this 6 day trip.  But for now I float.  The best bed is no bed.  You may be wondering what I use to calculate my trajectories.  Certainly it's some pretty advanced NASA software that can make millimeter-accurate predictions, right?  Nope.  Kerbal Space Program.  I'm supposed to be on vacation, remember?  Log entry: vacation day 14 survival mission day 12  Approaching Hermes II at a snail pace.  I'm almost out of RCS monopropellant, and I'd prefer the event to be a ""docking"" rather than a ""crashing"".  Once I'm on the ship I'll be able to contact Ares VI.  Looking forward to that conversation.  I've been thinking about how to get down to the surface of Mars from Hermes II.  It doesn't have an MDV, that was used by the Ares VI crew.  This is a pretty big problem.  Hermes II has a heat shield, but it's only made for aerobraking for course adjustments, not reentry.  There are no parachutes or landing thrusters.  My only real option would be considered suicide in any other scenario.  I have to remove the heat shield from Hermes II, crouch behind it in my EVA suit, and enter the Martian atmosphere.  Since I'd be so light, the heat shield would be more than sufficient for reentry.  That will get me from about 6 km/s to 1 km/s.  Next, I can jump off the heat shield and use a parachute I made using various fabrics I find on Hermes II.  That should get me down to 100 m/s, or maybe 75 m/s if I can make a big enough parachute.  Here's where it starts getting dangerous.  I could have the Ares VI crew set up a giant net to catch me.  I'd have to be extremely accurate in my decent profile to hit it.  But I don't see any other options at this point.  Maybe they will have some better ideas.  Admittedly, almost any other idea would be better."

themartian,3bsgfz,rogerklutz,7,Fri Jul 3 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"[07:32] Watney: Greetings Martians!  As you're probably aware by now, Earth had a little accident.  I was able to launch from the moon and commandeer Hermes II, which is where I am now.  The food farm here is functioning, as are the water reclaimer, oxygenator, atmospheric regulator, and nuclear power generator.  I should be able to survive here for a long time, hopefully long enough to reach you.  What's your status?  [08:15] Ares VI: Mark!  You're alive!  We are all thrilled to know there was at least one other survivor.  This is commander Damian Patterson.  Our status is good - we are all alive and well.  We even have our own potato farm growing now thanks to you.  We also have some corn, wheat, and a couple other vegetables.  I wish we had known Earth would blow up, we would have taken a lot more seeds.  It looks like Hermes II is a bit off course because of the gravitational change of Earth.  Will you be able to correct it?  [09:04] Watney: Yes, I think so.  The ion engines appear to be functional, and I have plenty of argon.  It should only take a few weeks to get back on course.  I'm a bit worried about trying to land on Mars.  I was thinking I could ride the heat shield like a knee board for the upper atmosphere, rig up some kind of parachute for the lower atmosphere, then land on a net you guys build.  It sounds pretty dangerous but at least it would be fun.  [09:42] Ares VI: Jesus Mark, I knew you were adventurous, but if you wanted to kill yourself there are much easier ways.  Why would you not use the Hermes I MDV?  [10:16] Watney: HERMES I STILL HAS AN MDV?!?!  Damian, I love you.  I thought that MDV was used by Ares V?  [11:03] Ares VI: The Ares V crew used AN MDV, but another one was built.  It wasn't known whether or not Hermes II would be complete before our mission was scheduled to depart.  Lucky for you, it was.    [11:41] Watney: I guess that's what I get for retiring from NASA and ignoring all the latest news.  Are you able to run diagnostics on the MDV remotely?  [12:21] Ares VI: Yes, and initial results show that it is still functional.  We'll run more thorough diagnostics and let you know the status, but if anything's wrong I'm sure you'll be able to fix it when you get there.  Hermes I is currently in low Martian orbit, but I'll have our pilot figure out a course so that it can intercept with you when you get here.  Or at least as close as possible.  [13:00] Watney: Thank you so much commander.  Looking forward to meeting the rest of humanity in about 8 months.  By the way, are you guys starting to, uh... rebuild the human race?  [13:59] Ares VI: ;)"
themartian,3bsgfz,rogerklutz,7,Thu Jul 2 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Log entry: 2nd day on Hermes II  My skills as a space pirate have proven useful.  I successfully commandeered Hermes II, the single most expensive thing ever built.  Hermes II is awesome.  It's got significantly more space than Hermes I, and in addition to that, I'm the only one on board.  Before I started rotating it for gravity, I was able to fly around naked.  If you haven't tried that, I highly recommend it.  I've corrected my course to fly by Mars and skim the upper atmosphere.  This will allow me to slow down enough to get in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars and eventually dock with Hermes I.    When I got back to Earth a bit over 10 years ago, there were a few things I swore to myself I would never do: never eat potatoes, never watch 70's shows, never listen to disco.  But something weird happened.  Something that, to this day, I'm ashamed to admit.  Maybe it's post dramatic stress disorder.  Maybe it's a very weird version of stockholm syndrome.  Maybe it's some kind of conditioned response.  But I started liking disco.  Not all the time.  Certainly not exclusively.  But every once in a while, I will get a craving for it that I can't really explain.  I now have 8 months to kill, and guess what?  Plenty of disco to go along with it.    [03:14] Ares VI:  Mark, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this.  We ran a more complete diagnostic on the MDV, and it looks like the engine used for deorbiting is completely corroded.  We think there must have been a hydrazine leak near it.  It's unlikely you'd be able to repair it.  The landing thrusters are still operational, but unfortunately they  use a different type of fuel from the deorbiting engine.  If you use them to deorbit you won't have enough fuel to soft-land.   We're trying to come up with a way to adjust the orbit of Hermes I (after you dock of course) that would make a deorbit burn unnecessary.  But this would cause Hermes I to burn up in the atmosphere after you left it, and all that debris would be landing right near our base.  Not really ideal.  Maybe we can have you land a few hundred km away, and we'll have a rover in that area waiting to pick you up.  Our rovers currently aren't designed to go that far, but maybe you could help us design some modifications.  [03:44] Watney: Why don't I just use the lunar module to deorbit?  [04:17] Ares VI: That works too."
themartian,3bsgfz,djipaloz,4,Thu Jul 2 20:32:46 2015 UTC,"Log entry: 22nd day on Hermes II  The crops were not in great shape when I got here.  It was plenty of food for me, but for feeding a crew of 6 it would have been tight.  It felt great to get back to botany for once.  The plants are really thriving now.  Sorry robots, you still can't compete with good old flesh and blood.  It's doubtful anyone but me will ever be on this ship again, but you never know when a spaceship stocked with years of food might come in handy.  Log entry: 60th day on Hermes II  Once I dock with Hermes I, there will be a lot of work to be done.  I'll have to double check all the systems of the entire ship.  There haven't been any passengers on it since the Ares V crew got back to Earth.  It was piloted remotely to get back to Mars.  That way, in case of emergency, the Ares VI crew could abort at any time and take Hermes I back to Earth.  Well, you could say this is an emergency, but they won't be going back to Earth.  After verifying Hermes I is fully functional, I'll then have to double check the MDV.  The corrosion that they described sounded pretty nasty, I'll have to see exactly which systems it affected.  Once that is complete, I'll have to figure out a way to connect the LM to the MDV for the deorbit burn.  This will probably be tricky.  I'm currently studying all the parts and manuals of the LM so that when the time comes I'll know what to do.  Now that I have more time to myself to think, the gravity of what actually happened is starting to hit me.  I'm not worried about food, water, air, power, or debris, so my thoughts drift to my family, friends, coworkers, and crew mates.  The experts at NASA who worked so hard to keep me alive.  The actors and singers and artists who worked to entertain all of humanity.  The entrepreneurs and geniuses and inventors who worked to push us forward.  Without them, the other 6 humans and I would have still been on Earth when it was destroyed.  And humanity would have been destroyed along with it.  Log entry: 109th day on Hermes II  Today would have been the start of E3 2049.  I wonder if they would have announced Half-Life 3.  Log entry: 212th day on Hermes II  Today is aerobraking day.  For the last week, I've been checking my trajectory every few hours.  The computers handle everything of course, but it makes me feel better to know the computers are doing the right thing.  The margin of error is extremely tight.  If I dip to low in the atmosphere, I will lose too much speed and won't be able to climb back out.  If I stay too high, I'll stay in an escape trajectory and it will take me years to get back to Mars.  The ship can't be rotating when aerobraking, so I'm back to weightlessness.  It's nice to be able to communicate with the Ares VI crew in real time.  I've gotten to know them pretty well.  Unsurprisingly, they are all amazing people.  They were chosen for both their talents and their personalities.  This not only makes them great astronauts, but also a great way to start the next phase of humanity.  Except for Bob.  Fuck that guy."
themartian,3bsgfz,Freshenstein,4,Thu Jul 2 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"Log entry: 212th day on Hermes II (part 2)  The aerobraking went okay.  I'm successfully in orbit around Mars, but my orbit is not that close to Hermes 1's orbit.  It will take over a month to rendezvous.  But that's OK, I still have plenty of supplies.  Log entry: 222nd day on Hermes II  The crew and I have been discussing new methods of timekeeping on Mars.  It's nice of them to include me in the conversation - they didn't really have to, I'd go along with whatever they decided.  Obviously it doesn't make sense to keep using times based on the parameters of Earth at this point.  There are 668.5991 sols per martian year (or, I guess we can just say days per year now).  668 doesn't have many nice factors.  But 665 does, including 35.  We all agreed 35 was a good number for days in a month since it's a multiple of 7.  With exactly 5 weeks per month, each day of the month will always fall on the same day of the week.  Then we have 19 months per year.  We weren't creative enough to name them all, so they're simply numbered 1 through 19 (the computer scientist of the group voted for 0-18 but we shot that down pretty quick).  At the end of the year, we add either 3 or 4 bonus days (which would obviously all be holidays) to stay in sync.  We still have an ongoing debate about whether the first of the month should be a Sunday or Monday.  Also, someone pointed out that all the days of the week are named after objects in the sky.  But since Mars was no longer technically in the sky, perhaps Tuesday should be renamed.  But we voted 5 - 2 against renaming Tuesday to Uranusday.  Log entry: 239th day on Hermes II  I can see Hermes I!  My old ship!  And I do mean old, it was constructed over 25 years ago.    Since both ships are huge and only have low-thrust ion engines, I'm approaching extremely slowly.  Hermes I in particular seems to have lower than normal amounts of thrust.  I can't even tell that we're approaching each other with the naked eye.  It will be at least a few more hours before I'm close enough to do an EVA.  Since both ships are thrusting away from each other to slow their relative velocity, I was a little worried about argon atoms hitting the ships at 40 km/s.  To avoid this, I offset the ships laterally.  This also has the benefit that if something goes wrong or an engine fails, the two ships will fly by each other harmlessly.  Log entry: 239th day on Hermes II (part 2)  Shit.  Shit shit shit.  I did an EVA to assess Hermes I.  The hydrazine corrosion was on more than just the MDV, it was also on Hermes I's nuclear reactor.  I couldn't even get close enough to properly assess the damage before the geiger counter in my suit started beeping.  I high-tailed it back to Hermes II.  You know that feeling when you drop something and your first instinct is ""please don't hit my balls..."" and then it hits your balls?  Yeah, this is kind of like that.  If any of the other major systems (water reclaimer, oxygenator, atmospheric regulator, etc) had been damaged, I could still dock with Hermes I and just have the systems from Hermes II support until I was able to fix it.  But with a breach in the nuclear reactor I can't even get close without being bathed in radiation.  Somehow the reactor is still working, at least partially, and supplying some power to the ship.  I can remotely have the MDV detach from Hermes I.  Then I'll have Hermes I accelerate away from me and my brand new MDV.  Unfortunately the only free docking port I have is too big for the MDV's docking port.  I could release the Lunar Module and use that docking port, but I need that ship for the deorbit burn.  I'll just have to tether the MDV to Hermes II and find a way to prevent the two from bouncing in to each other.  Log entry: 240th day on Hermes II  Well, I'm clear of any radiation dangers.  Hermes I is safely away and now climbing to a slightly higher orbit so I won't run into it again.  I duct taped the MDV to the side of Hermes II.  It should be perfectly stable there, as long as I don't try to rotate for gravity.  I hadn't planned on doing that anyway since I would have been docked with Hermes I.  Log entry: 241st day on Hermes II  I spent the day inspecting the MDV.  Other than the main engine, it's actually in pretty good shape.  Most importantly, the fuel tanks that would have fed the main engine are intact.  This is critical because I need this fuel for the LM.  Hermes II is stocked to the brim with supplies, including a temporary fuel tank and all the tools needed to make the fuel transfer happen.  It should also have everything I need to attach the LM to the MDV.  The connection doesn't need to be super strong, I will be doing the burn at the lowest possible thrust on the LM.  But duct tape won't cut it this time.  There's a sentence I was hoping I'd never have to write."

themartian,3b1uz2,sondre99v,7,Thu Jun 25 08:39:50 2015 UTC,"More specifically, for Sirius 4, he was just worried about cabin air. The atmospheric regulator basically worked by cryogenic separation of atmospheric gases, though, so the return air would be lethally cold. The water bath for the RTG acted as a sort of heat reservoir (water makes a pretty good heat sink; high-performance computers will often be water-cooled if air-cooling isn't up to the job)."
themartian,3b1uz2,JWTJacknife,2,Thu Jun 25 11:29:13 2015 UTC,Oh OK thanks I get it it's just one of those things that was hard to visualize that makes sense though that it was about the atmospheric regulator rather than just cabin temperature. Thanks!

I hope they bother to show reaction in countries other than the United States.  One of the over-arching ideas of the whole novel was people help and people care.  As helpless as most of us would be here on Earth, should something of this nature actually happen, every last form of communication the world over would be used to relay the latest happenings of Mark Watney.  We, as a species, would care."
themartian,3awvmk,SilentDis,3,Wed Jun 24 06:28:38 2015 UTC,I don't think China's been cut. At :20 seconds in the trailer there's a shot of two Asian people reacting to something. I suspect it's Jiuquan but it could be anywhere.

themartian,3awvmk,teashopslacker,3,Mon Jul 6 23:42:04 2015 UTC,Not surprised. In the movie 21: Bringing Down the House the majority of the people were white while in the book they were almost all Asian or Middle Eastern.
themartian,3awvmk,Freshenstein,2,Wed Jun 24 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised. The director's, Ridley Scott's, previous movie was the story of Moses in his film, Exodus: Gods and Kings. Basically white people were playing Egyptians and Jews alike. It drew a lot of attention for the whitewashing of history and the movie ultimately bombed.  It's sad to see that same trend here. When reading the book, I imagined someone like Ifran Khan as Venkat Kapoor. I love Chiwetel and he was phenomenal in 12 Years a Slave, so I'm guessing they bent that casting choice to include better talent than staying true to the character. I wish though that they changed the name. Weird to have a Black guy play an Indian dude."
themartian,3awvmk,edible_building,3,Wed Jun 24 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe Khan was too busy playing ""eccentric Indian guy"" in Jurassic World? :P  I mean, I really like him, but he's one of maybe three faces that represent the subcontinent in American cinema (Kal Penn? Ben Kingsley, I guess?)  With the calibre of the rest of the cast, they could have picked an unknown and made him a star. (Actually, Kal Penn probably could have pulled it off..)"
themartian,3awvmk,Hindugod,2,Thu Jun 25 03:40:42 2015 UTC,I would've like to see Kunal Nayyar and he would fit well within the comedic side of the story. The only issue would be that he is probably too young to be playing Venkat.   Otherwise I can also see Anil Kapoor (remember him from slum dog millionaire).   I'm disappointed in the final choice but they did select a good actor.
themartian,3awvmk,edible_building,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"Kal Penn's weird history would call too much attention to the actor rather than what he's portraying in a dramatic role. Kingsley would've been a good choice obviously. The guy played Ghandi, so I'm guessing he could play an Indian NASA department chief. He played in Ridley Scott's 'Exodus' so I'm guessing he was missing here b/c of scheduling or they had already committed to Chiwetel.  Yeah, Khan probably committed to Jurassic World. Probably better for his career I guess, that movie is doing gangbusters. Here's a list from IMDb. Doesn't look like there was much of a talent pool to work with, I'm sorry to say.  Crazy idea here: What about Danny Pudi? Dude has great dramatic chops from Community, but I guess he's a bit young. I imagined Kapoor with a beard and a weary bearing. That scene with Rich Purnell where he said Rich was being difficult was hilarious. Chiwetel will nail that scene. And Donald Glover is playing Rich Purnell, and both I and Andy Weir love us some Donald."
themartian,3awvmk,ferlessleedr,2,Thu Jun 25 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"Ha... if both Donald Glover and Danny Pudi had appeared in the same movie, the internet would have shit itself. But yeah, too young and too.. baby faced, I think.  I agree, Venkat had a real heavy weariness to him.  And from that list.. maybe Sendhil Ramamurthy, but probably too pretty to play a dog-tired physicist.  He certainly fits the genre, though.  Ooo, Aasif Mandvi though. That would have been fantastic."

But then I got called a coward for my gut instinct and I kept my thoughts to myself.  The book has a really optimistic output and it stars a ""self-effacing smart ass"" as Andy Weir described in his google talk. We didn't see any of the political discussion against not bringing him home because that would've directly contradicted Watney's take home message and the message the trailer of the movie opens with: That all cultures will pull together and help each other in times of emergency. That's a nice sentiment and all, but I truly believe we would've had a much larger debate than what we saw. I don't know what the answer is (on whether we would've expended the effort and resources to bring him home), but I'm leaning toward yes. The whole world is watching. The future of manned space missions might depend on this. And NASA would get tons of funding and press, so I think lots would push for it."

They just had a hastily built supply ship blow up on launch.  Now you want to risk 5 more lives on another, even more hastily built supply ship?1  All for a plan that involves Watney driving 3200km and flying up to meet the ship in a ragtop while doing more Gs than a human can take normally.  1 Or 4 deaths if they do space cannibalism.

themartian,3acy42,fasterkillpussycat,22,Fri Jun 19 02:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you haven't read the book. I'll give you some context!  Mark Watney becomes trapped on Mars, and part of his survival strategy is to culture Martian soil and grow potatoes to eat after his prepackaged food runs out. Officially, a region/continent/world is colonized once crops are grown on it (by American standards, at least).   So while Neil Armstrong simply walked on the moon, Mark Watney actually colonized a planet! Basically, he is one-upping Armstrong, thus the ""in your face!"" jab."
themartian,3acy42,OrphicCult,0,Fri Jun 19 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yea. It's an ongoing theme in the book that Watney wants some type of historical publicity and amazing famousness after all he's done. He mentions how his transmissions to NASA being in history books, he names things after himself just because he can."
themartian,3acy42,jojotoughasnails,5,Fri Jul 3 21:14:08 2015 UTC,I would actually chalk most of it up to Watney's self-deprecating sense of humor. I never got the vibe that he was demanding publicity. But that's an interesting point of view you have! Did you enjoy the book?
themartian,3acy42,OrphicCult,2,Sat Jul 4 05:56:44 2015 UTC,Of course!  Yea..I definitely wouldn't say he demands publicity. But the idea of being the first and onlys for so many things and having a sense of humor about it definitely kept his spirits up.
themartian,3acy42,jojotoughasnails,17,Sat Jul 4 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"From the book:  “They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially ‘colonised’ it. So technically, I colonised Mars.

themartian,3acy42,ldh1109,5,Fri Jun 19 05:12:05 2015 UTC,I think its better to put it without context. Context isnt a good thing in a trailer otherwise it gives too much away.

themartian,3acmbq,sto-ifics42,2,Fri Jun 19 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"There are some incorrect details indeed, but I still found some decent info [spoilers].   Instead of two interconnected rovers there is one 'Super-rover' multi-wheel platform.   Was partly showed on one of the promo shots earlier, btw. Super-rover also has a crane [?] and communication device installed. The latter probably means Watney either won't lose communication with NASA the second time. Or at least not until the journey starts. Or the author is just wrong. 'They’re the first mission to be on Mars and collect the samples'.  If this is not a mistake by author, then both Ares 1 and 2 were Mars orbit missions only. Who from Ares 3 crew was the first human to set foot on the Red planet then? Are Pathfinder and the first Mars journey even in the film?   Mark carries a sat dish with him after the storm, and in trailer we've seen something like modified part of the MAV platform when he sends first message.  And the much talked Go-Pro camera from one of the spare helmets was modified to make a picture sent to Nasa (shown in trailer as well). Smart move, Goddard, but Pathfinder was cooler.  Obviously was cut to save screen time and emphasize dangers of the trip to Ares IV site. Or it's not true as well. :)"
themartian,3acb6j,tottle321,15,Thu Jun 18 23:05:20 2015 UTC,Just remember that you can never trust a trailer. I think they cut from a shot of Watney looking at a computer to a shot of Martinez looking at his family.
themartian,3acb6j,h2g2_researcher,2,Thu Jun 18 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, good call. Also now that I think about it, I doubt they'd give Watney a computer screen like that, unless that's the Pathfinder display which is unlikely."

themartian,3acb6j,blockanton,-2,Sat Jun 20 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"If you examine it closely, you see that a hand is touching the screen displaying the family. In the next shot, Watney clearly is withdrawing his hand from touching a screen. I think they added a family for the movie."
themartian,3acb6j,h2g2_researcher,7,Fri Jun 19 08:16:02 2015 UTC,"I've examined it closely and noticed that the hand on the computer screen is wearing a wedding band on the ring finger of the left hand. No shot of Watney depicts him wearing one.  I actually went through the whole trailer looking for one, twice, but it's really coy about showing his hands. There's one half-decent shot, but his left hand is curled in a way that hides most of that finger. Every other time we see him he's got gloves on, or isn't showing both hands (and is often doing something - playing with fire - that you'd take a wedding band off for). So I went to the teaser trailer, and found a shot where both his hands are in view, and he isn't doing something that would require taking a ring off.  Using shots out of context to imply certain things is an ancient art in cinema trailers. The studio wants to suggest that Mark has a family, because it makes people more likely to identify with him and go see it (according to their market research)."
themartian,3acb6j,Monster-_-,3,Fri Jun 19 08:47:28 2015 UTC,"In the ""Ares 3"" video, where Watney walks around introducing the crew, he says his goodbye to his parents and no one else.  I think that was Martinez' family in that shot."

They are confident that those who have read the book will see the movie and now they are trying to convince a wider range of people. Maybe a set of people who might not be inclined to pick up a book like the Martian off the shelves, let alone read any sort of novel. Adding a little hint of a family element on the trailer might trick people into relating better to the story therefore feel compelled to go and watch it."
themartian,3acb6j,phunniemee,2,Fri Jun 19 14:34:26 2015 UTC,"The way I interpreted this spot from the trailer (after having read the book) is that maybe he was looking at family photos/videos that his crewmates had brought on their little memory sticks with them, and he was reaching out just for any kind of human connection, even if it's not his family. Like this is Martinez' wife and kid but Martinez is his best friend, so their presence still helps to fill some of the emotional void he has, being so alone and separated.   But looking at the comments here (the wedding ring) I think it's much more likely it's just a tricksy edit and that it's actually Martinez' hand we're seeing."

It's a real trajectory that Andy designed when he wrote the book. He actually wrote a program to model the Hermes flight path with real data. With that program he was able to design the maneuver. I suggest watching this awesome video of Andy where he shows the program. http://youtu.be/gMfuLtjgzA8 you'll see how much work went in to writing the book. Not only did he have to model the path but he had to pick a specific launch date so the transmissions delays would be accurate and the timeline of the events made sense. It's fricken amazing."

themartian,3aas0g,gnfnrf,3,Thu Jun 18 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"The airlock failure happened on Sol 122.  Source.  The original math from Watney starts on Sol 22 and continues on Sol 25, exactly 100 Sols earlier.  Source.  So...yeah, I can't figure out how this works either.  That's weird.  On Sol 387 he mentions he's been eating potatoes for weeks and he has his 5 meal packs saved for special occasions.    On Sol 390 he lists his food supply as 1692 potatoes.  So if that's 10 per day for several weeks then he made something like 2000 potatoes in that <100 days.  At 150 calories per potato that's 300,000 in about 95 days.  We'll say 100 for funsies.  That's over 3000 calories per day.  Yeah, without the hab failure he could have survived until Sol 1415 when Ares 4 landed!  Not truly indefinitely because he would have experienced soil collapse (he mentions early on that the farming techniques he employed to improve caloric yield would have reduced his soil to dust within 12 years) but certainly to the landing of Ares 4, and we already know objectively that he was capable of the trip to Schiaparreli.  That might have been different later on, and after bricking Pathfinder he may have chosen to travel several hundred kilometers to get Opportunity.  But yeah.  It appears he critically undervalued his farming yield.  That's my actual guess, is that Andy Weir actually did give him enough space to be sustainable, because god knows that guy did all the rest of the math."
themartian,3aas0g,ferlessleedr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:30:06 2015 UTC,The drill bits may be an oversight from an earlier edition of the novel where they did evac in the EVA suits.  The farm failure killed all the plants and he lost a bunch of water. He'd need to make more water and have living plants to grow more potatoes.
themartian,3aas0g,caphector,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"To clarify: The farm question is referring to his calculations prior to the hab pressure loss.  Obviously, once he lost the majority of his plant stock and bacteria and so on, the projections changed."
themartian,3a9bbj,yokem55,4,Thu Jun 18 06:42:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the big no-no is not having any earth capable coms other than what's on the MAV. While the story relied on Mark having no communication with Earth, and it wasn't unreasonable to say 'They didn't expect anyone to be on mars without the MAV', any real mission would of course need more redundant communications.  I also think there were a couple dozen satellites in orbit around Mars, Mindy got put in charge of them once they discovered Mark was alive. I'm certainly not a communications engineer, but I'm pretty sure that the multi-billion dollar, 2030's technology in the HAB and even rovers probably should of had the ability to communicate with satellites, and therefore earth.  I guess this is becoming more of a nitpicking at the book than a NASA/Congress style enquiry, but it did slightly bother me that for a story set 20-30 years in the future, the only media brought along was pretty much Lewis' 70s music and TV (which was then over 60 years old, comparable to 1940's radio for us perhaps). Why didn't Mark have a big collection of his own stuff? While humorous as a story element, a small hard drive today can fit multiple terabytes of media. I would of thought that far in the future, there should be no shortage of digital storage space for the voyage and return trip."
themartian,3a9bbj,Kamikai,3,Thu Jun 18 12:15:38 2015 UTC,not having any earth capable coms other than what's on the MAV   The Hab was capable of talking to Earth on its own; it's just that that was the system that broke during the storm.
themartian,3a9bbj,sto-ifics42,3,Thu Jun 18 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"I always wondered why Mark acted like he had no media of his own. If they were movies and music he liked enough to take into outer space with him for a year long mission, surely he would have enjoyed listening and watching what he brought. Maybe he only talks about the others media because we are to assume that he's utilized his own and got bored of it?"
themartian,3a9bbj,rosweldrmr,3,Fri Jun 19 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"I would say the mutiny aboard Hermes would be a major point of investigation. The failure of the supply mission would also probably cost Teddy his job. Ultimately it was his decision to forego testing. There would be years of protracted congressional hearings and investigations into management of funds. (Other departments and programs crying about getting shafted.) I wouldn't be surprised if the entire Ares program was put in jeopardy.   I also think Watney would be reamed to hell for ignoring NASA suggestions about critical equipment and probably held responsible for the drop in comms after he fried the rover. If it hadn't been for that, his return trip would have been a lot smoother. Also Commander Lewis would be investigated for stranding a member of the crew on another planet. She'd probably be cleared but not after months of exhaustive and damaging investigations and bad press. Mark's vocal support would probably be her biggest help. Beck and Johansen might also get into some trouble for their relationship.    I think the whole thing would be a cluster fuck. There would be reorganization and people getting fired from NASA, politicians getting involved and dragging everything out for years. And someone was really going to get nailed to the wall for making a deal with the Chinese without any oversight.   The whole ordeal would probably destroy NASA if not for the massive surge in public interest in the Ares program. It would be a lot of white papers and reports about lessons learned and ultimately they would reveal what we already know. More comms, and given the circumstances the equipment and materials held up much longer than their intended life. Hopefully the public interest and support would be enough to offset all the procedural shit that would threaten the program.   Just some of the things I've been thinking about. I really love the idea of life after Mars not only for Watney but everyone else too."
themartian,3a9bbj,rosweldrmr,2,Fri Jun 19 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the winds weren't realistic anyway -- even a 150 kph wind would feel like a gentle push on Mars.  But, if they were realistic, it would be nice for the comms dish to be collapsible, so you can fold it up during a storm rather than having it catch the wind like a parachute.  I think the biggest change, though, would be contingency planning.  The botched resupply mission was pretty sad, and they should have had a plan in place for sending more supplies before landing 6 people on Mars.  What if the MAV did tip over, or had a fuel leak, or failed in some other way, and no one got off the surface?"
themartian,3a9bbj,EntroperZero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"I'm slowly putting together the pieces to replicate the Ares missions in KSP, using several mods to make things more realistic (delayed communication through RemoteTech and life support through TEC). One thing I realized as I'm planning the pre mission supply drops is that it would be extremely easy to fly out several extra food containers to leave in orbit over the entire Ares program duration, should such an event occur.  Enough for the entire crew to not have to resort to poop-potatoes until another, proper, resupply mission could be formed should the MAV break while the crew is there.  This, to me, is the biggest ARES program fault, that there was no contingency plan to extend the mission if the way home broke down. I assume they'd have coms (or if not, then the entire MAV documentation, in the (at least) Terabytes worth if storage that would have gone along with them) and maybe be able to fix it to an extent, but the fact that there was no answer to ""What if the MAV becomes FUBAR while our people are on-planet?"" really seems... wrong."
themartian,3a8pdx,geuis,3,Thu Jun 18 02:49:58 2015 UTC,"He doesnt say ""shit"" in that trailer, he says ""I'm going to science the hell out of this"". It annoyed me a bit."
themartian,3a8pdx,ldh1109,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:24:26 2015 UTC,"Funny you say this. The Martian was actually filmed in 3D, while Jurassic World was not. Only the fully CG scenes in Jurassic World are true 3D, while 100% of the Martian was shot with 3D cameras. Perhaps Martian was just more stereo true than what you saw with other trailers and in Jurassic World."
themartian,3a8pdx,redhawkcircles,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:07:20 2015 UTC,"I saw it in 3D as well and it felt to me like the problem was that the trailer was edited in 2D to look good in 2D as far as shot selection and screen time went. When switched back to 3D it made for some real work refocusing on the depth of each shot, and some times the scene would change before you could adjust. One of the other 3D trailers I saw had the same problem but I don't remember what it was now. I think it's an editing issue and people creating trailers haven't really started factoring in depth transitions in the creative process. That said, I'm hopeful Ridley Scott is taking that into account in his vision for the movie as a whole."
themartian,3a7x2h,Hindugod,2,Wed Jun 17 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"It is my hope that this goes well.  I loved the book, and everything I'm hearing about the movie says it will be good.  I'm skeptical, though.  I thought Star Wars Episode 1 was going to be good, after all.  With all the help NASA has directly provided, with the amazing source material, the great cast, and a great director, everything is looking 'up' for this movie.  On top of that, Fox didn't skimp on the budget, and decided to go to near-blockbuster levels for it.  All this, for a fun sci-fi 'what if' story.  That's saying something.  It signals a desire, at least in Hollywood, that science is again the 'way to go' to appeal to the masses.  That, in general, the world wants some 'real science' in their fiction entertainment.  I guess the success of Gravity and Interstellar helped in that regard.  I guess the amazing sales of the book helped in that regard.  But it still shows a 'want' from the public for something a bit different than just Bond 832, Transformers 763, Disney 2782, and Twilight 17.  Rather than just escapism, we are starting to look up and out as a society, and hoping we've got 'something' to look forward to."
themartian,3a7x2h,SilentDis,3,Thu Jun 18 06:17:27 2015 UTC,The story exists without having an antagonist. You don’t have some evil villain trying to stop Damon from getting home.     Good point.

themartian,3a7x2h,SenderMage,4,Wed Jun 17 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say the antagonist is not a 'who' but a what.  The planet, the harsh nature of space for humans to be in.  In the same way, we'd say that, basically, we caused this problem.  If we'd never gone to Mars in the first place, Mark Watney would never have been stranded there, after all.  With that said, we are a curious lot, us humans.  We can't help but poke and prod.  it's our very nature."

themartian,3a3fla,datenwolf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:49:43 2015 UTC,"Without the water to conduct the heat away, what's stopping the plastic from over hearing?   Air convection. The point is, having bubbles of air within the plastic bag, those would act as thermal insulation, locally rising the temperature, i.e. the whole air bubble would reach melting point temperature. With a firm contact between plastic bag and RTG the heat would have been carried away into the surrounding air and transported off by convection.  Plastics don't care so much about how much heat (= amount of energy) you pass through them. But temperature (= amount of thermal motion) is what breaks bonds and even a little heat can create high temperatures if the energy has no way to dissipate away.  However I did not see the reason for the plastic bag at all. Just submerge the RTG as it is; it's not like RTG thermocouples are putting out a lot of voltage; they deliver current and even if the thermocouple terminals would have been exposed and under water nothing bad would happen; about as exciting as submerging a car battery in a swimming pool."

Worm is an original superhero fiction that is very rule based about its fictional superpowers and their constraints and behaviors. Also, it features a protagonist who basically worms her way through increasingly impossible-seeming challenges. What I loved about it was that rush you feel when you solve problems or overcome something -- this happens frequently in Worm. It also feels real because it sticks to the premise and rules that it sets up and doesn't hold back much for plot reasons."

themartian,39sliq,737000,7,Sun Jun 14 10:31:24 2015 UTC,"Well, if you have read the book, you recognize the scenes and their meaning. But I don't think someone who has not read it would be spoiled.   He is stranded on Mars. He wants to survive and get back. Science and rockets are involved. That's all you get from the trailer if that is all you know about it. So, in my mind, no spoilers."
themartian,39sliq,cmfg,5,Sun Jun 14 16:40:04 2015 UTC,I saw the trailer when I was 2/3rds  of the way through the book. And yes that was spoilerific.   SPOILERS: So much like the crew turning back or pathfinder isn't apparent until you get there in the story.   I guess trailers are always going spoil. I saw the in universe trailer right before I started the book and was wondering why they even bothered to cast such big names for the other crew members since the story was all 1st person from the guy already abandoned on Mars. So that mystery was already shattered before I got going.
themartian,39sliq,Citizen51,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:57:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same for me. Right after I watched the Trailer (only did it because of Adam Savages reaction video) I turned the audiobook back on and the decision to not do the maneuver was made. Confused me more than it spoilered me, but meh, book was great anyway."
themartian,39sliq,SeegurkeK,5,Wed Jun 17 11:36:06 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I watched the trailer, and it interested me enough to download the book. After I was about halfway through, I went back to the trailer, spotted some of the spoiler scenes people are talking about (yet I missed completely) and just served to make me that much more excited for the upcoming movie. I also enjoyed seeing who they've cast in different roles for the movie, so that I had a different visual in my imagination while I read the rest of the book. Not sure about Donald Glover but I'm sure everyone will be great."
themartian,39sliq,borkborkbork99,2,Mon Jun 15 02:09:03 2015 UTC,for me it only spoiled one event but everything else was still a mystery. if anything the seriousness of the trailer made me discovering the humor in the book an even more pleasant surprise. I'm still glad I saw the trailer because then I would have never found out about the book!
themartian,39sliq,k4zoo,2,Mon Jun 15 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"Only a little bit.  Here's how It went for me:   I saw the trailer. I saw readers get upset. I thought the readers getting upset was MORE of a spoiler because it indicated that there were some scenes of significance in the trailer that just seemed like random jumbles of awesomeness I started reading the book.   Now...having seen the trailer, and reading the book, a COUPLE of things definitely jumped out. When Watney started talking about growing potatoes I knew he would get at least one sprout. When Watney started making water from Hydrozene using fire I knew he would at one point cause an explosion. So are the spoilers? Kind of. But not very significant ones. Is knowing that the Hermes crew was coming back for him a spoiler? Yes, but also an incredibly obvious one. Clearly if you cast a bunch of super famous people for a space crew that abandoned him on Mars while in a spaceship they are going to be the ones to try to rescue him. The exact details of the maneuever that makes their rescue so much more dramatic are completely unspoiled and I think was the tensest part of the book for me."
themartian,39sliq,npinguy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:54:05 2015 UTC,"When I read the book, I really felt there was a lot of tension about if he'd be able to contact NASA at all.  The trailer ruins that."
themartian,39sliq,WarthogOsl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, it'd look exactly like Castaway but on Mars if there wasn't 2 way communication. Besides, the issue of communication is a big issue throughout the book."
themartian,39sliq,ggbrown,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:29:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Those big portion: that the crew tries to rescue him, that NASA cares, that he's stranded, etc... didn't seem like the most critical portions of the book to me. If they would have revealed him working problems and figuring things out? That I would have been pissed about. The trailer just gives the overall plot, but the real story is in the day to day. So I wasn't pissed."
themartian,39sliq,marzipandancer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I saw the trailer before reading the book.  The only things that I felt were spoiled were that his survival plan involves growing potatoes (which is, of course, very early and IMO doesn't even really count), and the line about ""mutiny"" allowed me to piece together the gist of the drama surrounding the Rich Purnell Maneuver when it was first introduced.  Pretty minor.  And I'm not someone that particularly cares about spoilers."
themartian,39sliq,gdshaffe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"No, I had already intended to read the book but I saw the trailer first. I watched the trailer again and again as I read (listened to) the book and each time I noticed how parts of the trailer fit the book but I don't feel any of it was a spoiler.  Maybe the 'mutiny' line but I didn't know what that referred to until I got there in the book so wasn't so much a spoiler.  It's great how true the trailer is to the book, right down to the dialogue being verbatim."
themartian,39sliq,nexus_87,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"Had the book on my ""to read"" list, saw the trailer and went right to it (am 2/3 through now).  The only plot twist that I felt was a spoiler was that the trailer makes it clear that Hermes is involved in plot-shenanigans later on, and by context that meant they somehow went back to rescue Watney.  So, during the whole ""Ares 4 MDV will pick you up"" phase of the book, I was thinking ""Well, that can't work.  What will go wrong?""  Other than that, it was just ""He'll try to grow things!  That might work!  Also explosions! And soldering!  And spaceships!"" which doesn't really give anything important away.   EDIT:  The other spoiler, which for some reason I didn't think of at first, is that Watney re-establishes communication with Earth.  Knowing nothing going in, you might assume that he stays in the dark the whole time."

I loved the clever writing and sense of humor, mostly with Matt Damon's character. And I really loved the methodical and creative approach he took to solving the myriad of problems he has to face. The cast is great, especially Damon, Jessica Chastain and Jeff Daniels. I think this film will resonate with audiences much more than any of Ridley Scott's other recent films. I think it will be his most successful film in quite a while. I can't wait to see it in 3D with completed visual effects."

He had gotten used to having communication with Earth but then killed Pathfinder and was also worried about the Hermes resupply. The modifications to the rover were time consuming and also tedious but he also had no idea if there was any point in continuing then if the Hermes rendezvous had been called off. Between not knowing if Hermes would even be there by the time he got to Schiaparelli, worrying that the Hermes crew was going to die trying to save them, and being lonely he may not have updated the log because he didn't want people to know how scared he was when the log was eventually recovered. Just a theory though :)"

Average height for men in the US is 5'10"" (177.8 cm), and a normal BMI is (according to this chart) 18.5-25, which for our average height is 130-170 pounds.  I'm going to presume he started at the higher end of that because he's been training for a mission on Mars, so he's going to pack some muscle on.  Let's go with a BMI of 23, for a weight of 160 pounds, or 72.5 kg.  We'll assume he lost no mass on the weight out due to simulated gravity allowing them to do strength and cardio training as well as strictly controlled caloric intake, and on the ground on Mars for six Sols it sounds like he was fairly active, so on Sol 6 he's at 160 pounds.  So now we get to start doing math.  Per Wikipedia the one most widely used today is the Mifflin St. Jeor Equation, which is:  P = 10.0m/1 kg + 6.25h/1 cm - 5.0a/1 year + s   Where m is mass in kilograms, h is height in centimeters, a is age in years, and s is +5 for males and -161 for females.  I assumed Watney is 30 years old and got a basal metabolic rate of 1691.25 Calories per day.  So his 2000 calorie diet assigned by NASA initially gives some room for strenuous activity already.  One pound of fat is said to have an energy content of about 3500 calories, so cut out 500 calories per day, or 3500 per week, and you'll lose about one pound of fat per week.  As his mass goes down his basal metabolic rate will also go down, so at what weight do those re-equalize?  It's about 49.8 kg, or 110 pounds.  At our presumed rate of -1 pound per week, that's about 50 weeks.  He's on Mars for well over an earth year, so presumably he bottomed out somewhere around there.  He may have been a little higher than that depending on caloric intake.  Dude was a stick, if I'm right.  Worth noting, he had 4 days of potatoes left when the Ares IV MAV lifted off."
themartian,39cfzp,ferlessleedr,2,Sun Jun 14 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'd add that he was at least smaller than two other crew members, though the NASA height requirements of today are between 62 and 75 inches (inclusive/non-inclusive?)."

They also said in the books there are a number of satellites in orbit for imaging (how they found he was still alive) so maybe they didn't bother putting UHF radios in the new ones for...reasons?
themartian,396euj,criminalist,3,Tue Jun 9 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"You know, I hadn't thought of that.  Considering you can assemble a UHF receiver and transmitter in about an hour, and that Mars doesn't have a magnetic field or atmosphere to keep in the UHF frequency, you could transmit all the way back to Earth, should you need to, with nothing more than the antenna fragments he'd gathered.  Probably how it's reception worked in the first place."

There wasn't even a reference to the Rover, China etc.  Also, they jumbled up the story in the trailer quite well for some misdirection. I'm sure non-book readers think Watney has a wife and kid back home."
themartian,395hto,SenderMage,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"True, but when I got to the last paragraphs in the book, only to recognize it as the voice-over from the trailer, I was disappointed (""Every human has a basic instinct to help each other out..."").    I mean, it's totally my own fault for watching the trailer at all, but it gave away lots of pieces I hadn't yet read: potatoes actually growing, turning on Pathfinder, sending a message to NASA, the crew finding out that he's alive, it being mutiny to go get him, and at 2:49 they show Mark blasting off alone. That's a lot. Wouldn't it be cooler to go into the movie not knowing how he gets home, if at all? Even people who haven't read the book can figure out nearly everything from that trailer."

His whole goal of the audio logs is to stay sane, and let people know how he died if Mars kills him.   Plus, NASA doesn't always use the most up to date hardware anyways.

Hope it's just the impression I got from the trailer, though.  After Scott's disappointing 'Prometheus' I'm super sensitive to shitty screenplay and flat, inconsistent characters that seem too young, sleek and unprofessional for their job. Unfortunately the Ares crew seems to be just that.  Also, the screenwriter is a guy who has written for the series Lost (like the guy who wrote the Prometheus script) and for movies (Cloverfield, The Cabin in the Woods, World War Z) that are not exactly in line with what I would hope for 'The Martian' to be.  Please let me be wrong, but I predict it will be a visually impressive and polished action movie with unfitting, annoying characters (hopefully except Watney) and unnecessarily flawed science. The original book may safe the overall plot but I fear it won't be as scientific and gritty as we hope.  Or maybe I'm just too old..."
themartian,390vus,OneBitWonder,3,Tue Jun 9 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"The comic side of Watney and the science facts were what hooked me on this book. I am also not sure if they are going to pull a full ""nerdy"" movie to mainstream. Looking forward to see how he is going to science the shit of it :)"

themartian,390vus,OneBitWonder,2,Tue Jun 9 15:00:27 2015 UTC,"I always become curious when people call Prometheus disappointing. I honestly loved.  Though I kinda get what you mean with generic sci fi fluff.  I think he kinda knows what he's doing, though I honestly have no idea why he chose Matt Damon for Mark. Hell he seems to be borrowing a bit from interstellar, so he should have grabbed some more Nolan Regulars like Christian Bale. Bale can be funny when he needs to be while still serious. IDK, I only know Damon to be action oriented."

themartian,390vus,jackdavies,4,Mon Jun 8 15:57:00 2015 UTC,That fact they never told the rest of the crew was one of the things I didn't like about the book.
themartian,390vus,nate_oh84,7,Mon Jun 8 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"I can see both sides of the coin on that one.   On the one hand, as Watney's crew mates, they have every right to know that their friend and colleague is still alive and that he wants them to know they did the right thing in leaving him behind.   On the other, why tell them something that they have no power in helping with? In the book, when they do eventually find out, Commander Lewis takes the news pretty hard and begins second guessing her decision to leave. This was exactly the reason not to tell the crew at all, because what if they break down and do something stupid and risk the entire Ares program? (They only have one ship after all.)   I think Weir handled the ideas very well in the Novel and knew that the course of action taken by the book's character is likely what would have taken place if this were real life. Sure the crew would have been pissed off then they got home, but they would have made it home without trying some stupid rescue mission on their own. (They had to wait until there was an actual plan when Mitch finally lifted the veil.)"

The trailer gives away a lot of the suspenseful moments. Will he be able to get his plants growing .. oh we already know this from the trailer. Will he be able to call his crew.. oh we know this from the trailer. Will the crew decide to come back for him.. oh we know this from the trailer.

themartian,390vus,ggbrown,4,Mon Jun 8 15:09:41 2015 UTC,Agree. Watney's humour is a key aspect of him being the beloved protagonist that he is in the book.

themartian,390vus,SAMO1415,3,Mon Jun 8 21:10:19 2015 UTC,I hope this receives an R rating. Just so Watney can drop as many F-bombs as he wants.

themartian,390vus,whatwasoldpassword,6,Mon Jun 8 15:13:43 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the woman and kid were the pilot's family and are in there to weigh the relative merits of risking the ares crew to save watney vs just coming home as planned.

I can definitely see the Hollywood value in giving Watney a wife and kid. But ugh."

I bet it's Mark and his mom when he was a kid. When he gets that first email from his mom he reads it something like fifty times. This would be a good way to show his emotion without just showing a few lines of text. (Think Interstellar Cooper's kids growing up scene, but instead of video there's just text. Not as emotional without the visuals.)"

If it is the NASA flag then it will cause some confusion with the crew emblem. Or Scott will always strategically cover the flag just to screw with us vexillologists.
themartian,390vus,ggbrown,2,Tue Jun 9 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"Nevermind the fact that the US Flag is on the wrong side (it should be on the left, strictly speaking).  Either a) this briefing isn't taking place in the US but at some International Space Agency's HQ and thats the host country's flag on the left; or b) Someone just flat screwed up the flag etiquette during filming.   Since I've seen b) happen far more than anything else in the real world, I'm going with b)."

themartian,392zpb,andyet,8,Mon Jun 8 21:53:22 2015 UTC,"When I interviewed Andy for my feature on The Martian last year, he said that he very deliberately didn't reveal the year in which the story takes place, preferring to leave it as an Easter egg for readers to figure out.  The key, he told me, was Thanksgiving. He had to find a year where the transfer orbits to Mars worked out such that the crew could spend Thanksgiving on the surface, thus necessitating the potatoes. Once he had that figured out, the entire timing of the story flowed backward from that. Quoting the relevant section:   For example, in order for there to be potatoes available for Watney to grow, Weir had to time the Mars mission such that it took place over a Thanksgiving holiday. This required actually working out the specifics of the book’s Mars mission in great detail, including constructing an ephemeris of the solar system’s bodies and simulating several years’ worth of orbits to find exactly the right time period. Weir needed to ensure that the radio signal time delay between Earth and Mars, and between Earth and Hermes, is ""accurate."" And as the planets’ positions shift through the hundreds of days across which the story takes place, the radio delays are exactly what they should be.  This proved far too difficult to do with pen and paper, but Weir’s background as an application developer enabled him create software that would generate and track the orbits as needed. The level of simulation required to find a launch window for Weir’s proposed Mars mission that overlapped Thanksgiving also leads to a neat Easter egg in the novel—although the mission’s exact date is never given (not even the year is mentioned), Weir absolutely has a launch date for the story. No one has yet figured out what it is, but the clues to do so are buried in the text for anyone who wants to consult a solar system ephemeris and work it out. (""What I’m afraid of is that someone will try it and prove that I was wrong, like, 'No, you had Mars’s location off by ninety degrees and everything else is wrong!'"")   However, I saw from this topic that the movie's official twitter account says 2047...so maybe that's the answer!"

themartian,38obuf,wonderfullyrich,8,Fri Jun 5 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"This conversation takes place on the cusp of the cusp of research and exploration.  In other words, at that point, we're throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks.  There are known failure points.  A valve going bad or a fuse burning out.  They sent Watney up with a ton of spare parts just for this reason.  Stuff will break, he will fix it.  That is his job.  Next, we have known-unknowns.  In the book, they're worried about the oxygenator and water reclaimer breaking.  They won't know the 'how' of their breaking, but they're the complicated bits, so they'll most likely fail and Mark Watney dies. Statistics simply dictates that some little rock, a clog, a small voltage irregulatiry will render the whole damn thing unusable and Watney will die.  These are things that, given enough time, will fail.  They really wanted to ship backups up with Iris because of that.  Finally, you have the unknown-unknowns.  Things from left-field that you cannot predict failing, as we're literally running the simulation during the mission.  There's some preparedness for this; they sent up extra Hab canvas.  Tools.  General-purpose stuff.  NASA has to try to weigh these.  They weigh the Known fails easily, and can count them, and send the spares to solve them.  They weigh the known-unknowns fairly well, there's a chance for this or this to break.  They must try to weigh the unknown-unknowns and prepare for those too... which is only possible with statistics.  Look at the shuttle missions.  There was statistical breakdowns ahead of time of the failures.  They didn't know what those failures would be, but it was assumed we'd lose people to them.  Every astronaut, every man on the ground, every tech, every materials designer, every last person in NASA knows that every time there's a manned mission headed up, they could be the ultimate cause of the death of one of our best, brightest, and bravest.  It's a simple mater of statistics.  They hope not to be, they hope they do everything perfect.  But if you ask anyone there, and they answer honestly, they'll tell you flat out that they or their division will fail and someone will be killed by something they had a hand in, given a long enough timeline.  Space is dangerous.  It will always be dangerous.  We evolved here, on Earth, and are not suited for travel away from our crusty ball of water and dirt.  Having said all that, every failure, even given loss of life, means we can learn from it, and do better next time.  The only thing that holds us back is political pressure; while some of it is good (you want to be careful, after all!), you can go easily to an extreme that dooms the space program entirely.  Statistics are weird things.  The kicker to it all is that, if we scrub the whole NASA system, we simply doom ourselves."

That's the thing that grabbed me in this book more than anything; humans helping, humans overcoming, humans succeeding.

Will we see Watney just talking to himself all the time? Will we see vlogs every so often that convey the scarier moments?  Too many things I feel that make the book so incredible (especially Mark's Humor) could get lost as the video medium cannot convey all of it.   I'd love to be able to hear about PirateNinjas as units, the moment Mark discovers that he is a Space Pirate en route to Ares IV, his hatred of Disco, the snide comments about 70's television, the criticisms of the guys back at NASA when he fixes the water reclaimer."

Gigantic screens with the latest satellite photo, a timer ticking down just below, and the ticker scroll below that with exactly what was being received in real time, with it's translation.  For the (.Y.) comment, it'd be a shot of Watney, reading Kapoor's text, smirking to himself, hitting enter, flipping off the computer screen, smash cut to Times Square erupting in laughter as that scrolled on by larger than life."

They burned the attitude adjustment fuel first, to get the range to zero.  Velocity was still way, way too fast to make a grab.  With barely over 30 minutes, Watney came up with an insane, stupid, silly idea to fly around like Iron Man.  Lewis took the idea, thought outside the box, and ran with it.  The software was in-place, and setup for a 1ATM hull breach, no time to reprogram it with whatever figures you'd come up with and simulate.  No time to actually over-pressure the ship to something that could help; most likely safety overrides to avoid such a thing happening in the first place, never mind seals that would burst as you went for higher than 1ATM.  Once the manual blocks were in place, they quick tested just the bridge by over-pressurizing to 1.03 ATM.  Consider the bridge is probably just small room-sized, 12m by 12m by 3m or so?  That's an extra mouse fart.  You make more than that amount of pressure by waving your hand in front of an pressure sensor.  Plus, by that point, they had spent their half hour.  They had 30 seconds or so to blow the VAL door and vent the ship.  TL;DR: Time was way, way against them."

themartian,37m55c,caphector,2,Thu May 28 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"Same.  My only gripe from the pictures was the coloring.  The suits look good, in all honesty, but their highlights would be green, logically.  The rovers are a bit off to me, as well.  I always thought that, for our first couple trips, the rovers would basically be balls with bits attached to them.  They'd also be painted green.  These are purely nitpicks.  I fully understand, and even support, changes for 'look and feel' in movies.  You need to draw in the most people to make the movie profitable, and people expect the sleek lines and sort-of 'off' look that's evolved in the 'space' genre since the '50s."

I'm not going to go see Pacific Rim, and complain it lacked depth of character. It was a movie for people who wanted to see mechs fight giant sea aliens. Plain and simple.

I understand the need to modify the original content of the book, but the novelty and the ingenuity in the book came from his ability to solve problems in a crafty manner.   I just hope that Scott doesn't morph so much that it does a disservice to those that read the book and enjoyed the core motivation behind it!

It might help to think about your standard balloon. They are found for a reason and it is very rare to find a cubed balloon.

themartian,346hy7,dvallej,2,Tue Jul 14 12:47:46 2015 UTC,No problem! Another thing is that the material is weakest at the seam. Like the spot of a weld is weaker than a metal bar of homogeneous material with no welding.

themartian,346o6d,pduan,17,Tue Apr 28 18:55:30 2015 UTC,Originally the Pathfinder probe was built to talk to Earth and communicate with it's little rover Sojourner. When mark collected them up he was able to get pathfinder working again but the little Sojourner rover was dead. NASA was able to get the equiptment set up to talk to Pathfinder again and at first they talked via Mark putting written messages in front of the camera and they would then spell out questions/responses by pointing the camera at pairs of numbers/letters in Hex that Mark could decode.  They were then able to update the software on the pathfinder to broadcast/talk to the big rovers on the HAB beacon frequency. They then had to update the big rovers software to listen/understand the pathfinder signal which they were able to do by having the data stored in a buffer and then having Mark write a little program to read that data and patch them.  After that he was able to use the computer in the big rover to type out and send/read messages to NASA.
themartian,346o6d,criminalist,2,Tue Apr 28 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"As I understood it, the rover messaged Pathfinder and that relayed back to earth."
themartian,346o6d,prefim,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:51:43 2015 UTC,Right but how? He has some sort of keyboard that plugs into Sojourner?
themartian,346o6d,prefim,4,Tue Apr 28 20:08:52 2015 UTC,He's typing in the rover. thats wirelessly sent to pathfinder and thats relayed home as far as I recall. They tried and failed to talk to sojourner via pathfinder.
themartian,346o6d,astroXplorer,2,Wed Apr 29 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"The Sojourner rover (that came with Pathfinder) had nothing to do with his communication.  He originally was able to communicate to NASA using pictures that the probe took. Then NASA responded via a hex system that Mark would then decode. This took too long so the NASA guys made a patch for the rover (that he already had for Ares III, not Sojourner) such that the Pathfinder probe relayed info to the rover. This was a command prompt. This way, he could type into the rover and relay to NASA.  The delay of course meant that they communicated every ~20 minutes. Think of the flow of information as follows: NASA <--> Pathfinder <--> Rover <--> Watney"
themartian,33saou,leftofthedot,13,Sat Apr 25 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to do very well. I'm hoping that most of Watneys monologue takes place in the form of a voice over'd narrative, leaving on screen watney to be silent most of the time."

themartian,33p47k,lillsowi,2,Mon May 25 19:37:44 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm thinking. That never happened. It benefits the story that a) the crew doesn't know he is still alive until later on and b) he makes no connection until retrieving Pathfinder.

themartian,2zz702,jabberwocky360,2,Mon Mar 23 05:14:01 2015 UTC,"Sextant:       A sextant is a doubly reflecting navigation instrument used to measure the angle between any two visible objects. The principle of the instrument was first implemented around 1730 by John Hadley (1682–1744) and Thomas Godfrey (1704–1749) but it was also found later in the unpublished writings of Isaac Newton (1643–1727). The history of these and related instruments, and their forerunners, may be found in the article on reflecting instruments.  The primary use of a sextant is to determine the angle between an astronomical object and the horizon for the purposes of celestial navigation. The determination of this angle, the altitude, is known as sighting (or shooting) the object, or taking a sight. The angle, and the time when it was measured, can be used to calculate a position line on a nautical or aeronautical chart. Common uses of the sextant include sighting the sun at solar noon or Polaris at night (in the Northern Hemisphere) to determine latitude. Sighting the height of a landmark can give a measure of distance off and, held horizontally, a sextant can measure angles between objects for a position on a chart.  A sextant can also be used to measure the lunar distance between the moon and another celestial object (such as a star or planet) in order to determine Greenwich Mean Time and hence longitude.
