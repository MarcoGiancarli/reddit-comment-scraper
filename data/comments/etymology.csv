etymology,3dzvpi,Velinash,10,Mon Jul 20 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"The problem you're coming up against is one of history and accident.  In the case of a proper noun from an alphabetic language, such as ""Radinov,"" often it's a case of simple transliteration. However, there are generally accepted spellings of many non-Anglo names that have just been settled on as Anglicizations through repeated use. There are others that reflect later waves of immigration, that may be more faithful to the original pronunciation for various social reasons. (For example, I know a guy with the name Maras who's distantly related to Roger Maris, the baseball player. My acquaintance's branch of the family emigrated to the US later than Maris's, when the pressure to conform linguistically was lesser.)  In the case of loan words and neologisms, it often depends on the language the constituent morphemes are borrowed from. In your example, ""phenomenon,"" there's a long tradition of forming new constructions from Greek morphemes. ""Phenomenon"" conforms to standard rules of spelling for Greek-derived constructions--usually such words follow spelling conventions of the mother tongue, with adaptation for English noun, adjective and verb affixes.  Ultimately, you're looking for hard-and-fast rules where none exist. History, habit, origin, ease of use, tradition--all these contribute to spellings, and none are any great respecters of rigid form.   To top it all off, spellings change constantly, and some have never truly been standardized. ""Moustache,"" ""mustache"" and ""mustachios"" are all accepted spellings. ""Judgement"" is rapidly supplanting ""judgment"" as the preferred spelling, and so on."

Since there's no acknowledged authority to dictate proper usage and spelling--such as French has in the Academie Francais--English will never stagnate. It's constantly growing and changing by adopting words from other languages, creating new ones, or using old ones in novel ways. It makes it tough for people to learn--or even for native speakers to write with confidence--but that's a small price to pay in my opinion."

English words spelled with double consonants generally are native Anglo-Saxon-derived words that used to have this gemination (or other words spelled by analogy with them).  Words which did not have this gemination, or which have been borrowed from other languages, rarely have double consonants.

Greek grammar has the power to bring out the worst in most people, in my experience. ;)  Still, I would like to know your reasoning behind regarding pheno- as a prefix.

etymology,3dw9iz,DavidPx,7,Mon Jul 20 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"The ""g"" didn't ""go away""; it became the ""y"" sound of yellow.  This was a regular sound change; for another example, ""yard"" and ""garden"" both derive from Proto-Germanic  *gardaz; ""yard"" followed the regular development in English, while ""garden"" was borrowed from a Germanic language into Norman French, hence retained the initial ""g"" sound."
etymology,3dw9iz,gnorrn,9,Mon Jul 20 07:44:37 2015 UTC,"I've lost my Old English textbook but I'm almost positive it was a pretty consistent sound change.  Yesterday is a good example as well:  geostran dæg , which is equivalent to German ""gestern"" + ""Tag""  Yeast and yes are others, but again, I'm not sure what the exact phonological conditions for the change were.  Side note though; the ""g"" in Old English transcriptions with a dot above it is pronounced as a modern ""y"" as in 'yes' not a ""g"" as in 'go' (which is written without a dot). It's an orthographic workaround because the texts use the letter g for both sounds fairly often.  EDIT Here's an orthographic run-down from the online version:  ""The letter g, like c, is sometimes printed with a dot and sometimes without. Dotless g is pronounced [ɡ], as in good, when it comes at the beginning of a word or syllable. Between voiced sounds dotless g is pronounced [ɣ], a voiced velar spirant.[3] This sound became [w] in Middle English, so English no longer has it. Dotted ġ is usually pronounced [j], as in Modern English yes, but when it follows an n it is pronounced [ʤ], as in Modern English angel."""
etymology,3dw9iz,vaschamaschina,4,Mon Jul 20 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"G was said a few ways in Old English:   At the start of words it could be a hard g like in New English (NE) 'get'.     Before 'e' 'i' and 'y', it was often said as NE 'Y'. As in the case of 'geolu', which is said almost the same as NE 'yellow'.  This became more common in later times. The first line of Beowulf, for example, was probably first written in earlier times when 'ge' was more often said with a hard g, rather than like NE 'yeah'. The alliterative use of ""gar-dena"" (spear-danes) hints at this, which would be lost, and otherwise pulls into question the use of ""spear-danes"" rather than just ""danes"".   HWÆT, we gar-dena in geardagum, (hwat, we gar-dena, in ge-ahr-dagh-um [rather than ye-ahr-dagh-um])   In the middle of a word, between vowels that aren't 'e', 'i', or 'y', it was a guttural g. It's a voiced sound, about halfway between a 'hard g' and the NE 'Y' sound. Play around with your tongue in your mouth between those sounds to see if you can find it.  It sounds a bit like you're trying to cough up some phlegm. This shows up in NE spelling as 'gh'.   When at the end of a word, it was typically the same as the gutteral g I just mentioned, but was unvoiced. Again, this shows up in NE spellings as 'gh'. (Words like cough, trough, enough, etc.)  (To understand the difference between voiced and unvoiced, the following are some examples: F (unvoiced) vs V (voiced), S (unvoiced) vs Z (voiced). They're the same shape in your mouth, only 'voiced' you use your vocal cords and 'unvoiced' you don't. In Old English, many of the consonants were voiced when they came in the middle of a word (between vowels), but were unvoiced at the end of a word.  Compare wolf and wolves, elf and elves or elvish.)   There are a few Germanic cognates that aren't immediately obvious because of this. For example, German, 'Gesundheit', is cognate with Old English 'gesund-had', pronounced yeh-sund-hahd (in NE: [to have] sound-hood). Of course in English we ended up almost entirely dropping the prefix ge- which was so common in Old English but which lives on in German. Alike is one of the few surviving examples of it in English, cognate with German gleich."

etymology,3dw9iz,Otter27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"Softening of consonants before front vowels is very common in Germanic languages.  ""G"" is pronounced as a ""Y"" after front vowels in all modern Scandinavian languages, as well.  /u/vaschamaschina is correct in pointing out that the letter ""ġ"" was always pronounced as IPA [j]. The spelling was changed in Middle English likely because Norman influence brought a new phoneme for a soft G, that being the ""zh"" or ""dzh"" sound of the ""hard J"" (IPA [ʒ] or [dʒ]).  It is really modern German that's the odd one out by not pronouncing ""gelb"" as ""yelb""."

Master used to be more widely used for boys and young men, but it did not hold the same tie to marital status that Miss/Mrs. did and does.

In the case of lingerie, the suffix makes it a single piece of clothing, instead of the general term (linge).  The term used in English was an euphemism for scandalous under-linen.

etymology,3dbeuf,wurrukatte,8,Wed Jul 15 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"Laymen in general aren't very good at understanding deep etymology and historical linguistics. I'll show you why:  Structurally, there is only a very remote way for Proto-Germanic *gudan, ""god"" to be related to *gōdaz, ""good"". The latter requires a Proto-Indo-European *gʰodʰ-, which could only conceivably give the Germanic roots *ged-, *gad-, or long grades *gēd-, *gōd-. The -u- in *gudan is structurally anchored to the root, so it could only conceivably give *geu-, *gau-, or *gu-... except in long grades where where it could give *gēu-, *gōu-, which would become *gē-, *gō- in an open syllable before a consonant.   However, Germanic *gōd- has other cognates within Germanic that show the original root does not contain -u-: *gadōnan, ""to fit together"", which has no English descendants I believe, and *gadur/gadar, whence English 'to gather' and 'together' were derived. Combine this with extra-Germanic cognates like Croatian 'gòditi', ""to please"" and we can reconstruct the PIE root as *gʰedʰ-, ""to suit, please"".  The fact that *gudan is in the zero-grade, heavily implies that it was the ending that bore the stress, which means that -dʰ- is not the only sound we can consider here. PIE *-tós is a suffix that regularly derives adjectives from roots, and almost always takes the zero-grade. And due to Verner's law, it almost always shows up as *-daz in Proto-Germanic; it's also the source of the past participle suffix '-ed' in English, but not the simple past suffix '-ed'. (As in ""he was invited"", but not ""he invited"".)  The Pre-Germanic reconstruction favored by Guus Kroonen is *gʷʰutós, meaning ""revered"", based on the possible cognate Old Church Slavonic 'gověti', ""to revere"", making the PIE root *gʷʰeu-, ""to revere"". This would imply a development of *gudaz ""revered"" to *gudan ""that which is revered"".  Interestingly, *gudan was neuter in gender, and probably only meant ""deity"" in general. The more primary Ancient Germanic words for 'god' (not the Christian deity) were *ansuz or *tīwaz. The former in the plural, *ansiwiz, gave the name of the Aesir in Norse mythology. The latter was also the proper name of a specific god, Tyr, who was anciently the head of the Indo-European pantheon, corresponding to and distantly cognate to Greek Zeus and Latin Jupiter. This is why a lot of Oden's epithets contain the word '-tyr' in them, eg. 'Hangatyr', ""the hanged god"".  *gudan only later became masculine when it was used to refer to the Christian deity, post-dating Proto-Germanic.  ... and that's what I've learned just as a hobbyist."
etymology,3dbeuf,suugakusha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:54:54 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, the word *tīwaz derives from PIE base *dei- meaning ""to shine"", which is where the word deity actually comes from.

The dead element (I'm speculating here) may derive from the fact that bets would have to be returned or withdrawn in the event of a ""heat"" in which two horses finished together, rendering the race ""dead"" or useless from the point of view of betting.  (The OED first ed. thinks differently, comparing ""dead heat"" with ""dead pull"" or ""dead strain"":  ""the absolute or utmost exertion of strength to remove an inert or resisting body"", but I fail to see the connection).  The earliest example I've found is a report on horse racing from 1755:   The Odds at Starting were Three to One on Driver.

etymology,3cfsv3,Rehmoss,5,Tue Jul 7 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think there's such a link.   to bear ""carry"" has many cognates in other Indoeuropean languages, widely attested and having the basic meaning of ""carry, bring"", and then ""to give birth, produce"" (skr. bharati, Gr. phero, Lat. fero); the reconstructed IE root is *bher-e- bear ""the animal"" has many confirmed cognates in the Germanic family, thus giving the PGm. form *beran. Outside Germanic all we have is Lithuanian beras and Latvian bers ""brown"", whence the idea that the Germanic word came out as a taboo formation for ""the brown one"". We don't have however instances in the rest of IE languages of such root, meaning either ""brown"" or ""bear"". A similar IE root is *ghwer- ""wild animal"" (Greek ther, Latin ferus) which could have brought Pgm. *ber-, but this derivation is problematic (see Reference).   However it is, the basic meaning of the first root is ""to bring"", while the second is either a colour or a wild animal.  These stems, as you correctly noted, in Pgm. are (reconstruced) very similar.  However, their connection through the concept of ""earth"" is quite farfetched. We should suppose either   a word meaning ""ground"", not attested in any surviving languages, which came from the stem meaning ""to bring"" (like in ""the bringer""), and then became the name of the colour of the ground, then used to indicate the bear,   or   a word meaning ""ground"", not attested in any surviving languages, which became on one hand the name of the colour of the ground (and then of the bear); on the other it gave life to a verb meaning ""to produce"", then shifted almost anywhere to ""to bring""   It is easier to think of them as two separate stems, wich converged to a similar phonetical form in Proto-Germanic and then in English.  Reference: G. Kroonen, Etymological dictionary of Proto-Germanic."
etymology,3cfsv3,dyskolos,2,Wed Jul 8 12:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP's idea is that far-fetched.  There is a similar connection between the English words ""green"", ""grow"" and ""grass""."
etymology,3cfsv3,gnorrn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but the connection (similar to Latin viridis ""green, flourishing"" and vireo ""I grow, flourish"") is: 1. well attested: we have a lot of cognates showing that ""green"" is related to (growing) vegetation.   clear: I know it is not an objective argumentation, but the passage ""green"" = ""the colour of vegetation"" is more easily made than ""brown"" = ""the coulour of the bearing soil"".    Of course everything is possible: after all, Latin fertilis ""fertile"" comes from *bher- like ""to bear"", so it is a point in OP's favor :)  All I say is we have to be careful: often a wonderful semantical link can be invalidated by formal (phonetical) reasons. And with ""the bear"", we don't even know if it's really related to Balto-Slavic bers ""brown"" or to other IE languages ghwer ""wild beast"""

The OED has citations going back to 1561. The later phrase, more common nowadays, is a bone to pick with [someone], meaning ""to have a dispute ... to settle with a person"".  This probably arose out of the first meaning.  The earliest hit I can find for this meaning is from 1812."

etymology,3ca6kj,Rakosman,3,Mon Jul 6 08:39:52 2015 UTC,"As for the why the two words exist, the answer is simple(ish). The split goes back from Latin, which had observantia and observatio, both deverbal substantives from observo ""I observe; I follow, I obey"".   observatio, -onis is formed with a very common suffix of nomina agentis, i.e. nouns indicating the action of the verb. As a suffix it remained productive throughout Latin into Romance languages and also in English. observantia is actually derived adding two suffixes: first, observans, -antis is the present participle of observo, meaning ""observing, the one who observes""; the suffix -ia then creates from an adjective the noun indicating the quality (nomina qualitatis e.g. fallacia from fallax, dementia from demens etc.); thus, observantia is the quality of the observans.   The picture is not always so neatly defined: already in Latin the suffixes and their meanings were mixed up  Similarly, conventio ""meeting"" is the nomen actionis of convenio ""I meet together""; while convenientia was the quality of being conveniens ""convening"".  The picture is not always so neatly defined: very often the differences in meaning between the suffixes were so subtle that we don't seize them, and sometimes they were mixed up (for example, supra, English convention and convenience mantained the separation, while Latin convenientia sometimes was a perfect synonym of conventio. And so probably observantia - or any of its descendants - creeped out as a nomen actionis so that you find ""the act of watching"" as a definition  Note also that each word was created through suffixation has then a histori of its own, with semantic drifts, shifts and such. We can then say that the only real reason why we should say observation and not observance in your sentence is use: to say ""the act of observing"" the more standard word is observation (which also acquired a sort of technical meaning as in scientific observation)."
