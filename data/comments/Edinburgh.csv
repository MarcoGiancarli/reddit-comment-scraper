Edinburgh,3e3fxl,Moondarra,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:42 2015 UTC,Looks like a fun event! Have you thought about adding Rocket League to the casual games section? Been having a blast with that one recently and it'd be good to have some fun with it alongside other people.
Edinburgh,3e3fxl,PapaGrimbow,2,Tue Jul 21 22:21:02 2015 UTC,I cannot stop playing this game!  I love it. We do have a number of copies and there is the desire to have it on at some point. If we have enough people wanting to play it then we can certainly get a set-up or two running it.  If you come along and ask in the casual games section on saturday then I will get it going!  Thanks!

I'm from NY, heading to Edinburgh for a few days in 2 weeks, so lurking around here hoping to learn as much as I can. Reading this just makes me that much more excited to go, can't wait!!"
Edinburgh,3dnacv,tokenfemale,6,Fri Jul 17 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"The Hop On-Hop Off bus was a great bargain as it goes around the city and has an automated tour guide explaining everything through headphones in like 12 different languages.  For one price you can get off anywhere and pick the bus up again so you can stop to eat or shop or whatever.    The castle is an absolute must, it is gorgeous.  To eat or drink the city is so full of pubs that you have many many choices.  There appeared to be lots of different ethnic restaurants that as a New Yorker you would probably appreciate.  We stopped at one place I think called the Beehive that seemed touristy but the food was good and had a nice selection of beers (my Dad had a goal of sampling a different local beer in each country).  It also had a funny sign that said, ""On this spot in 1842, nothing happened""  It is very easy to get around, lots of public transportation and of course taxis.  If you are staying in a hotel I am sure the front desk or concierge will have local recommendations.  We stayed at a self contained flat that had a bus stop right across the street and a pub on the next block (got to see my first Scotch Egg).    If you are a vegetarian I have no idea as we are not, meat definitely seemed to be the go to dish at most places, but I would assume like any large city they probably have places to cater to different needs.  But if you are OK with meat, just about any pub that serves food is a good choice from what I could see."
Edinburgh,3dnacv,tokenfemale,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, thanks for the rec for the bus, I'd been wondering if I should do that. Definitely also intend to check out the castle and drink and eat lots (of meat!). Thank you so much for the thorough reply!!"

Obviously not enough to really get a sense of it but we liked what we saw.  Honestly the whole trip was amazing, nothing really disappointed us.

If you shop online you can get them no problem from Sainsbury's.  So here's where they usually are in Sainbury's:   Black beans - both the dried black beans (in plastic packets, usually beside legumes/grains) and black beans in water (little 'juice box' style containers usually near the tinned section). Tofu - they have firm tofu and silken tofu, and also some pre-marinated cauldron tofu. In the chilled section.   And here are some other shops that will have them:   Real Foods (there are two of them in Edinburgh) is great for vegetarian/vegan stuff. Jordan Valley on South Bridge is amazing - the only place I know which has prepackaged tofu sandwiches!"
Edinburgh,3dm2jp,steamedgreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:23:34 2015 UTC,Waitrose has organic black beans. Real Foods probably has them as well but that shop is generally more expensive. Holland & Barrett is also good for vegetarian/vegan supplies.

What I would say though is, if you are agreeing to a full-length trial, demand a full day's pay in writing before participating, otherwise they're just using you as cover.  It's a pretty rubbish system, but the staff turnover rate is so high they aren't willing to invest in a week's paid training for every new employee."

Edinburgh,3d46gf,everybodyctfd,10,Mon Jul 13 11:25:53 2015 UTC,"Given that the Fringe starts in less than a month, you're going to struggle to find anything for less than Â£500. Sorry mate. There are a couple of sites where you'll find people offering accommodation, you'll find them by typing ""edinburgh fringe accommodation"" into Google.   The good news is that if you're staying anywhere in the city centre you can walk, and Edinburgh's a pretty safe city, especially during August when it's busy at most hours of the day. The dodgier bits that you wouldn't want to walk through at night tend to be further out.   Frankly, if you've got a place in Glasgow you'd probably be as well to commute. Book the Megabus in advance and it's very cheap. Befriend a couple of people in Edinburgh so you can crash on their floors or couches when you need to."
Edinburgh,3d46gf,vicioustyrant,5,Mon Jul 13 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"For an AirBNB room you're probably looking at Â£450/week. I've spotted a few places at 40-50/night but they're on the low end, with most places being 70-80.   In other words you should have started looking a long time ago, because Â£500 won't get you anything at this point. I'd stick with the commute to be brutally honest."

So the prices won't be so high...( in terms of both travel and place to stay).. Otherwise you've left it a bit late , when we used to do the fest we used to book a place back in December... Everywhere is gone by mid to late dec , and that was while back... Some places book right after the festival as people sometime say to the folks they stay with.. Can we book up now for next year."
Edinburgh,3d46gf,_dotdot,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:40:45 2015 UTC,Good post. I'll be working in Edinburgh over the next few weeks too (not at the Fringe) and was absolutely staggered by accommodation prices.  Advice would be appreciated!
Edinburgh,3d46gf,AxisXYZ,2,Mon Jul 13 12:13:27 2015 UTC,"You're stuffed. Edinburgh is full of scummy letting agents who know just how desperate people get for accommodation the other 11 months of the year. They rip people off, and they rip people off good."
Edinburgh,3d0rot,apostrotastrophe,6,Sun Jul 12 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"I would buy the big name comedian tickets now, and then treat the rest as an adhoc experiment. Unless you are going on a preview day (usually the week before the first weekend), then the 2 4 1 deals tend to happen on a daily basis and you need to be on the mark at the Mound to see what are on offer."
Edinburgh,3d0rot,the_c00ler_king,5,Sun Jul 12 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. Many big names will be sold out well before August.    Also, if you hang out around the Pleasance having a drink you can occasionally score free tickets to shows that are about to start and aren't sold out."
Edinburgh,3d0rot,ardbeg,2,Sun Jul 12 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"If there's specific shows you want to see, I'd get them ahead of time to make sure you don't miss out - a lot of shows sell out fairly quickly.  I'd definitely leave time in your schedule to just wander around the venues and try some random shows as well, all part of the fun!"
Edinburgh,3d0rot,johnstonator,2,Sun Jul 12 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Make sure to try the other festivals on in August too, there's great stuff to be enjoyed at the Art Festival, Book Festival and International Festival. Tattoo and Mela as well :-)  Disclosure: I work in the festival sector here, so I would say that, wouldn't I? :-)"

Edinburgh,3d0rot,fraac,2,Mon Jul 13 07:42:45 2015 UTC,"The Fringe doesn't start until 7 August this year. There are a few shows starting as early as the 4th, but nothing's in July this year.   OP, some shows drop their ticket prices for previews, some don't bother with previews at all. You'd need to check each individual show. 2 for 1 tickets are available on the 10th and 11th, and anything even slightly well-known tends to sell out on those dates so definitely book. As others have said, leave room for unplanned shows. Discovering new things is half the fun, and there will be a lot that doesn't catch your eye in the brochure but does when you get here."
