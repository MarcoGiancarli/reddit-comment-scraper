Some time from now, maybe a day, maybe a week, maybe 1.5 years, there'll be something you need IMMEDIATELY. Maybe a new skill came out, maybe FC asked for someone with a covert cyno, maybe you went to fit an entosis to save your sov but only T2 is in stock - whatever the cause, you're going to want something suddenly, and waiting 1 day will ruin the entire point of having it.  THAT is when you spend your free SP. If you put them into AWU now, you're 1 day closer... and that's it. Go you. But, if you save them for something where waiting literally loses you the opportunity, you win.   CCP has granted you a gift of time.

Delaying spending the sp means I'm putting off for an extra day everything I want to do but can't due to sp, on the off chance that possibly years later I'm going to benefit greatly from having an instant day's training.

Imagine if they could click through from ISIS and the game would allocate those skills reasonably.  If you're with me so far, imagine furher. If FCs could provide fits and support skill lists and there would be an easy way to see what you're missing and if you can simply buy into it.  This all seems really reasonable to me.

Eve,3e26sz,LegetusShmoof,-15,Tue Jul 21 19:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think its time we look to do away with time based skill training all together and come up with another hook...  Bring back a full time economist and make ISK the deciding factor in the game and / or look at a faster way to get people in ships and weapon systems so they are effective.  Personally I think a properly controlled economy, as hands off as possible but that makes ISK the goal is a better idea then the current skill training.  If we want to push EVE ahead as an MMO, lets not force the new and old alike to spending months and months on skill trees just to find out the game balance dramatically changed and your skills arent helpful anymore, or you didnt like that class of weapons / race of ships, or your alliance's doctrines just did a 180 and now your spending another 6 months to catch up.    Yes this will take a lot of planning and calculation and should be a slow, thoughtful process (with tons of whining im sure) but changing the focus on time in EVE from ""you cant fly this ship or use these weapons effectively for a year"" to something more logical and rewarding would do wonders for the health and longevity of EVE."
Eve,3e26sz,ShadowandLightmk5,3,Tue Jul 21 13:34:21 2015 UTC,"Skill points and the way it works are one of the things I actually like about this game.  I wouldn't change the fundamental character advancement of the whole game, however, giving everyone all the core fit skills to V to start wouldn't be a horrible idea."
Eve,3e26sz,Transgirl75,3,Tue Jul 21 14:45:34 2015 UTC,... but think of all those poor bittervets who've enjoyed 10 years of training time advantage over newer players! What will they do when the playing field suddenly becomes more level?  Won't somebody think of the bittervets?!

Eve,3e26sz,DaTruMVP,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:59 2015 UTC,"So what's the solution then?  If you can find an MMO where someone who just started is on a level field with someone who's been playing the game for 10 years, I'd like to know about it."
Eve,3e26sz,zer0number,2,Tue Jul 21 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"WoW is pretty close to this now. Not that I'm promoting it in any way, just pointing out:   Buying the latest expansion gives you a free boost to level 90. Leveling 90-100(max level) takes 1-2 weeks, even for a new player. At level 100, a player can very quickly earn PvP starter gear for the current season. 3-4 days for a complete set. PvP starter gear from the current season is better in every way than PvP elite gear from last season. PvP seasons last 6 months or so, so basically the slate is wiped clean ever new season. Player wealth is not a factor, PvP gear is earned with a points system, not gold."
Eve,3e26sz,Sharps__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:44 2015 UTC,WoW is pretty close to this now.   Based on recent WoW subs no matter how many new players Blizz tries to coddle people are still leaving that game in droves. Probably not a good idea for CCP to be following in their footsteps.
Eve,3e26sz,JadeKrendraven,0,Tue Jul 21 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"If you can find an MMO where someone who just started is on a level field with someone who's been playing the game for 10 years, I'd like to know about it.   There isn't one but generally levels are based on experience ""earned"" via playing and not raw time spent subscribed. I think the real-time skill training is a great idea but the second they allowed character sales it rendered the entire concept moot. You no longer have to train for anything if you don't want to since all it takes is either isk or real life money (converted into isk)."
Eve,3e26sz,Bronopoly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:26 2015 UTC,"You make a valid point. However I believe that even if you bought a 200m SP character, if you've got no (solid) experience with EVE, even a 50m SP character is going to send you to a clone bay."
Eve,3e26sz,zer0number,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Even people with lots of experience and tons of SP can get worked by a noob who is simply better at EVE than the vet. If anything I view real-time training as a perk for longtime subscribers: ""You've been a paying customer for a long time so here are some fancy ships and nice things you can play with. Oh, and we are totally fine with someone else being a longtime customer and you ponying up more money to buy their character. Whatever works for you."" Don't get me wrong, I love EVE and think it adds an interesting aspect to the game. I just think it's hilarious that some people think it adds meaningful complexity or depth...because it doesn't."

Eve,3e2as0,hugolino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"two things:  1) can you not sell a skin priced for all ships of that faction and lock it so that only approved ships are available and then just unlock more as you go along?  or  2)if you just sell individual skins and then release a full ""all this faction"" ships skin license later on, would you offer a discount or something so that early takers aren't ripped off by buying a product twice?"
Eve,3e2as0,Vera_Markus,0,Tue Jul 21 19:41:40 2015 UTC,"Having a Skin that applies to all variations of a ship would probably be the best option in my opinion.  I.e. Quafe Vexor Skin applies to Vexor, Ishtar, Vexor Navy Issue, Guardian Vexor."

Eve,3e2as0,Niart_Gunn,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"sooo.. is this skin going to look any different on the Phantasm from the one the Fiend has? or do we have even less reason to get a Fiend now, as apparently the stats won't get updated?  also, can we assume that the same thing is happening for the Rattlesnake skins from last year? just in case the ""technical issues"" with it will ever be fixed of course. talking of which, make them more exciting plz, as it stands there's hardly a difference between the Chameleon and the Gila (or Rattlesnake and Rattlesnake Victory Edition for that matter) besides the XII next to the Guristas logo."
Eve,3e2as0,Niart_Gunn,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:27 2015 UTC,"It's different to the tournament prize ships.  We are still going to change the stats on the tournament prize ships for this year.  Lastly, the Rattlesake is going to get swapped over to the SKIN system eventually. Not sure when though."
Eve,3e2as0,CCP_Logibro,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:38 2015 UTC,"yeah but is it getting swapped over to the SKIN system in the same way as these Sansha skins, as in applying to Gila and Worm too, or is it staying an oddball Rattlesnake-only skin?"

Support has been very poor, 3 weeks before the first match we still don't have proper testing systems and maybe a deployable next year?!  Here something from my fanfest tournament panel notes I like to quote, where Logibro was present (maybe not awake though):   feedback about Duality overall positive, CCP will continue to make it available for teams since they liked how more teams ended up being more competetive; discussion about superchars for training or the option to get free SP to be around TQ level at the time of tourney finals eg ""/give skill"" command new skills and new ships, especially new T3 destroyers, will still remain an issue they can't fix easily;  setting up the combat arena, for example the MJU last year should be automated when a system is locked for a team to make testing easier and less time consuming"
Eve,3e3kb4,DeepDaydream,5,Tue Jul 21 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"yes, some people do this  it's only worth it in whs if ur too scared or too poor to own a tower, or if ur too lazy to keep it fueled up  fit a cloak u know how it is  only decloak if there are no combat probes out"
Eve,3e3kb4,globbyy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had considered a a POS tower but I am worried about a few things: Wouldn't I be constrained to 1 hole with a POS?

Eve,3e3kb4,globbyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, and those are completely normal and real concerns, and that is why people use Orcas. You can move, you never have to defend it (if you do it right) and it's much easier to handle than a POS, and you can just walk away for a month without your tower going down."
Eve,3e3kb4,williamweatherwax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:42 2015 UTC,Same thing applies if somebody wants to take down your Orca. When you set up a POS you farm your statics not your home.

I'd say find yourself an empty c1/c2 hole and drop a small tower there and base yourself out of there. Fuel costs are fairly low with a small tower, roughly 100m a month I believe. This way you have what you need, you can daytrip to empire pretty easily and you have access to all kinds of whs.  This will cost you a lot less than investing in an orca and i feel a better idea than training a second account for something a small tower can do even better."
Eve,3e3kb4,BalderVerdandi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"You should most definitely be able to fit a scanning ship (Buzzard) and a cruiser (VNI, Stratios, T3) with a Venture in the ship maintenance bay on and Orca since it's 400k m3.  A Buzzard, Venture, and cruiser of your choice should be around 150k m3, so plenty of room.  You'd have the 50k m3 ore hold, 40k m3 fleet hangar, and then depending on how you fit/what your skills are the Orca will be between 26k m3 to roughly 38k m3 in the main cargohold; example: max skills with 2x Inertial Stabs II and a DC II will put you around 30k m3 (Inertial Stabs add hitpoints but lose main cargohold m3).  I wouldn't suggest this until you have all the secondaries maxed out, especially Navigation, AB/MWD skills, Mechanics, Hull Upgrades, CPU/PG Management skills, and all the shield skills.  There are some more, but you get the idea."
Eve,3e3kb4,Tiger_Tesla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"As a wormholer I would suggest finding a C2 with a high sec static and the other connection being to the type of space you want to connect to. As a solo player you can clear your own wh content, and also explore your connection. Put up some minimal defenses and keep your loot in a can in the pos and no one will ever try and evict you. Even if they do, you could easily escape/avoid the situation by packing up your stuff and leaving. Out out a couple hundred mill max. Or just day trip and leave the orca in HS"

That way we get soft targets, who attract predators, who attract mercenarys etc.  HS should be slightly changed:  Less ISK faucets. Low risk should mean pretty much no ISK. Also, the topography of HS chould be changed. there are very few connections between empires, all are 0.5 1 between amarr and mimatar, 3 between amarr and caldari and vica versa.  And for incursions: they temporary drop system sec status by 0.2 so for example 0.7 would become a 0.5.

Some of them require different approaches (e.g. short vs long range) but provided you have the skills and know what to do they're not hard.  For your particular problem, you can slowboat off grid (250km from the warpin point + whatever it takes to load the next grid) and the burner should break pursuit at that point, if not earlier. This is the same trick some people use to bring battleships into Burner missions, just get into a fast ship (e.g. interceptor), MWD off grid, then you can warp to the interceptor in a BS or other ship and just fly back on grid. This is time consuming though and I don't recommend it, it also makes hilarious killmails if the battleship dies."

Eve,3e15bo,Mark_Fjord,3,Tue Jul 21 13:42:43 2015 UTC,Can confirm that LML Hookbill with MWD and racial ECM works fine. No need for blinged out pirate faction frigate. Put all ECM on one logi while killing the other. Engage the burner once both logi are down. No need for tank as you should never be closer than 50km to target.

Eve,3e15bo,MartinCorwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:54 2015 UTC,"I've only ran a few, but I used a kestrel worth like 1-2mil with  ECM for the specific bruner rats and light missiles for range, orbit the burner at 25-30km, jam one of the logis while killing the other. Sometimes it takes a while if the ECM jams are unlucky but it can be done almost AFK and you can go for breaks for as long as you like if you just keep orbiting the burner rat. Free ISK )))  edit bring plenty of missiles though, the burner rat use defender missiles which can also make it take slightly longer if unlucky."

The griffin pilot fucked up and got killed before I could take out a logi, but I managed to fly such that the logi got separated (just like skirmishing a small gang in pvp, get them to lose formation). Once that happened, I could hit the one logi hard before his friend could get back, and wiped him out before the main burner got on top of me.  Kite around, get to second logi, kill him, then the burner was simple to kill.  TL:DR  Soloing these burners without cheese fits is hard, because it's 3v1! Either level out the numbers by bringing friends, or use superior tactics to break apart what makes the burner strong."

Eve,3e15bo,kloden112,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:41 2015 UTC,There are guides online for all the burner missions. Most of what I read suggest kiting and using drones though there seem to be plenty of other strategies that work. The most solid way to go about it is to have a friend or two join you.

The trick is not getting caught by long range webs or scrams, so as long as you're outside of about 25km, you should be fine.  Only one that gives me trouble is the Burner Worm. Basically gotta change the fit to all KIN tank and slug it out (his missiles have a 100km range, it's stupid)"

Eve,3e29ob,deliosenvy,4,Tue Jul 21 13:13:13 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, then ship SKINs may not be the thing for you. Unless you look at your ships in stations."
Eve,3e29ob,CCP_Terminus,0,Tue Jul 21 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"But even then, I look at the skin info, and boom...a spinnable model of the ship with the skin. shrug Convince me these are different somehow."
Eve,3e29ob,imaskingwhy,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:40:22 2015 UTC,Being docked is pretty much only time I see the ships up close when outside I don't zoom out all the way so I can't see my ship but so far that I can get a better view of the direction enemy ship/fleet is going or have a better overview of the PVE environment.    However even as uptight as I am I would still buy skins if they were priced more reasonably and maybe f there was an option that you get to keep them when selling your character.
Eve,3e29ob,deliosenvy,7,Tue Jul 21 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"So an honest question, what would you consider reasonable for a ship SKIN?  For reference, the cheapest SKINs at the moment are some on sale frigates which are roughly $2.35. Even some standard frigate skins start around $3.50."
Eve,3e29ob,CCP_Terminus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"If you priced the skins:   0.5-1$ Frigs-destroyers 1$-2.5$ Cruisers 2.5$-4$ BC & BS 4-10$ Capitals   .  Right now the Sanctuary Astero Skin (not on sale) is 1540 AUR, which is $7.40.  So the decision in my mind, is do I want half a month of subscription time, or a skin that adds no value to my gameplay other than visually?  More often than not, I'm going to choose the game time.  The SOE Sanctuary Bundle is normally 5895 AUR, which is effectively $30 for 3 skins. That's two months of game time for me.  So that's a very easy decision to make.  Even with the sale, the price is still prohibitively expensive, despite how much I like the Sisters of EVE ships and how often I fly them.  .  If the skins were a few bucks here and there, I'd probably drop some cash and buy a few, the same way I buy games during the Steam Summer Sale, but there I'm getting a lot of value for my money - I can drop $4.99 on a AAA title that can give me 20 hours of play value without even thinking about it.    These are just skins - and we KNOW that we could apply one skin model to EVERY ship in the game, but we can't just do that - so purchasing one skin for one ship for one character is going to take the above decision making process.  You need to get the price point below where I'm not going to be making that calculation in terms of value, but just say - ""Ooh I like that skin, and I fly that ship a lot... *click""*"
Eve,3e29ob,TheOneBlackMage,0,Tue Jul 21 16:58:33 2015 UTC,This is just how you feel though. CCP isn't going to change what they are doing for a handful of people. Fuck they won't change for a lot of people as long as they are profitable. Here is an example. Say they drop skins down to a dollar and sales are great they sell 100% more. Even at double the sales they make less money. They also have twice as many transactions and customers to deal with. All of which is going to affect overhead. So many people will have the skins they will stop being something special. I think the main reason nothing will come of your argument is because CCP is actually doing really well on the skins. A lot of people think the prices are fine. I actually think it's pretty cheap for what you get.
Eve,3e29ob,aspaceshipinspace,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"CCP I don't think you're pricing is too much.  The skins are permanent, meaning once everyone makes their purchases there aren't any more purchases coming. Those with the dosh and the desire to buy them are buying them.  Plus they really hold their desirability when they're still special. If everyone and their cousin has the skin, the appeal of it drops for a lot of people. I like that I can't just buy every skin and change willy nilly. I have to save up and only buy skins for the ships I really care about."
Eve,3e29ob,jorbleshi_kadeshi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think that would be a fair price for a 'premium' skin or a price for a BS/BC hull skin. A frigate/destroyer skins should really be priced in the 0.5-1$ range and I believe you would actually have more profit that way.    If these skins were something along the lines of what you get in MoBa games where you also get different models/animations than sure but looking at it, it seems all that is done is replacing the default textures color/tones.    If you priced the skins: 0.5-1$ Frigs-destroyers 1$-2.5$ Cruisers 2.5$-4$ BC & BS 4-10$ Capitals    That would be somewhat reasonable with the skins we are getting right now. It really seems that all that is changed is the color on the original texture however if you did a whole redesign of the texture a complete different look (not the model just texture) than current pricing would feel appropriate.      If you priced skins along those lines people would just buy them on impulse I know from personal experience. I'm pretty restrained to buying things I don't need or find not-useful and yet I would still spend money on them.    It seems with current pricing you really are not exploiting the market as well as you could. With proper pricing people will buy things they don't need just to have them.    Just look at LoL discount sales people buy skins for champions they almost never play me included. Look at steam sales people buy games they will never even download/install."
Eve,3e29ob,deliosenvy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:50 2015 UTC,I think this is fair
Eve,3e29ob,MaximumAbsorbency,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"USD$0.50 for a frig skin is probably fair. Maybe ranging up to $3.00 for a BS skin.  They're not useful. They don't do anything for gameplay, and there seem to be very few players who ever see their ships in space (and I almost never see other ships up close enough or for long enough to admire a paint job). I just frankly don't see the point of skins like this. Now, custom paint jobs...that's another issue altogether."
Eve,3e29ob,imaskingwhy,0,Tue Jul 21 16:52:02 2015 UTC,I bet you CCP changes their whole pricing scheme based on your input.

Eve,3e29ob,imaskingwhy,0,Tue Jul 21 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"I hate to break the news to you bud but no one is going to use your  reddit comment as data.

There was like 2 of them maybe three. Better change the price."" That's not going to happen."
Eve,3e29ob,aspaceshipinspace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:25 2015 UTC,Reasonable would be having one skin for one hull type : Heretic and coercer skin separately looks like a rip off
Eve,3e29ob,denisgsv,0,Tue Jul 21 16:52:56 2015 UTC,Yes because there is nothing different between those two ships. The model is identical. Just like caracal and the cerberus. Identical.
Eve,3e29ob,aspaceshipinspace,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:31:11 2015 UTC,"Considering the perminancy of the skins and the fact that we can buy them in game with ISK, I think the prices are a tiny bit high, but ultimately fine.  Just... please... Caldari has SO MANY good skins. Wiyrkomi is not a good skin... Wiyrkomi is about the only skin I won't buy for Caldari ships, which means I'm not buying any of the skins getting released even though I really really want to buy skins."
Eve,3e29ob,SunsetStratios,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"I find the prices reasonable for a PERMANENT cosmetic item that has no effect on gameplay whatsoever. You guys can set any price you want for a PERMANENT item.  If you guys start introducing varying lengths of time (30/60/90/120 days) then you have to make sure they are significantly cheaper. I think a good starting point would be if the longest timed skin was 50% the cost of a permanent skin, and the rest get priced down from there where you get a slight advantage on aur/time for the longer skins (similar to how the subscription model works)."

If you give me a discount on frigate I used for a week 8 years ago, gess what, I dont give a flying f**k.   TL;DR Get off your Hillmar horse and put normal prices on skins. Give us skins for T2 ships. Then we might actually buy them and create revenue CCP.  This kind of napkin economy should be more then obvious ."

Eve,3dzxhh,Fuzzmiester,5,Tue Jul 21 09:16:17 2015 UTC,It's a payment that you agreed to make. So it's certainly not theft.
Eve,3dzxhh,frankster,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:43 2015 UTC,Its a payment that the guy didn't want to make - he only wanted to pay for 1 month (at least that's how I interpret what he said) but was obliged to agree to pay indefinitely against his wishes. Then he forgot or whatever then CCP took money from his account that he didn't want to give them.
Eve,3dzxhh,Fuzzmiester,4,Tue Jul 21 11:31:56 2015 UTC,'want to' and 'have agreed to' are very different things.  This is hardly uncommon in subscription based services. The majority (that I've seen) will have rolling payments that you have to explicitly cancel.
Eve,3dzxhh,wartzilla,3,Tue Jul 21 11:37:06 2015 UTC,When they change the way the payment page works from a default of non-recurring to a default of recurring that is shady as fuck. That's the kind of garbage you see in those book clubs that scam old ladies.

People agree to make recurring payments, but they are forced to agree to make recurring payments, because CCP deliberately don't make available the payment mechanisms that (some) people prefer.  Its kind of like someone pushing themselves on you sexually, but you don't say no because they're fit and at first you're up for a snog. But then you end up having sex even though you didn't really want to."
Eve,3dzxhh,masterxc,4,Tue Jul 21 11:42:05 2015 UTC,That's...not really a fair comparison.  CCP makes it very clear that it's a recurring subscription and even Paypal asks to authorize the payments on your behalf to pull each month. You can just as easily cancel either by canceling the authorization on Paypal or by canceling your account with CCP.

Besides, they make it three clicks to cancel a recurring subscription at any time, so it's not like they make it difficult to cancel."

You speak to some window cleaners to get them round. You tell them you just want them to come a few days before your mum gets here. They say normally we arrange to come round each month and they seem really inflexible about it for no good reason. You grudgingly agree that they can start coming round each month, but make a note to yourself that when they're around you'll tell them that you don't want them to come back again.

When paying via PLEX one can also cancel their subscription, or just leave it as a backup for when you can't afford a PLEX, as a subscription payment is only taken when no game-time remains on the account.

Supposedly they started a subscription service a while back for credit card purchases but only started recently doing this for those of us who pay using PayPal or other means without even informing anyone they were going to do it.  I have never had a subscription in all my years playing EVE until around 3 months ago. My personal opinion is that it is a way for them to quickly make money since a lot of people are quitting EVE;  as most of us allow our accounts to expire and reactivate in the past when we wanted to (I have several accounts as I know others do as well), now they  automatically renew without us even knowing it. That is wrong in my opinion. I submitted a ticket about this myself. I noticed on the last update 2 days ago, I had to resign my EULA, and  the EULA says they MAY charge a subscription (course I MAY go to the gym today too). It just seems poorly written, legally. I am not happy and I let the GMs (as a few answered my ticket) know my dissatisfaction, but what will a GM do when it is CCP who decided to sneak one in on all of the players? now we have to deactivate our subscription every single time we pay, as it is an automatic feature."

Then depending on the range between the ""new space"" systems and different locations in New Eden nullsec, you could build stargates to these new systems and colonize them. But due to resource restrictions in these new systems, wormhole spawn rates and mass restrictions, it could take a while to accomplish that. Then the person claiming it could name the system (although the names would probably have to be approved by CCP) etc.  This is just my idea, I think it would have been pretty cool.

Eve,3dyklf,Stupid1324,10,Mon Jul 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"It would still have shit tracking, bad dps (comparatively), shit cap and still wouldn't tank as much as a phoenix."
Eve,3dyklf,0palladium0,8,Mon Jul 20 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"Its debatable whether or not it would be. The Moros has the highest potential damage and best tracking. The   N  A  G  L  F  A  R has no cap requirement from its guns, selectable damage, and good falloff. The Phoenix is still considered in some circles almost broken vs subcaps, not to mentions its 4% per level bonus to tank.  Yes, the Rev can swap between ranges very fast its crystals, but unless they buff the Rev's DPS or Tank to make up for it cap hunger guns I don't see how you can ever recommend anyone take it over the alternatives."
Eve,3dyklf,simonmaz,3,Mon Jul 20 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"Turrets have a variety of dials to tweak. Range, damage, cap use, tracking. By default, Rev loses at cap use, to not do so would be crazy.  Ordinarily, pulse do 2nd rank damage, 1st going to blasters, and have the worst tracking in short range, relying on scorch to make them potent. In effect, pulse lasers are meant to win in range, yet only do so due to scorch.  Failing scorch then, the Rev should still be the reigning king of range, able to make use of the intermediary crystals to effectively increase its damage output at range, without increasing its actual damage output. With maximum range ammunition (ie Radio) in its pulse lasers and with one tracking mod, it should be reaching out to 200km optimal, 230km first-falloff.  That puts pulse lasers with Multi out to 64km (double current, slightly more than current beam). To then follow this, beams should stretch out to 100km with multi and no mods, reaching a ridiculous 312km optimal with beams with Radio with no tracking mods. Yes, that's beyond the absolute maximum lock range. By my reckoning, the max range beam would require is that of Microwave (273km) or Infrared (234km) depending on how much that last bit of falloff affects you. This would in effect raise the beam damage floor as well to keep it a considerable option. (Incidentally, also provides some by-the-by defense against range-disruption whilst out of siege, but who fires then?)  No or little lock range bonus would be needed however, as to reach that range should require some dedication of course.  With that then, if I'm looking at this right, the Rev would have near total grid range, with it's longest optimal pulse (one mod) beating that of the citadel cruise missiles, at a trade in damage and a toss up regards application. Faction infrared would be the damage crossover, at an optimal of 150km (giving the Phoenix a window of 150-192km superiority).  It'd be the shining example of amarrian engineering. A cap hungry immobile siege weapon that forgot the meaning of range limits.  To make this work, and to still reward skill focus, the rev guns should have their cap consumption halved, the rev cap use bonus dropped for a 7.5% optimal per level bonus, and the rest of the range needed (at V's) to reach these figures rolled into the guns themselves - meaning an all V's except Amarr Dread I player would have range 50km on pulse with Multi (with one tracking mod)."
Eve,3dyklf,kendrone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely an interesting idea. If the sniping BS meta was a thing it would be the perfect counter to it. Back when slowcats were a thing, there were many people who thought putting together a huge fleet a of arty naglfars. The idea was to alpha a archon with them. Yes those were crazier days.  Although an interesting one I feel that even though most of the time dreads with long range guns land on field they are simply counter dropped by short range dreads. Being locked into their siege they must battle it out heavily disadvantaged in terms of DPS until they come out. Trading their cap use reduction would make them even more susceptible to energy neutralisers which I don't need remind anyone the Phoenix and Naglfar can shoot without. Improving their DPS would probably mean they would be stepping on the Moros's toes.  So the only thing I can think is improving them in defensive way. The Amarr defensive flavour is a +% resistance to armour, +% armour repair being the gallente."

Eve,3dyklf,Stupid1324,20,Tue Jul 21 04:15:52 2015 UTC,Is the new Sov really so bad?
Eve,3dyklf,ArchAengelus,44,Mon Jul 20 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"To give you an answer which has much more depth than you probably wanted:  Fozzie sov creates a lot of empty content.  They already fixed power projection. That's not really the problem people have with Fozzie sov.  Carriers just have a ""remember the good old days of content"" mentality.  The issue some have with fozzie sov is that to irritate someone requires almost no risk for the reward of causing someone else to do a ton of work. Just bring in an interceptor that moves at the speed of light and entosis that ihub.  For the 10-60 (+2 or 5) man-minutes of work that entails, you get to make the owning group do 100(+ 20 to 50) man-minutes of work, even if you have no intention of coming back to contest it.  That's between 2x and 15x more work than the troll that reinforced it, depending on indexes.  If they don't do it, it remains open to contest indefinitely.   The advantage of dominion was that if ONE person wanted to reinforce your stuff, it took a while, OR they had to ""risk"" a large asset (dreads, supers, battleship fleet, etc.) to do it.  To reinforce someone's IHub was a display of intent or intense irritation.  It also gave ample time for a response if the fleet DPS small enough.  For a fleet of 20 torp bombers shooting your ihub, you had on the order of two hours to scare them away. Now you have 10-60 minutes to respond to one guy with an entosis link who can burn off-grid at the first sign of trouble.  Now, having done this for a bit, and hearing feedback from others in my nearly dead region of space, I have some ideas for improving it, but these are opinions.  A short list of irritations of mine, and ideas I generated that might improve the problems:  Problem: Even modestly sized alliances want/need more systems for activity than is reasonable to defend for most nullsec centralized markets (which are nearly essential for nullsec entities). Defensibility tied to indexes makes it very undesirable to own pipeline systems with lots of traffic. Most of the regions in the east are giant pipelines with little or no offshoots.  If the goal is to balkanize and make the owning groups smaller, the alliance no longer makes sense as the smallest unit.   Proposed Solution: don't require an alliance to hold Sov anymore.  Corps are frequently a big enough unit.   If the goal is to irritate the people who deal with sov fleets, keep doing what you're doing.   Problem: Trollceptors. Trollceptors are the exact opposite of power projection.  They are the sapper of medieval warfare.  They run around and probe for weakness while being untouchable.  As a result, they can do more damage and are virtually uncatchable if fit correctly.  Think 12km/sec.  Before Quafe Zero.     These are more likely a symptom of a systemic problem, rather than the thing to be corrected themselves. But if you just want a band-aid... here are some options:   Proposed Solutions:    Movement penalty for active entosis links. Could be a web-type penalty like a Cloaking Device or ""disabling"" all prop mods penalty like a Heavy Interdictor. Or actually getting scrammed by the node while the ELink is active. No remote assistance could include removing any fleet boosts from being applied to a ship with an active entosis link. Create a capture speed penalty.  Two thoughts of mine were: The speed at which you capture a node is inversely proportional to the speed at which you move while capturing. This means that an interceptor moving at full speed does zero capture damage.  Alternately, a capture time penalty which is inversely proportional to ship warp speed, signature radius, or ship mass.   Problem: Inadequate risk/reward ratio. This feels like the systemic problem to address with any changes. Currently risk feels too low for initial capture attackers, which is why troll captures are a very popular thing.  There is minimal to no risk for the initial capture event if the enemy alliance is staged any distance away.  The worst you do is lose an interceptor/frigate.  The best is to   Problem: If someone reinforces a structure does not imply that some other group intends to take it after the initial capture event, or even that they had to risk a lot of assets to make you do a bunch of work.  This seems to be mostly due to solo players who run around reinforcing things.   Half of this was true in dominion, like if PL/BL/CFC/whoever reinforced your IHUB, they may have just been pissed about something your alliance did or wanting goodfights (I'm not bitter, I swear).  Now, one man with a ship, an ELink and some strontium clathrates (~44m ISK minimum) can make your alliance do twice as much work as even the highest time investment on the system requires.    I don't know how to solve this because it's systemic and people are fickle, which is the point of the game, but we could make the investment higher for the initial capture. Idea: Require more active entosis links to do the initial capture event (from active to first reinforced component).  A number of links that is greater than is easy to manage with a EULA-safe ISBoxer would be good. 5-10 seems reasonable.  Requires a small gang component and means it won't just feel like chasing ghosts every time you go to scare something off. Would also take care of most trollceptors. Also requires the investment of that many entosis links and ships to trigger the initial reinforcement, increasing the man-minute investment up to the same amount as the node defense. The number of entosis links required could be tied to indexes.  I think this takes care of the low risk/reward ratio and the feeling of meaningless sov attacks.   Problem: TCUs are pretty useless now.  Woo, I own this system:  I've planted my flag, pissed on the biggest tree... Great. Now what? I get a POS fuel bonus? Awesome.  Actually, this seems like a pretty lackluster reward for the effort that goes into it.   Solutions:    Option 1: Get rid of TCUs.   Option 2: Give the TCU some strategic meaning again. Link the structures in the system the way they were before, (e.g. can't put down a new ihub until you own all sov structures in the system, can't capture TCU until you own station and/or ihub, etc.)  Option 3: Do nothing.  This problem is pretty minor and I'm sure there are people who really want the POS fuel bonus who don't want to pay for the sov bill, and are willing to go through the effort of capping the TCU.  (Nearly) Free stuff, amirite?   Anyway, just my two cents. Feel free to rip me apart and leave me for wolves.  Edit: Formatting, and I accidentally some words."
Eve,3dyklf,Primary_of_course,6,Mon Jul 20 22:20:07 2015 UTC,"have to agree with the whole risk of attacking over defence work, personally i'd suggest something like if the system is attacked, after the entosis cycle of the i-hub and/or station is done, the node's spawn around system first (the ones which are supposed to spawn AFTER the reinforcement cycle is over) and if the attacker does not complete the site's after a set amount of time (for example lets say till either the end of the vulnerability period or 3-4 hours after spawning) then the node's disappear and then the system is saved because the attacker did not follow through  and in the case which the node's are captured by the attacking party, then the structure that was entosis'd goes into reinforce  this way there is more work for the attacker required, as well as it gives the defenders a chance to defend their space and such, so all the defenders will have to do is either go to the node's and entosis them/orbit them and whatnot or all they'd require is have one person guard/look after the system till the node's despawn"

Eve,3dyklf,VladVladVladykins,6,Mon Jul 20 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"From the things I've heard from people who are doing it, yea its not that fun or engaging.  Half the people I've talked to say that its been more of a waiting game and hardly anyone has ever shown up to do it."
Eve,3dyklf,vincentwallbanger,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:18 2015 UTC,Whats the other half saying?
Eve,3dyklf,VladVladVladykins,3,Mon Jul 20 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"I moved back to lowsec before it happened so I don't know anything about it, Vlad."
Eve,3dyklf,dragonoid44,7,Tue Jul 21 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, because in the old sov system you actually had to risk something to get sov. Now you can hop in your little retarded atron and annoy people."
Eve,3dyklf,Stupid1324,5,Mon Jul 20 20:05:52 2015 UTC,Surely you can just undock and kill said atron though?
Eve,3dyklf,meandeane651,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:08 2015 UTC,Replace the atron with a stiletto and factor in that the attacker will simply go red on his E-link and burn off and away the moment he senses any kind of threat on short scan and things get kind of annoying regardless of what your indexes are.  The barrier for entry to sov was far too high under the dominion system.  Aegis overcorrects the problem and goes too far in the other direction.

Eve,3dyklf,Stupid1324,13,Mon Jul 20 19:08:18 2015 UTC,"The problem was never the mechanics, it was noobs clinging to coalitions and bluing everyone that was a threat, the mechanics worked perfectly fine until people started setting up 50k strong coalitions, which really all stems from the introduction of TIDI, the need for more bums on seats increased because the server could cope with more people and everyone knows that the guy with the most drooling F1 monkeys is 9/10 the guy that wins."
Eve,3dyklf,Silent_As_The_Grave_,31,Mon Jul 20 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Steps needed to be taken so those drooling F1 monkey can't bail each other out from across the map. It is impossible to know the intentions behind each jump. Is this pilot moving to new space? Road trip? Dog piling on a titan kill mail? Going out of their way to make sure that 100 man new blood alliance can't take a single system by teaming up with other major alliances?  Power projection used to function off wine taste with a beer budget. Not anymore. I think what we mostly hear is the groups who are screaming loudly because they are choosing not to explore other options that are better for the game. So they are taking their ball and threatening to go home. Hoping that one day the rules will be reversed to suit their specific play style.

Eve,3dyklf,0palladium0,9,Mon Jul 20 19:24:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of the reasons people find it bad is because we haven't adapted yet, but for the most part it's because it encourages dull gameplay:   Troll ceptors and oversized prop-mod cruisers are boring as fuck to deal with: not that it isn't easy to stop them, it's just that it's boring chasing a 10k/s crusader/cynabal off a grid for 4 hours or more. ECM is the best counter to entosis so far: a dozen meta 0 griffins landing at 80 and jamming out entosis ships is a legitimate way of defending your sov long enough for you to form up/travel from the other side of the region. Alternatively it's a great way of winning a war by just making the other side biomass all their characters or move back to LS because sov just isn't worth it.  Actively defending your sov against attackers adds nothing to your defence multiplyer; at some point every group in null is going to realise that to hold choke point or jump bridge system we are going to have forced mining/ratting ops. Case in point: F-QQ5N . No-one rats or mines there because we have much better systems all around it for doing that, but we don't want to lose it because it's right in the middle of the systems we do live in and use all the time. If someone took that system it would be a pain in the arse. We defend it all the time and when someone comes in to try entosis it we deal with it, but the mechanics punish us for not wanting to rat there. There are too many nodes that spawn for the capture event. It both takes too long to capture/un-reinforce structures that are uncontested and when you do contest them it's too easy to make it painful without actually committing to a fight (see points 1 and 2). So many nodes also mean that a lot of the time it's just a cat and mouse games between nodes instead of fighting. Roaming and fun-fleets are much fewer and far between: you can't have all your active pilots roaming 20+ jumps from home as that leaves you super vulnerable to even a small gang turning up and RFing all your shit.   Fozziesov is almost there: with a little bit of tweaking it could create a situation where someone entosising your station 2 jumps out means you're in for a good fight, but at the moment we have a situation where no-one wants to FC or join fleets to defend sov because it's mostly just bring ECM or bring a ceptor. Some people have been getting good fights from the system but at the moment it's mostly just trolling.  I've posted it before but this is my fix for fozziesov:    Triple the mass addition for entosis links. Make it impossible to fit a cloak + entosis Entosis links give you -50% speed when active 3x sensor strength when link is active 150km max range for T2 link Nodes start out at 5 spawned and it is first to 3 but with tennis rules: you have to win by two nodes. This means that if you provide a lot of resistance you can technically stretch it on forever, but uncontested it only takes about 30 minutes to un-ref your stuff.    This would still make holding sov you don't live in a PIA but it would drastically reduce the amount of ""chasing ghosts"" feeling with the system. The other fix is to make it so the link can only be fit on a BC or larger hulls, but I think that puts too much artificial constraint on what people can bring.  My fix doesn't resolve the issue of forced mining ops in important systems but honestly I can't think of a way that could be introduced without being abusable with alts. It also doesn't address the fact that roaming is actively discouraged under this system, but I think that's an aspect we're going to have to adapt around.  TL/DR: Fozziesov encourages risk averse shitler tactics instead of small scale brawls, which would be much more fun."
Eve,3dyklf,foundryguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that you said that a lot of it is because we haven't adapted yet. I think that the entosis fix you proposed works, and I think implementing that and then waiting 3 or so months to let the system settle would be a good idea."
Eve,3dyklf,JackRyan13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"Nevermind, didn't read your whole post properly.   The other fix is to make it so the link can only be fit on a BC or larger hulls, but I think that puts too much artificial constraint on what people can bring   Wouldn't this promote more fleets? Sure you'd be pretty restricted on who could actually use the entosis link but not only would larger hulls have more of a reason to be used, you'd have to bring a properly balanced fleet in order to defend your Entosis ships which means frigs, dessies, cruisers all being used with your bigger hulls to counter their bigger hulls. Or am I being a starry eyed newbie hoping for a fix to bring in more diversity."

Eve,3dyklf,TzuWu,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"The KM explanation was just a small part of what I was talking about. I never gave a shit about a KM of an inanimate object to be honest. I'm just not sure whats worse, grinding structures or this. At least with structure grinding it almost always lead to some kind of fight. With the small sample size of what I've experienced with the new system, it dosent seem to be the case as much.I just prefer fighting over a system to be in said system, not hurf blurfing around in the entire constellation.My point about the Ihub exploding with magic was kind of the point. Why should an entosis link make something explode, just dosen't seem to fit in the games mechanics or make sense."
Eve,3dyklf,Stupid1324,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yet you mentioned that twice, so I don't think it really is as trivial as you say.  Honestly you have either lived under a rock or simply never lived in nullsec, because 999/1000 times grinding structures never ended in a fight, it was blue ball city and you would grind how many timers just on a station only for them to show on the last timer and save it? The only thing missing from todays sov from dominion is that you could simply bring more people/bigger shit and speed up the grinding, where as now the time is set whatever the weather.  This new sov has been in a week, it will get tweaked and the sov we see now will almost certainly not be the sov we see in a years time, the general idea will stay the same but the details will no doubt be tweaked massively as it progresses."

I'm not logging in tonight even just to chat to corp because theres pressure to be in fleet.  I think someone said 6 more systems tickled yesterday, so thats 6 more fights over the next few days. Its to easy for people to force a fleet, and they aren't even showing up to half the timers just forcing us to stop what we are doing and form up and do nothing. The barrier to being a pain in the arse is so low.  Fleets are less interesting as we are downgrading due to the fact we are loosing so many ships per day now. So its all T1 cruiser F1 fleets.  I'm sure this will die down at some point. But I've already unsubbed, 4 weeks left of play and currently I'm not renewing my usual quarterly sub. I don't care, I've lost interest already.

I haven't been on the receiving end yet, but I have heard other people stripped down.   Its basically another group saying, we have a 20 man squad and we want a fight. We don't even want your sov but if you don't show up we'll take it just to be dicks. Atleast one fleet that formed didn't even have enotisis ships in it, they literally just made us stop what we where doing so they could have a good time. Defending sov is boring as shit.  And I'm sitting here going.. why am I in null? and the answer I came to was I don't want to be anymore. And after 5 or 6 years of playing I'm out. I don't care anymore.

Eve,3dyklf,Araneatrox,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:51 2015 UTC,"Its not an increase in content I've seen, its an onslaught. Every single system we owned had people using entosis links in it on Friday. Come the weekend we had to have a standing fleet having to protect it, that fleet became less and less fun as the next timer went off. Each day was 6-8 hours of fleets. Comms turned into stressed people yelling. By the end of the weekend that was it, I thought 'I actually hated that weekend those fleets became awful'.  Maybe if we where a coalition sized group it might of been fun. But we aren't we are small and struggle to keep fleets above 30. And when we had multiple fleets of 30 roaming our systems to take down it was awful.   I might go back to goons if I have a change of heart in the next month, but I don't want to be in a smaller sov group again. Its not fun being outnumber 3:1 and having people kick your sand castles over all day then run away laughing."
Eve,3dyklf,Nachoes,4,Tue Jul 21 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts. Maybe it is good for the game? Because if you can only have ~30 people fleets, maybe you should have only 2 or 3 adjacent systems, so you can defend properly?"
Eve,3dyklf,MukkBarovian,5,Tue Jul 21 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Im not going to disagree, although I think this new system really favours larger groups over smaller groups... so going to smaller amount of sov systems is suicide. You instead need to merge and recruit, shrinking won't work at all.  We only have [ redacted ].  Its just 3 timers in one system is a minimum of an hour per timer.   The problem is... if we only had 3 systems... we still have 9 timers to go off causing 6 hours of fighting per weekend. If you put up a good fight, people will be back the next weekend because you are tough. If we rolled over, people would 100% guarantee hitting us because its an easy beat.  Your solution is basically try to hide amongst the crowd instead of addressing the issue that anyone can force a fight without any commitment or repercussions... and putting up a fight has no benefit at this point except for a guaranteed fight which might not be a pleasant affair. If anyone wanting to have a 6 hour fleet they will be pick 3 small alliances, set off the timers, slam them one after the other as the timers come up.  It also doesn't address the issue of smaller space = smaller profits = harder to defend against wealthier PVP groups. So what you undock in is progressively going to worse than what a large alliance will bring... the only perk is they probably don't want your space anyway... just to farm you for kills.   Coming in from low sec, or wandering a from a region over, tripping your timers, then bringing in a PVP fleet to fight because you have no choice. If you are small you have to undock, you have to die.  I'm at a point from what I saw in the weekend of loose-loose for small alliances. Basically either fold into a larger group who can pad out a fleet, recruit more people from hi sec, or pack it in. Theres no reason to be some one elses kicking toy, whats the perk to holding sov now? you are just a target to get raided... at potentially lower income.  We along with everyone else we have been recruiting like mad, trying to boost numbers, trying to offset this. But we can't compete with established groups, who would join a piss ant alliance when they can join a trainee wing of giant coalition.   If you leave hi-sec for null are you going to join no perks no thrills picked on alliance... or pandemic horde ... or karma fleet... or whom ever. Join a group that struggles to have SRP cash, or a group that will hand you ships if you're broke.  Folding into a larger alliance is no doubt going to come with renter tax... because you are on the backfoot in the negation... they don't need you the way you need them. I don't see that as healthy for new alliances growing in size, and I sure as hell don't see it healthy in terms of making some good ISK so Ic an fly some cool ships. I see it as shrink loose money ... join a protection racquet... loose money.  The change to eve is here, and I'm prepared to admit the future for what we set up is over, we are now playing the game in a way it isn't designed for anymore and the alternative has little appeal to me. I can't be bothered going through the effort of starting again... so I'm out. Its that simple."

If you bring anything like the sov-warfare fleets of old, you can drop a triage carrier on every single entosis-fuckable structure, light them all up, and viola!  You just created hundreds of nodes for the defender to defend or for you to have to grind if they play the don't give a fuck card, and they probably will.  No.  Seriously.  Hundreds.  Do the math.  I don't think we're going to throw our backs into this the way we threw our backs into tower spam a decade ago.

The only reason why trollceptors can troll is because players don't commit to defending - primarily because the space isn't worth defending."
Eve,3dyklf,wartzilla,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:10 2015 UTC,saccing one of your guns or siege for a link/cyno  great plan m8r
Eve,3dyklf,CommanderShepderp,8,Mon Jul 20 19:25:08 2015 UTC,"He's right in saying that the entosis link on a dreadnaught would stop the interceptor capping it. Though if it takes any entosis damage it would take 5x as long to fix it.  I can see a niche role for the dreadnought or carrier which be using its siege so it can't be jammed, so unless they bring enough dps to break your tank, they cannot turn your entosis off."
Eve,3dyklf,khaelian,7,Mon Jul 20 18:20:51 2015 UTC,It'd probably be more doable in a Golem. Just fit for cargo space and carry enough cap boosters to dual-XLASB you through an entosis cycle.

Eve,3dyklf,Artichoke11,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:33 2015 UTC,Well aside from the obvious negative aspects of using an entosis with a cap; Archons are cheaper and can tank even more while also having a considerably stronger capacitor.
Eve,3dyklf,ArchAengelus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:09 2015 UTC,It has 4 high slots 3 for guns and 1 for a siege module. Unless you want to gimp the hell out of it you really are not going to be fitting an entosis module on it.

The entosising is a great mechanic in the way that its easy to escalate upon.   Entosis cepter is doing its thing while two confessors are protecting. Hostile dramiel, followed by a garmur joins field. They ping in and out trying to take shoots at the ceptor, which got a few mins left of the cycle. We call for backup. While they are on route a cerb lands on field and the two frigs engage aswell. We mwd out while shooting the tacklers and eventually get the confessors out while our ceptor dies, but finishes the cycle. Our fleet is on the other side of gate and the hostiles follow us, we have a brawl.  Stuff like this happens multiple times a day for us. Great content, much fun!"

Max is maybe 4.5b isk/hr. Of course, that's divided between fleet members, so you need to consider that.  Consider also the cost and time of finding an unoccupied wormhole, setting up towers, buying and importing capitals, rolling holes, making bookmarks, etc.  Furthermore you will get attacked, maybe even ganked. Logoff traps happen if you're not in the WHCFC. The chance to lose billions is very real.  So yes, capital escalations (either C5 or C6 - they're the same) are extremely profitable, but they require massive investments of SP, isk, and time. Plus, if it takes you 4-5 people to run them (likely unless you have many capital accounts) the isk is divided. Still, making over 300m isk/hr/member is totally possible, and you can go much higher than that if you're good at it.  There are other things you can do in WH space that make significant isk/hr but require MUCH less investment of SP/isk. C5 solo data sites come to mind, as does gas mining. Of course, those still require you to know WTF you're doing, and to be a competent scanner/scout. Anyway, convo me for more if you're interested. I've been doing wormholes for years."

Eve,3dyo36,lord_maldoror,32,Mon Jul 20 16:38:25 2015 UTC,What are you guys up to now? This is all from like 2013/4
Eve,3dyo36,Fea_wen,43,Mon Jul 20 16:51:42 2015 UTC,"Mostly having some fun with Nestors (great ship) when we're on. I'd joke that you'll read about it in 2017 but hopefully I won't fall that far behind.  I'm not sure whether in this new, de-centralised Eve there will be a need for the industrial weaponry covered in the OP - but we'll see. Regardless, the key to Eve is the sense of what 'happened', and therefore past and present should be weighed equally.   We play a lot of games together - right now we have ARK servers, Killing Floor servers and spend a good deal of time boating in WoWS. But Eve is special and will always be 'the game' to us. It's also the only game that segues into other areas of the RnK lifestyle, such as urban exploration. I'd love to call an op to (re)discover Jack Cade's cavern."
Eve,3dyo36,Avastz,72,Mon Jul 20 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"I feel I should illuminate the comparison between Eve and Urban Exploration a little more, since it may seem a rather odd observation.  The first point is that if you browse the posts on a site like 28dayslater, you'll find that the different 'operations' are presented in threads much like Eve battles are, with photos in lieu of screenshots. Each report, be it an abandoned mental hospital or a disused military bunker, provides a window into something very real but very hidden.   Eve is hidden from daily life, too. Talking about Eve is like sharing a hidden language. I've noticed people who don't play Eve sometimes wander into this subreddit and remark upon how utterly obtuse but utterly fascinating everything is. It's a window into a virtual world that lives in the underbelly of the internet.   When you enter an abandoned Tube Station - by whatever means - you have a similar sense of being witness to something hidden and transient. You share it with the few people who understand it and hundreds of feet above, the world ticks on regardless.  Eve is the only game I've ever played where I can imagine feeling nostalgic in my old age when talking to a fellow player. Yes, I may know my way around de_dust2 until the day I die and I know all the weakspots on an IS-7. But the only people I'll seek out in the Retirement home will be those who have seen New Eden."

Eve,3dyo36,Snoowi,7,Mon Jul 20 17:14:32 2015 UTC,If you check out their killboard their current style is.  1: Be in C5 with https://adashboard.info/intel/dscan/view/hPrDzJrs and a Nag (and maybe another cap?).   2: Scan down another C5.  3: Gank site runners if they're farming.  4: Otherwise safelog the whole fleet.  5: Wait for siterunners and then kill them.  6: Repeat.  They safelogged in my jewhole on May 31st and I couldn't get a locator hit on them + they didn't get kills in another hole until June 14th so it kinda put a damper on my farming.
Eve,3dyo36,Kingkertal,4,Mon Jul 20 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"Also /u/lord_maldoror: for fun, do you remember how long you guys were actually in J135653 between here and here?"
Eve,3dyo36,Snoowi,7,Mon Jul 20 18:33:23 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to remember now which system the fleet was logged off in, between ops. However, I don't recall us lying in wait for anyone's caps at that time - if we were there it was just a motel of opportunity. It can often be weeks between wormhole ops due to the busy nature of RL life (combined with limited reserves and little desire to recruit), especially when there is K-space action. This was also around the time of ARK's release, which created the inevitable mission of making Eld leap into a pit of spiders."
Eve,3dyo36,W33dlord_Bonerhitler,4,Mon Jul 20 19:20:08 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I saw the fleet come in but I didn't see them leave, and  I had like 90 of you guys/alts watchlisted but couldn't manage to find a hunter cloaked in my hole which was driving me crazy.

Little trinkets include the actual campaign whiteboard we used on Tindermoat. There's something satisfying about tracking a virtual/digital fleet with old fashioned paper stick-on markers as they swerve between a dozen lurking interdictors. A dustpan & brush for toy soldiers would be a nice embellishment next time, although whisky and cigars are well covered. (Sadly, I suspect that even the next campaign won't have Geishas to move the markers for us, whilst elegantly bowing to  refill liquid nitrogen on PCs at suitable intervals).  At any rate, it remains my goal, one day, to unfurl an Eve map with the dazzling panache of General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett.  You can also enjoy the intriguing reaction of a hostile FC pulling off a rather impressive pipebomb, and then finding himself back at the scene of his victory, in warp to the same gate in the same system. Circle of life, and all that."

Nearly all our kills come from our own ops - we have no people joining blue fleets and getting in on all their mails.   Eve is a long game - there aren't many people in Eve who have been as active as our core group over the last decade. All our hostiles who still exist from the old days are changed beyond recognition in terms of their personnel and even their culture. We are unchanged.  Killmails are great and all but we've had a fill to last a lifetime - it's the stories that keep the wheels turning. For example, we pipebombed Brave three times in a few days (one of which being the strike in 'This is Eve') but after that I called a halt to it. Killmails are only valuable as an inventory to past memories - we play for narrative and it seemed inelegant to continue.  Sometimes we let people go (even a capital in structure) because it pleases us. If you can't be whimsical, you don't have enough power over your surroundings."
Eve,3dyo36,159Pinky,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:45 2015 UTC,OP literally wrote paragraphs about how they all play other games together.

Really, they have no need to create what you're asking for. The 3rd party software already allows you to blank out and blur sections and the price you pay for that is a delay.    I'd much rather them use their resources to continue advancing the game I love and not wasting them on silly add-ons that don't do anything for the majority of the player base."

It is really up to the broadcaster to make it an entertaining experience. That's why popular streams tend to be giveaways. If you want to create an amazing experience for your viewers, CCP can't help you. Although, I'm sure they would love to have EVE streaming be more popular."
Eve,3e3lxa,Xercen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"Many relic sites are unguarded, so all you really need is the basics: Relic analyzer, covert ops cloak, probe launcher, and a MWD for getting around. Beyond that it's mostly what else you'd like to do, what other sites you'd want to clear, and how else you want to use your ship. There's a good amount of room for fitting to preference, but I'm sure someone will share a favorite fit or two.  As for the sites, you should be able to basically hack all of them barring the occasional unlucky break (you'll probably blow up more initially until you get better at the mini-game), and even mediocre scanning skills should be sufficient to locate most sites."
Eve,3e3lxa,someproteinguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:53 2015 UTC,I want to do relic sites. How do i find out if a relic site is guarded or not and what difficulty relic site can a loki complete?
Eve,3e3lxa,someproteinguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Sleeper sites are the only ones that come to mind as guarded off the top of my head. They're in wormholes and will have ""forgotten"" in their name somewhere when you scan them down. Barring that just warp to them cloaked and look for baddies, of course.  Clearing the sleeper sites would need a completely cap-free ship though, as they'll neut you from long range. It's a different enough challenge many people will either go grab a different ship to clear the site, or just skip them completely, as there are usually plenty of unguarded sites to found."
Eve,3e3lxa,Kukantiz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"Data/relic sites should not be an issue.  Outside of some WHs there's no rats.

Eve,3e2pph,Red_Oktoberfest,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"Because if you ruin the highest income activity for a year, it's no longer the highest attainable income, so their space becomes a fuckton more valuable in comparison?

Eve,3e2pph,Red_Oktoberfest,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:39 2015 UTC,Which still means you make less money ratting.  Which means your members are poorer.  Which means your alliance is poorer.  Not in our best interest.

Eve,3e2pph,party_face,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"Moms respawn in no more than 36 hours I believe. So to make this happen you need upwards of 40 dudes in pirate battleships, plus logi, plus they need hi sec standings. You have to move all that to a new location every 36 hours, sometimes more than 30 jumps. TVp and ISN kept popping the moms on spawn for about three weeks and even they got tired of fooling with it. If you are going to put all that effort in, you might as well just run the incursions.  As far as ganks go, getting three of your guys in as logi would be the best bet. However that is a trick you can pull about once, with those toons anyway. Keep in mind a standard freighter gank works because the freighter doesn't shoot back. These are high DPS ships with moderate tank and they are built track everything from frigates to battleships. They all carry a remote shield booster. Your best bet for a gank is to cull one from the herd, and that doesn't stop the fleet from running."
Eve,3e2pph,allmappedout,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"I am a little surprised there isn't a CODE. for incursions.

Eve,3e0bqe,CptAnthony,7,Mon Jul 20 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"Going to be a bit critical. Many of the cuts could have been a lot better timed to the song . I also found some of the film bits to be too long and that it could have been more effective to remove some of the ""dead weight"". An example of this is when the drop ship is exploding towards the end. It could have been more effective to remove some seconds on that scene so my mind would not get bored watching it (especially with the very mellow tone this song gives).   Edit: re watching for a third time I will point out that the sequence from 1:47-2:16 seems bipolar. Some scenes are dragged out way to long, others flash across your screen. Had this been timed to the transition of tone or beat to the song it would have been more powerful but I can't help think that even then all these transitions are like 2 second behind the shift in the song.   Edit 2: I guess my biggest issues revolve around the chorus more than the rest. Bar some nit picky things (I feel that you could have held the fade or black screen for the transition between 50 second and 58 second to truly utilize the false climax and transition), I think the first minute forty is actually ok its just that chorus I am having a hard time with.  Edit 3: grammar and spelling also yes, I am a bit of a transition/cut Nazi when it comes to these kind of things"
Eve,3e0bqe,JohnSelth,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:35 2015 UTC,I second what this guy says. If you are going to reuse footage you have to make sure the editing is 100% b/c its all you're bringing to the table.
Eve,3e0bqe,alwayz,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:19 2015 UTC,"I've never made a video, of any kind, before so criticism is welcome. I had a big problem timing sections and making transitions and trying my best to not make them jarring (which ended up being a bit hit or miss). I can also see how it looks eclectic. The themes I was going for was to establish the different factions vying for control (NPC and players) as well as to show the world of New Eden through all three games. The parts were pretty much introduce the factions (Capsuleer, DUSTers, Valkyries, Empires, CONCORD, and Sansha [since there's not a lot of video available for other pirates]) then throwing them altogether (fighting from all three games). But I see that because I know what I meant so someone who is not me could easily get the impression you did of a mess. :)"
Eve,3e0bqe,JohnSelth,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:03 2015 UTC,"Oh no, the faction thing was a good idea and yes, I did get the message after the third run through. But you are working with a great song for this and to not utilize its excellent transition elements makes you fall short. Don't be afraid to use the song for timing. Its literally your go to guide for transitions (particular if little to none of the used video is originally your creation) that make the viewer want to keep watching you, rather than what I just did and monolog about stuff. All in all, good start but there is def room for improvement"
Eve,3e0bqe,JohnSelth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:52 2015 UTC,I appreciate the input! I'm especially really starting to see what you mean about the 1:47-2:16 section.
Eve,3e0bqe,zehphr,4,Tue Jul 21 01:53:37 2015 UTC,"http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bCkxYFRI7RU  This is (imo) the best eve related mash up I have seen in a long time. Now while a lot of (or even the entire) video is original fraps, its use of great timing technique and a slight hint of visual effect change truelly makes it a powerful piece and one that is enjoyable. There are many others that predate this but this is the most recent that I find to be above the normal par of eve videos."

I would use the early stages of the song as a build up to an intense moment towards the end of the song.
Eve,3e0bqe,zehphr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! This is an excellent example of the technique I am talking about. This person used the progression of Lordes song to not only guide his cuts but also made it work for him by holding fades and even pausing the song to build up tension in the visuals.
Eve,3e0bqe,JohnSelth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:51:19 2015 UTC,May I add is that not only the technique is at fault here but he needs to learn on how to blend the clips to make them look like they are one instead of several uneven clips that are different size etc.

Eve,3e3awj,larowin,6,Tue Jul 21 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"I made a post about three weeks a go about something similar to your idea.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3bvxxr/idea_possible_solution_to_cyno_alts_jump_mapping/  It's an intriguing subject.  But yeah, later that night I was talking to a Cap FC bro and he explained to me that a major negative would be the ability for caps/titans/supers to jump to a system at random and then cloak up immediatly, with basically no risk to the pilot's ship. Perhaps if the ship that was jumping to no cyno couldn't cloak for a set amount of time or couldn't do certain actions, it might work though. Another possible balancing solution could be a beacon showing up to the pilots random jump location."
Eve,3e3awj,HendrinkCollie,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"Another possible balancing solution could be a beacon showing up to the pilots random jump location.   It would make sense for all sensors in the star system to pick up a 'jump portal signature' right before the ship goes through. The signature could also remain in space for some minutes after the jump, explained with tachyons and midichlorians and whatnot."
Eve,3e3awj,wartzilla,3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"I normally hate agreeing with ideas on reddit.. but if such a change were in the works, I would support the latter balance solution"
Eve,3e3awj,JohnSelth,5,Tue Jul 21 17:21:06 2015 UTC,This needs to be done simply because it would make the game more like Battlestar Galactica and that is never bad
Eve,3e3awj,wartzilla,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think phoebe jumpdrive changes were a missed opportunity to make the game more interesting. Personally I would have liked to see what they could come up with if they had focused on the cynos instead of the jumping.  Something like:  Remove cynosural field generators.  Remove the max jump range attribute from capitals.  Introduce a couple of new deployables with a set of different attributes; anchor time, LO consumption, EHP, LY broadcast range, etc.  Above deployables are anchorable between 30-100 km from any gate in low- or null. Only one can be active per constellation.  Any beacon can be jumped to by any jumpdrive ship within its broadcast range.  Covert cynos are left as is.  Ideally I would like some kind of mechanic that lets you commodify jumping around. Say I anchor one of these in a bottleneck system and made an effort to keep tacklers away from it, and in return a portion of each jump's isotopes got deposited into the structure as a tax. Or I take the isotopes and kill the poor Archon anyway because Eve is a harsh place.  Anyway, lighting a cyno is quite boring, sitting there watching it cycle. I say leave it to deployables."
Eve,3e3awj,Ravcharas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:50 2015 UTC,"A capital when jumping in creates a 'Cynosural Disturbance' which is warpable for 30 seconds to x seconds. Also if a Capital jumps in it is immobilized for y seconds (thinking 15 to 25 seconds). A capital jumps in within 1 AU of a random planet.   but what do i know, i don't fucking know shit"
Eve,3e3awj,globbyy,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Requiring a cyno allows some counter against jumping in a bunch of capitals--you can quickly kill the cyno ship after it lights and prevent the opponent from jumping in, or even catch it (e.g. in a gate camp) before it even reaches its destination.  I would be OK with a cyno-less method of jumping if, and only if,    You don't get precise control of where you land like you do with a cyno. No cyno-less jumping onto undocks or just outside a POS. Where you land should have a large amount if randomness to it. It requires a spool-up time, say 60s. At the beginning of the spool-up a beacon appears in the destination system, visible system-wide on the overview, which marks the location where you will land. If the beacon is destroyed (which should be quite easy, say 5k ehp) before the spool-up is complete, you don't get to jump in. There's a cool-down between jump attempts to prevent an invading force from just spamming jump until the defenders get overwhelmed.    To allow fleets to stay together, locations could be randomized per fleet rather than per person, and there would be just one beacon per fleet."
Eve,3e3awj,GhostOfAebeAmraen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:26 2015 UTC,Just keep cynos a things as well.  This will take care of fleets wanting to stay together.  It will also keep jump freighters from committing mass sudoku.

Eve,3dz5n6,caprisunkraftfoods,17,Mon Jul 20 22:28:41 2015 UTC,"I shit on DT here on Reddit quite a bit for the exact reasons you've pointed out. We were their neighbors and they literally went from being ""Who?"" to being the guys that brought supers and Titans into faction warfare space. Sure we have a couple carrier or dreads but what is that compared to what DT has? The helicopter dicking is pretty outrageous but who's going to do anything about it? DnG is one of the larger more active groups that was in the area but even with the allies we had in the area we wouldn't be able to match DT's t3 fleets.   Look at the fight they linked there. It's literally everyone in the warzeone (minus Ushra Khan who comes and goes) vs them and it still went bad for everyone else. And that's even DT not throwing out everything they could have so that says something about the ""gud fites"" and risk there is to them there.  I'm not saying they're doing anything wrong, they're playing with what they have and it just happens they decided to live in an area filled with Slicers and Thrashers and they brought t3s and faction battleships. It's perfectly common for them to have Feebal in a Proteus come in to light a cyno for a dozen blops to land on a t1 cruiser.  I'm not being salty or whining like a bitch, that's how they like to play and it's a sandbox. It was a great change for them and they picked the path of least resistance when they chose a home. PL isn't in Amamake and I rarely see Shadow Cartel in the area, Periphery has some caps and t3s but doesn't appear to have the numbers DT can field.  What can be done? Nothing, and I'm not next door anymore so it's not anything personal to me. It would be hilarious to see them get pushed by a group that could field the needed fleets and then watch them dock up. They love to park some shiny shit on a station and camp frigate gangs, would be quite humerous to see them do the same if someone could provide a legitimate fight."

And that's even DT not throwing out everything they could have so that says something about the ""gud fites"" and risk there is to them there.   This is the key thing to take away from this thread. As someone that was there (hi mom) there wasn't anything more that any party involved could bring, short of supers - Which were available, but we know that if we brought supers, they could still N+1 them. C'est la vie.  I enjoyed that fight a lot and it was fun content overall, but that fight isn't really what Phoebe has (or hasn't) changed. ""THE BLOB"" has just gotten more localized, and DT is a prime example of that. Pyre/MCF1B often have to fight outnumbered, as do most of the other Amarr groups that are around nowadays. We can't upscale to accomodate that because when we do, third parties step into the place of the * Legion boogeymen of old. In Heimatar/Metropolis, DT just happens to be that boogeyman. Ditto Snuff in the other warzone, and SC wherever they hang out now. With this in mind all Phoebe has done to us is make it more annoying to suitcase carrier. We can't really use our toys in combat any more than we did before without it being a guaranteed death sentence, like it would've been before. We can live with that, but this is one of the things that Phoebe supposedly improved.  A fight we had a couple of weeks ago illustrates the complete lack of fear that DT has at present. http://www.pyre-falcon.net/killboard/index.php/kill_related/28120/  We'd seen the Archons and Vindicators next door, had dreads on standby for something else already, and so we went for it. Lo and behold, the boogeyman steps out of the closet. Again, it was a fun fight, but we were utterly outmanned and outgunned after they bridged (admittedly not on top of us thanks to range reduction). I like the Phoebe changes overall, but there's always a bigger fish; the minimum fish-size has reduced somewhat, but since the old addage of ""If you can't beat them, join them"" rings true in all arenas of Eve, some fish grow alarmingly quickly."
Eve,3dz5n6,Blexie,2,Tue Jul 21 09:47:07 2015 UTC,"That link you provided is another example of the same. Literally as much firepower as possible and not a drop in the bucket for them.   They also have their new feeder corp, or sidekicks, bunk mates, whatever you want to call the group that replaced Already Disbanded.   Literally the ""if you can't beat them join them"" meta applies because I've seen pilots hate DT as much as the rest of the war zone join up and talk about all the great fights they're getting. They're not great fights, they're just on the other side of the fight, being the guy they were just bitching about."

I was in TISHU the first couple months after the jump change and it really fucked the whole ecosystem. The PL boogeyman was never as real for entities like that as people made it out to be it seemed to me.  While it made them dominate over areas and able to use supers/titans in almost any situation. The smaller Synidicate groups either died or  left instead of fighting the supers ect.. of the low sec power  blocs..  Essentially I feel Pheobe has been a disaster for big ls/npc groups like those.
Eve,3dz5n6,Extender_Myths,9,Mon Jul 20 22:05:16 2015 UTC,It's only been a disaster for those that didn't adapt.

There were plenty of other shorter lived coalitions as well who formed as either defensive pacts or for campaign purposes.  Lowsec is much better for capital engagements post-phoebe, and you could get the dreads out for a tower bash with a little less concern.  That said, as an Alliance that has now moved to Nullsec capitals were a ballache to even consider moving. The changes have definitely brought some refreshment but I think the suggestion to have drug-type side-effects as a replacement for jump initiation timer works as a deterrent but doesn't render the suitcase function of capitals useless."

The fact that there are now quite a few competing in groups, rather than a tiny number, and that those groups are regional rather than universal changes the equation entirely.  To begin with, an ambitious lowsec group might aim to build up to be able to challenge one of those regional groups.

Eve,3dz5n6,meowtiger,3,Tue Jul 21 02:44:36 2015 UTC,This was happening before these changes.  what is better is that there is actually room for lowsec groups to live instead of lowsec being where null alloances go to die.

So you linked a fight where you clearly had the advantage and call it as an example as a thing that is ""good for Eve"". No this was good for you.  Sorry, I don't see where lowsec/FW space, a place where we may want to encourage casual and newbie players, to play, becomes better when alliances can field faction BSes and caps unchecked. Instead you become your own regional 'PL', dominates the field, and hunts of weaker. Not convinced this is better for Eve."
Eve,3dz5n6,xchadrickx,8,Mon Jul 20 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in another comment in this thread that's exactly what that link was. It's extremely rare, and it's literally the entire warzone and all the pilots they could get vs DT, while DT didn't even have to go balls in. It's nothing for them to have Titans and supers logged in or drop a dozen blops on a couple cruisers because who's going to do anythign about it?  DT does their thing, they enjoy it obviously. They intentionally set themselves up to be the tough guys of the area by choosing an active faction warfare zone full of dudes in frigates (cruisers if they escalate) and they can field t3s and caps. You get used to it and just tag thier out of alliance cynos, use intel to duck them when you can."
Eve,3dz5n6,strangepostinghabits,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"of course his ego will tell him that he should post a fight that goes well.  But check the ships involved. 5-6 caps on each side, then stacks of subcaps...  this is an interesting scale to have fights on.  the ability to field caps without escalating to batphone epeen measuring competitions is precisely what the jump changes wanted to set up."
Eve,3dz5n6,EpikurusFW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"The guys now at the top of the regional food chain are much smaller and more challengeable than the guys at the top of the universal food chain.  In any situation, some people are going to be dunked by the strongest guys around but it is definitely better for the game for there to be many smaller strong guys than just one or two who dominate everything.  Challengers don't have to climb so high and we end up with much more variation and colour.  That said, smaller groups are also using caps much more frequently now than they were before because anything out of single jump range of the apex groups' homes are now much safer than before (although still not safe)."

Eve,3dz5n6,capeus,15,Tue Jul 21 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"It is nice in the way it forces you to have capitals staged in the area/region you want to use them in, or spend a long time travelling there.  So effectively it has removed immediate force projection of large capital and super capital blobs from the game, which in my opinion is a good thing.  It allows groups in both lowsec, npc null and sov null to use their capital assets more assertively without the knowledge that any cap tackled for more than 10 minutes will die to an immediate projection of PL supers across the universe.  As a result of that, I see more fights happen with ships of the brawling variety (BS supported by Triage for example) instead of only long range kiting fleets that disengage after a few losses."
Eve,3dz5n6,Extender_Myths,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:55 2015 UTC,"Funny, I remember tons of faction BS + triage being used by LS groups pre pheobe. Don't ever recall PL coming to any of the ones I was on to fuck them up."

Generally speaking, if you want moons or to fly large amounts of bling you need to be prepared to deal with hostile capitals.   If you're more I to smaller scale stuff, the existence of the nerds sitting in a titan don't impact you in the least.   Overall, I've seen caps deployed and lost a lot more in FW space now and the important thing is that they are being fielded by the dudes actually in the fight instead of each side needing to try and find their own bat phone for support."

You are out of money, and you are forced to stop offering the product.   Maybe you're fine with that. I don't know. But it's what you're suggesting people do, on the grounds of makig the game more ""hardcore"" and ""authentic""."

BL hasn't actually accepted a mercenary contract since working the CFC during the Halloween war.  Power projection was about being able to live anywhere, but have a sizeable fleet somewhere else very fast. Power Projection was living in Lonetrek, and being able to scout titan a tengu fleet and 30 dreads to the middle of Fountain in 20 minutes. Being able to redeploy your alliance without your members spending 10hrs moving their caps is not force projection.

Eve,3dz5n6,knobber_jobbler,8,Mon Jul 20 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't stop anyone doing a long term deployment, it just made it tedious to do so.   Perhaps for the biggest blocs, but for almost everyone else conflict has become a lot more regional, which was kinda sorta CCPs exact stated design goal.   Your whole argument is based around going 'on deployment', which is a shit gameplay concept to begin with. Coalitions have to deploy to get fights have fun grinding moons elsewhere because they're blue to all their neighbors, which is the big issue that CCP is currently grappling with. The whole point is to live in your space and get content from it, an idea that breaks down when the most conflict you have with your neighbors is some local smack about who gets to run an anom.  Everyone else is 'deployed' to where they live."

As an example it took us 4 fucking days with like 3 hour moveops each day to cross the fucking map.  And the problem here is, that many old players are just staying behind because they just dont want to spend that much time to do shit...

I would also look at what you're producing. Ships aren't often where the real money is at. Check out consumables and modules.  Still, you can probably buy those things from a market hub cheaper than you could personally produce them, then sell them in your mission hub for profit (especially if you utilize buy orders on a market alt).

Always factor how you are going to get the minerals you need and how you are going to get the goods to market when deciding where to set up shop.

Eve,3e2cgi,trekkie1701c,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm voting more for a Freespace kick.  Recently CCP released the Hecate-class destroyer, which, lore-wise, makes use of reverse-engineered sleeper technology pretty heavily.  In Freespace 2, you're introduced to the brand new Hecate-class destroyer; which although it's not explicitly stated, it's implied based on lore that it's designed to make better use of reverse-engineered Shivan technology (with some aspects of the Shivan storyline not being too dissimilar from what's happening with the Sleeper/Drifters right not - to the point where a few months ago I'd actually joked that Caroline's star was just the aftermath of the Shivan Supercap fleet doing it's thing - which is exploding Stars, apparently).  Of course this is all in the second game.  In the first game where humanity initially makes contact with the Shivans, the player is based off of another destroyer - the Galatea; which serves as the player's home until it's violently exploded by the Shivans during the Battle for Deneb (which later results in them reducing the surface of the planet there to ash, before moving on to Vasuda Prime and doing the same thing unopposed, as the defensive line was in Deneb and got obliterated).  Given that CCP isn't beyond exploding planets - or stars - who knows if it could be a reference to bigger things coming.  Or they could just be making a reference to an old game they like (which is noted in the Second Decade collector's edition book)"

Eve,3dww1y,jD_Aerendir,22,Mon Jul 20 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"I love your videos! ^ Thanks for recording and sharing.  I could say a lot of good things, but I think you've heard it all already by pilots far more experienced than myself anyhow, so I'll write some criticism if that's ok, but not about your piloting, about your editing, which is something I know a lot about from exp.  The red color you use for the stuff you killed, and for the negative booster effects, is almost not visible. In your editing software preview I'm sure it looks great, but watch it in youtube fullscreen at 720 and see how you can just vaguely see anything in that color.  The text you're using is problematic in some ways. The information is of course great! But the speed of the text is too high. It is impossible to follow the fight while reading the ever changing comments you're writing. And while I assure you that many people enjoy your vids, I can also assure you that very few pause and read everything you're writing. A good few quality players do I'm sure- probably the same few who take a moment to comment or write something here in reddit, but the other 95% don't pause and just miss most of your text.  Also it's hard to notice when you switched the text. I kept finding myself looking to the bottom right with my eyes only to be surprised that the text already changed and I didn't start reading it yet, therefore I have to pause once again because who knows how many seconds I have left to read it.  The solution to both these issues, as a video editor, is the same one. Less text and more empty space in between. Between texts there should be a few seconds of no text at all, then when a new batch of text arrives your eyes immediately go there. While the switch between text to text is almost invisible to the eye, the switch between nothing and text will immediately catch the eyes of the viewer, and then we have more time to read it also because we catch it from the get go. And less text means using your words more wisely, summarizing, pilots will get your point.  I love your text, it is great as is right now, perfect. But I just wonder if you understand that 90%+ probably don't get to read it. People go watch a fun video and they'll give it one go, probably stop at some point without finishing it ether (look at your average time played in youtube video stats). So which %s are you looking to enrich with all that text information? The 5% people that are really into PvP and read everything you write, or the 95something% people that watch it, and may get into PvP or even into Eve by watching it? I think you should find a balance and that means less text and more breaks between it. That's my opinion.  Your videos are great and I enjoy them very much, and you are a great player!"
Eve,3dww1y,lord-carlos,12,Mon Jul 20 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for taking the time to write this out. I'm always trying to improve my editing, which I am quite a noob at tbh, and I appreciate your perspective on what I'm doing wrong.  I could try for a brighter shade of red on the kill box, and I tried changing the text box transitions by adding crossfade but I'll try for sharp breaks.  Honestly for the people looking to get the most out of the video, it's going to require some level of watching again or pausing regardless if I keep the same level of information. I am planning to start releasing non-music voice commentary versions in parallel with the regular release but I was a bit short on time this weekend so I had to hold off on it this time.  Thanks again.  -Mr Hyde"

Eve,3dww1y,Xorondras,3,Mon Jul 20 14:44:08 2015 UTC,"A golden rule for typos is to use 2 colors. For instance Black Fill with white border or vice versa.

Eve,3dww1y,fear2trust,3,Mon Jul 20 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"For some technical reasons, the compression that youtube (and other sites: h264) uses can't compress red that well. At least in most cases.

Eve,3dww1y,simonmaz,4,Mon Jul 20 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you're using red text in any video it needs to have an outline of some other color to give it any chance to survive compression well, and even then red is not a good text color for youtube period."

Eve,3dy6vp,Niden_GMVA,7,Mon Jul 20 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"This is one area of the game that I don't think the lore explores very well (correct me if there's a chronicle I'm missing).  Which is funny because it neatly explains the very perplexing and illogical actions of the capsuleer elite.  Thanks Tarek for putting this into words much better than I could.  Another thing I've not seen explored is the idea of capsuleers truly considering themselves Gods.  I see a lot of parallels between New Eden and the Greek pantheon.  The Greeks saw their Gods as largely disinterested in the affairs of humans.  Their realm was of primary concern, and mortals were just a sometimes interesting but largely irrelevant addition to the world they inhabited.  The Gods would even start wars for their own amusement or for childish reasons, not worrying too much about the deaths these actions caused.  What must it be like to be a mortal who has just signed on to a capsuleer's crew?  A being of immeasurable wealth and power has given you a fortune to man one of their uncountable ships.  In exchange, he could end your life for no other reason than his own amusement.  Given this I'm amazed I haven't heard of a group of mortals who worship capsuleers exclusively (again, show me the lore if this exits!).  Given my limited understanding of the Greek mythos (college was a while ago) I see a lot of potential for interesting lore here."
Eve,3dy6vp,_Milodon_,6,Mon Jul 20 22:06:28 2015 UTC,There are two chronicles I believe that cover baseliner-capsuleer interactions and views of each other and how capsuleers view those without their own immortality All these lives are fit to ruin deals with how a capusleer reacts when one of the mortal crew sabotages his vessel causing it to explode mid-fight. Xenocracy deals with Planetery Interaction where a capsuleer demolishes a entire inhabited city because he wants to extract common metals.

Eve,3dy6vp,Kantastic,2,Tue Jul 21 08:03:36 2015 UTC,"There are certainly parallels between the EVE canon and Greek mythology. The capsuleers-as-demigods aspect certainly plays a strong role and there sure would be enough powerhungry squabbling megalomaniacs in EVE to fill a Pantheon with capricious gods.  I am also not aware of any lore dealing specifically with worship of capsuleers, but I can certainly imagine it. If not worship in the form of a divinity then definitely a cult following of sorts. People who are fascinated and enthralled by a capsuleer personality in the way how humans often devote themselves to larger-than-life personalities. In some extreme cases they might indeed be prepared and willing to die gloriously as a crewman of the capsuleer. Like the warboys in the latest MadMax movie."
Eve,3dy6vp,TheKamar,12,Mon Jul 20 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"It’s not like EVE makes an effort to guilt-trip people with the tragedy of the thousands who die in a stupid fleet welps.

Eve,3dy6vp,TastyGhost,4,Mon Jul 20 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"The question of what defines identity is nearly as old as philosophical discussion itself.  One of the most recognized thought experiments is the Ship of Theseus, as described by Plutarch.  Essentially, if the ship of Theseus has its boards replaced over time (damages, wear, etc...), at what point is it no longer Theseus's ship and instead something different?  Hobbes later built on this further by asking; if someone were to follow after the original ship as it discards its old boards, and then were to fashion a ship identical to the first out of the remains, which ship then holds the identity, the ship that carries the name or the ship formed from the body?  Contextually, the ability to jump between clones clearly supports the assumption that identity as a concept follows something different than the physical form as its representative.  However, given both the suggested requirement for storage on a computer and, presumably, the ability to duplicate data, whats to stop a capsuleer (or the individuals directing the transfer) from activating multiple clones at once, and who then would assume the capsuleer identity?"

Clones are free now!"
Eve,3dy6vp,TheKamar,6,Mon Jul 20 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how much the player experience matches the imaginary capsuleer experience. A player doesn't care if they lose a whole fleet of ships, because it's just a game. A capsuleer doesn't care because ships, crews, even their body, is expendable, and they have eternity to recover from that lose.  A lot of the more whimsical/psychopathic behaviour in game makes sense as the behaviour of an immortal being just looking for entertainment."

You might enjoy this SUPER AWESOME small indy RPG called ECLIPSE PHASE if you like that kind of Sci-Lore dealing with Transhumanism, which is part of the EVE Lore by itself with Capsuleer Technology  Here´s the Amazon link for the Core which alone makes it worth it.   The story deals with the same topic, in the future humans have the ability to transfer conciousness into new bodies, creating ""castes"" of people beyond gender/religious/social boundaries usually accepted.  People that live only in combat bodies working as mercs, others that live bodiless in Virtual world, others that can only afford clunky amorphous bodies to do menial tasks in outer space installations, and the elite that get top of the line bodies and variations thereof.  Also in the past, AI gained levels of exponential intelligence that made it focus on one goal, harvest all of Humanity´s HEADS, abduct said heads and then open Riftholes in the outer edges of the Solar System that led to places far beyond and deep in the Universe, going with like 3/4 of the total Earth populations HEADS scooped away for who knows what horrific purposes into the deepest bowels of the known (and unknown) Universe via these Gateways, never to return.  So humanity is being slowly rebuilt after the headgrabbin´decapitation apocalypse brought by the AI and now we are left with few organic bodies, and even fewer bodies to inhabit and huge Gateways to the Unknown built by the AI machines that lead to Random Places in the Universe, as the same time there´s a resistance movement to the status quo that wants humanity to improve faster, plus Earth is still a no-go forbidden zone filled with decapitating robots intent on stealing your HEAD.  Add to this our Solar System filled with remote stations each practically a City State with its own customs, quirks and social norms, there´s even a station filled with a single conciousness that in an act of vanity filled the whole station with copies of his mind, so its inhabited by the same person each living a different existence from the other!

Eve,3dyzxy,PM_ME_YOUR_AWOX,11,Mon Jul 20 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like I should expand on this. The Huginn and Rapier have longer range webs and so are useful for nano gangs who like to kite and control range. The loki has smaller bonus to web range but significantly more tank.   Personally I think the Stratios should be your ship of choice. You'd want to fit it according to the task but it can be a good exploration ship, can be tank armour for brawling or shield fit for nano gangs. It also has a larger then average cargo for all your loot, extra fittings and mobile depot.  The only advantage that a loki would have is its ability its interdiction nullification when exploring. Though the Stratios will have more damage while maintaining its cov ops cloak."

Eve,3dyzxy,icantcs,4,Tue Jul 21 07:26:01 2015 UTC,Any T3 can do exploration just fine.   I know quite a few used the loki to web in c5 sites so dreads can hit the sleepers. I haven't done any PvE with a loki though but I assume it could do C3 sites solo though maybe not as efficiently as others.  For what you're looking for I think either work just as well. If you're going to be doing more on the PvE side of things I'd go with a Tengu though.
Eve,3dyzxy,Archaya,8,Mon Jul 20 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"All T3's can do explo, but there one singular T3 that is supremely qualified for it.  I keep yapping about it on /r/fittings every time it comes up, but the Proteus with the ability to field 6 lows and a 100m3/25mbit drone service while fully explofit, the only T3 that can do that, makes it for me THE explo vessel.   There is nothing like a sub 4 second warping, quad stabbed, covopsed Proteus that can also push out ECM drones and still have 25k ehp travelfit at the end of the day. The fact that you can also push out a full flight of lights aside from any petty guns you might have on it helps immensely to boss around Asteros that want to do your site and don't take the hint. Also, the maxlows come in use as well when ultra-tanking Superior Sleeper caches. Dual 1600mm plates, dual EANMs and a faction rep and you can tank for days, as well as survive any shitty AI logic fuckups that might happen in the turret room. The only thing one might feel sad about is that in explofit you have just three mids and petty cargo space. You can drop the data analyzer for the cargo scanner but it is a tossup.  Even if you consider Stratioses and Nestors as well as other T3s and T2 covops frigs, the Proteus is /the/ gold standard in top-level explo. I just really hope it doesn't get kicked in the nuts when the T3 rebalance comes arounds."
Eve,3dyzxy,cosmitz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"The nestor would be absolutely useless for exploration as it cannot fit a cov-ops cloak.

Eve,3dyzxy,Sky_Hound,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"I've had success refitting to a sentry proteus with just one subsystem change. Did its job but i disliked the vulnerability of it when i might as well just switched to a 400mil cheaper ship to do the same thing.

You are the first i have seen with such a stellar review of its exploration capabilities. I generally use either an Astero or Stratios(if i find a standard sleeper cache). Would love some input from an experienced T3 pilot. I just found your recommended fit for the superior cache. Are you using a 3% PG implant? Thanks"

I'd rather trust my flight of faction Warriors to do the damage if it comes to it.   The basic fit is simple enough, quadstab, twin inertial stab for the lows, relic/data/mwd mids, cloak/probe/railguns. Subs aside from the locus/emergent/interdiction can't remember right now, but only one from engineering gives you extra drone bay, and the other is the one that gives max lows.

Basic Explo, with commentary:   In Exploratione Veritas - Explo Proteus     Inertial Stabilizers II   Inertial Stabilizers II   Warp Core Stabilizer II   Warp Core Stabilizer II  Warp Core Stabilizer II  Warp Core Stabilizer II   What to get from this: Can make you safe from two scrams or a faction scram and a point, it's rare to meet someone that's got more, or to get /that/ horribly pointed after being unluckily randomly decloaked on a gate when you got a 4 second align time anyway.     Relic Analyzer II  Data Analyzer II  500MN Y-T8 Compact Microwarpdrive   This is all you can carry in your mids, no cherry picking unless you drop the Data. Why the 500MN? Since i can fit it wonderfully in the fit with some minor PG implants/genos.     Dual 150mm Railgun II, Spike M  Dual 150mm Railgun II, Spike M  Dual 150mm Railgun II, Spike M  Dual 150mm Railgun II, Spike M  Sisters Expanded Probe Launcher  Covert Ops Cloaking Device II   Guns are mostly for show but they do put out 100 DPS at 40km. Enough to say 'shoo' to someone in a relic that doesn't want to go and scare them half to death. Expanded Probe Launcher since i also do some Combat Probing once in a while. Not for scouting per se, but for a defensive 'where the fuck is this guy', or to scare people away. They see Proteus, they don't know what you are, but with Combat Probes on dscan, they often don't try their chances.     Medium Memetic Algorithm Bank I  Medium Anti-Explosive Pump II  Medium Anti-Explosive Pump II   The Memetic Algorithm Bank might seem like a weird choice but consider that the nastiest and most dangerous hacks you'll ever do in this game are actual Hacking, not Archeology/Relics. Talking about Superior Sleeper Sites. Feel free to put a Gravity Rig if you wish.      Proteus Electronics - Emergent Locus Analyzer  Proteus Defensive - Augmented Plating  Proteus Engineering - Augmented Capacitor Reservoir  Proteus Offensive - Covert Reconfiguration  Proteus Propulsion - Interdiction Nullifier   Locus/Covert/Interdiction need no mention. Augmented Capacitor Reservoir is the one that gives you 100m3 drones and 25mbit, and the Augmented Plating gives you the +2 lows and outright increases your armor hitpoints. This is important when tanking the hell out of it for Superiors.     Republic Fleet Warrior x5  Vespa EC-600 x2   Vespas for GTFO and Republic Fleet Warriors for general dakka. Overall can push out just shy of 200 DPS with the guns on Spike. So 200 DPS applied at 40km out.       For Superior Sleeper Caches the following happens to the fit:    Offline the guns. Replace the 500MN with a 50MN. Replace all the lows with the following: Damage Control II, 2x 1600mm Steel Plates II, 2x Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II and however much you want to spend on a Medium Armor Repairer, i went with the Centum C-Type Medium Armor Repairer.    This gives me ~115k EHP versus the turret room, or around 130k EHP omni. More than enough.       For Covert Ops Research Facilities/Ghost Sites, it's enough for me to do this:    Damage Control Unit II and an Explosive Armor Hardener II, keeping the rest of the 4 lows with Warp Core Stabilizers. Generally i get out when the cruisers come in, but i want to make sure if they land a scram i get out. Apparently with enough tank you can push through their DPS and they'll go away, but haven't tested that out for obvious reasons."

Eve,3dyzxy,mrcrazy_monkey,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:38 2015 UTC,Loki makes a great support ship because of its web bonus. Its more useful than a Huigin in most situations because of its heavier tank.
Eve,3dyzxy,kaybee915,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"Not great for exploration. If by minor wh pve you mean c5/6 cap escalations then yes, otherwise its pretty bad at pve. Wouldn't use as a solo pvp ship. Could be useful with small gangs but there are better options."
Eve,3dyzxy,Rokos,3,Mon Jul 20 18:17:32 2015 UTC,"For PVE purposes, the Tengu is going to be a good bet, but I prefer the Loki for PVP purposes. It all comes down to preference and what exactly you're going to use it for. Eventually you'll probably train all of them anyway."

Eve,3dyzxy,theelous3,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Loki's are crazy fucking monsters with webs, good dps, increidible dps application and selectable damage types. Brawling with ac's is fantastic, and kiting with arty is fantastic. With dual webs even a 1600 plate arty loki can kite and obliterate almost anything.  Cloaky loki is also arguably the best t3 cloaky for ganking pve ships and smaller stuff thanks to damage types, though the prot will out dps it on most non-kin/therm native resist ships.  It's my favourite t3, along side ham legion.  Not great for pve though."
Eve,3dyzxy,Valentine009,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"Do they have good DPS though? As someone that can fly loki, tengu and legion I always found the loki a very wet tissur"
Eve,3dyzxy,theelous3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"Ham legion does 627 dps, loki does 623 (faction ammo for both.)  Hot with hail the loki pushes 770 dps which is perfect for killing other brawl ships, what with armor things having explo holes usually. You'll find if you investigate the numbers a bit, that a loki will do more real world dps than a crazy dps proteus, simply because of the prevalence of ships with good base kin/therm resists. (Nearly all caldari and gal t2 / t3 ships.)  Then you'll find that with something like killing a proteus, or sacrilege or other armour based t2 / t3 ship, that their resist hole is actually EM rather than explo because their hole is plugged, and you can easily do full dps with EMP whilst a tengu, laser legion, or prot is locked in damage type. All of a sudden you're killing 1.5b 1000dps prots with your superior range control and damage types, even though on paper they have better dps, sometimes projection, and tank.  Hell, I fought that dudes officer fit moracha in my arty loki and it was a stalemate. No other t3 could've done that.  To summarise, what you have is a t3 that is AMAZING at killing kiters thanks to dual million km webs, amazing at brawling because it can range control blaster ships, kill the drones of drone boats quickly, and disengage quite well if needs be.   You can also fucking annihilate frig gangs and are not cap dependant, which is awesome."
Eve,3dyzxy,kloden112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:50 2015 UTC,Do you have a good loki fit without needing logi?
Eve,3dyzxy,theelous3,3,Tue Jul 21 10:10:28 2015 UTC,"Sure. Something like this will work from small gang / solo all the way up to the biggest wh brawls.  This is my favourite arty fit. Requires AWU V, an eg-604 and genoes 1+2. Definitly only fly that thing if you know it's going to be just you vs cruisers and bigger, or you have a SOLID AS FUCK couple of guys in svipuls or whatever screening tackle. If you're on your own and a frig grabs hold of you, you're so fucking dead. Have a depot with a couple'a stabs + mobile mjd just in case.  This one just devours frigs and other solo cruisers, as long as you're comfortable with the low dps. Concurrence reg. subsystem gives you sick tracking.  If you want to live on the bleeding edge, try this one. Expensive, fast, and it's only tank is a damage control + two rigs. It's very much just a far scarier arty cynabal, though a tad slower and less agile. Absolutely requires links + snakes of some kind.  Add links as you like, though they are needed for the last fit. All but the last benefit greatly from slaves. The loki has stunning resists but not the highest base armor to apply those resists too. The loki's survivability is second only to the legion if logi is around, and slaves help that quite a bit. With the prot and tengu you have resist holes absolutely everywhere. Em, explo, back to em again. Yuck."
Eve,3dyzxy,kloden112,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you good sir. I specially like the dual rep one, its what im looking for :). Gonna try one out :) i know the projection of ac's is not what it once was, but how do you think it is in actual combat?"
Eve,3dyzxy,theelous3,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"It's great, it really is. You don't think it's great until things start dying rapidly all around you - your small shots not doing much damage each but cycling like a motherfucker. What's fun about the standard plated 220mm autocannon one I linked, is that with barrage loaded you can kite and kill pulse legions even though their dps is twice yours at 20km. The confusion that sets in as your em resists go to work and your dps trickles them down is priceless.  I hope you have fun flying many lokis!"

Eve,3dyzxy,TzuWu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it can, I just see a lot more Tengu boosts in fleets."
Eve,3dyzxy,lolredditor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"That's because more people have a tengu laying around from PVE and slippery petes.  Way easier to get a hold of tengu boosts than loki, and there isn't a big enough difference to push for the loki."
Eve,3dyzxy,PixelBoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the Loki, as you can indeed make it virtually unscannable. The only way you can scan one down is with at least 4 out of 6 mid grade virtues. Not many people use those implants in null, so you have to worry VERY little about your booster getting caught while you're worrying about expensive Orthrus."
Eve,3dyzxy,TzuWu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"Nice, maybe I'll look at picking up a Loki for boosting some fleets in the future."

That's with a rep fleet mindlink btw. It doesn't give as many boosts as the Tengu can, but it gives the important ones for kiting fleets: Point range bonus, Shield resist bonus, and sig radius bonus (makes you harder to hit)."

Eve,3dyzxy,cheerfulwish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:41 2015 UTC,No reason to use a 4 link Link when you can use a 5 link Tengu.   Tengu is a better shield booster than Loki without a doubt
Eve,3dyzxy,PixelBoom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"Lokis are good for a lot of stuff. personally, I've used a loki for:   ratting for Sansha 8/10 and 9/10 (dat em/therm resist) sleeper capital escalations (also ratting) solo cloaky ganking AHAC fleet webbing ship webbing ship for incursions instalock gate camping BLOPS hunter   Just a few examples.

I tend to go after people ratting in Sansha or Blood raider space, as they are most likely going to be doing EM/THEM damage and you're cloaky loki can pump out about 500 DPS in EXP and KIN."
Eve,3dyzxy,Dorfidiot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:57 2015 UTC,Webs. Insane Sansha resistances but otherwise a bad ratting ship.
Eve,3dyzxy,lolredditor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"You really want it though for the web bonus.  Projectiles aren't that bad.  The difference is mainly on paper, and the instances where projectiles don't work are specific ones involving drone boat combat.  They work fine for all the purposes you listed.  Tengu does as well, though it's a bit better at PvE damage but has less utility."
Eve,3dyzxy,Kirk-ernaga,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"The Loki has a few areas where it really shines Unfortunately it's not as good for pve as a tengu, except as previously mentioned in wormholes. It also has less raw dps then a tengu. However I would argue that in most pvp situations a Loki is better as it has a damn sexy resist profile and Better dps application. It's a little faster so that always helps. Also where the tengu can use jams the Loki has smexy webs."

Eve,3dyzxy,HendrinkCollie,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:00 2015 UTC,"How I would grade it (I fly lokis a fair bit):  exploration (A) - great ship, has plenty of mids to fit all the needed modules + still have more than enough tank for sleeper sites caches; never not cloaky nullify exploration  wh PvE (D) - not really, the arty loki has bad DPS, while the AC loki will put you into neut range. Will work, but there are better options (even certain T2 ships would work better). Web lokis can be useful for high-end sleeper sites though...  lowsec solo PVP (B) - Would work pretty well, especially if you are patient for targets. Web arty fit works wonders since you will have superior range control to most ships you will 1 v 1. You HAVE to keep range though.. i mean, you COULD do a brawling AC loki I guess, but against another T3, you will likely be outclassed.  lowsec/null gangs (lowsec B+ / nullsec C-) - a gate camping quick-lock loki is amazing, almost as fast as an inty, but with the tank to hold up to gate guns; web lokis are also useful... makes arty platforms usable; wouldn't recommend some null gangs unless you really know what you doing because speed meta is going to bite you in the ass (lokis are fairly slow)"

Eve,3dyzmb,desertpolarbear,5,Mon Jul 20 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"Predictions:   This is not for players.  This is for Amarr lore NPC stuff. The ship will not make it through it's first fight.  Drifters will obliterate it. The ship is a remake of the original one seen in Empyrean Age trailer. I believe we might see a reappearance of the Elders, and potentially a new Elder Fleet (though I don't have much to back this up)   The reasoning behind the strong cap and tank is because this beam was previously powered by Isogen 5 (no not our corp).  For those that don't know much lore, I believe that a cache of isogen 5 was shot and exploded by Thukker Tribe members.  However, apparently the cache was also somehow ""magically"" (not sure the explanation here) tied to other cache's throughout New Eden.  These intertwined isogen 5 particles all exploded creating many of the shattered planets in k-space.  Some people have theorized the shattered wormholes and Caroline's Star are a direct result of the destruction of more isogen 5.  If the drifters are in fact evolved Jovians, they still have a bone to pick with the Amarrian's, and this is a great way to do it.  As for the timing of everything, destroying the fuel for the potential killing weapon of the Amarr (maybe fueling their own mini-DD's in the process?) made the Drifters confident enough to begin revealing themselves.  Additionally, with this theory suggesting the Jove are highly anti-Amarr, I believe they may have wanted to give other groups an opportunity to harass the Amarrians as well (Sansha using wormholes generated by drifters).  As of late, it appears the Sansha have had several serious disagreements with the drifters though.  These are evident in the wreckage strewn about some of the new systems.  With a drifter return, they may feel it's unnecessary to continue supplying the Sansha with as many wormholes as they used to, and they may begin using these wormholes more heavily themselves.  This may lead to eventually drifter incursions, but from a gut feeling I'm hesitant to believe drifter incursions will ever be a thing.  This explains much of the on-goings of late in New Eden, but the one thing I haven't figured out yet is why the Jovian towers have been destroyed, who destroyed them, or how they discovered and destroyed them.  The best I can come up with, is that these towers were near indestructible, and also fueled by small amounts of isogen 5.  The destruction of cache's elsewhere deep in J-space tied back to the one's fueling towers in k-space.  This would explain why all towers became visible at once, how the towers were destroyed, and why the holes on the tower appear to be blown outwards from the center.  What it does not explain, is why the towers weren't decloaked and destroyed when Caroline's star was first spotted.  Perhaps there's some sort of delay due to the huge distance between k-space and j-space?  I can't wait to see what CCP has in store for us.  Edit: Looks like I at least got my first bullet point right so far!"

Eve,3e1h6x,ShirraliaEVE,0,Tue Jul 21 17:03:34 2015 UTC,It can be very hit and miss. Sometimes you get 5 sites in a session and none of them have any real loot. Then you find one site the next day and that one drops 700m in loot (this is obviously from higher-end sites).

The problem is that the events that mattered attracted a ton of people who wanted to third party. They wanted to be a part of Eve history. Fights that really should have been 2k pilots were 4k, because 2k people were trying to get in on the action because they wanted to ""be there"".  Now, I don't particularly enjoy tidi fights where the tidi breaks (sub-10%). But, the flip side is that I do enjoy fights mattering. I think we went way too far the other way, tidi isn't happening because there isn't a hell of a lot of history happening. I don't know how it happens now, since I don't think there's a competent alliance that wants to put together a coalition and blue itself for long enough to build up resources.

TiDi gets bad there too sometimes but generally not to the point where you want to kill yourself irl ingame.

Now a big fight lasts a lot longer than 3 minutes.  Home field advantage allows to reship and get back into the fight.  It allows nearby allies to come help if there isn't a really skilled dictor slowing them down.  Ill take 2015 Tidi over 2005 blackscreen anyday.

During B-R it was mostly titans dying not supers. The brick ones would proabably tank another DD or 2 than a Nyx/Hel.

Eve,3dyr0o,Guplup,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"Super carriers were just random casualties in B-R, all the dank dunks were on the titans.  You were most likely to survive in a nano hel, getting away from this mess AT FULL SPEED CAPTAIN' to cloak/jump. But I don't think that was what you had in mind...

Eve,3dyr0o,Reppyk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:52 2015 UTC,I think the winning move for B-R was to not jump in the first place (for both sides)
Eve,3dyr0o,Theon_Severasse,3,Mon Jul 20 18:00:28 2015 UTC,Since noone mentioned i'd add another difference: size of drone bay where nyx and hel has an advantage over aeon and wyvern. This difference means either 2 spare Fbs (5 fighters) or makes DCU a good choice for highslot fitting.

Eve,3dyr0o,PM_ME_YOUR_AWOX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"First: Decide between shield or armor supercaps. Armor has Utility meds but has to sacrifice tank for damage. Shield has no/not that many Utility meds but can switch to damage without losing that much tank (6-7mio ehp on a wyvern). Armor supers are always slaved while shield supers can run Talisman sets to get a significant Cap Bonus. All fits are with Levi/Erebus Bous. In case I tell you bullshit, correct me (but I'm still full of hate for the Hel, sorry guys), I'll change it asap  Supers were the force multipliers in Dominion sov and are by now useless in fozzie sov. Right now... well, you can make a gatecamp with it....  Aeon   Armor tanked, Bonus for Armor reps, cap Transfer range and Armor Resistances. Since you are in SMA: Get this one if you like remote reps and Cap Buddys than can cap you from 58km Shitload of ehp, 61mio ehp cold, 84mio hot also losing tank when being in travel fit (Hyperspatials and Inertia stabs)   Nyx   The damage Monster. Good for high end ratting Shit cap Transfer range. In case you have a Wyvern/Aeon and you get a Nyx as a cap buddy... well, fuck Less tank compared with the other armor super, the Aeon Dont get a Nyx. We know it looks better compared with the Aeon but you are nothing more than a meatshield in B-R 2.0 once your side runs out of Titans and out of Hels.   Wyvern   CALDARI SUPREMACY  shieldfleet (thats enough, honestly) it's an Aeon just shieldtanked, more cap (thanks to the Talsiman set!), MORE TANK. 55mio ehp cold BUT 110mio EHP HOT (Oh in case you drop your MWD for another Invul it's 60/120mio ehp). FUCK YEAH WYVERN!   Hel   cool for roleplayers. Minmatar stuff you know? Well, until these poor Minmatar scrubs met a group of Aeons. RIP Hels Dont get a Hel. Only reason to get one is to hotdrop ratting carriers in the dronelands, that's it EDIT: It has a cool skin. Might be a reason for you"
Eve,3dyr0o,Justanothershitpostr,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:27 2015 UTC,Aeon has the largest armor tank whilst the Nyx has a higher DPS afaik.
Eve,3dyr0o,jD_Aerendir,5,Mon Jul 20 17:01:45 2015 UTC,Iirc without implants the wyvern gets a better tank
Eve,3dyr0o,Your-Neighbor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"Isn't armor tanking far more used ? That means more ""chances"" to have an Erebus on field. I'm not very familiar with nullsec powerblocks so correct me if I'm wrong."
Eve,3dyr0o,jD_Aerendir,4,Mon Jul 20 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, shield is technically better, but everyone relevant uses armor supers primarily."
Eve,3dyr0o,Artichoke11,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"I've heard that once TiDi kicks in, shields get even better because regen is bugged to not scale with TiDi and you regen X% more effective shields because of the TiDi applying to incoming DPS but not your passive R(egen)PS."
Eve,3dyr0o,UpgradeNova,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe, to be honest though the passive regen is really an ancillary benefit at best, I think at most, with heat and links, a wyvern passive tanks like 10k (1 dread). If you are in a situation in which there is that much tidi though, you'd be getting hit with enough dps that it doesn't matter at all.   Would be nice when everyone is smart bombing though, in the only major fight I've used my nyx in, I got nearly into armor from the 30 other supers running smart bombs."
Eve,3dyr0o,Artichoke11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"Fully tank fit with implants they have very similar EHP (~42M) but the Wyvern has the advantage that it can heat all its mids. Just heating 2 a-type invulns give almost 7M EHP (3 doomsdays worth). Heating everything the Wyvern gets 86M and the Aeon 64M, that's 7 doomsdays difference."
Eve,3dyr0o,portionsforfoxes,3,Mon Jul 20 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"Everyone talks about how the hel has shit tank but heated, with no fleet boosts it has 62M EHP."
Eve,3dyr0o,solidcopy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"so why is it armor super fleets and not shield if their is that much of a diffrence, if shield supers can tank that much more why did all the blocs in game go to armor tanked supercap fleets versus the tankier shield supers?"
Eve,3dyr0o,MakinthatISK,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"In the old days shield warfare links and bonuses wouldn't actually fill your shield to the new maximum, for example when jumping into a new system. Given the gigantic raw shield/armor amount you get from a Levi/Erebus booster, having full armor and slightly less EHP was considered better than having somewhat more total EHP but starting with only 60% of it. That's one reason at least, tbh it's before my time."
Eve,3dyr0o,portionsforfoxes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming because there's more subcap armor fleets ? Think about it, not so long ago Battleship fleets weren't rare (Golden Fleet to cite one) and they are superior compared to shield in the sense that they are less vulnerable to bombs (doesn't mean impervious to them !) so it would make sense to go for armor doctrines & supercaps.  Also Archon > anything else (bar few situations) and there's your answer."
Eve,3dyr0o,jD_Aerendir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"Aeon still has the largest ARMOR tank, like he said"
Eve,3dyr0o,siquerty,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:22 2015 UTC,super carriers or motherships as they were once called are scaled up carriers they still act as drone boats/logiboats but are unable to field anything less than bombers and fighters(anyone who actually flys them correct me if im wrong)   they have bays so players can dock ships and change fits. aswell as clone bays so players can jump clone to them.  there is not much difference between the 4 they all function the same it just depends on the fleet doctrine your useing EG armor fleets like AEONS and shields like Wyverns  as far as surviving... if you in a super cap you are going to die.... eventually.... but there is no ship that has marginal survivalbilty over the other.  TL:DR cool ships but expensive space coffins

Eve,3e1mpo,sandmanza,5,Tue Jul 21 07:00:09 2015 UTC,"None of the ""newbie corps"" will destroy their futures.    If you starting with a group of friends, I would suggest that you hit the career agents, the epic arc all that normal stuff, and then play in HS as a group for a while.  There really is no reason to rush out of HS while you having fun.    The thing is at some point HS can stop being fun.  At that point (or preferable before that point) you need to start planning to move out of HS.  You need to avoid the trap of ""HS is boring!  EvE is boring!""."
Eve,3e1mpo,MrFreeman,4,Tue Jul 21 07:51:44 2015 UTC,Recommend Eve University. Every one accepts their graduate level members.
Eve,3e1mpo,McDarila,4,Tue Jul 21 07:31:45 2015 UTC,"but for a brand new experience they will be wanting to learn how eve works, do high sec missions, fly the ships they want to fly    Stay in a starter corp until you finish the SOE arc. I feel like too many new players log into the game and join a corp immediately. It's hard to learn how to turn the camera around if you're wardecced from the get-go.  Now that I think about it...if you start applications for E-UNI when you first join, you'll probably finish SOE before you get accepted."
Eve,3e1mpo,anternika,6,Tue Jul 21 07:51:10 2015 UTC,"In any sort of newbie corp, youll not want to do highsec missions, since the moment you get a decent number of members you will be wardecced to hell and back. And what's wrong with doctrines as long as they arent complete garbage?"
Eve,3e1mpo,Teebeutel_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:06:33 2015 UTC,Doctrines are great but for a new player it sucks to be taken away from what you want to fly. The only newbie corps I have been in are PH and Brave before moving on and both of them were mainly Missile based setups with Ewar on the side. What if a person doesn't like Missiles and wants to use drones or lasers ?
Eve,3e1mpo,dudemaaan,3,Tue Jul 21 07:33:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on how new you are. When you are really new and can only fly frigates it mostly doesn't matter what you fly as long as it goes fast and has a point.  Later on, you can still take non doctrine ships on fun fleets, just keep the tank type, speed and effective range the same as the main fit and you should be find. Ex. you could take a mwd moa on a caracal fleet. You won't be as effective of course but you can still fly what you want.      For super serious stuff bringing what you want is just not an option tho, because the doctrines are there for a reason. The fc needs to know what his fleet is capable of, how fast it goes and how much damage he can tank with the amount of logi he has and stuff like that. If you don't like what a particular corp flies you need to find one that has doctrines you like, always going kitchen sink will get you nowhere."

Eve,3dzlpj,DarknessTemple,26,Mon Jul 20 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are suggesting T3s, but I've found the best safety from bubbles is practice, not using a ship that's worth more that you'll make in multiple nights of exploring. I managed to lose only two explo ships in a couple months of doing exploration and both times were to me being prideful and saying 'eh I know there's a camp but I'll just MWD cloak through instead of waiting'.  The best option for avoiding drag bubbles is to create tactical bookmarks 200km away from each of the gates on your route. Then you can warp to those instead of the gate directly and avoid any bubbles set to catch people warping directly to the gate. If you're in an area you don't have bookmarks for then you can warp to a celestial near the gate and dscan it before warping there. If there are no celestials within dscan range of the gate, you can use cap dumping to check it out.  If you jump into a camp with an interdictor that bubbles the gate when you jump in you have two options.  1: Cloak + MWD and burn away from the gate and avoid them getting within 2km of you.  2: Cloak + MWD back to the gate and then repeat on the other side until they run out of bubbles or you get a few seconds ahead of them.  Option 1 will work 90% of the time, but if there's a ton of people I'd go with option 2. Covert Ops are so fast that even by the time they could decloak you, you'll be almost within jump range of the gate and can jump before they lock you.  As for people ganking you in sites, if someone comes into system and drops probes, CLOAK UP UNTIL THEY ARE GONE (or fly an astero and kill them yourself). If you jump into a system and someone is afk cloaked, it's best just to keep going, but if you're set on doing the site make sure to check their killboard to see if they have explorer kills. If you do choose to do the site, I recommend paying attention and having a celestial pre-selected to warp out to instead of being slow and trying to fit a ton of stabs. Even against bombers you're able to warp out in time if you're paying attention.  Finally, if you use something cheaper than a T3 like a Heron or Buzzard, you'll make more than enough ISK to die learning indefinitely. You can make the cost of a Heron in a single can in a nullsec relic site, and a Buzzard in a single site. Don't be scared, just practice."
Eve,3dzlpj,Snoowi,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:52 2015 UTC,Pretty good advice there
Eve,3dzlpj,IrishPotatoHead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"By the same token, fit these cheap ships with nanofibers and overdrive injectors instead of warp stabs. If you get locked while uncloaked you are most likely dead anyways, the agility mods will make you much harder to decloak while you make the 10 second run out of the bubble. If you get caught in a site they will usually have enough points to cancel out your stabs and you deserve to die anyways :)"
Eve,3dzlpj,ithicaBuelle,0,Tue Jul 21 00:38:21 2015 UTC,"This, basically. An Astero or Covops with an MWD should legitimately never get caught by a gatecamp unless they have extremely pro decloakers. Never warp to an unscanned gate at 0. Ever. If you jump into a Sabre bubble on the other side of a gate:  1) Breathe and evaluate. You have 30secs. Stay calm. 2) Pick a direction to fly that gets you out of the bubble ASAP, and is also off line from the bad people. Manually fly in that direction. 3) As soon as you break cloak, Hit your MWD. The cycle will keep your speed up the whole time until the cloak deactivates it. Hit your cloak as soon as the MWD is confirmed active. Basically immediately. The cloak activation will cancel locking attempts. 4) As you're burning away, change direction to randomly 45° off original angle. Decloakers will be aimed where you were headed, not where you're headed now. 5) Start warping somewhere good as soon as you clear the skin of the bubble. 6) o7 the bad people who wanted to touch you inappropriately in Local.   Never been caught by a bubbler yet in my Astero ( knock on wood ). Not to say it can't happen, but it should be EXTREMELY rare.  Taking the time to establish good tacticals along any well trod relic route is essential. Take the time whenever systems are clear, it'll save you a lossmail later on."
Eve,3dzlpj,LlamaStar,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:31 2015 UTC,Hit your cloak as soon as the MWD is confirmed active.   You can actually just cloak and then mwd right after and it will still go off.
Eve,3dzlpj,Frekavichk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:37 2015 UTC,Depending on fits an Astero is often able to straight up outrun a Sabre with MWD. Unless you spawn in scram range there's no way you should die to a solo Sabre.
Eve,3dzlpj,CypherZer0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:10 2015 UTC,CLOAK BEFORE MWD  If you MWD first you are just increasing your signature radius and making it easier for the enemy to get a lock.

Eve,3dzlpj,NullSecHobo,3,Mon Jul 20 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"A T3 is the only ship with bonuses to exploration that can be immune to bubbles.  Really though it's pretty easy to avoid people in a cloaky MWD cov ops.  Don't warp directly to your outgate with people in the system.  If you jump into a bubble, cloak and MWD away from everyone."
Eve,3dzlpj,PhoenixReborn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"Use an interceptor, any interceptor that can align in under 2 seconds is basically uncatchable, the only way you'll die is to a smart bomb trap or if you get caught while doing a site.  It's highly unlikely you'll find smart bomb traps in null, and if you are cautious and just find quiet systems, only doing sites while no one is in local would make it impossible to catch you in a site (but reduce your isk/hour, so it's up to you)  The locals probably won't bother to chase down an interceptor as long as you aren't threatening.  Since interceptors don't get any bonuses you need good skills, including Arch V, but once you have the skills it works just fine.  There's no reason to bring out a T3 when a 20 million isk Interceptor can do the job just as well."
Eve,3dzlpj,EvadableMoxie,0,Mon Jul 20 21:44:08 2015 UTC,I have a Stilleto fit that I used to use in Syndicate. Isn't exactly a traditional exploration fit but it works and is immune to bubbles.
Eve,3dzlpj,TzuWu,0,Mon Jul 20 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good comments here. I'll point out the two major advantages that the Astero brings to the table over CovOps or Ceptors: the ability to kill other explorers and take their stuff, and the ability to run Limited Sleeper Cache sites, which CAN be very profitable. Ceptors can do the first ( I'd argue not as well actually since they can see you on D Scan whereas a lurking Astero with sites scanned ahead of time and a scram on is basically death for either of the other two options ), but definitely would struggle to do the second."
Eve,3dzlpj,LlamaStar,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"I wanted SO MUCH to come in here and say Luxury Yacht. Sadly they only have one high slot, so you cannot scan with them.  :c  I GUESS an inty can be used for explo, but let's be real: Your best option is still gonna be an astero 95% of the time. T3's are too much boat for the mission, though they would work.  What snoowi said about avoiding gate camps is 100% right. The same goes for WH camps, BTW.  Generally any warp-cloaky covops frig can work, astero's probably the best for a lot of people. I use a helios personally."
Eve,3dzlpj,Abrahemp,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:07 2015 UTC,"Consider starting with bombers. They are cheap, warp cloaked, and have enough mids to do exploration. Or use a ceptor with exploration mods. But the best way to avoid bubbles is to use bookmarks around the gates. Make them right at 300-300km away (edge of the grid is 350km; Google grid fu manual) and use those to get around them. If you do not have a bm and the gate is not near anything else to to warp to something so that your incoming direction is not coming from any gates or stations."
Eve,3dzlpj,sendeth,4,Mon Jul 20 21:49:18 2015 UTC,Why would you go with a bomber when it's about the same price as an actual T2 exploration Frigate and requires all the same skills?
Eve,3dzlpj,EvadableMoxie,3,Mon Jul 20 23:36:48 2015 UTC,What he said. Bombers are stupid for this and give zero benefit over a CovOps.
Eve,3dzlpj,LlamaStar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Not only that,but it also isn't immune to bubbles like op wanted."
Eve,3dzlpj,Silberlos,0,Tue Jul 21 01:16:32 2015 UTC,I like to be able to lock instantly. If you uncloak and instalock a frig sitting still while hacking you can kill them in a single volley. Not so effective against small moving ships but decent against cruiser and larger rats. Bombers are very versatile ships. I'm not saying they are the best but they can be nice to have in certain situations. The best ship is still the Astero.

I am trained in the Old Testament and I’m the top converter in the entire church mission group. You are nothing to me but just another heathen. I will cast your sins out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Heaven, mark my diddily-iddilly words. You think you can get away with saying that blasphemy to me over the Internet? Think again, friendarino. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of evangelists across Springfield and your IP is being traced by God right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggorino. The storm that wipes out the diddily little thing you call your life of sin. You’re going to Church, kiddily-widdily. Jesus can be anywhere, anytime, and he can turn you to the Gospel in over infinity ways, and that’s just with his bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in preaching to nonbelievers, but I have access to the entire dang- diddily Bible collection of the Springfield Bible College and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your sins away off the face of the continent, you diddily-doo satan-worshipper. If only you could have known what holy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you from the Heavens, maybe you would have held your darn-diddily-fundgearoo tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re clean of all your sins, you widdillo-skiddily neighborino. I will sing hymns of praise all over you and you will drown in the love of Christ.

Eve,3e0d0r,jokeres,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"The Tengu is the best switchblade, and shield being active tank and missiles being easy, you really don't need much in the way of support skills for it to be p. good.  Just gotta get those range skills."
Eve,3e0d0r,YenThara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"Its the best pve ship, its got good tank and good damage which you can change out for whatever damage type you want."
Eve,3e0d0r,Brandan182,4,Tue Jul 21 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Legion.  HAMs - duh. Don't like HAMs? What about  Neuts and drones - seriously underrated legion setup. Pick your fights right and it'll wreck face  Lazors - none of the other t3s let you shoot forth glorious beams of colored light to melt the armor of your foe.  On a slightly more serious note, the Tengu is considered the best because of its high damage application even at range, and crazy good shield tank. I fly a Proteus for solo pvp, a Tengu for ratting ""safely"" I don't typically warp off if a neutral comes into sys, just refit at ye old depot And have a ham legion for  when I wanna clear belts really fast"
Eve,3e0d0r,ChevisPreston,2,Tue Jul 21 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"Solo PvP all time: Cloaky Proteus. Great tank and beastmode DPS, all wrapped together with bindings that you can't see because it is cloaky.  Group PvP: Legion. Sexy hams can't get neuted out, and neut legions absolutely wreck face. Together with guardians, you have an awesome looking group for small-gang.  For the other two, I would recommend the tengu. The tank is great for things such as DED sites and PvE (can run C3s)."
Eve,3e0d0r,Adarnof,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"T3s are a bit of a waste for L4s (or vice-versa?) - a generic battleship can get equal DPS and tank for half the pricetag and training time.  For exploration, typically shield T3s are recommended because their tank will not suffer from the interdiction nullifier sub and can fit for agility - thus Tengu > Loki > else.  For WH PVE, all T3s have a viable fit. Tengus are most popular here because of tank + application, I personally flew a shield loki, and have corpmates flying protei and legions (typically dualrep). Honestly there's no clear winner here, but (I hate to admit it) the loki is the wors by a fraction.  Each T3 has a role in PVP. I'm partial to my blaster proteus for engagements on the holes, but the legion's versatility really shines here - neut + drone, HAM (omgyesss), scorch OP, you name it.  If I had to pick one it'd be Loki. Doesn't excel at any one role but can play many. Pitiful damage with any fit, but dank web bonus, can get solid tank, and viable in both shield and armor fleets."

Eve,3e0d0r,Jaylanestran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:44 2015 UTC,"The fact that you want to do some pve suggests you will probably be best off with a Tengu or perhaps a Legion. The nice thing about the legion is that you can fit for pvp, although it is not the best solo pvp-er. Legion will still have high utility as neut support or tanky damage. Proteus is the best pvp solo, but all of the tech 3s can be neutralized by a good counter and then you have to retrain something to V and are out a 0.6-1 billion isk. Unless by exploration you mean sleeper cache sites, tech 3 is too overkill to risk. Doing relic and data sites is a great way to get caught in any ship and is going to happen sometimes. Any of the tech iiis can be fitted to do sleeper cache sites, however. All this considered, Legion might be the best for you to do both pvp and pve."

Eve,3e0d0r,Phoenix-Jones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"You want flexibility.  Loki is good but doesn't bring the deeps you want for level 4 missioning.  The proteus is a awesome hunter, but is vulnerable.  You can do missions in it but it'll most likely be a railboat.  Legion is growing on people, lasers and Hams are great on it, and it has a great tank.  Tengu is default on all though.   I'd keep it simple, tengu"

Eve,3dxg9e,raphendyr,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"Not really a good example, as the ""American ideal"" isn't very much about guns anymore (if it ever was). What you are talking about is RPing some sort of super radical viewpoint far, far removed from what most Minmatar think and have ever thought.   A better comparison, I'd say, would be dressing up as a KKK member while saying you are role playing as an African."

Eve,3dxg9e,darthgoupil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely.  Minmatar roleplay does not have to follow linear Minmatar ideals, in fact the more that do this actually create stale generic roleplay scenarios.  As long as his character grew up in Minmatar or Amarr space and was influenced by the events of his life and you can give him some legit reasons for his beliefs it is of course Minmatar RP, it is just not following traditional Minmatar beliefs.  You take this course with the understanding that many traditional Minmatar rpers will IC dislike you, but I don't think this is a bad thing. It gives him a interesting dynamic whereby he loves his brethren but has fallen into a cycle of hate at the Amarr so much so that his actions of revenge betray the very beliefs of the Minmatar. That is fantastic.  /u/CyborgTriceratops - I would read through the character profiles on the backstage and router 109 forums and build yourself a solid backstory around your idea. Look forward to seeing you in action :)"

Eve,3dxg9e,StupidSexyConnor,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"You have a number of options. Some basic archetypes are:   Republic loyalist  Anti-slaver partisan  Tribal Matari  Nomadic / Itinerant   ...and there are others. RP organizations exist for FW, piracy, industry, and exploration. It's obvious from your current affiliation that you support PvP, and U'K is an option for that.   Minmatar RP is currently trying to wriggle out of a pattern of insularity, particularly corp-level RP that remains behind closed doors. There is a Minmatar.OOC channel to help coordinate events and interactions, and a Minmatar RP mailing list.   The two most-used resources for RP out of the CCP sphere are Backstage and Router 109. Each has a good deal of prime fiction, player content, and event planning, plus people who can help cultivate the type of Minmatar RP you are seeking.  If you need any recommendations, let me know. Good luck, and hope to see you in space!"
