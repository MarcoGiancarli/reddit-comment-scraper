dbxv,3dpti3,YouveGotAids,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:29:46 2015 UTC,"Thats what was stumbling me, everytime I attack they seem to block, even when performing their special Kamehameha, if I attack before they perform, they're blocking. Yamcha and Tien seem to do nothing as all three Cell Jr.'s attack me. The first part is hard but I usually get through it everytime, the last part is the hardest. After a few hours of play Parallel Quests I leveled up and got some pretty good moves. I use x20 Kaio Ken and then I spam Weekend and a fully charged Kamehameha and usually get through the first three untouched. The hard part comes when all three are ganging up on me, they make it hard to use capsules to refill health because they are always juggling you, but if you can take out 1 the other 2 become pretty easy. I finally beat it today on my second try. Mira and Cell were jokes, and I don't know what comes next, i'll have to play some more later today. Thanks for the advice though, luckily I didn't have to use but one medium capsule, saved me some money."

dbxv,3dpti3,GhastlyGrim,2,Sat Jul 18 10:45:57 2015 UTC,"A few tricks you can try to sort of ""cheese"" hard missions:   Good AOE Ultimates are god send on maps with multiple weak enemies.  For Strike Ultimate try Blue Hurricane (also the best for farming giant apes btw) For Ki Ultimate try Death Ball, Giant Storm, or one of the many Kamehameha's.   There are a few specials that do not require energy or ki, these help a lot in positioning. Afterimage Strike is my personal favorite and can set up positioning for an ultimate without getting your stamina drained.   If you use ""Why Youuuuu"" soul it will give you a big boost in ki everytime you get a killing blow. On missions with lots of small enemies you can keep your ki near max the entire fight even in SS/SV form.   Using 2xTowa (the character) on a mission gives you a big boost in Ki right at the start of the match (meaning you dont need to build it before going SS/SV) this coupled with ""Why Youuu"" means that you can start the match as SS/SV and never run out of ki while spamming your preferred Ultimate.   Lastly, don't be worried about trying to S or Z every PQ/mission as you get to them, just beat them and revisit them after you've collected some of the stronger abilities."
dbxv,3dpti3,NekoFuzion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:44:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure this is a story mission. He can''t bring 2 Towas but Blue Hurricane is a beautiful skill

You're better off getting your ki by throwing fists with your opponent that way you deal damage to him and gain ki and you're not just sitting around being a target for a quick galick gun. Maybe replace it with something like shine shot. It does some alright damage and I'm my case it hits most of the time. It's also realm good for setting up ki combos. Shoot shine shot,use something quick with knockback like galick gun or crusher ball, then either use an attack that stuns or paralyzes them and throws out your ultimate. Experiment with your moves and try chaining then together, it's the only thing ki users have going for them except spamming. And with spamming if you are facing a dude that knows how to get around your spamming you're most likely fucked."

dbxv,3dl1gx,ragadavi,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:36 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things that could make Xenoverse a better game, but with all the stuff that we want they'd be better off making a brand new game."
dbxv,3dl1gx,NekoFuzion,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with expanding the current game is that they can't actually make any big changes to it because the budget simply won't be allocated for anything that can't be directly sold.  For example, changing character height/weight & clothing to not be tied to stats would be a HUGE change that would warrant a re-thinking of how they handle stats in the entire game proper. Redoing character creation with additional options (like adding sliders instead of picking from 1/3 options) would also be a major undertaking that would warrant a separate SKU.   Things like that aren't done as free patches because the development time always costs money. They have to monetize it somehow, and the easiest way to do that is simply to sell it all in a sequel rather than trying to sell them out piecemeal as DLC (something that is actually impossible in the case of major system changes as obviously that would result in incompatible clients).   Personally, I wouldn't be against the game simply getting yearly iterations that just add more stuff and polish up old systems. That sort of thing is totally right up my alley. The only problem is making sure the improvements are big enough to warrant a new purchase, while also not going crazy over-budget such that it's impossible to get a return on that investment.  But who knows what direction Namco Bandai is going to go in? All we know is that Xenoverse sold a lot, and they're probably going to be doing something else in that direction, be it a sequel or a new game in the same vein."

dbxv,3dlh2f,HiiiPower27,3,Fri Jul 17 06:01:38 2015 UTC,"I dont have any dlc, but i got the impression from youtubers that it is still the old method. So if someone posts a different way you probably want to do that. I didnt play in a while, i dont know the exact pq numbers anymore.  Lvl 1-45 do the dragonball broly mission in a public game, gather 2 dragonballs, kill broly, kill him again (ult. Finisher) and catch em all. Try to not get hit, hit 20 basic kii blasts, all the good stuff for a z rank.   Alternatively you can do it solo, just gather the 3 dragonballs.  Lvl 45+ join a public game for pq 52, the 3 great apes. Best case you get matched with people that know what they are doing-> everybody solos an ape.  How to solo an ape: fly as high as possible over his head, stop moving, target his head and shoot basic ki blasts. When he goes unconcious grab the apes tail. Preferably again you dont want to get hit, make 3 grabs, connect 20 ki blasts, maybe connect 3 supers.  Troubleshooting if the apes act wierd: sometimes the ape doesnt take damage from basic kii blasts. You will have to fly to his head and melee his head with basic attacks, the same if he spams his shout.  Glhf may you never get tired of these missions .^"
dbxv,3dlh2f,Nimesaloteth,2,Fri Jul 17 06:47:34 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for that detailed post. I never knew about that way to solo an ape. I just always go for the tail
dbxv,3dlh2f,Zyrusticae,4,Fri Jul 17 07:03:25 2015 UTC,"Another way to solo the apes is simply to use Blue Hurricane spam. Works best with high strike super power, naturally (you can gather dragon balls to respec for this, though you'd have to gather them twice if you don't want that character to be a strike specialist so that's something to consider).   Once your damage is high enough, if you have the DLC, you can move to doing the second ape quest (it's the very last one on the list). You can regularly score 90-125k XP through that one, and it only takes a few minutes with Blue Hurricane spam + tail throws. It's basically your only good option for leveling 85+."

Literally grinding the same mission 8-12 hours just to reach the max level is not fun."
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:55:36 2015 UTC,Wait i dont get what you're saying can you explain please
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,2,Sat Jul 18 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"Inevitably there are some rather skilled individuals who will make a program that can alter characters in a game. These are typically called trainers, for some reason or another. Typically they're used to cheat, such as giving yourself access to things that you normally wouldn't. In the case of this game, you could give yourself SSJ3 or other skills, and stats that are ridiculously high. You cannot play online with them, though.  You can also alter your level/experience to reach the max, and not give your character any advantages in the process. Many people consider this ""unfair"" and ""cheating"", despite it not giving you any distinct advantage over your opponent. There are moral arguments for and against it.  I tend to be of the opinion that if a game is poorly designed and breaks some of the fundamentals of game design, then there is no issue with you bypassing poorly designed limitations on play. The leveling system in this game is exceptionally bad once you try to level beyond 85. It will take you a while to reach 85, but once you reach that point the ""fastest"" way to level legitimately is through a character with high strike supers, using Blue Hurricane on the three apes in Return of the Great Ape Festival. Using this method, which is the fastest way in the game, will take you approximately 8 hours to reach level 99.  This is bad game design. You do not repeat the same content for hours upon hours just to reach the max level. This is a guaranteed way to piss off your players and completely destroy their desire to play the game. There is only a certain level of replayability to these missions, but doing them for 8 hours straight? Hell no. It's not even healthy for players."
dbxv,3dlh2f,Skreevy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:17 2015 UTC,I am in complete agreement with that. Is this method you're talking about restricted to PC only though? Im on ps4
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:44 2015 UTC,I only know about the PC version.
dbxv,3dlh2f,l32uigs,0,Sat Jul 18 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"If all I do is Level up with that, will I still be able to play online?"
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. You could have leveled up in offline mode as far as the game's servers are concerned. And no one can tell the difference because you're not artificially inflating your stats to values you can't normally reach, nor giving yourself access to abilities you shouldn't have access to."
dbxv,3dlh2f,l32uigs,0,Mon Jul 20 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the game then don't play it.  If you think the game design is so bad then why do you want to play the game?  Dragon ball has always been grindy, even the show.  How many episodes did Goku fight Frieza for?  You're criticizing grinding in a game based on a universe where the characters regularly spend monthes/years straight running the same track/mundanely exercising in hyperbolic time chamber.    All of the enjoyment you get from a game like this goes out the window when you set your state to ""100% completion"".  Getting Super Saiyan isn't rewarding if you obtain it easily.  Reaching max level isn't rewarding if it isn't difficult.  People like you are the reason games like Diablo 2 were shit for anyone who wanted to play the way the game was meant to.    I love poker, but only when we're playing for millions, so I'll use fake money and play a fake poker game and have just as much fun = your logic."
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:46 2015 UTC,"Your white knight is showing.  On a more serious note, there are plenty of examples where players enjoy games despite said game having very poorly designed elements. I enjoy playing DBXV, but I don't like the nonsensical grind they've introduced. That doesn't mean I feel the game is bad, but that it simply has poorly designed elements.  I'm also going to point out a few major flaws in your argument:  1st) Setting yourself to max level does not mean you are setting the game to 100% completion. Max level means just that: Max level. Being max level does not automatically unlock all Masters at max friendship, nor does it unlock all gear and abilities. It simply means that you are maxed on experience. No extra unlocks. No unlocked abilities that you didn't have others, just max level.  2nd) If you think reaching max level is difficult, I'd like to know how you feel about genuine difficulty. Reaching max level in DBXV is not difficult at all. It is time consuming. Gaining exp is ridiculously easy. All you need is a strike-heavy character with Blue Hurricane, and getting to max level becomes nothing more than a mindless grind. They are artificially increasing the ""difficulty"" by dramatically inflating the amount of experience you need to reach max level. Again, reaching max level isn't difficult, only time consuming.  3rd) Your White Knight is showing again. Diablo 2's leveling system is very different from DBXV. While you did replay the same missions over and over again to get better gear, there was always some random element included. You could also increase the difficulty. DBXV has no variation at all, outside of ""Did RNG trigger to get me the full version of this level?"" Each PQ is exactly the same no matter how many times you do it. The only thing that changes is the player-character that sometimes spawns, and they're not even a challenge.  4th) Some people enjoy playing poker without risking money? What the hell kind of argument is that? Seriously? I mean, really? Are you serious?  P.S. Saying the series was grindy to justify a terrible grind... That made my day. :)"
dbxv,3dlh2f,l32uigs,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"You should write a book justifying cheating in games.  If you don't enjoy the game don't play it.  You're not getting the experience the game has to offer when you use a trainer to skip to the end.  The games not meant to be a grind, it's meant to be a platform where progress can be made for a long time.  If you're going to use a trainer, why not just play m.u.g.e.n.?  If you don't want to play poker for money, play with fake money with other people playing with fake money - you don't counterfeit to create money you never had so you can participate in something you haven't earned.    You're clearly dead-set on justifying your behaviour.  I'll leave you to it.  You should consider the damage you do to people when you offer them a cheat when they're looking for a guide.  What kind of person does that?   P.S. I'm glad I made your day but I'm worried that your standards aren't high enough.  I really hope I don't see you in one of these ""Why isn't World Tournament a thing?"" threads."
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:39 2015 UTC,You really need to work on your debate skills. Why don't you improve your skills and come back after you've trained some more?

There is no competitive scene for this game because people are so willing to change their save data.  That's about as far as you'll affect the majority of people.  Just consider what type of person you are.  If you're older than 12 and still hacking you've got some stuff to think about lol."
dbxv,3dlh2f,Averath,2,Mon Jul 20 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"You do realize that if you change your game data and alter your stats to a value that is not attainable, you will not be allowed to log onto their servers due to the game detecting that your save file was ""corrupted"", right? You sound as if you really really suck at PvP and you're taking your rage and frustration out on someone else.  You cannot use a trainer to give you an unfair advantage in PvP. Their servers would detect the discrepancy and not allow you to sign in. You would likely need a separate program entirely to get around that, if it is even possible.  It is also quite clear that you're not objective at all in this discussion, judging by your responses. You're allowing your frustration with PvP to color your opinion of poorly designed elements in a game. To borrow from your argument earlier and hopefully help you understand: It is because of players like you that game designers never learn from their mistakes and react viciously to criticism. Players like you will praise anything and everything that make, and will not think analytically about the game itself. You just want your opinion given to you."

I would say this is what's most likely going to happen, but with a potential season 2 DLC who knows."

I'd also like to see a more complete character roster, inclusion of all the CaC's the player makes, and a better local multiplayer overall, since the only stage you can play on is the world tournament stage and the screen is shared instead of split like BT3. But if it doesn't happen and we get some kind of Dragonball Z + Dragonball Super game, I'd be fine, as long as all the characters are there coughimperfectcellcough"
dbxv,3dcyko,Elevas,3,Wed Jul 15 08:13:51 2015 UTC,"To me, SSJ and SSJ2 should be more special, acquiring them through story in a cutscene instead of grinding PQs/Buying it at a certain point in the story. SSJ3 should come with huge drawbacks, and SSJ2 more wild hair and more visible electricity. Don't want everyone being a SSJ3 because it's a direct upgrade, it should be for specific builds, as it would have large drawbacks but specific upgrades. SSJ should drain little energy, using it as a long term SSJ, and SSJ2 fast energy drain, making it also used as part of builds instead of a direct upgrade, but still be good enough if you're just using it as a upgrade from SSJ1. SSJ forms should be more special and more of a use in builds instead of adding them on just to have them. Legendary should be Broly only, lol. Only thing coming from that is fanfics and Mary-sue OCs. Only thing legendary, if implemented, is large increase in strike specials and basic attacks, as well as stamina."
dbxv,3dcyko,BlueBlurX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:27:03 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of SSJ3 being a difference of kind, not a difference of scale. It should certainly burn faster than any other SSJ, but there should be more to it.  I really enjoyed getting SSJ from the PQ: made me feel amazing when I used it during the Frieza fight. From there, similarly, it felt amazing when I got SV and SV2. Am yet to use SSJ2 despite having bought it. SSJ3 would be amazing... Just a hair model swap and some altered specifics and I'd love it. Heck, if they just made it a reskin of SSJ2, I'd be fine.  And glad we agree on the LSSJ. :P"
dbxv,3dcyko,AzoGalvat,3,Wed Jul 15 09:38:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see no reason why any saiyan shouldn't be able to go to SSJ3 with enough training. SSG and LSSJ are special circumstances, so it's logical to never have them available to custom characters.  Ideally, what I'd like to see out of custom SSJs is to have the hair actually change. It would require new assets (particularly on SSJ3), but it'd be helpful in getting players immersed."
dbxv,3dcyko,AzoGalvat,3,Wed Jul 15 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. During customisation, I was expecting an option to be able to ""select your super saiyan hair"" or something.

I hate seeing heaviest builds of male Earthlings outside of Ranked because they're so OP. CaC racial balances are unbelievable. I've seen like 2 decent Namekians because the truth is, Namekians are horribad. I don't think it's so much that CaC are overpowered as roster characters are underpowered. Roster character's attribute points are mostly dumped into health/ki/stam, while of course every CaC will have at least one damage stat maxed out leading to huge damage imbalances when you fight roster vs CaC. Seems like the devs didn't really think about different builds themselves and assumed players would use their points differently... Agreed on the clothes. They make up way too much of a difference, potentially raising a stat by a whole 25%. No training mode, shitty ability descriptions, brain-dead Artificial ""Intelligence"", it really is like DIMPs just didn't care... You could make the argument that this game is meant to be played with other people, but I think I agree that the AI is also the worst I've ever seen in any video game. ...Man you really hate on this game, but I see you post videos so often, and you're really good?

It has some weird issues like most skills being luck based, and the online takes way too much time to prepare for without much payout, but the game itself is very enjoyable despite the grind.  My personal suggestion would be to start out as a ki using human. They're easier to play the story with, but nothing is stopping you from doing otherwise. I personally played as a male striker saiyan. (not a very good build but it got me through the story, after story and dlc) I've personally put 186 hours into the game according to Steam."

dbxv,3dchnj,Zyrusticae,2,Wed Jul 15 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty great.   The core combat system is one of the better ones in DBZ games. Very simple on the surface but with a surprising amount of depth once you actually dig into it. The number of supers and ultimates you can pick and choose from is HUUUGE. Most attacks that ever show up in the show appear here and can be used by custom characters.   The character creation is easily the game's greatest asset. It's easy to become attached to your characters as they really feel like they fit within the universe of Dragon Ball, and there are so many costumes and accessories to kit your characters out with. I'm a bit miffed by height and weight being tied to stats, and they could really use some body sliders, but it's a really great first start and shows huge promise for a sequel (oh gawd I hope a sequel is in development...).  The story, too, is actually pretty good, and since it's basically stolen from Dragon Ball Online that means it's actually canon(!!)! It's got a great presentation and really feels like a fast-paced extension of the series.  Graphics... depends on what system you get it for. I play it on PC and it's beautiful and silky-smooth at 60 FPS. It's got a weirdly shiny art style compared to previous games, but I think it's something you can get used to (and you have the option of turning down the bloom in the options menu).   Sound effects are about what you'd expect, but where the game really shines in this area is the sheer number of voiced lines in the game. Characters will remark on your created character's race, and there's TONS of banter in the game between characters that know each other, and even ones that don't (i.e. Bardock and most of Goku's family and friends). There's just toooons of fan service in this game. Music's pretty good too, though I know this one's a taste thing.  But there is one thing that everyone complains about, and it's the RNG. Be prepared to spend LOTS of time farming quests for specific items you want with low drop rates. The Elder Kai will occasionally help you with that if he's your master, but most of the time you're just going to have to keep on fighting and fighting and fighting some more if you want to build up your stash. Oh, and the AI is all over the place in this game. Sometimes they're just really dumb, and sometimes they're just incredibly cheap.   Also, the online is kind of laggy, so there's that. (Personally, I don't do too much co-op or online versus and just stick with solo questing, which is still plenty entertaining for me.)   If you can stomach all that, the game will probably last you a good while. I've put 79 hours into it so far and I'm probably not stopping any time soon. Every time I watch Dragon Ball Super I just want to log back in again, haha. I just really hope the sequel pans out."
dbxv,3dchnj,Elevas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"Most of what you said sums up how I feel about this game. It's one of the best games I've ever played, and I love how attached I am to my character. There're a few little things missing; but I've certainly played the crap out of this game and have every intention of getting the DLC if I can figure out how to buy the DLC for my Australian disc using my American account (without repurchasing the core game).  Edit: Also, yes... That NPC situation is SUPER cheap. I didn't even get that far. At least you landed a handful of hits. It is truly idiotic that that is one of the missions we're expected to do solo."
dbxv,3dchnj,WeedHumpster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"That one mission can be done pretty easily by continuing to move around, and managing your stamina. As long as you've remembered to level up as well, and if you decide to get the DLCs, there's a z-soul from Tien which will completely make you immune to all kamehameha attacks, a nice bonus to people having trouble with missions like this.  The RNG has gotten better a few patches ago, even without Elder Kai you can still have a pretty good chance at getting your skills.  As for online; I've got almost 600 hours in this game, PvP really isn't as laggy as people make it out to be, it depends on how far you are from each other, and your connection to each other (fucking peer to peer, but japs love it, apparently), I really enjoy the PvP in this game, and it's one of the things that keeps me coming back to it, occasionally you'll meet cheap shit like a Kaioken x20 spam build, but soon enough you'll learn how to work around it and actually straight up destroy the cheap builds.  Overall, for OP, if you enjoy DBZ, this game is most definitely worth putting your time in to, as is the DLC if you enjoy the game."

dbxv,3db1kk,Dr_Midnight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:55:36 2015 UTC,Indeed. That's all of the DLC quests (to date).
dbxv,3d9y7u,dopeminebeats,3,Tue Jul 14 17:26:14 2015 UTC,Same thing that happened to removing stat from the gear or put another tab for appearances and another for stats...
dbxv,3d9y7u,ragadavi,5,Tue Jul 14 21:34:16 2015 UTC,I don't think that ever was planned for the game though world tournament was
dbxv,3d9y7u,huff610,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"This. I wanted this feature, so characters could diversify their looks and not every Ki-Based Saiyan would look the same. Wish the team for DBXV would hear us out"
dbxv,3d9y7u,forbiddenone,4,Fri Jul 17 00:46:41 2015 UTC,Piccolo blew up the arena ;).
dbxv,3d9y7u,forbiddenone,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:55:39 2015 UTC,No......the arena is still there everytime I play endless battle -_____-
dbxv,3d9nfk,JosephSarkis47,5,Tue Jul 14 16:11:51 2015 UTC,IMO SSG goku is the second strongest form of goku only being beaten by SSGSS goku. If your trying to play him like one of the ssj ki spam variants then of course that isn't going to work for you. He is a melee character and damn good at it. He is one of the few preset characters I can regularly beat custom characters with.
dbxv,3d9nfk,Kelborne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"I find that he's stronger than Ssgss Goku. I think all the gods can beat customs too. His stat box might look bigger than ssg, but in game they look identical at max level. Also, ssgss only has his zsoul going for him. God Gokus Zsoul can tip the scales."

dbxv,3d9nfk,Xentrik,3,Thu Jul 16 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"How are you playing him? His stats are leaned more toward melee combat and his skills look like they're meant to be follow up attacks opposed to being used whenever. I feel that he's a good pick against most of the original characters, but if you're comparing him to a CaC then he isn't the best pick. And at least he isn't vegeta. The only good Vegeta is SS4, but he's not available for me T-T."
dbxv,3d9nfk,NekoFuzion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"Ssj4 Vegeta is ok. Halo Vegeta is probably in the top 5 strongest characters and ssgss Vegeta has some nice combos. His ultimate even stuns and has a crazy hitbox. Halo Vegeta has super armor, reduced damage, increased speed, ki, and stamina recover. Plus strength."

dbxv,3d9nfk,Xentrik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:06 2015 UTC,I think the best Goku in this game is Goku SSJ3.
dbxv,3d9nfk,WeedHumpster,2,Tue Jul 14 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"So, if I get this right, and I might be wrong. But it sounds like you want SSG Goku to be able to spam ki like his SSJ presets? As /u/NekoFuzion said, he's entirely meant to be played melee, and using your skills as follow up to it all for combos."
dbxv,3d9nfk,WeedHumpster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"What I meant is, considering SSJ God Goku is one of his most powerful forms, I believe his abilities should be equally powerful."
dbxv,3d9nfk,WeedHumpster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"Would be pretty imbalanced if he was equally strong in everything, though"
dbxv,3d9nfk,NekoFuzion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I meant equally strong in everything, not equally overpowered in everything."
dbxv,3d9nfk,dopeminebeats,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"True, true. Though that would probably just make him weaker honestly."
dbxv,3d9nfk,NekoFuzion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:12:21 2015 UTC,I personally like SSJ4 Goku the most. I dont use a lot of ki when I play so he's perfect for me
dbxv,3d9nfk,dopeminebeats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:38 2015 UTC,Ssgss goku is the best

dbxv,3d9nfk,DayVGaming,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I never heard that before, but yeah I think ssg goku should be the best right? Turning ss3 for goku is cool and all but turning super saiyan as a melee fighter is kind of like a flaw right?"

dbxv,3d71bw,Elevas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:12:55 2015 UTC,Just try to unlock super electric strike from the androids. It's really useful and will separate Frieza from Goku.   Once u unlock SS and SS2 u can spam super electric strike and pretty much beat any mission.
dbxv,3d71bw,Raystacksem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can.   However some things will only drop for you if you are the one who lands the killing blow (dragon balls on time travellers for sure, not sure if its the same for skills)"

dbxv,3d7dwx,NekoFuzion,3,Tue Jul 14 02:29:45 2015 UTC,Stop them from getting Pose H. Use Hyper Drain to drain both Ki and Stamina. Endure the lengthy battle.
dbxv,3d7dwx,tweuep,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:39:17 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about hyper drain. I thought it was blegh because it drains less stamina but I see how it can be usefull now. What if they choose a big map? Is there a way around that or do I just have to pray they forget about the pose?
dbxv,3d7dwx,tweuep,2,Tue Jul 14 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"If they choose a big map and you fail to get to them before they get the pose off, avoid them until the pose runs out. Keep peppering them with basic ki strikes."

dbxv,3d7dwx,DayVGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:02:57 2015 UTC,"Its not as good on other races. You still lose health while its in affect. The reason people carry it on a male Majin is because they have the highest health in the game, and beast defence at max stamina. The Z soul further powers up their defence at max ki so with the pose they can pretty much stand there and take 5 ultimate attacks."
dbxv,3d7d9j,marniconuke,2,Tue Jul 14 02:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's 10. You wanna use AoE attacks to beat them and keep your distance while you recharge your ki. If you can't beat them then just grind your levels til you can beat them.
dbxv,3d7d9j,CockSnoot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:21:34 2015 UTC,You have to keep an eye on the original ones and try to only target them. After the originals are killed the clones stop spawning.

dbxv,3d12im,Elevas,5,Sun Jul 12 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"Items in saved load outs count as being ""equipped"" to that character. So if you have the Vegeta Suit saved in your first character's preset load outs, then it'll be unavailable to your other characters.   The easiest work around is to just use one set of armor per character, and just make the moves different in the load outs. The nice thing is that you don't need multiple sets of armor for different load outs on the same character.  Hopefully that helps"
dbxv,3d12im,FalcoCreed,2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the most detailed answer I've received, as frustrating as the answer may be. I wanted to keep a few presets set to my saiyan to cycle through on the character select screen to make him feel more canonical (since the canonical ones all have quite a few), just in case that explains my madness. :P  At least there're a few sets I can straight up re-purchase like raditz's, turles', ginyu white's and cooler's battalion's that I already have spare.

dbxv,3cu7za,WeedHumpster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:15:25 2015 UTC,Yeah there is the two different ones but the main way SS is used is for spamming ki ults. If you're going to be a striker you probably want more focus on stamina and strike supers.

My equipment is a full set of any of the +5 basicattack +5 Strike +5 Stamina gear.  My zoul fluctuates, but typically I am using Whis, you are stepping in Poo to keep my opposition's Stamina down so I can get easy combo's in early, otherwise I like You can be my first Victim for the Ki buff and Damage reduction.  I like tall Friezas because they are faster than anything other than small male saiyans and other Friezas even when at max height.  That being said I could seeing bumping down to the 2nd tallest.    For Skills I am running Phantom Fist (evasion), Evil Rise Strike (quick, easy damage), Pearl Flash(quick approach, fucks with opponents timing) and Deadly Dance(good combo ender, useful if you think they will be able to escape an infinite soon)  For my ultimates I run Victory Rush and Spirit Sword, though I could easily see switching out one for Justice Combination.  My evasive has changed a lot, but I am a fan of Angry Shout (quickly build Ki if needed in addition to evading) and Final Pose (damage buff).

dbxv,3cjfyz,Shotten,5,Wed Jul 8 11:31:09 2015 UTC,"Alrighty lets say you want a melee build with the moves you have. Sledgehammer is pretty good its not great but it's good for finishing combos and after using vanish moves like instant transmission and the normal vanish that takes stamina. You use those when they're wailing on you then use sledgehammer to take em out of the sky. Orion combo is the same. Does good damage and great for combo finishers and vanishing. I hear god breaker is good is you can use it well since it stops your opponent from attacking and you can start dealing damage to him then. All clear takes a bit but it does good damage and sends em spinning. Now for kaioken x20, it gives the same damage and speed bonus as kaioken x3 but allows you to vanish without taking away stamina bars but drains your stamina quicker than x3. To me it's not worth it. Try to get x3 because like I said same speed and damage bonus but drains slower. It's good with a decent amount of stamina. I like to use just normal Kaioken because it takes away stamina the slowest. The buffs aren't as good but I prefer more kaioken time over more damage for a shorter time. It works really well with high stamina because you won't have to use things like Rise To Action and Super Drain. Things that use ki to refill your stamina a couple bars.  For ki builds you can pretty much use anything when it comes to PvE. Just see what moves do the most damage. But lets go over the moves anyways. Kamehameha and galick gun are pretty much the same except galick gun takes less time to fire but does less damage. So if you want a move that shoots fast go with galick gun. If you want more damage then kamehameha.Destruco Disk is alright in PvE but worthless in PvP since it is hard to hit sometimes and doesn't have a great pay off. Recoome Eraser Gun is good for PvE cause it does lots of damage but takes a while so it's not good for PvP. I find energy shot useless since the damage is barely there. Shine shot is also alright nothing too great nothing too bad. I've never used evil eyes so no idea. Masenko again good for PvE but it's hard to hit in PvP. So the overall thing with PvE is anything is alright or good because AI is dumb. But for PvP you want something fast and that does decent damage.  If you have any questions feel free to ask and if you're on Xbox One you can send me a message(XFaded SoldierX) and I can help you with PQs. Good luck and be sure to try out any new moved you get because you never know when a move will help your move set."

dbxv,3c4oo2,CountDarth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:00:28 2015 UTC,Increasing friendship is slow to be honest. If you want it to go a little faster just bring him with you on every PQ and talk to him after each. Sometimes you might get the next mentor quest right after talking to him
dbxv,3c4oo2,CountDarth,2,Sun Jul 5 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"18 has some fairly unique moves that feel weird but can be pretty fun.  Or go Gohan & Videl if you like strike supers.  Depending on your level though, you may want to consider waiting till level 70 and unlocking Goku."

I can't imagine trying to get to lvl 99 without the quests from it. The other dlc packs are debatable. The only useful skills (in my opinion) from them are Yamcha and Pan'd ultimates."
dbxv,3c3fp7,2Lazy4RealName,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:34:53 2015 UTC,Cheers dude! I think I'll pick up the lot and hype myself for Pack 3 by playing through the others first
dbxv,3c1afk,supamesican,2,Fri Jul 3 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"They have the 2nd best ki blast stat in the game, behind human females. Ki spam is the best choice for them due to having access to super vegeta/saiyan.   Stats should be focused towards Ki blast, then overall ki (50 ki will get you 6 bars, which is a good amount since you can spam ults and just use max charge when you get low). After that I would focus on health since F Saiyans are squishy as far as health goes."
dbxv,3c1afk,Pandabarrel,2,Fri Jul 3 22:42:39 2015 UTC,Which is better? SSJ or SV? I know the 2 on both of them is a no because of energy drain but is the boost from SV over SSJ worth the extra energy usage?
dbxv,3c1afk,dieuleilomo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"TBH no. SS reduces damage from ALL attacks by 10%. SV reduces damage from ki based attacks by 10%. The reason more people prefer SV is because it bumps up ki based attacks over strikes, but only by like 2%...  Energy consumption is the same between SS/SV."
dbxv,3c1afk,raella69,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:16:24 2015 UTC,The energy consumption is not the same.
dbxv,3c1afk,siyo4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:19:54 2015 UTC,Only between SS2 and SV2.
dbxv,3c1afk,raella69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:41 2015 UTC,SV2 has SSJ's level of consumption.
dbxv,3c1afk,raella69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"I use SSV on my Female Saiyan, and if I'm doing something I know is quite hard I may go with Super Vegeta 2. But also only if I'm playing with my friend."
dbxv,3c1afk,siyo4,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, so does sv2 not use as much energy as ssj2? Hmm I'll keep that in mind then. Thanks."
dbxv,3c1afk,Kingdarkshadow,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:34:28 2015 UTC,It uses more.
dbxv,3c1afk,raella69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:06:05 2015 UTC,SSJ gives 2% attack damage and strike damage and 1% ki blast and super SV gives 2% ki blast and super and 1% damage and strike damage  they both reduce 10% damage you would take
dbxv,3c1afk,raella69,2,Sat Jul 4 13:58:16 2015 UTC,"I would advise against focusing on health as the other guy stated- I find it better to dump more points in stamina and focus on being good at not getting hit. Learn2afterimage.  But yeah, no points in strike supers, max ki supers, max stamina, and ki if you have all of the DLC. I don't think you can max three stars without the DLC unfortunately. If you have any leftovers dump them in basic attack so you can have a little oomph when you need to knock heads."
dbxv,3bzkyt,SaiyanSquad,15,Fri Jul 3 12:47:31 2015 UTC,I honestly doubt a sub with 4k subscribers will go private. It will just be a headache for the users
dbxv,3bzkyt,IAmALizardOverlord,-6,Fri Jul 3 13:25:21 2015 UTC,There were some with 81k that went private. /r/AskReddit being one...
dbxv,3bzkyt,IAmALizardOverlord,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:32 2015 UTC,81k is way more than 4k. /r/AskReddit is a default so that's why they shut down
dbxv,3bzkyt,teamherosquad,10,Fri Jul 3 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"The point of the subs going private is to make the admins realize that the content comes from the community. If dbxv went down No one would notice. (except us, obviously)"
dbxv,3bzkyt,teamherosquad,-7,Fri Jul 3 17:04:33 2015 UTC,That's still 4k subscribers. Even the smaller subs going private could impact greatly. Those numbers could add up.
dbxv,3bzkyt,sargentsuicide,3,Fri Jul 3 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"They don't add up. No one on reddit sees this sub unless they come looking for it, the only people it would affect are the subscribers. whereas the big subs are default and actually what drive the website by bringing in millions of users."
dbxv,3bzkyt,indigoreality,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:01:44 2015 UTC,I meant a lot of the smaller ones such as this one. I do see your point. I'm glad to hear. I've lost a lot of the subs I subscribe to and didn't want to lose this one as well. Thanks for reassuring me. :)
dbxv,3bzkyt,psychospacecow,3,Fri Jul 3 19:55:07 2015 UTC,Please god no. This is just screwing users over.
dbxv,3bzkyt,ragadavi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:39:06 2015 UTC,Some of the other subs are already public again. Goes to show how much impact our sub would even have. It's too niche.

dbxv,3c0p90,LaughingFoxx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"I HATE PvP with custom created characters. They have way too many advantages over normal characters.   CaC's will hit 2-4x as hard as any roster character Roster characters don't seem to have all racial perks? (Frieza fires a regular ki blast rather than a stunning ki blast?) Point distribution for roster characters aren't min/max'd like CaC's, so roster characters are always gimped in comparison   I was fighting a male Majin, fattest/tallest and he must've been using Broly's Overflowing Z-Soul (max ki = higher def) because every punch I landed with SSGSS Goku did about 1 pixel worth of damage to him. Even though I hit him 3x as often, he still beat me THROUGH SHEER ATTRITION. IMO there's simply never a reason to use a roster character over a CaC unless you just want to use Goku and spam Super God Fist until you deck them in their IMBA snoz."
