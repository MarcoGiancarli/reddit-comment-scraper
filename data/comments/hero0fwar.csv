Just make sure you give a source and artists name.  I'll see about finding an acceptable site list and adding it to the page soon.

It starts off a little quirky, but it's something that grows on you quickly.  If you want to give a single episode a shot, try one from the middle of seasons 2, 3, or 4. The writers have a little better idea of what they want to do with the show at that point."

We got about 45 minutes into the lesson and playing that one string at various rhythms, and then I finally told them the song they were learning: the horn part from Gon' Give It to Ya.
