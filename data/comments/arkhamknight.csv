What I do is ease off the acceleration around corners and press the button to drift. Don't let up all the way, just a little. Make sure to use the afterburner on the straightaways. I focus my immobilizer on the apc itself while taking out the support vehicles by doing the slide into them."
arkhamknight,3dwdn6,FluidicMonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"I think its just a matter of getting better at driving then. I usually don't have any issue keeping up with them unless I'm knocked into a ditch, etc. Even then, I think they slow down a little and let you catch up.  You can focus on the primary APC and try to ignore the support APCs, but usually those support vehicles get super annoying and shoot you right before you get a lock. So try to eliminate those support APCs with the sideswipes, boost ram, or immobilizer missile. Then when its down to you and the primary APC, just keep following and shooting it."

But, the worst part of the Batmobile sequences were these unnecessarily frustrating and pointless races.   They didn't even have feature a coherent plot point.

arkhamknight,3du440,LuminiferousEthan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:00 2015 UTC,Actually every time I failed it changed. And sometimes there were more or less crushers. Could be a glitch (gee...in this game?) but really-I sat and watched and the patterns would change. Every time different ones in different areas would come down...and different numbers of them. And sometimes I would watch (because I had failed) and drive through only for a new one to come down.
arkhamknight,3du440,OptimumCorridor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"Not the biggest fan of the races, but that part most certainly does have a pattern."
arkhamknight,3du440,surged_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:26 2015 UTC,On the final lap of the race before final exam every time I failed on the final portion (the slamming blocks) there was a different area the blocks would come down. And there were a few times since I had failed I say and watched...drove the pattern that had come down for the past minute and suddenly a new one came down. Also in that part different numbers would come down. Once only three did. Once six. It was different every time. So it isn't like the rest of the race.   Also on the blade polls that popped up...there was a lack of pattern...or at least discernible pattern. It may have been where if you watched for a minute or more it repeated...but one time it would be first and third...or second and then third. Or first and second.   On a level like that if there is a pattern you are testing skill (especially at the speeds of the race.) If there is not a recognizable pattern you are testing luck...and that is poor level design.

arkhamknight,3dt0ot,leonardofelin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:07:25 2015 UTC,"I did it in the first Batman AR Challenge - Reason: if combo breaks, it'll end anyway.  I barely use counters. I mainly jump over foes. Jump, jump, jump, jump... it'll give time to think your next move. Remember: KEEP JUMPING!  Make a list of these and mark the ones you've completed. It helps a lot - you'll retry some times and you'll probably lose track without the list.  Main thing here is to get some moves out of the way as soon as possible, especially those that leave you exposed to attack. I always start out like this:  01 - Batclaw Slam - PS4: L2+Triangle, Square // Xbox: LT+Y, X  02 - Counter - PS4: Triangle // Xbox: Y  03 - Super Stun - PS4: Circle, Circle, Circle // Xbox: B, B, B  04 - Aerial Juggle - PS4: Circle, Circle, Circle, Square // Xbox: B, B, B, X  05 - Aerial Attack - PS4: Circle, X, X // Xbox: B, A, A  It's likely that while doing those, you also did:  06 - Strike - PS4: Square // Xbox: X  07 - Redirect (Jump) - PS4: Left Stick+X, X // Xbox: Left Stick+A, A  Now, mix in some gadgets:  08 - Quick Electrical Charge - PS4: L2+Circle // Xbox: LT+B  09 - Quick Batarang - PS4: L2 // Xbox: LT  10 - Quick Explosive Gel - PS4: L2+Square // Xbox: LT+X  Keep jumping over enemies and punching here and there to build up your combo meter. Whenever it fills up (flashing yellow), use one of these:  11 - Special Combo Takedown - PS4: Circle+Triangle // Xbox: B+Y  12 - Special Combo Disarm and Destroy - PS4: Square+Triangle // Xbox: X+Y  13 - Special Combo Remote Electrical Charge - PS4: Hold L2+Circle // Xbox: Hold LT+B  14 - Special Combo Batarang - PS4: Hold L2 // Xbox: Hold LT  15 - Special Combo Explosive Gel - PS4: Hold L2+Square // Xbox: Hold LT+X  16 - Special Combo Batclaw - PS4: Hold L2+Triangle // Xbox: Hold LT+Y  17 - Special Combo Multi Ground Takedown - PS4: X+Circle // Xbox: A+B  Some extra moves you can use:  18 - Cape Stun - PS4: Circle // Xbox: B  19 - Batclaw Super Stun - PS4: L2+Triangle, Circle // Xbox: LT+Y, B  20 - Charged Super Stun - PS4: Hold Circle // Xbox: Hold B  Avoid using these, unless you're really comfortable with them:  21 - Beat Down - PS4: Circle, Square, Square, Square // Xbox: B, X, X, X  22 - Ground Takedown - PS4: L2+Triangle // Xbox: LT+Y  23 - Blade Dodge Takedown - PS4: Left Stick, Hold & Release Triangle // Xbox: Left Stick, Hold & Release Y  24 - Combat Pick Up - PS4: R2+Circle // Xbox: RT+B  JUMP, JUMP, JUMP, JUMP. It'll change the way you play this game - you'll hit x100s combo easily without being awesome at the combat (that's me)."

arkhamknight,3do28w,jh820439,2,Sat Jul 18 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"There's actually a simple trick to doing the GCPD one when you get to it. There is an alleyway next to the main gate entrance covered by a large wooden panel. Once the massive tank fight starts, just go into the alley and aim at the entrance. You create a killbox. You hack a bunch of drones and keep killing ones that come up to you.   Once the number gets manageable, you just go out and kill the rest. Really helped me maintain my sanity the first time I went through the game on hard, because I was close to rage chucking my controller.   With regards to the Ivy graveyard mission, everyone else's advice is pretty much on point. I personally used a lot of the hacking ability, I felt it bought me more breathing room than the missile barrage."

I get battle-mode might not not be the everybody's favorite but I loved playing Mech games as a kid, so battle mode easily translates for me. The driving does take some getting used to, especially since BRAKE is actually Square(PS4) and not Left Trigger as in typical racing games.  Beside that the biggest tip I have is to just decelerate when making turns, and be gentle with the steering, only sharp turns really require the Throttle/Brake application to initiate a drift. Even then the slides are hard to predict as they are not progressive, kind of like what you would get in Mario Kart.   I drive withe the camera right behind the Batmobile as the farthest away one sits too low and makes navigating tight obstacles harder. The bumper can to me is pretty much useless since it sits too low as well.  But I love the Batmobile, definietly a great addition to the game."

When it's faster to glide than drive,  just glide.   I had the same thought, so I didn't upgrade the car AT ALL. But later in the gsme (spoilers) I was fucked because you need the car in all the later boss fights! So I have to agree in some way it's annoying."
arkhamknight,3dlnqp,Geekos,0,Fri Jul 17 09:29:05 2015 UTC,"LOL, me too. I focused on upgrading everything else but the car."
arkhamknight,3dlnqp,mukhlisz,5,Fri Jul 17 16:08:56 2015 UTC,but surely you must enjoy the countless hours of fighting those drone tanks right? they're like super fun right?
arkhamknight,3dlnqp,jinx819,2,Fri Jul 17 08:36:57 2015 UTC,The missile launcher drones are the worst.
arkhamknight,3dlnqp,DontcallmeGeorge,2,Fri Jul 17 16:13:07 2015 UTC,I did like what one reviewer said about the game. They should have stuck to the rule of 3. Use the damn thing for no more than 3 missions and it would have been great. There is just too much and I would rather have a non-tank batmobile.   I'm guessing that they will make another one that is just a Batwing fight simulator for 90% of the game with 10% Batmobile action.

arkhamknight,3dl7ok,MagusTobias,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"It's deceptively easy; basically, as said before, you're gonna have to restart, but try to do as many hack takedowns (like with the electric floor panels, and distract/scare functions with follow-up takedowns) as you can. They are cumulative throughout the playthrough, and the tutorial one counts for the 15 you need. A pain in the ass, but it can be done as long as you're patient when you need to be and assertive when the opportunity is there."
arkhamknight,3dl7ok,MagusTobias,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:40:23 2015 UTC,I was able to do accomplish this a few hours ago. I didn't realize the hacking had two variations. The one at ghost ship was a big help. I was able to take down 5 at once with the gas!
arkhamknight,3dkmnp,FalconLorenzo,5,Fri Jul 17 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"From memory, the waypoint area is to assist you in finding the burning bat symbol. Should be on a nearby rooftop, not necessarily the one you're standing on. But hey, I could be wrong!"

arkhamknight,3dhujl,monsimons,2,Thu Jul 16 11:55:23 2015 UTC,On PC a similar issue happens. Whenever I try to talk toward the camera Batman turns around and starts walking backwards toward the camera.
arkhamknight,3dhujl,OmegaDN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"Oh, so it's the same on PC I very well remember this wasn't the case with Asylum and City. Will test it later. I guess if it is an Arkham Knight issue I'll be heading to the petition forums."
arkhamknight,3dhujl,thuglife2e,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:57 2015 UTC,I had City on 360 and you could do this. I also noticed what you mentioned in Knight and turned the camera assist off. I'm pretty sure they changed it into that and I don't it either.   Anyway to find out what camera assist does? What are the petition forms?
arkhamknight,3dhujl,OptimumCorridor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"I still don't know what camera assist does. Will experiment later. As for the petition forums, I was joking and referring to the petition about getting back challenge maps. I guess I'll write in the wbcommunity forums about the camera but I doubt they will fix it, it's probably by design."
arkhamknight,3dh36d,Samurai56M,7,Thu Jul 16 05:38:10 2015 UTC,"There's a power winch behind on the ceiling, attach to that and it will charge your missiles to full. Start using the missiles instead of shooting, one for each question mark that lights up"
arkhamknight,3dh36d,foofan92,3,Thu Jul 16 05:54:41 2015 UTC,"It's definitely this. I tried five times before giving up, then drove off. I was driving to find the final Rule the Roads when I spotted green on the road behind the button used to activate it. I looked up and saw it was a winch point.  Unlimited missile power. Much easier."
arkhamknight,3dh36d,acelister,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:00:24 2015 UTC,"another part of this tip is to be sure to keep it attached while you're aiming the cannon behind you, otherwise the charge will go away."
arkhamknight,3dh36d,versak,5,Thu Jul 16 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"I... I uhh, did this one wrong apparently.  Realizing I could never shoot the batmobile's gun fast enough, I hopped out and completed this one with the multi batarang.  Took maybe three tries.  Never saw the power up winch point, but good to know!"
arkhamknight,3dh36d,magabzdy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:05 2015 UTC,"To me, that is more Batman than any other way of attempting it"
arkhamknight,3dh36d,tropicalapple,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:57 2015 UTC,I believe that's the one where you need to use the missile salvo to get the last round.
arkhamknight,3dh36d,Shinobiolium,3,Thu Jul 16 05:45:52 2015 UTC,I left him to starve to death in his hidey hole. He won't hurt anyone down there.
arkhamknight,3dh36d,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:02 2015 UTC,I was stuck on that one for a while too. Here's how I did it. Fill up your car meter by destroying random cars until you can unleash the missiles.   Just shoot the first couple of question marks with your gun and when you need to hit m all. Unleash the missiles and shoot the few that remain.
arkhamknight,3dh36d,Imrolini,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"I remember in Arkham City someone once commented on the Riddler being the main antagonist due to the amount of effort Batman had to go through to apprehend him, this game is similar that way. The Riddler is annoying, but not to be taken lightly."

arkhamknight,3dh36d,115128,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"The questions marks lead you to a circular mark on a wall. Shoot this mark with the batmobile and it'll break apart the wall, inside is where the trophy sits. :-)"
arkhamknight,3dh36d,TheLocalEwok,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"Jump off the batmobile, go to your left and enter the station. Use the Hacking device to open the door from inside.  After this one I realized that whenever you'd need to go all the way around (like in the bridge), just jump off the car, grapple up and call the car back. much easier than going all the way around."
arkhamknight,3dhkk5,DontcallmeGeorge,3,Thu Jul 16 09:33:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're just way badass at being Batman :) I felt the same way at first too, even on Knightmare. But when I thought about it, playing through City 10+ times trained me pretty well to deal with Knight."
arkhamknight,3dhkk5,delerioso,2,Thu Jul 16 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I feel way too OP at this game too. Even on Knightmare. However, I never played any of the previous games. My buddy just told me all I needed to know was Joker died. LOVED THE GAME!!!  But, I will say that I played Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor a gazillion times. And it took a great deal of it's gameplay from the Arkham games. Even though Arkham isn't as forgiving as Mordor with the combat"
arkhamknight,3dhkk5,Thunderkick72,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:15 2015 UTC,"I figured out how to make the game crazy hard. BLINDFOLDED! JK I started a new game on hard (as far as it goes for a regular new game) and committed to zero upgrades. At that point you basically have to do each fight near perfect since the Batmobile can take only about 4 hits, two gunshots is doom, and a brawl is over in about five hits. Even with the warning GFX from enemies you'll be hard pressed to survive."
arkhamknight,3dhkk5,delerioso,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:51 2015 UTC,"Only talking about combat mode: I def feel they changed it a lot. City was better in my opinion. I loved the cracking noises when you were done with someone, the free flow was much more slow mo, less annoyances (people charging, grabs, brutes) I feel they sacrificed the combat for the bat mobile combat."
arkhamknight,3dhkk5,thuglife2e,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:16:33 2015 UTC,"Agree 100% It's now filled with gimmicks like blade dodges, weapon grabs etc etc. I was great at combat in city but now there's 40 combos and endless button pushes just to take down thugs. Plus the quick throw bat claw shit"

arkhamknight,3dexvp,rayjay77,8,Wed Jul 15 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"I loved it, it was everything i wanted. People these days hold new games to this impeccable standard and are disappointed when it's not an 11/10 games.  If it wasn't for the batmobile it would have been arkham city 2.0, and everyone would have complained. We got shiny new toys and cool AR missions, if you don't like it then play another game. It was as good as it can reasonably expected."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,jh820439,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"everybody is entitled to their opinion. Glad you liked it but i disagree.. How can you say if it wasn't for the batmobile it would have been arkham 2.0 The batmobile is featured in at least 50% of the game.. almost every level involved the batmobile in some way, and almost every boss battle involved fighting drones, i dunno i guess i expected more.. I am pretty sure i spent more time in the batmobile then i did on foot, and not by choice.."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,Hillel1963,0,Wed Jul 15 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"I hated the Batmobile segments, which I found repetitive, and found the Riddler's racing trials rather silly.  Why would the Riddler be interested in testing Batman's driving ability?  It would have been a better game had the Batmobile been in 5-10% of the action instead of 50% or more."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,TiggersJaw,3,Thu Jul 16 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"I've been a huge Batman fan all my life. I collect the comics, figures movies, all nine yards. Hell, I even have two boxed sets of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Maybe I'm a little biased, but the only problem I had with the game was the identity of the Arkham Knight. I feel like combat was better, the missions were well played out, the Batmobile chases were better than a lot of Hollywood's car chases, and gliding really felt like, well, Batman. If you don't like the Batmobile so much, try gliding more. But rocksteady spent a ton of time on the Batmobile, of course they want you to use it, and you can't say it isn't necessary in a game of this size. The map itself is 5x the size of Arkham City. The Batgirl dlc is actually decent, and the Harley Quinn and Red Hood dlcs are so short because they're free. I just don't get why so many people are crying about this game."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,MagusTobias,2,Sun Jul 19 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna agree/disagree with all points made, but I'll say this much: the game was really short and they haven't really delivered on the DLC, but supposedly the DLC that hasn't been dated yet is going to add a lot more content than what the DLC so far has given, so there is hope yet in that regard. We'll just have to wait and see."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,Warden_lefae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"Overall I enjoyed it, despite not being able to get 5 of the Riddler trophies. I kinda enjoyed the Batmobile missions.  But I only paid for the game it self, not the season pass. I have to really love a game to pay for the doc, and not many can hit that mark."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,VaguestCargo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"I sorta get what you mean. I really loved the game. Loved the batmobile. The drones. The stealthy missions. All of it. The story was hit or miss, but over all I was really impressed and am gonna be firing up the Story+ mode asap.  That said, I was really bummed out by the dlc. Yeah, it was MAYBE 30 min of content. Barbara's skin looks great and I love switching between her and Tim. Fighting Joker was cool too and that level (a busted up amusement park on an oil rig!?!?!?) was sooooo awesome. But it was over in a flash. I'll go back and explore some, but yes, as for first DLC it was pretty halfass.  I wish there were a way to explore gotham as the other characters. That'd improve the experience a tiny bit for me."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,Hillel1963,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"I felt underwhelmed by the whole game, including the graphics which looked like a last generation console game.   And 30 FPS?  What's up with that?  It's a shame because Arkham Asylum and Arkham City were fantastic - among my favorite games."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,Hillel1963,0,Thu Jul 16 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree there. I thought the graphics were amazing, although i wish it stopped raining for a bit or at least had different weather patterns or something. The rain got old. What did you play it on? I played on ps4."
arkhamknight,3dexvp,Hillel1963,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you had a different experience.   I played it on am Alienware PC (with all the bells and whistles) and the graphics were just not up to par.  From what I'm hearing the console versions were much more polished than the PC version.     Ah well, it's back to Witcher 3, (60 FPS+) until they patch Arkham Knight."
arkhamknight,3dcm9t,BurningCityscape,3,Wed Jul 15 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I rescued Ryder from the Deacon, and the Deacon is in the GCPD lockup... But Ryder is still on the altar by Lady Gotham, the Deacon looking out over where you fight all those guys. It's creepy."

arkhamknight,3dcm9t,Hypo_Badger,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:12 2015 UTC,No and I went through the rest of the game without ever seeing them again.

arkhamknight,3dcus1,Cooperthegreat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:23:28 2015 UTC,I had that happen tonight on ps4. I was GCPD. It's just a glitch.
arkhamknight,3dcus1,Warden_lefae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:07 2015 UTC,I am experiencing this since the update as well.  Usually doing a mission or leaving an area fixes it.  Still weird.  It's like Batman wants to turn and look at me to express his disappointment in me for not being able to use all 15 combat moves in one free flow combat.
arkhamknight,3dchhb,ManjeetSidhu,3,Wed Jul 15 04:49:32 2015 UTC,The informants are random. Just glide over the streets with your detective vision on and look for the green.

arkhamknight,3dc0ou,piemanpm,2,Wed Jul 15 02:25:48 2015 UTC,"Check youtube videos on it; the best advice I got was to pick 15 of the 26 moves (27 including batmobile takedown) that you are comfortable with doing in combat, jot them down on a piece of paper or your phone, do the AR challenge with Nightwing (because of thr large number of basic enemies on-screen at the start), and whenever you need to or there's a brief pause (like doing the a special takedown that lasts a few seconds) pause the game and check your note as to what ones you haven't and have done. Be careful with jumping, cape stuns, and gadget use, because it's very easy to make a mistake and end your combo by missing target or not staying ""in"" the combo, especially by jumping. Unless you're really used to keyboard and mouse controls and they're intuitive to you, use a good controller. It's do-able, but don't feel bad or get overly frustrated; I'm literally on the last 2 Achievements for the game (the hidden and Reclaim your City ones), and this one was literally the last one I did before starting New Game Plus, and it took me 2 to 3 days to get it. (I'm not especially gifted at the combat system, and much prefer to variation of it in Origins', so no worries. You CAN do it. Just be patient, practice, and restart the challenge if you mess up after the second wave with riot shielders show up.)"
arkhamknight,3dc0ou,MagusTobias,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:59:47 2015 UTC,i got it by accident during a ar mission with azrael.
arkhamknight,3dc0ou,Thewarohund,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"I have it, but I use the controller on pc.  Used to swapping up my moves from past batman games on their beatemup challenges.  Advice?  Be methodical, slowly work your way through every move you know and don't go for ground takedowns unless you are certain you have the time.  Evade a lot.  Mix a punch between moves to keep your combo alive.  If you stop a beatdown to counter, don't resume it more than twice.  The third attempt to resume always breaks my combo for some reason.  Review the moves abd remember to use ones you may not use very often (superstun?)"
arkhamknight,3deki5,rKadeUK,2,Wed Jul 15 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone unboxed their own copies weeks ago, so this isn't doing much for me."

arkhamknight,3dcvqt,washednblood,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was really dissapointed with them both, although at least  the red hood dlc had the gunplay.  These are my first introduction to dlc and I really since my switch from 360 and I hope they are not all this short."

It's an open, albeit small, world where you can choose a few times the order in which you want to progress. There are collectibles to find and Spoiler. Plus it is generally more interesting than Harley's and has a few scripted sequences, if I can call them that.  EDIT: how do you make a spoiler here?"

arkhamknight,3davmy,Chezni19,2,Sun Jul 19 05:01:21 2015 UTC,Yes you will miss a very important plot point. I didn't play Asylum so I missed that but there's a major point in city.   To be honest I would wait if knight comes down in price. The batman stuff is good but I hated nearly everything about the batmobile. There's also some really crappy payoffs.   Best hoping for a remastered city not that I have reason to believe that will happen. That game was unreal. I missed origins but despite mixed reactions it was more of same as city which imo is not a bad thing at all.

You have to successfully counter them 3 or 4 times in a row before they are knocked out.  Try leaving them for last during predator areas to avoid being noticed and shot by other thugs since it takes a little time.  Or they may want you to use an environmental takedown. I'm don't exactly remember the area you are talking about, but you run into more of the chain gun guys during the game."

arkhamknight,3d96rz,faramir20,7,Tue Jul 14 14:21:19 2015 UTC,It easy to figure it out during gameplay since after some time there're some flashback with Todd as Robin. Also announcing Red Hood dlc didn't help to keep it a secret.
arkhamknight,3d96rz,casualtroublemaker,4,Tue Jul 14 14:25:55 2015 UTC,When they announced red hood DLC I eliminated Jason as the Arkham Knight. I was under the impression it could be Bats and Talia's son.

arkhamknight,3d96rz,CrustyJugglerUK,3,Mon Jul 20 11:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yes.  But if it's any consolation, the real ""meat"" of what makes this game so great has little to do with Arkham Knight. This is a Batman/Scarecrow story through and through.  There's an underlying theme about the cost of Batman's war and that's why Jason Todd was shoehorned in to the plot, to drive that theme home in a big way."
arkhamknight,3d96rz,alexstoneisdead,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is pretty old hat for a batman story now. I actually think the Arkham knight story was the weakest part of the game. It just feels so tacked on..."

I'm not sure if it switched after I beat the game but at some point before I started doing riddler stuff (final most wanted) I realized the car had turned black :P   I'm excited tho for alternate skins didn't kno they were available!

You keep buying them, they'll keep ripping you off with minor DLC they pulled from the finished product to sell you at a later date for a horrible price.    No offense...but I don't feel bad for any of you that buy season passes and get ripped off.  It's always a ripoff...but if they won't tell you everything that is in it right from the beginning....bend over and prepare to have your anus pounded into oblivion."

arkhamknight,3d92xq,xMostlyHarmless,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"All I want is the Beyond skin and the '66 Batmobile. I'm on Xbox so I guess I'll just have to wait.  I agree that all the Pre-Order content should be unlocked for Season Pass holders. We paid extra for the content, and this content already exists.... why do I have to wait for it?  Sure, make the people who want to buy a la carte wait, but to make the people who paid wait just doesn't make any sense.  Love the game, as I did the others (even Origins), but this is disappointing."

arkhamknight,3d6ra5,Thewarohund,6,Mon Jul 13 23:50:12 2015 UTC,cause they want you to see the joker kill Jason.
arkhamknight,3d6ra5,Tre2,-2,Tue Jul 14 00:00:28 2015 UTC,No it happens even if you enter the container. You see Robin running out to take on the Arkham Knight. And batman stays in the container. Then joker shows up and shows how he kills Jason. After that you get to choose again to go back in the container or betray robin.  If you go back in the container after a few seconds joker shows up again and opens the container and again(not showing the Jason scene this time) you get to choose the container or betray robin.  It basically forces you to betray robin to continue to story.   I really wished that part would be a choice. Maybe Robin would get in trouble if you stay in the container and Alfred frees you after all.   I hate it when games do that. Making it seem like you have choice when you really don't.
arkhamknight,3d6ra5,rooroo999,2,Tue Jul 14 01:41:18 2015 UTC,"I did it several times, after a bunch of times going in the container, I went in and batman shoved him in anyway. Might have misclicked something, but all I pressed was space as far as I know."

Continuing on, completing 5 more of the ""Most Wanted"" missions will unlock the ability to activate ""phase 2"". These 5 missions can be any side quests in the wheel.   Then finally, should you decide to go after the Riddler trophies and get the full 100%, you will be rewarded with ""phase 3"".  So in order to unlock every possible part of the ending, yes, you will need those Riddler trophies.   Have fun! =)"

arkhamknight,3d3xzl,diesel85,3,Mon Jul 13 09:53:12 2015 UTC,"Just so you know the difference, ""phase 2"" is really just the first half of the cut scene for ""phase 3."" If you really don't want to finish all the Riddler trophies the ending is on YouTube somewhere."

I was still asked to complete 5 more to activate Knightfall Protocol.  I'm unsure as to how it determines the number of side missions required, but activating Knightfall Protocol will begin the phase 2 cutscene. After that, you will not need to restart in order to access phase 3, it continues on from where you were before activating phase 2.  Hope this helped =)"

arkhamknight,3d1bwt,DoctorSteak,2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"Generally, if they're indoors, you can sometimes use the gel on other objects that can be manipulated to move towards the breakable wall and then detonated (these are few and far between though).  But in most cases,when outdoors, you just have to use the batmobile. The trick is to call on the batmobile wherever the wall is visible (doesn't really matter how far it is, the canon will still probably hit), just scout around the area and see where you can call the batmobile and keep trying to see if the wall is still visible."
arkhamknight,3d1bwt,KDawg2600,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"Go to detective vision nearby to get a description of the wall.

Make sure you dive bomb for awhile and then adjust to fly right into it while still at a high speed."

AngryJoe posted a video that showed he had at least three crash to desktop errors in a row, textures that didn't load properly, major framerate drops, and so on.

No. Did I say game-breaking? No. I just said problems. I found the game to be playable. I just finished it yesterday, actually. I think it's still a better PC port than Unity (where every single bug I ran into was game-breaking. I have screenshots of Arno stuck in buildings). But your experience doesn't negate mine, and it doesn't negate the fact that Angry Joe, who had a better system than me, could not even get the game to run, that there are thousands of people on steam (and we can't assume all of them are trying to force the game to run on a sub-par system) reporting problems. (I recall Yahtzee and Totalbiscuit reporting problems too, and Totalbiscuit has been very open about the fact that he has a system I'd actually kill for, and I'm a pacifist.

arkhamknight,3cuoft,Lucarai,3,Sat Jul 11 07:30:21 2015 UTC,"It isn't a circle-jerk if the problems are that significant. (A circle-jerk, in my opinion, is people who are getting worked up over basically nothing and just repeating the same stuff over and over again. There is actually something going on here. Again, every single person I've talked to, with authority or in person, has experienced problems with this game on some level.)  The outcry isn't just about Arkham Knight, sure. Arkham Knight was a horrific PC port that the developers knew about months in advance and still did nothing. This followed the infamous Unity port, which followed many, many other ports. We are SICK of just getting poorly optimized ports thrown in our laps. (A good counter-example is Bethesda's Dishonored. When Dishonored was released, I was playing it on a freaking CHIPSET. [Not even a graphics card. I had just gotten into gaming at that point.] I had no stuttering, no drops, nothing. That game was so well-optimized you could play it on a system that was not designed for games and still force it to run.)  Origins was released as a buggy mess too. I recall the outcry around that one. (I also experienced only light problems with this game. No graphical problems, only having a near game-breaking problem where I kept dropping through an elevator I needed to stay in to complete the game. I finally found a spot that Batman didn't fall through and completed the game.) I've read that the game has never gotten fully patched, and the studio moved onto DLC. The fact that these guys (who aren't the same studio, I'll admit, even if this is the same series) tried to pull the PC version off the shelves entirely suggests they are trying to fix it, but they're going to get the brunt of YEARS of frustration.   It's not that we're a bunch of entitled brats who are screaming at each-other. PC players literally put thousands of dollars into our systems. (1,615 for my customized gaming laptop.) A website says I probably put somewhere between 700 to 2,000 (so let's average it out and say around 1,500 bucks since I mostly buy on Steam Sales) into my games collection, and it's not including Minecraft, Dragon Age Inquisition, The Sims, and Arkham Knight. (because I haven't run it again since Arkham Knight got bound to my library.)   This isn't something to scoff at. I put real fucking MONEY into this. I preordered this game because the Arkham series was on the list of games I'd actually pre-order. (I have a blanket pre-order ban except for: Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Dishonored, and Arkham series. Arkham just got removed. Borderlands is a 'on release' series. Everything else can wait.)  So we're upset because we paid $60 dollars for a game that, depending on who you are, what (PC) system you got (especially your graphics card), and if the gods smiled down upon you, either got you one or two graphical glitches or literally broke the game every five seconds. We're upset because this happens to us ALL THE GODDAMNED TIME. We're upset because we found out that they knew this was going to happen, and pulling the game from the shelves isn't going to stop the hate-train at this point. They have become a scapegoat, I'm going to admit it. But do they deserve it? A little. (P.S. Reddit uses the downvote for ""this adds to discussion, not ""I disagree."" Just a reminder. :))"

Batman fighting his inner demons and whatnot, ok, it's kind of cliched, but for a video game it's fine and I enjoyed.  Arkham Knight being Jason Todd was really expected from my part, but it was fine IMO.  Something in defeating the villains in the city feels less satisfactory than beating than in the Asylum. Asylum is still the best game of the series in my opinion mainly because it was so contained and it was ONE villain's plan (Joker) to do ONE thing. Every other element is kind of derived from there. This one suffer from the same problem than City, where everything is happening all at once and like...this wouldn't make any sense even in comic book logic. Also, the way all of them end up in that small little cage is...kind of disappointing. I enjoyed the evidence room, though. It gives you that sense of satisfaction as it is being filled up.  I generally disliked the Knightfall operation ending, because, as someone pointed out if the Batman returns after that happening to the Wayne Manor, NOBODY is going to believe that stuff...people will be like ""Well...that is it...Wayne faked his own death to 'protect his loved ones' and now he can continue to being Batman""."

The games are absolutely connected through the central story of The Batman and the Joker:  Origins - The Batman captures Joker and brings his to Arkham Asylum  Asylum - The Joker escapes and enacts his plan to create an army of super soldiers. In the end he inadvertently poisons himself.  City - A dying Joker is desperate for a cure, poisons Batman and sends poisoned blood to hospitals. In the end Batman synthesizes a cure, but Joker destroys it (inadvertantly) and dies as a result.  Knight - A dead joker is still within the poisoned mind of Batman, trying ever harder to break free and take control.  That's a pretty clearly directed story. Each works well on it's own, but they do connect, far beyond 'loosely'."

Who is the new batman?

arkhamknight,3cjwy1,UltravioIence,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:34:15 2015 UTC,wasnt he there to gain batmans trust and kill him? I dont remember anything about him wanting to replace him but I definitely couldve missed some details.
arkhamknight,3cjwy1,lexcess,3,Wed Jul 8 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Up until the last mission, the entire point of the ""Heir to the Cowl"" Most Wanted side missions was that Azrael was auditioning for Batman in order to take his place.   The twist at the end was that he had been brainwashed or programmed to take his place by killing him.  He was never really deprogrammed, so it stands to reason that if he were to ever escape (or be set free) that he would naturally want to take Batman's place in his absence.  Given the appearance of the bat figure at the end, I have to assume that he was somehow incorporating Scarecrow's fear toxin in to his caped crusading."
arkhamknight,3cjwy1,D-Roberts,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:29 2015 UTC,It's optional that he is imprisoned. If you just leave (or break the sword) you shake Bats hand and say you are going off to deal with the Order.  Of course the end doesn't change either way making its unlikely its him.
arkhamknight,3cjwy1,D-Roberts,2,Tue Jul 14 12:00:52 2015 UTC,I think it is Bruce at the end. When you think of both endings the only one with a new batman is the one with all the super villains away. I think if you leave one free they blow up the mansion but if they are all captured batman goes on scarier than ever because people think he should be dead.
arkhamknight,3cjwy1,UltravioIence,3,Wed Jul 8 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"I think either ending makes it pretty clear that ""Knightfall Protocol"" means ""make sure the world knows I'm home and then blow up the mansion so everyone thinks I'm dead, but I'm not.""   I didn't get the impression from the non-complete ending that Batman was killed by whatever villains were still left.   I think the most obvious answer is that it was Bruce Wayne that ""died"" that night so that he could continue on as Batman. But I think the criminals would catch on pretty quickly to the fact that they never found Wayne's body, and Batman is back, so Wayne must not be dead.  I can't tell if the writers had a really clear purpose to that ending, and I'm just not getting it, or if they just wanted to be purposefully vague so people would have conversations like this."

arkhamknight,3cjwy1,Xplicity19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:44:52 2015 UTC,My money is on either Azrael or Jason Todd using Scarecrows fear toxin in small doses (like in a smoke pellet or track gun) to stop their violent ways of protecting people and using fear to be the ultimate myth. Demon Batman lol.  Another neat twist could be Gordan.

You have to go where you fight the Arkham Knight in the sniper battle... where Gordon was sitting is a grate, you go under it and through a tunnel through the wall and drop down. I didn't see this the first time I was here and god damn was it really hard to figure out how to get there."

arkhamknight,3cim6m,sav86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Founder's Island, underneath the area where the Lex Corp building is there should be a ramp heading up to the top road which isn't to far from the area you need to be. Just look for the area where you had to go find Gordon if you can remember it. Might take a bit to recognize it just cruise around a bit, I remember the area has a very distinct floor tiling pattern. Your probably going to have track back through all of that story related area just to get to the spot though so it will be a bit of a hike."
arkhamknight,3ch6bb,magabzdy,6,Tue Jul 7 21:46:27 2015 UTC,I finished 100% last night and I felt safe to read spoilers. I saw in the cast list that someone voiced Zsasz. Zsasz was one of my favorite side missions in city.  I couldn't remember seeing him at all in this game.  Thanks for pointing that out!
arkhamknight,3ch6bb,prozach64,2,Tue Jul 7 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"There was a riddle where you had to scan 3 dead thugs. It was Szasz who killed them.   The riddle is on Founder's Island.

arkhamknight,3chkk6,cma1681,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"I thought it was the perfect balance. I never felt lost and directionless but also never felt like my experience was being directed for me. I could drift in and out of the main story arc as I pleased and all of the side missions were fun and had their own little engaging story arcs. As far as ""forced"" car combat, I can't be forced to do something I can not get enough of... :) So to each their own I suppose. I think the people that are engrossed with this game are people that love 100%ing, as it can get a bit grindy towards the end of the most wanted quest lines."

arkhamknight,3chjpc,trebud69,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:18:30 2015 UTC,Just beat the game game and get points for that then do it. It makes no difference as the endings are different.
arkhamknight,3cg2b3,MoreDann,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:00 2015 UTC,There's definitely a way because I got almost all of the trophies after I did the Knightfall protocol (for the first time). I don't think I had gotten any in the Subway tunnels before that.
arkhamknight,3cgjnv,iixshizzxii,2,Tue Jul 7 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"Without going into details to avoid spoilers you can complete them in any order.  I'd recommend completing side missions first then story, but like I say the order you complete them in doesn't affect the ending you get."
arkhamknight,3cgjnv,Beard_No_Beard,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks! (Thanks for not putting spoilers as well!!). I wanted to finish side quests first as I feel the ending of the story should be the ending of the game, but I only ever read about other people finishing the story first and then the side quests and wasn't sure if it would affect it the other way around."
arkhamknight,3cgjnv,Beard_No_Beard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:26:40 2015 UTC,Yeah the game's designed to work whichever order you do them in. For instance I did the story first with the majority of the side missions done then completed the side missions after and it made sense.  Enjoy!
arkhamknight,3cgjnv,UltravioIence,2,Tue Jul 7 23:10:29 2015 UTC,the 100% ending is just a longer version of the other ending. it has all the same scenes plus a few more.

On PS4, I've only encountered 1 freeze in about 60 or so hours of playing through 2 playthroughs. It wasn't a full lock out, just seemed like it wouldn't load, and the loading icon was spinning forever until I had to start the game. It occurred when you had to defend a certain plant in the Batmobile.  This is a retail version if this matters. In the past there has been performance differences between retail and digital copies."

arkhamknight,3ch7k3,ChalmersCashOut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:24:05 2015 UTC,I do and the only service I have issue with is Hulu where it keeps pausing aka buffering while playing a show or movie.   Last night I fell out of the map right before I tried saving the last firefighter. That mission so far was really hard for me to get through on one play. Once I passed that mission the game froze again. Also having issue with changing weapons where the screen doesn't stay on unless I hold down the button some times.
arkhamknight,3ch7k3,delerioso,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"So your game starts to buffer after resuming from a Hulu session. If your game is on disc, have your tried clearing your persistent storage? Didn't really help me but if its a loading loop, that might help you.  Settings>bluray n disc   At least I know I'm not the only one with weird loading loops and freezes. I was so close to sending my console in for rma but I tried the resume play with other games and it was fine."

So every 5/10/15 will check an item off the Riddler list.  The objects themselves vary depending on which part of the map you're in. In the streets you get the red and yellow shields, in the Arkham Knight HQ you get large mechanical bugs, on the Stagg airship there are boxes that you can either smash or open using the Batclaw, and in the Panessa film studios the objects are jack-in-the-boxes."

I felt t like the scarecrow in arkham asylum vs. The scarecrow in arkham knight are two different characters that just happen to use fear toxin. Honestly scarecrow sounded more like an extension of Hugo strange from Arkham City than actual scarecrow. I also believe they changed his voice actor. That may just be me though"

Pretty much no villains other than AK, Scarecrow, Ivy, and Harley had any real impact on the main story, Hell most of the other villains activities have nothing to do with the premise that Scarecrow brought them all together to take down batman.  Harvey is just trying to rob banks and gets mad that batman shows up, pyg is doing his own thing, etc.  Nightwing shows up to help a little bit with penguin, but doesn't come to help with the rest of the major major shit going on in the city.  Too much of the side stuff just seems to ignore what is happening in the city, and vice versa."
arkhamknight,3cdbbh,Dr-DuB,3,Tue Jul 7 03:30:55 2015 UTC,I liked that they didnt force all the villians on you in the main story. But the side missions themselves were dull

Hated that electronic effect it had and really took away any sense of threat.   Remember in city thinking ""aw damn"" when you first encounter a dude with a disruptor or a ninja or a plain brute. Nothing in knight had the same effect for me. Really didn't like the air drone things and hated everything about the tank battles"
arkhamknight,3cdbbh,Moffee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:26 2015 UTC,Well depending on where you are in terms of nightwing might still be captured by penguin in most people's playthroughs. So it makes some sense why he wouldn't show up.

I made the mistake of trying to find all the fire crew and realised after a hour of flying round that they probably unlocked as the storyline progressed. None of the Riddler Trophies are mission only, and it just makes finding everything more simple cause if you take out all the air patrols, the police choppers help you out a little and spot some sideline missions for you."

Since the line launcher is only really used in a few spots in this game I don't blame you or others for having difficulty with this. I had trouble with this myself, but I realized it was because I was just clicking it and not holding it down. Holding the stick down and got it on the first try."
arkhamknight,3ccwkw,benelevator,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:31:01 2015 UTC,There's a spot along the wall (up and towards the left) you can land on after you eject from there you can use your line-launcher. It's a really skinny ledge though and it took me a few tries to land without falling off.
arkhamknight,3ceacg,The_UnApologist,8,Tue Jul 7 06:10:10 2015 UTC,"I mean really, what were you actually expecting. This is the 4th game with the same mechanics, they had to introduce something new to spice it up. Yeah the batmobile didn't have ""forza"" handling but it was a car that turned in to a tank, what more could you expect?  And all of the games have been bad about useless side quests, that's what made them fun. This one was more of the same but with some shiny new features like predator missions with an alarm to cover your sound and multi-character fighting.    Sounds to me like you wouldn't have liked it no matter what they did."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,jh820439,7,Tue Jul 7 09:05:48 2015 UTC,"The Batmobile in pursuit mode was amazing man, handles beautifully, never had any problems. Your trippin man."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,The__Ugly,5,Tue Jul 7 11:31:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It took some time to get used to, but now that I am, it handles great and is tons of fun.  I don't even mind the tank battles, battle mode works great too, there's a just a few too many of them"
arkhamknight,3ceacg,JohnLocke815,5,Tue Jul 7 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"I just don't see how you can expect Forza style car mechanics and realism when were talking about a Batman game and the batmobile/tank/tumbler which has basically a jet rocket on the back of it. I honestly just don't get the hate of the batmobile...what more do people want from a batman game made by Rocksteady? no batmobile? you want another city to fly around in??? honestly the batmobile is awesome and it plays exactly like how I would expect it to.  You can basically skip all AR content with the exception of Azrael's story/quest sequences and the new bat suit training which you get early on.  Riddler's Revenge is just another series of missions/quests that you don't even need to collect trophies or solve riddles to complete...UNLESS you want to fight him at the end or you want to 100% the game which it sounds like you don't.  If you aren't even that far in the story line then Arkham Knight doesn't deserve the character criticism you give him, since there is more to his story then just a a guy in a high tech suit that is on the surface is petulant.  I too play on the Xbox One and have only ever encountered one bug and that's when I went to enter the bank to stop a heist, but pressed the wrong button and had Batman jump right back into the batmobile which started the mission, but I couldn't get back inside thus having me to restart the game. This game is far from glitchy...and in the 30 some hours I've put into the game so far that's all I've experienced your claims on glitchiness I find hard to believe."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,sav86,3,Tue Jul 7 09:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm on Xbox one and I have several glitches. Most of them cause me to have to force stop the game. Usually what happens is that the picture freezes and sound continues with the sound that was going on at the time. Generally happens when I am doing something graphics intensive, such as driving fast through the city. The one that pissed me off the most though was when I was hunting down the cloudburst. I had finished off all the Cobras, and it froze as I was attacking the cloudburst. Had to start that whole part over again.   Anyway, the part I dislike about the game was no real boss battles. Spoilers ahead--- I was hoping when death stroke showed up, I would be able to at least fight him, but then that just turned into yet another lame tank battle. The hardest actual fights in the game seem to be the penguin ones, and those get watered down by having nightwing show up and help. It seemed literally everything they had for this game went into writing the story, which isn't terrible. But they forgot to make it fun to play. I got the sense I was watching a movie with interactive parts more than playing a game."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,Ceedub260,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:02:53 2015 UTC,"This game DOES have the most glitches/bugs in the series (not counting Origins, as that was a mess by a different developer)  I drove through the floor many times. Quest markers were fucked...some controls were unresponsive at times.  It's still a great experience, but it definitely has glitches."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,thismadhatter,-1,Tue Jul 7 10:39:08 2015 UTC,"I wasnt expecting ""forza mechanics."" I was pointing out that Forza has ruined driving in other games for me and that the driving physics in Arkham Knight are laughably primitive. The car flips over too easily, it also has twitchy torque control and the grandiose Riddler race tracks amplify the car's stupid physics.  As for me bringing up real driving simulators, that was because they've ruined driving in other games for me. The closest game I can tolerate the driving physics for is GTA:V. That's also an unrealistic game, however they at least made the driving mechanics and physics a little more believable and user friendly, unlike Arkham Knight: World of Tanks edition."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,thismadhatter,3,Tue Jul 7 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"The Riddler aspect of this game was a complete gong show. Riddler trophies were awesome in Arkham Asylum...but this title and Arkham City they just seem like a fucking chore.  The batmobile tank battles were about 5-6 too many. The chases for intel vans were awesome...but the tank battles were just boring after about 5.  Overall, everything seemed kind of downscaled in this game. Less fighting, less predator missions, and almost no legitimate boss fights.  I still enjoyed the game...but Arkham City and Asylum were way better."
arkhamknight,3ceacg,TalkingRaccoon,2,Tue Jul 7 10:37:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I liked the ""thinky"" riddler trophies, even then some were copies of others. How many times did you pick up a trophy only to be abushed by gun bots, and the solution was to squish them with a weight or a boxcar? Like 3 times? Any way, they should have gutted the ones that were just out in the open, or behind the walls."

Also I think the thug chatter is pretty funny and Arkham knight was a pretty interesting villain because do his similarity to batman but and how he has a personal grudge against him. However I do agree that the side missions where not that fulfilling. The final missions for every side mission besides the riddler are not hard at all. That batmobile is awesome too , IMO it handles great."

arkhamknight,3ceacg,acelister,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"The Batmobile handles pretty awfully and the Arkham Knight's reveal was terrible.  Other than that, it's a good take on the Knightfall comic storyline. Gotham is overrun and Batman has to run himself ragged taking his rogues down.  Yes, the Riddler trophies are annoying, but without them the city would be empty. If there was no chatter, people would complain it was too quiet and solitary."

arkhamknight,3ceacg,thismadhatter,-5,Tue Jul 7 06:56:01 2015 UTC,"I stayed away from bitching about the car for a good reason. 1. Its too easy to bitch about it, 2. Next to proper racing games like Forza, the shitmobile in Arkham Knight has laughably pathetic handling and physics.  Perhaps my obsession with real driving simulators like Forza have tainted my opinions on anything lesser, but Arkham Knight's Shitmobile is truly god-awful, the thing flips constantly, and the torque handling is disgusting. I'd even rather drive cars from GTA: FOUR over this, which is saying how much I hate it.  I've tried to adjust and get into it, but after the last Riddler race, I simply cannot. It's just horribly annoying. If there was one thing they should definitely patch, its the stupid car.  The other thing I hate about it is the absurdly primative targeting reticle when you're firing the 60mm cannon. Next to the backdrop of Gotham's rain and flourescent cityscape, accuracy is tragic, even on my big 55 inch tv, I can't even imagine what it must be like on a smaller monitor or TV screen.  All in all, the car is the biggest thing dragging the game's tempo and performance down. It's truly awful and I avoid it now like the plague because it also means I don't need to worry about engaging in never ending bland drone battles. Plus as I said, I feel as though proper driving sims have ruined and tainted my opinions on driving in other games."

Also I suggest doing the 100% playthrough the first time. It's so worth it to see it first.
arkhamknight,3c8eqg,TheSilentGhost,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:29:00 2015 UTC,"I've ready start the new game+ felt I should fully best the game by being the best from the beginning, plus it's more challenging. I stop doing the side mission half way through so I still got a lot of those to see for the first time and such."
arkhamknight,3c99uq,Alladaskill17,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:19:24 2015 UTC,I don't know the exact percentage but it is probably around 80%
arkhamknight,3c99uq,JCreazy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"I just got it today, it's somewhere between 60 and 70% iirc"
arkhamknight,3c99uq,SSJRoshi,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies. FYI I unlocked it at ~55% (just did a mission and its a 59%), finished fire fighters (which does require the batmobile on Founder's Island)."
arkhamknight,3c9utb,DrakonFyre,3,Mon Jul 6 05:57:42 2015 UTC,And here I am thinking she did a great job.
arkhamknight,3c9utb,ThiefofNobility,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:25:24 2015 UTC,"Different opinions, my friend. I'm not gonna hate you forever for thinking she did."
arkhamknight,3c9utb,ThiefofNobility,2,Tue Jul 7 14:59:43 2015 UTC,Lol true. I enjoy hearing Steve blum in a bunch of thugs. He's all over the game. And it still blows my mind that Nolan north is penguin.
arkhamknight,3c9utb,ThiefofNobility,2,Tue Jul 7 15:44:01 2015 UTC,They do great. And I really LOVE Selina's voice.
arkhamknight,3c9utb,OptimumCorridor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:59:55 2015 UTC,Ah yes! The woman who does Selina is excellent. I felt NW and Robin were great too.   Not to mention Ashley Greene and Jonathan Banks as the Gordon family?  Excellent choices.
arkhamknight,3c9utb,Batvatar,2,Tue Jul 7 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"Nightwing kind of, but I don't feel like there was enough there for me to really fairly judge. Robin has just enough, and yes, I agree.   And yes, Babs and Jim are both solid. I REALLY like Babs' voice."

arkhamknight,3c8467,Worryaboutstuff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:46:40 2015 UTC,Iust figured that out haha. Thanks
arkhamknight,3c8467,shizknight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:10:00 2015 UTC,Do you mean the checkpoint walls?
arkhamknight,3c844l,LennytheGoodson,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:05:05 2015 UTC,Can't you load a previous save? I believe there are 3 saves in your file.
arkhamknight,3c844l,jimbodeako,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:45:33 2015 UTC,How would I go about doing that ? I don't see an option to do that anywhere
arkhamknight,3c844l,Aquafoot,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:34 2015 UTC,"Back out to the first menu of the game, where you choose your save slot. From there, you have the option to hold... L1 I think it is... to load a previous save the game keeps backed up."
arkhamknight,3c844l,jimbodeako,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"2 ways, the easiest is:  On Arkam Knight on the Select Saved Game screen on the bottom it says to hold L1 and it shows your backup saves(I had 2) and you can cycle between them by clicking L1.  The other way would be to go on your PS4 home screen, go to settings, then to Application Saved Data Management. Then go to Saved Data in Online Storage(assuming you have  PS Plus) and then Download to System Storage and pick a save file from there maybe?   I always have a USB drive plugged in and always put a save on there as well as the PS Plus cloud. You can never be to safe as you can see."
arkhamknight,3c844l,svmd,0,Sun Jul 5 22:50:26 2015 UTC,thanks.
arkhamknight,3c844l,jewman9000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:27:02 2015 UTC,The same thing has just happened to me on Xbox One. I've completed the main story and about 60% completed overall. I got killed while fighting Riddler's goons and now I just keep falling under the map exactly like in this video every time I respawn. Looks like the location/mission is irrelevant. Hope they fix this soon.
arkhamknight,3c844l,ehaislar,2,Mon Jul 6 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem on my xbone. As soon as it loads, I just pressed A and glided through a few walls and landed on the street. Never happened again."
arkhamknight,3c844l,Tomato_Ketchup,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:05:55 2015 UTC,I had this happen. Just reboot the game you will start on a random building.

arkhamknight,3c6upw,MyTulpa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:18:25 2015 UTC,I'm glad someone could enjoy it :) I still haven't started...
arkhamknight,3c6upw,G_O_,2,Mon Jul 6 15:44:26 2015 UTC,So what trophy do I get for 100%?
arkhamknight,3c6upw,TheSilentGhost,2,Sun Jul 5 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"Just beat it, I don't think there is a trophy, but I think it's worth it."
arkhamknight,3c6upw,1337_Pizza_Farmer,2,Sun Jul 5 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"Take your time. Clear out one Burroughs a day, or something like that. You'll be done before you know it."
arkhamknight,3c72r2,SentientDust,2,Sun Jul 5 14:03:35 2015 UTC,They're still working on it. They released a few patches that fix some bugs and crashes but it's going to take some time to get everything fixed.
arkhamknight,3c72r2,Bigboss537,2,Sun Jul 5 14:36:28 2015 UTC,Apparantly a big patch is on it's way  Steam Database   about 3 hours ago Change #1148109  branches/qa_1088440/buildid: 673395  branches/qa_1088440/description: Zep-MS17_0.04-WBQA-PC-FullPatch_1088440-07_03_2015_Auto  branches/qa_1088440/pwdrequired: 1 branches/qa_1088440/pwdtestgid: 3D9C5C…A0762B
arkhamknight,3c72r2,Vollmilchtrinker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:44:06 2015 UTC,It's been playable. Granted I had to have all the settings on low but then it was smooth sailing.
arkhamknight,3c72r2,JCreazy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'm playing on PC and having no problems at all. Everything's on high or higher, no crashes, and I'm just on a 780. I really don't get what the big deal has been.  My biggest gripe about the game is as you get to the end, instead of memorable fights, they just start throwing numbers at you."
arkhamknight,3c72r2,the_swolestice,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:37:51 2015 UTC,"I got mine with my laptop together with Witcher 3 and decided to redeem the code. It turned out playable with some serious frame drops occasionally. Normally its over 30fp, sometimes around 50. Still i have a fresh system and only 3 games isnstalled, almost no other programs except for the w8.1 built in ones. My friend with better configuration in desktop had major crashes and serious frame drops 30% of batmobile time do i guess  there's a lot of luck included. From what I've heard intalling the game on ssd helps. I have mine on hdd though. My system keeps around 60fps in Witcher 3 so it's ridiculous that AK tends to lag, it's not as bad as I've read over the internets."
arkhamknight,3c72r2,casualtroublemaker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:27:58 2015 UTC,I have to play on the bare minimum settings on PC. If I'm lucky I can play the game for a solid 1-2 hours before the memory issue causes a crash. I have also gotten some fatal error crashes as well. It's unfortunate because the game is really fun and I feel like I'm not getting everything out of it that I should.
arkhamknight,3c72r2,Simsam16,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:39:27 2015 UTC,Anyone know how to fix flickering shadows on the pc version? That's the one thing messing it up
arkhamknight,3c72r2,Createsz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"I was able to play it to completion with only the occasional crash on PC, with everything turned up, getting 60fps most of the time, but that was on a Titan X. I think being able to play it right now is just an issue of horsepower more so than showstopper bugs."
