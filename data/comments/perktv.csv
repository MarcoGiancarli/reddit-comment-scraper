You can get 30% cashback using Befrugal /nonref.  I've used Befrugal on a $35 Virgin Mobile deal and received payout after 60 days or so.  I know everyone hates ref links, but let's get a ref train going and make a few bucks together!  You can get 12% back from Swagbucks if you prefer that route.      You can also get Fuels refurbed from ebay for $15 here.  They are slightly more expensive, but you could use eBay gift cards from Perk to help cover the cost.  You'll also receive roughly 2% back in eBay buck.  You can pull an additional 1.1% cashback from BeFrugal or 1% from Swagbucks when shopping at eBay."

It has been able to run any update and/or app Perk throws at it, almost never crashes(only on times where I don't even clear the cache) and it's currently just 9 bucks !  I also only run it on one phone and at a time on a Gen4 itouch but it's really bothersome having to wait for more questions to load so now I just run it on one phone only.  Then I would say it's the Concord 2 and lastly the moto g (but the moto g did ran better than the Concord tbh, not as cheap though)"

They get the job done at a bargain price.  They also, however, have a use life of about 6-7 months before they get the bootloop of death. Apparently they have shitty flash memory and it craps out after this long of constant use. You'll get your money's worth long before then, though. I just had my first one burn out in about 6.5 months and am getting a warranty replacement from Tracfone. The other two I have are probably not far behind. Just something to consider."

Or the strangest off all,,, they are not airing commercials in order to increase their profit margin?  I think that the timing of the drop in pay-outs is kind of horrible being that it is coordinating with one of the worst times for advertising availability but the ads will start flowing again soon and incomes will return.

perktv,3dywjq,Wifihelpneeded,4,Mon Jul 20 18:44:16 2015 UTC,Perk is basically a Ponzi scheme. Somebody makes a lot of money before it pops. Somebody makes some money before it pops. Many will lose a lot of money when it pops.
perktv,3dywjq,gorgonzoler,3,Mon Jul 20 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"Do the math and examine their business model to determine their viability to sustain and grow before you invest.  According to Perk, as of June 30, 2015, Perk US had achieved the following operating milestones: 4.5+ million installations of Perk apps 5+ billion Ad Impressions US$10+ million in Perk Rewards paid   5 Billion Ads yielding $10M in rewards equates to 2 points per Ad (1000 pts = $1). Users would have to watch 500 Ads on average to earn $1.  Perk is moving to reward active tappers with higher points and reducing passive earners with fewer points. Let's say the active tappers are rewarded with 3 points per Ad. It would take watching 333 Ads to make $1. If each Ad round is 30 seconds longs, it would take 166 minutes of Ads to make $1. Suppose the tappers cheat a little so instead of paying attention to the Ads, they turn off the volume and focus on tapping 5 devices simultaneously. It will take 33 minutes of actively tapping 5 devices to make $1. We know realistically, it takes more than 30 seconds per round with the ever present spinning circles so it would take much longer for even the tappers to make one dollar. If it's 60 sec per round, it will take the 5-device-tappers 66 min to earn $1. What if it's 2 min per round? Is that a viable business plan? One could argue that the minimal earnings will drive active tappers to pursue higher earnings through acquisition of more devices and passive earning. Let's say the passive earner is rewarded with 1 point per round. At 30 sec per round, it would take 500 minutes of Ads to earn $1. Let's say the passive earner has a 15 device farm. It would take the same 33 minutes as the active 5-device-tappers to make $1. It it's 2 min per round, it will take 2 hours to make $1 or $12/day. Is that a viable business plan? Will the current business plan drive the passive earners to seek riskier exploits to increase earnings? How many active user accounts are there? Will their current strategy spur growth? At 4.5 million installs and $10 Mil rewards paid, that averages to $2.22 in total rewards per install. With the frequent updates and spinning circles, we are forced to update and reinstall frequently. If every user have installed, reinstalled, or updated 100 times, there are about 45,000 accounts. I would not be surprised if some of you have installed it 1000's of times when your devices drag."

Perk isn't really an advertising company if you ask me... It seems to be more than that, if you analyze the IPA and you know what it's about you'll see... Well I dont wanna spoil it for everyone, I'll just leave it there. There's more to it than just Ad playing, at least that's how it is with perk TV"
perktv,3dywjq,Drovid,5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:11 2015 UTC,You do know day to day trading has absolutely nothing to do with how the app is running or how many reviews the app has?

perktv,3dzgg0,cyan000,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:57 2015 UTC,still perk
perktv,3dzgg0,omfgzakum,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"I have been splitting it a bit between my devices... I honestly think that you could make more with Perk. I say 'could' because Perk is VERY unpredictable. One day you could get tons of ads, and the apps could all run perfectly, the next you are out of ads and Perk is making your phones explode every 5 minutes.   I think that Checkpoints might pay a little bit less, but there is no 'are you watching'. The videos seem to run very well (check on them 2-3 times a day), they pay instantly (most of the time), and the minimum is just $1.   I think you should start off your day with Perk, see how it goes for a bit, and if it's bad move over to Checkpoints."
perktv,3dzgg0,Fishering,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:39 2015 UTC,I believe this would defiantly replace perk pop quiz with the new changes.
perktv,3dzgg0,Wifihelpneeded,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:54 2015 UTC,i've never tried checkpoints but if it's passive and constant (like rewardrack when it had ads all day) then it should be pretty easy to figure out a good average earnings per day per device.. anyone wanna experiment?
perktv,3dzgg0,stevil30,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:37 2015 UTC,I have been tracking Perk with Swagbucks and Checkpoints daily. All my Perk is on LG Fuels and all Checkpoints on Moto Gs. The biggest Checkpoints earn I ever saw was 125 pts this year on my iphone 5s. It took me 2.5 months to get 1 card for $25 on Checkpoints and that was with scanning barcodes at times.  I get $25 a week via perk with $8 left over in points.   It seems Checkpoints craps out at or near the 100 pt mark daily.   I make the most with swagbucks but not passively
perktv,3dzgg0,duckduck_goose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:57:30 2015 UTC,The problem with checkpoints is that you're limited to 1 phone per account.   You can have as many accounts as you want to but you'll need a different phone number for each account.
perktv,3dzgg0,Adampro123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:37 2015 UTC,"I don't use Checkpoints, what is the phone number for any way? Can you use a home phone/landline?"

perktv,3dzgg0,duckduck_goose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:20 2015 UTC,From my limited testing it seems checkpoints uses much less bandwidth than perk pop quiz though I'm curious to see others experience in this.  I'm guessing the ability to add more phones for those limited by bandwidth plus much higher app stability could even out the earnings compared to perk or even pass it
perktv,3dzgg0,OCR755,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:13 2015 UTC,I recently upgraded the passivity of my iphones and my 3gs became obsolete. I was going to liquidate them for a 4/4s but I've decided to run checkpoints on the old guys instead. Even if I only get to redeem 1/month I figure the price of 3gs has bottomed out.

perktv,3dwc9h,sage626700,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:32:58 2015 UTC,Oh that makes much more sense... I think it would work fine but there are powered hubs that would make cable management more elegant... The 4 sided ports looks like it would be messy.  I would go with something like this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051PGX2I/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3?pf_rd_p=1944687542&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B00OJ79UK6&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=12C1MQS670Q6SEB8YNJX  Edit:  After reading the reviews on the hub I linked I wouldn't buy it.  The design is nice but it doesn't have enough power to charge devices.
perktv,3dwc9h,perkolatingpts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:42:59 2015 UTC,It seems those that say it doesn't have enough charging power are running storage devices.
perktv,3dwc9h,PortableBacon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, these have high failure rates. A shame since no one else seems to make a similar style."
perktv,3dwc9h,Zokonk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:38 2015 UTC,I bought the 24 port one. Waited for it to ship and when finally arrived the top part was some crazy UK plug. Went thru the hassle of shipping it back (free tho thx to Amazon) and got the correct replacement.  Been working great for my 20 phones the past few months. A bunch of fuels and a handful of iPod touches.  The blue leds bright at night but the units kind of under a couch so it's not horrible.  A sticker or black tape over the led would take care of that. The units bigger then I thought it would be but like I said mines hidden so no big deal.

perktv,3dwc9h,extrudedcow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"I've been using two AmazonBasics 7 port hubs for a few months now, no trouble with my Hydros, Events, and Concord IIs. Mine came with 4A adapters, enough for >500mA per port. They're pretty good if you want/need an actual hub rather than just a charger."
perktv,3dwc9h,zacker150,0,Mon Jul 20 23:40:01 2015 UTC,The only problem with this is that you still have to get the chargers.   Edit. I mean charging cables. :P
perktv,3dwc9h,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:01 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the chargers that come with the phones work?
perktv,3dwc9h,hardonchairs,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the phone. I use Zingers, and they charge slowly and stay at 100%, running only perk apps with the screen dimmed fully."
perktv,3dwc9h,zacker150,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, they will be fine as long as the charger thing you linked can handle however many phones you plug in."
perktv,3dwc9h,wafflleez,0,Mon Jul 20 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"Not quite, as the USB ports on practically all non-OEM chargers do fail to short out the data connections. As a result, your phone will think that it is connected to a USB port on a computer. The charge-sync cables that come with the phones will allow you to charge, but it will be at the rate of 500 mA. This is not fast enough to keep the phone running with the screen on. To fix this, you will need to get some fast charging cables, which have the data pins shorted out already.   A cheaper plan would be to get some power strips and use the OEM chargers that come with your phones."
perktv,3dwc9h,zacker150,3,Mon Jul 20 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you got that 500mA number correct because that is more than enough to  get the phone charging when the screen is on (and perking). You mean to tell me that your battery % is going DOWN while you are connected to a PC while perking?  That has never happened to me. It goes up... but very slowly (like 6+ hrs to get from 5% to 100%).  My Moto G charger has a max output of 550mA and it takes like 3-4 hrs to charge completely, while perk apps are running. The typical faster chargers are like 1000mA to 1200mA (1.0A to 1.2A)."
perktv,3dwc9h,wafflleez,0,Mon Jul 20 02:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yah. The official USB 1.0 and 2.0 spec says that 500 mA is the maximum current draw for a standard downstream (can carry data) port. Occasionally, I use my primary phone (Nexus 5) with both SBTV and Perk, and when it's plugged into my computer and running at the same time the battery level will actually slowly go down.   Edit. I just whipped out my handy USB power meter and confirmed that I am actually getting between 420 and 470 mA from my computer."
perktv,3dwc9h,zacker150,2,Mon Jul 20 03:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I charge my phones on my PC while running Perk, all the time, and it always charges slowly. You might have some cheap charger cables, or faulty ports, or something else?"

perktv,3du0wi,InternetUser007,4,Sun Jul 19 14:22:19 2015 UTC,The problem with that is that 1 device will not earn you much.

Take 2/3rds of the information you read oer the last 6-12 months back on this sub and throw it out the window.  A lot has changed since then.  The days of people running $40-50 Moto G's off a $200-300 router with premium 300mbs internet service are gone.  Those people made a shitton of money doing it but the game was very different back then.  If you're going to do it, buy the cheapest devices you can get your hands on.  $9 LG's or ZTE's or even used devices.  Don't upgrade your internet or your router, just run them on what you have when you're able to.  Premium devices used to be more stable, now since Perk as whole has gone to shit it doesn't matter what you run, they're all going to crash and freeze.  If you watch netflix and your internet bogs down like a bitch shut the phones off, you're not making much on them anyway.  Perk is a great way to make a few bucks a day by wasting time dicking around with phones.  You're probably making $1.50/hr for your time, but if you're a poor college kid or a stay at home mom, it might be worth it.  Full disclosure:  I'm continuing to Perk and it's been good to me, the program used to be better than it is now.  I've been doing it for about 9mo now and have $200 of hardware invested and I've made about $1,300.  My stuff has paid for itself 6 times over so I'm not stopping until my stuff starts to die and then I'll have to re-assess."

A couple months ago I wouldn't have thought twice, I would have instantly replaced it. Also plan on spending some time babysitting whatever devices you get. They are pretty unstable.

It's been fairly stable, at least for me, and the two hour popup isn't great but it's workable.  You won't make much but then it doesn't take much effort either.  Pop Quiz crashes constantly and the points have decreased, Live is a mess.  Perhaps start with a couple of phones, run one on TV and experiment with the others and see what's worth it for you."
perktv,3du0wi,hb122,2,Sun Jul 19 15:44:23 2015 UTC,It is certainly not worth it now.
perktv,3du0wi,Truth_Tella,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Earnings are down No one knows when more nerfs are coming. (3 times already this year, each nerf is 35-65% reduction in earnings, plus time.) Perk has shown some very lowlife methods of doing business( only a premium members and only premium members can justify.) Premium members (community is now composed of of these people who are willing to sell soul, and kiss Perks ass. I am just waiting to see when and how Perk is going to screw them over.) Perk is now a publicly traded company. This does not bold well for us users (bloated payrolls expenses, larger legal team(this is never good, they always find was to spend company money), investors expectation/returns). Will be at the expense of the user.   Cannot recommend at this point. When my phones give, I give."
perktv,3du0wi,tomtomnyc2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Its really not worth it for Perk anymore. The earnings have continued to drop drastically over the last year. There is zero transparency from Perk about major changes, and it will only continue to get worse. Its not worth the headache of maintaining multiple phones and constantly monitoring what is supposed to be passive earning because the apps freeze and crash after a few hours.  Perk has enough people that dont know any better using their apps to where they can still drop earnings and those people wont care."

If I bought 5 cheap phones today I would recoup the cost in 1-2 months   I don't have expensive routers or a super internet connection.  So yes it is worth it but the days of raking it in are over.    The main issue for me is that it isn't as passive any more.  You have to put some work in doing some clicking now and then. Either to answer some pop quiz questions, click on the are you still watching pop up or restarting crashed apps.  I mean but what do you expect - you have to do something to earn something."
perktv,3du0wi,jb82,0,Sun Jul 19 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"Casual effort with 5 phones is now about $25 every 3 weeks for me.  Down from when I first started Perk (early last year) it was about $25/week.  It's still worth it, sort of.  But only if the phones are very cheap, and reliable (Fuels or Moto Gs in my book).  It's easy to break even at $25/week.  Much harder at $25 every 3-4 weeks."

The only reason advertisers are still paying to play their ads here is because they have too much money. No advertiser will ever put budget money into an audience black hole, so they do it either out of revenge for whoever they need to rip off, or if they just need to get rid of this money to be able to put it down as an expense and avoid taxes (if it's an incorporated company) so I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE WISER THAN ME AND WE ARE POINTLESSLY BITCHING.

Has 2 cords coming out of the back that you plug in and that's it. Everything else is hidden inside. And as a bonus I added 2 USB computer fan's mounted on the side and drilled holes through the tackle box to keep the phones and power strips cool. I spent about 25 on it. 40 if you add the fans. But I've had that setup for about 10 months now and it's amazing. I had to clean the dust out from the inside a few months ago because it got so bad from the fans constantly being on.

perktv,3dseag,Bawlin92,3,Sun Jul 19 00:58:52 2015 UTC,Unfortunately quiz's don't reset for me. I just tried a category I finished 2 months ago and it says I am out of questions.
perktv,3dseag,grandadmiralstrife,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:24:28 2015 UTC,Does a pop-up window come up when you're out of questions? I've never seen it say that I'm out of questions; usually the circle just spins and no new questions appear.
perktv,3dseag,TankTur,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:17 2015 UTC,There should be a pop up saying there are no more questions for the category and ask if you'd like to go to (insert next available category here)

It has nothing to do with Perk or Discover and everything to do with anti-money laundering  procedures implemented as part of the Patriot Act.  IOW - blame your Congressman."
perktv,3doxi1,JustFenix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting you say this because I truly don't have a credit history. Do you think perk can override this after I send them pics of my proof (License and SSN Card)?"
perktv,3doxi1,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,2,Sat Jul 18 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"They will, because they aren't offering you any credit - simply verifying your identity due to the patriot act rules."
perktv,3doxi1,rpetunderclass,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:34 2015 UTC,"I emailed them and they said they can get me the card manually. And what /u/JustFenix said makes sense, I just turned 18 and had to do a manual application with American Express prepaid and other stuff cause I supposedly don't exist. I would look into investing in a secured card to start establishing your identity/credit. I got approved with Capital One for $200 with a $100 no fees, high APR though, but if you pay the bill in full every month they don't charge you anything."
perktv,3doxi1,iwillnoteatgreeneggs,3,Sat Jul 18 07:38:13 2015 UTC,"I had issues yesterday, wasted all 3 tries and was not approved.  Contacted customer service and they suggested I try again today - after your third attempt the application is locked for 24 hours from the last try.  Tried 2 times today, and was figuring the 3rd would also fail, but it did approve me, immediately removed the 11k points from my account and sent me an email that the card is on the way.  The best suggestion i can give you is this:   Make sure that you are using exactly the same information as your perk account Make sure everything is capitalized exactly as your perk account is. The third try requires your complete 9-digit SSN number. That's what got me approved I imagine - PERK did not have this information for me yet."

Computer will work though.  I might be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure you need to get paid by check a couple of times first before they let you do the PayPal thing.  They probably just do that to make sure you aren't scamming them maybe?  I don't know the exact reason but I had to wait to add PayPal.  I swear though, it literally took them hours to add money to my PayPal account once they processed my GC where as a check takes a week or two.  I've waited 13 days for a check from them before but to be honest I don't mind.  I'd rather not spend the money and slowly let it build up."

perktv,3dq5y3,ithaclies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:19 2015 UTC,Good stuff.  The only thing to be aware of is PayPal takes I think like a $3.50 fee out so really out of $100 you're only getting $86.50.  Wih the way things are now.  I'll gladly just wait for the check for $90.25 but that depends on what you use the money for.  I'm in a position where i can just wait while others might like that quick transfer to PayPal to pay for something.
perktv,3dq5y3,greenmky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:54 2015 UTC,Yea the PayPal fees are a little ridiculous but if you want the money instantly(within an hour in my case) it's a good option.

This was my first time using their site so I used the check redemption option to see if there were any hidden fees. The check was for $90.25, exactly what the website quoted. I didn't use the app so I'm not exactly answering your question, but you can save yourself the paypal fees if you're willing to wait a week"

From what I've seen on the Perk facebook page they say they have a shortage of ads because of the time of year.  I tend to believe them because I also do swagbucks and the ads on that site have dried up compared to how they usually are.  The summer is just probably a dead time for ad buys.
perktv,3dlqj8,chicomandell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:36:24 2015 UTC,"As far as assigning static IPs to the phones that won't matter.  Everything outside of your network will only see your router's IP address.  So you could try to get a new IP address for your router.  Most of the time you can just power your router off for 30 minutes and then it will give you a new IP, but you would have to check for specific steps depending on your router."

Doesn't matter how much I read because I can tell what box with flashy lights is being talked about.  :)  So my modem gets an IP from my provider. Then my routers assign individual IPs to each device. Those devices, while unique on my network, may or maynot just look like one device (my modem) to my provider or perk.

perktv,3dinir,icudrankmy40,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"Some things I don't understand:   How they have 140 employees, but their apps still suck. Why they say they had $37 million in revenue in 2014, but adding up the quarters in their graph totals $17.6 million. They aren't even close.   I also enjoy how they completely avoid sharing how many users they have. Yes, 1 billion ad impressions is impressive, but when 90%+ of those impressions are to an empty room, that isn't too impressive. As well, if they only have paid out $10 million, then they really don't have that many active users. If there were 100k users, the average paid out so far per user would be $100. Which means I'm guessing they have a lot fewer active users than 100k.   I am personally responsible to several million of those ad impressions, and they haven't influenced any purchases or downloads. Thanks though, advertisers."

Although I'm not sure how Perk afforded the company, if the company they acquired made ~$20 million in 2014 when Perk only made $17 million. Still doesn't make much sense.   As for #1, it sounds like you're assuming all 140 are developers.   Yeah, I know they aren't all devs. You have Perk's own advertisers, a ton of business people, PR people, and of course, a panda. Seriously though, look at all of them, there are so many people. I would have thought that enough of them would be devs so they could make their app work better, but I guess not."

perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-5,Thu Jul 16 16:56:47 2015 UTC,Why do people keep ignoring the + after the 10 in the payout?  They paid out 8.2 million in 2014 and have been continuing to grow and add users since then so obviously the total number after an additional  2 quarters is going to be far in excess of 10 million.
perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Why do people keep ignoring the + after the 10 in the payout?   Actually, the fact that that number is so low concerns me. Here's why:   They paid out 8.2 million in 2014   Yes, 8.2 million. Let's assume they are at $10.5 million (they haven't reached 11 mill, otherwise they would have said 11+ million). That means for Q1 and Q2 combined, they only made $2.3 million. Uhh...both Q3 and Q4 gave out more rewards than that separately last year.  So...what does that mean? They only pay out $2.3 million in a 6 month period, when they paid out $10+ million in a 12 month period last year. So they are either losing customers, or not paying out nearly as much. I think both are true."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"Also - the big red flag to your theory is that you do not take a company public that has suffered a catastrophic loss of customers.  According to your theory they would have paid out as much in the past 6 months as they paid out in the first quarter of their start-up.  No one takes that company public and certainly, no one buys.  Obviously they have paid out far in excess of 10 million.  I seem to remember a Facebook post in the past month or so which stated that they had in fact just reached 20 million in redemptions."
perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"Are you getting Revenue and Payouts confused? Because I think you are. I'm not saying their Revenue is going down, I'm saying their Payouts are. Which does make sense. After all, they nerfed PerkTV points in January to half of what they were. Now with Live changes and now Quiz changes, payouts will get even lower. If you think Perk will gain customers when point rewards continues to go down, you're crazy.   According to your theory they would have paid out as much in the past 6 months as they paid out in the first quarter of their start-up.    This is why I think you're confused, or aren't looking at the right thing. I'm saying they paid out $2.3 million in the last 6 months. They did not pay out that much in the first quarter of their start-up. Where do you even see that?   I seem to remember a Facebook post in the past month or so which stated that they had in fact just reached 20 million in redemptions.   Source, please."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-6,Thu Jul 16 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"No, I am not getting confused.  I fully understand the difference between the two.  Reduced payouts represents a loss of membership and market share which means that you are not getting impressions and your business is collapsing.    Do you not see how if your customer base is diminishing and you now have less saturation that your continued ability to generate revenue becomes non-existent?    It's not about what the numbers are.  It's about what the trends in the numbers represent.  Your theory is flawed."
perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,4,Thu Jul 16 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"Reduced payouts represents a loss of membership and marketshare   Lol, no it doesn't. It means they are paying less. Which they are. See Perk tv, which used to be 2 points per video, and is now 1 point/video. They are paying less. Comprede? And now Quiz pays 1 point/5 questions when it used to be 2 (when running passive mode). Again, they are paying less. That doesn't mean revenue, profits, or customer count goes down at all.   They are showing the same number of videos. They don't have 'less saturation', they are just giving out less $ per video watched. Perk enticed users with high payouts. Now, they are decreasing payouts. I'm surprised you can't understand that."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-6,Thu Jul 16 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with that theory is that 1) Personally, I have seen maybe a 20% loss in points from December levels until now 2) The only way to have the catastophic loss in payouts would be to to not have gained a single user in 2015 in addition to losing  existing members.  The problem here is that you have a theory and you are trying to make the given information fit it.  You are going backasswards and I am done with this conversation."

perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,4,Thu Jul 16 18:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think I found the post you are referring to.   Perk has hit 1 Million reward redemptions! Thank you to all our Perkstars -- We've sent out over 6 Million Dollars in rewards to you this year!   So what does this mean?   I was wrong. They paid out ~$6 million in the first 6 months, not the $2.3 million like I was estimating. They have paid out ~$14.2 million up until the end of June. You were wrong. They didn't reach 20 million in redemptions. (not even close) $6 million < $8.4 million. Which means that the ""Rewards Paid"" over Q1 and Q2 of this year, has, on average, been $1.2 million less than Q4 of last year.   Thus, they are paying less. To even pay out the same as Q4 of last year, they would have had to have paid out over $8 million by the end of June. That didn't happen. Hopefully that's all the proof you need to show you that they aren't paying as much as you think."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-4,Thu Jul 16 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"No.  It means that the number is in excess of 10 million.  There are milestone numbers, 10 million, 25, 50, 100 etc.  To say 16.2 million (just a random number) would be like saying that you are 26 3/4 years old.    The piece there is not a financial disclosure which requires exact info.  It's basically a sell sheet, you just throw out enough information to open the door.  It's kind of like when they advertise a new car starting at $19.999.  We all know at the end of the day the cost will be higher but in the meantime, our interest is piqued."
perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,4,Thu Jul 16 17:48:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh...so $37 million must be a milestone, then?   $37 million revenue in 2014 and EBITDA positive   When your a fairly small and new company like Perk, you'll take whatever number can make you look better. Do you think they would write $10+ million if they had made $15 million in sales? The answer is no. Otherwise they might have said ""$35 million in revenue"", but they chose to say $37 because it is bigger.   They made $4.2 million in Q4 of 2014. If they managed to copy that success for both Q1 and Q2 of 2015, that would be $8.2 million + ($4.2 million x 2), or $16.6 million. Do you honestly believe they paid out that much, but only said they paid out ""$10+ million""?   It's pretty clear they have paid less than you are implying. It's possible that Perks revenue is increasing, but the amount they pay out to users has been decreasing."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"OK.  If your hypothesis makes sense to you, so be it.  Companies in the midst of a financial freefall are always going public right?  People are falling all over themselves to get a piece of certain ruin."
perktv,3dinir,JustFenix,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're definitely getting revenue and payouts confused."
perktv,3dinir,InternetUser007,0,Thu Jul 16 18:14:14 2015 UTC,Do we know why they are paying less and less but they now giving out 1/3 of their revenue when in q1 they gave out like 1/7?

So if they're giving the people claiming this more than 40 cents per day every single day in bonus rounds then that's a damn miracle with the number of people getting nothing or almost nothing.   But then I don't think most people know how to math properly and some think getting 2 or 4 SB bonus every day is super great, even though they'd have made more previously."

perktv,3dipy5,booyah215,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:59 2015 UTC,Swagbucks does allow more than one account per household. They have a blog post about 'great news we allow this now' from years ago.
perktv,3dipy5,prettyevil,3,Fri Jul 17 09:51:19 2015 UTC,"The swag bucks apps that run videos on devices used to allow you to favorite the really short videos so that they would repeat over and over and could run through enough videos to hit the daily limits pretty quick.  The newer updates don't allow you to favorite videos.  So far they haven't forced everybody to update to the newest app versions, no idea how long that will remain true.    Basically there are 6 Swagbucks apps that run videos.  These are Android, I'm not sure what is available via iOS.  Swagbucks TV Movies EntertainNow Sportly Indy Music Lifestyle  Limits are per household (I assume IP address) so my son and I divide them up and do 3 apps each.  Each app has it's own limit, I'm not sure what they are now but I do know they've decreased it a couple of times over the past year.  I set them  playing when I first wake up around 5am and they are usually maxed out by 6:30am.  Then if each of us have time we hop on the spare laptop and run the encrave videos from the Swagbucks website until we hit the daily goal.  If we don't have time, oh well.  We each usually earn at least one $25 gift card a month and sometimes can stretch it to an additional $25 paypal payment."

Each app can go into bonus points where you may continue to randomly earn additional points, however, it's hit or miss and you'll need to be on the updated apps (some of us run older apps that allow you to create favorites lists as we can favorite a slew of short videos to get points faster).

perktv,3dipy5,niomosy,4,Thu Jul 16 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"For just the mobile apps, I find that it's pretty heavily reliant on you being around to hit the back key to get out of many ads.  For the standard site, it's still pretty good though it shares the same problem as Perk; ad dollars are thinner right now.  nGage has been unavailable for a week or two, JunGroup videos burn out pretty quickly and Encrave occasionally runs out as well.  I've simply been supplementing by jumping onto InstaGC more and running some of their video streams (HyperMX and AdBistro are generally pretty solid/easy)."
perktv,3dipy5,niomosy,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:35:24 2015 UTC,InstaGC?
perktv,3dipy5,futuretaxmanager,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"It's another site.  The plus side is that they've got plenty of options rather similar to Swagbucks' website along with 5 video streaming options.  The survey options aren't as plentiful but are still considered pretty good as you can usually qualify for a handful of them.  They also do pay out instantly, at least on Amazon.  Click on what you want and the site gives you the code directly.  It's a bit slower than SB unless you get everything rolling but it's been a decent backup option for me as I got tired of ZoomBucks taking about a month to pay out and PrizeRebel dropped to 1 point per 10 videos on JunGroup stuff."

perktv,3dipy5,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:32 2015 UTC,No automatic videos with them.  It's like running the JunGroup / nGage videos on SwagBucks' website.  You have to click 'Next' for each video advance.

You can also do this with the mastercards at walmart as well - any gift card that has a pin can be used as a debit to load SERVE.  SERVE can be linked to your bank account and you can transfer money in and out.  There is no monthly fee on SERVE after you buy the card if you load $500 a month - it's a $1 a month otherwise.

perktv,3djf3o,MrRektid,3,Fri Jul 17 05:56:37 2015 UTC,It presents me with a $3.25 fee when attempting to use the $100 MC plus paying the $6 and some odd cents to activate it totals over $9 the money order method is still cheaper and works just fine. I guess I'd just like the convenience of Plastik and not having to wait to receive my GC and just being able to cash out any time and have the money if you're doing $25 frequently you don't really need more than that since it's impossible to legitimately earn much more than that on one account especially with the lack of ads now.  I just went ahead and ordered it if it doesn't work out it's just a dollar lost. I'll lose about $3 doing it with Plastik but the convenience of not having to wait and also having to print the Walmart cards out may be worth it since I have to make stops at the library just to print them since I'm out of ink and can't justify buying more when all I print is e gift cards haha

I do not have hard numbers just rough numbers since I don't pay close attention to the exact amount up to the cent.

perktv,3dn1fw,Eng8D,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"You go to the wifi and press and hold the specific wifi you are connected to (mobile devices do the push and hold). Then select Modify network. Check the box that says ""Show advanced settings"". That will cause more options to show up. Then change the IP settings to static. Just under that is the IP address for your device. change the last number(s) after the last period. For example, it might say now 192.168.0.4. You would change the 4 to something much higher like 50 to give you 192.168.0.50. I think you can go as high as 250 with those last numbers after the dot.   Oh and never pick 1. your router is automatically assigned 1. Your ""gateway"" (just under IP address) is your router address. Generally something like 192.168.0.1  I hope that helps and isn't too confusing."

As long as you used your real information to sign up for your Perk account then they know how old you are so there's not going to be any way to link the card to your account. If you want to try and find a way to scam and cheat the system then that's on you, but I'd recommend you just get GC's until you are old enough to get Plastik."

Theoretically, cutting out the middle man would give us all that ad revenue Perk is pulling in, but the model actually takes three separate parties to work.  Advertisers won't hand us, the ""co-op farmers,"" their ad budgets directly just like that. They'll always feel better letting a company like Perk handle it on their behalf. Spending money to advertise isn't too terribly novel an idea, but directly paying us? They'd be wary.  Perk convinced them only because we're made to appear as the general public/targets, lending an air if legitimacy.  On top of that, few start ups will be able to sustain the power users from the get go. Another start up, Unoceros, which operates on a different business model, buckled under the massive attention they received from communities like ours.  All in all, chances of such a competitor springing up overnight is very slim.   Tl;Dr : the idea won't gain traction because advertisers won't pay us directly. Plus, it's expensive to cater to so many phones."

perktv,3dl56s,PerkYou,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"True. But to be competitive, we'll need to come up with a working proof of concept, such as fully functional apps, before we can pitch it as a viable service to the advertisers and agencies. That's gonna cost some serious money and development effort.  We need initial funding for that to happen. That alone requires tons of commitment, both money and development effort.   However, once we reach that stage (not easy), we might be able to pull it off. Ads will come, probably in small amounts at first. So while we build our user base, either the ads will be spread too thin, or we must shell out more operating cost to be reasonably generous."

I average about the same per day on AppRedeem as I do for each Perk device. Maybe a little more of a good day.

All of the stores in my area stopped carrying them at the brick and mortar - they tell you to order online, and you can't price match online.   And if you show them the policy and the ad and they still deny you ask for a manager. If the manager still denies it, send a polite e-mail to WM HQ about the store and manager who are not following policy. They'll get that corrected."

But it does say that you are only meant to be pricematching an online competitor to walmart.com's store (the Family Dollar deal is brick and mortar only) and that the final decision is up to each customer care representative.

And well, by their own policy, they really aren't supposed to say no. That's why I suggested to have their policies pulled up on your phone in case they tell you no, because it's stated directly there that they have to price-match on certain terms. I do agree though, some people are going to run into problems with employees/managers not wanting to deal with it, but if you're persistent and come prepared to argue your case (if needed), then people shouldn't have too many problems. In some cases, you kind of have to ""argue"" with them if they aren't willing to help you out. I've had to do that with a manager before who didn't even know his own policies to his store, but I remained polite and patient which seemed to help haha."

perktv,3dg5g7,ThePantser,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:14 2015 UTC,This is what I thought while reading the post. What will really get their attention is competition. A business with the means to compete with Perk needs to see how much Perk is making and move on in.
perktv,3dg5g7,lostoompa,0,Thu Jul 16 01:21:20 2015 UTC,How long are you willing to wait while Perk continues squeezing more profits at your expense?
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:08:23 2015 UTC,"There is already competition that existed before them (Swagbucks has apps; run them to completion each day and you put a small, minute dent in Perk just by not running Perk at that time on that device) and there is new competition already being discussed on this very forum (Checkpoint or something like that)."
perktv,3dg5g7,a1av8r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:40 2015 UTC,Not sure Swagbucks and Checkpoints are true competition at this time. Are people turning off Perk and switching or are they adding more devices for these apps while keeping Perk running? I'm sure some with limited time and devices are switching but my guess is most will just add more devices to augment their farm. Not saying these apps or others won't become true competitors.  It would be a nice scenario if a competitor can make Perk compete for our time and resources. The question is what will it take for you to turn off Perk and go with another app for ALL your devices? I say they would have to offer better passive earnings per device and does not limit the number of devices per person.
perktv,3dg5g7,hdmiiswitch,3,Thu Jul 16 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"This is more likely than most other scenarios. The first company that comes along with relatively stable and consistent ways to earn may likely be the winner. They don't have to pay more than Perk, they just have to have more reliable apps and put their users through the wringer less often."
perktv,3dg5g7,a1av8r,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"listen to that statement. you have an unrealistic view of beermoney. the only 'stable and consistent' way to earn would be if users paid perk to play it.  the other model is advertisers. which are clearly seasonal.   advertising will always fund these guys (swagbucks, perk, checkpoints).  just comes down to which business will actually marginalize correctly to stay around long term.  some cap. some cut earnings. some go away."
perktv,3dg5g7,hdmiiswitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:35:56 2015 UTC,I understand there is a seasonal nature. You are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Seeing as how you spend the majority of your time trolling here I have no real desire to feed a troll. All I'm saying is that if some company could find a way to provide a smoother user experience then they could become very popular.
perktv,3dg5g7,Eng8D,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:31 2015 UTC,"everyone here is trolling. some are just a little more vocal than others.   and yes, i agree.  if a company could find a way to pay users tons of money every day for doing nothing, it would do well.  captain obvious."
perktv,3dg5g7,a1av8r,3,Thu Jul 16 15:24:40 2015 UTC,Maybe we should get together to find/make a Perk competitor and then promote it and foster it so that it puts the pressure on Perk. That'd be a double win.
perktv,3dg5g7,brokemember,9,Thu Jul 16 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed with you in January. Sadly, we are well past that time. Here's why:   If Perk ever sold their own ad space it was only in Perk TV. The various trailers, TV spots, etc. between ads are the only likely target. All of their current apps are utilizing ad networks. Think of it this way, an entirely separate company sets up a system to gather advertisers and show ads so companies like Perk don't need to do all that work. They then create tools and APIs so that software can serve these ads without doing all the legwork. I am certain that Perk uses LiveRail (http://www.liverail.com/) and Vungle (https://vungle.com/). There are likely others in the mix. Perk TV was more significant in January. Since then, Perk has pushed for greater diversification among all their apps. The recent changes have gone a long way to level the playing field across all apps. Perk TV no longer holds the place it once did in the ecosystem. Because Perk utilizes ad networks, contacting or launching an assault on an advertiser would likely just confuse that company. Others have said it before - most of the companies advertising on Perk likely have never even heard of it. There is too much opposition among our own ranks. Perk has a unified goal. The advertisers have a unified goal. The companies advertising have a unified goal. We are scattered with too many differing opinions to ever seriously organize. Many are happy to make even $1 per day. Some of us make ten or twenty times that. In this system or a higher earning one, $1 is still easily achievable for the most part. Therefore, probably 50% of us are already too satisfied to ever buck the trend. At the other end of the spectrum are the people who are either trolls or enjoy acting condescendingly toward other members. They are more than happy to fight the war on Perk's behalf just because it provides an opportunity to feel superior to someone else. We're just too scattered. Perk hasn't made a move that hurts everybody universally.  It is far, far too late to make an impact. We have already accepted and adapted to two major cuts. Perk knows we will accept these changes. The number of power users was significantly higher months ago. I've said it before and I'll say it again - the bored soccer mom housewives have moved in and settled. Those women bring their own large networks of other bored housewives with them. The weekly ""free"" Starbucks card feels great to them and they'll defend Perk to the death as long as those keep rolling in on a regular schedule. Don't believe me? Look into the type of users SwagBucks mostly attracts. Then read up on all of Perk's social media. It will blow your mind."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,4,Thu Jul 16 02:02:57 2015 UTC,Great insights a1av8r. Can't say I disagree with anything you said. Thanks for sharing.
perktv,3dg5g7,brokemember,5,Thu Jul 16 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify that I am not agreeing with OP's idea of going for Perk's advertisers. I am only agreeing with that fact that OP is right about us not being as powerless as some would like you to believe.    One line that I repeatedly hear is that ""we are a very small minority of Perk users and no matter what we do doesn't make a difference!""  I have said this time and time again this is not true. People severely over-estimate Perk's user base.  /u/ILikeToTerkIt linked an THIS earlier and I think everyone should give it a read .  According to Perk (and this is straight copy paste):    As of June 30, 2015, Perk US had achieved the following operating milestones:  4.5+ million installations of Perk apps  5+ billion Ad Impressions  US$10+ million in Perk Rewards paid     So lets assume Perk paid out $11 million in rewards (obviously the actual amount is less than $11 milliion — otherwise they would have written $11+ million).  Now I have always said that based on my reading and /u/internetuser007  analysis, Perk has roughly 50,000 users.  So going by that number, we get:  $10,000,000 / 50,000 = $200 per account.  That's right  if we estimate Perk's user base at 50,000 we only get $200 per account paid out in rewards.  If we assume that Perk has 100,000 users then the value per account becomes $100.  Obviously majority of people have made over $200 (a lot more). So that means Perk's user base is actually LESS than 50,000.  I am now starting to think it would be closer to half that, i.e. 25,000 active users at best.  So this subs's roughly 4500 subscribers make 18% of Perk's users. Not to mention they are probably the more dedicated ones.  So whatever action we do take DOES have an impact on Perk.  The whole argument that we are too small to count holds no water.    I highly suggest that people read the post linked above. And do the math yourselves.  You will realize that when OP states we are not powerful, he/she is right on the money.  I don't necessarily agree with all the points and suggestions — but I felt that it is important people realize that this sub does have some say to achieve things.  All we need is cohesion and slight patience."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,2,Thu Jul 16 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"We may have some pull to change things on PERK. Probably by just stopping Perking for a few days (what this post specifically says not to do), but you'd have a hard time convincing even a majority of people here to stop for a few days. That would still be a far more viable plan than what's here. And would have a better chance of succeeding if worded something like ""everyone switch phones to Checkpoint/swagbucks/insert other program here for 3 days! Stick it to Perk and show them we have options!""   We do not have enough of a pull to hurt any of the advertisers (which is what this post is suggesting) because the advertisers we see often all have 1000/10,000s of reviews already up, some of which are already negative. A tiny bump in negatives, for an entirely unrelated beef with an almost entirely unrelated company is not going to hurt those companies enough to take anything out on Perk (if they even realize it's happening because of Perk).    You will realize that when OP states we are not powerful, he/she is right on the money.    I think you meant powerless."
perktv,3dg5g7,brokemember,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:52:09 2015 UTC,Like I said    I don't necessarily agree with all the points and suggestions   I just thought it was important that people realize that Perk's user base is not as big as some people will lead you to believe.
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"It'd be a better point to make on a better suggestion then. The point that we're not powerless against Perk is sort of drowning in the fact that this user is suggesting we attack third-parties that aren't Perk. (Third-parties our userbase is definitely not big enough to hurt.)  The only truly viable way to hurt Perk is to stop people from Perking, but that's an idea this user is 100% advising against.   Basically nothing in this plan is viable as an actual strategy. It's either going to accomplish nothing or get people banned from Perk (and potentially the Play Store for abusive, off-topic reviews) for abusing ad providers. Or, hilariously, they will use this as yet another reason they have to cut our payout 'those cheaters we had to cut pay to punish before are now abusing our ad providers for using us so we have to cut your pay again'."

The point that we're not powerless against Perk is sort of drowning in the fact that this user is suggesting we attack third-parties that aren't Perk.   Agree. I just posted here since I read a few people say how insignificant our numbers are. Just wanted to set that right.   The only truly viable way to hurt Perk is to stop people from Perking   That's what I always suggest. A couple of days not Perking are worth it.
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"I think the people mentioning numbers here are actually mentioning them in comparison to the number of users the various advertisers have compared to Perk users.   As /u/tanktur pointed out, an app with 880k+ reviews, 150k+ of which are already negative reviews, is not going to notice even if we get a 100% participation rate of the 50k or less Perk users.   Hurting the advertisers (whether you like them or not, just do it because the group said to) is a terrible idea strategically. Plus ethical ramifications.   I'd rather organize a short walkout. ""Next week, on Tuesday, everyone change to Checkpoint for the day and we'll all compare our earnings and see if it competes with previous earnings from Perk."" Even a one day walkout would be felt by Perk far more than poking sticks at random advertisers who have way more users than Perk. And it's an alternative rather than just a cease and desist; so people who NEED the money (raises hand) don't feel torn between paying for groceries or taking a stance."

perktv,3dg5g7,TankTur,2,Thu Jul 16 08:56:41 2015 UTC,"The problem I see with this is we aren't directly hurting perk by hurting the advertiser. If anything were helping because if you get bad reviews on a product you would want to have consumers overlook that and you would do that via more advertizing. Also, hurting a company would have minor effects on perk because they probably spend a small portion of their ad budget on ads at perk."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"The strategy calls for minor affects on Perk to get their respect and to stop devaluing our time and resources, just enough to let them know we can impact their bottom line. The message we send is we can impact their bottom line and can escalate to more companies if needed. They don't want that to happen because it's a lose lose lose proposition. You do not want to harm Perk to extent to put them out of business because all parties lose. Right now they don't respect and value the Consumers enough. They are taking a bigger cut at our expense from each ad viewed."
perktv,3dg5g7,TankTur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:28 2015 UTC,"That makes sense but we have to make sure they know why its happening. And still they could just get more ads since the reviews go down, the advertisers might compensate with more ads."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:36 2015 UTC,"The most effective strategy would be the one we have no hope to pull off. Long story short people would need to stop perking. With less users, perk would have to raise rates. This will never work, reason being as you stop perking, more ads become available to another person making them more money. Also this board has lets say 4500 members, not all active. Perk screen alone is rated to have 500,000 download, assuming 5 per account, we dont have the attention of even 10% of the user base. With no way to reach enough users I don't see what could be done as a group. As an individual though you have your own rights to continue or not however."

But we have no way to know for sure, plenty of people report making 50-100 points a day from only using 1 phone. However, even if we have lets say 18% of the user base here, I don't believe they are active, nor do I think we have the power to organize anything effective. A lot of people believe this to be ""free money"" still. The information you posted is extremely interesting however. Thanks for sharing it!"
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,0,Thu Jul 16 18:22:51 2015 UTC,I won't comment on a strategy that you said has no hope of pulling off. ;-) We don't need to reach thousands of Perk users. Let's take your numbers and say we send 450 people or even 45 people to leave negative feedback on an app (pick one) at the Google Playstore. People read reviews before purchasing. I know I do. You don't think that company will cease to do business with Perk because of the negative publicity it has brought them?
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"Only if you definitively tell them you have left it because of Perk. And quite frankly, if I saw many reviews of people saying they were downvoting one thing because of a totally different and only minorly related thing, I'd think those people were friggin' nutbags.   And by doing that, you'd also be revealing your abuse of their ad providers to Perk and instead of suffering at the hands of that ad company they turn around, ban you and say ""we took care of those abusive people. They won't be bothering you again.""   And that's not even taking into account that you want to simultaneously heap praise onto another company."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,3,Thu Jul 16 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"Prettyevil's post does offer a pretty decent reason as to a flaw. One other thing though to consider. Let's say you decided to go after Game of War. They are advertised here, Swagbucks and many other places. Currently they have 880k+ reviews, 135k reviews are already negative, 450 more people or 45 leaving a negative review I dont think is going to cut it. I think if you could muster some numbers, you might be able to get your voice heard.   It is good people are brainstorming, I hope someone does come up with the answer. But at the end of the day, I am inclined to think these ideas wont work. The bigger problem not yet discussed is the fact people are grateful to be earning any money at all. The prominent and dangerous thought that exists with these programs is ""this is free money"". That idea really needs to die, but as long as people view this as ""free money"". I think you are going to have a tough time with any idea."
perktv,3dg5g7,JustFenix,0,Thu Jul 16 02:12:45 2015 UTC,"Good point about Game of War being too big for us to make a difference. Maybe there is an easier target to make our impact felt.  You may be right that the breaking point has not been reached for people to stop being grateful. Unfortunately, Perk will continue to squeeze more out of us until that time."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:27:12 2015 UTC,"The only 'easy target' will be a very tiny business or a solo-developer. They will not be able to turn around and hurt Perk because they got hurt. These 'easy targets' are easy because they have limited funds, limited resources, small if any PR and management skills.   Instead, you'd drive them out of business, period, because what might have been their first breakout attempt to get big was crapped on for a reason that had nothing to do with them and hid it from users who would have been interested in whatever they were selling.   Think of it this way, you spent months and months learning to code and made your first game app that you are super proud of, and it's actually super well done. And you manage to save up a few $1000 to advertise it - you may even take a bank loan to do it. You go through an ad placement agency. This agency puts you on Perk - you did not make this conscious decision, you just wanted the agency to put you out there to be seen.   Suddenly you have 10, 20, 30, 50 bad reviews overtaking the tiny handful of good reviews you've managed to gain from truly interested parties. You have no idea why unless they mention Perk. You have no idea what the hell Perk is. You beg Google to remove these off-topic reviews, but Google won't because you aren't big enough to care about. You'll get a form letter, at best.   So you figure out what Perk is. You talk to Perk and beg them to deal with their users, stop showing your ads if their users are going to attack you instead of them. Perk doesn't care about you because you're small. You'll get a form letter asking for your Perk account number and to send your ID to confirm your account (because no one probably even read it and saw what your real complaint was; they think you're just another disgruntled user of their apps). The only way to save yourself is to cut your losses and cancel your advertising bid - which you may lose the money on because they don't give refunds.   Too bad. You got involved with a company you had no idea existed and their userbase fucked you over. You're out of your money, potentially still have to pay a loan back now, your new app is downrated so badly not many are going to risk DLing and your dreams of developing are up in smoke."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,0,Thu Jul 16 03:50:17 2015 UTC,How about this for an easier target:  Pick a movie trailer that Perk's been pushing.  Go to YouTube to leave a negative feedback. Say something to the effect that you will boycott the movie after seeing the trailer through Perk. The movie producer will take notice after a few hundred negative comments and figure out their association with Perk has given them bad publicity. Maybe they will in turn make Perk feel a little pain by hitting them where it hurts.
perktv,3dg5g7,TheBlueRajasSpork,2,Thu Jul 16 10:53:37 2015 UTC,They pay to have 5 star reviews on Google play and they also pay for Facebook likes.
perktv,3dg5g7,JustFenix,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"Retaliating against advertisers seems quite counterproductive.  It's like saying that we're going to try and take away a source of revenue for Perk in order to get them to pay us more money.  It doesn't even make sense.  Anyway, I think all of their advertising comes from brokers so this is really pointless.  I do agree that we have at least some influence.  The January 'chance to earn 0 points' debacle was at least changed, but I think the huge amount of negative reviews for the Perk apps in the the various app marketplaces had more to do with that than anything.  I think that's our only real leverage now, as they have their social media stooges in place."
perktv,3dg5g7,prettyevil,0,Thu Jul 16 03:39:08 2015 UTC,"We agree that we don't have much leverage over Perk directly. However, I believe we have leverage over the advertisers who in turn have leverage over Perk even with brokers. I get it that I have not been very convincing on those later points. I believe we should follow the money. The party writing the checks has the leverage over the recipient."
perktv,3dg5g7,JustFenix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"Attacking one ad provider while praising another (both regardless of whether you like that company or not or whether that company is personally doing anything wrong or right) seems to defeat the purpose of attacking the first one at all.   It sounds more like it would be ultimately very confusing. Like someone who kicks their dog at random then gives the dog treats at random, even when the dog just crapped on the floor. Such behavior, studied in animals, leads to animals who are confused - eager to please, poorly behaved and hesitant to actually do anything at all.   And for Perk specifically with this method, it sounds like they would lose nothing. One company will be mad at them and potentially leave (though incredibly unlikely as Premium members and apologists will come to the rescue if they notice, or are pointed toward, a company that is being attacked for using Perk), the other will be over the moon happy and buy more. Perk makes up the loss if there is a loss at all."
perktv,3dg5g7,yarmatey,0,Thu Jul 16 00:41:05 2015 UTC,The strategy does not call for praising one company while at the same time bashing another. We are either in retaliation mode (the stick) when we are unhappy or cooperation mode (the carrot) when we are happy with Perk.   Premium members may side with Perk but I doubt many will fight for advertisers because they have little incentive.
perktv,3dg5g7,PerkAccount,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"You might want to review what you've said then. You make no distinction about when these plans should be implemented.    Do retaliate against advertisers.   and   Do offer carrots to foster a win win win relationship. Pick one advertiser periodically and have the community reward it with positive feedback all over the internet. Remember it's not a matter of whether you like or dislike the company. It's a business decision and strategic plan execution.   You will not even manage to garner enough support on a forum of this size (which doesn't even have all the subscribers to it visiting on a regular basis, some not at all anymore) to cause an impact to any large company that can afford the advertising budget to advertise with Perk for any significant amount of time. At best you would manage to pick the weakest link, like a small mom and pop company who won't have the income or pull to 'hurt' Perk in any way. Instead you just tanked some small company for your selfish desire to hurt an unrelated company.   The incentive for Perk Premium users is that Perk seems to direct and point them toward things. When they knew shit would hit the fan during the Live changes, they had people posting things they bought with Perk (even totally unrealistic and eyerolling things that were probably not bought with Perk). Perk points them toward an advertiser to give love to and they will flock over because Mama Perk told them to.   You are not the strategist you think you are. You really, really aren't. And even if you were, Perk has a team of strategists and PR people that are better."

Clench your butthole and be prepared for rational people to criticize the idea. If you can't take criticism, don't make bad suggestions.   It's not a personal attack that I think your idea is bad. It's not a personal attack that I think you're not as good at strategizing as you boast you are in your OP - that's just a simple fact since this is a terrible, terrible 'strategy'.

Do not make ridiculous accusations after claiming you're not going to personally attack me. (I misread passionate as pessimistic, for that I apologize).   I fight for little people. You are actively trying to damage little people so long as the little person isn't you. You are a giant, selfish hypocrite that only sees their own benefit. You are a disgusting example of a human being thinking you can try to mount an attack on  individuals then accusing someone who disagrees of not defending the little people because you think you can turn them into your personal weapon if you guilt, shame and redirect them just right. NASTY! You want a personal, but very accurate 'attack' on you, have it.   Bet you're the kind that thinks slapping and hitting a baby punishes the mother, aren't you? Because by hurting an independent developer or taking a run at a tiny mom and pop company (the easy targets you keep proposing you want to target) that's what you're doing.

You have a terrible idea that is attempting to actively hurt little people in the hopes it will hurt Mama Perk. It will not because Mama Perk only cares about the big companies that advertise with it. You are still incredibly selfish, and manipulative (though very bad at it) for trying to 'redirect' me toward your own goals while saying I'm not fighting for the little people. When in fact, standing against you is fighting for the little people. Just not the little people you want me to fight for -ie. you.   You want to know how to direct me to fight against Perk instead, read this. It's the only viable tactic that the userbase could mount that won't hurt someone else entirely without Perk even noticing. But I'm perfectly capable of directing myself to it. If someone wants to rally a day Checkpoint, Swagbucks, insert other sites here, I'll get on board and compare numbers at the end of the day."

Unionizing random people over the Internet is a pretty difficult task. The only thing that's going to increase payouts is a scarcity of people using perk or a company to move in and compete with perk. And that won't be happening until 4Q and the holiday advertising budgets. You sound like the fast food workers striking for $15/hour.

Stop acting like Perk has an obligation to line your pockets with unthinkable amounts of effortless spending cash. They haven't done anything that we shouldn't be expecting. You really expect $30 dollars a day per account to be sustained? Come on.  Its pretty simple. You do this, what they lay out for you, until it isn't worth it anymore.

perktv,3dhrjk,samsqanch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:45:15 2015 UTC,"One of the things that made it so maddening was that not everyone had the problem at the same time, it seemed like it rolled out slowly, no matter what version people were using.  I lost detection 3-4 weeks ago, some lost it 2 weeks and some never lost it.    No one has figured out what the issue is, there were tons of theories and lots of people fiddling, but nothing solved it until perk changed things on their end on the 8th, that’s when it started working again for most.    It still doesn’t work as well as it did last month though.  It activates alright and detects commercials for me, but will only play 1-2 ads then goes back to circles until the next commercial.  Tom make things even stranger, the app will only ever work when I’m watching live TV on my actual TV, if I’m using netflix or watching on my computer, it refuses to activate or detect commercials, no idea why."

Would you merge with one that appears that its' user base is revolting?  Nothing closes wallets and causes panic sales faster than instability in a tech-driven startup.  Boycotts are meant to change the core behavior of a company or to drive it out of business: they are not to be taken lightly.  In this case, the boycott you are trying to arrange is intended to make their company less profitable by paying more for product.  Perk, to investors, is a risky dot-com company.  So, in the midst of a planned and anticipated merger, you are trying to arrange the equivalent of a  wage strike.  If you are successful and get their attention, then you will also be getting the attention of their VCs and merger backers as well, signalling an unstable company.  Nothing closes wallets and causes panic sales faster than instability in a tech-driven startup.

Maybe perk will put out a tapping app that the cats can work themselves for.  :)  What brand of catfood do you use?   Have you signed up for coupons on their website? I get $5 a month for my dogs and have found shopping online with petsmart can save a bunch over instore.  Managed to basically get 40% off on my brand and was able to keep reordering to stock up enough for a few months.   Wasn't cheap, but 40% less off a fixed cost is pretty sweet.   Hope they start swimming in mackrel again soon."

perktv,3dhap8,Sychophantom,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:04 2015 UTC,Cats can be such picky eaters. Science diet is ok but my vet has never been in love with it.  He liked the Wellness brand when i had mine.   Amazon offers science diet though for only $1 a can if that helps you stretch your dollar.

Snowballs have better luck in hell, but many were just happy to no longer have the 0 pointers..... Guess what, they'll be back.

Science Diet is pretty shitty, albeit being highly recommended by a lot of Veterinarians.  My best guess is that, just like doctors who prescribe shit meds in order to get kickbacks from Pharmaceutical companies, Vets get kickbacks from recommending shitty brands with healthy-sounding names.    Cats aren't omnivorous, they're carnivorous.  You should really have them on a strictly grain-free diet.  Wellness is what I feed my cat, but there are other good brands such as Blue Buffalo that you can look into.  If you buy in bulk ($50 or more) it's free shipping and that 20% discount really helps.  Next time you want to make a purchase and still want that 20% discount, just make a new email/account.  They don't cross-check phone numbers or addresses for the order and you're good to go!"

UHRS is Microsoft and they have crowdsourcing work that mainly deals with search engine optimization. For instance, on just one of many Hitapps, you look at a search query someone input, and then an ad query that populates, and judge the relevance on their scale from Excellent to Bad. I look at ""shoes"" then ""Nike shoes"" and click ""good"" and get $0.05, or 50 Perk points. This is simplifying it to some extent, as some search terms as for queries that you don't quite understand, but for the most part, it is minimal time. You may have to click a link on both sides to see what they are talking about, because it populates search results for both for comparison as well. Another is Search Engine Battles which compare search results between two different search engines and you judge which is better. Or how adult a page is, aka how much pornography does it have. There are way too many to count. They come up in batches at various times and frequently throughout the day.  So, if you put in ""time and effort"", rewards sites may not be the absolute best way to go 100% of the time. There are times when Mturk and UHRS do not have a lot of work available, and then you may want to turn to other sources, but I feel like this whole, ""best pay for your effort"" can be somewhat misguided, if you intend on actually putting in a lot of effort. It's not unusual for people to get really good at Hitapps on UHRS and make $12-15 an hour. So, it depends on what you want to do, I guess."

I don't claim to a marketing expert, but I honestly think about 80% of this sub isn't thinking things through, have never heard of the term 'fiscal quarter' (understandable), or they have absolutely no clue how advertising works. And while I believe Perk has deployed some tactics in order to pocket extra cash, there are some plain-as-day clues that should have hinted you in the direction that they aren't just suddenly changing things to piss off it's userbase, or otherwise turn them away.  I mean some people are literally looking past the fact that PerkTV recently has shown literally NO ADS for most of the day. Hmm..I wonder why that is? Could it be because a shortage of ads, maybe? Or has Perk gone psychotic and have now decided they don't want to show us the video ads anymore, cut 15-30 seconds of time, and let it play straight to trailers? You decide.  Also, didn't Swagbucks recently make an influx of changes, too? I never used SB. But are you thinking it could be a conspiracy?"

Truthfully, the only thing that aggravates me is that all users don't earn at the same rate. My coworker earns substantially more with fewer phones (same model phones) than I do. I suspect it is because he is a new user and they are trying to get the hooks in him. I don't appreciate being bullshitted by a company either. If ads are fewer, just tell us. If the company is losing money (which I doubt) and they need to lower payouts, then do it. We would all rather have some money than no money. And finally, back to the bullshit, don't try to claim hackers are the reason for lowering payouts and that this ""self-policing"" army of video watchers and tappers somehow have anything to do with how some dipshit in Zimbabwe is gaming their systems.

Nope, terrifying).   Perk, Swagbucks, etc. give me a chance to feel like I'm contributing to the household, like I'm not such a huge, useless drain on my father and society. I work as much as my dad does at his real job, and I bring in only a fraction of what he does, but I'm not being useless.

perktv,3d9y5r,ChewRoll,2,Tue Jul 14 19:48:24 2015 UTC,That's a pretty slimy way to get more 'confirmed' ad views; punishing people actually using the app.
perktv,3d9y5r,InternetUser007,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"Not really.  90% of the time it's an ad you can immediately X out of rather than having to sit through 30 seconds of a standard ad but for some reason people are so busy bitching about the format of the ad that they fail to mention that as ads go, it's the better option."
perktv,3d9y5r,JustFenix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"No, this definitely ads to their 'X many people actually saw ads' count. You can count how many people clicked an ad, and thus saw it. It's tougher to count how many people did or did not watch an ad that you don't need to 'x' out of."
perktv,3d9y5r,InternetUser007,2,Tue Jul 14 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"I understand that.  My point is that that the X out ads (up until today, it may have changed but as late as last night it was this way) only apear  when you are actually playing the game and they are like the old static ads with Live, you can X them out rather than having to sit through a traditional 30 second ad. It's actually a good thing since it lets you move to the next game faster.  Also like the old static ads on Live, it times out after 30 seconds and moves on to the next game if you  don't hit the X.      People are seeing an ad with an X and labeling it bad without paying attention to it's process."

perktv,3d9y5r,ozone63,2,Wed Jul 15 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah...... It would be one thing if they were stable and ran for a while, but with how often they crash now AND chopping points in half this  probably isn't worth it.  I'm already using checkpoints on about 8 phones, and that is actually passive. You rarely do anything after putting in the time to make all of the email addresses. Although I know if pays shittier, semi-passive was why I came to perk, and it's been turning into a nightmare.   Now the payout is becoming as bad as checkpoints, and I have to reset/interact frequently. I'm going to collect earning data over the next few days and actually make a decision if it's worth it for me to run quiz. My hunch is it wont be."
perktv,3d9y5r,ozone63,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:27 2015 UTC,if PPQ runs well you still should be able to get 4800 points a day. I haven't had to reset mine yet since they changed whatever they did serverside. so here is hoping.

I think I have been recently getting about that much having to reset them very often (not sure of the exact breakdown, but i've been getting about 8000-9000 points per day from 5 on quiz, 5 on tv).

Then as much as I would like to bitch about the points decrease, I couldn't because there wouldn't be a better option out there (checkpoints is only around 40-45 cents per day, per device in my experience. Albeit completely passive)."
perktv,3d9y5r,ozone63,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:30 2015 UTC,checkpoints have a device limit?

It's a pain to set up, but after that its just about writing all of the email addresses down somewhere so you don't forget them.  See my comment below about earnings. I know they are a lot lower than perk, but I had some extra phones and it made sense to try it out when TvLive took a shit (or when you aren't home to run live)."

That's 1 point every 3 min or 20pts/hr or 480pts/day. How is it that you can only get 40-45 a day? Does it freeze alot or something or do the ad lengths change? Or do they screw you on the actual points you get? (The app says the daily video limit is 500). TIA

perktv,3d9y5r,ozone63,2,Wed Jul 15 00:17:18 2015 UTC,thats a load of crap you can have 5 per app per account but I dont think theres much of a point these days
perktv,3d9y5r,montr0n,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:30:49 2015 UTC,I'm curious about your Checkpoints set up. I started up 2 new Moto Gs yesterday with fresh accounts (20pts each) and got 100 points in a non-stop 24 hour period. Doing the math on exchanges it seems I'll cash out every 2.5 months if I never stop Checkpointing which feels like an eternity.
perktv,3d9y5r,ozone63,3,Tue Jul 14 19:29:08 2015 UTC,"I consistently get 120-150 points per day (335 checkpoints= $1) on the following devices:  -Ipod touch (whatever gen the front face camera is)  -Iphone 4s  -Moto G  -LG fuels and LG Optimus Zone 2 with checkpoints side loaded (you need to download the apk, because for some reason google play store says the app in incompatible).  I cashed out a $1 gift card on all of the accounts to make sure they weren't going to give me problems with all of the phones coming from the same IP (didn't want to fuck myself and save for $10 card, only to be banned). No problems with redemption.  So it seems like each device will accrue a $10 gift card every 22-27 days.  **Edit: OH, and make sure you don't login to any checkpoints account (even from a desktop) to check your points. It will logout the account on your device for some reason and stop awarding points. It will still sit there and play the videos, but it will not accrue points. Wasted quite a bit of time before I figured that one out."
perktv,3d9y5r,montr0n,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:49 2015 UTC,So just cash out at $10. I have 2 moto gs already running the app and I sideloaded a few Fuels when I got them actually. $10 a month isn't amazing but it can run passively when I'm in the office or sleeping so I may work those Fuels into the mix and drop the 2 running tv for 2 hours during my workdays. (and at night though I hardly sleep 5 hours)
perktv,3d9y5r,gorgonzoler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:05 2015 UTC,How are you and /u/Hou5eR getting that many points off 10 devices? Even if I am babysitting them basically all day (5 ppq and 5 tv) I'm lucky to break 6000 :/. Maybe it's time for a new router and modem...
perktv,3d9y5r,Truth_Tella,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:27:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it's the type of phones, or just luck.  Funny enough (I almost can't believe it myself) I am using the ""shitty"" comcast router/modem combo after my old router took a shit. I have 18 phones connected, my personal phone, a couple of laptops, and a chrome cast all connected. Everything is running really well. I stream Netflix to the chromecast without issue, none of my devices timeout, and get damn good speed test results.  I hardly know anything about network management, routing, etc, so I can't really tell you why it's working so well. But I'm not sure I'd invest in a new router (if I were you) for a couple extra bucks from perk, especially with all of the changes now."

I have a separate router so its not too bad, but I've thought about getting my own modem anyway. After 6 months it pays for itself and I'm saving 10$ a month.

perktv,3d9y5r,kenjiwing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:52 2015 UTC,5 quiz phones are Moto G's which work really well. 5 Tv phones are fuels.  What bandwidth are you paying for? I have the 50 mbps package.

I ran it all night non stop and only get less than 40 pts. $1 Amazon is 335 pts. 500 pts is almost $1.5 in Amazon so that's a lot.

perktv,3dda6l,Hou5eR,-3,Wed Jul 15 12:08:53 2015 UTC,"They reduced the amount of points you can earn from 2 to 1 (through lighting mode) so... yes, in a way there's a ""max daily limit"" which I believe is 300. Once you reach 300, it reduces the points you can earn to 1 per question. Hence why I'm trying to get around the changes."
perktv,3dda6l,Hou5eR,5,Wed Jul 15 12:13:30 2015 UTC,no that would be perk tv live you are talking about unless there is some daily limit bs about PPQ that hasn't been mentioned.

My plan was to max out to 300 points per account, then switch over to the next account and do the same. Then once finished, just stay logged in and let it run on whichever account until it resets.

perktv,3d9pn5,ThePantser,3,Tue Jul 14 16:27:18 2015 UTC,Only admins can do that. Sub mods can only ban from their own particular subs.  This sub needs a mod and hdmiswitch is not the only reason.
perktv,3d9pn5,brokemember,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Sub mods can only ban from their own particular subs.   Is the mod ban a form of shadowban, or does the sub just not let you in if you are banned by a mod?"
perktv,3d9pn5,InternetUser007,3,Tue Jul 14 18:16:15 2015 UTC,"Shadowban is done by reddit admins and basically turns the account in to a ghost. They think they can post etc, but no one else sees anything. In a way they won't even know they are shadow banned — it will just seem like everyone  is ignoring them.  A subs mod ban basically means the person can visit (unless it's a private sub), but they can't post. In this case they will know they have been banned."
perktv,3d9pn5,brokemember,0,Tue Jul 14 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Shadowban is done by reddit admins and basically turns the account in to a ghost   Huh, I've been shadowbanned from a sub before, for nothing more than disagreeing with someone (in a respectful manner, I might add). I contacted the mods, and within an hour, I was no longer shadowbanned. I wonder what happened in the background. If what you say is true, did the mods have to contact an admin to get me un-shadowbanned?"
perktv,3d9pn5,InternetUser007,3,Tue Jul 14 18:27:34 2015 UTC,Regular mods can't shadowban.  Shadowban means you can't post anywhere on reddit (well you could but no one other than you would see those posts) — shadowbans cover reddit completely...not just a particular sub.  You must've been just banned from that particular sub — by the sub's mods.  Only way to get a shadowban removed is by pleading to reddit admins.
perktv,3d9pn5,brokemember,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm...interesting. I could still post in the sub just fine. However, using incognito mode, I couldn't see my posts, and people were not responding to anything I wrote. So...I'm not sure how that worked."
perktv,3d9pn5,InternetUser007,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:45:02 2015 UTC,That sound like a shadowban.  Were you able to post else where and see it in incognito mode?
perktv,3d9pn5,brokemember,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe so. At least I don't remember having any problems in any other sub. This was ~1.5 years ago, so maybe something was slightly different back then."
perktv,3d9pn5,InternetUser007,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:37 2015 UTC,Shadowbanning might not be such a bad idea...of course people could just stop responding to him but that might make a little too much sense for some of those other people in this sub.

There's never a surefire way to have a private community by publicly advertising it."
perktv,3dajy2,PerkAccount,2,Tue Jul 14 21:14:28 2015 UTC,Users should have a post and comment history here though.
perktv,3dajy2,ScienceGuyBillNye,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"True, but perk could also just use one of their employee accounts that supposedly scours this reddit, and make a couple more posts or something. It's a good idea, but for perfect execution, you would have to have the users PM other active, and helpful users to get into the private subreddit. That would be an almost perfect way to do it."
perktv,3dajy2,NotRonJeremy,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"It's being suggested as well below, I would like the PMing members but I felt that I may be putting them on the spot. Also, even if I PM, I still can;t be sure if they are just ""posing"" as regular member, there's just no fool-proof way. This way is more voluntary and it's a ""word of honor"" thing."
perktv,3dajy2,stevil30,2,Wed Jul 15 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"How exactly are you going to have a good ""profitability discussion"" without including subjects that break Perk TOS?  You're never going to break into 4-digit monthly earnings without bending the rules a little.  I'd think the best approach would be to hand-pick people based on post history rather than an open application process.  The downside to this is that some of the most knowledgeable and experienced ""power users"" (or whatever term you prefer) aren't going to be regular posters in this sub.  Going from knowing how to run Perk apps on your phone to scaling to large enough farms to make the whole endeavor worthwhile isn't trivial and requires a fair amount of research as well as trial and error.  There's some initial research into which apps are more suitable for what you're trying to accomplish and then from there figuring out how to streamline things efficiently.  Quite frankly the important considerations when you've reached that point are very different from what is commonly discussed in this sub so unless you enjoy the minor entertainment value it provides most of their discussion is either via PMs or small groups of like minded people."
perktv,3dajy2,NotRonJeremy,2,Tue Jul 14 22:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. Profitability is subjective, so personally, I have not narrowed it down. But on a more ""obvious"" level is to discuss which phone works best for certain/all apps. That way, if the current gen good phones are phased out/out of stock, members can just ask which are the good ones. Stability = better earning = profitability. It's not always about hard ""how much can I earn"" question.  As for not breaking ToS, it can be done. A good example is PPQ, we know that it can be done passive, and Perk say they don't allow extended period of inactivity. So say, you went for a bathroom break or just got too focused watching TV and left PPQ running, that isn't breaking ToS. However, leaving PPQ running un-attended 24x7 is I believe, breaking ToS because no one can stay focused on the app even if trhey are just actively watching the Ads.  Handpicking is good too, and I will consider that. However, I do not want to put anyone on the spot as they may not like the idea. So a voluntary approach is the one I decided to take.  Again, the main idea of the sub is not to further endanger current ""vets"" and ""pros"" by making any other discussions ""private"". If the vets decided to join and share, that's well and good, if not, no hard feelings too."

perktv,3desgc,Kommander1,3,Wed Jul 15 18:39:38 2015 UTC,I read that in John Maddens voice. He he.. He he here's a guy who wants to gain points and lose points at the same time. he he.. that's like going in reverse in drive! He he!

perktv,3dcrnt,gunnerandhash,3,Wed Jul 15 09:34:36 2015 UTC,we're just hearing one side of the story. i think people who are quick to claim they will exploit as an act of vengeance were probably exploiting in the first place.
perktv,3dcrnt,prettyevil,0,Wed Jul 15 15:52:02 2015 UTC,"Good point. I exploited when I just started too, so he's kind of right to begin with. I tried with new accounts many times: I think 5 or 6. This one will be next cause it's just easier to start over instead of waiting, even if you aren't exploiting and complying with rules; the support people are way too lazy nowadays, compared to when I just started and they took less than 5 hours to respond each time. It's not really vengeance tbh tho, I'd say more of a typical consumer reaction. You guys are just more patient because you all love perk so much, and I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying that there's some people like me who are not as patient.   And please don't call me a 12 year old because of that, I just turned 18"
perktv,3dcrnt,prettyevil,3,Wed Jul 15 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"You may be chronologically 18, but you behave like a 12 or under.   If this method of yours isn't working, hasn't been working and you keep getting in trouble, then most people would step back and look at that and say 'this doesn't seem to be working, perhaps I should try a different tactic'.   Instead of fucking up new accounts over and over, because they are going to be able to figure out it's you, you dingus, keep one and correct whatever mistakes you are making. It's a sign of good will and good behavior to correct the mistakes rather than switching to a new account (again, they can tell it's you eventually, you are not escaping a flag for long, and therefore compounding your problems!).   Or keep behaving like an idiotic tween (not a typical consumer as you want to pretend). Whatever floats your boat."
perktv,3dcrnt,prettyevil,0,Thu Jul 16 00:21:49 2015 UTC,"See my only mistake seemed to be fastforwarding; I stopped doing so, but I still seemed to fuck up somewhere. Worst part? They won't even tell me what it is: they just quietly ban me without any comments or answers as of WHAT did I do wrong? Since when is self improvement is a bad thing? I'm just being curious. Or if they don't answer and I need to pay up for that item on eBay, I just gotta wait for their majesty to reply, knowing that all they'd do is eventually quietly ban me without comments? I will not believe if you tell me I'm the only one who gets that treatment from customer service..  Oh and if you're younger than ME telling me that I act like a 12 years old then fuck you. If you're older though, I'll respect you saying that.. guess I'm still too young to understand some of the things."
perktv,3dcrnt,prettyevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:01:36 2015 UTC,"What you did wrong was, now bare with me, I can see how this is a difficult concept to tackle, you made additional accounts. And then you kept making additional accounts. And then you kept making even more.   You are not practicing self-improvement by repeatedly opening new accounts to try and escape your old bad mistakes. Self-improvement requires accepting the mistakes you made previously and improving despite them. By hiding behind new accounts, whether you were displaying improved behavior or not, you were breaking a whole new set of rules by having more accounts than allowed while trying to hide that you broke rules before.  I have 10 years on you. I'm still young in the grand scheme of things, but even if I were younger than you (perhaps even more so if I was younger than you) you should have respected what I said since what I said was grow up and handle your shit instead of running from it and restarting without permission - good life advice for anything short of the mafia trying to kill you (in that case, please do run and start over somewhere else with a new name)."

perktv,3dahgu,NotRonJeremy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:25 2015 UTC,I found it only limited you to one account per phone number when signing up and trying to refer one account to another.   Just skip the referral stuff and you can cash out many accounts with 1 number.
perktv,3dahgu,TheWoman2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"The only part of this app I've really explored are the movie trailers and one beef I have with it is that although the app tells you that you earn points on a per video basis it's actually per ad.  If there are lots of ads available it will alternate between trailers and ads.  Although points are credited to your account following the ads, the pop-up telling you that you earned points doesn't come up until after the next trailer finishes playing (to maintain the illusion that it's the trailers earning the points).  Unfortunately if there aren't a lot of ads it just keeps playing movie trailers without awarding you any points.  Once I tried running it overnight and was only served three ads the entire time (despite videos playing all night).  At least with Perk TV they're nice enough to not load either (and waste your bandwidth) if they're not prepared to pay you to watch."
perktv,3dahgu,NotRonJeremy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:34 2015 UTC,I get a popup several times a day saying it cant play an add and have to click ok on it so its really not passive for me.

Then do the same on PPQ for the same amount of time.   There, you have an answer. My guess is you're going to have to reset PPQ phones more often than every 2 hours (the interval that's required to interact with the TV phones), so for me it would be more worth it to choose the more passive option."

How does one check a phone that doesn't turn on? My guess is the business is much larger than he can handle without hiring a few more help.  For his credit, he's very quick to correct the problem though. But guy's gotta be losing money on shipping. Better to do a quality check on the phones before sending them out."

The trick, of course, is finding advertisers who would be willing to have people passively running the app -- and ignoring their ads. So there's that."

perktv,3db6od,JustFenix,2,Tue Jul 14 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"Great idea...on paper. The logistics of it are astounding. Passive and making decent cash would have customers coming to you in droves with large farms. You would have to be ready for that huge influx of bandwidth. Plus, they would do exactly what is being done to perk now, except you would be footing the bill. Large farms, nobody watching and you send them checks for it. Still sound like the sound of it?  As much as it sucks what Perk is doing (and it does indeed suck) from a business perspective, it makes sense. If you did manage to somehow develop your own system it would not be long and you would follow suit with perk. You would want your customers using the system the way it was intended and not circumventing the app to make tons of fast cash without seeing what your ads are peddling.   That being said...when your app is up and running, shoot me a message. I have 16 phones and daddy needs a new Xbox One!"

Instead, if you could attract customers who needed CPU cycles (as Unoceros was attempting) this type of service might grow legs. The question then becomes how much is a CPU cycle worth and who is in the market to pay for them?  Solve that set of challenges and a lot of people here are going to be pretty happy with you."

And do you have the solution for how you deal with consistent growth even during  periods where advertising traditionally dips?  How do you plan to program around the fact that you will build a large membership seeking Christmas money who are not going to simply disappear in January when advertising buys aka your income is slashed to half of what it was in December?

I'm guessing lightning mode just speeds up the problem because lightning mode makes more calls so it naturally junks up faster.  I can hook up Pop Quiz iOS up to instruments and see if I'm right about all of this later by searching for memory leaks and zombies if there are a couple of people who want it.

It turns out that while there are no memory leaks, the applications just slowly bloats up eating RAM which means either the Jutera isn't using ARC or they aren't using it correctly. What I mean by this is that they aren't releasing everything completely after they're done. This isn't a problem for normal people because the memory eating happens slowly, but after about an hour the app had entirely saturated the available RAM on my iPhone 5.  Here is the graph of the start up  Notice that after only 1 minute 40 seconds and one quiz the app used 1GB of RAM which isn't released while more is piled on top."

None of the Dollar Generals around here carry the Fuels for whatever reason, but I saw plenty of people mention finding them there last month.  Best Buy is supposed to price match if there is a store selling the same product in the nearby area (I can't remember the exact range, but think like 10-15 miles), however, from what I've heard, it can be quite a pain to get price matches, especially price matches with Family Dollar.  Family Dollar is apparently not in their computer system and many of their employees do not know the process of how to manually key in a price match.  I should note, this info about Best Buy is all second-hand from what I've read on here and on /r/beermoney.  I've never personally tried to price match there."

perktv,3d75ni,JustFenix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you!  Any idea on your rough points per hour on the app? Also I found some threads of people saying running more than 1 or 2 devices on quiz has gotten them banned, but everyone seems to be doing 5 devices per app. Is it actually unsafe to run more than 1 or 2 devices on PPQ?"

perktv,3d7kiz,LazyBrownDog45,4,Tue Jul 14 03:42:11 2015 UTC,Easiest way to find out would be to run it and note down how many points you have earned.  How much other people will make is irrelevant to you since most people have different setups.

perktv,3d7jyy,youvegotmalegt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:56:58 2015 UTC,That one looks sweet.  Not sure we need 3d for our football bar-b-ques (and maybe a few building movie nights) but it does look like most recommendations lean towards Epsons.  I think that screen is larger than any of our interior walls but I do like the way you think : )

perktv,3d6dna,Maderero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:41:06 2015 UTC,Im just curious what kind of phones your running and the surrounding area because i cant imagine any phones that most of us are using for perk are getting hot at all unless you live in the desert without AC or you have them in a box without any airflow.
