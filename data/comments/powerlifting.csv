powerlifting,3e437g,johnnyjayd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"Do you you put your main, original equation in that blank you left in the mround function?  I use some other, slightly complicated version to round up to the higher 5.  Can't think of it off the top of my head though."
powerlifting,3e437g,2_Suns,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, mround will just round to the nearest multiple of whatever equation and multiplier you choose  So =mround(350 * .975,5) would equal 341.25 and give you an output of 340 in the cell  If you used =ceiling(350 * .975,5) it would output 345 in the cell. (Round up)  Likewise =floor(350 * .975,5) would round down to 340.  You can input other multipliers if you want, 2.5, 5, and maybe 10 are probably the only useful ones though."
powerlifting,3e437g,2_Suns,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:49:56 2015 UTC,"For the first suggestion, I had that initially using ceiling rounding to the nearest 2.5 lb, but I prefer to round myself because if the value is something like 149, then I'd much rather do 150 than 145 or 147.5. For the second suggestion, I assumed the TM to be a 3RM (93% of 1RM) so I made the TM to be multiplied by (1/0.93), which is 1.0753. I know I could've have Wendler's formula, (weightreps0.033+weight) but I feel that it overestimates the value."
powerlifting,3e437g,pricks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"I think it overestimates as well, I've been using .03 instead of .0333 which makes a small but noticeable difference, so =floor((W * r * .03)+w,5)  It makes for a pretty realistic 1rm estimation  Good sheet overall though"

powerlifting,3e3eps,OmnipotentStudent,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"I find TNG easier because the bounce at the bottom helps, but I feel like I get sloppier with higher reps as I don't have time to reset my form and get a proper feel for it.  I used to just train JUST TNG until about 6 months ago (silly me), where I found my sticking point was getting it off the ground. It has definitely helped a lot and also helped to increase my 1RM and break out of my plateau."

powerlifting,3e3ped,rep_it_out,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:30 2015 UTC,I use a sumo velocity and I get around 25lbs out of it. My best raw pull is 563lbs (BW: 193ish lbs) and best single ply is 589lbs (BW: 182lbs)  Edit: Suit was not very tight. I wore a 38 but I probably could of fit into a 36.

powerlifting,3e3ped,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:22 2015 UTC,Velocity is great. With a tight fitting sumo suit 80 lbs isn't out of the question off the bat.  Perfect your technique in hella tight gear and 100+ will be there. Regular fit gear should still yield 40lbs or so.  Conventional won't give you shit except the worst pain of your life  The hard core suit from inzer is good but won't give carryover like the velocity
powerlifting,3e3ped,AdmiralVonBroheim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"Velocity, hands down.   My ass struggles with it, but a decent fitting one has yielded me about 25kgs so far (Raw ~350kg, Velocity ~375kg on a perfect training day)."

I mean, they've been on my squat day list of exercises for at least 3 months and I literally haven't done them once because I run out of time and/or motivation every workout... Am I gimping myself at all?  Also, any particular negatives to turning feet out heaps for low bar? Have chronic hip issues and decided to try duck footing it today (rather than just a slight turn out) and felt way freer and hit depth properly for the first time in ages. But was struggling to sit back as much as normal because my balance was worse. Idk. I guess I just assume that I've made myself worse somehow."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,4,Tue Jul 21 10:14:35 2015 UTC,"Take a look at all of the elite level powerlifters' calves...you'll find that generally, they are pretty small. That's because the calf muscles are minimally utilized across the big 3 lifts. The main reason is stabilization, but even then if you have proper posture and set up position the stabilization is controlled/centered on the core/hips.  In regards to your foot/hips position, it's whatever is comfortable. As with all thing in powerlifting, adjustments take time to get used to. However, there is an optimal position for everyone, and usually if you have to change your form due to lack of mobility, you should probably focus on getting that area more mobile so you can get your body into it's optimal position as that is often times also the safest position. Hope that helps! Goo luck!"

powerlifting,3e1ywt,cuntpuncher_69,9,Tue Jul 21 10:40:33 2015 UTC,why no start with calves or superset them in with something else? they don't take a whole ton of energy and won't ruin your leg curl or anything like that.   or you could even do them on upperbody day with another muscle group incase you're worried about it ruining your sets for legs.
powerlifting,3e1ywt,greenalleycat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:42:57 2015 UTC,"I have no good reason for not doing them, other than the fact that I don't have a good slot to fit them in currently (homegym so it's a bit more effort than a calf machinr) and therefore I cut them first when I run overtime or whatever"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,2_Suns,3,Tue Jul 21 10:49:22 2015 UTC,"I do my calves as a superset with my squats most days.

powerlifting,3e1ywt,Nandrolixx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:20 2015 UTC,Calves are genetic man just stick with your main lifts and everything should become proportional. Also the most important aspect of lifting low bar is to make sure that the bar aligns with the center of your feet at the bottom of your squat. Angles are the most important component of the low bar squat. I personally deloaded my weight and took a month to learn proper form. It only took like a month and I was smashing PR's damn near everytime I hit the gym.

powerlifting,3e1ywt,brb_im_bulkin,3,Tue Jul 21 12:41:40 2015 UTC,Yup. I train my back basically 4 days a week.

powerlifting,3e1ywt,theNightblade,3,Tue Jul 21 14:37:33 2015 UTC,4-5 days a week depending on how much I'm in the gym.

powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,6,Tue Jul 21 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"Your coach is on the right path. The reason it is more taxing is because more effort and energy is required to stop the weight in the middle of any given range of motion rather than bottoming out. It puts WAY more emphasis on your form, control and overall strength. We coach our people to just below parallel. It is always the same response for people in your boat, ""Holy crap...that was way harder..."" ha! SO! How do you deal?  Get your core in order. Abs for days!! All of your stabilizers for all hinges will need to get stronger and that just takes time! Keep at it, you'll be better for it!!!"

powerlifting,3e1ywt,Itlan,3,Tue Jul 21 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"Let's talk squats and deadlifts:  So my issue currently with squatting is my shoulder and elbows. I'm wondering if its possible I'm internally rotating my shoulder (idk how the fuck that's even possible) to remain tight and it's causing impingement? I'm starting to creak like a fucking Titanic, I'm just hoping I don't sink soon. Should I widen my grip to take stress off my elbows and shoulders, especially when not hitting maximal weights?  As for the deadlift, I was watching a video with Omar Surfclam and Silent Mike discussing sumo foot placement and Mike stated you'll want to turn your feet out unless you're super mobile and can go completely forward. This confused the ever living shit out of me. Did he mean straight forward as in pointing completely outward like Dan Green? Or forward like a conventional deadlift, cause that don't make no god damn sense!   Also on the sumo, let's talk knees. Spreading the knees as much as possible is advantageous... always? I've brought my foot position in a little bit (thanks Ed Coan) and it's like my knees are so far beyond my feet it looks a little ridiculous."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,TheAesir,4,Tue Jul 21 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"The more your toes are pointed forward, the easier your going to find getting the weight off the floor. The closer they are to parallel with the bar, the easier it'll be at lockout."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,Itlan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh, so pointed 45 would be an even split between the two. I may try pointing forward, as lockout is never an issue for me, and I have rather good mobility."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"With your squat, shoulder and elbow tension are direct reflections of mobility. I had similar issues when I wanted to bring my grip closer on the bar. My elbows started getting some aches. I worked on elbow, shoulder, pec and lat mobility and in a few weeks I ready noticed that not only was it easier to get under the bar with my close grip but also the discomfort was gone. I do regular mobility eorj to maintain, although not nearly as much as I needed to go get there.  Without a video it's difficult to say why your knees would be SO far back. It sound like your shoulders are too far forward. The bar shoulder be making sweet sweet love to your legs all the way up!! Good luck!!"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,Itlan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do band pull aparts and shoulder dislocations regularly to try to keep my rotator cuff healthy but I'm beginning to think that's not the issue. The lat seems to be the most likely cause, although a tight pec could be the problem as well.  What do you recommend for elbow health specifically?  And it's not that my knees are BACK necessarily, just spread OUTWARD. Like I said, I moved my feet a bit in because of what Coan stated, so now when I spread my knees they shoot beyond my feet."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"Pull aparts aren't necessarily a mobility movement. The shoulder is a crossroads of ligaments, muscles, and tendons. The big player in mobility is the pec, specifically where it ties into the shoulder, technically the humerus. Roll that area real good for about 2 minutes total. You'll look weird rolling a ball against your chest on a wall, but it's fantastic. There are a few of egg really good mobility movements you can do to loosen that entire area. As for the elbow, firearms are usually the culprits! Forearm stretches for days!!  And still would need a video to be able to five you any kind of constructive criticism for the DL!"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,mizdachubz,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"Switched over to low bar about one and a half months ago. I'm still trying to figure out my stance. I used to have a narrow stance and wear lifted oly shoes for high bar. Now I seem to have a lot wider stance with flat shoes. My issue now is that I am getting some pain in the knees. My feet are placed a little outside of my shoulder width, my feet are only pointed about 15-20 degrees outward. Do I need to point my toes out more? I feel like my sets feel fine for the most part, up until I get to 80%, then my knees want to start caving in. Also, why does low bar feel so much harder than high bar :("
powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it is going to be pretty hard to say what would be caussing knee pain without seeing video. However from the description it seems like your knee pain is due to tension. Take some time, without the bar, and just do air squats. When you hit the spot that gives you the issue, try to find a groove/path that decreases or eliminates the pain. Often times knees caving in is an indicator of weak hips and glutes. A good way to work with this is to not squat with a weight if it makes your knees cave and don't move up in weight until you can squat thrighter weights with solid knees first....."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,mizdachubz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that makes a lot of sense. My hips are kind of weak. When I squat, I keep forgetting to drive with my hips after my ""bounce"" out of the bottom. I always have to rely on my training partners to yell ""hips!"""
powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,3,Tue Jul 21 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"Well there ya go, also, bottoming out like that puts unnecessary stress on your knees, you'll be better able to find any issues if you squat to parallel instead on bottoming out!

Then do a few sets with two legs at a time, just going for ultra-high reps and try to get as much time under tension as possible.

Unrack the bar, do your set of squats, then before racking it I do amrap calf raises at whatever weight is on my back.  So as you are warming up/working up to your top sets you can get a ton of calf raises in   Obviously this might not work great when you get up to crazy high weights, but my max squat is only 405 right now and I can calf raise that for 8-10reps.

I spent a lot of time working through width and foot angle to find the best for me, but the real killer was determining the right volume. I still have some damage in there (torn meniscus, lots of cartilage missing, etc) so volume may not be a concern for you. Play around with light to medium weight to find the right setup for you."

I still have days where I can't seem to get my stance right.  I don't know if it's ever going to not be an issue but it's hasn't deterred me yet."

I know for sure weakness and muscle imbalance is an issue (it's pretty visible) but I'm only seven months post op and my therapist did mention it would probably take a year to get the muscle back.  I have been squatting high bar ever since I got cleared to squat and I don't really intend to push the weight this year. My knee basically tells me how much I'm squatting each day.

powerlifting,3e1ywt,Blunderhooks2012,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"How long do you rest between sets?  Rippetoe says rest as long as needed even if it's 5, 6, ten minutes or whatever. I belatedly realized that this is terrible advice because you never develop any work capacity that way. You also end up spending a really long time in the gym relative to the amount of work you actually do! Lift for 20 seconds and then rest for six mins ... Makes no sense,  So now I'm doing 3 mins for squats and deads, two mins for bench and 90 seconds for press. Should I try to reduce those further?  Related: do any of you use density as a training variable? eg instead of changing reps, sets or weight, keep everything the same but next time reduce the rest times."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,algirnavi451,12,Tue Jul 21 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"I use intensity as a way to judge, Usually rest for 2-3 minutes below 90%, then I up that to 4, maybe 5 dependent on how I feel. Accessory work is usually 90 seconds"

powerlifting,3e1ywt,JollyGreenJeff,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"Both comments are spot on. You def want to be focusing on work capacity, and these pause intervals are pretty good. However, if you're looking to increase overall work capacity I would try the following: if your work sets are anything below 70%, try to making your rest periods closer to the short side, 60 secs-2 minutes. Really good for you in the long run. 70% - 85% try 2-4 mins and anything above that I would say 3-5 mins for sure!"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,algirnavi451,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"Set it at 2 minutes, or 90 seconds, if you're tired and hitting close to 5RM, then just take an additional minute or more. All the programs and coaches dont really have a set rest time, at least that I read and follow, it should be enough to let you rest, but not too much so that you have to warm up again (more than 5-6 minutes usually)"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,theNightblade,3,Tue Jul 21 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Use a timer.   Set it for 3 minutes between your squat/dl sets.  If it feels too short, reduce the interval.  If it's not enough, work hard and keep at it until 3 minutes is too long.  Great way to increase work capacity is to do more work in a shorter time frame.  I don't like fucking around sitting or standing between sets too long since I usually have 90ish minutes to get all of my work done.  And I want to do more work, so instead of staying longer I try to do more work in the time given."

Of your training calls for singles before any kind of down sets, then do a paused single, great practice. Of you don't use singles and only do work up to prescribed weight then go ahead and use the pause reps on the lighter end to promote memorizing the motor pattern. Either way works, however, if you incorporate the pause you should make sure your program is set up with the pause as a factor as it tends to have a decently significant effect on your body in regards to overall stress which could mess with the intended goals/progression of a non-paused program."

powerlifting,3e1ywt,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"Here  is the latest iteration of my ever evolving TM based programming.  I am adding bench volume in, in a way that I can actually manage (can't handle weekly increases in volume/intensity but can manage 2 week blocks). This also allows me to build reps in a manageable way.  The squatting is all submaximal, all low enough that I can hit clean reps and keep adding weight.  This might get modified later but it is working for now.  Deadlift is what it is, I hate them, they hate me. I need grip work more than anything else so the lower intensity and static holds should help that.  accessory work alternates weeks because I'm lazy as fuck and hate it and am already in the gym too long to be doing all of this shit every day.  Why am I being an idiot, what am I missing, etc"
powerlifting,3e1ywt,flannel_smoothie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:25 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind this too much though you are still lowballing squat a bit too much. Why not try AMRAPing that a bit on your Monday session as well? It'll just let you push that work capacity a little further.
powerlifting,3e1ywt,brb_im_bulkin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that I'm going with slightly too low intensity on squat. I should have mentioned that those increases aren't final, I've been moving the working weights up by feel.   So we'll see how that goes. The 5x5 kills me right now, I might add an AMRAP on Friday and see what happens."
powerlifting,3e1ywt,flannel_smoothie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"My two cents:  Have you ever considered a 4 day per week TM template? Doing so allowed me to get extra benching and pulling volume in, which has done wonders to my progress. I find that each session is a little shorter than a typical TM volume or intensity day, and I feel less drained. I personally think switching over to a 4 day/week template makes handling more volume more manageable."

powerlifting,3e073v,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,33,Tue Jul 21 19:46:58 2015 UTC,"The fuck does he keep say ""torsion"" for?   ""Create torsion, create torsion"" The fuck is he talking about?  Also, ""definitely not a hamstring thing"". One of the main functions of the hamstring is the antagonistic action of the thing he's saying people lack, hip flexion. Hamstrings are involved in hip extension! How is it they wouldn't contribute to lack of hip flexion.  Then there's ""as you get stronger, you lose mobility"". Google bodybuilders doing the splits...  EDIT: He says ""unimpinge (not a word) the hip"" at some point. Hip impingement is a specific thing, and turning the thigh does nothing remedy impingement.  EDIT 2: Near the end he literally says maintain the hip in an isometric position, which means nothing on its own, but if he's referring to isometric exercise then he's a bigger moron because an isomeric exercise is a STATIC exercise, ie. has no range of motion.  EDIT 3: For anyone wondering this is torsion. What ol doc here might be referring to is adduction   Edit 4: some backlash after a while. Kelly may be a very effective trainer, but when you make a video where you explain things and then explain them wrong it looks really really bad."
powerlifting,3e073v,bootselectric,6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"I thought by the hip flextion thing he was reffering to a lot of people having APT which forces their pelvis into not the best position which then in turn makes it hard to get your knee to the chest with ease.  And I dont think it was a strict: ""if you get stronger your mobility goes down"" I think it's more that a lot of people dont train for mobility so as they get stronger their mobility will never increase and if they gain a lot of muscle they will need different, usually smaller, ranges of motion which will result in mobility decreasing since it's no longer needed."
powerlifting,3e073v,ghoulmaster,8,Tue Jul 21 03:13:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, but he keeps saying they lack flexion, flexion tilts the hip forward, thus APT. So if you lack flexion, it would be fair to consider that the extensors are the culprit. They may not be the culprit, maybe you have one of those (speaking in a grave and diagnostic voice) ""junky hips"" he mentions, but still I wouldn't rule it out.  Even with APT you can get your knee to your chest. The test for APT isn't whether your knee can touch your chest, it's whether when you try to touch your chest with one leg, does the other leg start to lift (in a lying position). This would be irrelevant in a 2 legged exercise.  So, too much flexion would result in lordosis, while too much extension would result in kyphosis (what he was describing where your back rounds into an 'n' shape).  An he was pretty clear that getting stronger == less ROM. You're argument is definitely right, but that's not what he said."

It was Mark Bell who kept calling him doctor. /u/bootselectric you referred to him as a charlatan. So you're saying that a doctor of physical therapy, who has gone through 3-4 years of graduate study, is licensed, who is currently practicing physical therapy, is a fraud? Not sure what you're getting at here.     Then there's ""as you get stronger, you lose mobility"".   I think he meant in general. A lot of people ignore mobility work as they get stronger so they tend to get stiffer. Yes, you can google bodybuilders doing splits and I guarantee you that they spend time doing mobility work on top of their regular training. This proves nothing.   EDIT: He says ""unimpinge (not a word) the hip"" at some point. Hip impingement is a specific thing, and turning the thigh does nothing remedy impingement.   Adding in adduction and external rotation doesn't necessarily remedy lack of flexion, but gets around it. It's kinda like using squat shoes to make up for lack of ankle flexion. You're not really fixing anything, but just finding a way around it. You're right, hip impingement is a very specific condition (see femoroacetabular impingement), but he uses impingement as a broader term.   EDIT 2: Near the end he literally says maintain the hip in an isometric position, which means nothing on its own, but if he's referring to isometric exercise then he's a bigger moron because an isomeric exercise is a STATIC exercise, ie. has no range of motion.   He pretty much means holding the hip at a constant frontal plane angle. Yeah he said it a little weirdly, but it's not necessarily wrong.   EDIT 3: For anyone wondering this is torsion. What ol doc here might be referring to is adduction   Probably means a combination of ABduction (not ADduction) and external rotation.  And torsion is just a way for him to colloquialize external rotation. Would you argue that firing your glutes and having your hips externally rotated during the deadlift is wrong?  It really seems to me that a lot of people on this subreddit tend to jump on tiny little errors in Starrett's speech and blow it up to say everything he does is wrong, just because of his association with Crossfit."

Edit: look, he may be a very effective coach and being an effective coach does not require that you know absolutely everything about anatomy. But when you start to move into territory where you overcomplicate things and that overcomplication is wrong then you start to lose credibility. I ahd the benefit of working with some national level/professional trainers for my sport as a teenager. They were very good and never once did they talk about specific muscle insertions or overcomplicate their explanations. Why? Because you don't need to and like I said, when you're wrong and using big fancy words it makes you look even worse."

powerlifting,3dyopt,Gary_Oldman_AMA,9,Tue Jul 21 14:31:38 2015 UTC,"So a few questions: INOL only applies to a single movement?  Does that mean that we can't really use INOL if, say, we are back squatting and front squatting in the same session?  Or are those close enough movements where front squat volume can be included?  If so, do we calculate INOL of front squatting as a percentage of back squat or as a percentage of it's own 1RM?  In other words, if I am front squatting as a secondary movement because it brings up a weak point and it is easier for me to recover from, do I calculate INOL based on percentage of my back squat to account for the fact that it is less taxing and easier to recover from or do I over inflate INOL by basing my calculation of front squats off of my front squat 1RM?  Or is this simply impossible because INOL ignores any cumulative fatigue from two different yet similar movements?  I'm only asking because not all lifts/variations are equally fatiguing and, especially when a particular accessory or movement has been lagging for a long time, doing a lot of volume at a higher percentage of your max than you would a main lift may not be as fatiguing as it looks on paper.  For me a weekly INOL of 3 for back squats might leave me feeling pretty wrecked whereas going up to 3 on front squats might not be all that bad because I haven't done a lot of front squatting in the past and the disparity between my front squat and back squat is just abnormally high.  I'm probably just overthinking it, though."
powerlifting,3dyopt,BenchPolkov,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think if you have accurate 1RMs for each lift variation you could probably come out with a normalised INOL for a type of lift it might become too complicated if you use too many variations. I can do it for my squats because I just use a straight or cambered bar for normal or paused squats and I actually find paused squats reasonably easy and more of a form reinforcer than anything, but with bench I probably use 6 different variations in my programming and they're all based off my competition bench in intensity and not specific 1RMs for each variation so normalising an INOL for bench would probably become too complicated for me to bother with."

powerlifting,3dyopt,Chadlynx,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Jamie Lewis put it pretty aggressively.   The other phenomenon detailed frequently by the guys at SYWH is that of the Srs Bros— people who take themselves and the shit they do way too seriously. Interestingly, people mistake me for one of them on occasion due to my emphatic writing style. I really don’t take lifting all that seriously— it’s something I do because I enjoy it, rather than because I think it’s some noble cause. I couldn’t possibly give a shit less if people around me lift. I assume they’d do it if they wanted to and if they don’t, it’s because they dislike it. There are a great many people on the internet who take themselves and strength sports incredibly seriously while 1) being generally uneducated and weak, and 2) appearing to enjoy the discussion of lifting far more than lifting itself. Don’t be one of those guys— you suck the fun out of lifting for yourself and others. Endless discussions about which training protocol are best are pointless (that much should be readily apparent) and boring, and it’s effort that would be far better spent in the gym. Don’t waste your enthusiasm pounding out vociferous missives about who’s on gear and who’s natty, or who’s doing what and who is a jackass, and just fucking lift. That’s the only way you’re going to get stronger, and really the only way to prove any point you might make in a discussion about lifting, anyway. Never forget that lifting is really just an enjoyable pastime, at the end of the day, and not a job. Oh, and be sure to tell the Srs bros to go fuck themselves at every opportunity— the question “Do you even lift, bro?” should be rhetorical when you address them. I assure you that they do not."

Normally my deadlift INOL would probably be higher than squats because I've generally always worked at higher intensities for that lift (possibly why the injury, and possibly why my squat has always lagged but that's definitely changing now). And then in terms of bench I actually run a significantly inflated training max (10-15kg over my true max at least) and use VERY high volume (5-6 sessions a week, sometimes more, and regularly going over 200 lifts per week) so my REAL bench INOL would probably kill most people but its been working pretty well for me for a few years now.

powerlifting,3dyopt,hamburgertrained,4,Mon Jul 20 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"This might be a little long winded, but I have a question about how to apply this for different intensities, and routines based on fatigue and frequency.  I used this to compare two programs, at opposite ends of the spectrum, so with a previous Sheiko week I get an INOL of 3.18 for the week.  Now with Bulgarian Method, I get an INOL of 2 for the week.  However because on Sheiko I am lifting only two days of the week, and the average intensity is much lower, I feel great on it, when I'm doing Bulgarian, the INOL is lower, but, I feel terrible on it due to the fatigue management (5 days per week, so 24 hours between each session, versus 4 days), noticeably the Bulgarian approach is too much for me despite a lower INOL compared to Sheiko.  So, how can you use this tool to compare completely different programs with different frequency and average intensity, or is it not applicable for this purpose?  Thanks  (and a side note, I'm supposing for more advanced lifters their max INOL number is likely to get lower, because despite the same % of 1RM, the fatigue produced is higher with greater weights, although you could argue their recovery/work capacity is higher)."
powerlifting,3dyopt,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:52 2015 UTC,"This is going to be the least scientific response ever. Here is how you differentiate: You are getting more work done on one program (lower frequency) because you feel better with the extra rest days. You are doing less work with a higher frequency, thus cutting out 1.18 INOLS of total work a week. Over the course of a year, if you continue with the higher frequency of training, you have cut down the amount of actual intense training you perform by a little over 1/3. The whole reason for doing higher frequencies is to increase the amount of volume and intensity you can handle in a week. I think a lot of lifter jump into higher frequency training too soon because that's kinda the trendy thing going on right now. You should add in another training day until you NEED to. Not just because you WANT to.  From personal experience, I have been training for about 16 years. 10 for powerlifting. I just starting using a higher frequency program a little over a year ago. I think everything up until that point was GPP to be able to handle the workload now. If I tried to do this any sooner, I probably would have just died. There is no fucking way I could have been conditioned enough to handle it.  My training right now is fucking insane. I can't believe I am capable of getting through it ok but I am really pushing the limits here. If 15, 20, or even 25 year old me tried to do this, I'd probably be doing crossfit now instead."
powerlifting,3dyopt,DrColossus1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  That makes sense, I think it comes down to measuring INOL over weekly, versus a daily basis, clearly with Sheiko the daily INOL is lower, and the time for recovery kind of drops down your weeky INOL number with rest.  I totally agree, it's become a trend/fad, I wanted to try it out because Greg Nuckols in an interview stated he made some impressive gains after Sheiko by doing Bulgarian training, but for me it does not work. Today after an extra days rest, I couldn't even hit a previous PR so the experiment is over before I get hurt.  Hah, my quads felt like I had been doing Crossfit for a few weeks.  It's certainly amazing how adaptable the human body is over time. It seems more advanced athletes can tolerate more volume, and intensity, but confusingly for some larger athletes they actually need less because of the sheer amount of work they're doing in one session."
powerlifting,3dyopt,hamburgertrained,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"I couldn't really follow the part where he talks about how to total up sets of different intensities.  Like, a 5x5 @ 80% would come out to (25/20) 1.25, but if you have, instead, 2x5@ 75% (.4) and 3x2 @95% (1.5), would you weighted-average them together (1.06, I think)? Or how else do you assess how it all fits together into a program?  I'm just making up numbers obviously, you can plug in whatever."
powerlifting,3dyopt,JosephusBroz,5,Mon Jul 20 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"You just add them together. So, if your program called for  Day 1= Bench Press- 5x5 @80%=INOL=1.25 Day 2=Bench Press- 2x5 @75% (.4) and 3x2 @95% (1.2)= 1.6 for the session Then your INOL for that whole week is 2.85  Think of it this way too. A single set of 5x5 @80% is only a .25 INOL while a single set of 3x2 @95% is .4. Thats a very big difference in terms of intensity.   It fits into the program by giving you standardized numbers to follow for loading and how to differentiate between different phases of training."
powerlifting,3dyopt,hamburgertrained,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"If I may follow up. When you mention the INOL for the whole week, is it the sum of all lifts done during that week, or each individual lift. To use your example above, a lifter has a 2.85 INOL for the whole week from benching. Would I add squat and deadlift to these numbers too?"
powerlifting,3dyopt,JosephusBroz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"You can add them all together if that is easier for you to track it.

powerlifting,3dyopt,hamburgertrained,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:18 2015 UTC,How about MINOL-PS(mean intensity number of lifts per set).  2x5@80%=.5INOL/2=.25MINOL-PS 5x2@80%=.5INOL/5=.1MINOL-PS The video explains this a little I think but doesn't tell you how to use it. Maybe track it for a while and see what MINOL-PS is best for each phase of your program. Could take awhile to get enough relevant data. I would tend to think a low MINOL-PS would be good for volume blocks and higher for intensity phases. E.G. Week 1 MINOL-PS=.25 Week 5 MINOL-PS=.6  Hell I don't know. This doesn't even tell you how to calculate INOL if your at the end of a block and are doubling or tripling your old max which is something my squat routine has me do.

I now squat over 100kg 5x5,deadlift 130 kg 1x5 and bench 62,5kg 5x5 and 47.5 kg 10x10. Because i never feel sore afterwards, I do a lot of different extra exercises. I'm at the gym for 2 to 3 hours 3 to 4 times a week.   Am I not sore because I'm not even close to a heavy weight or am I just fortunate? I've never been able to test my 1rm for any of my lifts because it's too dangerous alone and I don't really know anyone at my gym."

powerlifting,3e0lxx,Mikegengsta,26,Tue Jul 21 06:40:09 2015 UTC,from my own personal experience the biggest difference maker for how heavy a weight feels to me is how tight I get my upper back. when it is as tight as I can possibly get it pretty much any weight (even like 90-95%) still feels light when unracking/setting up. on those days when I just cant get my upper back locked in everything feels much heavier than it should.
powerlifting,3e0lxx,justagameboy,8,Tue Jul 21 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, that and how well I'm bracing. I warm up beltless pretty close to my work sets on days like this, so I get a confidence boost when I put the belt on and unracking doesn't feel as bad."

I've got a mate who just switched from high bar (185kg max) to low bar, and he was complaining how much heavier it feels even at 175kg. It's just how it goes, gotta get your head in the game as much or more so than your body."

powerlifting,3e0lxx,the0rthopaedicsurgeo,4,Tue Jul 21 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"Low bar, even though I can squat more with it, feels heavier because it takes a lot more back tightness to keep the bar in place.

powerlifting,3e0lxx,14xjake,5,Tue Jul 21 02:09:27 2015 UTC,I always fire myself up mentally before anything over 75% and if I'm mentally in it it comes off the rack so easy and moves so fast.

I literally just hit it for one set of 8 reps ~10 days ago and that was from linear progression from ~330 x 8 and adding 5 lbs per workout on a squatting 2x/wk routine.

powerlifting,3e0lxx,markers920,4,Tue Jul 21 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Squat warm ups feel quite heavy for me too. I think for me it's because I pump myself up and get the adrenaline going for the heavy sets.

powerlifting,3dzgay,markers920,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be surprised about how well good mornings work for upper back stability.  You have to hold the bar extremely tightly with your upper back, while preventing your spine from rounding in a very compromised position.  It's not a very good ""pulling"" exercise (it's not a pull exercise at all) but it's very practical back work for squatting.  I think a lot of people abandoned good mornings because the movement itself isn't very applicable to the squat - there's minimal flexion at the knee and the movement resembles a squat that you're trying to avoid.  However, the stability required in the entirety of the torso during a good morning is VERY applicable to the squat and deadlift.  As a stand-alone builder for the squat, the good morning is very lacking, but it's still an amazing movement for the entire torso."
powerlifting,3dzgay,foxlongj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:26 2015 UTC,you could do round t-spine mornings. I like to do them seated. You use a lot less weight and you basically just do the good morning and then round your upper back forward then arch it back to wear it's supposed to be  Here's the best example I could find. Unlike the video I usually do most of a seated GM before I round. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgpSj33K7bY

powerlifting,3dxh69,Mattman-95,12,Mon Jul 20 18:02:58 2015 UTC,Requires better positioning and stability. I've seen people make pause squats that were just fucking awful. Likely not going to happen with a front squat. You'll lose the bar first. This will help keep loads recoverable.

Yes you can squat there.

I was doing 3x8 for Tier 2 and taking one rep off each week, finishing with 3x5 on the 4th week. I'm thinking that this cycle, since I'll be cutting, I'm going to start the Tier 2 work at 3x5 and work down to 3x2 by the end. This keeps intensity fairly high but volume somewhat low, which I think will help my recovery. I think I'll still keep the Tier 3 work in the 10-15 rep range with a lot of BB and prehab focus.   Does that make sense?"
powerlifting,3dxh69,dogsalt,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Makes sense to me. But keep in mind that with the massive decrease in T2 volume the majority of your T2 work should be above 75% of your training max. And with that heavier average of T2 work just know it stands to impact your performance in the T1. I'd likely only keep something like that around for 3-4 weeks tops. Especially under the conditions of a cut.
powerlifting,3dxh69,gzcl,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:29 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'll see how recovery is affected. Both my lower body T1s are squat (low bar, SSB), and I usually recover well there, so my thinking is that without primary deadlift work I should be somewhat OK to recover. Also keeping calories steady on off days and limiting the conditioning work.   Thanks a ton."

Is it a habit? Or pecs injured?  When I was young, I listened to “wise” people who said that grip should be maximally wide – 81 cm. The range is shorter and to press heavier is easier like that. But over time, I understood that this does not work for me. My arms are long, and in the bottom position I was not able to engage muscles of the back. As a result I constantly had injuries of shoulders and pecs. But my close grip bench press has always been good. At 17 years of age, I benched 200 kg with a close grip, but with glutes off the bench. I decided not to think too much about this, and I switched to close grip. After that I had no injuries, no pain and strength has been increasing slowly but constantly.

Add it in after your raw sets, using the same weight you did at the top set.  You should be able to get a couple of extra reps/sets out of it.    I'd say add in a 4th benching day if you're not doing it already.  Mix in some single board press days, and use your slingshot as an over load on heavy days.  Most people's bench numbers respond to volume and the board/floor press and slingshot should help you from getting too wrecked."

powerlifting,3e0yse,TheDeathCard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"This is very similar to my situation so I can speak as to what my plan is.   I'm 5'8"" 165lbs with 370 squat, 210 comp bench (225 tng), 425 deadlift. I have super long arms that make deadlift easy and bench difficult. I played around with a wider grip for a few months but as soon as I switched back to medium grip (forearms perpendicular to floor when bar touches my chest) it felt much better. That might be personal preference, but I don't think an extremely wide grip that goes to IPF limits will help you any more than a normal grip.   My main plan of action is to gain weight. at 5'8"" I should really be closer to 185-195. Seeing as you're 5'11"", 165 is way too light. The heavier you get the bigger your chest will be and the stronger off your chest you will be.   Also, taking notes from BenchPolkov's advice, I am benching a lot more. I am running Sheiko and one of the reasons is because it has me benching or doing chest/tri work every time I'm in the gym. The frequency and variation is helping a ton.   I've never used a slingshot. I would like to have one, but it alone will not solve any problems that can't be addressed in another way. At least at our level.

You may receive far more detailed answers, but I would recommend starting out by calculating you TDEE (http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm) so that you can get a good idea of how much you should be eating calories wise. Other than that, I generally follow .8-1.2g Protein/ Lb BW, and for fat and carbs I cycle depending on my goals (ie Cutting, Upping my numbers)"
powerlifting,3dz024,chadwickpark,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"Whole foods > processed junk. If you have problems with getting hungry eyes then it's best to start weighing your food because you can easily overdo it.  Fat will not make you fat. Saturated fats (yes fat(s) not fat because there are so many with different characteristics. Studdies suggest that short & medium chain fatty acids [butter & meat] are better than long chain ones [monounsaturated]...most fatty foods are a combination of severl types of fats....no need to boycot any of them) will not make you fat. A surplus of calories will. Since fat is the most calorically dense macronutrient, it is easy to overdo it.  If you are maintaining body weight, most protein recommendations will be much higher than what your body truly needs (a measly 80-120g/day). That number will rise with your deficit, assuming you are cutting weight (2.3-3.1g/Kg of LBM).  From there on, eat whatever you like."
powerlifting,3dz024,hiroshi-ma2,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"First off meat and butter have only trace amounts of short and medium chain fatty acids; the large majority is palmitate and stearate.  Secondly, monounsaturated fats have been linked with improved insulin sensitivity, better lipid profiles and increased thermogenesis in comparison with saturated fats.  I'm surprised that you didn't mention sugar."
powerlifting,3dz024,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"Secondly, monounsaturated fats have been linked with improved insulin sensitivity, better lipid profiles and increased thermogenesis in comparison with saturated fats.   Regular meal timings throughout the week will have a greater effect on insulin sensitivity (as well as blood lipid profile and postparandial thermogenesis) than consuming monounsaturated fats. Exercise alone will help, if insulin sensitivity is your main priority. Unfortunately most of those studies are sampling sedentary populations. I don’t think the people of r/powerlifting should be too concerned, unless they want to lean out. Intermittent fasting is also another fantastic tool for improving insulin sensitivity (8h eating window for men, 10h eating window for women will play a huge role).  Saturated fats are linked to increasing testosterone (although I believe monounsaturated fats will help increase it as well). Yet people still fear fatty meats. Btw, I am not recommending McDonald’s and other junk food as a great source of saturated fats, I was thinking more along the lines of pork chops, steak & even bacon.   I'm surprised that you didn't mention sugar.   Of course! This is for overall health. Although there are some people who are getting very lean with a bastardized version of IIFYM, they will consume copious amounts of fructose while still being in a caloric deficit. Most of these cases are young. I do not recommend this. But yeah…sugar is never a good idea. It sucks for us individuals suffering from a severe case of sweet-tooth.  tl;dr - Eat whole foods, don't fear fats, track your macros if you're prone to eating when you're bored and limit your sugar intake as much as you can (have limited dessert in order to maintain your sanity)"
powerlifting,3dz024,hiroshi-ma2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"There are tons of studies that demonstrate the various pro-lipogenic, inflammatory, insulin desensitizing effects of a diet high in saturated fats (presumably we're talking palmitate, stearate and myristate, if you want to get specific).  Can you offset that by doing other things right, such that you can still get very lean?  Sure, if you've got decent genetics and you're young, or you don't mind losing a little muscle/retarding your fat loss.  I still treat myself to pizza on occasion, but it is a conscious trade-off of results for a little bit of sanity.  One thing to note with sugar is that if your liver glycogen is depleted it is actually fine (to a degree) from a nutrition standpoint.  Thus, if you're in a decent sized deficit and moderately active, 100g of sugar isn't going to have the same effect it would if you were in a surplus or less active.  One interesting thing I've noticed is that the majority of notable IIFYM proponents are young guys who were lean before they started working out; they also tend to be on the smaller side, like physique competitors."
powerlifting,3dz024,CuriouslyCultured,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"100g of sugar isn't going to have the same effect it would if you were in a surplus or less active.   That is true, the buffer is usually around 90-120g depending on the individual, however your liver is not always going to be depleted. For someone who is cycling calories and doing a recomp, fat gain can potentially occur even though they will be in an overall weekly deficit. Their results won't be optimum. I didn't think the people on this sub were that interested in aesthetics so I didn't bother with the details about liver glycogen storage, hence the: reduce processed sugar. Your testosterone levels & teeth will thank you too.   IIFYM proponents are young guys who were lean before they started working out; they also tend to be on the smaller side, like physique competitors.   IIFYM is appealing to most people because of how easy it is to follow. Most people, the younger guys especially, want results asap. I also think the fact that they are small has to do with the natural limit of LBM. I mean, if you're a 5'9 guy and an extreme outlier, your upper limit @10% body fat will be roughly 175lbs. That guy will look very big in comparison to an average Joe with those statistics...but he will still get dwarfed by a 6'2 foot 260 lb powerlifter. It is all relative."

powerlifting,3dz024,TheAesir,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:47 2015 UTC,"Oh man, the link between saturated fats and adiposity is strong.  Just because they don't cause heart disease doesn't mean that they are good from a body composition standpoint.  Here's a post where I culled a few for someone else... there are plenty more out there I didn't bother to cite, check for yourself.  Fiber (soluble, particularly) is metabolized by gut bacteria to produce butyric acid, among other compounds, which directly mediate inflammation, insulin resistance and adiposity.  For starters, check out this review but honestly you should spend some time on pubmed getting caught up.  As for the carbs vs fats comment, check out Alan Aragon's evidence based recommendations article for some references in regards to carbs vs fat for lean, active people.  The recommendation to focus on fats for sedentary/overweight people is based on the assumption that they are likely to have poor insulin sensitivity along with lower levels of glycolytic enzymes and thus a carb heavy diet will tend to result in chronic hyperglycemia.  This is problematic because glucose is inflammatory and inflammation actually exacerbates insulin resistance (quite a nice feedback loop, there).  This is also a health risk as the liver will be working overtime converting that excess glucose into unhealthy VLDL particles when insulin fails to lower blood glucose.  Feel free to toss over any interesting studies you know of that you feel run counter to my arguments, I'd be happy to take a look at them."

powerlifting,3dz024,TheAesir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:25 2015 UTC,"""avoid sugar and saturated fat"" is over-generalizing how exactly, given the fact that there is a plethora of science showing saturated fat is inferior to other fat sources if your goal is to optimize body composition?  I've made a good faith gesture, it's your turn to pony up some evidence.  Do you honestly believe the RDA has any meaning at all with regards to optimizing body composition or athletic performance?  I've experimented with various amounts of fiber in my diet, and I can tell you firsthand that higher fiber intake has made a significant difference in terms body composition and strength retention while hypocaloric.  It's not even hard to get plenty of fiber, just supplement your daily diet with a big bowl of lentils or split peas."

powerlifting,3duht0,theNightblade,3,Sun Jul 19 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"On that day, at that meet, I was reintroduced to what powerlifting really is. It’s not about the judging, gear, federation, being part of the strongest team, world records, rankings and all the other stuff that became a driving force of my identity. It is sampling lifting in pursuit of personal power = POWERlifting. This is how I see it now. It’s an amazing sport that can and does have the power to change lives. It took many of years of competing and then leaving the sport completely before I fully recognized this.   I wish more people would remember this.  It's easy for me to put into perspective since I started powerlifting long after the age where a lot of people would be 'retiring'"

I'll probably change to something else soon since I've had to reset my bench a few times and my DL is getting tougher.  I haven't made any decisions on a program yet, and I'm going on a 4 week holiday soon so it seems like a waste to start a new program then bail for a month."

This is below expectations for I then switched to the Texas Method. After a few months of constant resetting I moved on to doing my own programming and have made slow steady gains since(except on bench).  If we knew your body weight and current lifts it could help.

(It was ludicrously easy but I hadn't lifted regularly since 2005, and I'm kind of injury prone, so I wanted to develop the habit and learn the form.)  I'm now at 255/150/260 5x5. Squat and deads still feel relatively doable. Bench is getting worrisome. I've given up on OHP due to impingement/possible arthritis, but looking into some other assistance work that won't fuck my shoulder."
powerlifting,3dw4as,Dreadlifts,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:19 2015 UTC,If you are having problems with bench you can switch your program for bench or possibly get 1.25lbs plates(you can buy at rogue for under $10) and only add 2.5lbs instead of 5. Stick with some kind of LP as long as possible. Your a real big guy and I tend to think your can keep these lifts moving. Don't over think this.  Please consider doing OHP or at least incline bench at least once a week. Avoiding shoulder work can make shoulder pain from bench pressing worse.
powerlifting,3dw4as,mntbrry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate it! I am going to mess around with different shoulder things and see what works without causing pain.

powerlifting,3dteaz,Itlan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm in a similar situation. After doing a shit ton of research and spending many hours trying to find the most optimal way to train in order to get strong here's what I can tell you as an intermediate lifter myself.   Keep practicing the main lift, but don't always go really high intensity, put a lot of work in to building up your muscle through accessory lifts. At some point, most of your gains will come through muscular gains and less through CNS gains. Add in some high rep work with dumbbells and other movements, such as incline bench to stimulate growth. Doing accessory work will hit different muscles than always doing the power movements and improve your under trained muscles to have a stronger base.  Frequency in the gym will also stimulate more growth. So as /u/BenchPolkov has state, definitely add in more volume to train the muscles required for the bench, but still get some practice in.   Here's what I recommend you read. Skip to the intermediate section.  I would also highly recommend Eric Helms' videos, here's a good start.  I'm just starting to apply these things myself. Technically you could increase the volume with high intensities, but recovery is a lot slower with high intensities and your joints and tendons won't like it. So the easiest way to increase it is by lowering intensity and increasing sets/reps overall to get that work in.  tl;dr: Start focusing more on muscular gains through accessories while still getting in some high intensity main lift work."

Started week at 112kg, weighed in at 7am at 104.98kg.  Squat  1st - 240kg went up easy, was a bit concerned that I might not get it to how much I cut weight. 3/3  2nd - 250kg bit of a grinder because back wasn't tight and hips rose too fast. 3/3  3rd 257.5kg absolute grinder but form stayed good, just was heavy. 3/3  Bench  1st - 145kg easy and good. 3/3  2nd - 152.5 kg Bar just went straight up off my chest instead of up & back, made it not very easy and had to grind it out but still got it. 3/3  3rd - 155kg miss. I've hit this multiple times in training so I know I have the strength. elbows flared  hard coming off my chest and lost it then, so mostly a technique issue. 0/3  Deadlift  1st - 275kg easy 3/3  2nd - 287.5kg good but was forward and moved slower than I wanted 3/3  3rd - 298kg. had to fight with coaches to get this weight they wanted 290kg but that was useless and wouldn't have given me anything except tying pr. Pushed for 298 to give me CPU total and deadlift records. Initially was 1/2 reds but was overturned by jury because idk why I got reds. 2/3   Over all was a good day. set NAPF records on all my openers and ended up with Jr 105 CPU total and deadlift records. Also had the only lift all week that was overturned by jury, which is an interesting tidbit.   Overall went 8/9 for 708kg total and 424 wilks"

He was a long armed, short torso-ed guy. Think Bob Peoples or Vince Anello.  Dan Green detailed his deadlift program in Power, I thought it was low tech enough to be worth a look. Green modified it for a more normal proportioned puller who uses sumo. Took him from a stalled 660 conventional to having pulled over 800 multiple times as a 220.  Also, this Dan Green article is the article that will keep me buying Power Mag, useful, insightful, and detailed enough to use.   Craig Terry's version.  Conv.

powerlifting,3dp6fi,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,7,Sat Jul 18 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"He's definitely an outlier with what he does, but it clearly works well for him.  Other examples, squatting low bar, wide stance, in olympic shoes.  Benching raw with a pause, sink and heave.  I'd really like to learn to do some of this, it takes a hell of a lot of practice from what I can tell.  Edit: On closer inspection I think it just looks like grip and rip, there's a lot of tension at the bottom, and the bar is fairly flexible."
powerlifting,3dp6fi,TheOmnivious,3,Sat Jul 18 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"Heaves are when you move the bar downward after the press command, illegal move in most leagues. Dan only does the sink, but they are similar movements."
powerlifting,3dp6fi,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware that's what the term meant, I thought it referred to the way he presses his body upwards with leg drive which forces the bar off his chest, most benchers don't seem to use leg drive in this method."
powerlifting,3dp6fi,TheOmnivious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, that's just a more forceful flexation of the whole body in order to get more of a stretch reflex. When you lift your head off the bench your chest depresses; when its pulled back the muscles tighten again resulting in a stretch reflex and a change of torque to help the weight off of the chest. Using additonal leg drive during this is needed in order to explosively drive the torso back into ""regular"" position, and provides the extra tightness required for sinking to be effective.  Sinking and heaving are essentially the same movement, however, heaving is illegal as you lift your head up AFTER the press command, causing the bar to move down by up to an inch, and making the lift more like a paused touch'n'go press."
powerlifting,3dp6fi,TheOmnivious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"I see, I wonder if he would use a different bench technique if he had to do longer pauses.  It's something I would play with, but since I plan to compete under more strict rules (flat feet, head on bench) it's unlikely I'll be able to use it."
powerlifting,3dp6fi,Zuldy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:31:14 2015 UTC,It actually helps for longer pauses as you don't have to remain 100% flexed during the pause.
powerlifting,3dp6fi,xbassx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"It's not so much of a sink, to quote someone I saw on YouTube, ""People just aren't used to seeing such a skilled lifter place the weight in the correct spot in such a short amount of time."""
powerlifting,3dp6fi,hakujin214,3,Sat Jul 18 22:03:18 2015 UTC,That makes sense; Its more so about lifting the head off of the bench to depress the chest and increase tension.

powerlifting,3dnnmw,statasaurus,11,Fri Jul 17 20:56:23 2015 UTC,Yeah but they are the best athletes in the world and put up crazy lifts without knowing what they are doing. If they focused on lifting for a decade they would blow away everything.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:34 2015 UTC,Yeah due to their amateur nature strength sports rarely ever get the cream of the genetic crop.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,BenchPolkov,3,Sun Jul 19 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"They don't even train to perform well in the lifts.  All of that is supplemental/accessory work to support their conditioning for their sport... and you still have dudes who are crazy strong and would put up very strong totals even by PL standards.  Here you have Larry Allen benching 705 with shitty form, a bounce off the chest and probably some assistance from his spotter.  Would never pass in a meet, but he isn't a bench specialist, either. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX-YuvQkSRE  Edit:  Here's Phillip Daniels, retired after a 15 year career in the NFL, putting up 722 at a PL meet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7miFTehlUQ"
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Gary_Oldman_AMA,2,Fri Jul 17 22:29:48 2015 UTC,With the Phillip Daniels comment I initially thought that you meant bench...

powerlifting,3dnnmw,xbassx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:45 2015 UTC,"I actually doubt that. Most of the genetic elite will more than likely end up in a professional or olympic sport though we will always get a few who slip through the net due to injuries, etc, like Blaine Sumner (American Football) and The Mountain (Basketball). Shaw was on a full college basketball scholarship before he got hooked on lifting. Sure some of the top guys have gone straight into PL, WL or SM, or come via BB'ing but I think we're actually lucky that their potential was recognised elsewhere."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,BenchPolkov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:08:45 2015 UTC,"If you look at their height and weight though, it seems like most of the overlap between athletes in football and those who excel in powerlifting exists, but in powerlifting there is an even greater trend towards specification towards the lifts.  You're telling me that the 7'0, 400 lb monsters at WSM would be overshadowed by football players if the football players just started to focus on powerlifting? Or that athletes like Fredrik Smutter would be out benched despite having the best leverages in the world for the said lifts? I doubt it.  That being said, the football players seem to be more in general extremely athletic and able to apply their strength. Spoto benching 722 with his leverages and having Larry Allen bench 700 with his leverages are two very different situations; it makes me consider what you said seriously since Spoto is hyper specified into the bench press (former basketball player?) whereas Allen was an all around athlete. The question at that point becomes, ""Would Allen be able to add 22 lbs to his bench, or is he at his maximum potential regardless of training type there?""  Watching people like Bakkelund, CYC, Spoto, Smutter, Magnusson, Hall, Kokylaev, etc. make me doubt that they could ever be beaten.   Also its important to mention that in countries like Iceland and Russia, strength sports are essentially as popular ""per capita"" as sports like football and baseball are in the United States. Apparently in Iceland there's like specific training camps for children for strength training and they are very popular. Think of how the Chinese absolute dominate Olympic weightlifting in the sub 85kg classes.   Now of course you could make the argument that because the population in those countries (save China) is lower, that having the 1 in 300 million athlete would occur in the US, but then why not consider the 1 in 7 billion athlete? Americans are generally smaller than people from Finland, Denmark, Sweden, etc. so via standard deviation..."

Sure, the athlete themself may not be doing that, but being there sure as fuck associates themselves with it.   It just looks bad.   And you can do other competitions as long as you have express consent from the IPF."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,140kgPowerSmith,11,Fri Jul 17 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Its not that it looks bad, its that the IPF is trying to present itself as a true international federation for IOC recogntion.  Part of that is the IOC requires that the sport be represented by a unified worldwide federation that has control over its athletes. Disallowing competition in other federations is part of that attempt to control competition and present itself as the one true world federation.   The lack of unity in powerlifting will be one of the reasons that the IOC will continue to be ""very interested"" but ""regretfully decline"" the application of the IPF."

powerlifting,3dnnmw,GilesGorey,3,Fri Jul 17 21:42:33 2015 UTC,RPS and other feds put on great meets.  The only significant thing the IPF offers that other feds don't is true international competition with a chance to represent one's country in team competition.  IOC recognition (even without inclusion in the Olympic games) is a nice possibility since it may mean the availability of state funding for select world team members as well as the possibility of increased funding for anti-doping efforts but that is still just a future possibility.  Part of the IPF brand includes consistent competition conditions and enforcement of the rules but there are definitely regional feds that offer the same.  They don't hold a monopoly on that by any means.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:15 2015 UTC,Plus if you're really elite in the untested arena you're trying to do things like RUM and if your lifts are legit it doesn't necessarily matter what fed you qualify in.

I could understand if meet fees were cheaper but they're the same price as RPS, which has no membership fees. I'm a natural raw lifter so usapl definitely suits me better but I just can't justify the membership card.

Usapl its 85 dollars for a meet llus a 40 dollar annual membership fee. I can't find anything that explains what exactly that membership fee goes towards.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,statasaurus,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"Usually for most IPF affiliates, membership fees go towards drug testing at national events. USAPL should be using WADA labs (but then again USAPL has lots of special snowflake rules) which makes the tests pretty pricey.   Then you've got things like national meet fees - renting venues is expensive, equipment costs (Eleiko et al plates are fucking expensive!), maybe subsidy fees to each regional division if applicable (I'm assuming this is done by state in USAPL) who get to decide what to do with that money, and potentially expenses to cover officials travel etc."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,RedSpikeyThing,2,Sat Jul 18 17:07:54 2015 UTC,special snowflake rules   Most USAPL drug testing is not done through WADA labs to maintain a lower price per test and allow for more testing to be done on a limited budget. Unlike other IPF affiliates there is no state support for testing in the USAPL--it is a self-funded enterprise.  USAPL does not put on meets itself except for the Arnold meets. All other meets including national meets are put on by meet directors acting as independent contractors.  There are no subsidies to state organizations in the USAPL.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,RedSpikeyThing,2,Sat Jul 18 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"I think this is also a major reason for the push for Olympic/IOC recognition.

In the IPF it would work like today,  except instead of being banned you would just be banned from the tested division.   You don't really get failed drug test in Feds that have an untested division because people just compete where they should."

powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,0,Fri Jul 17 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"1st was borderline as fuck. 2nd was good. Third he failed. In fact, his coach/mentor/person he eventually blocked contact with, has/had a perfect video from a different angle that he didn't show anyone. My guess is because he didn't want to tell Toos the truth"
powerlifting,3dnnmw,chuckechaps,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:07 2015 UTC,Rulebook in the IPF states essentially states borderline lifts hsould be given to the lifter.   So both of those lifts should have been white lighted.  You can't have an impossible standard that IS NOT even what your rules dictate is the standard.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"So borderline from a front side view, thus a white light from front judge. Probably clear for side judges.   Not to mention the guy squats high as fuck in training."

The issue is that when this happens, everyone touting the IPF/USAPL love to pretend that this issue IS NOT as prominent as it actually is.  This is really what brings out the frustration in the lifters that do not want to lift in the USAPL/IPF, well, that and the fact that people won't shut up about it being drug tested.  Are we still pretending that 5'0"" guy with the 36 BMI is natural? Are we?"

I thought things had gone overboard with all that FFMI nonsense, now the natty police even thinks a too high BMI is a sign of juice?  It could be he is fat or he has unusual proportions (which he does) or both.  At one point I was 5'9"" with a BMI of 35.  I wasn't even lifting, I was just obese."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,-3,Fri Jul 17 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"Let's just say, for the sake of argument, you're right.  You really have seen 1000 calls.  Which you haven't, as if you were competing, you would've been waiting, not watching everyone compete, and if you were volunteering, you'd have been loading, spotting, etc...and not actually being mindful of the calls AS YOU SHOULD BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING YOUR LIFTER SAFE.  But let's just say you HAVE seen 1000 calls.  So you're saying 1.5% of the people that pay good money to compete, buy equipment, a hotel / drive time, to go to the meet...get to get fucked because someone wasn't paying attention.  Sounds awesome."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,ceejayess,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where people go around thinking the judge ""wasn't paying attention"". You know when you're driving a car and you do your shoulder check but the car was in your blind spot and you go ''whoops'' and then admit you sorta fucked up? That's what judging is like.   You're good 98.5% of the time, which is pretty fucking spot on IMO, and you fuck up extremely rarely.   Do you think judges go around saying, ""haha I'm going to red light so many people!!""?   I've spoken to judges privately and I've never ever heard any of them make any sort of negative comment regarding how they like to judge individuals.   Every single judge I've spoken to says they want lifters to have white lights. Moreso, they admit that they do fuck up on occassion."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:20 2015 UTC,FWIW I've been to 3 USAPL meets in person and watched countless meet videos and I can't think of a blatantly bad call off the top of my head. I have some slight problems with the IPF but I stand by their judging.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,ceejayess,4,Fri Jul 17 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxQ8R3W7auk Both of those squats in his video were good.  If you disagree you're blind.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=eDNLh5d3zlE What's that?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Kx6kARjgcsU Hrm, I'm seeing a pattern.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=r7sJS5CWKGw Hrmm.....  From an article on Elite FTS:   There are two problems with requiring a standard of depth beyond what the rulebook describes. The first problem is fairness and respect. Lifters have trained for months and often traveled significant distance at considerable expense to compete at a meet. Fair judging is the most fundamental respect they deserve. When referees red light squats that aren't even borderline good but clearly deep, an obnoxious theft has occurred. (Speaking of borderline situations, IPF policy is that ""All doubt must be made in favor of the lifter."" Policy and practice are often two different things though.)   This stuff happens way more often than it ever should.  Every USAPL / IPF meet some poor sap is getting burned due to ridiculous judging standards.  Edit:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsNAthtTBE  A simple YouTube search results in more, and more, and more of these."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,7,Fri Jul 17 21:17:07 2015 UTC,"Lol, I'm an actual USAPL referee and I personally know many others from state level referees, to national level, to IPF Cat I referees (the highest level). I've never tried to enforce the rules beyond what is written in the rulebook, and I've never heard or seen any of the judges who I personally know do so either.   At IPF events judges will be removed by the jury if they make bad calls. That includes passing high squats or not passing good squats. Again, I've personally seen this happen.   You can't cherry pick a handful of examples and say 'all USAPL/IPF refs force people to squat below the standard in the rulebook'."
powerlifting,3dnnmw,chuckechaps,4,Sat Jul 18 03:20:11 2015 UTC,I could care less about the IPF but I still think you're being dumb.  Bad calls are going to happen. NFL referees etc are paid and trained EXTREMELY well compared to IPF judges... look at how many bad calls they make.   Every once and a while you're going to get a bad call. That's life. I swear to god I've touched my butt to my heels and been called for not going low enough. It's going to happen to you at least once or twice in your career so get over it and move on. You don't get glitz and glamour in powerlifting.
powerlifting,3dnnmw,Benxbec,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"You bring up valid points but I think that legitimately bad calls are few and far between in the IPF. I also think that it's better than the opposite, which would be the SPF/IPA."

Didn't Shawna Mendelson post something about the meet being a ""shitshow"" and then pull the post?  I can't find her original post, but it seems like the IPA exec was going to retract the entire meet's results for those initial stated issues then at the last moment decided that this stupid technicality (sanctioning a meet) can absolve them from addressing the true concerns.  Shawna is avoiding the storm of having to deal with the Lilliebridges.  Now the Lilliebridges can blame Corey for the meet going haywire and not Shawna.    This entire thing is a shitshow.  Poor judging and allegedly incorrect weigh-in procedure ruined the meet.  IPA exec was forced to take a stand due to public outcry.  Shawna initially went about possibly retracting the meet on the correct grounds, but then found some loophole to get around having to deal with the Lilliebridges and now Corey is the scapegoat.  At the end the IPA does not address the initial concerns."

The smart move would have been (hello there Occam's razor) to void the meet results and records, apologize profusely for the lack of oversight that led to such an absurd lack of standards, have the state chair lay low for a while and tighten up standards. All this does now is take the issue from being isolated to destroying the credibility of the IPA as a whole. It's not like EliteFTS is some dipshit website that 50 people read.

The IPF does have some stock in their big name lifters, why would they want them going to competing organizations?

Docs call the extra L6 since it sits in a lumbar like position but it's shaped like a sacral vertebra.  The disks on either side of it are gone and have been for about 14 years.  You can continue to lift but you do need to learn your limits, learn to listen to your back and quit as soon as you feel like something is about to go wrong.  No ""one more rep"" because that's usually when things get ugly.  I did my last meet with the bad disks so back to 100% is kind of hard to say.  I don't know for sure where I might have got to without the bad disks but I squatted 805 in a single ply suit and pulled 755 about a year after the initial diagnosis.   My advice is to strengthen everything around the injury and avoid things that hit the area directly including stretching.  Keep your middle and upper back flexible, keep your glutes and hamstrings flexible and let your lower back be a rock.  It's kept me going this long."

Now my training is a roller coaster.  Some days are great and others are terrible.  You just have to listen to your body.

powerlifting,3dmrry,zimdy,5,Fri Jul 17 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with the same thing in May. Since then I've tied or PRed on all four lifts. The biggest thing I've learned from my injury was the importance of proper bracing. If I don't brace properly, there's no way I'm lifting anywhere close to max.   My advice to you, aside from learning how to brace, is to number one listen to your body. If something hurts, don't do it. If you have access to a reverse hyper, I've heard they're miracle workers. I've had some success with hyper extensions."

Isotonic will work better than isometric provided you use light weight (<= 40% 1RM), avoid end range flexion and hyperextension, and don't use high volume or high frequency"

powerlifting,3dmrry,Fabuloux,2,Fri Jul 17 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I had a similar injury- bulging l5-s1 and osteoarthritis in the facet joint there. The injury occurred last summer, I initially thought it was some type of muscular thing so i just took a week or two off, then slowly built back up to powerlifting and playing rugby. This did not resolve it, so in december/January I saw a doctor, got an MRI, and started physical therapy. The doctor and PT told me to stay away from lower body until they cleared me, which I did. After a few months they said I was gtg- my back felt so much better that I hit a 6 plate deadlift on my first day back- a big PR. I find that my back gets ""tired"" more easily- I am still working on strengthening the area to help with instability there. This does affect my training to some degree, as I usually keep deadlift volume lower since it gets tired quickly, but I would say I am pretty close to 100%."

powerlifting,3djpkm,MN1H,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"I would not call him an ipf lifter per se. He has not competed in ipf in several years and as far as i know not in the ADAMS program which i believe several of the top IPF lifters are, among CYC.    It basically means that they have to report a place and time for each day of the year where they are available for testing. I would not be suprised if JNorris previous retreat from IPF was to avoid this so he can continue with his own thing and then come back and set world records when everything is cycled out of his body."
powerlifting,3djpkm,Anders85,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:12:30 2015 UTC,"except that he was OMT by the USAPL in 2013, a couple years after his last participation in an IPF meet.

Layne Norton has been training nearly as long as Jesse has been alive, he has dedicated his life around training, he is one of the best natural lifters in the world and Norris' total is nearly 300lbs better than Norton's.  The dude is on gear and a lot of it."
powerlifting,3djpkm,northernhiro,30,Thu Jul 16 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"Norris has been dominating world wide competition since he was 17 (and competing at worlds from 2009-2011, ages 16-18).  Are you saying his parents have been juicing him up since he was a kid but in a sophisticated way since he's also passed in and out of meet drug tests while he was doing that?  I'm not saying he's drug free because I don't know for sure but it seems like it defeats Occam's Razor to try to claim his lifting performances are part of an orchestrated attempt to cheat the system for going on 6 years now.    Norris is far above those currently competing in the USAPL but it's also not like powerlifting records are populated by the cream of the north american athletic crop, especially in the wt classes that compete with traditional sports like wrestling, football, baseball, and track and field.   Until Norris fails a test, it's just as likely that he's an excellent athlete that, for whatever reason, decided to put his time and energy into powerlifting instead of football or baseball.  The rank and file of any powerlifting federation (and I'd put myself in that category for sure) are just a bunch of failed or never was athletes that have found something fun.  That there are lifters 3,4,5 std deviations above the average federation member isn't very surprising at all, it should be expected."
powerlifting,3djpkm,BaronVonMannsechs,20,Thu Jul 16 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"I don't care if Norris is juicing or not (I like to believe in extreme outliers, even in a small sport), but plenty of people start before the age of 17."
powerlifting,3djpkm,theNightblade,2,Fri Jul 17 00:14:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.    I know a few people when I was in high school that were juicing.  Looking back it's kind of sad that they needed that boost, that early."
powerlifting,3djpkm,zimdy,9,Fri Jul 17 12:46:28 2015 UTC,Yeah the guy clearly won the genetic lottery when it comes to this stuff. No way gear alone would make anyone else total over 10x bodyweight at ~200lbs. I just don't know if genetics alone would bring you there.

Besides which, if you're the by far the best in your weight category regardless of natty/not status, why bother being so insistent that you're not on?

It happens in other sports pretty commonly.  Obviously he is a phenomenal talent, but to say that he is just naturally that much better doesn't do your comparison to other IPF lifters justice.  Using that logic Norris is to other powerlifters what LeBron James is to old guys at the YMCA.  He isn't just beating the competition, he is handily outtotaling them in the warmup room."
powerlifting,3djpkm,Gary_Oldman_AMA,17,Fri Jul 17 00:02:50 2015 UTC,It won't be suspicious at all when he totals more than the highest weight class at worlds.
powerlifting,3djpkm,northernhiro,5,Fri Jul 17 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"it isn't that crazy of a thought that Norris has had a coach or parent that has had him on the sauce at 17. It happens in other sports pretty commonly.   I'm not saying you're wrong or it's impossible but a really big difference to keep in mind here is that other sports, unlike powerlifting, can have a great deal of prestige and/or potential for financial gain. I mean, get your kid an edge in high school and they could have a shot at a full ride at a D1 or D2 school.  Get them noticed/in the right program early enough in other sports and they could have a shot at the olympics or going pro at something.  That's not really the case in powerlifting.  Putting your kid on juice at an early age so they can be great at an underground, fringe sport that YOU pay money to have them compete in, even at the highest levels, seems like all risk with none of the possible reward.  Nobody gets on a Wheaties box for powerlifitng.  I feel like the biggest reason it happens in other sports is because there's actually an incentive/really high potential reward in most other sports.   Using that logic Norris is to other powerlifters what LeBron James is to old guys at the YMCA.   No, I think it's more like comparing Michael Jordan in his prime to your average D2 or D1 athlete.  Your D2 or D1 guy may be a really gifted athlete but the difference between them and someone like MJ is so vast that it's just stupid."
powerlifting,3djpkm,BaronVonMannsechs,8,Fri Jul 17 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"That analogy actually works because there is nowhere near the saturation of talent in powerlifting, even in the IPF that is present in pro basketball.  Norris quite likely is a Lebron in a sea of D-leaguers, juiced or not."

While I've never competed at the international level, over that many years, you see enough outliers over the years that you just don't feel comfortable attaching limits to performances.

I guess the fed should've been ruined when Carl Yngvar Christensen came in and totalled 1230kg, or when Sergey Fedosienko set the highest wilks ever recorded. It's not uncommon to see some of the greatest lifters ever in the IPF. Same shit with Ed Coan, why didn't the IPF get ruined then huh? Even though we all know Coan was using."
powerlifting,3djpkm,VladYev,8,Fri Jul 17 02:20:37 2015 UTC,What? Coan was caught
powerlifting,3djpkm,Lou__Tennant,5,Fri Jul 17 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"Ok and how do you know Norris won't be caught if he really is doping? That wasn't even my point, the original statement was that ""Norris is so good that he must be using drugs, and the IPF will be ruined if he gets to compete."" There are other lifters who are as insanely good as he is in the IPF and it's clear it hasn't hurt the IPF in any way, just like Norris competing won't, even if he was to get caught."
powerlifting,3djpkm,TheAesir,11,Fri Jul 17 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"He was still able to compete after failing multiple times though. Don't get me wrong, Coan is a legend even among non-natty lifters, and I love the IPF, but I think they could be more strict on those who fail drug tests for anabolic steroid use (stimulants aren't as important, in my opinion). I would respect Coan more if he never competed in the IPF. In my opinion, if you test positive for anabolic steroids once in the IPF, you should get a lifetime ban and the results from every competition you competed in should be erased. There will probably always be people juicing in the IPF, but why not be as harsh as possible if they're caught?"
powerlifting,3djpkm,northernhiro,0,Fri Jul 17 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"you should get a lifetime ban and the results from every competition you competed in should be erased.   Based on this argument, one could argue that the IPF is only faining an interest in drug testing to get into the Olympics. If they truly cared about it previously, they would have removed the records set by lifters like Coan."
powerlifting,3djpkm,TheAesir,3,Fri Jul 17 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"fwiw, on the IPF website, they don't link to any retired records.  The only World Records for classic or equipped are ones set in the new weight classes.  If the retired records are archived somewhere, the IPF doesn't make it easy to find.  also, the IPF does expunge records set by lifters that fail a drug test.  Robert Yamasaki held records in the M3 equipped division from 2013 that were annulled as a result of his 2014 drug test failure at the 2014 Classic Worlds."
powerlifting,3djpkm,Isilrac23,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"I realize that, but the point was the records stood till the classes were changed. The classes were changed so the IPF could distance themselves from the rest of the sport and make an Olympic bid."
powerlifting,3djpkm,walnut_of_doom,7,Fri Jul 17 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"But he can't bench 400, and there's 181s pulling 700.  Layne has his squat and that's about it. Just for my comparison I'm approaching a 700deadlift and looking to hit 370-380 bench by the end of the year, hopefully 365-370 in October at end of my prep.  My squats ass(500) however I party hard on the weekends and work 60hrs a week landscaping. I've been lifting 5years, 3 bro lifting and powerlifting for 2.   I weigh 195lbs and I only take creatine. Always have been natural. The one guy garazzo hasn't been lifting nearly as long as Layne and just put up 1675, 600+squat and 700+ deadlift at 93kg? And natural.  I'm not saying Norris is natural, but there's freaks out there who can put up big numbers easy. Maybe Layne has shitty genetics and leverages  and has had to work his ass off to achieve the level he is at now , while others are Just meant to lift heavy weight half assing it."
powerlifting,3djpkm,ozzorag,6,Fri Jul 17 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah most of the freaks in America are playing football at one level or another. One such example is a 240 lb defensive end at my school that squats 600 without wraps, sleeves, or a belt, benches just south of 500, and based on his clean, could probably pull 7-800. He doesn't even train for power lifting and only maxes out once or twice a year, but could easily dominate the local 220 weight class if he did a water cut and actually trained his 90%+ weights."
powerlifting,3djpkm,psicicle,3,Fri Jul 17 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"Chiming in here since my name came up :), I largely agree, I watched Kevin Oak total 2100 last week after cutting down from 240 and pretty sure he doesn't claim natty - it was impressive.  I think the trouble people have is believing a guy considerably lighter than the best 220's is totaling near what they are without cutting and without gear. Norris weighed in at 195 for his 2015 total and said he didn't cut I believe, so we are talking about a 45 lb body weight difference which is hard enough to believe in itself but then throw on the natty status it makes for a mind boggling comparison.   I'd like to think he is natty and who knows maybe I could get there some day myself, but being 32 instead of 22 makes that seem quite impossible.  Until he fails a drug test though the optimist in me believes that 2000+ at 198/205 natty is possible and what I will strive for... whether he is natty or not he is still a freak."
powerlifting,3djpkm,flannel_smoothie,9,Fri Jul 17 16:18:17 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically, suppose he was on gear to set a 2015 total What would you expect his total to be as a natural, around 1800? Would you believe an 1800 @198 is possible natty? I suspect the natty police would be just as loud and just as confident."
powerlifting,3djpkm,Isilrac23,8,Fri Jul 17 00:15:25 2015 UTC,I would believe it.
powerlifting,3djpkm,psicicle,8,Fri Jul 17 13:44:06 2015 UTC,"With knee wraps yes. Raw who knows, there's genetic freaks out there.  I'm closing in on 1600, and I half ass this stuff, work 60hrs a week landscaping, and follow 5/3/1.  I walk around 195.  My goal is 1700 before end of next year.  but if I was able to dedicate my life to this like layne or someone else, I highly believe I'd be hitting 1700+ by now.   But then yea natty police, but fuck em."
powerlifting,3djpkm,Isilrac23,9,Fri Jul 17 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"The point I was trying to make is: if we assume 2015 is acheivable with gear, then we can be pretty confident that 1800 is achievable naturally, yet you would see the same overconfident ""no one is world class without drugs"" comments.  I know under 50 serious lifters in real life (all college students at uni gyms btw), and a handful of them are genetically gifted enough that the internet would cry ""drugs!!"". I know a guy squatting near 600 @ 181 (no wraps) after only 4 years of training, another whose squat went from ~365 to nearly 500 in a year @ ~198, a dude who benched 325 flat-backed (because nobody even taught him the ""right way"") after a year of benching and with barely any upper body development at ~170.  When my tiny sample includes these outliers, I am inclined to give Norris the benefit of the doubt.  This wasn't really related to your comment so.. good luck for 1700!"
powerlifting,3djpkm,I_love_bearss,4,Fri Jul 17 14:59:51 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I'm cranky and haven't had coffee.  I def think 1800 is possible with the right genetic freak.  John Haack can probably do it if he moves up to 198, I just don't understand the whole ""he's on drugs cause I can't do it"" like you stated.  Someone else mentioned in one of the comments that the majority of powerlifters are average people who sucked at other sports and are in turn average powerlifters.  I completely agree with that.  Some people are just freaks who were meant to pick up a barbell. Thanks, whenever I decide to stop doing dumbs things on the weekends and get serious hopefully I'll hit my goals."

powerlifting,3djpkm,northernhiro,5,Fri Jul 17 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"They test for specific metabolites.  Have something that metabolizes into something they're not testing for? You're good to go.  Also not sure how many compounds they're testing for, esp. for things like SARMs and whatever prohormones are en vogue at the moment.  Things like HGH are difficult to test for, but people can get popped for it if they test you the day you injected.  Keep your T/E ratios fine and I think test suspension is good to go as well.  See: The BALCO scandal and the MLB.  The only reason those guys got popped was someone gave a white paper on the (rather obscure) compound to the right people."

Norris has been OMT'd 3 times and only once would you actually be able to say it was truly randomly, and none of which were at night. I'm not saying he's on of course, but if people with knowledge in anti-doping agencies are saying its child play to avoid an OCT/ICT with similar protocols it'd be pretty easy to avoid 3 tests.   I've known about microdosing and night time protocols for over a decade. I'm pretty safe in estimating people in IOC recognized sports have known about it for far longer."

powerlifting,3djpkm,BaronVonMannsechs,3,Fri Jul 17 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The thing that makes me somewhat skeptical of all the internet claims of vast doping by tested powerlifters is that the threat of a switcheroo or fake/mislabeled drugs is always there unless they somehow have the funds to support an organization like BALCO or Biogenesis.  When news of athletes getting away with cheating is made, it almost always involves high revenue generating athletics and/or some amount of organizational corruption."

powerlifting,3djpkm,MN1H,5,Fri Jul 17 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"it would depend on how your body responds to testosterone, but yeah. you find out the adverse finding limit, take small amounts of tesosterone in solution with no ester, suspension works too but less well because you can't be certain the clumps will be absorbed super fast, and make sure you'll be under the adverse finding limit in the morning.   unless you get woken up and tested during the night you won't have elevated levels by the morning.   I'm not 100% sure on whether a mass spec will show that the testosterone was synthetic if its cleared completely by the morning.   of course your timing has to be impeccable, any deviations could result in an adverse finding."

He posts typically what he's doing for the day on instagram and I can confirm that it's basically what my program looks like.  Basically the program starts with high reps, low volume and then it begins to accumulate every week. Then it transitions into higher volume and intensity as the rep scheme remains. Here's an example of week 4 for my working sets for deadlift:  2 SETS 10-12 REPS, 2 SETS 8-10 REPS, 2-4 SETS 8-10 REPS,  It was definitely tough for my body to get use to the volume even though I've ran through Sheiko, but eventually adjusted and my form for all my lifts have improved just from the higher reps.   How often do you deadlift?   Deadlift Twice. Deadlift on Mondays and deficit deadlift on Thursday.   He gave me a list of accessory days he typically does, but I told him about my shoulder weakness and he said to add in a few facepulls. These accessory work days are straight up bodybuilding days which is nice.  He also has me doing farmers, sled pushes and tire flips on those days as well for HIIT training."

So far my plan is   Bands -> buy my own band Chains -> replace with bands Blocks -> Stack plates (everyone will hate me since I mostly work out during rush hour) Boards -> Buy a Slingshot, or at least buy a foam block to place under my shirt   With all of that said, I am conflicted as to whether I should even be doing this type of work as a raw lifter. My weakness is the bottom of every lift and these all work the top. Should I just stick to the damn program?   edit: INB4 WenchPolkov tells me to go to Sheiko forums.

Its probably down to bench width though, I am a full wide bencher with relatively wide elbows and am literally all power off the chest. A close-grip with less elbow flare would respond differently and would likely have a more powerful board press.

My right shoulder gives out almost every time, and this is after doing the scapular retraction mentioned in Chris Jones's video.  All the other main lifts, squat, deadlift, ohp, seem to be going well though.

Hepburn himself said that the average lifter can go about 4 months on the program before stalling.  Once you stall on the 8x2 => 8x3 program he recommends switching to the 4x1 => 10x1 singles program.   Build that up for another 4 months or so until you plateau and switch back to the triples program.  Many people report being able to do this for years without stagnating.

I also started this after finishing a Sheiko 12 week program which Nuckols says is the best way to approach it due to work capacity, and preceding volume.  I've already dropped the bench part because I was actually detraining and getting beat up from it, (max going down slowly, and shoulder issues).

powerlifting,3djigl,AngryDevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:51 2015 UTC,depends on you entirely.  I have one friend that has 1 carbnite and eats ~200 or so while staying under 25 the rest of the week.  another friend who stays around 50 or so a day and around 400-500 on his carb nite.

powerlifting,3djigl,Metallicadpa,3,Thu Jul 16 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"General rule is you don't want to go beyond 1% of your total weight per week. So if you weight 270, you could lose 3 pounds a week which is pretty substantial. Think about it, 12 pounds in a single month? Say another 10 the next? That's 22 in two months and I can guarantee no loss of strength. Look at someone like Greg Nuckols, he's losing weight steadily and in truth he has a lot to lose. Patience is key, not only to maintain strength, but to adapt your eating habits as well as minimize excess skin."
powerlifting,3djigl,ghoulmaster,2,Fri Jul 17 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"It helps too if you think of adding ""healthy"" habits instead of removing bad ones. Have trouble getting your protein, add a yogurt that you have to eat every morning post shower. Just build the positive habits and slowly you'll edge out the shitty ones. Also figure out your eating schedule, I love two big meals and snacks between. Finding this stuff out has allowed me to lose 20lbs since Feb."

Will I lose a ton of strength? Or am I better off just doing my best to stay consistent at my weight?"

powerlifting,3djigl,JosephusBroz,5,Thu Jul 16 19:50:04 2015 UTC,Bench: What am I doing wrong with unracking the bar? Sometimes I feel like I unrack it and it flies off the rack to a great starting position. Othertimes it goes up but I can't for the life of me bring it out of the rack after getting it up. I've tried so many random things but I just cant seem to figure out what gets it to pop off the rack easily.
powerlifting,3djigl,Chadlynx,12,Thu Jul 16 22:59:50 2015 UTC,I lift my ass way up to unrack and then set down once I've pulled the bar out of the rack. That helps me stay tight when not getting a lift off.

powerlifting,3djigl,Metallicadpa,3,Thu Jul 16 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"could easily be the type of rack as well.  The racks at my gym have pegs that are angled and are really long ( ~6"") so unracking is a huge pain in the butt.   Comp benches have more unrackable pegs.  Could very possibly just be the bench.    Get a lift off buddy ;)"
powerlifting,3djigl,maranmaran,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:48 2015 UTC,That's what I end up doing. I also have pretty short arms so just pushing it up from the pegs only gives it about an inch of clearance to get it over.
powerlifting,3djigl,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,2,Thu Jul 16 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Get a lift off buddy ;)   With the racks i bench on having somebody help me with the lift off is a difference between either missing or hitting a heavy single, or two extra reps."

powerlifting,3djigl,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:11 2015 UTC,"In the semi-sumo lift you need to push with your legs more to start the movement, you're not using your legs very much, I would say your hips might be slightly too high.  In the conventional lift, your hips are very slightly too low and your butt shoots up. The conventional looks better to me for your leverages."
powerlifting,3djigl,what_the_actual_luck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:15 2015 UTC,I havn't hit a deadlift pr in over a year and its pissing me off to no end since my squat and bench keep trudging along. I am finally starting to realize that i think my squat frequency and intensity is whats holding back my deadlift.
powerlifting,3djigl,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"If your squat numbers are going up, odds are your deadlift is going up as well. The only issue should be grip. If grip isn't the problem, your problably just need a week to rest and let your legs recover for a heavy deadlift session."
powerlifting,3djigl,Lavistao,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:24:08 2015 UTC,Thin is what i thought as well and my deadlift is way stronger if i take time to rest but is still proportionately very low. And my current 1rm is ~ the same as my 5rm was like 16 months ago despite my squat increasing like 50-60 lbs over that time.
powerlifting,3djigl,ladyofthelakeeffect,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:40 2015 UTC,Your leverages may be the reason. If you have extremely short arms or have a long torso/short femur then your deadlifts won't be that high relative to the squat. Also it might be a mental thing if you can't max out heavier than your 5RM.
powerlifting,3djigl,Lavistao,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:39:07 2015 UTC,How to get as tight while deadlifting as when you're using double overhand? Somehow I'm always less tight and am seriously considering straps and learning hook grip to not fuck my back/shoulders up
powerlifting,3djigl,ladyofthelakeeffect,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I wouldn't bother pulling double overhand unless it was with a hook grip. I use a hook grip for singles and occasionally doubles. Anything for reps is done with straps.   A good cue to get tight is to try imagine you have oranges under your armpit. Try to squeeze them hard enough to make orange juice.
powerlifting,3djigl,gettincutgettinbutt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:56 2015 UTC,Definitely worth learning hook grip if you have the patience.
powerlifting,3djigl,Mupt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:40 2015 UTC,But still use mixed grip or just straps for higher rep work?
powerlifting,3djigl,gettincutgettinbutt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"Only if you have to, I mean you could use hook grip for reps, it's just it's really difficult to not have to reset it often.  I'm in the same situation, I used to be able to double over until 400, but now working sets for reps I use mixed grip, but I want to incorporate hook grip because mixed grip is causing imbalance, and I also windmill at the top."

powerlifting,3djigl,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:50:10 2015 UTC,Probably around 30 degrees. Turning them out more is hard because my hips lack mobility.
powerlifting,3djigl,DrColossus1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:03:16 2015 UTC,i might try working on that. turning your feet out a little more can help get your quads out of the way
powerlifting,3djigl,Dreadlifts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:15:33 2015 UTC,I hit a new pr on the sumo deadlift pulling 455 yesterday. I find that getting it off the floor is very easy for me. Where i always fail is the lockout. What muscles do i have to stregthen to make the sumo deadlift lockout easier?
powerlifting,3djigl,DrColossus1,2,Fri Jul 17 19:00:07 2015 UTC,You might be rounding your upper back. This generally leads to your situation. Work on getting into a better starting position and really firing your lats at the start of the pull.
powerlifting,3djigl,Dreadlifts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:47:53 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks. I was wondering if it was just getting into a bad once i got to the lockout. Because i dont hear a lot of people failing on a sumo deadlifts lockout."
powerlifting,3djigl,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:27 2015 UTC,"You mostly need to strengthen your glutes, and also sumo pulls from blocks may help, but as the above poster said it could be your back is rounding or you're losing the bar out in front."

powerlifting,3dhwh7,scarfsnarf,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"Ya sure, the author selected key known famous figures in their respective sports then drew conclusions that all those genetic differences were common or present in all athletes of those regions in those sports.  So if ""kenyan runners"" have won many Olympics in distance running, why don't all kenyans or participate in long distance running?  By percentage how many Olympic level Kenyan runners exists in the Kenyan population.  Everything about the article could be picked apart."
powerlifting,3dhwh7,James72090,2,Fri Jul 17 03:23:59 2015 UTC,You missed the point-the author gave pure counterexamples to your argument that it's just another factor of equal weight to the others in training when in fact you can't train to have a longer Achilles tendon for high jumping and you can't try really hard to have the perfect proportion of levers for the snatch etc etc He did not draw generalizations about populations- he pointed out the inherent unfairness of sports.  The man who has a GENETIC mutation that creates 20% more red blood cells will beat your ass at a particular endurance  sport with the same amount of training or even less training than you- sorry
powerlifting,3dhwh7,scarfsnarf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:13:51 2015 UTC,Ilya Ilin will beat my ass at snatching and clean and jerks no matter how much juice and professional training because I have this dopey frame with long femurs and long torso - I'm 6 foot 3 inches tall and have a 18 inch vertical jump but it's still worth training hard

powerlifting,3dhwh7,gnuckols,-34,Thu Jul 16 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"That clickbait title though.  Since this 'transformation' Greg posted on Facebook I'm losing what little faith I had in his content.    Muscle size is ultimately determined by how many myonuclei a muscle fiber has; there is a maximum area they can “oversee,” and once they reach that limit, you stop growing unless you can add more.    This isn't entirely true, you can still hypertrophy those nuclei, which is exactly -as he says- why muscle memory works.  The whole article can be summarized as  ""When staleness/pleateaus occur, take some time off to be more fresh in training""  I don't understand why it has to be a huge length essay to convey that information, and I really don't like his writing style.  I don't think that's anything new or profound.  and reading his Bulgarian Manual, if you have read Matt Perryman's Squat Everyday it's almost like he copied the entire thing and tried to add a few bullshit theories in there."
powerlifting,3dhwh7,razzark666,46,Thu Jul 16 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"1) It was literally just a post bragging on a friend, and I made it clear that I wasn't using it to promote anything, nor was I actively coaching him (just gave him some basic guidelines to follow, and that was it).  It's the exact same thing as sharing a friend's PR video and saying ""huge props to my friend for making sweet gainz.""  Then the internet took it and ran with it.  2) An article has to have a premise to get people to read it.  I wanted people to learn about myonuclear domain theory.  And if the training implications you took away from it were ""When staleness/pleateaus occur, take some time off to be more fresh in training,"" then I'm quite pleased with that.  3) if you're looking for things that are new or profound, stop reading all fitness content.  Seriously.  If that's your intention, I can't think of a bigger waste of time.  I've seen maybe 2 original ideas in the past 10 years (blood flow restriction, and I'm leaving myself a cushion, but I honestly can't think of a second).  4) Matt was/is 100% cool with the Bulgarian Manual, which was written to address the biggest concern people had with his book (the actual application side of things).  If you feel like it was a waste of your time, I'll gladly refund you the $0 you paid for it."
powerlifting,3dhwh7,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,-34,Thu Jul 16 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"1) Ok, not really sure why you felt the need to respond to this.  2) I'm already familiar with the idea. I get that it's good to explain things but for me essentially I have to skim read anything on your site, the takeaway points are usually good, but in this one they did not convey the takeaway point which was as you quoted.  3) Sure, the principles have not changed in 10 years, there haven't been any big game changers, however there are plenty of new programming methods, and occasionally studies of interest which come to light. Also it's not like I claim to know everything, I can still piece together things which are new to me, although that sort of content isn't found on youtube or facebook usually.  4) That makes some sense, his section on application was the shortest part of the book. I don't actually like this style of training, I have been doing it for about a month, and so far I'm getting nowhere, I took it up as I have some time out from regular training to experiment.  I felt your other books were a waste of time for me too, I got more out of Practical Programming, could you refund me for those?"

I'm a bit sceptical of the whole thing, the second pictures are pumped with scapula retracted, and while a significant amount of the weight is previously lost LBM, a large amount of it is probably water/glycogen unless the guy is on drugs."

But I guess making it clear that I'm not taking on clients and laying out both his diet and training   Limited availability is one of the best marketing tools out there, and as I mentioned in another comment you do make money from good advertising because you sell books, and also I'm assuming, your Youtube content is monetized in some form.   (nowhere did I claim it was a magic training program or macro intake - and if it was, why would I then tell everyone exactly what it was?    Neither did I, hence the apostrophe's surrounding those words, there was a fairly clear emphasis in the post initially regarding the macros of high carbs, low fat, high protein, and also that he was using a training program which you suggested, although that was somewhat edited out later from what I can tell."
powerlifting,3dhwh7,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,11,Thu Jul 16 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"You have the post right there.  If it was a marketing tool, where were the links to my books?  Where were the links to any of my email hooks?  Hell, where were the links to any of my articles to drive site traffic?  And no, it's not a scarcity-driven tactic for coaching.  Screenshot from my inbox:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/zks4csz1huebeb3/Screenshot%202015-07-16%2012.00.53.png?dl=0  Those are all unread training applications from the past month.  The three that are read are 2 recommending other coaches to people, and one to my wife making sure the application forms were working right for a new coach we'd just hired...since I'm not taking on any new clients for the time being."
powerlifting,3dhwh7,LTUTD,-11,Thu Jul 16 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well considering that Omar Isuf who you have some sort of marketing deal put up a video not long after about this very topic, and it somewhat went viral I don't think it's necessary for a direct link, whether or not you intended for it to be viewed largely on a public scale that wasn't the reason I brought it up, something about the whole thing felt off to me, and there are a lot of other sceptics too on this transformation, there is nothing stopping someone from taking steroids and lying about it, although that is obviously speculation. I think the real outcome was from lots of water weight gain, post pump pictures, and a little scapula retraction to create this 'whoosh magic trick'  Alright, we/I don't need pictures of your inbox to prove a point, of course the whole thing is good marketing whether intentional or not, as I said that was besides my point."

powerlifting,3dhwh7,ladyofthelakeeffect,-12,Thu Jul 16 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"That's what people are reacting to.   No it's not, people don't like views that differ from their own opinions (and for the ill informed, unpopular opinions), no matter how I phrased it I would be downvoted because of the general sentiment I made.  Also, to all the folks that got this far in the comment thread and downvoted, you might want to start forming your own viewpoints, and look in the mirror, if someone can't express their point of view without being personally insulted then I don't think this is a very open minded or friendly community."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,rep_it_out,76,Thu Jul 16 03:00:44 2015 UTC,"This is a great step in the right direction. People need to stop pretending that a lifter is infallible because he or she is strong. Having a world record doesn't mean a squat isn't high or you didn't break the rules. While obviously experienced coaches, lifters, and judges criticisms hold more merit than a random internet user, the ""you can't lift that much so you can't judge, you can't judge depth from the front, and shut up and lift"" mentality is one of the dumbest parts of the powerlifting community. Everyone should care about ethics and rules being upheld if you pay to be part of the sport. You don't get a pass just because you are stronger than other competitors."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,JMFIT,27,Thu Jul 16 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Ed Coan himself said in one of the supertraining videos that the idea that you can't see depth from the front is bs and it's your responsibility to make your lifts unquestionable. I don't understand the ""up!"" cues that some of those lifters use like the 181 guy in that meet that said Eric called him up and so he knows he went low enough. Hitting depth should be the only way you know how to squat period"
powerlifting,3dgn4v,zimdy,10,Thu Jul 16 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"""up"" calls are for multiply lifting really. in briefs and canvas I could never feel my depth so I had to rely on a training partner. I always told them I'd rather get buried in the hole than squat high though...  single ply and raw though I was always able to feel my depth.   I'm sure there have been some multiply lifters able to feel their depth so they didn't have to have an up call, but its not a common thing."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,140kgPowerSmith,4,Thu Jul 16 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"In the same interview, Coan mentions that any amount of doubt, from the judge, regarding depth should be given to the lifter. If judges have this mindset, then getting a red shouldn't bother a lifter. It should mean that they were high without a question."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,limbo2007,-5,Thu Jul 16 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"That would be me, which you can hear him in the video. I trust that Eric knows depth so why not go up when he tells me to, they don't add 10kg or nothing if I go further."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,MikeLucia23,16,Thu Jul 16 16:31:29 2015 UTC,Nothing personal I'm just saying I don't understand that cue and you avoid this kind of controversy when good depth is just built into your technique.

powerlifting,3dgn4v,maranmaran,5,Thu Jul 16 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it as a joke, I was serious, I mean I don't think that you should define seriousness by an amount of spectators to me thats just called popularity if powerlifting was popular as hell than it would have more people watching it. It's serious to a certain amount of people who actually know what are they looking at. There's really ton's of sports that are quite serious yet they don't have a broad spectar of spectators. Team sports, amount of cash invested in the sport or is flowing around the sport / is the sport suited for betting etc, country / continent, popularity impact that."

I went to a wedding across the country last weekend. I had train late after setting up the day before, and woke up at 5am so I wouldn't miss training before the ceremony.   Just because I take it seriously, doesn't make it a serious sport.  I understand how boring meets are to watch, unless you're really into it who's who. There is no such thing as a casual fan. Powerlifting has been great for me, and I love it, but at the end of the day we're just a bunch of people lifting weights."

powerlifting,3dgn4v,sergei650,3,Thu Jul 16 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Olympic lifting is more excited because of the expository of the lists. Strong man has much more events, where they move/lift/carry odd heavy things people can relate to, not just a bar with some plates on. Crossfit and NPGL is not the same thing over and over again.  All of these are much more entertaining than powerlifting, and as you stated that's part of being a sport."

powerlifting,3dgn4v,A_Meat_Popsicle,19,Thu Jul 16 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"So the only reason they're voiding the meet is that there was no request to sanction it beforehand? So even if it was run perfectly and every call, lift, and weigh-in was by the book, they still wouldn't count only because the state chair didn't file for sanctioning?  So they're saying the touch and go benches, squats so high they were in orbit, and nonexistent weigh-ins had nothing to do with them throwing this meet out."
powerlifting,3dgn4v,frak8757,55,Thu Jul 16 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"well, the sanctioning request not being submitted allows them to void the meet without getting into a specific debate about every single call... meet director gave them that out, they took it.  To me the fact that they failed to even submit for sanctioning shows how little of a fuck they gave, so whatever"
powerlifting,3dgn4v,slayer02348,6,Thu Jul 16 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"If they hadn't sanctioned the meet, you'd think they would have said so.  ""Hey guys.  This meet is currently unsanctioned.""

powerlifting,3dgn4v,MikeLucia23,9,Thu Jul 16 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Meet director is a friend on facebook... he posted text conversation between him and the head of the IPA this morning saying the meet was okay to be sanctioned for last weekend.

If someone had hands on him, that's a different story (and it does look like they were touching the weights). The issue with the weigh-ins another completely different story, but yeah...    I'm glad he kept the conversations because there's no fucking way on earth they 1) didn't know this meet was going on and 2) would let someone tout their organization if it wasn't ""sanctioned"" on some level.

Has posted texts with the head of the IPA saying they were good to host the meet, and is pissed because the IPA accepted the sanction payment from him.... on top of that, the IPA in their post promised to refund money to lifters, and aren't- they're saying the meet director will refund it.... honestly, the IPA just sounds like a class act all around right now.  Not suprisingly, no response or posts at all about the judging or weigh ins, just ""we followed the same protocol as our last meet, which the IPA didn't discredit""."

powerlifting,3dgn4v,slayer02348,2,Thu Jul 16 13:53:41 2015 UTC,It's much easier to blame the meet director on a technicality - whether true or not - than it is to call out some well known names with the allegations made.

powerlifting,3dgn4v,LTUTD,9,Thu Jul 16 05:49:11 2015 UTC,"My understanding on the matter is that the amateur pool in some federations is meant to be more novice friendly and offer an environment in which people can compete without feeling pressured to use PEDs to keep up with competition. I know RPS does something similar. You are correct, however, in noting that there's about 5 people on the planet who actually make their living powerlifting, and in that sense we're all amateurs."

It becomes one of those things where you don't make money from lifting in the same way an NFL player would make money from playing football, but being distinguished in lifting means people want to learn from you, so you charge for coaching, and maybe you come out with an ebook that people buy, then you sell merchandise, then maybe you get some cash from sponsors, get big enough and do seminars etc."

powerlifting,3dgn4v,BIG-ASSTEROIDS,3,Thu Jul 16 06:33:39 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I can tell, in the IPA it's just whether or not you wanna compete tested or not, anyone can compete in either. I think it used to be that once you hit a certain total you had to compete in professional though. But in general, I guess it's whether you make a living off of the sport or not?"

powerlifting,3di5yp,bladetips,4,Thu Jul 16 18:26:25 2015 UTC,Just make sure to bulk slow so you don't have to cut for a very long time.
powerlifting,3di5yp,delph,3,Thu Jul 16 19:49:14 2015 UTC,What would you say is cutting too long? 12 week cut the max?
powerlifting,3di5yp,DrakeTaylor,3,Thu Jul 16 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yup. Looking back, an 8-10 week cut would of been way better. That'd be enough to lose 5-8 lbs and not be too hard."
powerlifting,3di5yp,delph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"I find that people who need to cut more than that 8-10 week range are either just chubbier than they want to be, assuming they lose at a reasonable rate.   I do understand the idea of cutting to 10%~ then bulking 15%~, but some people, including me, have cut for 12 weeks, lost 1lbs/week, BUT just arrived at that ideal cutting %, which is 15%~.  I guess that range only works if you're reasonably lean in the first place."
powerlifting,3di5yp,RedSpikeyThing,2,Fri Jul 17 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but it depends on your goals and current body composition and lifting age. 12 week cut is pretty long, but if you have a lot of fat to lose, it may be the best move. I'm cutting now and, after it, I plan on only bulking so much that a 4 week cut is all I'll have to do to get back to where I'd like to be. I let my last/first bulk get a little too aggressive after getting to ~10% BF or less, but being weak and wanting to get kind of strong. Nothing horrible but gained 5-10 pounds more than I would have liked. At least I hit 1200, though."
powerlifting,3di5yp,delph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what I'm gonna do. Slow bulk at .25-.5 lbs a week until I hit about 180."
powerlifting,3di5yp,RedSpikeyThing,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan. If you get a little too fluffy, just cut for 2-4 weeks to lean out a bit."
powerlifting,3di5yp,delph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:16 2015 UTC,How hard to you typically cut? I bulked up and am sitting at ~15% now. Cutting down to 10% would take a while unless I cut aggressively. Definitely not bulking as hard next time lol
powerlifting,3di5yp,BenchPolkov,2,Sun Jul 19 13:19:55 2015 UTC,"How many pounds do you have to lose? Experts like Eric Helms and Layne Norton suggest that losing 1% of you bodyweight per week us ok, but I believe any more is risky to muscle mass. Slower is ok, too, if it's sustainable and makes you feel better. You'll perform better with a smaller caloric deficit."
powerlifting,3di5yp,greenalleycat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"I'm at 193 lbs and guesstimating 15% bodyfat. My math says that I have ~10 lbs of bodyfat to lose to get to 10% bf. I don't actually care if I get to 10%, it's more to remove a bit of fluff before bulking again.  The 1% suggestion would come out to 1.8-1.9 lbs/week which seems fast to me, but hey I'll try it if it gets the job done in 5-6 weeks!"
powerlifting,3di5yp,BenchPolkov,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"It seems fast to me, too. I'm currently losing about 1 pound a week, and I'm at 187, probably around 15% bf, too. My bench feels weaker, but everything else feels ok."

I've seen guys wearing basketball shorts who are astonished when their hands get in the way at lockout. Nike running shorts are a nice balance between short and not looking like you're gunning for an Arthur Ashe courage award. Additionally, I find the 3/4th length spandex is pretty solid. Just wear a looser t-shirt so your nuts aren't out and nobody will think twice.  Lastly, I recommend the hook grip. The symmetry of the hands is particularly helpful on the sumo dead, where a lot of people experience windmilling at lockout with a mixed grip."

The key is to start slow and then eventually ramp up the work/volume. If your ultimate goal is to do 3x8 after your squats, you could start with 1x8 your first week, 2x8 the second week, then 3x8 the third week. You might find that it's too easy (or too hard) and you can adjust accordingly.   There's a ton of ways of going about it, but just keep it slow and steady so you don't throw too much at yourself up front."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,JosephusBroz,15,Thu Jul 16 06:36:35 2015 UTC,"Food for thought.   Let's make assumption that there is in fact a percentage of lifters in the IPF who are enhanced and find ways to test negative on drug testing protocols. Wouldn't the fact that drug testing is involved be a deterrent in itself against the use of drugs, or entirely prevent a certain population of enhanced lifters from wanting to compete in the IPF?   I'd like to think that by this virtue alone, IPF would have a significantly fewer enhanced lifters than federations that do not test outright."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,JMFIT,21,Wed Jul 15 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"PED use is extremely common in the IPF. If I remember correctly there was a big time lifter who went to IPF worlds some years ago and went dinner with a bunch of the other big name lifters. He wrote about how they were talking about their cycles leading into the meet and he was surprised about how abundant it was among athletes. I think the IPF is the most legitimate fed out there, but to think it is not riddled with drug use is just silly. Like every other professional sports organization with testing, they try to catch users but they will never be able to keep up with PED users."

So realistically what can these guys be on on meet day and still pass assuming they actually piss in the cup themselves and aren't swapping urine?   I'm not talking about what they might run in the ""off season"" that might clear their system by the meet- what can they be on on meet day? I'm assuming they can't be on a bunch of test and tren then pop some halo behind the platform...."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,ceejayess,6,Thu Jul 16 02:31:52 2015 UTC,Some test esters will clear your system very quickly. Plus there's a whole boatload of other niche shit you've never heard of and I haven't researched that nobody ever pops for that is still pretty available.

powerlifting,3dfcvn,kobaltdog,5,Thu Jul 16 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"I don't try to beat drug tests but this is my understanding of it. There's stuff that's so new it isn't tested for- various peptides, (apparently) SARMS, things like that. And it's my understanding that GH and IGF can't reliably be detected.   Of course, being tested on meet day isn't really the problem- you know exactly when meet day is going to be, so you know exactly when you need to be clean by. You can build up a great deal of strength out of competition and be clean in a couple of weeks if you're taking the appropriate compounds- and it can take a month or more for a loss of strength to kick in after you stop taking them. Since the weeks before the meet is spent tapering, focusing on technique, etc, and not doing heavy training, you'll still be good to go to on meet day.  It's the no-notice out-of competition testing that's a real concern. For that, you can just run things that will be out of your system quickly and duck the test if it becomes an issue. Just pretend you're unavailable until you're clean, you're allowed a certain number of missed tests in a given time period before you actually get in trouble.   If you are tested unexpectedly or somehow fuck up and have things in your system that are detectable, and you can't duck the test, I guess you have to use clean or artifical urine. This is not ideal because you either have to:  a) use one of those fake penis things or some shit like that and you're double fucked when you get caught,   or b) you can do reverse catheterization (the ""oil change,"" if you've seen Blue Mountain State), which is gross as hell, has medical risks, and can still give a positive if too many metabolites are excreted b/w the time you put the clean urine into the bladder and the time you pee it out.  I'm sure there's plenty of more sophistication that goes into it than the stuff I've listed, but those are some of the basic ideas that I've heard."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,northernhiro,7,Thu Jul 16 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"This same story keeps getting repeated but does anyone have any first party experience with this?  I don't know any of the top lifters in the CPU that are using and beating the tests.  I'm sure it does happen in some of the eastern european feds since they seem to get popped quite regularly but I have never seen any real evidence that it's ""most"" or ""extremely common"".  The USAPL does a pretty good job of OMT its world team members.  Since neither the USA or Canadian governments do any state sponsoring of powerlifting, I'm not sure where the money is to support the type of doping protocol that would defeat both in and out of meet testing because the meager payouts at the Arnold or getting free protein powder and t-shirts isn't very lucrative."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,northernhiro,4,Thu Jul 16 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"If they do and decide to enter the Arnold, I think they'll be required to complete the Athlete Locator Form and be subject to OMT testing.  It'll be interesting to see if their protocols can beat the OMTs as well as the IMTs.  There are quite a few articles that talk about the benefits from largely undetectable microdosing.  I'm guessing that's going to give less of a boost than full blown unlimited gassing in and out of competition but I guess the anti-doping programs keep somewhat of a lid on the reach of drug-using outliers."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,theNightblade,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"Anywhere that people are depending or testing their athletic performance, there are performance enhancing drugs being used.  It's a plain and simple fact.  Just look at all of the people that have been busted on the Olympic level - they know they will be banned from competition and their careers would be ruined if they were to be caught, but they do it anyway because they want to win so bad.  Legitimate testing protocols are at least a way to keep people scared enough to not use continuously."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,Lou__Tennant,2,Thu Jul 16 05:53:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. Surely the percentage of enhanced lifters in the IPF is less than in many other federations. Not only that, but they are obviously more restricted in what they take, how much they take and when they take it. Obviously you can't be geared to your eyeballs on whatever you want all year round and expect to never be caught. I agree with a lot of what he says, such as the criticism of not using monolifts, but I think he comes across as arrogant and extreme in his views.   ""The fact that anybody supports this federation is disgusting.""   Really? So because I want to compete in a federation where I'm more competitive because there is likely less drug use, I'm disgusting? If every other federation was perfect then maybe then those who compete in the IPF could be criticised, but who wants to compete in federations like the IPA, for example. If the IPF is joke, then what is the IPA?  The IPF will probably never be truly clean, but it's ridiculous to expect it to be. It's almost like saying we shouldn't bother to stop murderers because they will always exist. Of course they'll always exist, but we can try to prevent it from happening as much as possible."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,michael-2-0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"Powerlifting and MMA are pretty much regarded as the two sports where PED'd are the most prevalent, look at the UFC conventional wisdom says at least 60% of the fighters are on a currently banned substance. Now look at the UFC's old drug testing policy its pretty similar to the IPF's current one, the new ufc drug policy is way more strict and you will be able to watch guys deflate in the next year or so."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,allprocro,16,Tue Jul 21 12:57:49 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying I'm not a huge fan of the IPF or the affiliate for the US, USAPL, but I think Blaha is off on a few points.  1) Safety--First, let's be clear, there is one safety difference, and that is no straps/chains on the squat. So the claim ""doesn't give a shit about their lifters"" is pretty suspect. Moreover, the window for what straps/chains would prevent versus a traditional man spotter would, is small. This sport existed for a really long time before straps/chains and very few people were injuries because there were no straps/chains. Brandon Lilly and Mark Bell for example, they blew out knees/hamstrings, having straps or chains there would have done nothing to prevent that.  Also a few years ago Matt Wenning flipped an unbolted down monlift, that sounds pretty unsafe safe to me. So by Blaha's logic if you suport ANY FED that uses an unbolted down monlift (which is every federation) you don't give a shit about lifters safety. If it has happened once, it can happen again.  2) The drug testing creates an illusion argument. Welcome to every sport, ever. Check out weightlifting, there is no sport that embraces the ""illusion"" of being drug free bigger than them. Baseball, football, track, ect all of these sports fail to produce competition that is absent of drugs, but they try just the same way the IPF does. Blaha puts the argument out like the IPF is encouraging drug use. All they are trying to do is do the best job they can. Yes, people beat the tests, yes lots of people in the IPF use drugs, but again, I hope you hate the MLB/NFL cause same shit.  3) Weird politics stuff. I'm not really moved to hate the IPF because they only allow certain knee sleeves, equip. And again, this isn't uncommon in either profession or amatuer sports. College teams sign contracts with Nike, Adidas, ect and can only wear their goods on the field.   4) Blacklisting lifters/no other feds. Valid criticism, this is actually a main reason I'm not a fan of the IPF. I get protecting your brand, but that goes a little too far.  5) Stick up their ass. I mean, straw man. Yeah some lifters are snots about their federation, but some also don't care. The ""leetism"" seems to me to be more just lifters respecting the integrity of the sport. After the shitshow that was the IPA meet and all that fallout do you blame these lifters for wanting to separate themselves from the rest of the sport?   6) The ""everyone else can be friends."" This is just laughable. Ernie LB SR, who is a self-proclaimed ambassador for the sport is online telling people to show up at meets and fight him/that they should suck on his balls. Look at any of the involved parties from the IPA meet, check out their FBs or IGs, and it is a shit storm of shit talk between lifters/feds. The idea that the IPF is the one causing fragmentation in the sport is such a ridiculous claim I can't even.  Like I said I don't particularly care for the IPF, but I also don't really care what they do. I think banning lifters is super stupid, and not good for the sport, but a lot of Blaha's claims are way out there and just trying to generate controversy. I don't bite."

IPF treats it as professional sport when ""everyone"" likes it being an amateur sport. IPF only allows certain pieces of equipment like belts, sleeves etc IPF doesn't like lifters lifting in other feds Essentially says that the IPF places certain restrictions on lifters and compromises their safety in an effort to raise money to conduct ineffective drug testing.

But running comps and testing is not cheap. applying fees to equipment helps out the fed with a bit more money and it can be used somewhat as quality control and for consistency.  Not allowing lifters from other feds to compete in IPF I get why. but its not necessary and it only really creates an illusion that IPF is cleaner.   as to the other points all feds could probably be safer.  who cares how seriously IPF lifters take themselves. if you want to remain amateur that's your own choice and you can choose a fed that's a bit more chill.    personally, I don't really follow IPF that closely. but I really like that they are making the sport more professional. but I'm going to lift where my friends are so thats why Im not going to lift IPF."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,KrytieTV,14,Sun Jul 19 08:44:10 2015 UTC,"No regard of safety to their lifters. No safeties on squats (no monolifts, no chains, no straps). People make points about no safeties for olympic lifters but olympic lifting is not an amateur sport and they don't have to pay their own medical bills when injured. Powerlifting is done for fun and ego, people who do it love lifting and there should be safeties. That alone is enough to boycott IPF. Everyone who supports the IPF doesn't care about lifters. Safeties can't be bought since all their money goes to drug testing. They spent their money on drug-testing to get powerlifting into the olympics, powerlifting has always been an underground sport and people like it that way. Even with 3-10x the budget they have now, they still wouldn't have good drug-testing. Current drug-testing by the IPF does absolutely nothing. Drug-free lifters think they're competing against drug-free lifters, but they're competing against just as much people who are on drugs as they would if they were competing in an untested fed. Anyone who wants to use drugs in the IPF can and will. Drug-testing is a complete waste of money. Money should go into promoting lifters and safeties instead. It's an amateur sport and supposed to be enjoyable. To increase their budget they're now forcing companies to pay them to have IPF-verified equipment. That is the only reason they allow knee wraps in ""RAAAAAAAAAW"" lifting and wrist wraps in ""RAAAAAAAAAAW"" lifting, they add quite a bit to your lift. Only allowed so the IPF earns more money. Lifters have to pay extra for IPF-certified stuff while other brands do the same thing just as well. All money goes to drug-testing instead of safeties. The IPF and IPF lifters keep pushing the idea that they're the most elite and prestigious powerlifting federation. Based on only their opinion, no one in the powerlifting world considers this true. Because IPF restricts in which other federations lifters can lift, people get really competitive, get on drugs and go to the IPF to win in the most prestigious federation. IPF divides powerlifting and create fights inside powerlifting due to not being allowed to hangout with people lifting in other federations, especially untested federations. IPF can ban you for that. His federation allows every lifter. ""What a pile of horseshit, the fact that anybody, anybody supports this federation is disgusting."" More calling it horseshit and disgusting. Doesn't like the way IPF lifters treat lifters in other federations. People in other federations are friends and get along."

I honestly couldn't give a rats ass whether the IPF uses safety stops or chains or whatever on the squat rack. All of that aside, having safeties in place when a lifter fails with 700+ lbs on his back is a hell of a lot better than having to depend on spotters that may be a half second too late. I am of the opinion that if you can implement something that keeps the lifter safe without taking away from any aspect of the lift you should go through with it and making the argument that it shouldn't be is the stupidest fucking thing I've seen on this subreddit to date."

I can find myself in Jason's opinion about safety issues with the IPF. The only issue I have about his opinion is calling the preferences where the IPF spends it's money on ""digusting"", I find this very exaggerated. A federation has the right to spend their money on whatever they want to promote. They have certainly done a good job on promoting themself in that way."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,ape288,8,Wed Jul 15 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"How is ""safety"" coming into this?  If he's talking monos vs racks then that's a pile of bullshit. I've seen more catastrophic accidents and injuries in monos than I have racks and that's because lifters can get more weight on the bar than they can actually support and handle through a squat. At least a walkout lets you adjust to the weight."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,13,Wed Jul 15 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"If you can't walk it out do you really have any business squatting it? All of the IPF lifters I've encountered personally seems to think ""No"". (That being said, mainly scandinavians and monolifts generally arent found here at all.) And if the lifters don't want it, I don't see why the fed should change it either."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,dirtyid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:24 2015 UTC,I've never understood this arguement. Spotters are allowed to help you with the un-rack and walkout in the IPF
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,7,Thu Jul 16 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"I've done one competition where I walked my squats out of a monolift because I've never not walked out a squat and I didn't want to introduce any variables. Still, it was nice to know there were straps under me. In the event of a tendon snapping on the descent, it's nice to know that the barbell that weighs almost 4 times as much as I do is going to fall on the straps.  Let me pose a question to you. I squat all alone in a squat rack with safety pins in my garage. I can bail out of squats like it's my job. No biggie. So would you recommend I, all by myself in my garage, remove the safety pins when I squat? I can clearly evade danger all by myself in any instance where spotters would be able to react. So what's the worst that could happen?"
powerlifting,3dfcvn,dirtyid,2,Thu Jul 16 02:31:32 2015 UTC,"Some feds such as GPC don't even allow you to walk out anymore which I actually think creates more problems than it fixes as I have seen more than enough lifters buckle under the weight as soon as the hooks were pulled up. Plus chains add another variable that can get tangled, etc. Short of a freak accident 3-5 spotters are more than enough to keep you safe.  And you're talking to a guy who squats at home, alone, without safeties here... but in terms of competition the safeties or any frame required to hold them would obscure the views of the refs so aren't feasible."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,5,Thu Jul 16 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Safeties would obscure more than 3-5 spotters? C'mon man, I know you like things old school but ER racks and a pit crew of spotters is not the ultimate solution."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,sergei650,2,Thu Jul 16 03:16:26 2015 UTC,I'm a national level IPF ref... you can see between spotters by moving in your chair. With a big safety bar in the way too this would become far more difficult and at times impossible.   And there doesn't need to be a solution... there isn't a fucking problem!
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BeauBrandon,3,Thu Jul 16 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"My response to you continued abruptly from another message and I should have been more clear, when I say safeties I meant straps or any sort of passive safety system. It feels like you're so attached/used to the IPF setup  because historically it worked OK, that you're opposed or just don't see any need for improvement not just in terms of safety but marketability.   I mean why wouldn't you want to move away from this..."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,Lou__Tennant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"One of the IPF setup's main benefit is that it doesn't obscure the lift much. It's minimal for a reason. If you created some sort of frame (like a mono) to anchor the chains or straps from then this would begin to negate that benefit and furthermore since you could not do away with the spotters then the addition of the straps just add to that problem IMO. And as I said above and elsewhere, there isn't a safety issue, neither myself or any of the IPF lifters I know think they are unsafe.  Also in terms of marketability, as said the mono or any other large frame obscures the lifter more and definitely would not improve the audience experience of powerlifting."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,DrCreeps,2,Thu Jul 16 06:07:39 2015 UTC,Mono's like this would actually improve audience visibility.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,3,Thu Jul 16 17:05:55 2015 UTC,If they hang chains or straps it helps reduce injury.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:27:28 2015 UTC,Monolifts are without a doubt more safe for spotters though. What happens if someone sits too far back and falls over on a 400 kg (~ 900 lbs) plus squat? The spotters would be fucked.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,sergei650,-1,Fri Jul 17 07:53:41 2015 UTC,"ER racks don't have any crash bars. The safety aspect of a monolift is the chains that can catch the bar. Ideally if the venue has a monolift, they should allow it to be used for safety purposes. You can walk out a squat in a monolift."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,3,Thu Jul 16 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that they should be doing everything they can to keep the lifters safe and they are not. Even with monolifts and a team of spotters and safeties injuries do still happen but they help a lot in prevention and in keeping the injuries that do happen from being worse.  I also dislike their policy about people competing in other federations. Powerlifters should not be discouraged from competing, a lot of people just love the sport and want to compete every chance they get."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,DrCreeps,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:48 2015 UTC,I have never seen an injuries that a mono would have stopped. Seriously.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,dirtyid,5,Thu Jul 16 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"I spotted at a USAPL meet where the lifter tore a quad and ditched the bar behind him. The spotter behind him had the bar land on his arms and took him down too. If there were chains from a monolift or a set of crash bars to catch the bar, the spotter wouldn't have been as hurt."
powerlifting,3dfcvn,DrCreeps,4,Thu Jul 16 00:48:03 2015 UTC,Chains and crash bars are set too low to save a spotter. That was pure bad luck and also why the IPF prefers an overhand spot from the back spotter and insists on 2 spotters aside for heavier lifts so that the spotters don't get injured. At least side spotters can get out of the way of a bar dump easier. Monos with chains only stop the bar crushing a lifter on the ground and I really have only seen this happening in monos were lifters haven't walked out their squat.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,dirtyid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:11:04 2015 UTC,Chains and crash bars are set too low to save a spotter.   Then you set them up wrong
powerlifting,3dfcvn,DrCreeps,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:10:48 2015 UTC,So if a bar goes off a guy's back when he's nearly at the top the chains are going to be set high enough to stop the heavy bar from breaking his arms? Because if they were then the lifter wouldn't even be able to squat to depth unless they were IPA :P
powerlifting,3dfcvn,MonstarGaming,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:49 2015 UTC,Me neither. Seen a few fails in a monolift that could have went worse if the bar didn't get caught but if you watch something like Brandon Lilly's accident a monolift wouldn't have made a bit of a difference.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,chuckechaps,5,Thu Jul 16 00:45:26 2015 UTC,... why wouldn't it make a difference?
powerlifting,3dfcvn,TheAesir,0,Thu Jul 16 03:18:13 2015 UTC,His knees gave out before he was low enough for the safeties to catch the bar
powerlifting,3dfcvn,BenchPolkov,5,Thu Jul 16 03:20:16 2015 UTC,His hands were caught on the bar and pretzeled all the way to the ground. Safeties / straps at the right height would have mitigated that. What if he lost it forward? Also didn't one of the spotters get his hand crushed for that dump? I just can't see the reasoning for relying on exclusively on human spotters.
powerlifting,3dfcvn,GeneralMillss,6,Thu Jul 16 03:36:50 2015 UTC,Yeah there's no reason to rely on spotters when the equipment is available

If you define the success of a federation by how widespread and how many athletes participate in a federation, the IPF is the most successful powerlifting federation in the world. I don't think you get to that point by throwing money away.  The IPF is in really the same situation as the Olympics, as far as drug testing goes. Not everyone at the top uses PEDs, but a significant amount assuredly have or are using them. I'm sure both organizations do everything they can to ensure this doesn't happen, but it's a cat and mouse game. Sometimes the cat wins, but the cat is lame and slow and there are a great number of mice."

powerlifting,3dfcvn,TheAesir,19,Wed Jul 15 22:41:14 2015 UTC,The IPF promotes drug-free lifting and punishes those who break the rules. It creates a generally drug-free lifting environment but there will always be cunts who cheat in any sport. There is little more they could possibly do to maintain this so I don't see how you can criticise them for promoting their drug-free competition.

I fucking hate the things personally and I train at a gym that has a few once or twice a week. When I use the monos I throw the chains over the top of the rack and walk that shit out.  So before this fuckstick or anyone else starts telling the IPF how they should be running their fed why not ask the IPF lifters first.

The whole semi sumo crap is terrible advice as it removes the leverage advantages of both conventional and sumo pulling. It increases the difficulty of lockout on sumo, without significantly improving the break. OP would be better served to work on his/her mobility and hip strength"
powerlifting,3detwh,TheAesir,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"I am going to continue to work on hip mobility, but I think hip strength may be the bigger issue. What are your go-to hip strength movements?  Thank you for your thoughts, btw."

It's an improvement.   I don't see why one would go wider if they can lockout with a narrower stance. Narrower gives more floor speed. I've only ever once missed a sumo DL at lockout, other than that, my narrow stance has served me very well."
powerlifting,3detwh,delph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"The whole semi sumo crap is terrible advice as it removes the leverage advantages of both conventional and sumo pulling.   A lot of it is person-specific. Sure, consider that mobility is what's causing the discomfort with a wider stance, but some people are built for certain stances. I don't think you'd be telling Ed Coan to widen his stance and work on mobility. His narrower stance was excellent for his body. I use a narrower stance (although not as narrow as Coan's) and lockout isn't even close to a problem at this point (it wasn't on my conventional, either, fwiw)."
powerlifting,3detwh,TheAesir,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"Coan didn't pull semi Sumo though, and the argument needs to die. Coan was short, and had shorter femurs than most current Sumo pullers. For most of his pulling days, his hips were as open as possible. It wasn't until he needed surgery that he narrowed the stance slightly.  Coan is also an edge case given he's pulled 900lbs in both stances. By widening a conv stance or narrowing a Sumo stance you are removing leverage advantages of that style rather than fixing your weaknesses. Might work in the short term, but its a terrible long term strategy"

By widening a conv stance or narrowing a Sumo stance you are removing leverage advantages of that style rather than fixing your weaknesses. Might work in the short term, but its a terrible long term strategy   Stan Efferding and Eddie Hall pull with a pretty wide conventional stance.

I think you're trying to have a more rule-based prescription than is warranted.   OP isn't an elite lifter, nor is the user I responded too.

Possibly also my body isn't built for a wider stance (see Ed Coan, but I'm not that narrow).

Sorry about your experience, but it looks like you definitely made the best of your conservative attempts! That third squat had a ton of issues, like letting the bar roll up, but you managed to power through it anyway (nice grind!) Bench was a solid drive, and deadlifts looked really clean. You did a good job gauging your lifts to compensate for your less-than-ideal conditions, so kudos!  If you plan on doing another meet this year, I'd suggest doing one of Wes Zunker's meets (Iron Wars in September, Southside Classic in December), or maybe even the Longhorn Open in November.

I get into position and tight before he starts the count down. On 2 I take in air and hold it.  I find this works better for me, as with front squatting, I find it hard to take in a big amount of air while under load."
powerlifting,3d8y41,n3ver3nder88,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"Like any other lift, at least that's my aim. Breathe at the top, inflate the obliques, breathe into your lower back etc, you're still searching for IAB to aid in bracing. I find benching in a belt aids this a lot, ymmv."

powerlifting,3d8y41,MasteronAndCommander,3,Tue Jul 14 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"You can, what you're doing with the 'inflating obliques, breathing into lower back' thing is cueing a solid position with IAB. Once that position is set, you can continue to breathe to inflate the chest to reduce ROM, it's not a one or the other kind of thing.  So what I do, is swing back, under the bar, and sit up between the uprights of the bench, with the bar in front of my chest. In this position I brace and set my position, 'switching on' all my bracing muscles. Holding my breath and that position, I swing through forwards under the bar, post up on my head, then set my traps down and set my feet.   I take a small 'top up' breath whilst I say 'Yes' to my spotter to hand off the bar, then again when I say 'Mine' to receive the bar. After the 'start' command, I take in a big breath, fill my chest for the ROM reduction, and then begin to bench.  Darkside Strength have just done a Q&A vid, there's some talk about setting position with breathing at around the 12 min mark, should be the first video in their timeline. https://www.facebook.com/Darksidestrength?fref=ts"

powerlifting,3d8y41,thewrongflag,5,Tue Jul 14 19:05:13 2015 UTC,Do the meet at your current weight. Then slowly make your way up to the next class by your next meet. There's no sense in filling out with fat and water. You will feel like shit and your potential at the higher weight will be much less than it would if you filled it out with quality mass.

powerlifting,3d8y41,thewrongflag,8,Tue Jul 14 13:07:18 2015 UTC,Also always remember that the bar will sink in more as the weight gets heavier. So what seemed right at the start of the warm-up might be too high for the work sets.
powerlifting,3d8y41,n3ver3nder88,6,Tue Jul 14 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"Additionally, with heavier weight, the bar will bend down at the ends a bit which can also have an effect on unracking and reracking, making it a bit more difficult."

I have a super shitty bar at my house that slides down my back with just 225. The squat bars at my powerlifting gym that are extra thick and have aggressive knurling in every part that touches my back feel like they are cemented on. The bars I use at Gold's Gym are somewhere in between.   I imagine doing some face pulls and lat work before squatting could help thicken your shelf but that won't fix a shitty bar."

So I am pulling stuff off the floor 4 times a week with normal and thicker bars. Will that be enough to improve my pitiful grip?"

You might peruse their FAQ for some grip training information.  In my training, using Fat Gripz during warm up sets on the deadlift helped my grip when it became an issue. I even threw in static holds and a varient of finger curls.  Eventually I dropped the Fat Gripz, static holds, and finger curls, then replaced barbell rows with ""Kroc Rows,"" and my grip strength has gone up much more substantially.  Yes, Fat Gripz are helpful. But there are other ways to work your grip that don't need specialty equipment/accessories beyond typical free-weights."

I feel like I'm setup alright, bar over midfoot and shins (not vertical) touching the bar.   If this isn't normal what are some tips to avoid this?"

powerlifting,3d8y41,MonstarGaming,5,Tue Jul 14 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"OK, stupid question, but just to confirm:  For new lifters, is lifting bodyweight the same ""difficulty"" for everyone, or is it relatively easy for a lighter person compared to heavier lifters? I'm on SL 5x5 LP still, but my BW is a shade under 300 and I feel like I may not make it to 300 5x5 without having to deload and try again a few times, whereas a lighter person would have been 5x5-ing their own weight weeks ago.  So I just basically want to know: do I suck, or is this OK?  Actually, I may have just answered my own question: The ""strength standards"" have the ""Novice"" squat level, reflecting a few months of training, at 205 for a 165lb male, or 1.24xbw. For a 300-lb male it's 265, which I can basically 5x5 right now. So I think I might be ok."

Years of one-legged jumps and weightlifting during puberty. I have more mobility, muscular definition, and coordination on my left side.  I try to focus on equal hip angle. So foot angle, knee rotation, etc that affects how my lower back fires. It looks like I have good form but one side noticeably fires hamstrings through lower back better than the other. Just sitting here it's easier to flex my left lower chain than right.  When I max my left leg/back gets more of a workout. When I tweak something it's always my left side.

powerlifting,3d8y41,fits_data_to_theory,3,Tue Jul 14 17:32:18 2015 UTC,I just did my first 3-week cycle of it and it's the most fun I've had lifting so far.
powerlifting,3d8y41,badgerX3mushroom,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:32 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, what were your lifts going in, and how much experience do you have?"
powerlifting,3d8y41,Thisisnotarealacc123,2,Tue Jul 14 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"I lifted about 3 months prior to starting this program, I lifted very sporadically in the years before so I started from scratch. I just came of SS. I contemplated doing the beginner version he listed but the Full body Full boring version seemed most fun.  I came in with 5 rep maxes of 90kg on the squat, 65kg on the bench and 115kg on the deadlift. These became my 10, 12 and 10 rep maxes respectively."
powerlifting,3d8y41,badgerX3mushroom,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:30 2015 UTC,Let's do it. I finish my cut right before that.
powerlifting,3d8y41,Thisisnotarealacc123,10,Tue Jul 14 18:55:01 2015 UTC,5/3/1 is pretty good. You can add joker sets and pyramid down sets for extra volume.
powerlifting,3d8y41,badgerX3mushroom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:51:56 2015 UTC,"As my dumbass question, could you explain jokers and pyramid?"
powerlifting,3d8y41,Thisisnotarealacc123,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:32 2015 UTC,"Pyramid example for 3/3/3+ day:  70% for 3, 80% for 3, 90% for 3+, 80% for 3+, 70% for 3+.    On the way down you can rep out both 80% and 70% or just hit 3 reps at 80% and rep out the 70%.  There are other down set options discussed in the books, sets across, first set last, and rest-pause.  Up to you, just get some extra volume in.  Joker Sets example:  70% for 3, 80% for 3, 90% for 3+, Feeling good so joker sets (You wouldn't do this every time out!), 95% for 3, 100% for 3, 105% for 3, won't get 110% so stop here.  You can work up with the reps of the day, 5 reps on 5s day, 3 reps on 3s day, 1 rep on 5/3/1 day, or you can go all out, or you can just hit heavy singles on your way up.  It's a concept which requires you to think about it a little bit, and be honest about your capabilities, but it sure isn't complicated.   After joker sets do extra volume with some down sets, either pyramid or first set last, or sets across, or rest-pause."
powerlifting,3d8y41,theNightblade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"Joker is you add 5% and then try to complete the same number of reps for your current week requires. I usually do this for 1 to 2 sets. DO NOT do joker sets if you wont be able to complete the required number of reps. Its a way to add some autoregullation in your programming. If you feel good, then push yourself, if not, then do no joker sets.  Pyramid down is going back down the same you went up. I only do the first two sets and the last set as an amrap.  so for 5/5/5+ day I usually do 5x65%, 5x75%, 5+x85%, 5x90%, 5x75%, 5+x65%"
powerlifting,3d8y41,Thisisnotarealacc123,3,Tue Jul 14 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Juggernaut Method imho. Four 4-week mesocycles periodized with accumulation, intensification, realization, and deload weeks going from high volume (sets of 10) in the first mesocycle to high intensity (sets of 3) in the fourth mesocycle with a progressive overload scheme based on your performance in the realization phase of each mesocycle.  To summarize the effectiveness of JM for me, I did my first macrocycle on a fairly aggressive cut utilizing Westside for skinny bastards for my accessory lifts and my bench went from a 275 lb 1RM to 275 lbs for three reps and squat went from 420 lbs to 450 lbs. Trying it now on a caloric surplus."
powerlifting,3d8y41,theNightblade,2,Tue Jul 14 22:27:36 2015 UTC,why are you fed up by greyskull? I just started it
powerlifting,3d8y41,Thisisnotarealacc123,2,Tue Jul 14 22:43:51 2015 UTC,I'm doing it for quite some time now. The gainz are amazing but I really need to cut or at least turn down the caloric surplus and squats are exhauuusting
powerlifting,3d8y41,theNightblade,3,Tue Jul 14 22:56:39 2015 UTC,3x5 squats are exhausting?
powerlifting,3d8y41,kevler9oh,2,Wed Jul 15 15:23:29 2015 UTC,2x5; 1x5+ and two or three backoff sets.
powerlifting,3d8y41,TheAesir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:58:19 2015 UTC,oh I haven't been doing backoff sets. hrm.
powerlifting,3d8y41,needlzor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:56 2015 UTC,I just figured I needed a bit more volume. Even though I'm only at 145 kg for the working sets
powerlifting,3d8y41,TheAesir,2,Tue Jul 14 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"Seconding 5/3/1.  You can set up to do bench/ohp 2 days a week, and squat/deadlift 2 days a week.  I ran it for about a year that way with the boring but big accessory work and did well for me at your level (I'm barely past intermediate level now IMO)"
powerlifting,3d8y41,jonlwowski012,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:13:21 2015 UTC,Isnt it too advanced? If I compare Texas Method progress (10 kg each month) to 10 kg each 7 weeks on 531 on sq and DL and 5 on bench it seems very slow. Also i dont really like doing bench or squat only once a week since i get out of groove pretty fast
powerlifting,3d8y41,Dreadlifts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"10kg every 7 weeks?  No, 10lbs every 4 is a typical progression for lower on 5/3/1.  It's slower but it's supposed to be, since it's not a linear progression but a weekly undulating periodization program with a monthly linear progression.  You can do a 4 day split and bench and squat 2 days each week.  I'd recommend reading the book, it's cheap and will give you a much better idea of what to expect.  I doubt 5/3/1 is too advanced for you but if you want faster linear progression then you should stick with Texas method honestly."
powerlifting,3d8y41,MonkeyMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"i read the book months ago and it says 2 training cycles and then deload, which equals 7 weeks."
powerlifting,3d8y41,NOREGRETSLOL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"You don't really have to deload in the beginner phase of it unless you start missing lift numbers.  I don't think I deloaded for like 3 months the first time through.  Is it recommended?  Sure, but you should have a good idea when you need to deload too."
powerlifting,3d8y41,barpywasblow,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"5/3/1 was my stepping stone into strength training and it really kicks ass, if you're relatively low on most of your numbers, skip every other deload week unless you feel you absolutely need it."
powerlifting,3d8y41,NOREGRETSLOL,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"531's progression is going to be really slow particularly for an intermediate. I'd go so far as to say get on one of the 4 day sheiko programs, or run the 4 day TM programming. More volume is a good thing"
powerlifting,3d8y41,barpywasblow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Candito's weekly progression is 4 days a week, but I don't know how well it is appreciated in this sub."
powerlifting,3d8y41,OmnipotentStudent,5,Tue Jul 14 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"but I don't know how well it is appreciated in this sub.   Everything Candito, including his program, is circlejerked in this sub. Its currently one of the most frequently asked about programs"
powerlifting,3d8y41,James72090,2,Tue Jul 14 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"Improving up back rounding on the deadlift, how do you accomplish this? I know it is acceptable to round but I feel my lockout is so much weaker when I found."
powerlifting,3d8y41,NOREGRETSLOL,4,Tue Jul 14 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be increasing volume or frequency, so you can get more practice hammering in good form. It could be as simple as improving your setup and technique"
powerlifting,3d8y41,BellaFiat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:36:26 2015 UTC,I believe that snatch grip deadlifts are a good assistance exercise to help with that. source
powerlifting,3d8y41,FatbutSwole,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:52 2015 UTC,What happens if I accidentally miss my weight class but by weighing too little. Like I sign up for the 198 class but weigh in 178?
powerlifting,3d8y41,kawayylmao,6,Tue Jul 14 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've read it depends on the federation, but you'll most likely complete in the lighter class. There were some cases where its an unfair advantage to be lighter in a heavier class."
powerlifting,3d8y41,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:31:03 2015 UTC,It's IPA rules (inb4 IPA) but affiliated fund raising. And I'm weak so I doubt it really matters.
powerlifting,3d8y41,kawayylmao,6,Tue Jul 14 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'm around 300 pounds at the moment, so if I showed up and made into a lighter weight class I'd feel like I already won the day."
powerlifting,3d8y41,Danny_Lugo,2,Tue Jul 14 14:54:09 2015 UTC,You'll get to lift in whatever weight class you feel like! Just like the lilliebridges! ;)  It's probably similar to IPF rules where you can lift in any weightclass you happen to weigh in at. Unless it's a national or higher level.
powerlifting,3d8y41,Mattman-95,2,Tue Jul 14 15:23:15 2015 UTC,Get that power bloat and eat like mad the day before then a solid breakfast a few hours before your meet.
powerlifting,3d8y41,TheSecondOP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:01 2015 UTC,That's always an option. I'd fill out the 198 class leading up to the meat but like I have nice work clothes that I need to fit so a dreamers bulk isn't gunna work.
powerlifting,3d8y41,jamesmechanikong,2,Tue Jul 14 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"I am doing Wendler 531 Blood and Chalk.  I've been through one cycle, and while I enjoy it, it's a different mindset going from sets of 6-8 reps on assistance work to 12 reps.  I find that I can't get the right amount of weight to finish out the set.  However, if I drop the weight, it becomes too easy.  Is it better attempt but maybe fail before 12 reps at a higher weight or drop the weight and get the full 12, even though it feels easy?       Sorry if this is a major dumbass question."
powerlifting,3d8y41,jamesmechanikong,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"Drop the weight ant get full 12, but in the beginning AMRAP your last set. Depending on the amount of extra reps you do, increase the weight until you are completely challenging yourself."
powerlifting,3d8y41,maranmaran,2,Tue Jul 14 15:55:36 2015 UTC,... How do I not let the air out when I brace my Abs? I kind of can't keep my mouth/neck closed somehow as soon as I start pulling. The pressure is just too much.  Could that be due to the fact that I took a break from squatting and deadlifting or is my technique just wrong.
powerlifting,3d8y41,mazze01,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:35 2015 UTC,Give it a week. Still not working and try a mouth guard. Bite down hard and it's hard for air to come out.
powerlifting,3d8y41,TheHy-Mag,2,Tue Jul 14 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, I still have one from kickboxing lol. Will try it out,thanks"
powerlifting,3d8y41,drayeseez,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Thinking about doing Sheiko for my next program. Does anyone have the app, and is it worth the $13?"
powerlifting,3d8y41,RageLettuceTurbo,2,Wed Jul 15 05:35:06 2015 UTC,The app is great. It effectively gives you progression from a beginner to an advanced lifter with 3 different loading levels. I'm not going to say that I paid for it (I got a free beta version) or that I use it (I'm a bit beyond the level of the programming) but its a great resource that you can take with you wherever you train.
powerlifting,3d8y41,drayeseez,2,Tue Jul 14 16:45:58 2015 UTC,Anyone have any tips on where to start % wise for sumo block pulls? Looking to add them into my programming in place of sumos from the floor. I want to work my lockout a little harder and get a bit of variation for a few weeks.
powerlifting,3d8y41,RageLettuceTurbo,2,Tue Jul 14 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"I've been running Texas Method for a while now and getting good results for squat and bench, but deadlift is definitely not progressing. I'm trialling a Mag-Ort day but wondering if the progression is too slow for an intermediate lifter? Would I be better off doing a sperate 5*5 deadlift day instead? Lifts are 210/120/250 @ 105 kg if that helps"
powerlifting,3d8y41,RageLettuceTurbo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:40 2015 UTC,Are those lifts kilos or pounds? If pounds i would examine technique and stay on TM for awhile. Where/how are you failing the lift? If in kilos I think mag/ort on its own day woulf be good. Its done wonders for my DL which is the only lift really progressing at a good rate(10lbs a month) for me right now.
powerlifting,3d8y41,everphilski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:38 2015 UTC,Sorry I reread your post and it is pretty obvious you are talking in kilos. I think mag-ort is great and the progress can be plenty fast. I just keep upping the weight rather than maxing out if i hit my reps. You can test your max on meet day!
powerlifting,3d8y41,xlino,2,Tue Jul 14 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"What am I to do with my deadlift, kinda average-longish femur short arms my lockout is very close to hips while my friends is just above knees, conv feels very wierd to setup, wide sumo also and is too hard on hips and practically impossible for me to break the bar off the ground, tried semi sumo recently pulled +3 rep pr and +10kg volume pr but still feels very fucked here's the semi sumo volume pr https://youtu.be/MGEEBCtJNBY  And here's conv https://youtu.be/LNr831uuDdw  Both are 5th or 4th set of 5x5 but sumo is after 12 sets of squats and conv was the first movement (to keep in mind when watching speed or something)  And could someone gimme tips how to program deadlifting into my workouts I'm currently pull push lega rest upper lower rest  Tons of volume, I'm getting about 22k+ lbs from just squats and tons from pushing and upper back pull movements also  Just in case you need it I'm 5'9 155 lbs sq is around 290-315 bench about 235-240 and deadlift probably 330-350"

powerlifting,3d9rpa,DanceSex,6,Tue Jul 14 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say the most popular wraps we see in the USAPL these from each brand are the Sig Golds, Grippers, and Metal Silvers  Wish any of those had been covered.  I like THPs but they aren't the favorite now and Z's certainly are last decade's inzer wrap.  I get it though that wraps are super expensive and you have to pick the ones you want to review."

powerlifting,3d9rpa,PerfectNemesis,8,Wed Jul 15 01:49:47 2015 UTC,I'm going to piggie back on this post especially since you basically reaffirmed what I've been saying about the Powerbelly death rows. They're a great wrap that give me a ton of carry over and I've used about 10 different wraps over the years. If anyone that watches this decides to go with anything Powerbelly DISBROW15 saves you 15%.   I may have to do a video covering most of the different Powerbelly wraps now that I have pretty much all of them.
powerlifting,3d9rpa,Mdisbrow,2,Tue Jul 14 17:51:18 2015 UTC,Please do. I have Titan THPs and PB death rows. They are polar opposites. I wish I would have gotten the DRs in 3m though. 2.5m only gets me 4 or 5 revolutions when I'm wrapping myself. My training partner can get 6 maybe 7 if they really crank them down.   I'd love to see a your review of the DRs and the ones that are a mix of the death row and orange ones. I forget the names.
powerlifting,3d9rpa,Meat_Daddy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:37 2015 UTC,I would definitely appreciate a video on the different wraps PB offers. My Inzer Grippers are falling apart and I'm not particularly fond of the slingshot wraps.

powerlifting,3d7oo0,Benxbec,73,Tue Jul 14 03:58:39 2015 UTC,This is really something. This could be a real turning point in powerlifting. A notoriously suspect federation actually admitted that the lifting isn't to a high enough standard. Yell loud enough and you will be heard.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,badgerX3mushroom,32,Tue Jul 14 04:02:20 2015 UTC,"Revoking this meet gives IPA more legitimacy. If they had let these pass, IPA would never be respected by the PL community. It was a good call on their part for the longevity and future of their federation."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,gunch,9,Tue Jul 14 05:44:46 2015 UTC,I think it helped that PL watch was having a user referendum on whether to count the records set at this meet or not.  They're not a governing body but they are the go-to site to see who holds what record in what weight class and classification.  Better to void your own meet than have a third party do it de facto for you.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,badgerX3mushroom,5,Tue Jul 14 14:53:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, without PL watch I don't think they would've revoked even with all the videos and outrage and other big squatters speaking out about it."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,Lobsterzilla,9,Tue Jul 14 12:45:43 2015 UTC,I didn't get a screenshot but basically he's got a vid of Kendall doing a real paused bench press and saying that he's a hypocrite because he's lifted in the IPA.    I haven't seen any of Kendall's lifts that haven't been to standard passed that I can remember.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,theNightblade,7,Tue Jul 14 12:48:03 2015 UTC,the problem he had with DK's bench was his ass visably came off the bench and was passed in the exact same IPA meet held last year.  He also felt the DK bench had a shorter pause.  dont agree but thats what lillibridge thought
powerlifting,3d7oo0,tapdancingintomordor,6,Tue Jul 14 13:12:02 2015 UTC,at least it was a real pause and no one was touching the weights the whole time.  DKs butt may have lifted but we all know how hard it is to keep your butt down when you're really grinding one out.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,theNightblade,7,Tue Jul 14 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"I actually thought the press command came very early in the DK video, almost before the bar touched the chest, but he still paused it. Not a long pause, but definitely not TnG like in the video from the meet this weekend."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,tapdancingintomordor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:24 2015 UTC,"Most feds give a press command when the bar is stopped on the chest. So a controlled decent, generally leads to a quicker press command. Not sure if that's the case in DK's case however"
powerlifting,3d7oo0,A_Meat_Popsicle,3,Tue Jul 14 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Found the lift on YouTube. It's a controlled decent, especially for a 617 lbs lift, but the press command comes very early."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,jaskydesign,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:17 2015 UTC,"The command here and at the meet this weekend sucked, but I'm more willing to cut the bench judges some slack after hearing about how nervous Ed Coan was to judge Spoto's WR bench. It doesn't excuse what happened by any means, but I can at least understand why a guy would get nervous about screwing over somebody going for a big lift or record and jump the gun on the command."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,TheAesir,4,Tue Jul 14 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, corrected the typo. Still haven't had enough caffeine yet.  /u/mdisbrow could probably explain it better than I can, but as far as I know Dan Dague is the president of both RPS and XPC. The XPC events have fairly high qualifiers (as in 8 lifters in the 205's at IPF worlds wouldn't have qualified for the XPC Arnold's event). They've since partnered with UPA, and currently allow USPA to hold a few qualifying events. They have also partnered in the past with APF.  Really the only significant difference between most of the XPC feds and USPA is that raw lifters user the monolifts just like the geared guys. Other than that, they have strict judging, use specialty bars (typically mastodon squat bars and a deadlift bar), and allow knee wraps just like USPA does."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,sharpwqt232,4,Tue Jul 14 14:32:23 2015 UTC,The XPC events have fairly high qualifiers (as in 8 lifters in the 205's at IPF worlds wouldn't have qualified for the XPC Arnold's event).   Can you compare an untested fed's qualifiers to a tested fed's?
powerlifting,3d7oo0,TheAesir,6,Tue Jul 14 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"Im not going to compare the XPC to untested feds but I will compare them to another fed I've competed in the USPA. I'm going to put two links at the bottom of this post. The first will be to the USPA qualifying totals, the second the XPC qualifying totals. I'm going to use the raw totals for the 275 weight class as an example. Now in the USPA you must have a class 2 total in order to qualifying for national meets. In the XPC there is only elite and pro totals, you must get an elite total to qualify for the Arnold. So if you look at those numbers the USPA requires a 1270lb total vs 1700lbs in the XPC. That's a pretty huge difference between the two and the pro totals in the XPC are even higher. I've always looked at the XPC totals like this, elite makes you an extremely gifted natural lifter, pro makes you world class as a natural lifter. Hope that all makes sense and helps some.  https://m.facebook.com/USPA.Powerlifting/posts/525092060869107  http://www.xpcpowerlifting.com/qualify/totals/"
powerlifting,3d7oo0,sharpwqt232,2,Tue Jul 14 16:23:15 2015 UTC,class one this year for USPA nationals.  master class for IPL worlds.   but the XPC was always designed to be a champion's championship vs. your normal local/nationals/world federation. so its really apples and oranges.   UPA and RPS are the equivalent to the USPA in relation to XPC.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,TheAesir,2,Tue Jul 14 17:30:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just going off what had previously been the qualifiers. I haven't competed in the uspa for over a year. That being said the qualifiers are still higher in the XPC. You're right though XPC is meant to be a best of the best type meet. I feel with the recent changes made to RUM we may see the XPC start living up to that.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,Mdisbrow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"RPS elite (pro) at 275 is 1655 and UPA elite is 1684. Even the 'Master' total, which would be the equivalent of class 2 in RPS is 1520, which is significantly higher than the equivalent USPA qualifying total."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,TheAesir,3,Tue Jul 14 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's not like the qualifier is that outrageous. For the aforementioned weight class (90kg or 198lbs) the qualifying total is 1520, which is only a 440 wilks. There were lifters in that class at IPF worlds that were sub 400."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,Mdisbrow,3,Tue Jul 14 15:17:43 2015 UTC,Isn't the XPC Arnolds a classic event though with knee wraps? There is no classic raw in the IPF making it a bit unfair to compare the two.
powerlifting,3d7oo0,theNightblade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"Realistically knee wraps aren't going to make the difference between the 400 USAPL qualifier and the 440 XPC qualifier. The difference for 198 is 140lbs. Point being, there were lifters in that class at worlds that wouldn't have been able to lift at the Arnold's in USAPL."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,PerfectNemesis,5,Tue Jul 14 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"Having competed in both uspa and XPC/RPS I prefer the XPC/RPS. The equipment is better (if you want to walk your squat out of the mono go for it, but they should be used as they're much safer), it's a more lifter friendly organization, and generally has a better atmosphere. I can also tell you at least the meets Lexen holds there are no favorites. Dan will not judge his own lifters and has guys from Detroit barbell judge us. The one time he did judge one of my squats he red lighted me and said ""it has to be deeper, I can't look like I'm picking favorites"". So if anything we get judged more ridgidly than others."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,TheAesir,2,Tue Jul 14 17:05:55 2015 UTC,I was sold on the RPS judging after my second meet at Lexen in which they red lighted one of Caitlin Trout's attempts (which I believe was some kind of national record)

Chuck the safety straps on (they held Bell's 1080lb, they are truck tow straps ffs) get rid of the 6 spotters (gives judges a clearer view anyway), and stick on on a tripod in front of the head judge's chair and one directly to the side of the lifter). Put rules in place so it doesn't slow a meet down even more (maybe the lifter can only have one appeal, or appeal a world record or to prevent bombing out) or simply just for disputes later. At local meets, who cares, but at nationals and world level meets having the ability to prove a lift will be a great improvement. And surely guy's like the Lilliebridge's get sick of having to call everyone haters. Everyone wins. Other lifters get legitimate records to compete against, the lifter gets to prove his record and the judges have a fall back."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,frak8757,8,Tue Jul 14 06:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, an appeals system is precisely the way to go. You get unlimited correct appeals, and one or two incorrect ones. This is the method every other sport has adopted using new technologies."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,E4TclenTrenHardr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"Making it fast enough would be key, TMO always takes ages looking at the angles. Maybe on of the scorers or similar can do the review and if it's ambiguous take it to the head judge."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,E4TclenTrenHardr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"The meet can continue while the previous lifter's appeal is reviewed by someone else, perhaps a scorer like you said. And then the result announced after the following lift. Boom money."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,Tobbec17,7,Tue Jul 14 16:46:48 2015 UTC,it'd be nice. was talking with some sponsors and sponsored lifters this weekend about what it would take...one can hope.  or one can win the powerball and set up a trust...
powerlifting,3d7oo0,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"It will never happen unfortunately. It may be able to be nearly what we want if all legitimate sponsors only sponsor lifters in those feds, but some guys will always want to go elsewhere because they can't handle being judged to the correct standard."

powerlifting,3d7oo0,Daveuall,2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of feds that are doing their thing and running great meets without making negative waves.  ADFPF is one of them.  Only thing about them is they don't allow sleeves or wraps raw.  So in that regard, USAPL has an upper hand in terms of raw lifting, imo."
powerlifting,3d7oo0,OmnipotentStudent,15,Wed Jul 15 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"I know that the USAPL/IPF have testing to become a state, national and international judge. Basically after passing the test to become a state judge, you have to judge a certain amount of meets before you can become a national judge and same goes for national to international. They are very strict on who makes the cut and for a World Record to be set there must be international judges from three different countries to ensure that you aren't given whites just because you know the judges or they are trying to help their countrymen.  The IPA on the other hand, I have no clue how they select judges but clearly they aren't doing it right."

powerlifting,3d8vou,delph,2,Wed Jul 15 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"So Blaine should call him out. Or they should incognito compete as ""The Vanilla Gorilla,"" so they get Blaine's S/D and Spoto's bench. WR nickname total by a mile."

powerlifting,3d92p0,DrColossus1,4,Tue Jul 14 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the thread in question. but it doesn't really provide much in the way of advice.  What I'll say for now is just be clear (and realistic) about your goals and offer concise feedback periodically during the session. Don't interrupt too much if you care at all about relaxation.  Speaking of which, relax during the session. Consciously try to be as soft as possible. Don't push back against the therapist. If you feel yourself tightening up, take a deep breath and try to relax. Ask the therapist to pause for a moment if you need.  I'll try to revisit this thread after work today to answer questions and provide more info if I can."

powerlifting,3d92p0,MonstarGaming,3,Tue Jul 14 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"My therapist is a remedial/sports massage therapist so she's seen it all and knows her shit. I go in tell her where it hurts and she does the rest. For example I had severe hip /groin pain, went in and told her my hip hurt and where. She brutalized my quads and that's what fixed the pain. So she didn't even touch the thing I would have told her to work on. Basically- tell them where it hurts and how, let them do their work. Prepare for maximum stiffness and pain over the next couple of days- DO NOT TRAIN the area work straight after, and go light for a day or two. It will get worse before it gets better.   Also- finding a good one: word of mouth"
powerlifting,3d92p0,ThatOldStuff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:54:46 2015 UTC,do you think it would be a good idea to get a massage a week before a meet?
powerlifting,3d92p0,PassthatVersayzee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:23:53 2015 UTC,I think that would be a very bad idea. Two weeks out minimum to give your body time to get back together.
powerlifting,3d92p0,ThatOldStuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:34 2015 UTC,What's the issue? Getting rid of elasticity? Or just pain from the massage?
powerlifting,3d92p0,PassthatVersayzee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:06 2015 UTC,"For two weeks or more after your first deep tissue massage you may have a hard time lifting. I don't know the science of it, but I see it like this- it works to release tension and knots and this results is the relaxation of the muscles at which point it feels like they completely forget what they're supposed to do. Everything is looser so it changes the way you lift and it super hard to get tight and stay tight. Basically your body needs the time to regain some tension and remember how to lift again. For three weeks after my first deep tissue my squats were absolute shit cos she released my quads and hips and I felt like I had to learn to squat all over again. The more you get treated the better your recover, but until you know how your body reacts to this stuff, don't risk it. Keep this kind of stuff to two weeks out or more :)"
powerlifting,3d92p0,ThatOldStuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"Good advice, thanks for the tip"
powerlifting,3d92p0,PassthatVersayzee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:56 2015 UTC,"On your half, hydrate like crazy, both before and after. Second, sodium intake should be decent, because you will feel totally drained the next day. Stretch, or go for a walk if you are getting lower body or back work done to get the blood flowing. Trust me if you just sit still for the day, the next day will be agony and you will be completely cramped back up. Also some icy hot or Equiblock to keep the body loosened. From what I have tried over the years, this seems to be the best bet for me personally. As far as the therapist goes you will just need to try them out to see if they are worth the time and money, if you tell them what you want to focus on and they start doing other shit you didnt ask, then they usually are a cookie cutter therapist. But if you tell them what is bothering you and they focus on that then they are usually pretty good. Oh and just cause they say they say they focus on athletes does not mean they are good, learned that one the hard way."

powerlifting,3d6a3y,sdre,57,Tue Jul 14 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. My thoughts are sort of in two parts.    I know and accept that powerlifting as a sport is pretty frivolous and continue it mostly as a hobby. At this point I'm too old to be in the olympics should it ever get accepted. And outside of that specific venue powerlifting as a sport will remain basically how it is now. The big competitions now will continue to remain big and big names will continue to cycle through them.  However, with that being said. People value this sport. It has meaning to a great many lifters out there across the world. To have these lifts be accepted in any powerlifting platform, anywhere, is absolutely shitting on people who genuinely give a fuck about the sport. If people care about the sport, as seriously as the Lillibridge family says they do, then they would take action to further legitimatize the non-IPF lifters and feds. But by holding their own personal meets, under situations that appear shady, and to have lifts be granted which are clearly bad... does nothing but push this branch of powerlifting further away from the masses and make the entire lifting community look like clowns."

Just one of the many reasons why I value your thoughts more than ""how many elite meets have you accomplished etc"" is because you have helped many others not only by inspiring others to get better (through your gzcl program) but you are honestly passionate about powerlifting. You want it to get better.  Sure, you may not have broken WR or be a powerhouse lifter. But you will always be someone I look up to.   Edit: holy shit you are an insane lifter, but just not like you know.. dan green kinda powerhouse :3"
powerlifting,3d6a3y,sdre,18,Tue Jul 14 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. Happy to provide them. That is, until I start getting an influx of hatermail. But whatever, that's not new.   You know, it's not that I care about powerlifting specifically. I care more about people getting stronger physically because I have seen such a huge improvement in myself because of my pursuit of strength. If I can share that, and get others to start making it part of their lives too, then it's just one small piece of good I've contributed to the world in making it a better whole. My physical strength has given me more than a pretty good powerlifting total- it's given me a whole new life. It has positively infected other aspects of my life I had never imagined.   And for that, I'm eternally grateful of the barbell.   I'm also grateful that you, and others, value my thoughts as a lifter, especially considering how I'm not Dan Green level ;) Although, I am trying... just like, a bazillion more wilks points to go. cries  It's just a shame that somewhere a kid will see this and quit lifting early in their lives out of disappointment and they'll never experience the joy I have in lifting weights."
powerlifting,3d6a3y,gzcl,8,Tue Jul 14 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"The true heart of powerlifting is enjoying the process, and helping others get better.  It's not just about how much weight you can move - everyone has their own story in that regard.  Yeah, we're all competitive, but it's not doing me any good to stress over why my total doesn't even compete with the better lifters in my federation at my weight class.  Yes, I want to win, but my end goal on the platform is testing myself.  If I just wanted to beat other people I wouldn't have picked a strength sport.  Whether you're someone like me who are just getting started when most people are retiring from the sport, an old grinder who's been at it for decades, or a young up and comer killing it in juniors who's been lifting since 7th grade, anyone can do the lifts.  Anyone can put a total out there, but most people don't have the dedication or the desire to share their experiences and knowledge, in hopes that it can help someone else better their lives too.  I have a lot of respect for people who have been at this long enough to know something, and are more than willing to share.  That's why I'm such a huge fan of Mark Bell and the Supertraining crew, as well as Burdick, Efferding, Matt Vincent, /u/Mdisbrow (and yes, even you, /u/gzcl!)...I'm just getting to the point where I now am starting to realize everything I don't know about the sport and training (which is a lot).  And one day I hope I can be one of those people that can give back to the sport in the right way, share what I know and help someone improve at either life or lifting."

This is not a reflection on the IPA. This was one meet that unfortunately was run like a shit show. This behavior and unprofessionalism is not accepted by the IPA in any manner.

They need to be set straight because its an embarrassment to every lifter, not just the ones involved, and it belittles everyone else's accomplishments by making the sport as a whole look like a joke to those outside of it.  There are standards that need to be adhered to. The rules for squat depth and pause duration are written EXACTLY the same in every federation and it's time they start being enforced the way they are written across the board. Otherwise, the sport will simply begin to fizzle away, and rightly so."

Great look though, have you thought about doing any bodybuilding comps?  Also, did you bulk with a weight goal in mind or were you going for strength?"
powerlifting,3d566w,jeffblue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"I have never done any training for appearance I have been 100% focused on strength since i started 3 1/2 years ago.  I definitely have a bunch of lagging bodyparts if I ever wanted to do a bodybuilding show such as my biceps.  My arms are barely 16"" because I never do bicep work, not even chin ups or anything like that.   My best strength I think is, I do have pretty good back width and thickness, you can kind of see it here, I was trying to show the aftermath of a high volume squat session, but it shows my upper back and lat development pretty well.  https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/10845717_10100108310901202_5329649538819781994_o.jpg  As far as bodybuilding show, don't think its in the cards for me, I enjoy the strength aspect too much to divide my focus.  I never really ""bulked"" persay, I just eat when I'm hungry and try to focus on carbs to fuel my workouts, the rest just happened on its own.  If i get too chubby I cut back a little for a month or 2 then go back to my normal eating.  Eating this way my body tends to hover in the 193-200 range."

powerlifting,3d6mbt,Lou__Tennant,3,Tue Jul 14 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"The guy doing my lift off was strange. During the first attempt, I set up and nodded when I was in place. He stepped up, I made eye contact and nodded again and he gave me the lift off. The second time, however, he didn't move when I nodded that I was ready. He then said ""on the count of three,"" but didn't start counting. So I counted to three and finally got the lift off. Then on the third attempt, he stepped up and he counted to three. So there was no consistency in how I was getting the lift off, which was strange. But I digress.    It sounds like he had to lift off to a lot of people... he probably got scolded by another lifter or something and switched his game up, or was just completely exhausted by that point.  When I'm spotting/loading I virtually never remember what a particular lifter does/looks like/is named/wants"

powerlifting,3d6ex3,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,5,Tue Jul 14 00:40:27 2015 UTC,That happens with any stiff wraps occasionally. The velcro straps end up taking far more tension than they would on stretchy wraps.

powerlifting,3d6ex3,NikhilT90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:19:28 2015 UTC,I have a pair of the flexible 60cm wraps and I can't get a good cast with them. How are the stiff wraps compared to Titan Sig Golds?
powerlifting,3d6ex3,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:56:40 2015 UTC,Stiff as fuck and the velcro looks better stitched and like it will last longer than on Metal Silvers. Golds stretch out over time but the SBD stiffs have far less give in them so they should last longer.
powerlifting,3d6ex3,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:34 2015 UTC,Interesting. Might have to pick up a pair. Since they're stiffer I should be able to get away with a shorter pair right? I usually use the 30inch sig golds. Maybe I'll try the 60cm (~24 inches) stiff SBDs. Thanks!
powerlifting,3d6ex3,powerliftinglife,2,Tue Jul 14 11:34:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I used to use long golds too but I've been quite happy with the 24in stiffs.
powerlifting,3d6ex3,BenchPolkov,3,Tue Jul 14 12:00:32 2015 UTC,They are a good fit but the stitching at the back of mine is starting to go after less than 4 months so I'm not so happy anymore.

powerlifting,3d6ex3,interrogatories,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:35 2015 UTC,I've never heard of MB and have seen but never used rehbands. All I can say is that SBD have set the benchmark with sleeves and Titan offer a comparable (if dodgier quality at the moment) but easier to use product.
powerlifting,3d6ex3,JosephusBroz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"I use them, as Polkov mentioned some stitching is starting to come undone with less than 5 months of now. First pair of sleeves, so im not to sure what to reference but my knees feel nice and warm."
powerlifting,3d6ex3,Isilrac23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:03:37 2015 UTC,That's interesting. The first batch of their original knee sleeves they put out back in... 2011 (I think?) had terrible problems with the stitching blowing out. Pretty much everyone I knew who got them early blew them out within 6 months. They apparently fixed the problem but it's a bit disappointing if they've managed to do it again with another new product.

After 32 (meet or mock meet), many lifters will fall back and run 37 over and over until it's time for 32 again.  I am currently running the Class 1 and CMS 4 day program myself and am in the last month."
powerlifting,3d6pr0,BenchPolkov,3,Mon Jul 13 23:36:50 2015 UTC,Before Sheiko was GZCL and fuckarounditis. I have one more week of #31 before the last four weeks that are #32. Depending on how I do after Sheiko is done I might do another program completely before returning to a four day Sheiko program.
powerlifting,3d6pr0,theNightblade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:50:34 2015 UTC,Typically its recommended to run them 29->32 and then if sticking with the programs sub 29 for 37. From a larger macro template it makes more sense than to run them in the order you suggested.
powerlifting,3d6pr0,theNightblade,3,Tue Jul 14 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Dump #29 altogether unless you've had an extended lay off or need a small deload. #37 can be repeated to accumulate extra fatigue as #30-31 get higher in intensity and are better to finish with. Overall however switching to the 4 day cycles is better of time permits as they are better balanced.
powerlifting,3d6pr0,theNightblade,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:51 2015 UTC,I can say that after sheiko moving to a program with less volume in any way will be too easy.  I agree with Polkov that you just keep trucking along with different variants of his programs.  I'll be back on Sheiko methods to prepare for my November meet soon enough.  I've been running a lower volume program simply to work on beltless strength and chasing that hyper trophy while increasing work capacity.
powerlifting,3d6pr0,krakino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:02:48 2015 UTC,That's the biggest reason why moving away from Sheiko would screw me over. I'd lose work capacity and I'd jump back onto a Sheiko program and have to deal with being torqued out while trying to regain my former work capacity.  Can the Sheiko 4 day programs fit in more hypertrophy work or does the assistance work play the role for that?
powerlifting,3d6pr0,_Sir_Loin_of_Steak_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"The 4 day program seems to break up the daily workload a bit while keeping the same weekly volume for the lifts, from what I can tell.  You could likely fit more assistance work on a daily basis that way.  That's where you're going to get your hypertrophy work anyway."

powerlifting,3d45b1,AtomicValue,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm pretty short, 5'4"". I used to only pull conventional up until Jan 2015. I tweaked my back doing paused deadlifts in january (with 135 lbs :| ), had to take a few weeks off of lower body training. I decided to diet since my lower body training was hampered. Dieted from January until the beginning of June. i've always been lean (i was 115lbs my sophomore year of college, 27 y/o now, was 154lbs summer 2014, so the weight i gained to hit 170 was definitely a higher amount of fat than i needed to gain to get stronger) and i wanted to get back to being lean so i could set myself for a really long, smart bulk. dieting for 6 months and not gaining any strength during that time was frustrating, but i knew in the long run it would set me up for being in a better position to bulk later on.  Before my injury i was pulling 405 for 4 beltless conventional (with a PR in august of 415 being the most i ever pulled at around 160lbs). Sumo felt more comfortable upon returning to training. I followed the candito 6 week program (which i have been doing for the last 2 years) except i dialed back the weight for the deadlift to be a training max that i could use for sumo. It was always something i wanted to try, and i'm glad i made the switch. I'm going to bring conventional back into my training as a strength builder now though since i feel more comfortable in terms of having recovered from whatever i did to my back."

powerlifting,3d45b1,DaPrem,2,Mon Jul 13 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) lol actually i always thought they are kind of short they are pretty much exactly 5'4"" (my height) wingspan. do they appear long in the bench video?  i've been between 148 and 150 on my home scale since the beginning of june. I think it reads a lb or two too heavy since when i left my house i was 146.8 on my scale and i weighed in at 145.2 on the scale at the weigh in. i did do a minor water cut just to make sure i'd make weight. In retrospect i probably could have gotten away without it given my scale being a little off and the fact that 148 class is really up to 148.8lb or something. All i did was water load (2g/2g/1g/.5g) and take a 30 minute hot bath with epsom salt on the day of the weigh in. so yea, pretty much i've been walking around within the 148lb range give or take a lb or 2 of water up and down depending on the day."

I know the program is about going heavy to engage cns, and then moderate weight to drill in the gains. So I don't know if dropping hypertrophy deadlifts would be a bad idea."
powerlifting,3d6839,frak8757,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Hepburn is about going heavy, the 8x2-3 is at 80%. You get in a lot of smooth, easy submaximal reps.   Personally I don't have a problem with deadlifts for reps, if you know it doesn't work for you, modify it."
powerlifting,3d6839,ProgressiveOverlord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:26:02 2015 UTC,"There are a number of variations out there, which one are you thinking of following?  Hepburn is more of a training philosophy than a strict program, so yes you can (and I have) customize it to your needs."
powerlifting,3d6839,ProgressiveOverlord,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:33:24 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of running the fairly basic A program. That I found linked here  I was thinking of adding weighted pullups to the end of one day and barbell rows to the end of the other.
powerlifting,3d6839,ceejayess,2,Mon Jul 13 21:50:07 2015 UTC,I do the 8x2 as well except i have upper and lower lifts on their own days.  Rather than go into too much detail here's todays workout as an example of the way I've adapted Hepburn.  Push Press 8x2-3  ss/ neutral grip pullups 8x5-10(depending on how Im feeling that day)  Weighted Dips 5x5-8  ss/ more pullups  Pushups/Face-pulls 100 reps

powerlifting,3d2l66,bruddatim,12,Mon Jul 13 00:45:55 2015 UTC,At least in IPF I believe you have to be over 105
powerlifting,3d2l66,greenalleycat,2,Mon Jul 13 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"Correct. You compete at whatever class you weigh in at, no exceptions. If you register for the meet as a 105, and you weigh in under 105 and above 93, you compete at 105. However, if you weigh in under 93, or over 105, you will compete in the appropriate weight class."
powerlifting,3d2l66,GeneralMillss,7,Wed Jul 15 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Must weigh in at 105.01 to 120.0 .   Reasoning, IMO, would be that it could help a certain lift/give you a record you couldn't hit in a higher weight class.  Heavy guys usually struggle to DL. If you weighed in at 103 (because your deadlift leverages were good at that weight), you could potentially take the 120 deadlift record. Ex. My friend at 305 couldn't lock out 585, ate 205 he pulled 650 clean  'nom sayin?"

powerlifting,3d2l66,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:18:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be my reasoning for doing it. A certain record, in bench rather than deadlift, is more easily breakable in a higher weight class. If it gets closer to me leaving juniors, and I'm not close to breaking it, I may bulk up for that. Time will tell!"
powerlifting,3d2l66,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:05:21 2015 UTC,Always bulk! Always! omnomnomnomnom!
powerlifting,3d2l66,BenchPolkov,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:00:07 2015 UTC,Yep. IPF rules state over 105. If you're USAPL though I have no idea. Their rules are still a mixture of old and new for some reason.
powerlifting,3d2l66,marbiol,3,Mon Jul 13 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"But AFAIK, they don't state what you can be wearing at weigh-in...    (except to say that you can wear nothing)..."

powerlifting,3d2nou,MirageDK,14,Mon Jul 13 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"could be because it was his gym that ran the meet...I don't see any reason why it would have passed.  Like I've said before, if it was me I'd have got 3 reds, should be the same for anyone else performing a squat that high."

powerlifting,3d2nou,maymayyy_lmao420,4,Mon Jul 13 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"I think Eric's squat was pretty good.  That said, I think it's a shame that some of the other lifts/lifters that got passed in the meet will inevitably cast doubt on Eric's accomplishment."
powerlifting,3d2nou,Chicksan,6,Mon Jul 13 15:32:41 2015 UTC,Honestly kind of questioning if he even actually made the weight class.
powerlifting,3d2nou,BenchPolkov,6,Mon Jul 13 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"He would have needed to drop 35lbs in 3 weeks to make the 275lb class, and the meet doesn't have any records of people's bodyweight so.. I highly doubt it. Sure he could have water cut, but imo I doubt he did."
powerlifting,3d2nou,Gary_Oldman_AMA,2,Mon Jul 13 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I thought about this as well, especially after all the rumors about Ernie Jr not having to cut to the 198"
powerlifting,3d2nou,BenchPolkov,3,Mon Jul 13 18:32:01 2015 UTC,I don't think it was personally and I'm not alone. And then there's the question of whether he even made weight now. The whole meet sounds like a scam.
powerlifting,3d2nou,hflsmg17317,5,Mon Jul 13 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.  I'm not typically one of these guys who goes around talking shit about really strong dudes barely hitting depth or whatever... if I think it's borderline and it gets passed, I give the lifter the benefit of the doubt and appreciate what they've done.  That said, a lot of the lifts in this meet just looked so bad that it's just beyond ridiculous.  If the weight class thing is true, though, then that makes the whole thing all the worse.  I didn't hear about that."
powerlifting,3d2nou,Lou__Tennant,0,Mon Jul 13 21:33:23 2015 UTC,As a staunch IPF lifter I actually used to give Eric a modicum of respect for squatting to depth amongst a sea for shallow squatters but having seen a couple of dodgier squats from him recently and then this shit its all gone out the window. It really throws shade on anyone who was involved in hosting or supporting this meet in the first place. Even other IPA members seem to be up in arms over it (not that some of them in particular would know what depth is either...).

Was about a 9 RPE because of how fatigues I was.  Day 5: Up to 425 conventional. Was a 10 RPE and felt terrible, especially considering I pulled 440x3 for 2 sets leading up to the meet.  Day 7: Up to 405 sumo, which was a 40lb PR. Felt about 8 RPE.  Day 9: Up to 335x5 paused sumo @ 9 RPE.  Day 10: Up to 255x6 sumo stiff legged, obviously not very difficult.  Day 12: Up to 405x4 @ 9 sumo for a huge PR. 405x1 just a few days prior was a 40lb PR so I've never even been close to this level with sumo. Granted my PR with conventional was 405x6, I still feel great about it.  I also squatted just as often in this time period, even going to failure on a 335 front squat.

Meet went really well, hit 180 squat but missed 190, ended up with a torn hip flexor from the 2nd squat which was a bit crap. Went 100 on bench so no progress there unfortunately.

Those are some beastly numbers man, looking forward to catching you down there for the meet! Especially impressive cos (being first year) I'm guessing you're fairly young?"

I was going to do last year's one as a junior but the meet was the morning after my 18th so I was barely able to get out of bed. Tested a couple days earlier so I could claim 200/125/220 @96 as a 17 year old. Nats would have been impressive? Was Josh Takua competing? Saw him on the worlds stream and was mirin his deadlift.
powerlifting,3d1oyf,demetrius_savelio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:26:25 2015 UTC,"Not surprising you didn't make it hahaha. Those are beastly lifts man, nice. Should be good to watch you lift!   Nats was pretty cool, but I didn't watch anyone lift other than my own flight as I had family stuff the rest of the time. Was a bit lame cos they took all the top people in to lift on the Sunday in the record setters, so we didn't have the top guys in any of the weight classes.  Yea Josh lifted but didn't make any squats for some reason..."
powerlifting,3d1oyf,CallMeMo,2,Mon Jul 13 08:40:41 2015 UTC,"Oh thats a bit shit, would have been good to compete directly with the best. At least the judging would have been consistent I guess, so you can sort of compare."
powerlifting,3d1oyf,greenalleycat,2,Mon Jul 13 08:42:52 2015 UTC,"Bro your DL is semi-sumo! Any advice on pulling that way? After doing conventional and sumo I have realized this is the way I too need to pull. My arms are just a couple inches short for me to get into a good conventional starting position, and I can't feel my legs in a full sumo."
powerlifting,3d1oyf,CallMeMo,3,Mon Jul 13 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"Sure. With the semi-sumo you can choose to pull it as either a conventional or sumo, essentially. Basically you have a bit more room to sit between your hips than in a normal conventional pull, so if you start with your hips low and knees out then you can get a lot more push off the ground. Unfortunately my left hip is a bit crap so it hurts to do that, and so I choose to make it a bit more like a conventional pull. So I start with my hips quite high and use a lot more back.   I don't consider it to be a ""genuine"" stance; I have really long legs so I should be able to pull full sumo, just with mobility and (mainly) injury issues I can't. It also is useful for oddly proportioned people (like me) who struggle to get into conventional position.  If I had to give a ""guide"" to it though:   Pick a comfortable spacing, maybe halfway between a conventional and full sumo attempt Toes @ ~30 degrees out, roughly Sink between your hips until you can grip the bar Pull slack out of the bar as you move into your starting position; adjust hip position depending on what feels most comfortable for you (lower = more legs, higher = more back) Push with your legs and pull back with your back Lock out and win"

I don't feel that they alter the difficulty of the lift either. It's like wearing thick socks that stay in place.   I cannot really compare them to long socks, since I rarely wear them to deadlift.

powerlifting,3cwt22,caprosmaster,14,Sat Jul 11 16:10:56 2015 UTC,Benni's dealing with a quad injury at the moment I believe so pulled out of this recently.
powerlifting,3cwt22,BenchPolkov,4,Sat Jul 11 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Eddie Hall lifts a heavy thing...  Scott Mendleson and Eric Lilliebridge express epic butthurt in response.  [Update] - Mendy: ""but mah account was hacked!"""
powerlifting,3cwt22,ape288,5,Sun Jul 12 13:29:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what they're mad about tbh. Just lost a little respect for Lilliebridge.
powerlifting,3cwt22,BenchPolkov,5,Sun Jul 12 15:52:35 2015 UTC,Just hating on straps while ignoring or being ignorant of the fact that it was a strongman comp and straps are allowed.
powerlifting,3cwt22,ape288,2,Sun Jul 12 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nah I know. I just think it's ridiculous lol. Everyone knows it's a strongman thing and that Hall didn't ""take"" the powerlifting record from Benni. I guess I just feel like they of all people should be respectful of the feats performed since they understand better than anybody how much of yourself you have to give to accomplish something like this. The hate just seems so petty.  Plus this event is just awesome."
powerlifting,3cwt22,BenchPolkov,2,Sun Jul 12 16:08:59 2015 UTC,And if you read through the thread Mendy started someone even posted a vid of Benni competing at the comp last year in a suit and straps.
powerlifting,3cwt22,Chicksan,9,Sun Jul 12 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"I this even real life? A multiply lifter bitching about gear......thats legal to use in competition, per the rules......he is the biggest thunder-cunt in strength sports today"

powerlifting,3cwt22,fizzax,2,Sat Jul 11 17:10:33 2015 UTC,So is he actually wearing one and I can't see it?
powerlifting,3cwt22,Joshyboy1991,5,Sat Jul 11 20:35:21 2015 UTC,He isn't wearing one. Its hard to see but my friend was there.
powerlifting,3cwt22,ion128,3,Sat Jul 11 20:37:20 2015 UTC,Why does he always use straps
powerlifting,3cwt22,theNightblade,13,Sat Jul 11 18:59:47 2015 UTC,Because its strongman rules
powerlifting,3cwt22,shuzy,-5,Sat Jul 11 19:52:43 2015 UTC,He does wear a belt.  You can see it in his previous WR video https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=113&v=w95Yi9HcQ7s&t=1m50s[1]
powerlifting,3cwt22,dirtyid,2,Sat Jul 11 21:19:58 2015 UTC,Those are straps from the suit. It's beltless.

powerlifting,3cwt22,Chicksan,-2,Sat Jul 11 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Straps, still extremely impressive"
powerlifting,3cwt22,Danneborger,-10,Sat Jul 11 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"A strongman lift. It's not powerlifting style though, so not as impressive."
powerlifting,3cwt22,SoFisticate,19,Sat Jul 11 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he was being facetious, but definitely gets old"
powerlifting,3cwt22,jdd32,9,Sat Jul 11 17:17:06 2015 UTC,Just as fucking impressive. No one else can lift that with or without straps.
powerlifting,3cwt22,Danneborger,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:17:40 2015 UTC,"Of course not, it doesn't meet the same standard, so it's not as impressive. Besides, Magnusson has done 3 kg less, with seemingly plenty in the tank, without straps. Bolton has done 457 kg (albeit with a suit) without straps, Konstantin with 426 kg no belt no straps, Grachev, who's only around 105 kg has pulled 450 kg, with straps. Really, there are just a lot of deadlifts (relatively to that world level population) that are relatively better as they're being done by lighter lifters, without straps. Also many are done to powerlifting standards."
powerlifting,3cwt22,KrytieTV,3,Sat Jul 11 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind with Benni's lift was that it was with big iron plates and I believe a deadlift bar. With the big plates amd extra bending the full weight will come of the floor later. That will definitely add a fair amount to your lift (still only talking 5-10kg). Eddie's lift seems to have been done woth a stiff bar and small plates.   On the either hand, it does seem he's wearing somekind of suit-like thing considering all the chalk bursting of his legs. Seems like it's quite tight and might be adding some pounds.  Not trying to take anything away from Benni or Eddie here, they're both amazing lifters. Just trying to put it into perspective."
powerlifting,3cwt22,bassment_dweller,0,Sat Jul 11 22:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah and nobody can run 100m in track spikes as fast as Usain Bolt, but we don't post that shit here because this is a powerlifting subreddit."

powerlifting,3cwt22,dustyterran,-2,Sat Jul 11 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"Funny how he deadlifts conventional, all these younger guys are pulling sumo. Almost all I see is sumo now, conventional for life."
powerlifting,3cwt22,gzcl,14,Sun Jul 12 03:42:19 2015 UTC,You cannot sumo in strongman. Only in powerlifting.

All of the strongest deadlifters pull conventional, even those not in strongman (Leeman, Spegal, Cass, Lillebridges, etc.) I'm just curious as to what you think, as well as anyone else. Personally, I find sumo easier and more comfortable, but seeing these people all pull conventional makes me second guess myself"
powerlifting,3cwt22,gzcl,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:31 2015 UTC,"Sumo tends to be difficult to be technically proficient at when being an extremely large human being. So I'd say, stongmen won't be able to our sumo their conventional."

powerlifting,3cyyho,Thatonekid131,33,Sun Jul 12 01:31:09 2015 UTC,"It's becoming increasingly obvious to me that only a few federations (USAPL, XPC, USPA) are worth giving world records through. The Lilliebridge meet yesterday was a joke, the Mike Lucia squat was barely a half squat, Sr. Squatted a mile high, and Eric's squat was questionable, even if he actually tried to hit depth. Not to mention the spotters with their hands on the bar and bench pressing that should really be called touch and go.   ""You get a world record, you get a world record, you all get world records!""  Anyway, does titan have student discount? And if so, what are a good pair of knee wraps from them for a beginner? I want more elastic, less casting."
powerlifting,3cyyho,PavidDagan,16,Sun Jul 12 03:59:29 2015 UTC,I just saw Lucia's squat video thinking that this sub might be overreacting.  Nope. You were all correct.

powerlifting,3cyyho,HomebrewJ,3,Mon Jul 13 00:39:33 2015 UTC,You want to shake your head?  Read his comments in the thread he posted.
powerlifting,3cyyho,MasteronAndCommander,3,Mon Jul 13 10:41:11 2015 UTC,"Good grief the abject denial is almost impressive. My favorite comment is when he says his squat might not be deep enough ""for the USAPL"". what, so a place that consistently enforces a standard? I don't even like the USAPL and I respect the standard they hold their lifters to."
powerlifting,3cyyho,theknightmanager,5,Mon Jul 13 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Not only the depth, but he didn't even stabilize the bar after the rep, they just swung the arms down.   That wouldn't even be legal in an APA meet."
powerlifting,3cyyho,TheAesir,4,Sun Jul 12 06:32:03 2015 UTC,XPC should include its affiliates (UPA and RPS) as well. Beyond that APF has been putting on phenomenal meets in the past few years as well.

You don't get excited about a loved ones' PRs because of how they measure up to anybody else's. You get excited because you know how much work that person put in for it and you love them; so by extension you're happy. I'm picturing my girlfriend coming up to me after a deadlift PR and going ""Yeah you know Pozdeev would have pulled that for like twenty."" Tell her to fuck off."

powerlifting,3cyyho,Gary_Oldman_AMA,3,Mon Jul 13 03:59:12 2015 UTC,Dude. Dump her ass.  It's one thing to have a girl who is supportive of lifting and you getting stronger.  That's fantastic.  We all should strive to be with someone who is supportive/helps us be the best we can be.  But constantly comparing you to an ex and putting you down for not meeting her standards is bullshit.  You get to have standards too.

powerlifting,3cyyho,PassthatVersayzee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:51:13 2015 UTC,I've been doing 531 for the last few months and the numbers are pretty low at first so I haven't benched 315 in a long time. I was hoping that today I could beat my previous record of 3 reps and hit 5 but I only got an ugly 4 :(  Where are you for your 1rm right now?
powerlifting,3cyyho,bruddatim,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:52:37 2015 UTC,"When I hit 335 a few weeks ago, I was doing a 3x3 with 295, so I'm hoping my 1rm is 355-365 with a 3x3 at 315. not sure yet though.   Looking at records for the 93kg class in USAPL Collegiate and junior division, I could beat it with not much above a 405 bench. Seems doable by the end of 2016."
powerlifting,3cyyho,PassthatVersayzee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:08:01 2015 UTC,"That's an insane bench, especially at your body weight. I have a similar bench to you but I weigh around 255 lbs. If you could hit 4 plates at your bodyweight that would be amazing. Keep up the good work man."
powerlifting,3cyyho,bruddatim,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:41:14 2015 UTC,"I do sit at 215, but im like 20% body fat, so cutting down to 205 wouldnt be difficult. Im really hoping for a 405 bench, that would be an awesome day for me"
powerlifting,3cyyho,failon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"So what's your plan? I think most people will agree that bench is the hardest lift to gain numbers on. If you want to improve quickly I think you need an awesome plan or you need to bulk like crazy. The quickest jump I did was when I slowed down with regular bench and started doing almost only accessory barbell work for almost two months. Floor press, pin press, banded bench, dumbell variations etc. It definitely helped me. I just changed to a powerlifting gym so now I'm going to really focus on accessory work like chains and slingshot bench. We'll see how it goes. Have you done a meet yet? How have you gotten to where you are right now?"
powerlifting,3cyyho,Dreadlifts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"I started powerlifting in january, prior to that, I had been lifting/dicking around since freshman year of high school (7 years). Basically, I had been doing hypertrophic training for 7 years and had packed on a lot of lean muscle mass. When I played football in high school I had like, a 285 bench, but that's the most I hit. I had also never deadlifted prior to january. So, in january, I decided I wanted to get strong, and started strong lifts 5x5. I maxed out at 255 for bench. I did 185 for my first 5x5 workout. And I have just kept progressing. In the last month, I've started changing it up slightly, when I go in the gym feeling like I'll probably fail my next 5x5 weight, I hit a 3x3 with 20-30 pounds more than my 5x5 would be. Then the next workout I can usually bang out the 5x5 set without failing.   I think my situation is what is leading to these gains. I am getting noob gains out the ass with my Central nervous response, but I also have 7 years of muscle mass built, so the CNS has a shitton more mass to work with. This has lead to these gains. Honestly, my bench hasn't slown yet, and the only accessory work I do is close grip, and OHP. I think towards the end of the summer, and hopefully close to a 385 bench, ill have to start adapting my programming."

powerlifting,3cyyho,Dreadlifts,2,Sun Jul 12 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'm really thinking it's more 7 years of prep, and reaping the benefits of all that prep in a short amount of time, rather than having good genetics or something.   To highlight how much my previous training has helped bench. I really never deadlifted, and my Dead lift is currently at like... 425.. I also really never took squat seriously after I finished high school, so it's only at 445."

powerlifting,3cyyho,failon,5,Sun Jul 12 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"It was a shitty Groupon massage. 90 minutes of some little guy with no understanding of anatomy trying to impress me with how deep he could go, after being told that I'm more interested in facilitating recovery than breaking anything down or fixing anything.  I normally speak up if they do something I don't like and most therapists have no problem adjusting, but I didn't even know where to start with this guy. I never felt like he was going to hurt me, but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Never checked in with me once, left for a few minutes in the middle of the session leaving me undraped, and spoke very abrasively and percussively when he wanted me to do something. Pretty much did everything wrong.  The dude has been practicing for the better part of a decade and came highly recommended.  If he had been my student, he would be going through remediation right now.  So frustrating."
powerlifting,3cyyho,NikhilT90,6,Sun Jul 12 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yea you're a PT right? It's already frustrating to watch someone do something wrong that your familiar with, but it must be another thing to experience it"
powerlifting,3cyyho,Foliage24,4,Sun Jul 12 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"Almost a PT. Another few months and you can call me Dr. Deadlift.  Been a massage therapist for 8 years, though. During the massage all I could think of was how to prevent a situation like this from ever happening again. Dangerous in itself, it almost made me want to teach again..."
powerlifting,3cyyho,Catechin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:14:45 2015 UTC,what kind of direction or what do you ask for when you get body work done?
powerlifting,3cyyho,DrColossus1,2,Mon Jul 13 04:59:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what I need done and how well I know the therapist.  If I know them well and need specific work done, I might just tell them something like strip my paraspinals and get at those trigger points in my glutes and hip rotators. There are perhaps half a dozen people I'd feel comfortable doing that with, none of whom are local to me.  In this case, I didn't know the therapist at all and didn't want anything beyond a general moderately deep recovery massage. I told him I had already lifted that day, was already going to be sore, and was more interested in facilitating recovery than grinding away and trying to ""fix"" stuff. I told him I was interested in a massage that I didn't have to recover from.  Normally I can give feedback on pressure and guide the therapist as needed, but this dude completely disregarded anatomy and was slipping and sliding over bumps from all directions. He continued one stroke from my deltoid to my neck (almost jumping clear off my traps) then straight back down over the middle of the scapula from spine to inferior angle. With his elbow. If he struggled to control a deep off-course stroke, he'd add more lotion instead of taking some off, just making it worse.  I was at a complete loss for words the whole time.  Thinking about it is making me angry, so I'm gonna do something else now."

powerlifting,3cxfl9,HPPD2,2,Sun Jul 12 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Ignoring that, does it not objectively make sense to trim down the number of weight classes for them? It makes competition better so there aren't so few people competing in some of the classes- think of how many local or even bigger meets there are with the old system with zero or 1 lifter in competing in a class. And why should a drug tested federation need a 308 class and a SHW class?"
powerlifting,3cxfl9,TheAesir,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about fewer weight classes as it makes more sense for larger meets. Local meets don't mean much in the grand scheme of things. I do feel like the age divisions need trimmed however. Juniors should be moved to under 20, open up to 40, and masters after that. Feds with extras like fire/police, crossfit, ect need to be dropped as well.  Let's not get into the ipf and testing."

powerlifting,3cxfl9,bigcoachD,2,Sat Jul 11 19:17:44 2015 UTC,I have never had Problems with my state's UPA meets. Well run and consistent with what they ask of the athlete's. UPA is by far my favorite fed.
powerlifting,3cxfl9,TheAesir,5,Sat Jul 11 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"Hell, Relentless Minnesota and Detroit are the two biggest charity powerlifting events in the US, and both are under the UPA banner.

powerlifting,3cxfl9,zarideremery,11,Sun Jul 12 15:23:58 2015 UTC,"Nobody's ""talking shit"" about your lift, they're just saying it was too high to count in other federations."
powerlifting,3cxfl9,BenchPolkov,7,Sun Jul 12 15:32:45 2015 UTC,If a lift is high it shouldn't count in any federation. They all have the same definition of depth.
powerlifting,3cxfl9,zarideremery,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:53 2015 UTC,So are you saying since his lift passed in the IPA that it would've passed in USPA or IPF?
powerlifting,3cxfl9,BenchPolkov,8,Sun Jul 12 22:40:55 2015 UTC,I'm saying it probably shouldn't have passed in any federation. The reffing at this meet was categorically bullshit.

powerlifting,3cxfl9,sdre,5,Sun Jul 12 23:27:35 2015 UTC,"I think this sub and /u/weightroom have an  awesome community because be it a world record setter or the average Joe asking for a squat check; we will call out a high squat as a high squat.   We don't care how big, strong, famous or how weak, small and weak you are.   If the lift counts, it counts."
powerlifting,3cxfl9,Isilrac23,5,Sun Jul 12 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've competed in rps and uspa, every rps meet I competed with gene there has been legit depth calls, I've been called on Depth for what others think i was robbed.  Competed uspa once and was a shit show.  Terrible.  However uspa in the north east isn't prevalent like in other parts of the country.  Same with rps.  Rps is mainly north east, if you go outside of that maybe the judging will be inconsistent.  I think Eric's squat may be legit, we need a side angle.  Everybody else's were junk no questions."
powerlifting,3cxfl9,chuckechaps,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:12:18 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna get down voted to shit but I've done one of Shawna Mendelson's IPA meets and they're run great.  Depth was no joke, even for us Multi-Ply guys lol Shes also real helpful and understands the meets are hectic for lifters and tries to not rush anyone around. Really was great though and would do another one   So it's really not the IPA its the Meet Directors that run shitty meets."
powerlifting,3cxfl9,theycallmenick91,-10,Sun Jul 12 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I get it that some of squats were high, I believe Eric's were to depth, but who the fuck honestly cares? So a few world records were broken with controversial lifts, who cares? When I first started training for powerlifting and competing I never once thought about breaking a record, or winning a competition but rather being a better me every single time. It's not about winning against anyone else, because we're all passionate about this with one real goal in mind, that's to get better. And sure I've broken a regional RPS record which I thought was cool, but I don't honestly care anymore, it doesn't make me any better. People should stop worrying so much about what other people are doing and worry about your own lifts. That's what I thought powerlifting was all about, getting better, but apparently it's about world records and bitching about depth."
powerlifting,3cxw3e,danranges_,31,Sat Jul 11 19:36:21 2015 UTC,"I love Eric's lifts. He's the best. That said, depth is not typically a problem for him but this looked a smidge high."

powerlifting,3cyjj7,Exci_,12,Sat Jul 11 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"Like most ""rules"" it's a generalisation - dependant on levers and deadlift technique."
powerlifting,3cyjj7,BenchPolkov,5,Sun Jul 12 06:51:59 2015 UTC,"People've mentioned wasted effort displacing the bar horizontally, but it also tends to hurt positioning. In the gif you can see how Brett's hips move up more than the barbell does while he's shifting it in, and in full speed you can see he loses momentum off the floor adjusting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0vA_GAzEuQ#t=3m06s, and he ends up having a bit harder of a time at lockout than he might've otherwise. You can survive with your center of gravity a bit off, but it can mess up speed, positioning, and timing—it's a bit inefficient."
powerlifting,3cyjj7,Marcel-P,9,Sun Jul 12 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"In general, rule.  This view is most notably present in Rippetoe's analysis from Starting Strength.  Say what you want about Rip but his argument is persuasive.  The argument is that a heavy bar will end up plumb over the midfoot anyway.  If you think about it, you actually have to put more effort into horizontally displacing a heavy deadlift.  It should just move in a straight line.    As for the Lewis video I think he moves it over the midfoot almost immediately after he pulls off the ground (if you note him dragging it up his shins).  The bar path is almost perfectly vertical."
powerlifting,3cyjj7,mrcosmicna,5,Sat Jul 11 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"it absolutely does drift back the instant it comes off the ground, not sure why he doesn't just start it there, but obviously it works for him"
powerlifting,3cyjj7,Lobsterzilla,6,Sat Jul 11 23:59:47 2015 UTC,"While it is an undisputable fact that having the bar start from the mid-foot is the most efficient start position to use, to get the bar to lockout with applying the absolute minimum amount of force (let's call it x units of force) to the bar, it may be the case that starting from a different position lets you use your body's musculature in a stronger way that lets you apply (y) units of extra force. If the mechanical disadvantage (z) you lose from a different start position is less than (y), then you will be able to lift more weight from the ""inefficient"" starting position.   tl;dr You may be able to lift more from an ""inefficient"" position because everyone's body is different."
powerlifting,3cyjj7,jdub129,6,Sun Jul 12 05:00:02 2015 UTC,At which point you've found your most efficient positioning.
powerlifting,3cyjj7,nathanwoulfe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:22:23 2015 UTC,If this was a rule two persons with exactly the same build except the size of their feet should have different starting positions.

I really like how you laid out your philosophy but it's not exactly groundbreaking stuff, right?  I mean, powerbuilders have been doing this since the 60s.    Props to you for being one of the few people to put it in an easy to understand way, though.  I've been running a tiered based program for the last 6 weeks or so (my offseason mode) and have been enjoying it quite a bit."
powerlifting,3cw700,theNightblade,2,Mon Jul 13 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Oh no, it's nothing ""new"" and I've never claimed my ideas are unique to me. All I've done is put this knowledge put in an easy to understand way so that most lifters can read and apply, in a more personalize manner, this style of training.  Stoked to hear you've applied it and are enjoying it. Any progress in the last 6-weeks?"
powerlifting,3cw700,gzcl,3,Mon Jul 13 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"My beltless squats and deads have gotten better for sure.  From 345 squat for a single, to multiple sets of 2 at 335 and multiple singles at 345.  Was planning to go back to belted at the end of August to prep for my next meet in November.    I'm pretty sure I need more bench volume though so likely will be going back to 3-4 days a week benching."
powerlifting,3cw700,theNightblade,3,Mon Jul 13 18:27:22 2015 UTC,For bench maybe think about making one of those days a slingshot day and use 90-100% of your max for about 20-30 total reps. Makes that weight feel like bitch weight.
powerlifting,3cw700,gzcl,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:52 2015 UTC,When I run Sheiko 4 day that's what's worked for me.  A day that's either board press or slingshot for overloading but saving the shoulders a bit.

Lol but for real its a borderline squat that you left up to the judges to make the call instead of leaving no doubt. And I've heard SR say you don't get extra points for going deeper but at least it's a  not a sketchy asss squat then.

Also, you can simplify a lot of these lifts into multi segment static problems. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK1a6VHQTHQ Massthetics did something similar when looking at deadlifting in oly shoes.

And keep working on lower back and abs with your assistance, of course.   This might be worth a read: http://www.strengtheory.com/the-belt-bible/"

powerlifting,3ct7oh,Danneborger,3,Fri Jul 10 16:13:21 2015 UTC,Keep using the belt.   When I was around your strength I was running Texas Method where I would do   Volume Squats on Monday w/ Belt Light(-ish) High Bar Squats on Wednesday w/o Belt Heavy Squats on Friday w/ Belt   I also used knee sleeves every time I squatted.  This was a period of time where I increased my squat pretty rapidly to a max of about 435.  After a while I wasn't be able to linearly progress anymore and that's when I switched to a periodized program (Sheiko) where I used the belt on all sets that were over 70%.
powerlifting,3ct7oh,Spaghetti-hoes,2,Fri Jul 10 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"My quads really need work.   Wearing a belt (or not) will have zero impact on how much work your quads will perform, assuming your form doesn't differ significantly between the two.

I have worked out in Crossfit gyms quite a bit and would suggest you save your money and avoid their advice if your goal is progress. Crossfit is great if you simply want to lift for exercise, not training, and enjoy the comradery.  Otherwise you may want to train mostly on your own with occasional trips via public transportation to a place like Boss Barbell (Dan Green), CSA (Jesse Burdick), Max's Gym (Max Aita), Jon Anderson Fitness, 1825 Gym or Wild Iron Gym. I know a gal who commute 75 miles each direction to train at CSA and thinks it's absolutely worth it. There's also SuperTraining in Sacramento which is a great place to lift and full of crazy strong lifters, it's fun seeing 700+ squats in person.  If you ever want to try weightlifting you're in luck, as there's some great coaches and athletes in the city!"

I have been lifting for a long time and the big three have been in my rotation for a few years now. I have been doing 5/3/1 for the last few months and it's been great, but I feel like training for a meet is a whole different thing, based on what I've seen of other powerlifters.  And, yeah, I'm definitely not looking to join a CrossFit gym - that's just all I've been able to find so far :) Not going to hate on anyone who enjoys it, but not my thing, and probably not what I should be doing while trying to get ready to compete in powerlifting.  Dungeon Gym looks sick, I'll have to reach out and see if I could get in. The other gyms you mentioned, I will check out. Does seem like I am going to have to commute for a coach. While I'd obviously prefer to have something close by, I'm definitely willing to put some time and money to do this."

Technically, I shouldn't have used ""only"" (perhaps, instead, ""mostly"").  I've never done any Olympic lifts, in any case.  My first sentence could be rewritten ""I've only done powerlifting lifts there, except [that I have also done, as accessory lifts,] powerclean and press.""  To say that SFIron is ""focused on Olympic lifts"" seems inaccurate.  They know how to coach them if you are interested, and they may be used as accessory lifts, but I wouldn't call that ""focused""."
powerlifting,3cp5a7,_predator_,5,Thu Jul 9 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"I ruptured my right medial meniscus in karate when I was 15 (20 now). No surgery because the tear was essentially in the middle of the cartilage and the meniscus sits as if it is entirely intact, despite the injury.   Since I never had surgery, I can't comment well on the effects it has on a young man (my father has had a meniscus surgery on each knee but that was after 20 years of just living with them).  However, I can attest to the high-volume training being particularly beneficial. My knees never hurt (although my patellar tendons are what usually hurt). High frequency is also quite helpful and eventually you'll feel stable enough to work up to heavy triples/doubles each week with another squat day for more volume.  You don't want to swap barbell movements out for dumbbells. This is powerlifting, you train the movements you'll compete with and everything else is accessory. You can't use an accessory to replace a main movement. If it's that bad to wait around, find a better gym. You'll get much more out of sheiko if you can stick to the base and play around with the numbers a touch (I did)."

Sounds reasonable, I guess I will definitely do a high frequency/volume, lower(-ish) intensity program, even if it won't be Sheiko.  The problem is that I don't have another option than to train in that gym for the time being, I considered doing Sheiko before but always turned away from it because of this issue."

Current routine  3x10 body weight squats using a yoga ball leaning on Wall (only as deep as comfortable/less than 90 degrees)  Leg extensions 3x10 sitting on bed with no weight  Standing Leg Curl (no added weight)  Semi prone Leg raise Balancing on one foot ~1 minute   Can't wait to get the barbell back on my back but I'd be pissed if I did too much too quickly and fucked something up.   As for when I finally start squatting again, I'll probably just do some sort of linear progression high frequency routine and start super light.  Had your doctor given you a time frame for when you can finally start lifting again?"
powerlifting,3cp5a7,Plantheparade,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:03:48 2015 UTC,"No, he said that most likely my physio will tell me when I can do (serious) weight training again.

At the moment I can't walk without crutches and my knee is still swollen to a good amount. The most I can do is some knee flexion and extension in a small range of motion to keep the joint somewhat active. I'm looking forward to do any kind of leg movement, even rehab related, as I couldn't do any leg stuff since my injury in january...  Thanks for sharing your routine, I saved it in my notes and might start doing it when I feel my knee can handle it. Are you back in the gym for upper body stuff though? And if so, can you barbell bench or even OHP?  Yes, starting slow is obviously the best advice on this. I can't imagine going through this crap again.

powerlifting,3cp5a7,s0ckfasteat,2,Thu Jul 9 21:16:06 2015 UTC,"Hi, OP! About three years ago, I had surgery for a torn meniscus, dislocation, and torn MCL. Being extremely anxious and nervous, it was a solid year before I started working out again. However, I was not into powerlifting at that time. This past November, I fractured my collarbone from deadlifting. It was a solid six months before I got back into it. The most important advice I will give is do not push yourself too hard too soon. You will just re injure yourself again. When I started training after my collarbone injury, I started with Starting strength and SLOWLY worked my way back into heavy weights. If something didn't feel right, I stopped right then and there. It's important to listen to your body. I know you'll be extremely anxious to get back into heavy lifting, but it'll just be so much more disappointing if you re-injure yourself because you tried to come back too quickly. It's a slow process. Embrace it. Focus on form and having a healthy mental attitude towards the whole process. You'll do great! Good luck on your comeback! :)"
powerlifting,3cp5a7,kmhwho,5,Thu Jul 9 22:55:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just curious, what about the deadlift caused you fracture your collarbone? Sometimes I hear a benign feeling pop in mine whenever I prep to unrack a squat."

I knew something was wrong. I actually have a YouTube video of when it happened - you can't really see much other than me cussing at the end because it hurt so damn badly.

I ended up struggling much more than I should have on my training days. If you're doing Sheiko, you need to save your energy, and you need to REST. You get stronger and build muscle from rest. This was probably the most difficult thing for me to accept -- I was so used to exercising 5 days a week at least. The most I will do on my off days now is stretching/mobility, maybe some abs, or rowing.  If you are following a sequence of blocks, usually, the first block will be a preparatory block, which prepares you for the amount of volume and overreaching you will be doing in the coming blocks."

powerlifting,3co8zu,TheAesir,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"I don't have a meet planned, most likely not until next year. I'm starting grad school in the fall so i want a three day a week program. I've heard good things about Sheiko, and I've just about tapped out the conjugate method. Not to mention that my form has gone to shit from doing nothing but pushing maxes.   How long should i run cycles of this program for?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,theknightmanager,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:43 2015 UTC,How long should i run cycles of this program for?   I answered this above. Run the programs straight through. 32 will have you taper for a meet. Just test your max at the end of it. Then start over.
powerlifting,3co8zu,dirtyid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. One of the articles I read said that the program continues to change as you progress through it, and that at the highest level it's a five day a week program. Not that I expect to get there in any kind of quick fashion. I'll stick to my beginner/intermediate level stuff until I'm actually competitive."
powerlifting,3co8zu,pendrekky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmp6rSrZbCJpS9dNg8FqRQm2f7-34m2OxtsKt8346tw/edit#gid=868266362  This is a spreadsheet based off the 3 day under 80kg program with some better graphs. You can see how volume (NL = number of lift) and average intensity waves throughout each week, how intensity gradually increases. Loading focus shows which lifts are emphasized, i.e. #37 is a fuck ton of benching, more squats than deadlift, #30 tones down on bench for more squat and dead work, 32 is taper.   I'm not an expert at all, but basically the program have you wave between different combination of high, medium or low weeks of volume (stress dosages) to manage and build fatigue. Overall volume goes down between cycles (1110 to 989 to 543 lifts) Intensity gets ramped up, reps go down, sets go up until an examination on week 9 followed by taper until competition on week 12. Read the posts on the forums for overarching principles. What's provided is just a general template (that worked well for me), but ultimately if you want to eventually customize Sheiko you have to find out how your body best responds to volume (smaller lifters generally do more, bigger lifters generally do less for recovery), which stress dosage combinations works best, and which assistance exercises you need."
powerlifting,3co8zu,Catechin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:01:52 2015 UTC,Have a question on the conjugate method. On ME days - how do you judge if you want to go 5-10lbs higher than your last week's ME? you can't really know it that precisely - are you expected to PR every week on ME?  Also - Do you do let's say squat variations for multiple weeks in a row or alternate that with a deadlift variation?
powerlifting,3co8zu,pendrekky,3,Thu Jul 9 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"Pick a different variation each time.  You should never be competing against last week's PR.  Worst case scenario, pick a different rep count if you really want to repeat the movement.  You very well could hit a PR every ME day if you just constantly switch up your rep counts and exercises. (I mean, just between free squat and paused squat, there's 6 different ME workouts which would take 12 weeks to hit alternating with deads)   Also - Do you do let's say squat variations for multiple weeks in a row or alternate that with a deadlift variation?   It's up to you, but I prefer switching between squat and deadlift every week, and that's how most people run it."
powerlifting,3co8zu,Catechin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:21:39 2015 UTC,I was certain that you do the variation a few times so you at least become good at it. So you do that variation only for one session and then basically not to it for at least 4-6 weeks?  So a 10 week block for lower ME would look like this?;  *=weeks   Comp. squat Comp. deadlift Paused Squat Deficit DL High bar Squat Block deadlift Safety bar squat Sumo deadlift Retest comp. squat Retest comp. deadlift
powerlifting,3co8zu,pendrekky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"You can do any variation you want so long as it's targeting your weak point.  Don't forget that both 1RM, 2RM, and 3RM count as separate exercises for ME days.  You could extend those first 8 weeks to 24 weeks just by varying the rep count.  So, if you wanted you could do, say:   3RM pause squat 3RM deficit deadlift 2RM pause squat 2RM deficit deadlift 1RM pause squat 1RM deficit deadlift 1RM comp squat 1RM comp deadlift   Or, heck...   3RM comp squat 3RM comp deadlift 2RM comp squat 2RM comp deadlift 1RM comp squat 1RM comp deadlift   So long as you're working your weak point, it's all gravy.  For me, by picking a variation I haven't done in a while (or ever before), it allows me to constantly set PRs.  This is enormously psychologically gratifying.  None of the variations should be all that different to the point where you really need to practice them.  Yeah, you might not be 100% efficient at said variation, but that's not the point of the ME days.  You're just trying to get generally strong.  If you want to get better at a specific variation, it's probably better to use that as an accessory movement (e.g. I exclusively high bar as an accessory movement and am not going to use it as a ME movement anytime soon)."

powerlifting,3co8zu,MetallicGray,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, for raw lifters it's generally recommended to only switch between around 3 exercise variations for each powerlift on the ME days."
powerlifting,3co8zu,newtonism,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:32:15 2015 UTC,"I follow a sort of conjugate method program. I personally have hit PRs every max effort day. However I don't go below a 3rm. I feel like a 3rm is a sweet spot to be able to do it regularly and not fry your CNS.   I don't do variations on max effort, just normal squats, or deads, or bench. I might change up the reps if I feel I need to, but right now I'm progressing about 5lbs a week on squat and deadlift, so I'll change up when I need to.  On the dynamic days I'll do some variation with a lighter weight. So for example I'll do maybe pause squats, or squats with bands."

I really like the basic template of candito with simple movements and 4-5times a week with upper and lower body splits. Maybe extend the program with some more hypertrophy to get that volume?"

In all honesty, I should have started cutting earlier, but I wanted to be able to evaluate my first experience with the new program I was trying without other factors affecting the results. If I was cutting on it and made shitty progress I wouldn't know if I should attribute it to the program itself or my diet.  If you don't want to cut yet, you should reduce your surplus so you don't get fat. You do NOT want to get fat and have a gut unless you plan on keeping that gut. Having to drop weight AND get used to your body type [and with that, your leverages and possibly your 'ideal' form for each lift] changing at the same time is really terrible and there's no upside to it.  That said, you're gonna be better off dropping some fat sooner rather than later. You can drop to like 12% and start bulking again. No need to drop to 10% or below if you just plan on bulking back up.   You want to be as efficient with your time as possible. Getting too lean while cutting affects performance and usually means at least a little muscle loss. Getting too fat while bulking makes it harder to keep gaining mass in an efficient manner, you eventually have to spend so much time shedding the fat that you're set behind. Try to stay between 10-20% bf at all times imo."
powerlifting,3co8zu,Metallicadpa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:42 2015 UTC,So should i just keep doing my current program (canditos linear program) or should i change it? And will i be able to add some pounds to my lifts while in a small deficit?
powerlifting,3co8zu,IPullSumoIEatButt,2,Thu Jul 9 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you'll probably still make gains even on a deficit since you're relatively new to it. If you don't want to cut yet, keep a slight surplus so you don't get fat. Then, when you feel like you're ready to cut, go for it.  Personally, I'd suggest that you start cutting right away. 15% is an awkward body fat to bulk at. Yes, you probably won't get too fat if you're careful, but you're not going to be able to keep the bulk up for too long. And it's generally a better idea to keep your bulks long and steady. You're better off paving the way for a 3-4+ month long bulk by doing your cut now."

powerlifting,3co8zu,RedSpikeyThing,2,Thu Jul 9 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"Any cues, or mobility routines to help open up the hips and have them closer to the bar for sumo? I was reviewing my third attempt from my last meet, and everything about that pull seemed inefficient - hips were high and away from the bar."
powerlifting,3co8zu,exatorp,3,Thu Jul 9 14:15:19 2015 UTC,http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XJxSlWO5Ctg  This is brutal but helps a lot  Combined with this as a warmup   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EN6HAheRHYQ  And the butterfly stretch is what Pozdeev recommends for getting the knees out
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"As for cues, I don't have a link atm, but I remember watching a Dan Green video a couple of weeks ago where he said to try to keep your hips over the bar instead of just trying to push the closer. This (along with 'spreading the floor') really helped me open up my hips, combined with lots of stretching."
powerlifting,3co8zu,Dreadlifts,2,Thu Jul 9 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"There was one video I saw with Dave Tate in it where he gave the cue ""drop your nuts onto the bar."" Paints a pretty good picture in my opinion."
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,2,Fri Jul 10 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"I've gone back to lowbar squatting and once the weight goes above 315 or so I have trouble locking my thoracic spine back into place, causing me to lean forward, and then my left knee starts hurting right below my kneecap.  What cues do you guys use to maintain good squat posture?  I've read about people training lats specifically for thoracic stability, anything else I should be working on?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,Dreadlifts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:32 2015 UTC,One that's worked well for me recently is fucking my elbows under the bar. Try and rotate your elbows so they are under the bar; they probably won't get there but that tightness helps bring the chest up and engage the lats.  Another cue that works is trying to bend the bar around your shoulders. You want to push the bar against your back really hard to get everything tight.
powerlifting,3co8zu,Semper_Sometime,2,Fri Jul 10 14:21:34 2015 UTC,Why do I always have one shitty lift? Doesn't matter what my programming is. There's always a single lift that lags.
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,4,Thu Jul 9 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Really, I feel like I have asked this before but how much am I fucking myself over by using straps in training? I have been stuck with the shittiest pull (a wobbly 390lbs) for months but I recently invested in a proper belt (and set my old tapered belt on fire), set up my straps, and managed to pull a ridiculously smooth 25lbs PR while being already fatigued from my squat and my main deadlift sets. Everything felt so smooth and fast. I am actually beginning to feel optimistic wrt to adding some kg to my deadlift.  I have small hands and a bad grip, and while chalk helps a bit (I do my main sets with it) it doesn't solve the problem. This leads to 2 questions:   Should I keep the straps as a way to overload (so after my main sets) or should I use them for my top sets and add additional grip work (farmer's walk, etc.) to try and make up for it? Switching from an old useless belt to a powerlifting belt gave me a 25lbs PR (with still some in the tank). Is that common or does it indicate that I brace myself like a little bitch?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,cryolithic,5,Thu Jul 9 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see an issue with using straps as long as you do sufficient volume with rowing, and extra grip work if necessary. At the end of the day you have to be able to hold on to maximum weight for (hopefully) a couple seconds in competition (with professional, high quality, sharp knurling barbells). In my case, I started exclusively using straps for all of my working sets a year and some change ago, and in competition, grip has never been a problem"
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"I pull twice a week (on lower body days) and barbell row twice a week (on upper body days), would you say that it's reasonable to progress one day without straps and one day with, provided I keep all my rowing strap-less?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,cryolithic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"It's reasonable if one of those pull days are much lighter, or you're just doing it for volume instead of hitting some prescribed numbers (i.e. SLDLs at 60% for 4 sets of 8-12 or something)"
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,2,Thu Jul 9 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"I've moved away from straps (best pull is 523). For me, the mechanics feel different, and I get a false sense of security. I almost have to relearn a regular pull afterwards. double overhand may help, especially if you feel imbalanced. But I just pull heavy at least once a week. It's very likely that the straps contribute more to your PR than the belt. I would pull once a week, switch up stances and grips. Run through cues. and test every 4 weeks."
powerlifting,3co8zu,cryolithic,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"I feel that the straps help me forget about holding the bar and focus on the mechanics of the rest of my body. Since I am used to pulling twice a week, I think I'll keep one session strapless and one session strapped and try to progress them in parallel."
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:33 2015 UTC,What grip style are you using?
powerlifting,3co8zu,cryolithic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:55 2015 UTC,Mixed grip.
powerlifting,3co8zu,needlzor,2,Thu Jul 9 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"Do you double overhand at all?  Me personally, I only switch to mix once I'm losing grip on my last rep with double overhand. This works grip strength a lot.  This one might seem simple, but always carry your plates via plate pinch.  You could also try some pulls with Fat Gripz (no affiliation).  Edit: I would say the most important is not using switch until you absolutely have to. I double over for anything 315 and under currently."
powerlifting,3co8zu,platemath,0,Thu Jul 9 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"I double overhand up to my last warmup, which I repeat with both grips (so for a session with 350, something like 5x135lbs, 5x225lbs, 3x275, 3x315, switch to mixed grip, 3x315, working sets) which is not much. When I wait for my grip to fail before switching it just doesn't last as long on my main sets.  Are fat gripz really effective?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,depressed_deadlift,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:16:02 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who swears by them, and the one day I tried them my forearms were just rekt the next day. I never really bother with them though as grip isn't the limiting factor.  Do you do any volume days? I generally throw in one day a month of 10 rep sets. Double over for 10x315 works the hell out of the grip, I'm usually barely hanging on by the end.  You could also try changing to hook grip. I have a buddy who uses it and says it feels like you're going to rip you thumbs off at first, but you build up callous pretty quickly."

You could also try changing to hook grip. I have a buddy who uses it and says it feels like you're going to rip you thumbs off at first, but you build up callous pretty quickly.   Tried hookgrip a few times, but my hands are small enough that they don't make much of a difference. My fingers aren't long enough to mash my thumb under my index."
powerlifting,3co8zu,RedSpikeyThing,2,Thu Jul 9 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"From what my quick google-fu says, small hands can be a detriment, but shouldn't really be much of an issue until much higher weights.  Yeah, try the fat gripz, or something like that for now. Perhaps push your DO into more of your working sets for a while, even if it means you lose grip by the end. Right now grip is the weakpoint, so work it the most."
powerlifting,3co8zu,DavidVanLegendary,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"Since I pull twice a week (linear progression so far, but I'm ok with switching my deadlift to a weekly progression), what do you think of keeping one session heavy and strapped with some grip work, and the other double overhand (so artificially light) the whole session?"
powerlifting,3co8zu,what_the_actual_luck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"Check bar quality. I have small hands too and remarkably shitty bars with worn knurlings at my commercial gym and basically have to use straps to progress. The bars were also 32mm and stupid stiff which made holding on even harder. Eventually visited a powerlifting gym with whippy DL bars that has aggressive knurling, holding on and breaking off floor was much easier. That said grip still wasn't where I want it to be and mix grip after strapping for so long can feel weird. The former I've mostly resolved by training grip with single hand pull up holds for time."

powerlifting,3co8zu,Fudgms,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:04:23 2015 UTC,Touch and go is a useful overloading tool for paused bench. I would keep it in as a variation until you're approaching a meet.
powerlifting,3co8zu,mikexsweat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:12:20 2015 UTC,It's a good way to train with more weight. You can also do a hybrid where the first or last rep is paused and the rest are touch and go.

Been working on stretching my hips, glutes, and hamstrings but I'm not sure if that is what I should be doing.  (Mods if this violates the rules let me know and I'll delete this bit in an edit)  I get a weird pain in my lower abdomen when squatting with a belt. It's a very sharp pain, but it's only while squatting and it's only with a belt. Had it happen last night and did the same weight belt less and no pain. The weird part is it isn't where my belt is. It isn't in my groin which would indicate a hernia. Just bottom of my stomach. Don't know if it's fat getting pinched or what."

I know some guys who did Madcow with single ply benching, and they usually did some shirt work if they were up to it after the heavy bench set at the end of the week, so that could probably work for the Texas Method as well. Don't expect many reps in the bench shirt, especially if it is a good shirt. Good luck in your training."

It's going to be more about adjusting technique/skill work than strength gain.

Its awesome how I go to sports magazine sections and there is nothing related to the sport i love but there is a wealth of information on abs in 6 weeks and how to get big biceps with Mr Olympia's routine. Id hate for more people to publish information on how to get better at powerlifting or have other quality equipment manufacturers focus on equipment and training products for us. I'd hate for the world best be able to make money off of what they're good at so they can continue to be better.

powerlifting,3clcah,acewolk,0,Wed Jul 8 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"Heres my reasons why I don't want it to be popular. It doesnt have anything to do with elitism or ego-pumping etc. Its because there's a lot of mis-information and BS surrounding bodybuilding because it's super popular. If powerlifting gets that popular, I BET that the powerlifting mags will have a lot of broscience and lies trying to sell supps. Thats why I dont want to see it become mainstream (this is not the same as not wanting it to thrive)  What I do want to see about powerlifting is that it gets included in the olympics, and people 'know' what it is. I don't want it to be something that ""cool people"" do if you know what I mean"
powerlifting,3clcah,uwootm8,13,Wed Jul 8 23:31:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit more to due to the fact body building was popular when there really was no science involved with fitness.

Also the everyday person interested in ""bodybuilding"" eats that mis-information, headline popping, magazine title up, so that's what they cater to."
powerlifting,3clcah,ghoulmaster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say it is more because you need to fill those magazines with content. It is pretty difficult and therefore you will get hundreds of different articles on how to build your biceps.  And in my experience power lifting training is not really based in science, in fact most science when it comes to strength training sucks. People tend to select programs that some trainer or successful power lifter have created based one experience."

powerlifting,3cmmfc,flannel_smoothie,9,Thu Jul 9 02:31:01 2015 UTC,"Could be worse, I initially thought it would involve somehow sitting on the box while deadlifting in some sort of strange deadlift/box squat hybrid."
powerlifting,3cmmfc,Catechin,3,Thu Jul 9 03:32:18 2015 UTC,Westside barbell do that exact thing but normally off a chair instead of a box.  They do two partial lifts followed by a full deadlift.

powerlifting,3cmmfc,flannel_smoothie,4,Thu Jul 9 13:20:18 2015 UTC,That doesn't make sense if he's not lowering the weight below what would be the floor. Maybe he's just got a Napoleon complex.

powerlifting,3cmmfc,delph,7,Fri Jul 10 03:25:34 2015 UTC,When I saw Koklyaev he was leaning back against the box much harder. Don't think that a bench is a good idea unless it's against a wall.
powerlifting,3cmmfc,connorskific,5,Thu Jul 9 04:50:29 2015 UTC,I attended Misha and Boris' seminar. So much useful information these guys gave during it. Was supposed to be 6 hours but ended up being 9 hours so they could go through all topics. I remember him demonstrating this exercise actually. He did it with a box that was touching a wall.

powerlifting,3cmmfc,KaKTy3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's just there to keep form strict. Something similar is to RDL next to wall, position yourself so your ass brushes the wall when the bar is on the floor."
powerlifting,3cmtq8,Shrimp_n_White_Wine,6,Thu Jul 9 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"Never lose plates again.  But seriously, Lock Jaw Pro.  I know a couple people who use the standard ones, and supposedly the pro are noticeably stronger.  There's also an elite variation that's probably unnecessary mandatory."
powerlifting,3cmtq8,Catechin,4,Thu Jul 9 03:35:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. That's much more affordable than what I was looking at. Always seem to forget amazon when it comes to gear.
powerlifting,3cmtq8,HPPD2,5,Thu Jul 9 03:49:34 2015 UTC,Yeah those are pretty good general purpose collars and should be fine. I've also heard very good things about the OSO collars which are probably better. Lock jaws can still shift a bit on deadlifts and can be annoying but you won't dump any plates like spring collars.  It you want the absolute best training collars Ivanko Cot-1.25 or Cot-2.5 are it. Just as strong as the ivanko and eleiko competition collars but smaller.
powerlifting,3cmtq8,HPPD2,2,Thu Jul 9 13:50:38 2015 UTC,Thanks. Those Ivanko training collars are pretty much exactly what I'm looking for.
powerlifting,3cmtq8,Daveuall,3,Thu Jul 9 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"I own the COT-1.25s, they are awesome. They add 2.5lbs to the bar which can be annoying if you are OCD about even 5lb jumps, but they are light enough to keep in a gym bag and the 2.5lb versions are discontinued and just heavier and offer the same grip on the bar as the 1.25s."
powerlifting,3cmtq8,HPPD2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"Obviously the Eleiko style is #1 but obviously cost prohibitive.  I like the Ivanko competition collars but absolutely hate the Ivank Cot-1.25 collars we have.  We don't use them.  They sit in the bin while we use the Eleikos, comp Ivankos, Lock Jaws, or spring collars."
powerlifting,3cmtq8,Daveuall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"absolutely hate the Ivank Cot-1.25 collars we have.    Are the ones you have beat up or something, any particular reason?

powerlifting,3cmtq8,Gooners85,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:55 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe that's what I was wondering. The 2.5kg comp collars are obviously the best I just don't see what there is to hate about the COT-1.25s unless they are beat up and not working properly or something.

powerlifting,3cmtq8,Vqn1204,2,Fri Jul 10 02:34:14 2015 UTC,What are you squatting where you run out of room on the bar? At least 6 plates..? I can fit 495 on deadlift bar with bumper plates and I assume you're not using bumper plates for squatting.
powerlifting,3cmtq8,Catechin,4,Thu Jul 9 03:59:18 2015 UTC,The plates are pretty wide but it was 625 lbs. I can fit 7 plates but 6 and two tens pushes the collar pretty close to the edge. That + some bar flexion did me in.

powerlifting,3ckc9t,Danneborger,3,Wed Jul 8 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Interesting you say that, I've only just made the same observation! Normally I have my pinkies on the rings, so quite a neutral grip, but given this is a different bar to what I use in the gym I'm starting to think that's why I failed my last attempt. I've never gone wide though as I'm very tricep dominant (albeit I failed that lift so close to the top...)  and I'm 5' 10"" - the tallest person in my class!"
powerlifting,3ckc9t,moldeh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, the pause on the last bench attempt was extremely short too. Press command came so fast that the first time I saw it I thought you accidentally TnGed it.  Also, if you look at your arms [focus on the elbows], when you get to lockout, the bar is more or less straight but your right elbow is higher than the left and closer to locking out. Pause at 1.17 to take a better look.  Not sure if it makes a difference, but it might help you figure it out."
powerlifting,3ckc9t,sacriker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:54:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate, you're right. Even if I locked that out it wouldn't look legit! I think a proper pause may have actually helped as it allows me to keep tighter - especially under that weight.  I was saying this to another chap below about my left arm lagging. I do have a slight injury that only flairs up in certain positions in my left elbow and I think that is the main cause. I now need to figure out how to fix it...."
powerlifting,3ckc9t,Pm_me_boooobs,3,Thu Jul 9 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Oh man -- what happened on the 3rd bench attempt?  Looked like you killed it...then it suddenly stopped.  A lot of people would have been crushed under the 2nd squat attempt.

I think its due to an injury in my left elbow I got a couple of weeks ago from unracking a squat funny, it sort of slipped down on my left side. I wasn't in any real pain but it was noticeable in certain positions and as you can see its my left arm lagging a little."

powerlifting,3cjzxl,kraken514,0,Thu Jul 9 16:59:37 2015 UTC,I assume most of us eat every 2.5 hrs during non lifting times. Add in lifting and where do you think the nutrition comes from during the three hours he's lifting? It's science man.  There's a reason he's barely got a 1000lb total and weighs less than 180lbs. Clearly three hour gym periods aren't helping.
powerlifting,3cjzxl,ex_biloxian,2,Thu Jul 9 17:23:00 2015 UTC,Geez sleeping must be a bitch waking up every 2.5 hours to eat. Seriously show me the research that says going more than 3 hours without food is harmful and that working out during this time is negative. Burden of proof is on the one who makes the statement.
powerlifting,3cjzxl,OmnipotentStudent,-3,Thu Jul 9 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"Aite here we go.   1) My total was 487.5 @ 80kgs back at the end of February   2) My total will very easily be ~520 in 5 weeks, that's 1145lbs  3) Lmao at you thinking I struggle to gain weight. I have to very carefully watch my macros to ensure I don't gain weight. It is not difficult for me to down 2500 calories in a sitting. I am staying in 83 because I don't want to have fatsthetics.   4) I used to train 3x a week for 90-120 minutes. The gains were much more inferior. I have literally made the same gains in half the time, without bulking.   5) I can't lift as much without the longer breaks. On squats, my long femurs makes that shit very tough. 5-10 minutes gets me recovered mentally and physically. No point in rushing and failing a rep. I never fail reps in training."
powerlifting,3cjzxl,kraken514,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"3) if you gain weight that easily your body is telling you something. Listen to it. You could progress a lot faster if you got over this idea of keeping abs. Find your natural set point, then worry about aesthetics.  5) if you aren't failing reps you aren't training hard enough. If you didn't fail you left something in the gym."
powerlifting,3cjzxl,CuriouslyCultured,2,Thu Jul 9 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but if you look at interviews with top people like Coan, Malanichev, Tuscherer, etc; they ALL say you should avoid failure on the main lifts.  They pretty much agree that an occasional grinder is ok as it teaches you to struggle under the weight, but you shouldn't fail, and as much as possible you should use weights where your technique doesn't break down."
powerlifting,3cjzxl,OmnipotentStudent,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:33:28 2015 UTC,"3) I don't have abs. I'm already fat. This is powerlifting, a hobby, not a bloody career.   5) Confirmed idiot."

powerlifting,3cjzxl,kraken514,0,Thu Jul 9 19:23:25 2015 UTC,"I would love to hear the reasoning and science behind extended breaks like that. I'm open to learning. I don't know any powerlifters, and definitely not pro bodybuilders who train that way.  Edit: I understand the breaks between max attempts. I give myself a few minutes between my last heavy set and max attempts.  But that's it.  Warm up sets are less than that.  I can still get 400-450 reps in, in an hour and a half.  I am curious about the spending 3hrs on one gym session because I never see anyone train that way.  Where did that idea come from and what elite level lifters use it?"
powerlifting,3cjzxl,diamondeyes18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:31:49 2015 UTC,"Well I'd sincerely hope no pro bodybuilders train that way. But many powerlifters rest until their muscles are able to hit another set, which for heavy triples or doubles can definitely be 5 minutes."

I've trained with 4 who've been to IPF worlds (3 of which have medaled), and guess what, more often than not they're taking longer breaks.   Some people CAN get away with short breaks. I know a girl with a 440ish wilks who rests a couple minutes between sets, dunno how she does that.   I cannot tell you how many times I've been at a meet and someone says to me, ""oh man I think all this extra rest is making me stronger!"" After they hit 5-10kgs over their PR."

Tier 2 - S/B/D accessory work (OHP, paused squat, deficit deads, for example). Superset these with back work, so if I'm doing OHP I'll superset pull-ups/lat pulldown where as if I'm doing close grip I'll superset that with some dumbbell rows/Pendlay rows, etc. Tier 3 - Bodybuilding shit.

My programming is:  Powerlifting movement (or similar) 5x5  2-4 accessory exercises at 4x8  2-3 more small accessories at 3x12  1-2 complimenting supersets at 3x12

powerlifting,3cjzxl,SleepEatLift,2,Wed Jul 8 17:59:13 2015 UTC,"The way I see it (which may not have a ton of merit), there's really no reason to have long rest periods and things like that with accessory work. I think supersets are great. The ""pump"" itself isn't necessarily the cause of hypertrophy, but in general, if a given muscle group is pumped and sore the next day, chances are that workout could be categorized as causing hypertrophy.   I use supersets myself. Sometimes when I'm extremely lazy/in a hurry I'll use giantsets for stuff like facepulls."

powerlifting,3chayj,Mdisbrow,19,Thu Jul 9 15:07:47 2015 UTC,I've never met a good lifter that didn't have a large back.
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,10,Wed Jul 8 06:02:35 2015 UTC,Totally this. Even the scrawny lightweights usually have some surprising back width when seen from behind.
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,28,Wed Jul 8 10:26:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe you just don't SEE them training back?   Nail on the head /u/coachdubs. I don't know of many high level IPF lifters who don't do a fuck-tonne of back volume. Or any high level powerlifters who don't do a fuck-tonne of back volume.   Basically, fuck what all those stupid beginner programs like SS/SL/etc, do fuck-tonnes of back volume.  Edited to include more fucks."
powerlifting,3chayj,powerliftinglife,3,Wed Jul 8 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"Hey man, where specifically do you find the benefit from back work? I incorporate a lot of upper back work myself, but I've been questioning the transfer to the big three"
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,53,Wed Jul 8 01:52:44 2015 UTC,Keeping the bar tight on your back in squats. Builds mass for bar positioning. Limiting thoracic collapse in squats and deads (the difference between round-backed deadlifting and fucking awful round-backed deadlifting). Bench set-up tightness. Bar control. Looking jacked as shit and wide as fuck and scaring the opposition.

powerlifting,3chayj,itwowsback,6,Thu Jul 9 00:08:35 2015 UTC,The last bullet point is the most important one
powerlifting,3chayj,powerliftinglife,2,Wed Jul 8 03:33:31 2015 UTC,Haha elegant and entertaining as always. Thanks man! Food for thought
powerlifting,3chayj,brb_im_bulkin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:27:45 2015 UTC,This. The more I compete and train the more I realize just how critical a strong back is.
powerlifting,3chayj,kanst,3,Wed Jul 8 16:16:45 2015 UTC,I think because a lot of the lifters post on youtube they post the things people get excited about which is big singles and doubles of the main lifts.  No one is getting excited to watch someone do chest supported rows for 20 minutes. So they edit their videos to mostly show the main lifts and then cut out all the accessory work they do.
powerlifting,3chayj,Dayy-v,47,Wed Jul 8 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of the top drug tested lifters tend to be European, whereas the most high profile untested lifters are American. In Europe, a lot of strength culture comes from weightlifting, which does not put anywhere near as much emphasis on ""back training"" (rowing in particular) as American strength culture does, which has its roots firmly in bodybuilding - hence the emphasis on training the back, and rowing movements in particular. I also think being natty lends itself to more sheiko style training, with high frequency and volume of the main lifts. This is again the opposite of the upper/lower or bodypart split that American lifters have inherited from bodybuilding. Such a training split lends itself much more to back training than the aforementioned sheiko style training of the European lifters."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,36,Tue Jul 7 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"A short (or long) dot point outline of my assessment of this built over time from various sources and accounts, and some of it might not be popular...   Linear periodisation is definitely more favoured in the US and rooted in bb'ing. Whereas European training is Soviet influenced to a large degree. Soviet training based on science (specifically from weightlifting), US training based on bro-science. Literally. Soviet training also far more coach based, less so in US. Numerous studies have shown linear periodisation to be inferior to various other styles of training. Srs. From the beginning there was adifferent attitudes to steroid usage between Soviet and US lifters IMO.  Soviet lifters used them as a supplement like anything else specifically geared towards recovery. US lifters influenced by bb'ing: USE ALL THE STEROIDS!!! Many elite US lifters still use linear periodisation but the majority of them compete in untested feds. I've heard from personal recounts that some dosages are quite epic. Due to immense steroid usage these lifters would be successful on any program and are in fact successful in spite of their programming. Also leads to a tendency for US lifters to be ""more swole"". Soviet lifters train with a high volume from the beginning and need less hypertrophy work because of this.  Elite Sheiko lifters still perform significant amounts of upper back work, likely because total main lift volume is no longer sufficient. Linear periodisation uses less volume of the main lifts (specifically deadlifts where upper back is concerned) so need more bb'ing assistance.   Therefore, being natty benefits more so from high volume training as it is more efficient than linear and produces better gains, whereas epic steroid usage can compensate for shortcomings in programming IMO. Hence if you use linear or have used it in the past you still need fuckload of extra back volume to compensate for current or past programming inadequacies. Basically do powerlifting progression with bodybuilding assistance.  I'm basing this on a large amount of personal observation, anecdotal evidence and assumptions made from limited statistics however.  Edit: also apologies as its a bit rushed, I do need to clarify a few points better."
powerlifting,3chayj,gzcl,13,Wed Jul 8 04:15:09 2015 UTC,"For your whole effort in this thread I commend you.   This shit right here, exactly:    Basically do powerlifting progression with bodybuilding assistance."

powerlifting,3chayj,Benxbec,2,Wed Jul 8 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Do squats/benches/deadlifts then follow it up with bodybuilding stuff like OHP, close grip, rows, leg press, etc."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:42:55 2015 UTC,High frequency of the main comp lifts with decent periodisation principles and bb'ing assistance.   BIG AND STRONG
powerlifting,3chayj,Dayy-v,7,Thu Jul 9 00:58:58 2015 UTC,This is a much more detailed and better explanation of what I was trying to say above.
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,5,Wed Jul 8 09:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think there is some speculation to be made as to how some highly dosed US lifters would do with better programming. I have read a few people suggest that they ""need less"" specificity due to the chemically enhanced recovery and as such can focus on more mass development but I believe that the chemicals just compensate for less efficient programming and that with better programming they could be lifting at exponentially greater levels."
powerlifting,3chayj,Dayy-v,3,Wed Jul 8 14:33:41 2015 UTC,I know that PEDs increase the time of muscle protein synthesis from something like 24 hours in natties to a week in enhanced lifters.
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,2,Wed Jul 8 16:18:09 2015 UTC,And I know that a lot of geared lifters place a lot of emphasis on 'recovery' with their linear templates but I speculate if they used a different methodology such as Sheiko where you accumulated fatigue then super-compensated then their enhanced compensation potential would be mind blowing...
powerlifting,3chayj,Dayy-v,3,Wed Jul 8 16:25:53 2015 UTC,I agree. If you look at the Lilliebridge method the volume on main lifts is pathetic. I don't even know how you get a training effect from a heavy single once every two weeks.
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,3,Wed Jul 8 16:32:51 2015 UTC,I was actually going to mention them specifically but decided to be more diplomatic and not name any specific lifters and their programs... but if you're going to bring them up first...

powerlifting,3chayj,Crocune,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:52 2015 UTC,So based on your posts in this thread I'm guessing you despise 5/3/1. Or would you consider high volume and low frequency of BBB to be acceptable? What would you think I should be doing instead? I can't really imagine progressing much faster on my bench or squat at this point. But I really despise the idea that I could be making faster but equally sustainable gains :/
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,3,Wed Jul 8 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"If you think I hate 5/3/1 you obviously have not checked my recent post history or seen me post anywhere before. The original 5/3/1 is limited, and furthermore not written for powerlifting, but many variations have come since that I definitely approve of. Of course there are even more optimal programs out there but if you find something that fits for you and you are making gains then stick with it.   Also read here."
powerlifting,3chayj,Crocune,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"I see this all the time but always wonder: what's the idea behind 3/5/1 instead of 5/3/1? I'm hoping to break that 1400lb barrier in the fall, but I'm pretty much depending on my bench to get me there lol"

powerlifting,3chayj,Jag28,8,Wed Jul 8 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know about European training, but I know that Asian weightlifters do emphasize back work. So it's not a weightlifting thing, but possibly just a weird European thing."
powerlifting,3chayj,chancetheslacker,4,Wed Jul 8 01:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say that MORE (but most definitely not all) top natural lifters follow programs with more specificity, which in itself means less accessory work (back, anything not S/B/D). Look at Ben Rice, Layne Norton, Brett Gibbs, Josh Hancott, Bryce Lewis, Candito. These guys seem to use programs that emphasize specificity. Why this is more prevalent among natural lifters is another topic."
powerlifting,3chayj,ian92293,3,Wed Jul 8 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"You pretty much listed all the guys I was thinking of. I'm just not sure why they train so differently from drug users. I understand that things like intensity, volume, and frequency would be influenced by drug use but I can't see why exercise selection would be."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,-5,Wed Jul 8 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"Natural lifters aren't able/trying to build as much muscle as enhanced lifters, so specificity is just more effective for them. Edit: I meant THOSE natural lifters"
powerlifting,3chayj,ian92293,17,Wed Jul 8 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Seriously, total bullshit.  Edit: and fuck your downvotes too, I'll expand on it why its bullshit.  Geared and natty lifters can and do train exactly the same, geared lifters just have an advanced capacity for progression and recovery. A natty lifter still needs to train with the same intent and with comparative volume and intensity to make good gains. A natty lifter still benefits from increased muscle mass, they just won't get as big or gain muscle as fast.   Specificity is effective for everybody as is increased muscle mass."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,-4,Wed Jul 8 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry I should clarify, I just mean elite natural lifters like those mentioned above are close enough to their genetic limit on muscle that specificity becomes much more beneficial. The same would apply to enhanced lifters (ie Malanichev 'only' does the big 3), but I believe their potential limit on muscle is much higher, making it take that much longer to reach."
powerlifting,3chayj,Teekam,15,Wed Jul 8 04:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'll let you know another bullshit phrase, specifically relevant here...   genetic limit on muscle   Gibbs, Hancott and Candito in particular are juniors or just out of juniors, they literally have decades ahead of them to add mass. And Hancott and Candito are not even podium finish level lifters at an open level yet either. They are only really elite level juniors. Layne may be closer to his limits due to his bodybuilding and I don't know much about the others but when it comes to a lot of elite lifters you can throw genetic ""limits"" out the window.  Hell I'm not even elite and according to the bullshit Fat Free Mass Index I should have an index figure of less than 25 as a natty lifter, yet I gravitate between 27-28 adjusted for height.  Even if Malanichev 'only' does the big 3 (I have my doubts), he sure does a fuckload of them and therein lies your back volume too.  Belyaev under Sheiko did frequent upper back work and he is nearly as wide as he is tall, same as Fedorenko and Podtynny in higher weight classes.   So yes specificity is very important for becoming an elite lifter but progression in other areas rarely stops altogether either."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,4,Wed Jul 8 05:10:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm so tired of seeing the Fat Free Mass Index. It's another excuse generator for people afraid to do the work to gain weight. According to science, I shouldn't even exist apparently.  There's no use talking about genetic limits unless you've been in a plateau for 5 years while still putting in the necessary work."
powerlifting,3chayj,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,5,Wed Jul 8 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"I hope to eventually hit 10% bf @93kg, this will give me a FFMI of 30 and prove that I am Superman.  Actually I'll be happy to just get to ~12-14% but even then my FFMI would be 28-28.5 adjusted for height..."
powerlifting,3chayj,HPPD2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:13:58 2015 UTC,I like the calculator at weightrainer.net much more scientific and you can't speculate on other people unless you have their wrist and ankle measurements.

powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,2,Thu Jul 9 13:00:54 2015 UTC,Is it possible that maybe you're not nearly as lean as you think throwing off the calculation? Everyone way underestimates... I don't think FFMI is a hard rule or anything and I'm sure it's possible to be a bit over 25 natty but still.
powerlifting,3chayj,ian92293,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'm 5'6 and thick as fuck in the torso so I carry a lot of dense mass. I had my skinfolds done weekly up until recently so I'm pretty sure <20% is relatively accurate, and since then I have kept on dropping weight and looking leaner. I have since done a small survey among my fellow IPF lifters (including a few WR holders) and a large number of them are 25 and over as well. One as high as 31 (~14% bf and he gets dexa scans regulary so his is very accurate). Though the scale is meant to be ""accurate"" for anyone <20% for whatever reason it is not 100%.  This article suggests   The above information should help give the resistance trainer perspective on how muscular they currently are and what research suggests is the upper level of muscularity.  A FFMI greater than 25 for men and 22 for women may be achieved without pharmacological help but this does not seem to be common.   So it might be better consider a prediction than a limit but as said it seems quite common for powerlifters to exceed that prediction too. The main point to take away from this is that people should not use these figures as excuses for limiting their aspirations or as a reference to judge others."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"Sure I think all those lifters can still make mass gains, but even the younger ones have been lifting nearly 10 years, which is enough time for them to get somewhat near their genetic limit, at least to the point of making further muscle gains relatively less valuable. The potential gains from neurological adaptations and improved technique, however, seem to be much greater in general. I know I've seen Malanichev doing pull downs before as well as ab work, so I know he doesn't exclusively do the big 3, and I'm sure in the past he's done tons of BB type work. My point was just that, like the other lifters mentioned, that type of training has become less valuable for him over time. I don't really subscribe to the FFMI either, but that's pretty absurd for a natty, how tall are you if you don't mind me asking? I'm currently 165 lbs at 5'7 (read: weak) and a 27 FFMI would put me at almost 220 which just seems inhuman"
powerlifting,3chayj,ian92293,2,Wed Jul 8 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"Sure I think all those lifters can still make mass gains, but even the younger ones have been lifting nearly 10 years, which is enough time for them to get somewhat near their genetic limit.   Nope.  I'm 33 and have been lifting for around 18 years and carry around over 80kg of lean mass. I've been cutting weight back to the 93 category but still my legs, arms and chest have grown with recent extra bodybuilding work focusing (I've doubled my squat volume and have been working on filling out me bench shirt better to make up for any fat loss. Fat went down, muscle went up. I know drug free 40 year old blokes who have been lifting for decades who are still steadily increasing muscle mass. Its just hard work, pre-set genetic ""limits"" are bullshit. And junior lifters are nowhere near their limit, you will begin to pack on extra mass just with age (I call it man-size - from the age of 23-24 I thickened up significantly).  I'm 5'6 at under 97kg (213lb) currently, last year I was up 103 (226lb). I also like backwork...  Gibbs himself is shorter than me and significantly leaner, just speculating that he's 5'4, 190lb and 15% outside of competition that still puts him at 26.9... and he will eventually lift as a 93 I'm pretty sure."

I've been doing pretty heavy volume attempting to bulk up myself but it just seems to go so slow already, and I've only been lifting a few years. The thought that I can potentially gain another 60+ lbs is actually really motivating, so I appreciate the all the insight"
powerlifting,3chayj,Benxbec,4,Thu Jul 9 02:39:39 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference: The top drug tested lifters, beyond a small handful of American guys and 1 or two Oceania guys, don't show you anywhere near the full picture of their training.  I've been following Konavolov for years and here's what I've been able to gather: He does long pause squats.  That's it.  Its like that for most of the top guys/gals up there they don't upload hardly anythingto social media  These guys compete against others.  There's no easier way to get a leg up than watch your rival's youtube and know what he's doing.  Secrecy is key when in it for the placing"
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,9,Wed Jul 8 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"I think that generally IPF lifters spend more time doing the big three and close variations to perfect the movement while untested lifters do more bodybuilding exercises and allow the muscle to play a bigger role in relation to technique. Most IPF lifters are better in a technical sense because it is a necessity. They can't add much more muscle like those on PEDs so they resort to perfecting the skill of squatting, benching and deadlifting. Obviously there are exceptions to this as with any generalization but it's something that I keep noticing."

The lats are not a primary mover in the bench press, they are a very important stabilizer and work hard on the eccentric of a bench press. However the only point during the concentric in which they could help is when your humerus is behind the plane of your body (or at least this is what I've been told by people who have much better anatomy knowledge than me)."
powerlifting,3chayj,GeneralMillss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:38:51 2015 UTC,I agree with you and that would make sense. Why it doesnt I honestly dont know.  One thing I noticed is when I started doing 2x the amount of rowing compared to amount of pressing my bench went up. That could be just me but ?

powerlifting,3chayj,Benxbec,10,Wed Jul 8 21:24:50 2015 UTC,Dude... The lats originate as low as the pelvis and insert at the humerus. They're one of the largest muscles in your body that is responsible for doing so fucking much there is no fucking WAY they're overrated.
powerlifting,3chayj,gzcl,7,Wed Jul 8 00:42:46 2015 UTC,WOW THIS. They're really one of the most important muscles I can think of. For all three lifts I purposefully think of tightening my lats.

powerlifting,3chayj,kleurplaay,5,Wed Jul 8 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"The upper back is probably just as important if not more so in that it holds a lot of the lifts together, it is a major stabilizer for the whole lift, or the whole sport I'd go as far to say."
powerlifting,3chayj,Benxbec,3,Wed Jul 8 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"No shit, but I hope people aren't so retarded that they think that working their lats is more important than their quads. After doing the main movements and close variations of them, the lats should be one of the things you focus on."
powerlifting,3chayj,BenchPolkov,-3,Wed Jul 8 01:14:21 2015 UTC,but I hope people aren't so retarded   I wouldn't go as far as to call them retarded but yes I see people overestimating their importance on a regular basis.  You just went from 'one of the most important muscles' to 'one of the things you focus on after doing the main movements.' Those are two pretty different statements.

powerlifting,3ci3ql,I_love_bearss,8,Wed Jul 8 02:11:13 2015 UTC,"Garrett Blevins does a great job explaining the principles here, and gives insight how to best maximize your peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggmiPH5y3F8  Give it a watch. Definitely worth the 11 minutes."
powerlifting,3ci3ql,delph,4,Wed Jul 8 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"There are no concrete rules. Basically, you ramp up volume throughout your peaking cycle, and then you begin reducing volume in the weeks leading up to the meet (how many weeks out depends on how advanced you are, beginners probably only need a 1 week taper, while an advanced lifter may need 3-4 weeks of tapering). The amount of actual sets and reps you are going to be doing depends on what your normal training looks like when you aren't peaking for a meet."
powerlifting,3ci3ql,jdub129,3,Wed Jul 8 02:19:53 2015 UTC,"IMO for a peaking cycle you want to do two things: 1. Ensure that you're well rested with little to no residual fatigue going into your contest. 2. Ensure that you're proficient with the competition lifts. This proficiency is why people make quick gains on things like Smolov or squatting every day.  To accomplish these two things (which are somewhat conflicting) I think you need to do the following: 1. Practice your competition lifts regularly - so do heavy singles or perhaps doubles of squats, benches and deadlifts. 2. Reduce your overall volume lifted - so cut most or all of your assistance work. Also cut variations of your competition lifts or switch them out in favour of more of the competition lift (i.e. don't do safety bar squats for sets of 6, instead do more regular squats for low reps).  In general, I think people often avoid lifting heavy for too long before contests. Lifting heavy is somewhat of a skill and people often have shaky lifts on the contest day if they haven't practiced their technique under a heavy load recently. You'd never see a golfer avoiding the driving range for two weeks before a big tournament. Obviously golf isn't as difficult to recover from as a heavy deadlift but the point is still somewhat valid. You also hear people give advice about cutting out heavy lifts while keeping the assistance stuff in. IMO that is the exact wrong thing to do."
powerlifting,3ci3ql,OBoile,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"Can competitors elaborate how much they get out of a peak or how it relates to everyday strength? I think I've only properly peaked once, by accident after a ruinous cycle of smolov jr where constellations aligned and I hit 60lb PR on squat and deads. Took a couple weeks of after to travel, seemingly lost most of the gains. Ran Hepburn for  close to 8 months before inching close to those numbers again. I can't imagine the strength difference being that large."
powerlifting,3ci3ql,platemath,3,Wed Jul 8 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"Kind of hard to gauge because most people probably wont be doing singles when they're not in the peaking part of their programming.  I plugged in some numbers from different days of my training 1-2 months ago into the EXRX 1RM calculator and it estimated my maxes at around 480/320/550 consistently, in my meet on the weekend I hit 507/353/606. So not sure if that's any indication of peaking or just that 1RM calculators aren't accurate."
powerlifting,3ci3ql,treppy,2,Wed Jul 8 03:12:44 2015 UTC,Have a read of this. You're probably looking at around a 3-5% increase from the taper.

powerlifting,3ch4zp,gnuckols,3,Wed Jul 8 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"Good read. Along with Perryman's eBook. /u/gnuckols put pen to paper on some stuff I'd been playing around with in my head but hadn't quite set up properly.  Personally, HIHF as a 4-6 week block is a nice break from my usual high volume and lets me kind of ""mentally reset."" I've lifted 20 of 21 days and set a bench/squat/ohp PR on 17 of them (16 squat PRs). Lots of variations, very few of those are the competition movement. Working volume is down to about 33-35% of my usual week.  An unexpected benefit of tracking all this data is the relationship between my lifts (squat/bench variations). My highbar & fsquat are 95%/82% of my lowbar squat. In those two lifts a belt only adds 5%/3% respectively. Lowbar gets about 10%. My paused HB/FS maxes are within 5% of their conventional maxes. If you're of an analytical nature at all, this is all very interesting data with which to plan future blocks of training."
powerlifting,3ch4zp,tiphiid,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:44 2015 UTC,I love it.  This style of training leads to a near addition of squatting.  I don't feel complete if I go a day without hitting my minimum.

powerlifting,3ch4zp,HonkyTonkHero,2,Tue Jul 7 21:46:41 2015 UTC,Hepburn singles only very slightly improved by deadlift and bench while my squat stagnated and went down. I also felt dead half the time and would dread workouts sometimes.   I've made much better progress running sheiko cycles. 500-600 deadlift on sheiko/LP has taken less time than 450-500 on hep.

powerlifting,3ch4zp,DankestLlama,2,Tue Jul 7 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"I would tend to agree with you.  Last Summer some of my front squat sessions were the following:  example workout 1: 355# for 10 singles  example workout 2: 340# for 20 singles  example workout 3: 335# for 25 singles  While they helped me nail down technique, and get used to lifting heavy weights (my max at the time was 395# front squat) I would have been better served to do for example 355# for 3-4x2-3.  What I did with all those singles was indeed sub-optimal...the number of sets/singles is mentally-exhausting.  However, doing a handful of heavy singles some times can be fun.  eg. 6-10 singles at and above 87.5%"
powerlifting,3ch4zp,barryjerry,4,Wed Jul 8 04:12:45 2015 UTC,25 singles?  That seems a little counter productive - if the intensity is low enough to do 25 then it's not really challenging technique enough is it?

The sessions are very manageable, but the gains could just be from technical improvements. On a bulk, I felt like a slacker doing Hepburn, it worked but was suboptimal compared to the gains from Sheiko. I want to emphasis that focusing on low reps has failed my poverty bench hard. We have similar bodyweight and total but I bench significantly less. For some reason Hepburn works well on every compound lift, including upperbody exercises like press, push press, dips, pull ups, just not bench ¯_(ツ)_/¯."

Also, I went through a few years in college of being a bench bro. All the volume really developed my chest and made me fairly strong while I neglected my legs. I didn't know much about fitness at the time. Only what I learned from off season football in high school and I really just wanted to look good in a swimsuit.  Finally, genetics. I've always had a very large chest. Even before I got into lifting. Bench has always progressed for me a lot easier than other lifts. I for a while benched more than I squatted."

I also think he's pretty highly respected for making videos where he goes back and explains why he was wrong on another video.

Do you do sets ramping up to your max somewhere else, then come out and hit your rep?  Also how do you decide how much you are going to go for?"

Do you do sets ramping up to your max somewhere else, then come out and hit your rep?   Yes. There are benches, racks, or platforms off to the side where you warm up.   Also how do you decide how much you are going to go for?   My first attempt is something I can easily do for 3-5 reps.  It should be non taxing on your CNS and essentially be your last warmup set.  The second attempt is something about 10-15lbs under my best gym PR, and my third attempt is a PR attempt."

What I do is 5 reps at 50%, 3 at 60% then 1 at about 80% of the old rep for mental reasons and then I throw on a new weight. For that new weight I never go at or a few pounds below my old 1 RM."
powerlifting,3cf7qr,megatron81,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:19 2015 UTC,This is how I would approach it:  45lbs - 20x2  95lbs - 15x1  135lbs - 10x1  185lbs - 5x1  225lbs - 3x1  265lbs - 1rep  attempt PR
powerlifting,3cf7qr,kraken514,7,Tue Jul 7 14:54:28 2015 UTC,For a test day that is a little too much volume.  I'd suggest singles only after you reach 50%.
powerlifting,3cf7qr,megatron81,3,Tue Jul 7 15:14:11 2015 UTC,All of these sets calculate at well below his 1rm.  The only taxing rep should be the 265 before he attempts a PR.  The rest is all to warm up the muscles.
powerlifting,3cf7qr,Smartless,5,Tue Jul 7 15:20:14 2015 UTC,I've found that singles over 50% works well on test day because it allows me to get a better feel for how the day is going to go. Plus I don't really see point in doing extra volume once you've warmed up. But what works for me might not work for others.
powerlifting,3cf7qr,Newfoundlander_709,2,Tue Jul 7 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"Get your calculated 1rm. Warm up with sets of 3-5 until you're at 80%. Then do singles with a 10% increase until you're at your calculated 1rm. Then increase by 2%-5% for each lift after you hit your calculated.  Rest for 3-5 minutes between sets on all sets before 80%, and 5-8 minutes on all sets after. Just don't let your cns go cold when you're resting."

Sheiko is a lot more volume, but most of the additional volume would be in the 50-70% range. I've never put in much work in that range, so I'm unsure how much more fatigue there will be to manage.

Observe what's going on to get a feel for the flow of a meet, be sure to watch how lifters warm up and prepare, pay attention to attempt calls and timing.

I was running Sheiko 4 day (CMS) for a while, and the deadlift volume on a weekly basis was literally going to kill me.  I'd almost always have a training hangover after deadlifting days.  The 2 days a week of DLs was getting to be  too much so I switched to DLs 1x/week with no other major lifts (just DLs + 1 variation, with DL/back accessory work) and it seems to be working better for me.  Of course, it might have just been too much accumulated training fatigue, but I'm too inexperienced to figure it out for my Tard self.  My biggest question is, would it be stupid to decrease the volume of DLs on 4 day CMS program?  Squats and bench have always been easier to recover from but deadlifts not so much."

Im considering uping the volume in a major way but dont want to hinder my strength gains by messing up the program.

powerlifting,3cf7qr,Catechin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Im not sure, ill have to check it when i get back to the house. If it helps its jist the cookie cutter 4 day program from his website, its also a four month program."
powerlifting,3cf7qr,TheHispanicPanic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:25:53 2015 UTC,"I just want to tag this here as your comment sounds like this is unclear.  Over time, volume (over all load) must increase to keep progressing.   When you first start you do poundage of 1000 a week (lets say). Your reap the gains. Then you tweak intensity where you might still end up doing around 1000-1200 of load a week but higher intensity. Reap the gains. After a while you will need to slowly progress and do 1500 or 2000 a week and vary intensity, frequency to reap more gains.  Volume ultimately means tonnage or overall load moved.  Sheiko uses a clever periodisation where load is spread out into multiple training sessions to ensure the athlete isn't doing all the work in one day yet volume (overall tonnage) is high. This volume varies over time as you follow his various programs depending on the purpose of the training cycle. There are beginner cycles that are now published on his website however you need to be clever about using these."
powerlifting,3cf7qr,LabRat3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"I understand this but i don't feel like the intensity is really moving that much, at least not from what ive seen. At the beginning of the program most squat days were squat bench squat but now that im a good portion of the way through it seems that the vast majority are bench squat bench with only 4 sets of 2 reps at 80+% of my 1rm"
powerlifting,3cf7qr,Onsager,2,Tue Jul 7 17:58:55 2015 UTC,"Saw an article on the sub (don't know where exactly and I'm on mobile), but sheiko is a guideline and will vary by the individual.   What I do is, if something doesn't work for me, I change the exercise but keep the muscle group. For example I pull sumo or do stiff legged deadlifts because the good mornings weren't really doing anything for me. I've also been adding a lot more volume and some sling shot work on my bench after my workout.  Just do the days workout then hit the squat rack and do what you want."
powerlifting,3cf7qr,alphadicksquad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:56:00 2015 UTC,"I felt the same problem that you mentioned. Little sense of progression in weights however the idea is that you are adjusting your maxes if you happened to hit a 105% on the day that it is prescribed to attempt that.    I tweaked my Sheiko when I was running it then once I have finished my cycles and measured progress I liked what I have gotten however I do not follow any of his protocols anymore. I do it myself ""cleverly"". I learned a lot from running Sheiko. Learned to treat training as sport-practice."

powerlifting,3cf7qr,BlueOmega169,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of wrist curls, reverse wrist curls, those grippy things, and wrapping a rubber band around your fingers and opening them up.  Lots of stretching.  Curls, SMR on your entire arms; you can try to generate some slack for your wrists by loosening up your elbow.  I highly recommend looseish bandages/boxing wraps or wrist braces overnight.  Use wrist wraps for the weights you need to but, in all honesty, outside of bench you shouldn't really be needing them.  If your tendonitis is that bad, you need to focus on hardcore rehab first."

You would run all the same volume level ideally, increasing if you found the first small volume block too easy, or adding higher or lower volumento run an extended cycle, eg. small load 1 (as a post comp deload)>medium load 1>medium load 2>comp."
powerlifting,3cf7qr,d0s4gw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:02 2015 UTC,"I suggest starting on beginner small load to see how you handle it and then assessing from there. If it feels WAY TOO EASY then up to medium load, otherwise stick at the small load for the remainder prep cycles then hopefully move up to medium for the next run.  Use bands or pauses in place of chains. Slingshot will also work but is a better substitute for boards as it creates significantly more overload at the top of the ROM."

powerlifting,3cg5uz,markers920,13,Tue Jul 7 17:33:05 2015 UTC,"When sitting in a chair you're sitting at 90/90.  Your hips ""freeze"" in this position as this becomes their ""end range"" when you don't spend much time going to true end range.  In addition, when you sit, your abs dont' support your trunk and your feet aren't bearing much load.  If they're not firmly down, this can tighten the rectus femoris as it's being tensioned.  Finally, if you're working with your hands, you can bring objects closer to your face, whereas with a screen you can only really move forward and angle your head in the direction of the screen.    WHen you squat down, your musculature is supporting tha tposition, along with connective tissue.  You are still keeping yourself upright and moving around, though.  You're still balancing your own weight.  All this makes it for a ""healthier"" position.  Also, ankles."

powerlifting,3cds8y,andy33ajr,12,Tue Jul 7 03:10:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't start my college's team personally but was one of the founding members. Some random thoughts.  Get to the college and try and get a core group of half a dozen or so lifters who will all train together at the same popular time when lots of people are at the gym.   Try and get some girls on board at the very start. Girls are more likely to join when there are other women already training in your group. Nobody likes a sausage fest.  Talk to your university when you set up the club, sports clubs can get suprising amounts of funding from the administration, we had enough to pay for some transport out to meets.  Try to get the staff in your gym on side. You're technically eating into their margins as people who join your club are people who might buy personal training from them. It's easier when you're all friends, sell it as you're bringing new lifters to the gym.  Think about a club records board, have it on a website or hanging in the gym if the staff will let you.  The club is a huge time commitment, I don't even run the thing and I'm still spending even more time at the gym just working with people.  If you have any specific questions feel free to pm me."
powerlifting,3cds8y,avdale,8,Tue Jul 7 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"Advertise the hell out of your team. Fliers, social media, word of mouth, campus events, whatever it takes! Be proactive in reaching out to other people, and be ready to explain about powerlifting to anyone if they ask (avoid those ums and aahs).  Have something physical you can take with you around your campus, such as a trifold filled with lifting photos and information, or medals/trophies, anything that can grab attention and showcase what the sport is all about will do.  Like /u/avdale mentioned, find ladies that are down for powerlifting or have lifted in the past, as it's far easier to recruit brand new women to the team with that common ground.  It's going to be rough starting out and gaining ground, but keep at it and don't get discouraged! You'll find that a strong core of people can band together to do some amazing work as a team, and it'll make you all that much stronger! Best of luck!"

powerlifting,3ccism,lift_heavy_things,2,Mon Jul 6 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to toss this idea here - have you thought about how tight your adductors are?   Generally when we think of muscular imbalance we only think of the weak muscle but tend to ignore its antagonist muscle. Tight adductors are common and the fact that some of them (gracilis, adductor magnus) also double as hip flexors mean that at the bottom of the squat they may be excessively tight. So while working on strengthening your abductors think about stretching out your adductors."
powerlifting,3ccism,lift_heavy_things,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:48:44 2015 UTC,I think you're right because (I'm not sure if its related) I can't sumo DL because I can't squat down low enough with my legs that far apart. It feels super tight and I can't keep my knees out. I'll try stretching more

powerlifting,3cbunh,psychotheraplst,2,Tue Jul 7 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"Nice post. As to your bench, I think you would greatly benefit from moving your grip in narrower and keeping your elbows in tighter. It looks to me from the far away video that your elbows are flared out even on your opener.  You look like you have the type of build that would benefit a lot more from triceps heavy benching. I do as well. I initially benched with a form similar to yours, dropped the weight and moved in the grip. I am not back up to where I was before, except I no longer have any shoulder issues.  Also I love the depth of your squats and I train going to full depth as well. Maybe to maximize your total in competition you would consider squatting to just below parallel?"
powerlifting,3cbunh,jamesmechanikong,2,Mon Jul 6 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your suggestions.  I have actually trained and competed with close grip, from nov-feb. Initially it ended up beign pain free, and not that much difference in strength even considering the extra ROM, but the shoulder issues eventually creeped into that too. I took a step back, threw on the sling shot for anything over 100kg and worked on shoulder rehab, and that's got me a 5kg bench PB, and 7.5kg competition bench PB. There's still work to be done to get both shoulders to the same stability and strength, but I've already made significant improvements.  I will be implementing close grip a lot this cycle though, but also working on taking my grip out further and getting a higher arch for dat dere cheater ROM for comp.  As for squat depth, I've tried cutting it but it hurts my knees and doesn't let me use stretch reflex, so it ends up being hurty and weaker. I'm going to look at low bar this cycle, see if it's a viable option. Light weight does feel significantly easier, but until I'm mobile enough to bring my grip in it feels very unsteady."

powerlifting,3ca76w,Metallicadpa,23,Mon Jul 6 08:49:54 2015 UTC,The sumo DL is also less suited to beginners because it has a greater mobility requirement   The technical aspect alone is a great reason not to start beginners on it.

powerlifting,3ca76w,Diesel_5x5,2,Mon Jul 6 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"I kinda found this out the hard way. Was conventional deadlifting for a while until I did a Pr of 405. The firm was progressively getting worse as I was lifting heavier, but my ego was pushing form to the back of my mind. I herniated a disk doing that and gave it like 3 months.   So I Started up sumo recently and I found at 6'3 it's just so much more natural of a movement. I can keep solid form and actually tell when I start to lose It. I'm much more comfortable now with going slow and making sure I don't fuck up my back again. It also engages my legs more than before and helped my hip drive in squat.   So that's my random story but I just wanted to share in case anybody may think they have back rounding and never really tried sumo. Turned out to be much better for me (btw my number happened to be 405 I don't think that is necessarily the right number to start or switch over or whatever. Interesting theory though)"

WHAT THE FUCK  And to top it off,  I am no longer one of the strongest at my gym.  Kids ( yes kids in high school) are now bigger and stronger than me.  Yes, they have been on gear while I was gone, its a little too obvious to see, but the fact that my ego is compromised doesnt sit well with me"

powerlifting,3c6nmm,gzcl,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:19:24 2015 UTC,Been going through the exact same thing for going on 4 weeks. Tendinitis right above both knees. Can't squat or even leg press. I recently found that I can do DB stair lunges and forward step ups without pain. If you have stairs you may be able to lunge up them or step forward onto the second step (or whatever object) and back down. Specifying forward because step ups straight up would definitely hurt.  Something to try if you want to keep that ROM working without pain.

Then this week I was just trying to work up to a heavy triple in my deadlifts...and now I strained something else in my lower back. It feels like it just needs a week of stretching and rest.  So now I know I'm a dumbass, but at least I can still train bench. Until tomorrow when I'll probably rip my pec or something. I wish I had someone else to blame haha."

I like taking notes after each exercise, mentioning which set/rep was good/bad, and what I did right/wrong. It has been helping me pinpoint my weakpoints. Sometimes when I'm lifting a weight that needs fraction plates, I'll usually round the weight up, so I have to rewrite some of the weights on my program. But yeah, I think having the actual physical notebook and taking notes during your workout really gets you to think about each set you do."

I got hardly any time to spend with my family and friends, no gym time at all, and it was all commission based work. So when I didn't sell, I didn't earn for that week.

powerlifting,3c6nmm,yoz8ik,2,Sun Jul 5 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had this off and on for the past 2 years. Best things I've found are to warm up very thoroughly and to not be afraid to take a deload week if it's getting bad. Nobody likes deloading, especially when things are progressing well, but what's a week compared to months recovering from a pec tear? I've torn mine being dumb and going too heavy too often so I can tell you: back off if you need to. Getting in that one last set, or that one last rep when your pec feels awful, is not worth it.   I've had success switching to a closer grip bench press. I used to always do it with middle fingers on the 81 cm rings. I moved in to pinkies about 1 inch inside the rings. It takes some stress off the pecs, and after 2 or so months of training that I was able to equal my previous wider-grip numbers. Lots of big, strong guys bench closer: see Eric Lilliebridge and Derek Kendall for example."
powerlifting,3c6nmm,MonstarGaming,2,Sun Jul 5 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"1) I'd massage it. If you can, have someone massage it after having heat on it.   2) Get a really light pair of dumbbells, like 4lbs, lie down, and do dumbbell hugs. Essentially flies but keep going past the center of your body and hug yourself. Slow on the eccentric and concentric. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPalxvDNUE (I keep the wrists netural as instructed by my sports physio)  3) Having already weak/impinged rotator cuffs, I found warming them up or doing anything that tired them out would cause myself to strain my pec. I stopped doing rotator cuff work in the gym during a session, and moved it to after the session."

powerlifting,3c6t4z,afuzzywart,2,Tue Jul 7 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"-carb backloading is when you only have carbs at dinner (or pwo), so the rest of the day your meal consists of proteins and fats.  -carbnite is when your diet is consisting of almost all fats and porteins and you're only taking in around 25G of carbs a day. the nite portion of it meaning one or two days of the week your diet is high protein, high carbs and vary low fat. (bios3training on youtube explains this vary well) the cycle typically look like: 5day low carb, 2 days high carb. or Friday/ Saturday high carbs.   you can do it with junk food but its much healthier to do it with ""bro foods"". imo you are what you eat.  -junk foods spike insulin faster (which is good post workout) but also means the carb night will have to be shorter. the opposite with slower digesting and low gi level foods"

powerlifting,3c6t4z,afuzzywart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:38:33 2015 UTC,yeah i agree. i feel that carbnite is good for people who over weight or want to cut weight fast.  using carbs to spike insulin after a workout and eating at maintenance could result in a growth of muscle and a loss of fat if your body is adapted to using fats and ketone as the primal source of energy.

For me I would basically just work out the calories required to maintain the weight I want to be via the IIFYM calculator then simply shift the daily carbs to PWO and get them from a mix of CBL approved sources. I'd skip breakfast and simply have some MCTs and 10g of protein in the morning as instructed.  Then eat plenty of good protein, fats and greens throughout the day but keeping calories relatively low then BOOM results time."

I've been floating between 13-15% bf for the past couple of years and have put on about 20lbs in that time.  You're not going to find a lot of natty guys that aren't going to end up weaker as they get closer to 10% bf. Hanging around the 13-15% range typically is more optimal for strength/weight ratio"
powerlifting,3c3jwf,TheAesir,2,Sun Jul 5 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't disagree with the relevance of high numbers in powerlifting. Still, there's a point to having those wieght divisions. Otherwise why not have him compete at 105?  Apparently, weighing 83 kgs doesn't sit so well with him, he reckons he'll be more competetive in the 74. I don't think there's any reason he shouldn't try it, after all, he can always go back to 83.  Obviously, the comment about his physical shape is your opinion, surely, many will agree with you. Hell, I can agree with it, but that is beside the point. The point is this: someone has a vision, a certain goal in mind, a goal which others cannot grasp, because it does not agree with this ""permabulk"" mentality that so many people suffer from.   P.S.

More often then not, young lifters should be looking to move up a weight class and work on filling out their frame. So what if you're not competitive initially, it gives you more room to progress.   Let's not forget that being too big is detrimental to one's health.   At 5'7, working his way up to 190 absolutely won't be detrimental to his health. He'll likely be more competitive in his weight class, and improve athletically.  Not to mention, gaining weight would likely help his bench."

This might very well be the case, but to me it seems that 83 kgs might have been this stage for Candito, at least for now.    At 5'7, working his way up to 190 absolutely won't be detrimental to his health. He'll likely be more competitive in his weight class, and improve athletically. Not to mention, gaining weight would likely help his bench.   One has to consider that if he's already been forcing his body to get bigger, going even further might not only be difficult, but he also might gain more fat to go along with the muscle (assuming there's no gear involved).   I can't say whether you're right or Candito is, but since the matter concerns Candito I'm gonna go with him and his instinct.  Just to add something to this discussion, I've yet to meet a lifter who's more content and confident with being bigger as opposed to being lean."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,i_was_planned,6,Sun Jul 5 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"Congrats you just met one. That said its definitely a mentality. Guys under 200 are scared to grow. We saw the debate between Paul Carter and Jamie Lewis a few years ago. Once guys figure out that filling out their frame can get them bigger numbers, even while staying relatively lean, they start to get on board.   I tried to do exactly what Candito is trying to do, tried staying in lower weight classes because I was afraid of the bigger lifters in higher classes. Moving up a weight class has already added 150 lbs to my total in 6 months, and likely will add close to that again in Nov. What its worth, I'm drug free, and have maintained roughly the same body fat."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,TheAesir,5,Sun Jul 5 13:18:32 2015 UTC,"It's worse with strongman. I gained about 30lb over a few months to compete and everyone I train with looks at me weird when I say I'm dropping weight.  I don't wanna walk around all the time at 280lb, fuck me right?"

I know because I used to eat that shit daily and got my bodywieght up to 88kg at 5'7. I then cut for ~6 months and began bulking again. I'm now 84kg and I feel much better than I did at 88kg despite losing only 4kg...  Seriously, it might honestly be what he's eating."

powerlifting,3c3jwf,blacksnake03,18,Tue Jul 14 05:09:17 2015 UTC,"Isn't his 83kg total close to the current 74kg world record already? Yes, dropping weight isn't going to help, but he seems to have fat to drop without losing muscle mass, as well as a lot of time to do the dieting over, which should help with maintaing his strength levels.  Besides, I think he's better off not dropping all the way down to 73kg. He just needs to be in water cut range of the weight class. He might not be a fat-ass, but I think that if he dropped to like 12-13% body fat he'd probably be fine. At the highest level, pretty much everyone weighs more than they actually weigh-in."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,moldeh,9,Sat Jul 4 13:37:59 2015 UTC,Just looked it up and yeah he's apparently 6kg or so off the world record at 74kg. I thought the jump between junior and open would be bigger. Probably a good decision for him then!

Only so much neurological adaption can take place before you need to get bigger to have more fiber to recruit.   And if his total is competitive at the new weight, it doesn't really matter what his bench is.   sure it does. If he's competitive with a crappy bench, he could be winning with a better bench. Chasing total records or meet wins / medals is generally about being a better all around competitor.

Its like when Brett Gibbs walks onto the platform the speakers could just start blaring, ""REKT"" to everyone waiting to lift.  Its actually boggling my mind. Candito is cutting based off of a feeling which probably stems from his terrible diet, and not just from what he weighs and is ignoring all statistics regarding height to weight ratios.  He will not be competitive at all in the 74s.  If anything, I thought he'd be moving up to ~105kg.

But powerlifting is about being strong relative to your weight class, right? So there's no necessary imperative for him to go back up a weight class.  Yes, I get what you're saying about bench. In a perfect world, he'd have a better bench. But again, if his total gives him a better shot in the new weight class, then ultimately it doesn't matter.  But I suppose we'll just have to see. It could be a giant mistake, or he could do really well."

Candito, isn't in that case. As I've stated 100x in this thread, he'll be stronger if he fills out his frame, and more likely than not hit that more optimal ratio of strength to weight.   But again, if his total gives him a better shot in the new weight class, then ultimately it doesn't matter.   again, sure it does. He already has a poverty bench for the level that he's competing at, and bench is the first lift to take a hit when you start cutting."

How do you know what his 'optimal' weight is? He's going to have to give it a shot to find out. You might be right, but you might be wrong. Ultimately he (and his coach) are the best-informed people to make this call"
powerlifting,3c3jwf,Will762,3,Sun Jul 5 19:13:23 2015 UTC,Eh by looking at candito id say his upper body could use some serious mass. Which dropping a weight class is not going to help. His squat and deadlift may not drop much but id bet his bench take a dip. If he loses 50lbs on his current total he becomes less competitive than he would have been in the higher weight class. To be transitioning into me a open with the guys that have been training for decades id be trying to fill out because that's what most guys are doing.
powerlifting,3c3jwf,Mdisbrow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:40:52 2015 UTC,"..you just cannot know this.   If you aren't filling out your frame, you absolutely can know this. Was talking with /u/mdisbrow about my meet prep for Nov last night, and told him I was looking to not cut to 198 for this meet. His exact words were:    Try to fill that class to about 218 if you can. You'll add another 30-50lbs if you can add 5lbs to your bodyweight.   .   You might be right, but you might be wrong.    Frankly the likelihood of me being wrong in this case aren't as high as the likelihood that I am right. He's going to lose strength in making this cut, and its going to affect his ability to compete. He's making a short sited decision, and frankly, its a poor one for such a talented competitor."

A lifter will be qualified for each weight class above the one in which they compete provided they achieve the necessary total for that class. For instance, if a female competing in the open division lifts in the 57kg (125lb) class and totals 295kg (650lb), she qualifies for 57kg class. If however, she totals 330kg (728lb) she qualifies for the 57kg class and the 63kg class.  http://2015rawnationals.purepowerlifting.com/Qualifying%20Totals%202015%20USA%20Powerlifting%20National%20Championships  He will have to compete in another meet before Nationals at 74kg in order to be eligible at that weight class."

I'm also curious to see what he learns from dropping a weight class. He's usually pretty articulate even when he fucks up. Also some of us will never be very competitive and have aesthetic goals that doesn't involve activating mini fridge mode by maxing out our frame.

I mean if you watch further into the video, his excuse for not wanting to gain weight is basically ""I did a water cut this one time, and all the water made me get up to 189lbs and I was uncomfortable."" Everyone is uncomfortable during a water cut, its part of the process"
powerlifting,3c3jwf,TheAesir,4,Sat Jul 4 14:20:50 2015 UTC,What he clarifies is that the water cut was too easy.

Deadlift isn't affected as much by overall bodyweight jumps, but as you're finding out currently its easier to up your wilks when you're filling out your frame better."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,TheAesir,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. There's a relation to body weight and lifts, but it can be easy to get too ""big"" and not have strength match or beat those size gains. I get what you're saying that Jonny might be shooting himself in the foot. And I agree that he might be.   But, the actual sport is based on the wilks score. And because of that there are many strategies to eke out as many points as possible. Losing unnecessary mass can help that. Just look at my most recent meet where I missed weight. Gave me a 472 wilks in the 181 class cause I weighed 166 versus a 446 had I weighed 181. And I know for sure that weight cut boosted my wilks a ton cause I would have totaled over 100 lb more to make the same 472 wilks as a ""real"" 181."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,gzcl,-16,Mon Jul 6 17:46:01 2015 UTC,Haha lol at the downvotes. Didn't mean to offend all the 170lbs internet lifters who focus on wilks because no one gives a shit about their 1500 total. I gotta unsubscribe from this sub holy shit

Right now I'm planning on doing my first meet in September at 205, but I really don't see myself being able to be competitive there. But since I also do masters swimming and track cycling, I'm definitely not comfortable with the idea of moving up to 230+, as it would slow me down a lot."
powerlifting,3c3jwf,astrower,0,Sun Jul 5 10:29:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see anything wrong with this.  In fact, I completely agree with Candito on this one.  Big numbers are nice, but why sacrifice your daily quality of life to lift a few more lbs?  I for one am too heavy to feel good every day, I could definitely feel better and not lose much strength if I lost 10-15lbs."

So last week I posted my initial ideas for prepping for my meet in September, and received some solid feedback.  TLDR again: have a vacation, then a meet 5 weeks after I get back (so 4 weeks of training), trying to program those weeks based off of RPE.  So from the input /u/NikhilT90 gave me, the video he posted, and doing a bit more research I've fleshed out my ideas some more, and created a google doc detailing my planned training: RPE Meet Prep Draft Rev.1  Considerations - Utilizing the RTS slot principle, but molding it into a high frequency approach - Have at least 9 days prior to the 1st day of this with no training (and will likely be jetlagged) - Switching slots to competition movements the closer to the meet - According to meet directors it will be a 2-day meet, so competing on Sunday. No major differences if I have to compete on Saturday. - I had other things I wanted to say that I'm blanking, expect an edit to this comment  I still have about a month to plan this training out, so please feel free to tear me a new one when it comes to this idea or tell me it's awesome if you like it"
powerlifting,3bvdes,135Deadlift,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Looks good man! Two things:  1) you may want to consider squatting and benching on the same day so you get mentally used to benching after squat fatigue. Maybe day 1 is comp squats, comp bench and day 2 is SS bench and paused squats.   2) for your missing tricep movement, board presses would probably be the Mike T recommendation. It'll let you practice your normal grip on a bench but will help overload the tris."

powerlifting,3bvdes,mrgee89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on your current lifts and your schedule. If you can only lift 3x per week then doing a T1/T2/T3 variant each day is fine. Same goes if you're lifting 6x per week you could manage to have two days dedicated towards squat, bench, and deadlift- such would be a high frequency program.   Most people though lift 4x per week with my method and have a squat day, a bench day, a deadlift day, and an OHP day (sometimes a 2nd bench day).  What matters is that you're getting in weekly lifts in the T1/T2/T3 range for main movements (T1 and T2) and accessories (T2 and T3)."
powerlifting,3bvdes,GuziCowSki,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"I just started training the 3 big lifts by doing StrongLifts in January of this year. Prior to that, I always hit the gym, doing BB sort of stuff. Before starting StrongLifts, my S/B/D was at around 285/250/380. I stopped doing StrongLifts at around the end of March. I got my lifts up to 315/280/415. Since then I have competed in a mock meet at my university in late May, I hit 335/300/450. I did well at the mock meet at 166lbs, and as a result that made me want to take powerlifting more seriously. I wasn't sure how to program, and I just looked online. I ended up choosing to do the Sheiko 29-31 blocks. Currently, I am approaching the end of the 29 block. It has been exhausting and fun. But I am not sure if this is the right approach for programming. I know squat is my weakest lift, and I can't tell if I am actually progressing fast enough. I am starting to think that the Sheiko blocks should be used when my progression slows down/steadies more, and when I have an actual meet to peak for. I was thinking that maybe I'll just finish up the block, and find another program that can maximize my noob gains. I can really use some advice with my programming. tldr; just started training powerlifts in January 285/250/380->335/300/450, wondering if doing sheiko is a bad idea since I'm still progressing kind of fast. what program should I try to do instead?"
powerlifting,3bvdes,BenchPolkov,2,Thu Jul 2 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"Might be worth trying out a weekly progression like Madcow or Texas Method for at least a couple months to see if you can still take advantage of some noob gains. I did TM following StrongLifts and got probably 4 or 5 months of progression out of it. If you do go that route, track down the 70's ebook on TM - it helped me out a ton."

I think I will stick to Sheiko for now... Any idea if its bad to test my maxes every once in a while doing Sheiko? I can't stand not texting my max until the end of the 4 month period...."
powerlifting,3bvdes,mizdachubz,2,Fri Jul 3 17:07:33 2015 UTC,Pushing heavier singles and triples EVERY SO OFTEN is a good way of testing progress and lift has become ridiculously easy its ok to up the max slightly between cycles.
powerlifting,3bvdes,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:07:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a 130lb woman so this probably won't be too meaningful to you, but I'd say 5x5 took me from lifting just the bar (no prior experience) to about 160/90/200 (best guess, don't have my notebook with me). Texas Method took me up to about 200/115/240. I ran both for approximately 4 or 5 months. After that I did a couple cycles of GZCL, so about 8 months there, then Candito's 6 week program to peak for my first meet, and am now doing Sheiko. Current bests are 240/130/300."
powerlifting,3bvdes,GuziCowSki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:26:40 2015 UTC,Do you ever test your maxes during cycles? Those are some nice numbers by the way. What was your experience like with the Candito peaking?
powerlifting,3bvdes,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"Sheiko is never a bad idea really. The 3 day cycles were beginner/intermediate cycles and #29 in particular is a base entry level cycle. And if you've already done a cycle it sure would be a waste of time to toss all that accumulated fatigue away and start something new.   Furthermore it would be ludicrous to toss all the work capacity you've developed aside and move onto a volume-phobic program like TM.  Stick to Sheiko, it will pay far larger dividends in the long run."
powerlifting,3bvdes,mizdachubz,3,Fri Jul 3 12:39:42 2015 UTC,Why use something such as Sheiko when TM (to my knowledge) progresses much faster?  I'm currently doing Starting Strength and the LP squat is fantastic.
powerlifting,3bvdes,iforgettherest,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"He's already started sheiko therefore has already developed a fairly decent work capacity. Going back to shitty LP would probably be counterproductive. Furthermore TM ""progresses"" faster by constantly peaking and recovering but never really builds up any work capacity. It is in fact quite oppressive of volume so in the long run your progression will be slower than it would if you were developing decent work capacity simultaneously. And really it only  seems so much faster because you are PRing every week rather than at the end of a long mesocycle."

Lifts are (in lbs, SBD) 285/185/375 @ 158lbs body weight.  Anyways, I was wondering if something like a PPL routine with weekly progression is doable?  I train primarily for powerlifting, so strength is my first priority, but I also love looking good (who doesn't though?)  Also, if not PPL, could anyone recommend me a good powerbuilding routine that has weekly progression, or maybe just a way to tailor texas method in order to get more size out of it?  I know I could probably just experiment with a PPL and try and progress week to week, but I would just like to get yalls opinion. If anything, I'll just stick to texas method because the strength gains are nice (and are my first priority)  Any advice/help will be appreciated, thanks!"

It's the most detailed spreadsheet i've ever put together and gives away most of the percentages of the Cube Kingpin, hopefully this is alright if not I will remove it.  TLDR; Running Cube Kingpin RTS style, using different lifts that I feel will help my weak points.

powerlifting,3bvdes,Catechin,5,Thu Jul 2 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"Sooooo long story short.  When I was playing football we ignored deadlifts and did squat and bench.  So my squat is pretty decent (525), but I've never realllly deadlifted.  So a few months ago I started building up my back for deadlifts, and moving slowly through things.   Last night I was feeling frisky and decided to do something silly.  Previous my the most I'd attempted in the deadlift was 315 for 3.  I decided I was just going to pull a casual 405 and jumped from 315 warm up and just tossed another plate on....  well it went up just fine. got to mid thigh and realized I needed to lock out my hips..... as I had that realization I noticed I could'nt fucking see anything....  I'd completely tunnel visioned and what I could see was like looking through a brown beer bottle.  How the hell do I keep that from happening.  Cause I'd love for that to never happen again...  TL:DR decided to jump my deadlift max quite a bit... pulled it fine until my brain stopped working and I couldn't see and almost passed out at the top.  How do I stop that bullshit"
powerlifting,3bvdes,Lobsterzilla,6,Thu Jul 2 15:01:17 2015 UTC,This is why sometimes you see a 'spotter' next to someone deadlifting at a meet. Sometimes people pass out.

If I am at the bottom of the bench and it's too heavy, I just don't budge off my chest. The lockout portion I can drive, but getting it off is the problem. Exercises for this? Simply more bench work? My bench progresses so slowly whereas my squat and dead can improve not a problem.  My programming has me doing 3 days for lower and 2 days for benching."

powerlifting,3bvdes,nattybber,3,Fri Jul 3 12:09:27 2015 UTC,I've found hammering lats hard and getting a bigger upper back to help me a lot with the bottom. Just learning to use them properly in the bench has made the bottom more explosive.  Also utilize long pauses and perhaps some Spoto Press.
powerlifting,3bvdes,moldeh,3,Thu Jul 2 15:25:10 2015 UTC,Just learning to use them properly in the bench has made the bottom more explosive.   Would you mind sharing how you did that? I can use my lats consciously when dealing with weights in the 70-75% range and it lets me control the weight but when I go over 75% for some reason I just stop feeling them and I just muscle the bar up. Should I just pile on a shitton of volume at the 70-75% range after my main sets or is there more to it?
powerlifting,3bvdes,nattybber,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:34:47 2015 UTC,"It started to click for me when i made the eccentric a little more controlled and slow. I exaggerated this at first and now found a happy medium. There's a supertraining video I believe with Spoto that talks about this; think about it like you're loading a spring at the bottom.   And yes, lot's of volume."
powerlifting,3bvdes,moldeh,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say bench more often. I make better gains and feel better if I bench more frequently. It allows me to have easier sessions and not have to push my sessions as hard every time and the weekly volume is still higher, with a higher percentage of my reps being high quality.   I made good gains pushing my 2 bench sessions for PRs every week for months [medium-high rep PR monday, medium-low rep PR friday] with one OHP session inbetween, but I felt beat up. Right now, I bench with close to twice as much weekly volume and my shoulders feel so much better.   That said, if you're in the middle of a program and don't want to switch, wait until it's done and re-evaluate. Doing more paused work overall, some close grip work for the extra ROM [kinda like how people do deficit deads for speed off the floor] as well as long pauses and spoto presses like other people said, should help. Exercises aside, try arching more, squeezing as much out of your leg drive as you can and make sure your reps are high quality [touch on the same spot etc].  To be honest, I legit cannot think of anyone that just straight up can't get the bar off their chest when they fail. Everyone seems to fail a few inches off the chest, or at lockout [for more advanced benchers or for equipped]. Maybe that's what you mean? Or do you actually miss all your reps with the bar stuck on your chest right away?"
powerlifting,3bvdes,SleepyPierre,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"I've found that when I look in the mirror and squeeze my shoulder blades to retract (I use the cue ""place the shoulders in the back pockets""), my lats disappear. If I retract my shoulder blades not AS hard and focus on my lats (sort of like flexing them), they come out. Not sure if you can picture that. I try to use my lats as best as I can, but when retracting I feel I put more focus on that and staying tight that it takes away from my lats."
powerlifting,3bvdes,TheAesir,3,Thu Jul 2 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"That's supposed to happen. Bringing the shoulderblades back brings the humerus back and since the lats insert there they shorten.  You're not trying to flare your lats. Keep your scapulas retracted and work on arching your back. That helps because you: reduce the range of motion, the pecs push in an angle that's stronger cause that's how the fibres are angled [which is why you generally dip/decline more weight than you flat bench] and you also keep the bar closer to the 'line' over the shoulder joint.  I'm not saying you should retract extremely ridiculously hard like you're trying to pinch someone's finger because that's more of a beginner cue to keep them from messing up their setup. Only focusing on retraction takes away from depression which is key for arching.  A position with the shoulderblades retracting so hard that it almost causes you actual pain is too much to maintain during a set. BUT, you're still never going to have your scapulas loose enough for your lats to show from the front. Place the shoulderblades in the back pockets is a good cue, but think of it more like 'left shoulderblade in right backpocket and vice versa'. I think that's a better cue to focus on depression as well. Personally I just use my arms to push against the base of the rack and it works well.  Also, to be honest, I think the lats are A BIT overrated for the bench. You can't expect the lats to contribute as much as they would if you were doing something like dips. They still help, but they're not working as hard as, say, the pecs, so you're not gonna 'feel' them as much. Some people will tell you to tuck super hard to use more lats, but you're better off tucking just enough to hit your strongest touch point [which is generally around the xiphoid process]. Your lats WILL activate the lats for some speed of chest, but changing your entire setup just to get a secondary muscle to activate better isn't a grat idea.  Question: How much can you OHP/incline compared to your bench and do your front delts look juicy? What about your pecs? Bottom strength is generally about pec, front delt, lat strength. And it's usually in that order. A lot of people have front delt strength issues so then that becomes a priority, but it's not too often that the lats are really the limiting factor in your bench.   Besides, if you do back work and you hit your lats hard already [im assuming someone called 'nattybber' hits his lats], you'll get MORE lat activation out of your ARCH, than you will out of anything else. You're putting the lats in a better angle to push against gravity. You're better off focusing on increasing your back arch through thoracic mobility work and getting your feet as far back as possible without your butt leaving the bench [heeled shoes help with that a fuckload]."
powerlifting,3bvdes,Catechin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"What a reply! Ill definitely take all of this into consideration. I appreciate your response. I think I was retracting way too hard and focusing too hard on flaring the lats- I think adjustments are neded.  And yeah, my back strength isn't a problem as I can hit mid 400's for some reps, but my bench strength is not up to par compared to that. Front delt work I never hit as I assume my pressing hits it well enough. Does OHP really carry over well into pressing? Physically, yes, chest is a weak point as you can tell from my lift, but it's not like I have a super flat chest either.  I wear flat shoes for squatting (and deads obviously). My ankle flexibility is not tremendously great, but it's not bad. I don't own a pair of heeled shoes, but it would make sense that a heel would help my drive. However, I have a meet next weekend and it's a little late for new shoes for benching. Any recommendations? I do have running shoes lol but that would probably be really silly."
powerlifting,3bvdes,toaster_of_life,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"If it you're in a fed that requires flat foot benching, a raised heel helps. No idea what's allowed, just check your options, I legit have no idea about that. The people that do wear those kinda shoes to bench, usually wear oly shoes with raised heel style shoes.   Do I think OHP carries over well? I think that depends on a lot of things. For me, OHP is naturally my easiest lift, so I don't focus on it much anymore [bench carries over, less so the other way around]. But, if you have weak front delts, it might help. Flat benching definitely hits them, no doubt about that, but whether that's gonna be enough will differ from person to person.  The main reason why I asked if your OHP/incline is weak compared to your bench is that it's more that it's an INDICATION of delt strength. And that's true for incline too. If your incline is way weaker than your flat, then that's usually delt strength lacking.  If they ARE weak, you might benefit from working on them for assistance. I know Garrett Blevins can flat bench close to 500 but he's repping out low 300s on the incline for 5's and he said that working the incline has helped because it's a weak lift for him due to delt strength and that it's helped him get his bench up. Obviously your mileage may vary, you're gonna have to figure it out."
powerlifting,3bvdes,Catechin,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"I've been having some serious problems with my squat.  I can't seem to maintain good form with anything >80%. Mostly, it's my knees coming in and my upper back rounding. Although I've squatted 315 to depth before, I can't seem to squat more than 2 plates without my chest caving and my knees ending up pointing straight forward.  My squat has always sucked compared to my other lifts and I suspect it's partly due to these bad habits.  My front squat doesn't have these problems for some reason and I've considered just dropping back squats entirely since I don't plan on competing any time in the foreseeable future.

powerlifting,3bvdes,MonstarGaming,3,Thu Jul 2 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"As an auxiliary question, would deficit deadlifts work in this situation?"
powerlifting,3bvdes,TheAesir,3,Thu Jul 2 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"not directly to strengthen the lower back. you'll get very sore with deficits, but its due to the crappy start position and bad leverage vs really constructive direct strengthening of the lower back."
powerlifting,3bvdes,Danneborger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"So in this case, would something like hyperextensions or good mornings be good?"
powerlifting,3bvdes,TheHispanicPanic,2,Fri Jul 3 02:08:58 2015 UTC,"both of those, to me work the hamstrings more directly than the lower back.  the lower back (erectors and such) really only support other musculature, so there's nothing I'd recommend to really directly work it. I mean some types of arched and rounded back good mornings more directly work the erectors, but you're also putting yourself at more of a risk.   I'd say any exercise where you're supporting a heavyish weight and relying on your back to be tight and rigid is a good accessory to work your lower back, but it won't be directly and it may or may not have a high risk to reward ratio.  tbh, i'd just deadlift heavy, do some SLDLs and maybe maaaybe some rounded back GMs."

powerlifting,3bvdes,CuriouslyCultured,2,Thu Jul 2 17:45:27 2015 UTC,wow that seems stupid and unnecessary. What their reasoning behind that?
powerlifting,3bvdes,dirty_weka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"/u/Danneborger is wrong. The justification for the no compete in large part is to make a push at being a single governing body of the sport. To do that, they need to effectively put a claim on talent. In most countries (pretty much everywhere that isn't the US), they are the only game in town. But in places like the US, they have a load of competition at both a local and national level. This fragmentation is the reason that the Olympic committee has denied powerlifting into the Olympics, as there is no governing body in the same there is in other sports"

powerlifting,3bvdes,mizdachubz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Been watching videos on the way George Leeman and Eric Lilliebridge pull their conventional deadlift. I noticed that they both do something right before they pull: so how one would ""pull the slack out"" of the bar so everything is tight, they actually seems like they don't do that and they do everything in one big pull. So, it goes like a push off the floor, it then catches, and then they keep pulling. This is different than someone who would get tight and pull the slack out, and then pull from there. It seems like they do one big exert of energy and push through the floor in that way. Very hard to explain, but watch George Leeman do it here from like 1:30-1:32.    Do they do it this way because the type of bar they use? (My gym doesn't have 'deadlift' bars they're just the norm ones so not sure if that makes a difference). Or, is it because of their technique to just drive the shit out of it and it brings power? Maybe other deadlifters do this, I'm not sure, but I've seen it clear with them. If this is the case, I may give it a try tomorrow during my deadlift session. I like the way Eric Lilliebridge sets up with how he sort of sits back into position three times, and then on his third one he takes a deep breath and finally pulls it. I do the breathing thing 3 times too and on my fourth I pull as well, but I want to try to do it how he gets gets into position three times to see if that technique helps. Is this dumb to play around with different set up techniques, or should I give it a go? Here's an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQlO8w6JNcA from 4:02-4:16"
powerlifting,3bvdes,PacMan14918,2,Thu Jul 2 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"I often use the technique Eric Lilliebridge uses, the point is to a) get more air than you could get in one breath and b) repeatedly pull with the hamstrings to get the advantage of the stretch reflex."

It has been two weeks now and the pain persists. I can't even squat anymore. This is what it feels like:   When I go below parallel and bounce up, it hurts. It hurts up to a certain excruciating point when something cracks, and then it's fine the rest of the way up. Pain is at the top (close to quads), and under the kneecap Knee hurts when sitting still too long   Has anyone experienced this before? Is this a serious injury? Should I see a doctor?

You can't make me, I WON'T DO IT.  The weight he's handling in this video is basically baby weight for him, in case the fact that he's able to hold a conversation while pausing it didn't already indicate that.

powerlifting,3bsdab,pendrekky,13,Wed Jul 1 20:00:28 2015 UTC,I used to run a lot but switched to biking for cardio. Now I bike to and from work and the gym (half hour-hour/day) and really enjoy it.  I don't really try to incorporate cardio into lifting. Cardio is just something I do daily for transportation and relaxing. Thinking about it that way makes it much easier and enjoyable for me.

I run a mile a day because I like to be an all around healthy and athletic individual. Let's be honest huffing and puffing after a heavy squat session isn't an indicator of a good cardiovascular workout. I fully plan to be running 3 miles a day within a few months.
powerlifting,3bsdab,KBMonay,5,Wed Jul 1 19:53:18 2015 UTC,I do light cardio with mountain biking or skiing. I like to have a balanced athletic life outside of the gym.  I just don't run because I hate running.
powerlifting,3bsdab,that_tech_guy,2,Thu Jul 2 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"Do you feel like that improves your ability to recover from heavy sessions? Because of the movement of blood, the increase in overall blood delivery capacity, O2 delivery, etc."
powerlifting,3bsdab,markers920,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"I can't say that it helps with recovery for me. It definitely tires me out more, but I wouldn't say that it takes away from my ability to lift either."

powerlifting,3bsdab,diamondeyes18,4,Wed Jul 1 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"I do 25 mins of low intensity (~75% of max BPM) cardio 2-3 times a week.   The idea is if you keep the intensity low enough your legs won't be impacted enough to need more recovery. I feel it helps time between sets, etc.; let's me train more during a given timeframe. I want to reserve all high intensity work for sport-specific work (e.g., lifting)."
powerlifting,3bsdab,zenlift,3,Wed Jul 1 20:42:09 2015 UTC,The idea is if you keep the intensity low enough your legs won't be impacted enough to need more recovery.   Yep. Different energy systems are worked if you keep intensity low enough. So the high intensity system that you taxed from squats yesterday is still in recovery mode when you are running at a low intensity today. Just make sure to keep your HR low (I think I remember Alex Viada saying 75% of max BPM is too high and that 60-65% is best) or you'll cut into high intensity system recovery.
powerlifting,3bsdab,delph,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you alluding to when you talk about ""Different energy systems"" ? Or ""high intensity system""? To my understanding it would seem obvious that high intensity work outs of any kind would be harder on your body and therefore require more recovery afterwards. While low intensity work outs are not as taxing and require less recovery. I don't quite understand what these different ""systems"" are supposed to be instead of just talking about the body as a whole. It's just that I've never heard about it like that before, so if you have any information on this that would be nice."

I am ~195lbs squat is ~355-365, bench ~265, and deadlift is about 440... My PRs are 385,295,and 455 respectively... But I was at boot camp for 2.5 months, so I lost some strength... I run my 2 miles in 12:35... So in a nutshell... It may slow my progression down for getting stronger slightly, but I believe I will be back to my old strength and surpass it with 3-4 months...

I lift 4-5 times a week and do cardio 6 times a week. Usually it's 4 times bike (medium-high intensity for 20-40 minutes depending on how i feel and if it was a squat/deadlift day...this usually means 10-20km...165 average heart rate at 33 years old) and I run twice a week, between 5k and 10k, same average heart rate...taking anywhere between 20 and 45 minutes.

I decided I wanted to keep balance between cardio, decent body composition (not great.. But it is what it is) and powerlifting... So that being said, my powerlifting numbers are awful compared to most here. At 170 lbs, my bench is 240, squat is 350, and deadlift at 410..and I've been barely going up if at all since I started maintaining at 170 two months ago.

powerlifting,3brb9e,Daveuall,9,Wed Jul 1 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"My bench is the worst lift of the three, just cracking over 100 but that's an entire different pile of problems haha"
powerlifting,3brb9e,theNightblade,2,Wed Jul 1 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/Daveuall that you just might be better suited to squats.  Personally, my squat and deadlifts aren't very far apart either (187.5 squat with light wraps, 192.5 DL), and over the last couple of years I've not created any more separation between the two.  I even pull sumo already.  I'm just more suited to pushing movements.  Obviously I'll keep working on deadlifts because I want to become more efficient at them, but I know that I'll never be a great puller.  Give sumo a serious shot for a few months and see if you can leverage your stronger, wider stance to better pulling numbers.  Though I will say that if you are built like me, I have a hard time believing your bench is so low!  TRex arms are great for benching :)"
powerlifting,3brb9e,flannel_smoothie,2,Fri Jul 3 12:02:15 2015 UTC,I'd give it a serious go and try training it for 2-3 months and see what happens.
powerlifting,3brb9e,ViraRohirrim,2,Wed Jul 1 14:57:49 2015 UTC,Im hesitant with it since I have a fairly large meet coming up in two months time and I don't want to be in the middle of transitioning between the two styles and have to start my meet prep.  One less thing to worry about going in that's all.
powerlifting,3brb9e,ViraRohirrim,2,Wed Jul 1 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"Going with sumo may give your deadlift an initial boost. But as you say, your conventional is ""weak"", thus going away from the movement and going with sumo might actually make it worse. If you make sure to keep pulling conventional aswell and using sumo for meets/prep I think it may work out very well."
powerlifting,3brb9e,kraken514,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:00:57 2015 UTC,You're suggesting that I go with training in conventional and prep in sumo?
powerlifting,3brb9e,theNightblade,8,Wed Jul 1 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"Practice how you play, if you (are thinking of) compete sumo, train sumo, especially meet prep. However dont throw away yhe conventional all together. Find a nice sweetspot that works for you to train with both. I think it was Dan green who once said: train both, compete using the strongest. And who are we mere mortals to ignore the Dan. Also in your other reply you mentioned you have a meet coming up in 2 months, for that I would advise doing this meet using conventional and start adjusting to sumo after that meet. Good luck."
powerlifting,3brb9e,ViraRohirrim,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:12:58 2015 UTC,Yes. Train both but prep with what you're stronger in. Or if you have heavy and light days the heavy day should be your meet stance and light days should be the other.
powerlifting,3brb9e,theNightblade,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:45:34 2015 UTC,"Could easily work around not training conventional and still get your back stronger with variations.  Stiffys off blocks or the floor, snatch grip deads, or just heavy normal block pulls."
powerlifting,3brb9e,HonkyTonkHero,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:06:19 2015 UTC,"Whilst I agree with you, my question to you is: why would u not do conventional over the others?"
powerlifting,3brb9e,HonkyTonkHero,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:09:48 2015 UTC,I don't feel the need to do 2 'primary' movements.  It's too taxing for me to pull from the floor all the time after doing it sumo.  All of those secondary movements I still do with a conventional close stance.
powerlifting,3brb9e,adpowah,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:13:32 2015 UTC,What kind of deadlift frequency/volume have you been doing?
powerlifting,3brb9e,intbrandon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:09:08 2015 UTC,Once a week heavy with another session a week as a variation (this program is deficits because it's the weakest point).  Normally they are opening the workouts when I am freshest and can concentrate properly
powerlifting,3brb9e,kackwotz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:32 2015 UTC,getting in extra volume at a lower % usually helps me get through a sticking point
powerlifting,3brb9e,kackwotz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:47:38 2015 UTC,I don't have a sticking point so much as it either comes off the floor or it doesn't.
powerlifting,3brb9e,demetrius_savelio,3,Thu Jul 2 03:23:51 2015 UTC,Then the sticking point is the floor?  Anyways high volume will allow you to perfect your form if it is an inconsistency issue.  Also you could film yourself and compare your misses to your good pulls and see if there are differences.  Deficit deads will help speed off the ground if it is just a strength issue.  I've heard deadlift stance squats can help too.
powerlifting,3brb9e,pendrekky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"The reason I choose to go wide on my squats is mainly because I find it incredibly hard to hit depth with a closer stance squat when the weight gets up there.  Only reason I don't class the floor as a sticking point is just I don't know if I am simply not strong enough for the weight being moved or if it is indeed getting out of the hole thats the problem. It could be both, I am normally fatigued by that point so I can't get a proper grasp on it.  I already have added deficits to the shit show that is deadlift day."

powerlifting,3boczu,megangallagher,10,Tue Jun 30 20:53:16 2015 UTC,Nice job!   What about the water cut didn't work for you? I'm curious to see which tips you followed. I've personally never felt adverse effects from water cuts until I get to the ten pound mark but of course everyone is different.   Also I'll see you in the 63s at Nationals!   (oh and this is Victoria Liang btw)
powerlifting,3boczu,pokingyourcheeks,2,Wed Jul 1 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yo Girl. Thanks so much for the water cut tips. I followed them closely. The week of the competition my weigh ins were too close for comfort and I was extremely nervous I wouldn't make it, so kept calories sub 1400 (lowest I went on this cut was 1700). The lack of food the night before + anxiety + being thirsty made me miserable so I was a hot mess.   The only thing I changed was instead of tapering down water I went from 2 gal/day straight to 1 liter the night before. What do you think about that, I was trying to research tapering vs. cut but couldn't find anything on the internets. Any thoughts?"
powerlifting,3boczu,pokingyourcheeks,2,Wed Jul 1 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed a difference when I cut versus taper.   I think your mistake may have been cutting calories too much. When you only have a week you're not going to be able to eat enough calories to gain significant bodyweight. It'll be the water and lack of carbs that make the difference. I don't cut calories at all, eating lots of meat and nuts the week of and then a power bar or something dense and full of carbs the night before to get some energy in me."
powerlifting,3boczu,Jag28,2,Wed Jul 1 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I was trippin tbh. Thanks for these notes. I was so hungry and anxious so I'll try a water cut without the pressure of a meet to test how much I lose, how good I feel.  Woooooo. So Glad its over."

You seem like a really down to earth person and I appreciate that you don't gloss over the things many women lifters (and women generally) struggle with, like failure, weight and body image, while of course mostly showcasing your training, progress, PRs, etc.   Good luck at nationals!"

powerlifting,3boczu,dubledee87,3,Tue Jun 30 23:55:50 2015 UTC,Are you still on the squat everyday program? I'd love to hear how you changed your programming on a caloric deficit.
powerlifting,3boczu,Teekam,2,Wed Jul 1 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"No way Jose! I'd probably die if I continued doing that in a deficit. I worked with Travis Mash for a bit on a 12 week program, and once I signed with LBEB, I've been working with Brandon Morrison on programming for the past 14 weeks. Its lighter volume and frequency so 3 days a week. Day 1: Squat, Day 2: Bench, Day 3: Deads.   I think it helped me recover a lot more since i was used to training 5-6 days/week."

powerlifting,3boczu,petern1015,3,Wed Jul 1 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"My progress was slow, probably over about 7 months. Here's some quick notes on tricks that helped me and built on each other to create better habits:   1⃣ Went from eating sweets/junk every day to only on the weekends 2⃣ Eventually replaced all sweets ALL sweets with Quest Bars.  3⃣ Took a break counting calories and moved to paleo to clean up my diet and create better habits 4⃣ 4 weeks from today I kept eating paleoish and got back to counting calories 5⃣ Ate A LOT more salad than I have in a long time (basically every night for dinner)"
powerlifting,3boczu,fizzax,2,Wed Jul 1 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"Meg, I saw you post this on your youtube channel summary when you posted that video about eatin'. But, what do you suggest when you already DON'T eat sweets/junk everyday?   I was planning on cutting to 148 (from 165) for my next/second meet, but sets feeling hard in the gym and mental weirdness (wanting to binge all the time) was definitely killing my dieting efforts. Once I opted to officially not cut and started eating to lift, things feel better and my weight is dropping down to a more comfortable range (from literally 165 to 158-160ish).   I already eat pretty clean and would definitely like to compete at 148 sometime next year, so... should I add junkfood into the ol' diet? ;)"
powerlifting,3boczu,mizdachubz,3,Wed Jul 1 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest not adding junk food in especially if you're already having experience wanting to binge. For me once I add in some sugar, my cravings and sweet tooth heighten.   Maybe continue eating normally but track your calories and macros. I'd track one or two weeks now with your normal diet and see where your calories are and what your macronutrient ratios are looking like. From there figure out where you need to be in a deficit with this TDEE Calculator and adjust as you go.   If you want to compete at 148 next year, you have time so take it slow.   Good luck. If counting macros is driving you crazy and you don't like it, know that its not for everyone. I go through waves of liking it. If you hate counting macros, I'd suggest a 100% paleo diet, try Whole30. These are things I've had success with personally FYI, there are other ways but this is what I like."

powerlifting,3bnycz,Danneborger,5,Tue Jun 30 19:07:23 2015 UTC,If you have that much fat you should be able to cut down to the 105kg class without much strength loss.  I cut from ~240 to 200lbs (10-12% bf now). My cut started at the end on February and I hit 200 lbs last week. So it wasn't even that slow of a cut. Adding calories back now.   My deadlift hasn't budged. Squat has gone from 405x5 to 405x4. Bench from 245x5 to 245x4.
powerlifting,3bnycz,foxtrot331,3,Tue Jun 30 19:32:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, how did you go about doing that specifically? What was your diet like? How did you adjust training? Anything else, general tips?"
powerlifting,3bnycz,foxtrot331,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"Training I just need more rest days than bulking. Bulking I have ~3 days off a month. Cutting I have about 6-7. I keep training heavy for the big three, and a little lighter on all my 'accessory  work.' I do bodybuilding style training for everything other than the big 3.  Diet is pretty easy. I started with bodybuilding before powerlifting so I'm used to counting calories/macros."
powerlifting,3bnycz,hotpockets0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks, I'll use those tips"
powerlifting,3bnycz,hotpockets0,3,Wed Jul 1 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"It would probably take around 15-20 weeks to lose that much depending on how much you're losing each week. You should shoot for about 1.5-2lbs loss a week. If you cut too fast you may risk losing more precious lean mass than necessary.   I've cut from 175 lbs (~17% bf) to 158 lbs (~8% bf) over the span of about 2.5 months. During that time my squat stayed relatively the same at 425x1, bench was affected the most going from 305 to 275, and deadlift went up (granted I switched to sumo) 540 to 605.   Contrary to what others told me prior to my cut, which was to keep lifting heavy and cut out volume, I believe you should keep workouts the same as you normally do. From there while at a caloric deficit if you notice any decreases in performance during your working sets (the shit that's more important), you can start cutting off volume from accessories by either decreasing reps or eliminating excessive sets. The key is to keep poundage high enough that it gives your body enough incentive to hold onto that lean mass while burning off your fat. Hope that helps a bit!"
powerlifting,3bnycz,hotpockets0,2,Tue Jun 30 20:17:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks. My only athletic interesting is powerlifting, do you think I should try to get stronger before I cut? Am I too weak or perhaps too young to be cutting?"
powerlifting,3bnycz,Lou__Tennant,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:05:16 2015 UTC,"You can still get stronger while cutting, it's just not as easy as when you're eating a caloric surplus. And I don't think there's such a thing as too weak or too young per se, but I do believe it's best to cut down as much as possible without it being detrimental to performance (i.e. getting sub ~8% bf) and then from there slowly bulking up to avoid putting on excessive fat.

As for drilling, I suggest clamping the belt between two pieces of scrap wood and use a drill press if possible. The wood will help prevent pullup/punchout (keeping the front/back cleaner) and using a drill press will help reduce drill wobble, making the hole straighter and cleaner."

powerlifting,3blzhm,BGabrielx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:57 2015 UTC,The amount of weight I lift. I have short arms and long ass legs so my ROM is ridiculous. I can't seem to get any leg drive and feel my deadlift all in my lower back.
powerlifting,3blzhm,liftingluieee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"Have you tried out sumo deadlifts? Just curious.  To fix your leg drive issue, I think doing some reps of deficit will really help you out. Or at least practice deadlift up to knees. Starting at a deficit will force you to drive/press with your legs. And doing deadlift up to knees specifically focuses on the pushing motion of the lift. When you deadlift up to knees you don't pull with your back, you just keep your back the same neutral angle while pushing the ground away from you. You may need to work on your hamstrings as well. I have the same issue, I always end up using my lower back. Check if your lower back rounds at heavy weights. For me, at least, my hamstrings and lower back fight for control of my pelvis. When you set up, you want your pelvis to be tilted forward with the torso. If your hamstrings are too tight, your setup and initial movement can be pretty tough."
powerlifting,3blzhm,BGabrielx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:53:17 2015 UTC,"What rep scheme are you doing if deadlifts fuck up your CNS? Don't be afraid of going lighter and doing some volume, try 5x5 at 75%. Also, if you always use a belt then try going beltless on everything for a month or two. It's possible you're not bracing properly on deadlift (happened to me) and beltless pulls will make that very apparent."

A little history, I just started training the 3 big lifts by doing StrongLifts in January of this year. Prior to that, I always hit the gym, doing BB sort of stuff. Before starting StrongLifts, my S/B/D was at around 285/250/380. I stopped doing StrongLifts at around the end of March. I got my lifts up to 315/280/415. Since then I have competed in a mock meet at my university in late May, I hit 335/300/450. I did well at the mock meet at 166lbs, and I that made me want to take powerlifting more seriously. I wasn't sure how to program, and I just looked online. I ended up choosing to do the Sheiko 29-31 blocks. Currently, I am approaching the end of the 29 block. It has been exhausting and fun. But I am not sure if this is the right approach for programming. I know squat is my weakest lift, and I can't tell if I am actually progressing fast enough. I am starting to think that the Sheiko blocks should be used when my progression slows down/steadies more. I was thinking that maybe I'll just finish up the block, and find another program that can maximize my noob gains. I can really use some advice with my programming."

I sometimes bench after my OHP days and squat after my deadlift days, but my workouts are already 1.5 - 2 hours long, so I don't always have time to get the added volume in.

If you want my honest opinion, I don't think he can do it at 220 maybe at 242. 220 is the weight class I think he's competing it in August (bossofbosses 2).  Coan's 901 at 220 is just....ridiculous to say the least.  However, I do think Green can pull 881 though which is still 4 times bodyweight."
powerlifting,3bglj4,yaodashuai,3,Mon Jun 29 04:59:32 2015 UTC,Even if he's competing 220 he will be 240 on the platform so it doesn't really matter. Not sure if coan had 2 hour weight in tho.
powerlifting,3bglj4,PerfectNemesis,9,Mon Jun 29 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"I believe Coan does say in the recent Mark Bell videos that the 901 pull at 220 was done under IPF rules, so 2 hour weigh-in and a stiff bar."
powerlifting,3bglj4,enDelt09,7,Mon Jun 29 19:48:39 2015 UTC,People just don't give lifters in the past enough credit. What's the point of comparing an old 220 record when you are 240+ on the platform using Spaghetti bars.
powerlifting,3bglj4,PerfectNemesis,3,Tue Jun 30 01:49:06 2015 UTC,I think it highlights more how lifters these days are placing importance on things that don't matter and largely ignoring the things that do.
powerlifting,3bglj4,gzcl,3,Tue Jun 30 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"24 hour weigh in would probably be a substantial difference, yeah? The bar type probably too decently"

powerlifting,3bgoo6,thyacinth,3,Mon Jun 29 01:48:22 2015 UTC,"1) Since you are 11 weeks out just continue with your current program and take a deload week when necessary.  2) I started peaking for my meet 3 weeks out. I cannot stress how necessary it is to read your federations rules on each movement and to practice them; it really messed me up during my 2nd bench attempt   3) If you're gonna be using the belt in the competition then start using the belt during your peaking cycle. I trained with my belt while I was testing 3RMs and 1RMs only however during my peaking week.   4) It's your first meet, stay in the 52 range so you can also have a few pounds extra in case you happen to gain weight during the 11 weeks.   5) If you're still 19 by the time of the meet then sign up for Teen III.   6) You'll be okay.  7) I calculated your current maxes and totaled them (409lbs/185,5kg) and at your weight you would have a 242 Wilks; which is pretty decent for your first meet.   8) You've got plenty of time to make the transition, I'm currently transitioning to low bar as well.   I've only competed once but I hope this helps. Good luck with your meet and keep /r/powerlifting  updated!"

powerlifting,3bgoo6,demetrius_savelio,2,Tue Jun 30 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"Haven't actually done a meet yet, no meets in my area until November (which will be my novice meet). However I have read the stock answers to most of these questions online.  Weight cuts: Don't bother unless you know you can break a record.  The flight: Its a novice meet and three weeks out. Guys going to IPF worlds were taking 20 hours flights 5 days out. You should be fine, maybe just a bit stiff in your next training session.  Belt: My belt (10mm Inzer) hurt the first month or so, took a wee while to break in. Plus as a noob it changed my form just a lil as I wasn't very experienced and had trouble bracing properly. Have a practice with it, if you think it could work do it , if not don't worry. One way I found to speed up the break in was to roll the belt up like you would a yoga mat, unroll, flip and repeat.  Peaking and switching stances: I would just keep doing your normal program, then the last 2-3 weeks start taking some sets of three, then multiple sets of 1 with commands. Use this to chose your opening attempt (extra light, use it to settle your nerves.  If you start practicing low bar and sumo after your normal sets, get a feel for it and you might think you can switch. If not, don't worry about it and you could just make it your little project until your next meet.  Again, haven't done my first meet yet so I will happily defer to anyone else. Just saw you didn't have any answers yet so thought I would give you something to start with."

For open, my t-rex arms might come in handy for bench since the current record is 55kg for u47 and I'm still sorta linear progressing so.  Yeah, I'll probably try low bar and sumo as fun post-workset stuff. Thanks so much for the suggestions and for taking pity on my empty comment thread :3"

Might make the switch too. I've seen there are some empty records in my area but I don't really see the point holding a random non competitive record.   Also about switching, seeing as you are still <6 months I don't think it would be too bad. I went from untrained to 145 kg low bar in my first 12 weeks so it could be done."

powerlifting,3bgoo6,Magic_warlock0-,2,Mon Jun 29 09:57:20 2015 UTC,"3) The belt may not need to be broken in that much. Try it out with your warmups first to get a feel for it, then progress from there. I'm normally against adding in a piece of equipment that you've not used often in training, especially for a first meet. However, a belt is vital (in my case) for staying even tighter doing heavy attempts, so play it carefully and make sure your form isn't altered too much.  4) I would highly advise against cutting weight for a first meet, in general, unless you're absolutely sure your form is solid and you can break a record.  5) Sign up as a Junior for the meet, as that's what you'll be at the time of the meet. You can always provide clarity to the meet provider or the people running the flight/lifter table.  6) You'll be just fine.  7) You would do decently well in your weight class, maybe 2nd or 3rd if you can bump your squat up some more. (basing this off some local past meets)  8) Being 11 weeks out, you've plenty of time to change around whatever you need. Find out what leverages work for you, and make sure you can get someone to critique your form for both the squats and deadlifts."

I really want to see where I can go with a belt, but I'm also scared that I'll F shit up.   4)i think if I do hit that 100kg deadlift confidently, I'll try to cut weight. The current teen III u47 American record is a 100kg deadlift and I only have a few months left of teenagerness which brings me to   5) I'm a teen III and will be at the meet (September) .

powerlifting,3beni9,free_ryan,3,Sun Jun 28 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"IANA anatomist, but some preliminary wiki'ing suggests that might just be the lumbar portion of the erector spinae. It kind of hangs out under the thiracilumbar fascia which is what I thought it was until I found out that a fascia isn't a muscle."

powerlifting,3beni9,scarfsnarf,2,Mon Jun 29 08:04:25 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with a sudden reversion to disordered eating the past month. It hit a week before my meet & while I forced myself to eat enough food the day before and day of the meet to do pretty well, the following weeks have robbed me of all my gainz.    This week I had an epiphany about myself and it really helped me turn around the whole not eating more than 5-900 calories a day thing that made me almost pass out in the gym the other day.   I've managed to eat normally for about 4 days in a row now, so yesterday I celebrated by flipping some tires and then having my friend over to eat cheesy chicken nuggets, and waffled doughnut ice cream sandwiches.    I'm back to lifting next week, and I promise to use yesterday's pig-out gains for good, not evil.  Ok, maybe slightly evil."

powerlifting,3beni9,Harbinger_of_Kittens,2,Sun Jun 28 23:35:38 2015 UTC,I just got my knee sleeves and wrist straps in the mail from Powerbelly. Now all I'm waiting on is my belt. I haven't been this excited to use something I bought in a long time. I'm like a kid the night before Christmas. I can't wait to workout tomorrow.

powerlifting,3beni9,OakleyFitness,2,Mon Jun 29 18:06:16 2015 UTC,Lets get some real shit - talk Sunday going....I'm actually an oly lifter and I creep over here because alot of jackasses in that subreddit forget how important absolute strength is in snatch and cleans so I like getting strength intel from you guys.  I do see some dingle dick similarities between the two groups but that's life.  The one thing that fucks  with me the most is this bullshit about Mark Rippetoe-why? If you haven't read his starting strength or practical programming book then shut the fuck up about him because you don't know him or his theories or his practice. The guys who have read his material and still hate provide a reason- because he provides his proof for methods-mechanical/anatomical proof and he's actually competed and won powerlifting meets.  He has sat down with Karwoski and Coen and on and on
powerlifting,3beni9,Megachiles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:26:07 2015 UTC,Here is a great example of him taking you to school and how much knowledge and experience he brings to the table: an article on how you're probably using the wrong belt to deadlift- warning you'll get your face melted off: https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-belt-and-the-deadlift

But I've been so busy working 2 jobs and training for my upcoming meet that I haven't even opened a single book yet.   My meet is 2 weeks away and then I'm going to Europe for 3 weeks, and then school starts again shorts after. By the time I finish all 5 books the next season will probably be starting. So much for summer breaks..."
powerlifting,3beni9,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 28 18:18:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. My girlfriend has been ranting like fuck about how far the show has departed from the books.
powerlifting,3beni9,GuziCowSki,2,Sun Jun 28 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"It has, but supposedly GRRM is working with the producers, so what is happening in the series may be things that are slated to happen in the books, just on a faster time-line."

powerlifting,3bcrqu,DrColossus1,6,Sun Jun 28 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, wasn't all horrible.   It was a pretty fast meet. I was flight two and took my first squat at 10, bench at 11:45, then my first DL at 1:40. Perfect pace IMO."
powerlifting,3bcrqu,I_love_bearss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:42:48 2015 UTC,That is a fast meet!  I did an RPS meet and the pace was horrible.  I took my first squat at 10 and didn't do my final pull until 7:30pm
powerlifting,3bcrqu,ceejayess,2,Sun Jun 28 15:28:31 2015 UTC,Do you have a custom training cycle or are you just running one of the plans posted on the website?

powerlifting,3bcrqu,Pritulas,0,Sun Jun 28 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"It's been pretty great! I was in contact with Bryce during the entire meet, and he responded to emails quickly during the training cycle.   He also kept into mind that I don't want to turn into a piggy, so we did a minicut at the start of the cycle and bulked into the meet.   Going to do the next 7 week cycle with him as well, and probably going to stick with him after that."

powerlifting,3bdpss,olefty,11,Sun Jun 28 06:26:40 2015 UTC,"Quick disclaimer: this is based off my experiences and I'm not a physio. I recommend you see a good one to get case-specific help.  I have had lots of issues with my hips and tried a few things. The #1 thing that helped me was actually from a physio, and he basically said I have abysmal hip mobility (18 years sitting on your ass playing computer games does that to you...)  This causes your hip to impinge when you get to about parallel as it doesn't have the required mobility to move to the back of the socket. Hence you get pain/inflammation and a shitty squat. Also, if you watch a side view of your squat I bet you don't get more than about parallel before you get butt wink. This is likely because (again due to hip mobility) you run out of room for you hip to move, so you try to achieve depth by rounding your lower back. Which isn't good.  What's fixed it? (well, improving it... It's an ongoing thing). Band distraction exercises (Kelly starret has several great videos here). Practicing my squat beside a mirror, making sure to keep my lower back neutral (I stop at the point it starts to round). I try to get deeper as time goes by, hopefully signifying an improvement in mobility. Also I just had a massage from a sports guy and that seems to have helped a lot (think I had a bunch of scarring at my hip from 8+ months of this going on and partially healing).   I tried all the other stuff... Hamstring stretches, glute stretches, glute strengthening, hip flexor stretches. Nothing has worked as well as my hip mobility work has. Certainly they have helped, so do them too, but if you're like me they won't fix it.   Good luck and hope this helps."
powerlifting,3bdpss,greenalleycat,2,Sun Jun 28 09:49:36 2015 UTC,"I used to work as a PTA so I had a glimpse into a little bit on the hips. My friend has noticed that I have a little butt wink; however, everything stays tight which is weird, but good?   I'll continue doing research and playing around with other things. Thank you for your insight, I really appreciate it."
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"staying tight is important,  but the problem with the but wink is the sheering force on your spine as it transitions from neutral to a flexed position. I highly recommend looking up some of kelly starretts videos. It takes allot of time, but the mobility will come and the butt wink will go!"
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,2,Mon Jun 29 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"same boat, the mobility wod videos helped a ton, but one thing that people over look is just spending more time in a squat per day. I generally get 4-8 times per day where i sit completely relaxed in the hole of an air squat for 3-5 minutes. I think this helped with my hip mobility and pain more than anything else. I go it from a physical therapy appointment with Roop Sihota(kelly starretts partner)"
powerlifting,3bdpss,greenalleycat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"Good idea. I would add that you should only hang out at the point where you can keep a neutral spine. Try and sink it lower over time, but no point hanging out with your lower back tucked under you like a tail"
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,2,Mon Jun 29 08:03:49 2015 UTC,"prior to talking to my PT i would have agreed with you, but the point is to get your hips used to staying in a fully flexed position at the bottom range. We are meant to poop and sit in general in a position where we are totally relaxed which for 90% of people would have a flexed spine. Under no load, this likely has no negative impacts on the spine/lumbar health and a positive one on the hips. Hopefully, allowing for the hips avoid running into the femur(causing butt wink) until a much lower point. After doing this for 5 months, I nearly have a fully neutral spine as low as my ass can get before my calves stop me from getting lower haha, while i used to get butt wink before parallel.  I hope that all made sense, if not i would be happy to discuss it more and here your thoughts"
powerlifting,3bdpss,greenalleycat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:36:38 2015 UTC,I think I get what you're saying. I have no qualifications to refute it so I'll trust your PT :P I was just repeating what someone on here had told me
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,2,Mon Jun 29 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"haha ya, honestly when he said it to me, first thing i said was ""with my back rounded?"" and he in more or less words said ""Obviously you have the ability to squat with a neutral spine while under load, but for 40 minutes per day just sit in the hole, you should be able to totally relax and eat dinner while squatting."""
powerlifting,3bdpss,greenalleycat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"Well neat, never knew that it was OK. Thanks!"
powerlifting,3bdpss,askyourselfthat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you with over a decade of sitting in an office chair 9 hours a day, 5 days a week. For me it feels like my femurs are going to rip out of their sockets when i squat.   I'm doing the same things as you and at the very least it hasn't got worse. One thing i have changed though is my foot stance. I played around with it by determining the foot stance that gave me the most depth before the pain started."
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:43:47 2015 UTC,"i replied to the other guys comment, hopefully it can help you too:   the thing that helped my hips the most was when my sports  PT told me to just spend more time per day in a full squat, totally relaxed, back rounded and just trying to relax into the bottom for 3-5 minutes a few times per day."
powerlifting,3bdpss,askyourselfthat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:36:23 2015 UTC,Any particular reason why the PT said to squat with a rounded back?
powerlifting,3bdpss,TheSwolerBear,2,Tue Jun 30 05:53:06 2015 UTC,"not to squat with a rounded back, but to air squat down and sit, which for most people will have a rounded back. Like this and this .  Sorry if i didn't make that clear, he did NOT say to squat under load with a rounded back(should always be a neutral spine). He said to sit in a squat for 40 minutes per day and it is ok for the back to be rounded during this time to stretch the hips.  my other comments on this thread explain it better haha"
powerlifting,3bdpss,askyourselfthat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, ill give it a try."
powerlifting,3bdpss,MixedMartialAwesome,2,Tue Jun 30 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"I've had the same problem. Here are a few things that have helped me out 1. Change up your stance. Play around with your foot positioning and the bar position. Find the stance that causes the least amount of pain.  2. Stretch you hips. Several times each day, I squat down deep and just sit (in the hole). Try to stay as upright as possible when you do this. 3. Practice squatting with a resistance band right above your knees. I don't know which has helped me the most because I have been doing them simultaneously. But I rarely have hip pain from squatting now."

powerlifting,3bc377,nattybber,9,Sat Jun 27 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"Use the orignial version, Nick Wright probably made a mistake copying it.  Basically what his program says is that after completing this 5 week cycle if you can hit 1 rep at 97% that means that you're good for 1 rep at 103%. That doesn't make sense to me.  Candito's program says if you can hit 2 reps at 97.5% you are good for 1 rep at 103%. That does make sense logically."
powerlifting,3bc377,connorskific,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"So go off of Candito's original multipliers based on the reps.  Now the question is, do I use the 97% or 97.5% to test my 1-4 reps? I know it's only 5 pounds or so, but could make a difference. Keep in mind I have been using Nick Wright's percentages throughout the program (although they are not far off of the original)."

powerlifting,3bc377,badgerX3mushroom,0,Sat Jun 27 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"So go with 97% and use the original multiplier (2 reps by 1.03, 3 reps by 1.06, 4 reps by 1.09)? Got it.  I hope I am not screwing up my predictions by doing 97% instead of 97.5%."

powerlifting,3b889c,Chicksan,17,Fri Jun 26 20:06:02 2015 UTC,"The rule is in place so that there is:  A-  an easy excuse for when the spotters grab the bar and the lifter tries to argue.  ""Well the bar started going down so it was gonna be reds anyways.""    And B- The spotters are less worried about getting yelled at, so they do their job better and faster  Its for the protection of the lifters and the spotter/loaders so that the sport is safer.  I've never spotted a 900+ squat but I've spotted too many 7 and 800+ squats to remember and they are terrifying.  The difference between ""maybe he's just double dipping"" and ""oh shit he's failing"" is a small one and you need to be able to react quickly  Duh."

One day you have people complaining that arching on the bench is cheating....now you have people saying up and down motion is an arbritary rule, haha.  Just can't win on here.  No downward motion on the ascent of the lift has been the rule as long as powerlifting has been around."

powerlifting,3b889c,point3edu,9,Sun Jun 28 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"I still don't get the ""no downward movement""-rules on the squat, bench or the deadlift.   The first time I asked I was told it was there because spotters used to pretty much exclusively have to catch you if you were going to fail so ""no downward movement"" removed ambiguity on their part as to when it was okay for them to come in to help rather than have to dive in after total failure. But it still made no sense for deadlift and with monolifts and other safety measures it still seems odd.  Is there a particular reason the rule is still around? Surely if you get the weight down and then bring it back up again you did squat the weight."
powerlifting,3b889c,minorsecond,5,Sat Jun 27 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"Someone a few days ago said it was because you can [somehow] generate more momentum. I don't see how that would happen here, unless he were to go all the way down into the hole and bounce off his calves, but I'm sure they just want to be consistent with the rules. To me, it seems like it would just make the lift more difficult, but I'm also a novice and don't have the technique nailed down."
powerlifting,3b889c,point3edu,5,Sat Jun 27 12:27:42 2015 UTC,That sounds like someone trying to draw reasoning from the Clean and Jerk; where you have to allow the bar to stop bouncing after the clean before you can jerk it so as to not use any momentum from the bar bend. But that wouldn't make sense during a squat as you're also receiving the bend on the downward motion whilst you're under load.
powerlifting,3b889c,OmnipotentStudent,3,Sat Jun 27 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"Meh, it used to be the bar couldn't stop moving, lol. Tfw got called on this rule today :'("
powerlifting,3b889c,Unfairtex,4,Sun Jun 28 00:16:35 2015 UTC,"Reasonably certain that the rule has to do with the stretch shortening cycle and its ability to be exploited for increased force generation at a sticking point of the lift.   In any event, it's the IPF. No monolifts, or anything of the sort in IPF events. Furthermore... It's a rule. Just is what it is. Why is there no heaving allowed on the bench? Why does bench have to be paused? Why can't you hitch a deadlift?   Sure, the weight still went from A to B, but not within the confines of the rules. That's what makes it a sport."
powerlifting,3b889c,point3edu,2,Sat Jun 27 14:32:39 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I suppose what I'm asking is why is it arbitrarily the rule?  For example, with the bench heave; I think people want to see it lifted with minimal input from the lower body and as much with the arms as possible. Hitching in the deadlift; they want the weight to stay in the hands and not be rested on the body. So yes, whilst it might be arbitrary, that might be one of the arbitrary reasons for ruling it that way.  I was not aware of the  ""stretch shortening cycle"" so perhaps that's arbitrarily why the rule came about."
powerlifting,3b889c,Unfairtex,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"Like I said... I don't think it's arbitrary. Stretch shortening cycle would be my best guess. I've never seen a formal declaration of rule methodology with respect to the IPF.   I DO understand your point, but it's kinda' like rules in any sport. At some point you just sort of bite the bullet and accept that there probably is a reason, regardless of whether or not you know what it is.  Another option could be control. Most of the other rules are in place so as to demonstrate control of the weight. Downward motion on the squat demonstrates either a weakness, or a lack of control. Pretty clear that Ray has the strength, but wasn't able to control the weight sufficiently. Could also be that.  Either way, doesn't really matter all that much."
powerlifting,3b889c,SleepEatLift,2,Sat Jun 27 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's a rule. Just is what it is.   The other rules are in place to prevent making the movement easier, like hitching a deadlift or bouncing a press. This certainly doesn't make the squat any easier."
powerlifting,3b889c,Unfairtex,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"Ehhh.   Feel free to read my other reply. Could be the stretch shortening cycle at play, could also be a level of control of the weight that they want.  It is a rule, one way or the other."
powerlifting,3b889c,SleepEatLift,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:00:13 2015 UTC,"I understand the stretch reflex, but it can't possibly make the lift easier than not stopping and re-descending. It is a rule, but like you and others mentioned more-so for safety or to demonstrate control."

powerlifting,3b889c,mrnate0620,14,Sat Jun 27 01:15:04 2015 UTC,Bar moved downward partway through the movement. Basically the bar can stop but not move back down then go back up

Also the clamp does not stay on the power rack tightly - it slides right off no matter how tight you clamp it down.    At this point the screw is completely galled or stripped and it's lying in a metal recycling bin in my gym.  I would highly recommend looking for a different roller."

powerlifting,3b6dqw,krakensfury,2,Fri Jun 26 16:13:58 2015 UTC,If go with Powerbelly wraps use Disbrow15 and you'll get 15% off. The felonies are a good wrap if you're wrapping yourself. Stretchy enough you can get them tight but firm enough to give you good rebound.

powerlifting,3b6dqw,Mdisbrow,2,Sat Jun 27 02:38:48 2015 UTC,"Ive used them once. They're exactly like the felonies but with rubber weaved through the outside. It was the most painful wrap I've ever used, so bad I didn't even try to squat. My favorites are the death rows but those are too heavy to wrap on your own. Felonies are most similar to the red Lillibridgd wrap or the efs heavies, but the material seems to hold up better than the slingshot wraps."

I don't have a ton of experience with them, but I found the titanium's much easier to wrap myself and also much gentler on my knees. I could probably get a few more lbs out of the THP's but more difficult to wrap and a lot more painful for a first wrap."

powerlifting,3b4wfi,SofaKingNatty,2,Fri Jun 26 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"I found it to be a really interesting video. In the kindest way possible, I don't think he is a lifter who worries too much about a bio-mechanical or scientific approach to his training. Rather he focuses on certain cues etc. His comments in the video about doing BTN lat pull downs to work on back tightness in the squat are, to me, a perfect example of this.  As a fairly superstitious lifter myself, I find great value in this approach; notwithstanding that I would like to see it combined with some more scientific insight (how much carryover does upper back work really have to the squat?). Making my lifts insanely consistent has always been the best thing I can do to benefit my training, and I feel that Brandon's approach may be beneficial in this respect. Would be interested to see how others view his comments here.  Good to see the big fella back on youtube"
powerlifting,3b4wfi,powerliftinglife,4,Fri Jun 26 06:56:28 2015 UTC,Why do you need science to prove it? Do you think there is no carryover at all? If not then who cares how much when any little thing helps? Not to mention upper back is useful for both deadlift and bench anyways.
powerlifting,3b4wfi,kraken514,2,Fri Jun 26 12:18:16 2015 UTC,"Given this reply, I think you may have misread my comment. I was by no means saying that a lack of scientific practice was necessarily a bad thing? Although obviously there IS a place for reasoning in a discussion such as this, that is obvious to anyone. Science is nothing more than the study of a given area based on experimentation and observation.  In addition to this, the reason I asked the question was because there is a reason to make training efficient. If I'm better off I don't know say bench pressing in order to get better at bench pressing, maybe that is a favorable route? Look at the training of Mike Tuscherer, arguably one of the best drug free powerlifters. He uses virtually no upper back accessory work for himself or any of the various elite level lifters who train under his supervision. A very relevant statement by him: ""Rowing is frequent in American inspired programs. And American powerlifting gets its culture from bodybuilding. Rowing is much less frequent in Russian or other programs when they get their culture from weightlifting. More to the point, I haven't seen the benefit of rows and similar movements to improving the powerlifts directly. And honestly I'm not totally sold on the idea of rows preventing injury. That said, it won't hurt to do it.""  I do believe there is minimal carryover from upper back work to the bench and the squat, and the deadlift to a greater degree. And I was actually supporting what Brandon was saying, as was clear from my initial comment."

powerlifting,3b2k7p,NikhilT90,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Week on a cruise then 5 weeks to meet, thinking of high frequency RPE training, peaking tips?      Last week I read the RTS manual, and many of the articles on the RTS site, and have been trying out a little bootleg RPE/autoreg training since then, and I'm really starting to like it.  So I'm trying to move into actually setting up some programming for leading up to my meet in September. Beginning of August I'm going on a cruise, so it's extremely highly likely that I will be ""taking a deload"" that week AKA drinking my face off and not lifting whatsoever. When I get back, it's 5 weeks to the meet so 4 weeks of training and then the deload/taper week.  I really would like to mesh the RPE style training with my usual high frequency training, so here's my plan for personalizing the method:  Using Mike T's ""slot"" approach: 3 Slots for Squat - Main, Primary assistance, Secondary assist. 3 Slots for DL - Main, Prim. assist, 2nd assist. 6 Slots for BP - Main, Prim. assist 1, Prim. assist 2, 2nd assist, shoulders, tris (may change shoulders and tris to more competition bench or other exercises)    Day 1: Main Squat Day D2: Main BP Day D3: Main DL Day D4: BP Assist Day D5: Sq/DL Assist Day D6: Secondary BP Day    Main Squat Main BP Main DL Prim BP Assist 2 2nd Sq Assist Shoulders   Prim. Sq Assist Prim BP Assist 1 2nd DL Assist 2nd BP Assist Prim DL Assist Tris    Week 1: x4 @ RPE 8-9, 10-15% fatigue (ramping up getting body used to volume again) Week 2: x3 @ RPE 8-9, 25-35% fatigue (volume) Week 3: x3 @ RPE 9-10, 10-20% fatigue (begin taper) Week 4: x2 @ RPE 9-10, 0-10% fatigue (peaking week)    Still working out a lot of the kinks, anyone with RTS/RPE training experience have any thoughts, ideas, or amendments I should make to this basic template?"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,talking-box,2,Thu Jun 25 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"When people list fatigue, they usually are listing the fatigue accrued from the drop sets PER lift, not total weekly fatigue.  So an RTS protocol might look like  Competition Raw Bench, x4@9, 4-6% fatigue, load drop  Which means if you might do something like  90x4@7  95x4@8  100x4@9  95x4@8.5  95x4@9  Because you were able to hit the same fatigue after taking 5% off the bar, we can say you accrued 5% fatigue from that lift.  Now in terms of peaking, I think Garrett Blevin's video on peaking is really good. Work up to x1@8, x3@9, 5% on the comp lifts for three weeks, bring the supplementary volume down over time, then hit openers the week of the meet."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Teekam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"When people list fatigue, they usually are listing the fatigue accrued from the drop sets PER lift, not total weekly fatigue.   Yeah so shoulda clarified a bit on that fatigue bit. First off I wrote it as the total fatigue of upper and lower seperated (i.e. week 1 is 15% fatigue on upper, 15% on lower)  The initial plan/thought process: week 1: ~5% fatigue on 3 of the 6 slots for upper/lower, definitely main competition movements and others at my discretion, totalling about 15% week 2: fatigue all the things and get dat volume week 3: similar to week 1 but at a higher intensity, so about 1/2 the volume of the prior week but extra work on the comp lifts week 4: hopefully finish peaking, only doing fatigue sets for select movements at most   Garrett Blevin's video   will watch when I get off of work"

Does this seem reasonable? I have some concerns about the bench - I might switch to some kind of accumulation pattern of starting at 5x5 and adding reps instead of weight. Then instead it'd be 5x5 Tuesday, 5x6 Friday, increasing up to 10 reps and then increasing the weight more."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,TheAesir,2,Thu Jun 25 13:54:23 2015 UTC,"That's not too different from what I do, major differences being that I do triples on the heavy day, only deadlift heavy at the end of the week, and have an extra bench day. That workload is more than doable. I found my bench stopped responding to 5x5 work so I added the extra day, but milk it as long as you can. The leg extensions probably won't do much for you."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,69swaggyboi420,2,Thu Jun 25 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"IMO your Thursday and Friday on this would be almost worthless, assuming you mean 1 set of 5 reps. Instead, you could work up to that top set of 5, then take 90% of that and work with it for a few sets for however many reps, somewhere between 4 and 8 probably. You basically just need more volume than 5 reps on a day.  Your alternative method sounds interesting, but that's a whole lot of accumulation in what comes out to like 3 weeks. If you're still a novice, it could work for a short amount of time though."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Metallicadpa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:21:40 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense: I think I'll do 3x8 back off sets for squats at ~80-85% of that weight depending on how I feel. For the bench, I might try it out and see how I go, you're right it probably won't work so great, but volume is a good thing. I can adjust if it goes badly/tires me out/I keep hitting failure, perhaps increasing reps on only some of the sets (or aiming for something like 8 8 7 7 6 before increasing)."

I've gotten my setup done right where I don't round my back, but I guess I lost it. I'm extremely frustrated... I have been playing around with my form quite a bit and I'm just really struggling. I think my main issue is opening up my hips. And I think part of that is due to my shoulder placement. I think my arms are directly above the bar, instead of a little forward the bar. Will moving my arm placement like that improve my hips on my setup? It seems like my pelvis isn't tilting forward with my torso when I set up. Edit: I tried to figure out my form. I think my hamstrings and my lower back are fighting for my pelvis. My hamstrings are winning so my lower back is rounding."

It felt great for a bit, and then I felt much more back rounding, hip rising, and difficult lockouts.  Intend to go back to my older grip position, where the middle finger wraps around the section where the knurling and the smooth part meet.   It may also just be leverages. My bar ROM is pretty significant, given short arms and a shorter torso. If that's the case for you as well, you may have to widen your stance."

powerlifting,3b2k7p,radixmalorumest,4,Thu Jun 25 15:27:48 2015 UTC,Really simple fix is to lift your big toe in your shoe. Your body is pretty good about not dumping forward so you'll naturally sit back more. I would also focus on keeping your chest up and pushing back into the bar.  If those don't work then something is weak and I think that pattern means quads.
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Hibagon,2,Thu Jun 25 15:57:19 2015 UTC,Chances are your primary movers (probably quads) have fatigued to the point where they're struggling to push the weight up or your core is failing and just dumping you forward.  I vote focus on pushing your traps back and trying to stay as upright as possible.  The stricter you are on your rep work the more work your quads will get.

Any time I try any form of leg drive I either push myself toward the end of the bench or I start lifting my ass off the bench. Any pointers on getting leg drive (is it even important) while not breaking down form?
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Catechin,3,Thu Jun 25 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"You need to rotate your hips more.  Try this: sit on the bench.  The part of your butt on the bench, is the part that needs to be on the bench when you press.  To me this is the bottom of the butt.  Most people bench on the back of their butt.  When you're driving your legs and you're on the back of your butt, it goes up.  If you rotate your hips, so you are sitting on your butt (bottom), when you push with your legs, it will push your hips towards your shoulders, not up.   Leg drive was a huge help for me in getting past some sticking points.  After a good bench day, my legs, core, chest and arms are sore."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Hibagon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I AM sitting on the 'back' of my butt, though, when I push my legs (effectively moving my incorrectly aligned hips towards my shoulders) I move my whole body on the bench. I am benching again tomorrow, so I'll see if I can manage sitting on the bottom of my butt. Thanks!"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Catechin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"No problem, let me know if you're still having issues, I can post a video"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Hibagon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"I am working on this too. It helps me to think of stability in bench as coming from an intense all body isometric contraction. I drive with the legs and equally resist that drive from shoulders and butt bench contact points, and the result is a very tight base from which to bench. Some degree of arch feels important for this."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,puffah0lic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, just can't seem to really implement it without moving myself on the bench. I 'feel' like I have a good form; butt and shoulders/head are the only thing on the bench, I pull my scapulae down and back, feet are planted. I've tried forcing my heals down hard to develop leg drive, but I can't seem to do that and maintain my butt contact with the bench. Pushing my legs in any direction tends to move me on the bench in the opposite direction. I don't know if it matters, I'm pretty tall (6'5"") and fairly wide (the edge of the benches are about mid shoulder)."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Hibagon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"The captain of my PL team uses a rubber mat to help stay on the bench. A few other members also use a mat or giant rubber bands to give themselves more friction to stay on.  I think you're supposed to push your body towards the back of the bench, though. Right?"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,puffah0lic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:42:49 2015 UTC,"Get your feet a bit wider.  I can get way more driver with a wider stance and it also makes it impossible for me to raise my butt.  Too wide causes cramps, though, so experiment. :P"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,Blunderhooks2012,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll give that a shot as well and see how I do. I FEEL like my legs are pretty wide, but I can push them out more and play around with it."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,foxtrot331,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:16:32 2015 UTC,Welcome.  The other thing I've heard some people do is shove their feet even further back closer to their head.  But if you're a heels down bencher that's probably going to be difficult.  Some combination of out and back may do it.
powerlifting,3b2k7p,DoktorLuciferWong,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"I am a heel down guy, but I'm willing to give it a shot and see if it helps some."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,megatron81,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Some already stated this, but moving foot position can eliminate any form of ass coming off the bench, simply because you can get into positions where it's not physically possible. This could be either widening your foot position to a degree where you can't raise your butt, or ""tucking"" in the feet to a degree where you can't raise your butt. Both of these have pro's and cons, and somewhere in between you should be able to find a sweet spot that works for you.  In regards to sliding up the bench when you push with your legs, it's most likely down to the actual bench itself. You're not lifting in a powerlifting gym I assume, and the surface on the bench is probably some form of smooth leather like fabric. Competition benches will have much better grip on your upper body so that you won't slide when going ham on the legs. You can throw bands around the length of the bench so that when you retract your shoulders they are actually sitting on top of the bands, and your sliding days should be dealt with."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:38:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct on the bench..it's plastic/leather/faux leather and pretty slick. Reading your response made me think of another lifter there that lays down what looks like a rubberized towel (hard to describe, sort of looks like the liners you'd put in your tool box to keep tools from sliding around) on the upper part of the bench. I'll have to see about that as well. And I'm going to give the foot position a shot. I've always gone flat footed (shits essentially vertical) but will start playing around with the positioning to see if I can drive without form going to crap.  Thanks for the response!"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,megatron81,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:25:27 2015 UTC,"No problem. I lift in a commercial gym myself and the benches here are absolutely garbage as well. Not only will a proper bench be a bit wider, but they will also be ""grippier"" on the back. That towel thing is probably exactly for this reason I'd imagine. I got the rubberband thing from old ass Brandon Campbell, as he's had the same problems with the benches in his gym.  Yea I can't do anything but flat footed in the bench as well, if I get up on my toes and start exerting force up through my legs I tend to cramp up rather easily. I personally haven't found my sweet spot yet, but slowly trying to adjust foot positioning to hopefully get it locked at some point."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"I put exactly that type of liner on the bench in my gym for exactly this reason.  I just went on Amazon and searched for ""non slip shelf liner"" or something similar.  Also helps if you wear a cotton shirt rather than synthetic."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,megatron81,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:11:12 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, just looking for some opinions on what you all think is the easiest way to get from a 475lb squat to 540+ squat. I have until next March or April when I plan to compete for the first time.   Background info: went from a 365lb to 475 squat this September-February by running Smolov once and then back to regular programming. At the end of Feb I started cutting from ~240 lbs to 200 lbs so far. Planning on cutting to 195 or so, finishing the cut early August. I'm torn whether I should compete in 93kg (204.6lbs) or 105kg (231lbs). I'm 5'11"". I was thinking maybe compete in 93kg class for my first competition and then moving to the 105kg class after that. However limiting the amount of weight I gain this year could limit my squat too much.  Programming: planning on starting Smolov in early September. My first Smolov cycle got me from 365 to 455 lbs. So my guess is that this Smolov cycle might get me from 475 to 530 or 540. Then back to regular programming for a while and run Smolov another time to peak for whenever the meet is.   Sorry for so much writing. If I missed anything then ask.  TL;DR: The junior record for squats in my province in 93kg is 530lb. In the 105kg class it is 550lbs. I would like to take one of these records. Planning on running Smolov once to get my squat up then again to add more and peak. What do you all think?"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,KHthe8th,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"Deadlift question. I'm fairly tiny for a guy, 5'5"", 132lbs. I pull conventional. I'm worried I might be using too narrow a stance and pulling too close. I know the bar needs to be close, but is there a such thing as TOO close?  How much stress should there be on the low back when pulling conventional? I've had a few people look at my pulls, and they tell me it looks fine no visible rounding etc, so there's that..  I'd ask the more experienced members of my uni's PL/WL team, but the practices are pretty empty atm. Just me and a few weightlifters."

powerlifting,3b2k7p,KHthe8th,3,Thu Jun 25 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"How do you adjust for the differences between performance in the gym and performance on the platform?  For deadlifts I always underperform in the gym and end up opening way too light, which results in having to make huge jumps or just leaving too many kg's on the platform."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,7,Thu Jun 25 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the way I've done it is just remembering that in a meet I perform better. My deadlifts are god awful in the gym but smooth in a meet. Opening way too light on deadlifts is okay since it can generally have bigger jumps without much kick back (ex. 7.5-10kg). That way I max our a bit more but don't shoot myself totally in the foot on the way."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:18:40 2015 UTC,Opening too light is never a problem in the grand scheme of things. But I seem to end up making 15+kg jumps and my 3rd attempt ends up being what my 2nd should've been.
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,2,Thu Jun 25 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"Woah, you mean your gym max is like 75% of your competition max? Because that's quite a big difference."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,OmnipotentStudent,4,Thu Jun 25 15:33:32 2015 UTC,Actually it was 90% before my last meet gym max was 260 (I opened at 255) and I pulled 290 in comp and was told by coaches (who have 20+ years experience) that I could've pulled 300.
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,2,Thu Jun 25 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Just signed up for my very first powerlifting meet, its in 9 weeks. I am in the middle of a 10 week program that will finish in 4 weeks. Once I finish that program I am planning on doing mostly heavy singles with some accessory movements for the last 4 weeks before the meet, then resting for the last week, thoughts?  I'm pretty nervous/excited for the meet. I am planning on totaling 1250-1300lbs at 181lb.   Is it much different squatting in front of all those people at the meet who are looking back at you? In the gym I squat facing the wall, I am thinking about working on the other side of the power rack so that I am facing out towards everyone else in the gym to see if it might help me get ready for the meet environment better."
powerlifting,3b2k7p,OmnipotentStudent,4,Thu Jun 25 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"The people aren't a big deal, but the commands can take some getting used to. Highly recommend training with the commands for some time, including really slow commands e.g. 3 seconds from unrack to ""squat"" command"
powerlifting,3b2k7p,MearCat,2,Thu Jun 25 16:00:47 2015 UTC,Yea recently I have started to say the commands in my head while I do my lifts to make sure I am used to the squat and bench commands and I dont cheat on any of the lifts.
powerlifting,3b2k7p,OmnipotentStudent,3,Thu Jun 25 16:04:17 2015 UTC,In a meet I have never actually noticed the people AFTER I unrack the weight. When I set up I kind of do. But by force of habit you're so focused on yourself you don't really notice those around you. Just focus on the head judge and you'll be fine.

It gave me a great idea of what I should pick for openers, which was reassuring having never competed before.  As far as squatting in front of people - honestly, you'll be so focused on the lift and the judge that everything else just kind of fades to black. Just remember to wait for commands. It really helps to have someone who can yell ""wait"" or ""hold it"" prior to racking."

If one was to run a 12 week linear periodization cycle like Ed Coan's Bench program that starts with 7 weeks of rep work + tons of accessories and ends with 5 weeks of triples and doubles, it seems reasonable to gain weight during the hypertrophy weeks and diet for the intensification weeks?

Chalk!!!!, deadlift jack, 4 areas to squat including a monolith, speakers to hook up your phone to play music, bumper plates for OLY lifts and people with the same goals. I hate deadlifting at her gym since the plates are rubber and hexagon (or maybe octagon) shaped and there is no jack to help load/unload the bar. Not sure there stance on chalk but my guess is no."

powerlifting,3aywxh,frankbunny,3,Fri Jun 26 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Although I'm not at a powerlifting specific gym, it is powerlifting friendly and not a chain gym.

powerlifting,3aywxh,Magic_warlock0-,46,Thu Jun 25 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"I went from a uni gym to a powerlifting gym. Being told that your 475 squat was 'pretty good' by a dude that squats 820 and can actually give you advice is amazing. Lifting with super strong people is the best.  Less ego, more seriousness."
powerlifting,3aywxh,Daveuall,44,Wed Jun 24 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"If that powerlifting gym has experienced, knowledgeable competitors, there's no better place to be for your training. Starting out is an especially useful time to be training in a gym like that; they know the ropes and can spot deficiencies in your technique far quicker and better than a commercial gym. NOt to mention, the camaraderie that you build up is fantastics; this is where the true friendships that develop in powerlifting derive from, truly. I'd highly advise joining this gym above the all-around one."
powerlifting,3aywxh,GeneralMillss,19,Wed Jun 24 16:54:36 2015 UTC,This so many times  The internet tries but it will never be a good enough substitute for the feedback you get from real lifters in real life
powerlifting,3aywxh,kanst,21,Wed Jun 24 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"The people.  They spot me without being asked. They wrap my knees. They help me load and unload. They keep me motivated. They keep my head straight. They keep me humble. They encourage me. They congratulate me. They commiserate with me. They eat with me, they drink with me, and they're my friends. And I can only hope that they see that I'm trying my best to give back to them what they've given to me."
powerlifting,3aywxh,GeneralMillss,15,Wed Jun 24 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"For me personally, I find it very motivating to be the weakest person in the gym. My gym has ~7 squat racks, 2 monolifts and like 5 deadlift platforms.  Anytime you go in there are people moving significant weight.   For me I find that motivating.  Also there is a deadlift bar, chalk all over the place, and tons of people who can help you if you need it."
powerlifting,3aywxh,popozion,14,Wed Jun 24 17:41:56 2015 UTC,It's a bit of an ego check when you realize that your working weight for the day is some guy's second warm up.

powerlifting,3aywxh,Daveuall,16,Fri Jun 26 06:56:30 2015 UTC,"I would change in a heartbeat.   More equipment available Better trainers / mentors / role models / motivation No bullshit posters advertising wellness seminars and holistic healing, or proclaiming ""sweat is fat crying"" Keeps your ego in check Chalk Allowed to make a bit of noise Better barbells, racks, etc. (better grip on the bars, more stable or adjustable racks and cages, etc.) Bumper plates"
powerlifting,3aywxh,Taunk,9,Wed Jun 24 18:55:17 2015 UTC,The Colosseum is pretty cool.  When I went there it wasn't really full on powerlifting but things may have changed.  It does have commercial gym equipment too which is sort of the best of both worlds compared to some PL garage gyms that don't have leg curls or lat pulldowns.    Really its just a better atmosphere which to me is one of the most important qualities in training overall
powerlifting,3aywxh,guyonthissite,8,Wed Jun 24 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"I was at a commercial gym for a number of years. Any time I squatted it was a spectacle. I did 405x5 and people lost their mind.   I went to a hardcore gym for the first time and watched a guy rep out 405 good mornings. It was a complete mental shift. Besides the tangible things like chalk, more experienced lifters, crew, etc. It is the big fish small pond mentality that will be dashed. You can play catch up to really strong people and it helps a lot.   If nothing else, try it out."
powerlifting,3aywxh,Daveuall,2,Thu Jun 25 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"That's like the only advantage of a normal gym. When I squat near max (for me that's 405), I get people congratulating me, people being in awe of me, people basically treated me like some sort of strength god.  On the other hand, if I did that at a powerlifting gym, I'd probably get advice on how to do it better. And that's a lot more important than praise."

I tried teaching myself and training in a commercial gym and thought I was doing alright. Went to check out an actual powerlifting gym in the area. Upon watching me on my first visit there, the owner tells me I needed a lot of work. He said my squad was a train wreck, I wasn't close with my bench, and he could write a thesis on my deadlift alone. Been training with him for about three months now and my form is light years better and I've gotten way stronger than I did in the four months alone at a commercial gym where form doesn't matter and everything is random."

powerlifting,3aywxh,ThatOldStuff,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"Colosseum is awesome.  I did a 3 month groupon there too, while having a membership at a commercial gym.  I like how serious everyone was about lifting. The overall atmosphere.   You are allowed to use chalk there. There is just a lot more equipment there that is helpful for powerlifting and Olympic lifting if that's your thing.  For example, I can't do block pulls at my commercial gym.   But when it comes down to it, I can do most of the same stuff at a commercial gym."

powerlifting,3axb5u,newtonism,14,Wed Jun 24 17:08:36 2015 UTC,"It's quite common for the guys at the very very top in the heavier weight classes to train less frequently than you'd think. 80% on squats when you're squatting over 1000 is a different story to when you're squatting 500. And since when they're at the very top they're generally not gonna build much (if any) more muscle, and their form is already at the level of mastery, increased frequency won't necessarily benefit them. I know the Lilliebridges only train like 3 times a week."

Playing around with grip widths can bring better results but width changes should be performed slowly over time as they are two very different techniques with different biomechanical requirements and different force output advantages and disadvantages.  Furthermore if you want to get better at bench and you haven't done this already, get off SL5x5, it sucks."

If you're still running well with linear programming then stick to it but you will get more out of more bench frequency definitely.  Also see here and here for other 5/3/1 variations.  What bodyweight are you?
powerlifting,3awmz7,Linguist_Music,2,Wed Jun 24 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"You mentioned doing the OHP as assistance in the comment you linked - how would you program that? Just do some sets of OHP once you finish benching, or do them on off days?"
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,2,Wed Jun 24 13:32:36 2015 UTC,"You can see he has regular bench on day A, and close grip bench + OHP on day B. I did something a little different, regular bench on day A and OHP + dips on day B. Really helped my chest and benching."
powerlifting,3awmz7,molly_kid,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"I am also doing this kind of split.  The dips+OHP on day B works tremendously for my triceps (and my chest, from dips).  On day A, I bench my 5/3/1 and also do 5 sets x 10-20 reps for seated dumbbell OHP.  That gets my shoulders sore as hell."
powerlifting,3awmz7,moldeh,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:07:11 2015 UTC,"Currently 190lbs, but intend to get to sub 163lbs and stay there once I get to a 1RM bench of 315lbs.  I also bench 3 times a week with variations, but I'll probably run 5/3/1 for awhile again. Thanks."
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,3,Thu Jun 25 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"You can't just move your grip out like that so quickly and see improvement. Most people recommend moving your grip out 1 finger each training cycle and it's how I did it myself. When I tried to go from shoulder wide to pinkies on the rings I felt weak, got shoulder pain and ended up being constantly flared out way more than was strong [or safe for my shoulders] for my leverages; I just instinctively started touching on the nipples because I was too used to having better strength at the bottom [which is what a close grip gives you]. Needless to say, that was way too high of a touch point for me and it really fucked my bench progress for a while.  I moved it back in, then over 3-4 months I went from pinkies 1 finger width away from the rings to 2 fingers inside the rings and I've also put like 40 lb on bench in the meanwhile. Although that also had to do with increasing my bench frequency, improving my arch, etc.  But, yeah, I don't think it's smart to try to make big changes in your grip in a short time period, because it changes a lot of things, most notably the bar path. Imagine if you went from months of doing conventional to doing sumo overnight. I know, it's not the same thing, but it's similar in the sense that foot width can make huge changes to the movement."
powerlifting,3awmz7,moldeh,2,Wed Jun 24 11:34:11 2015 UTC,"Where is your touch point when doing wide grip now, and where was it with the narrower grip? I've always done wide grip (two fingers inside the rings) but recently started getting shoulder pain, probably from flaring my elbows and a too-high touch point. I can't keep my shoulders tucked enough with my grip out that far to prevent pain so I switched to a narrower grip. Not really sure where I should bring it to my chest."
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,3,Wed Jun 24 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"Right now, with 2 fingers inside the rings, I touch right below my pecs, basically like maybe an inch or less below where my pecs end, about 6 cm below my nipples, the bar grazes the top ab. Not too low compared to some people, but it's not like your goal should be to touch as low as possible. If I go any lower I feel too weak.  When I was doing close grip, it was a little lower, basically touching right on my top ab if I remember correctly. However, in all honesty it was probably too low. My elbows were basically touching my sides and my arch was like 1/3 or what it is now [plus it was all coming from my naturally flexible back and zero leg/hip drive], so my bench was overall pretty shitty.   I think your problem comes from doing too much touch and go. If you do a lot of touch and go, then you can ride on the stretch reflex and just stay basically constantly flared, having a bar path that's close to straight. You just use the stretch reflex and the higher touch point to give you speed off the bottom, so you're never forced to touch a little lower and have your elbows to go from somewhat tucked at the bottom to flared at the top.  I've also seen that with a lot of people in person and I've had a lot of others mention it, as well. However, if you pause, that usually stops. That's how it worked with me and my training partner. We started doing more paused work and it fixed itself. When you pause the bar on your chest, you naturally touch lower and tuck a bit when it touches your chest to keep the elbows underneath it.  I think that if you dedicate a few weeks to doing only paused work and then move on to doing most of your work paused and leaving the TnG work for assistance, you should be able to find your sweet spot. And don't expect to be super tucked, or even stay tucked for the entire lift. You tuck as much as you need to on the way down to touch where you need to touch and then as the bar comes up you slowly flare on the way to the top.  As for where that spot will be, you can't know, as it's a combination of your arch [mine is pretty decent right now, especially since I added oly shoes] and your anthropometry, as well as leverages etc. Let your PAUSED form dictate your TnG form.  If you already do that or if you do that and it doesn't work, then you can move on to a closer grip. However, you'd still need to find your sweet spot for the touch point. If you're not touching low with a massive arch and a gut, it's probably going to be around the xiphoid process, like for most people, but you can't know where before you try. You'd still need to do paused work to see where you feel the strongest without getting any shoulder pain."
powerlifting,3awmz7,moldeh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"If you do a lot of touch and go, then you can ride on the stretch reflex and just stay basically constantly flared, having a bar path that's close to straight.    That makes so much sense, I think you're exactly right. I do almost exclusively touch and go and I'm a lot stronger with flared elbows. I will try only paused benching for the next few weeks and see what happens.  Regarding your arch, you say that it came mostly from your back flexibility rather than your hips/leg drive. I think I might be in that position. My arch collapses a bit when I unrack the bar and somewhat at the top of each rep. Do I just need to focus on getting my legs/hips into it more?"
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"I think that how effective your arch is gonna be has to do with 2 factors. First off, back flexibility. You need to bring your shoulderblades together and extend your thoracic spine as much as possible. You also hyperextend your lumbar spine a bit, which also sets your body in position to use leg drive.  The next step is to actually use leg drive. You need your heels as far back as possible. You hyperextend the hips and that flexes the glutes all the way, which brings your body up since you only have 2 touch points with the bench, your upper back and your ass, and you're bringing the second one higher up.  A lot of people don't really do the second part, though. They arch their back but they don't flex their glutes, they just have their feet down for stability and that's it. If you want your arch to be as big as possible, then you need your feet as far back and close to you as they can be WITHOUT your ass rising off the bench during the set.  I actually first set my back up and get under the bar before I start using leg drive, because I go to a commercial gym and the benches are slippery. If I try to drive with my legs without any resistance I just fly off the bench.  As for your arch collapsing, that's mostly from trying to do the part of the range of motion at the top that the arch naturally stops you from. When you unrack, either get someone to give you liftoff, or try to grip the bar as tight as possible when unracking [which is also a decent cue during the set imo] and just accept the fact that you can't unlock your shoulderblades to make the liftoff easier. It's just practice, I think. If you're in control of the movement when repping out a weight, you should be able to lock out just fine without needing to collapse your arch just to get it up. The only time you'd ever want to unlock your shoulderblades a bit would be after you've finished your set, if you want to rerack the weight but are scared of hitting the j-hooks [tfw using a shitty commercial gym bench]. But, yeah, you never want to fuck your arch up during the set, because it's impossible to get it back up without resetting."
powerlifting,3awmz7,moldeh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Dude, thank you so much for the advice. I think the pain was caused by shitty bench form but the problem now runs a bit deeper and it's going to take more work than just correcting my form to fix. I just took a lengthy break from benching and after a single, light session (with my previous shitty form) I've got tender bicep tendons and a minor dull pain radiating to my biceps.  I tried out getting my arch set up with my glutes and legs squeezed, noticed a huge difference. Haven't tried actually benching with anything but the bar like that yet."
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to get bicep tendon 'soreness' all the time from benching, as well as shoulder ache. Now, if it's not gone in a couple of days, that could be a tear in the tendon, but my understanding is that tearing the short bicep tendon from benching is actually a relatively easy injury to make a full recovery from [compared to like a shoulder injury that needs surgery and up to a year or more before you can do anything]. Obviously not every tear is the same, etc, but that's what I've heard. Although I don't think you've actually torn anything, cause you'd have some pretty serious pain. If it doesn't go away, go to a doctor obviously.  I think that programs that feature relatively less intensity, higher frequency, high weekly volume can be very helpful in situations like this one [obviously sheiko but there's a lot of others]. Lots of high quality reps with medium weight minimizes injury risk and maximizes form quality, which really helps if you're trying to change the way you're doing an exercise. Especially if you're just starting to use leg drive, practising the new setup for every single set, including your warm ups and all the super easy sets, can be a huge help."
powerlifting,3awmz7,LoopyDood,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"I've had this pain recurring for a while, I think it's actually the long head tendon. Hopefully it's just tendinitis, but it's still possible it's a tear or even more serious shit like a labrum injury. Could also be caused by a rotator cuff injury, I have a couple of other symptoms that point to that. It tends to go away when I stop benching but comes back after I start again.  I'm going to see a doctor about it soon (including a nagging knee issue)."
powerlifting,3awmz7,moldeh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm not so sure what tendon it is. It's pretty easy to feel, seems to run all the way down my shoulder between my anterior and lateral deltoids when I have my arm perpendicular to my torso in front of me (relaxed). I can't really pinpoint where it attaches. Sound familiar?"
powerlifting,3awmz7,black_angus1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:29:59 2015 UTC,Oh and try to look at the unracking as a straight arm pulldown or a pullover kinda movement. That might help you out.

powerlifting,3awmz7,BenchPolkov,-4,Wed Jun 24 21:01:11 2015 UTC,This.
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,8,Wed Jun 24 10:21:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, wider can make for a better bench, but there can be too wide just like there can be too close. The key is finding the widest point that your forearm is still at a 90° to the floor. I'd get a video from the front of the bench and look at the angle of your forearms see what you think. If it looks right it could be you just haven't spent enough at that grip width to see the improvement."
powerlifting,3awmz7,BenchPolkov,5,Wed Jun 24 03:16:15 2015 UTC,I'd actually adjust that to 90° or more to the floor. For full wide benchers who are powerful off the chest having your forearm angle at more than 90° begins to reduce the ROM even more.
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,5,Wed Jun 24 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"That's a rule that can definitely be followed for equipped lifting. It's less likely to be the most effective for a raw lifter, but that's just my opinion plus everyone is different and there's always exceptions."
powerlifting,3awmz7,BenchPolkov,2,Wed Jun 24 04:24:55 2015 UTC,"You see it a bit amongst the lighter lifters with the big archers and very often amongst the japanese who generally own wide-grip benching. I definitely do it myself too, even on the chest my forearms are probably at 95° at least and lifters with shorter arms will be at an even larger angle.  There would definitely be a point of diminishing returns though as the bigger the angle the less tricep power would be possible."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,2,Wed Jun 24 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah i definitely see it, even coaching a guy now with a very wide grip. Hes very short and barrel chested so it works for him. Most guys I'd probably play with it some though."
powerlifting,3awmz7,BenchPolkov,2,Wed Jun 24 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, its not a recommendation for everybody. I think it needs a thick chest or really good arch to make it work, and A LOT of power off the chest."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Exci_,2,Wed Jun 24 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's where my grip is at where I currently feel strongest. The wider grip put my forearm angle at obtuse."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,5,Wed Jun 24 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"Same, as a long armed lifter obtuse forearm angle makes it difficult for me to create a lot of power. Before tearing my pec I was pinky on the line where I felt strongest. Now at the top it puts a lot of stress on my torn pec so I've moved out two finger widths. While its perhaps not my strongest grip width I've adapted to make it work, it took almost 6 months though to get comfortable after changing."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Exci_,3,Wed Jun 24 08:31:31 2015 UTC,See my above comment about the obtuse angle not exactly being a bad thing BUT you need to be a powerful bencher off the chest to do it well.
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"The key is finding the widest point that your forearm is still at a 90° to the floor.   But.. Wouldn't that point always be ""arms completely flared"" ? loose representation (assume blue path is where forearms are vertical)"
powerlifting,3awmz7,Exci_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:20:18 2015 UTC,No at 90 to the floor it's very easy to tuck the elbow just needs to be an effort from the lift to do so. I would also consider that tucked in the image you provided too.
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yes the hands in the picture are tucked of course, I meant that the widest point of this half-circle is if his arms were flared to the point where they essentially form a line."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Exci_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:36:53 2015 UTC,Well of course they form a line you'll be holding a barbell
powerlifting,3awmz7,Mdisbrow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe that wasn't clear enough. I'm saying widest point where forearm is still 90° to the floor would look like this concerning arm position regardless of the person's body, which of course is far from what we want with tucking. I guess I'm being pedantic."
powerlifting,3awmz7,AeonCatalyst,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Well the first picture compared to what you just posted are totally different. The first picture has elbows tucked the second has the elbows flared. The first is the correct way to bench the second is a novice and no matter where his hand placement it's wrong, he's not tucking his elbows in the slightest.  This video basically covers the difference between tucked shoulder and elbows and untucked, which has little to do with hand position and more to do with a retracted scapula.

powerlifting,3awmz7,TheAesir,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"The first picture was supposed to show the angles that forearms are vertical (the blue path as I described), which showed that the widest of those angles is with arms totally flared. Anyway."
powerlifting,3awmz7,lHeeerO,2,Wed Jun 24 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"You're not understanding, you are assuming your elbows are to stay inline with your shoulders, they're not. To maintain 90° in the forearm while having a wide grip the elbow should come down inline with the lower pec/sternum where your bar path should be for an optimal bench press. When this happens it allows your forearm to stay perpendicular to the floor in a straight line.   Start this at 2:20 https://youtu.be/WGLD8nVLyhE. Notice my elbows and and humerus move down towards my chest while my forearm maintains a straight up and down line giving me 90° to the floor.  Another video different angle so you can see how straight up and down the forearm stays (can't see the position if the elbows as well but trust me they're tucking to come inline with my sternum to maintain that posture. https://youtu.be/WbVKYYCaJ48 start is at about 30 seconds.  If you're still not understanding I'm not sure how to make it more clear."
powerlifting,3awmz7,powerliftinglife,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:50:22 2015 UTC,Actually with a big arch being completely flared would require you to have your elbows BEHIND your neck because the range of motion would be so deep. My elbows would literally be at an acute angle at that point.
powerlifting,3awmz7,cainmichky,2,Fri Jun 26 13:51:39 2015 UTC,"In the long run a wider grip has a greater potential to be stronger as there's a greater potential amount of muscle to recruit. When I made the transition it took a whole summer of extremely high volume starting at roughly 75% of my bench max. Since making the transition, I'm added 60+lbs to my bench after being stalled for better part of a year."
powerlifting,3awmz7,Checkers10160,2,Wed Jun 24 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"Getting stronger at a variation usually builds the main movement.  Close grip builds a bigger bench, wide grip has that same potential.  Work on building your weak points and your lifts will go up."
powerlifting,3awmz7,cainmichky,2,Wed Jun 24 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"Altogether, I think there is an argument (from a powerlifting perspective) that the shorter ROM is going to make the lift 'easier' and EVENTUALLY make you stronger. It's worth noting that this may take months rather than weeks, depending on your level of advancement.   That is not, however, to say that this will be ideal or even suitable for every lifter. Many lifters (eg KK) bench with virtually close grip form. I like Brandon Lilly's analogy: if you were going to punch someone you wouldn't swing with your arm way out to your side, you would push from closer to the chest; a closer grip will likely be more explosive for many people.   Another point to consider is that the length of your arms will tend to dictate the grip width which allows you a more effective bar path and even the right amount of elbow flare (if you do bench with a small amount of flare).   In the end, there are no absolutes here.  Don't always chase a shorter range of motion for the sake of a shorter range of motion, make sure there are other reasons behind the change. Ultimately, use the form which allows you to progress in a comfortable, consistent and pain free manner.  Hope this was somewhat useful  PS To me it's odd that you experience wrist pain with the wider grip as I have always associated it with closer grip benching. Just individual differences I imagine"
powerlifting,3awmz7,Goodchuck,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:44 2015 UTC,"No, I would think it depends whether you're pecs or triceps dominate your bench. I do better with a closer grip. Also, since you have been using a close grip, your chest strength may be lacking and would take a good amount of time to catch up. If you continued with a wide grip your bench would probably go up due to your chest strength increasing."
powerlifting,3awmz7,ejb30,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"So if my bench is heavily tricep dominant, I would want to focus on wide grip, right?"

If you're just getting started, play around with different widths to see what is comfortable for you. Although, it wouldn't hurt to train wide grip if you're main focus is narrow or vise versa."

powerlifting,3awmz7,ejb30,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"I bench more narrow simply because I train narrow. Better to have triceps as the limiting factor than your shoulder, I believe dave tate or louie simmons suggested a somewhat narrow approach."

powerlifting,3awmz7,squabanchedleft,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:59:34 2015 UTC,Shoulder injuries are generally worse and more common. Having triceps as the limiting factor will help reduce the chances of you rotating the shoulder and wrecking something.

I was kind of hoping to have a chance to get a few words out of Belyaev with the help of my Russian friend (who was their translator for the tour) but never got a chance.  Some friends from other stops in the tour (who actually got to interact with them a bit more) said he was just a bit rude to people and was the same at GPA Worlds. All 2nd hand info of course.  In their defense none of the Russians wanted to be there or compete at the meet. Why risk injury at a shitty meet in Australia when you can make a shitload of money at Super Cup or Battle of Champs.

powerlifting,3ax8gu,BenchPolkov,4,Thu Jun 25 07:47:13 2015 UTC,"No money in it.   Basically in Russia the IPF is the pinnacle and is considered very prestigious. Champions can apparently get some sort of sponsorship but most will still have to work to support themselves but can become coaches at the end of their lifting career and live off that.   If lifters are banned they still have the pro comps like Super Cup/Battle of Champs and now Sarychev's WRPF (it will be interesting to see who competes there) but I don't think many of the ex-IPF lifters think the other feds like GPC/GPA/WPC are worth competing at.  This may not all be 100% accurate, its what I've managed to piece together from numerous sources."

powerlifting,3atmch,FatbutSwole,18,Tue Jun 23 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"How strict are USAPL meets in terms of equipment checks? I'm not necessarily talking belts or knee sleeves (everything I have in those regards is ""IPF Approved""), but what about my singlet? And, the real Tard part, are you allowed to wear compression shorts underneath your singlet? What are the IPF/USAPL approved underpants?  This may seem like a tongue-in-cheek question, but I assure you it is not. I'll be competing in USAPL in September, and the last thing I want is to buy the membership, pay the meet fees, kill myself peaking, drive ~5 hours to this meet, then not be allowed to lift because of my damned underwear.  Thanks in advance."
powerlifting,3atmch,frak8757,9,Tue Jun 23 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"You'll need to wear briefs. Nothing with a leg, so compression shorts are out.  As for singlets, USAPL is not generally following the IPF singlet rules. I would generally suggest contacting your meet director to confirm this, but since I know you're doing the SBWC meet I can tell you that they did not follow IPF singlet rules at their spring meet and I wore a sparkly outer space print singlet. Even raw nationals is not requiring that your singlet be from the approved list, so I don't think it will be an issue. Your other equipment does need to be IPF approved though, as you mentioned."

I'd assume the bigger and more prestigious the meet, the strictrr they'd be, but that doesn't mean you couldn't have a strict local check either. Fwiw, my meet (~120 people competing) was strict with everything - most of my stuff was obviously branded, like an Inzer singlet or Converses, so no measuring required. I did bring a bra that was not USAPL approved and the guy shrugged and let me keep it.  That being said, for stuff like underwear or socks, I'd bring what you want to wear and a backup that you are confident will be approved, just in case."

It is one of the higher caffeinated ones on the market which is both a plus and a minus in the sense that once you develop a tolerance, you are now tolerant to 600mg doses at once if you take two scoops which is getting to be on the ridiculous side.   Also it tastes like shit.   But yet I really enjoyed it when I worked out at 5 in the morning everyday."

powerlifting,3atmch,TheAesir,8,Tue Jun 23 18:20:21 2015 UTC,I really like doing bent over rows with the EZ bar with my back completely horizontal.  It makes it very easy to activate my traps and rhomboids.  It also makes it simple to switch between narrow and wide grips depending on whether I want to hit my lats or not.  The 'tarded part of this is - I don't see anyone talking about doing rows like this.  Is this a Pendlay row?  Is this just a bent over row?  It's definitely a fuck-me-in-the-arse row.  What exercise am I doing?  I really like it.

powerlifting,3atmch,Lavistao,15,Tue Jun 23 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"Man, I suck at this. I've always been shitty at sports, but since picking up powerlifting (or basic barbell strength training, since I've never competed), I feel like I'm taking a beating both physically and emotionally. The grind has me feel like a weak kitten-shit, and while I'm much bigger and stronger than most people, I don't feel ""healthy"" or ""fit"". Even having these thoughts makes me feel like I don't have the mental toughness to actually be a real powerlifter. Am I just being an emo-tard, or is does all this come with the territory?"
powerlifting,3atmch,levirules,41,Tue Jun 23 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"My brother, everything is gonna be ok. What is a ""real"" powerlifter anyway? Not everyone is born to smash world records or to grind at this sport every day. Ultimately, powerlifting, in my opinion, is the pursuit of improving yourself. Physical strength improvements are awesome. But there comes a point when you've burnt out your emotional and mental strength at the cost of that physical strength. And then your body will not thank you for it. You are most certainly not an emo-tard, as most lifters experience even a little bit of this feeling you've described. Powerlifting is to improve yourself. If you're not feeling healthy or fit, then evaluate what you're doing. The guys at the top of this sport aren't objectively healthy. They know they are willingly sacrificing long-term health for peak human strength. If you're not going to be the best in the world, or you don't want to make this sport the only thing in your life, that's fine! Be healthy! Be happy! Run, swim, play some pick up ball, whatever. Do what makes you healthy and satisfied. Don't think that powerlifting has to be all ""grind"" and no fun. Ultimately, this sport is fun, and that's why I do it. So have some fun with your life, my friend."

Push through it to a certain extent, but not if it's making you miserable.  Go for a bike ride, do a yoga class, buy a hula hoop - whatever.

powerlifting,3atmch,Metallicadpa,7,Tue Jun 23 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"I am retarded and need an ELI5 please.  My elbows kill me. I figured out what I was doing wrong squatting (low bar, not enough shoulder engagement when racking, essentially dumping hundreds of pounds on my elbows very quickly while in a compromised position and not paying attention) and benching (bringing the bar down too high on my chest, making for a shitty elbow angle).  The only thing left is deadlift. Every time I go heavy, my elbows kill me. Are there common form issues that cause this, and if so, what? If it is just heavy ass weight hurting weak joints, what is a good way to condition elbows? Or do I just harden the fuck up and hurt for two days every time I put more than 375lbs on the bar?"
powerlifting,3atmch,TheAesir,17,Tue Jun 23 13:46:35 2015 UTC,Do you do much in the way of curls? High volume hammer curls work through any niggles of pain in my elbows.

powerlifting,3atmch,TheAesir,5,Tue Jun 23 15:08:52 2015 UTC,I would do these if they didn't hurt my wrists for sure. Curls are magical for elbow pain. Leg curls have the same impact on my knee pain now.

powerlifting,3atmch,JohnTesh,5,Tue Jun 23 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"Mark Bell's compression cuffs have helped me tremendously for during workout pains. I actually haven't had much elbow pain since I've gotten them and I only use them when they start feeling bad.   Try out a couple of weeks of high bar squatting and don't necessarily have a narrow grip, you can have your hands wide and still do high bar. That will take a lot of pressure off your elbows and allow them to recover. Benching will be a little harder to avoid, but maybe with the low bar squatting reduced, benching will feel okay.   Also, increased biceps work seems to have helped me."
powerlifting,3atmch,Teekam,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:11 2015 UTC,"I got the squat and bench figured out, and I am pain free there. It's just the deadlift that I have left to figure out, but I don't know what I am doing since my arms stay straight and I don't pull with my biceps or anything.

I've never had elbow pain due to deadlifts, but I've seen people use the compression cuffs while deadlifting too. Sometimes elbow pain can stem from forearm tightness as well. If you look up stretches for elbow pain, it's almost always movements/stretches at the wrist."

powerlifting,3atmch,Blakeh39,3,Tue Jun 23 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"When I would go to rack the bar, I would bring my shoulders forward towards the rack subconsciously, disengaging my back and shoulder tightness, transferring the weight from my back to my hands, essentially dropping a few hundred pounds on each elbow as I moved forward to rack. Once I consciously kept a tight back while racking, no more elbow pain during squats."
powerlifting,3atmch,JohnTesh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure what's causing your elbow pain or how to condition them, but you might want to try out the Slingshot compression cuffs over your elbows and see if that helps at all. I bought one a couple weeks back for my right elbow since it's started giving me trouble when I bench, so I've just been putting it on for my top working sets and it makes a world of difference. No pain at all. Seen plenty of people throw the cuffs on for deadlifts too. They're pretty inexpensive, I think they run for $15 on Mark Bell's website."

powerlifting,3atmch,JohnTesh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Try wrapping your wrists for low-bar squats, like you would for bench. It's not uncommon on the platform. Sounds counterintuitive, but the wrists hyperextending under load can cause inflammation at the elbow tendons.  This fixed my elbows when I couldn't bench an empty bar from pain, and no problems since. Now I start wrapping halfway through my warmups."

powerlifting,3atmch,MonstarGaming,5,Tue Jun 23 23:21:14 2015 UTC,What do you guys/girls think about exercise order as it relates to powerlifting specificity. Like should there ever be a time were benching should come before squatting in a training session?
powerlifting,3atmch,Fudgms,6,Tue Jun 23 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it really matters what order you do the lifts in terms of ""powerlifting specificity""  I personally bench before I squat most of the time because if I do it the other way around my shoulders don't handle the bench volume as well. Also if you if you look at Sheiko cycles you'll see Boris often programs bench before squats whenever he writes double bench sessions.  Also if you've got a high volume bench session and a lower volume squats then it'd probably be smarter to do the squats last so that you have more energy to bench."
powerlifting,3atmch,PM_ME_UR_BEST_LIFTS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"From what i remember his reasoning behind having bench squat bench, squat bench squat, etc wasnt for specificity purposes but rather to split up the work load so that you can maintain good form for all lifts instead of having it go to shit half way through."
powerlifting,3atmch,skwaats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:01:34 2015 UTC,That's my thought as well. Essentially a rest in between so you can keep form and lift more.
powerlifting,3atmch,ceejayess,4,Tue Jun 23 22:38:20 2015 UTC,"I think the answer is absolutely, but implementation depends on your programming. While squat or deadlift usually get priority over bench (since they are ""harder""), I like to bench first on heavy bench days if my squat and deadlift are medium and light. Doing you heaviest movement has obvious advantages for powerlifting (right...?), but if you don't use a H/M/L setup, program more than the big three, or have multiple medium-intensity days (for example), organizing your training sessions can get very complicated very quickly."
powerlifting,3atmch,NOREGRETSLOL,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:10:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I see the point your making with pushing your heavy lift while fresh.
powerlifting,3atmch,Catechin,2,Tue Jun 23 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"If squatting is beating up your elbows, it would make sense to bench first. Some people feel very strongly that training lifts should be done  in competition order but I'd argue that you're trying to get stronger on all three lifts, not constantly fatigue yourself by placing the squat first and foremost at all times."
powerlifting,3atmch,NOREGRETSLOL,5,Tue Jun 23 13:29:51 2015 UTC,Was college student never did any serious warming up or mobility and was fine.   Am now employed and  working 12 hour days confined to a desk. Squats and deadlifts and bench arch feel like shit.   What exactly does sitting in a chair do to my hips legs back that make them feel tight and shitty and how can I change my warm up / mobility to counter the fact I spend my life sitting in a chair?
powerlifting,3atmch,paohana,6,Tue Jun 23 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"Sitting at a chair shortens your hip flexors, making your quads and hips tight as hell.  Do a general warm-up first, I rather like dynamic stretching.  Just kinda flail about and get warm.  Then, my typical routine for pre-squat days is:   Banded couch stretch Banded hamstring stretch (keep your front/banded leg straight and back as straight as you can, though) Banded groin/hip stretch   So, pre-workout I'll push to near end range of motion on each of those and just rock back and forth for 10-15 seconds.  It shouldn't be a full on static stretch, but you want to kind of loosen things up at the end.  Once or twice a week when I do my full mobility work (typically at home) then I'll actually hang out at end of range with those for a minute or two and try to expand my ROM.  If you don't have a band you can still do those stretches fine, I just find a band makes them orders of magnitude more effective.  For your arch, I find mobility work over a foam roller is the best.  Just lie with the foam roller on your back and extend over it and hang out until your ROM improves.  Rinse and repeat for different portions of your back.  Stretching your hip flexors/quads will help, too.  Highly recommend picking up Becoming a Supple Leopard, by the way.  Fantastic book."

powerlifting,3atmch,--tomo,3,Tue Jun 23 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"If one is benching frequently (I'm thinking bench on mon-wed-fri and OHP on tue-thu) it's important to leave a few reps in the tank each time, right?

It doesn't stress your spine as much as a traditional deadlift. But I haven't used it to replace my deads because it's just not the same movement. Like if you struggle with locking out your deadlift, for example, the trap bar won't help with that.   I've also used the trap bar for shrugs, as someone else said. I also tried it for rows once.

Didn't get wrist wraps until I was benching over 315. Never got knee sleeves. Never used knee wraps until I was over a 455, never had real good knee wraps until the night before my last meet. Never bought powerlifting-specific shoes.  The equipment doesn't make a lifter."
powerlifting,3atmch,Fudgms,2,Tue Jun 23 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"If it helps any, the order I ended up getting stuff was belt>oly shoes>sleeves but that's because of how my body responded to what I was doing, injuries, and figuring out what I'm built for. For example I lifted low bar in chucks and a belt for a long time, and kept having hip issues. Switched to highbar to try it and loved it, but I had broken my ankle years prior and didn't have the mobility in one ankle. That led to buying oly shoes. My knees are fucked from football so I then looked into sleeves to keep them warm between sets. And that's my setup now. Still deadlift and bench in chucks. And wrist wraps are wrist wraps I figure they are pretty much a preference item. It all depends on your body, your goals, and honestly your wallet. None of these things are necessary in the least but I'd just go at it from a logical point of view if I were you."

I did just purchase an inzer belt and I use it every now and again on heavy sets, but I could have probably waited another year... I just had extra cash and wanted a new weightlifting toy like the big kids have.   I use the wrist wraps on heavy OHP or dumbbell presses."

powerlifting,3atmch,Not_Jimi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"Guess one is that it's a weak link in the chain and so it's giving you grief because it can't handle the load on it.  The other option is the complete reverse, where it's the strong link in the chain and the rest of your muscles can't handle the load on them, so you're compensating with your back. In the case of goblet squats, they require a lot of core strength. It's pretty normal for people to lack core strength and compensate with their back... perhaps try strengthening that."

The advice I was given before my first comp squat was to make sure I didn't do exactly what you said (don't go as soon as they say squat). I think it's a common newbie 'trap' (though they aren't trying to trap you) to rush and squat instantly. You don't have to rush though. Take a second, take a deep breath and descend when you're ready. If you watch the pros they always take their final breath (or several) after the 'squat' call."

powerlifting,3atmch,CrazySwayze82,2,Tue Jun 23 20:49:32 2015 UTC,When you start peaking for a meet focus on whichever one you are better at. I just wasn't feeling sumo style leading up to my last meet so I trained conventional for the heavy lifts but still did sumo for volume.

powerlifting,3atmch,zebrake2010,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:21:29 2015 UTC,novice: do linear progression adding weight 3x week (e.i. greyskull) or do a lot of heavy volume and progress only once a week (e.i. recently released greg nuckols novice routine)

powerlifting,3atmch,czi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"I have a question. I have been back in the gym finally after a couple year break. I'm doing SL and on week 7 (all in all I've been back lifting for about 3 months though). Not really following the weigh tiering system but getting heavier weight each week so I'm feeling good. I'm doing A2G squats and absolutely love them, but my knee just got a slight tweet in it. I suspect I may have locked on the top of my squat and slight hyperextended it, although I didn't feel anything while squatting. It's not painful really, but I know it's there. I squatted today (cautiously) and did my normal weight no problem.   My question is am I being overly concerned or have y'all felt this same tweek? I've been icing a few times a day just to be safe, but I just really don't want it to fail me half way through a set and turn into something major."

powerlifting,3atmch,kraken514,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"I did Smolov JR for bench press. My previous max was 115 kg (in competition). I asked around here what weight to input for S JR, and everyone said 110 kg would be good. I went with 112,5. For increments I could choose between 2,5 or 5 kg. I went with 5 kg for both increments. I completed every single rep in the program.  When I tested my 1RM a week after, I could grind out 117,5 but not 120.  I'm sort of disappointed. Hoped for more. At the same time, an increment is an increment. What do you guys say?"

Its possible that your body just doesnt adapt well to the volume and intensity of smolov, id say try another program or figure out where your weak points are and try to make them strengths"

I train hard in the gym but I'm always spilling my wheels because I'm basically eating fruit snacks ice cream and caffeine all day.  I look back I've been lifting 15 years almost but I know people lifting 2-3 who are already passing me.  I just can't seem to day in and day out do it
powerlifting,3atmch,THADDEU,4,Tue Jun 23 18:56:50 2015 UTC,I have a compliance issue too so I hired a coach. Might I suggest being accountable to someone else? Maybe get a few friends and start sharing your myfitnesspal logs every day. Each time someone misses macros more than 5g in any direction you pay a dollar into a pot.

powerlifting,3atmch,squabanchedleft,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:26:02 2015 UTC,Seconded on myfitnesspal. Just get the app on your phone and follow your macros closely during the day. If you want treat you have to realise that it means you have to sacrifice something else late.  And do you have a cheat day or meal factored in? This can make a big difference mentally if you're having problems with discipline.

I totally but force production per lean mass is the same across men and women, and even that estrogen allows for quicker recovery, but if the only advantage men have is moderate duration bursts of power, why do men almost universally carry more lean mass per unit of height?  Anyway, shower thoughts I guess. The meat of the article was solid."

powerlifting,3atpwv,JohnTesh,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"yeah, I think what they mean is simply that female muscle is not biologically weaker than male muscle, there's just typically less of it. So when comparing advantages they're talking about the muscles themselves, and not the overall person. But that's not terribly clear in the wording.  Greg has a really good article on the topic"
powerlifting,3atpwv,frak8757,3,Tue Jun 23 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty good read:  http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/natural-muscular-potential-women/  tl;dr - test isn't actually THAT important (especially with higher estrogen allowing for higher training volumes via protective mechanisms and recovery-promoting mechanisms), and women can proportionately gain about as much muscle as men, though they can a smaller absolute amount because they're starting with less to begin with (though the pubertal surge in test IS the biggest reason for the differences in muscle mass pre-lifting).  When you actually graph the WRs in WL, you find that where the weight classes overlap, men lift 18-25% more relative to body weight than women:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/isvgnhta3ygmlyi/Screenshot%202015-06-23%2022.40.58.png?dl=0 (the orange line is the proportional difference between the lines of best fit.  I threw out the SHWs because they were outliers in both data sets.  From ~50-75 where the classes overlap, the differences is 18-25%)  About 10% of that can be explained by differences in essential fat, then the other 8-15% are mostly attributable to muscle mass differences.  Not really as big as most people assume."

powerlifting,3aux0i,Mdisbrow,6,Tue Jun 23 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking what's your name? I might know you I live off Roberts and used to train my bodybuilding days at that metro. Lexen runs about $50 a month for new memebers and more than likely you'll need to work around a groups training schedule. We currently have 6-8 men and 4 women that regularly train with me sun/tues/thursday/sat. Which is great, the problem is we only have 2 deadlift platforms and 3 benches. The girls can't train on the same equipment as the guys without unloading tons of weight and really slow the guys down. So there's only ever 2 benches available and sometimes 1 deadlift platform. Squats are less of an issue, we have 4 monolifts so plenty of room for a lot of people. My point is if you plan to train as a raw lifter at lexen you've gotta be able to keep up. That means at least squatting in the 500's unwrapped, benching somewhere close to at least 365, and pulling north of 500. We've got a great crew though 3 pros and 2 elites spanning 181-308, I've squatted over 800 close to a dozen times, 3 guys squat mid 700's (hopefully 800 soon), 4 guys comfortably benching 400-450 with me benching north of 500, 4 guys pulling over 700 with one guy approaching 800 (780), one 2100lb total with hopefully two more 2k+ coming this year. Our girls all have elite or pro totals too from 132 up, squatting 300+, benching 200+, and pulling mid 300 to mid 400.  Expect to be held accountable to showing up and training too. Last thing I want is someone that doesn't take training seriously. We've dropped a handful of guys over the last year that thought they were tough who didn't put the work in.  If anything about that doesn't sound doable there's always the doghouse in Columbus, but they are pretty much a group of misfits and fat chicks with the exception of one guy (Jonathan Harder 1750@181 raw)."

powerlifting,3at7f1,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 23 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, pause squats are great and I love them for teaching explosiveness out of the whole, maintaining rigidity, and for increasing quadricep time under tension.    Related to the topic of pausing but in the context of bench I supposed I'd ask you of all people: How do you feel about so many people running SL and SS not incorporating any paused bench into any of their bench days?  I realize that many who run these programs are beginners but I still feel as though an important part of bench training is delayed for much too long by ignoring the pause."
powerlifting,3at7f1,rdavis4559,11,Tue Jun 23 14:15:45 2015 UTC,I think paused bench is very important to practice if powerlifting is your goal.  Of course if powerlifting is your goal (and in general) I also think SS and SL are shit programs.
powerlifting,3at7f1,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 23 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"That is a good point in the distinction between goals.  I agree with you on SS and SL being shit programs; despite that, when I'm at the gym or when I find myself in a public setting immediately after a training session and I'm still wearing compression shorts and a tank I do occasionally have people come up to me and ask for advice.  These people are typically of the sort who are total beginners, ask you loaded questions, and start to become less interested or intimidated when you provide intelligent and precise advice on how to optimize training based on their goals (and degrade their shit bodybuilding.com workouts in the nicest way).  As most people lose interest or become sullen about how much thought and work is truly required I end up giving the easiest answer by saying that SL has a free mobile app and they should just use it because it will tell them what to do and they won't have to think about it.  I do voice that the Sheiko app is better but it isn't free and people balk at paying tiny sums of money for digital goods and I have better ways to spend my time so oh well."

powerlifting,3at7f1,theNightblade,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:53:05 2015 UTC,Most will advise 60-80% depending on what you want to get out of them.
powerlifting,3at7f1,BenchPolkov,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:04:41 2015 UTC,As i said before i dont go past 225 but i've never really test my max before. I've done 3 plates for 6 reps.
powerlifting,3at7f1,n3ver3nder88,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"on the Powercast last week, Matt Wenning was saying that he didn't like paused squats at all because it fucks up your regular form, which is exactly what I've experienced trying to do them as well.  You're likely not staying tight properly, which was my problem as well, the hesitation at the bottom is super awkward to me.  Maybe sub in some box squats instead and see how your back feels after those."
powerlifting,3at7f1,BenchPolkov,9,Tue Jun 23 11:57:22 2015 UTC,I disagree with literally everything you just said. The smart idea is to reduce the weight so that you can do the lift with the pause and not have your form go down the shitter.  And then box squat? They're even worse for people losing form on!
powerlifting,3at7f1,rdavis4559,2,Tue Jun 23 12:34:46 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought when I heard it, removing pause squats to sub in a lift with exactly the same problem. I do agree a lot of people compromise their tightness in the hole with pause squats though, so I can see Wenning's reasoning from that angle, just don't see box squats being a good option."
powerlifting,3at7f1,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:13:21 2015 UTC,Yeah you have to use pause squats intelligently. The same with any lift variation.
powerlifting,3at7f1,rdavis4559,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you keep your form spot on then you won't mess up your form.  In fact, for some people the focus on execution often leads to better form than unpaused squatting.  I don't know what the average for most people is but in terms of a 1RM my paused squat can stay looking nearly perfect at up to around 85-90% of my unpaused 1RM."
powerlifting,3at7f1,theNightblade,2,Tue Jun 23 14:19:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I generally drop at least 5% from my numbers for pauses. And if you've got a smaller squat I'd drop 10%.

powerlifting,3at7f1,2XLPowerlifting,2,Tue Jun 23 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"Pause squats can really highlight some weaknesses for that same reason. If you can't stay tight for the pause, then you're probably not bracing correctly; or if your hips shoot up to fast you aren't driving with your quads, and any other issues.   When I started doing pause squats and in weights over 90% for regular squats my chest would cave in and my hips would shoot up way to fast. I started doing paused high bar squats and they've really taught me how to drive with my quads out if the hole and keep my chest up through the whole lift."

That's why in my routine, i've thrown out ohp entirely in place of more benching, because 15/30 reps of bench per week most likely isn't enough for anyone to signficantly improve their bench, really. i got a lot of shit from r/weightroom once for not having the precious ohp in a program i wanted them to critique."
powerlifting,3as0wt,Lou__Tennant,6,Tue Jun 23 02:03:20 2015 UTC,OHP is a great lift and has lots of benefits....just no noticeable cross over for bench for me anyway after years. I have a great OHP and a shit bench compared to my other lifts. I put it after a 2nd bench session every week. Benching once a week for pure strength gains is like shoveling shit up hill and trying to stay clean.  Also pure bro science but bench needs volume for hypertrophy so you get the great benefits from a larger muscle cross section. Bench is the lift most effected by weight gain/ loss especially in the lower weight classes. You need to exploit pure muscle size and hypertrophy to have a good bench without going up weight classes. I see body builder guys my size squatting or deadlifting 1/2 what I can but repping 225 for 15 on the bench for multiple sets with a massive chest at like 170lbs.
powerlifting,3as0wt,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 23 02:17:19 2015 UTC,You need to exploit pure muscle size and hypertrophy to have a good bench without going up weight classes.    This is part of the reason that dumbbell assistance work is magic for building the comp bench.

powerlifting,3as0wt,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"Getting my bench up gets my OHP up, but it doesn't work as well the other way around. And it's like this for a lot of people; I remember John Phung saying the same thing. Makes a lot of sense, if you realise that the bench hits tha main movers of the ohp [other than the side delt, but since you start with the bar in front of you, side delts do less work than upper chest for most of the ROM], but less so the other way around.  I just try to do some at least medium intensity OHP a minimum of once every 2 weeks, so I don't forget how to OHP. And my OHP is still 70something% of my bench, which is way over average.  That said, it also has to do with how you bench. If you bench with a huge arch, front delt strength is less of factor, but if you're more of a flat bencher, it can be more important.  At the end of the day, there's really three things to consider:  a. do you care about the OHP?  b. do you get good carryover? Also, is the OHP a weak lift for you? Because a lot of people develop front delt strength just fine from flat pressing.  c. do you have rotator cuff issues that you need be careful with [assuming you're not among the people that get shoulder issues from OHP, because it's generally very RC friendly and there's a study that shows that it can even help with impingement long-term]? If you do, then you can usually OHP in place of an extra bench session, so you still get some pressing work done without taxing your joints.  Cause, even if you don't give a fuck about the OHP and get relatively little carryover, but your RD can't handle benching more than, say, twice a week, you might still benefit from an extra day of OHP, rather than just sticking to 2 days. It's a case of something over nothing. But then there's people that get NO issues whatsoever when they bench but ohp messes their shoulders up whenever they try it [that's mostly going to be people with internally rotated shoulders, but there's outliers too].  Overall, I do think people are generally better off doing at least some form of shoulder pressing every now and then, but how much and what kind is very individual. There's people with huge benches that rely on benching and shoulder raises for all their delt work and it certainly works for them."

I'm small as hell and almost no power rack gives me a good unrack position, so when I bench I elevated it using plates and that gets me closer for an easier unrack when I set it high."
powerlifting,3as0wt,Hail_Brodin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:46:12 2015 UTC,Not afraid of snapping up your lumbar or destroying your knees a la Brandon Lily?
powerlifting,3as0wt,Tyrwing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:41:32 2015 UTC,Not one bit. In a squat and deadlift you aren't trapped like you are on the bench.
powerlifting,3as0wt,TheDeathCard,2,Tue Jun 23 05:36:16 2015 UTC,"Its my weakest lift by far. That and I feel less comfortable doing upper body lifts. Its in the ""bro area"" of my gym and always crowded. I much prefer to lift in the little powerlifting corner which is tucked away from the rest of the gym and I rarely get bothered.  That and with my bench being weak, and my upper body lifts are pretty standard by gym standards, its a little drain on my confidence. I know its probably not a popular sentiment but its partially true for me. I feel like a bigger bad ass doing super heavy squats and deads, but upper body I'm just a fat guy who's a little stronger then your average bro."
powerlifting,3as0wt,Metallicadpa,2,Tue Jun 23 05:43:48 2015 UTC,Because most of your total comes from squatting and deadlifting. You can add 100 to each of those while only adding 30-40 to your bench in a year.
powerlifting,3as0wt,gideonng,3,Tue Jun 23 05:07:26 2015 UTC,plus squat and deads are highly correlated.

powerlifting,3as0wt,theNightblade,2,Tue Jun 23 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"I love training it, but honestly I'm starting to dislike the fact that it is probably the easiest of the three lifts to cheese. You see 160 pound guys taking a crazy big arch, barely keeping their ass in contact with the pad, and using an ultra wide grip to do 300 pound plus lifts.   I just don't think its in the spirit of powerlifting. Most people's squats look the same because of the depth requirement. I think there definitely needs to be some sort of RoM requirement or at the very least a lower maximum grip width, and this is coming from a guy who has naturally short arms. Hell, I would gladly end bench close grip in competition if it means eliminating some of the cheese surrounding the movement."

I feel stupid when all my work sets are under 2 plates meanwhile seemingly everyone at my gym can rep out 250+.  I like squatting and deadlifting better because I'm way stronger at them, and admittedly, I like that I can outlift mostly everyone at my gym on them."

powerlifting,3as0wt,sub-vitalsigns,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:18:56 2015 UTC,"Bench progress is generally less than sq and dl because people do less weight therefore it impacts your total less.  That being said, if you want to win competitions, you're obviously better off being good at all 3."

powerlifting,3as0wt,OakleyFitness,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Speaking strictly for myself, I have knuckle dragging arms, which make for a great deadlift, but a fucking abysmal bench. I train bench as hard as any of my other lifts, and I do everything I can to make it progress, but out of all the big lifts, it's the one that suffers the most if I'm having an off day. I can muscle through my programmed squats and deads, and even my OHP to a lesser extent, but my bench tends to be very inconsistent. I'll put up 295 for a smooth single only to struggle with 250 for a shaky triple the next week.   That's why I end every bench press session cursing that exercise."

powerlifting,3as0wt,skullknap,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:12:57 2015 UTC,I used to hate benching. I tore my pec on 335 and couldn't do the lift for 9 months. Managed to put 275 up for a smooth 5 reps 4 weeks ago and was pretty happy.   A new guy showed up at the gym that night and I watched him bench 560 for 8 or 9 reps. Spent the next hour talking lifts with him and getting pointers. This week I repped 315 for 4 sets of 3. So for some people maybe it is weak technique?
powerlifting,3as0wt,my_awesome_username,2,Tue Jun 23 07:59:26 2015 UTC,Definitely a technique thing. The bench is much harder to get down than squats or deadlifts I would say.

I like squatting more but some days my shitty knee doesn't want to move right or it takes forever for me to warm my hips up to even get under the bar.    I dislike deadlifting because I'm not efficient at it; yet at the same time I'm motivated to get better, one way or another."

It got pretty cramped, especially in the warmup area. I normally hate crowds and get frustrated being around so many people, but everyone there was absolutely awesome.   How many platforms/sessions was it?  Most states are moving towards several smaller meets inside a meet by adding platforms or splitting it up into sessions or days.  Kinda helps the warmup room crowding"
powerlifting,3as9ek,statasaurus,2,Tue Jun 23 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"2 platforms in one session. Lifting finished by 5 iirc.  From what I saw, the warmup area was well provided with 3-4 stations per platform but the overall space was partitioned in a way to make it feel relatively crowded."
powerlifting,3as9ek,Daveuall,2,Tue Jun 23 19:23:51 2015 UTC,That does sound pretty good... I remember before we mostly switched to the 2+ platform model having a 120 lifter meet on one platform. We were lifting at least from 9 to 9 just awful

powerlifting,3amc0z,OmnipotentStudent,2,Mon Jun 22 01:32:39 2015 UTC,I hit 405 at a dead stop on the pins. I was feeling ambitious. Took some straining but I got it. It wasn't a full squat but fuck it I'll take it to the damn bank.
powerlifting,3amc0z,PavidDagan,2,Sun Jun 21 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"I only tried something like Anderson squats once or twice in my life, felt too weird getting into position from the bottom end of the lift.  I did somewhat recently go in to do a single at 405 while ramping up to my top set, lost mental focus for whatever reason and accidentally paused that 405 at the bottom and still came out of it quite easily.  This was kind of cool because I accidentally upped my pause squat PR by 40lbs."
powerlifting,3amc0z,rdavis4559,3,Sun Jun 21 22:39:02 2015 UTC,Anderson squats are a bit uncomfortable sometimes (read: all the fucking time) but it definitely helps with power out of the hole. I widened my squat stance this past week and life seems to make so much more sense now so I'm gonna start incorporating more dead stop work to get as much as I can out of the hole.

powerlifting,3amc0z,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 21 22:52:55 2015 UTC,The first few seconds out of the hole is where I have to hope I can do it. Locking out is never my weak point. Likewise with bench getting it off my chest is the strainer. Past the midpoint and I got it easy.

Think of an Asian Jackson five member at the bench press (he's a no leg day kind of guy).  What's more annoying than all of that is his propensity to be very vocal about his relatively light bench (I guess he needs this to get amped up?) and the fact that rather than a sport bottle or thermos he insists upon carrying around an open glass full of water - the kind you'd use for the dinner table and actually made of glass."

He's doing bench press, so after my second set doing v-bar pushdowns, I turn my head and see him doing 155 lbs HALF REPS!(For those of you who dont know what half reps are because you are good people and bring the bar all the way to your chest, half reps are when you bring the bar from full extension to half way to your chest, which is doing little to nothing for you, except for making you think you can do more than what you can actually do)."

powerlifting,3amc0z,OmnipotentStudent,4,Sun Jun 21 21:57:29 2015 UTC,My only guess is too much momentum caused by using your lower back to pull yourself off of the chest support?  CSR is one of the five lat movements I've been doing weekly for a year and a half now and what I described is the only way my mind can imagine this happening.
powerlifting,3amc0z,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 21 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"Bingo!  Only came maybe half an inch off the support at most, and only the top half at that.  The arch in my upper back killed me."
powerlifting,3amc0z,Catechin,2,Sun Jun 21 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"Just be careful.  People do the same thing on barbell rows but they tend to force all of the weight with their biceps rather than straining the upper back musculature as you described, this is likely why you hurt your trap."

powerlifting,3amc0z,subliminalbrowser,2,Sun Jun 21 23:16:15 2015 UTC,Ah now it makes sense.  I don't decline bench either.  Normally I'd say safeties are the way to go but my gym has awesome benches with breaker bars which essentially means that the bench is racked on a lever type thing so that you can pull the bar forward and over you before lifting off rather than the standard way of doing it:  http://www.matrixfitness.com/product/view/mg-breaker-olympic-flat-bench  http://www.fitsupply.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x/09223bb708e3e82ab8c3b90b35809f38/m/x/mx13_photo_a678-orange_detail_bars-extended.jpg
powerlifting,3amc0z,rdavis4559,3,Sun Jun 21 23:19:54 2015 UTC,I was stuck using one of those while on a work trip. I fucking hated it! I couldn't use the bar to get tight properly because it just came forward. Ended up using a cage instead.

I push myself to where my butt is almost coming off of the edge of the front of the bench and then pull the breaker bar all the way forward until it can't move anymore and then pull myself into place using the opposing force of the lever, take a big breath and I'm good."

powerlifting,3amjry,powerliftinglife,2,Mon Jun 22 09:01:19 2015 UTC,And there's definate issues with his 5/3/1 review too though it does come out as largely positive. Saying you can't get strong for powerlifting by mainly only working between 70-85%... bullshit. And you can even throw in joker sets occasionally to get under heavier weight. And it doesn't have a systemised auto-regulation scale like RPE... nor did any other program before Mike T put RTS out for fucks sake.
powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,2,Mon Jun 22 09:06:23 2015 UTC,"I hadn't read that one but I have seen him say that you have to work in the 90-100% range before ... seems to me that that might encourage poor movement efficiency due to the form break down. But hey, I'm no expert... and I do actually like his work in general"
powerlifting,3amjry,powerliftinglife,3,Mon Jun 22 09:16:22 2015 UTC,"I like his spirit and I like his intent. I don't like his lack of experience. It becomes very apparent in some of his stuff. He's trying to be a guru of all things powerlifting but in doing so he spreads his minimal experience too thin and ends up relying on theory, much of which is just from Rippetoe who is far from being a powerlifting expert himself. And he is mildly obsessed with RPE's too even though lifters have being auto-regulating themselves for decades without it.  I argued with him once about his dismissiveness of mobility work in  relation to bench arching and he pretty much refused to consider anything I said and then got butthurt at my Aussieness (swearing is all part of a normal lively debate in Australia). He seemed to think that you were fine if you just arched through your lumbar spine and gave no focus to thoracic extension work but I can tell you from painful experience that doesn't end well, especially for thicker torso'd blokes.  That said I am still a member on his forum but only because I found a few other mates on there but its pretty dead as far as decent training discussion goes, too many youngsters with no experience and not enough old farts to tell them what's what."
powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,2,Mon Jun 22 10:10:38 2015 UTC,"The main problem I have with the obsession with RPE is that it almost always ends up being 9 RPE for main sets and 7-8 RPE for accessories, a.k.a leave 1 rep in the tank on main sets and 2-3 for accessories which is what most coaches have been saying for decades."

Interesting analysis of the bench arch, what mobility work do you do? Ironically, my arch is fairly strong without any particular effort but I seem to be stronger with a virtually flat back.  As far as the forum goes, by the time I got interested in powerlifting it was virtually abandoned. Although I have got a couple of useful pointers from there with regard to use of RPE (not that I've ever used it in my training but I found some of the downset methods confusing initially)"
powerlifting,3amjry,powerliftinglife,2,Mon Jun 22 10:41:34 2015 UTC,I get out a roller at the start of every session and often on non-training days and do this but of course in a much more extreme powerlifting way. My aim is to feel stretching in my ribcage. Also a better (but more painful) method is to do it over a barbell (either loaded with plates on the floor or in a bench or rack) and you can make it a more extreme stretch by holding something weighted in your hands behind you or getting someone to push down on your arms.
powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:00:10 2015 UTC,I do it over a barbell when I've got a few plates or more on there. Usually between deadlift sets.

powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,24,Mon Jun 22 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"Just some easy off the top of my head ideas...  1/ 5/3/1 full-body full-boring (I used something similar to this with most of my beginner lifters and it work well and for a long time. I've just been fiddling around the the Black Iron Beast 5/3/1 Calc and if you input these options it come closet to what I would consider a good beginner-intermediate program:    For rank novices with little to no training experience choose the 5/3/1 for Beginners template and run that for a little while. It is a little less of a shock to the system. If you have a few months of lifting in some form or another under your belt then choose the Full Body Full Boring template. Pick your preference for ""Main lifts programming"". I prefer Heavier because 5/3/1 percentages are pretty easy but if you want an easier start then choose Fresher. For ""Week Order"" choose 3/5/1.  For ""Work Sets Order"" choose Normal. For ""Joker Sets"" choose +5% and +10% For ""Down Sets"" choose First Set Last: Multiple sets and start with 3 sets of 5. This can be increased over time with your work capacity. For ""Full Body Full Boring Options"" choose option 1 (65%×5, 75%×5, 85%×5) or 3 (70%×3, 80%×3, 90%×3). In fact I'd recommend doing both, one on each day. Also as your work capacity increases I would recommend repeating the final sets for 3-5 sets total. Click ""Calculate"" and scroll down.   2/ SS/SL with bench and squat every training day (eg. 5x5, 6×3, 5×10)  Add bb'ing assistance at the end of each session too.  Actually I'm gonna expand on this post a bit so check back later."
powerlifting,3amjry,KrytieTV,2,Mon Jun 22 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"This is amazing! I've been lifting for 3 months now and just stepped of SS since I think it was not helping me progress towards powerlifting anymore.   Have looked into the normal 5/3/1, which seemed silly due to the frequency on the big lifts and OHP having its own day. Jonnie Candito's LP program seemed really great but I think I'm still enough of a beginner that I can get a bit more progress a bit faster than the program allows for. Was thinking of just doing the first two days of his program twice a week. (So no control days). But I think this would be a lot better, I like the reps and sets a lot more too.  One question, though, since I have a few months of training under my belt I choose Full Body, Full Boring. Should I add any assistance work in here? i.e. OHP and maybe some rows? I realize I'm barely a novice and my work capacity is not yet very high but it seems I'd really be leaving out my shoulders and upper back."
powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,6,Mon Jun 22 03:21:45 2015 UTC,"That post is still a work in progress actually but I did mean this for both options...   Add bb'ing assistance at the end of each session too.   Definitely do back every day, row/pullups/band pullaparts/etc as well as extra presses (ohp, db, etc) a couple of times a week and triceps, curls, hammie work, etc, at least once a week. I would usually pick 2-4 movements and do them as supersets when I ran 5/3/1 which was more time effficient for me."

Sorry if these seem like dumb questions, I've only had experience with a 5x5 program (ICF)"
powerlifting,3amjry,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 23 13:28:42 2015 UTC,Yep that's what it should say but some of the prescribed sets are warm-up sets so its not that scary.  However if you are still scared then start off on the beginner version and move up to Full Body Full Boring a little while later.

powerlifting,3amjry,Kouzmanovich,-7,Tue Jun 23 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"Take it with a grain of salt because I'm a novice myself (5 months of powerlifting focused training, yet to do a meet), but I think it would be best just to listen to your body and create your own program that suits you best. SL is great for getting people used to a routine and doing the major lifts, but other than that, it's pretty garbage. Change volume/frequency depending on how your body reacts to different types of training.   My upper body gains stalled as well when I was on a 'cookie cutter' program. Instead of continuing, I started benching EVERY day instead of just once or twice a week, mixing heavy doubles and 5x5 training and... results came pretty fast. Bench sky rocketed.

AFAIK the mantra for stalled and non-progressing OHP and BPs is to increase volume and frequency.  EDIT: Anecdotal evidence, personal experience - I'm benching three times a week, where two of those days I run OHP as an accessory with varying rep ranges. Both lifts have improved."
powerlifting,3amjry,JosephusBroz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:10:12 2015 UTC,Would you say then that doing a few extra chest exercises after a workout is sufficient? I mean my bench has always been my weakest so i'm really trying to improve. Then again with SL you only bench once/twice a week.
powerlifting,3amjry,po_ta-to,8,Sun Jun 21 18:21:03 2015 UTC,To start you could add more backoff sets after regular 5x5 benching. A 3x8 variant with lower percentages. Try and keep it relevant to the bench itself. Dumbbell benching can help as well. I'm basically regurgitating what I have read on here that people swore works. Im i'n no means an authority just passing on what appears to be good advice.  BEGIN u/BENCHPOLKOV SUMMON RITUAL

powerlifting,3amjry,acewolk,3,Sun Jun 21 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"I've personally helped someone and seen decent preliminary results by adding in another day with accessory work as a means to hit weak points without being too taxed from the 5x5 if it were done in the same day.  Ideally what I'd do is to increase frequency of the main lift or main assistance by adding in another day with the same standard, competition grip bench or bench with a different grip width while tapering the amount of sets on both the normal SL bench sessions and the extra day and then tailoring the reps for these sets to your goals.  Also, I've never seen anyone running SL or SS do this but in my opinion you should start pausing your reps at least some of the time."

powerlifting,3akqhq,Deathandblackmetal,23,Sun Jun 21 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"This may be an unpopular comment, but I'll go ahead:  It sounds like you're a beginner, and if you're anything like I was, I couldn't feel shit during movements. Whether it was because my muscles were so small, or for some other reason, I couldn't tell what I was doing.   If you are a beginner, my advice would be to simply think about pushing with your legs off the ground while trying to keep your shoulders raising at the same time. This way you'll stay in position.   If you're a bit more advanced, think of pushing with your quads (if those are weak your hips will rise without the shoulders) while simultaneously pulling your upper body back. Once you reach the knees, push the hips through.   Don't over think any of it. All you need to know are the biomechanics of the movement. The quads help off the floor. Try and 'press the world away' if it helps.   Really though, just try and stay in position.   I know I'm not that strong (~475 @ 175), but my deadlift form isn't bad considering my shitty proportions and I haven't thought too much about cues and such."

powerlifting,3akqhq,Itlan,5,Mon Jun 22 13:10:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was said in jest.  475 is great compared to a lot of the general population.  I do realize that what you personally experience is to a large extent defined by the environment and people you place yourself in.  For example, my best DL is 526 at 196 so 1) you've got me on pound for pound strength but the real point I was getting to is that 2) I've never seen anyone at my gym deadlift more than 470 and this includes a guy who can rep out a 315 bench for five while I can only get a single and if I were to guess, 90% of the people I do see deadlifting are doing so in a range between 115 to 375.  TL:DR - you're stronger than you give yourself credit for (475 at 175 is 2.74x BW), you're just probably like me wherein your basis for comparison are the titans you wish to become.  Anyway, back to OP's problem... Chad Wesley Smith and Ed Coan/Mark Bell both have semi-new deadlift articles/videos and I condensed tips from the two into something that was optimal for my mental cueing.  I don't need it often anymore but it is helpful sometimes to rehash old knowledge so as to reinforce it in your mind.  Here is what I put together (I did say I condensed it and to a great extent, let me know if any clarifications are needed):   Straight Back Externally rotate feet into ground/shoulder width stance Flex glutes & hams as you pull down into position Pack neck, flex triceps, arms taught/pull slack out of bar & engage lats  Draw big air into core (breathe into low back)./Chest up Initate-drive shoulders up & back as if driving them into bar during a squat.  Aggressive driving of feet into floor as if trying to jump up & backwards Pull up & back Drive in with hips/Don’t throw head back, keep neutral or tuck chin down as you lockout. Squeeze glutes to lockout at top"
powerlifting,3akqhq,rdavis4559,3,Sun Jun 21 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"You're on the dot with comparisons man.. I'm used to training with a friend who pulls heavy as I said above.   And dang that's a lot of cues!   I think at the most I think:   Big air then go down Head slightly up Push push push, cleared the knees, hips through and pull back, roll shoulders back"
powerlifting,3akqhq,OmnipotentStudent,3,Sun Jun 21 14:33:43 2015 UTC,"It is a lot of cues and was meant as sort of a near-comprehensive list.  I've been helping a guy who has only been powerlifting for about seven months now and just transitioned him onto a sort of customized stronglifts which among other things includes slightly more deadlift frequency - the SL deadlift frequency is so low that it had been very hard to work on his technique with more than a token demonstrative weight.  When I deadlift all I really think about is   Brace (includes core, lats, taught arms, all of that).  I'm good enough now that I can use that one work to subconsciously kick in multiple cues. Hinge back then push off (sort of like launch the weight and use that momentum) Tuck chin and push through with hips (the tuck chin along with the push through ends up giving me the same as your pull back/roll shoulders back)."

powerlifting,3akqhq,Mukuro-san,8,Sun Jun 21 21:37:22 2015 UTC,Don't over think it.  Squeeze the bar and leg press the floor. Then stand up.
powerlifting,3akqhq,failon,4,Sun Jun 21 07:20:58 2015 UTC,"Richard Hawthorne calls the deadlift a push movement, I agree with him partially - it IS push until the bar gets pretty close to the knees, assuming you don't round like crazy and stiff leg it up. I think Paul Carter says something similar.  That's why a lot of people like front squats for deadlift assistance."
powerlifting,3akqhq,ceejayess,3,Sun Jun 21 11:45:56 2015 UTC,"And Hawthorne can get away with it being a push movement entirely as his ROM is pretty small. By the time it comes to ""pull"" he's almost locked out anyway."
powerlifting,3akqhq,OmnipotentStudent,3,Sun Jun 21 13:27:23 2015 UTC,"Small tip. While this comes down to preference I found it helped a lot to do like a 70% brace of the core before even reaching for the bar. Then before the pull to finish the brace. Keeps me extremely tight. In addition, do not forget to tighten your lumbar and not just your abs."

We can't know his exact numbers without drugs.  His records stand even in feds where those drugs are not tested for.  Unless he was super responsive to the drugs, we can assume if the drugs never existed he would have been at a similar place relative to his competition.  Sure, if you wanna compare current drug tested lifters to Ed Coan you can make a comment about he was obviously on PEDs and your favorite dude might not be, so maybe he's at a similar level naturally, but that's a silly point.  We have the lists to make the comparison, and we know who stands where under what circumstances.  You wanna complain that Ed's 859 at 220 is probably not really natural and maybe someone else should have the drug tested world record, sure, no one cares.

Overall, decent article and summarizes things that most people who are intermediate+ on deadlifts well, but there's nothing too much that's new. Also, there's a bigger problem where he's taking cues from the heaviest lifts. If you look at actual training videos from most of these guys, their form is slightly different. There are form sacrifices to make a giant pull/PR so I'm not 100% sure if we should be taking cues from extremely heavy pulls for the most part. Maybe just my two cents.."
powerlifting,3ahtuj,truthlesshunter,7,Sat Jun 20 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the scaps being forward is like that in training or not. It reminds me how some of the best squatters seem to be ""hip dominant"" but it's actually just the heavy weight that tips them forward; when you look at training videos with <90% they are very upright in the hole."
powerlifting,3ahtuj,RedSpikeyThing,5,Sat Jun 20 13:38:06 2015 UTC,"Scaps should be forward in training too. It doesn't benefit you at all to retract them until lockout, when your chest is vertical and the load vector is as far out of the plane of scapular retraction as possible. You're just making things harder for yourself if your deadlift is limited by your rhomboids."

powerlifting,3ahtuj,tules,3,Sun Jun 21 08:42:14 2015 UTC,"Scapulae should be down and forward, to clarify. They can ride up and increase the moment arm of the weight on the hips as they go forward.

powerlifting,3aipkp,Arve,2,Sat Jun 20 16:21:19 2015 UTC,"There are weight classes in powerlifting. Depends on your federation. There are no standards in terms of weight you have to lift. You go in, you lift heavy shit(or not so heavy), and then you leave."
powerlifting,3aipkp,DrColossus1,2,Sat Jun 20 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"All powerlifting federations have weight classes - that allows people of the same appropriate mass to compete against each other. IPF and IPF-associated federations also calculates a Wilks coefficient for your lifts, so they can make a comparison between lifters in different weight classes. This may vary from federation to federation, but some competitions may have standards you need to meet in order to be able to compete.  Someone at 180 lbs with an 800 lbs total can't just turn up for the world championships and compete: You may need to qualify for that by working your way through the lower ranks, just like you can't get in a formula one car and try to beat Lewis Hamilton on your third day of driving a car.   In addition to that, there are coarser Strength standards that try to compare your performance across the population, that's divided in to sex, age and weight, so that you can reasonably say where you are.  Finally: If you're a beginning lifter, my piece of advice is to forget all that. Your most important opponent isn't the other people in the competition - it's yourself.  Find a local meet, figure out if said meet has a qualification standard or not, and sign on if it doesn't."

Don't forget that a lot of people who train 4 or 5 times a week actually train the big lifts or muscles less than in a 3 time per week approach.  Going from a 3 day full body program to a 5 day bro split is a good example.

powerlifting,3aev7n,brickonwheels,-4,Fri Jun 19 19:23:40 2015 UTC,Well I hit 405 for ten reps chalk and 405 for 7 with just straps can't hit 495 with the straps but I can with chalk I just started using both maybe I'm using them wrong
powerlifting,3aev7n,Pm_me_boooobs,6,Fri Jun 19 21:11:22 2015 UTC,"It's hard to use them wrong, really.  The main benefit is that you no longer have a weak link in the form of your grip.  A secondary benefit, in my opinion, is that you dont have to have a full grip on the bar, giving you +/- an inch more of rise before you feel the weight of the bar."

powerlifting,3ag1e1,Lobsterzilla,2,Sat Jun 20 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"Former westchester resident now in fl- good luck man. Im fortunate to be near some decent gyms now and out of curiosity I looked for powerlifting gyms in westchester and nyc a while back and was surprised there really werent many options. I feel like the biggest challenge to a specialty gym like this is how spread out westchester is. It's going to be difficult to get a dedicated group of powerlifters to support a PL only gym in a place like yorktown heights when they are probably pretty spread out over the county and it's not that quick to get anywhere. Realistically I'm guessing you're probably going to need at least 100 members plus coaching to get by and support a small strength gym, ideally more to make a comfortable profit (unless you charge crossfit prices). Can you get that many people interested in PL/strength to come to yorktown? barbell brigade has the advantage of being in LA.  Seems like white plains would be a lot more viable and around the area where you should be looking, and you should consider something like making it big/equipped enough where you could also rent it out to private personal trainers to train their clients which can help support the powerlifting side. I know quite a few specialty gyms do this including the pl gym I go to."
powerlifting,3ag1e1,theyoungscrivener,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"Great post, very much appreciated.  I would love to do white plains its actually where my house is and we could potentially get the rye, yonkers, rockland crowd in WP. Unfortunately leases are quite a bit more expensive vs going a bit up north, though maybe we could start with a smaller property to build a member base, we are definitely exploring this option.  I am in agreement 100 members seems to be about the magic number to break even if we didn't charge crossfit prices.  We were thinking somewhere in the $90-100/MO range.  A couple of the no frills ""fair priced"" properties we looked at and really liked are 60k-70k a year in lease costs alone, while we can cover costs, we definitely want to be profitable at some point!"

powerlifting,3afy0c,Aryjna,2,Fri Jun 19 20:40:26 2015 UTC,"I only started lifting fairly recently, and when I did, I found out that I had quite a few muscular imbalances. Slightly slanted hips, side to side, forward tipped pelvis, and uneven shoulders. I attribute all of this to sitting a lot, and being super right-side dominant... regardless, it causes some minor pains, and it is something I put a lot of thought and effort into. It may be worth looking into common unbalances and see if they are the culprit.   Also, it may help to focus your accessory work on single-sided exercises, (single/split leg squats, DB rows, etc) to see if you can identify some weaknesses and imbalances, and catch-up the other side. Also, note that it isn't uncommon to have imbalances that switch sides, for example: stronger right arm, shoulder, grip, and stronger left abs (from something like favoring the right hand and counter-bracing)  Anyhow, that's my 2 cents"
powerlifting,3afy0c,markers920,2,Fri Jun 19 23:02:54 2015 UTC,"I have already started using single arm exercises for the upper body. Dumbbell rows and i do most of the cable exercises like triceps extensions single arm as well, or dumbbell curls. Im not entirely sure this will help but we will see. I think i can detect some difference between the two sides in the dumbbell row but so far I don't see a way to fix it."
powerlifting,3afy0c,mazze01,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"Try and focus on pulling with muscles that you are supposed to. It is not an easy thing. I have a similar thing going.   My left glutes don't fire as easily and efficiently as the right after an injury I am coming back from. In my main lifts I focus on pushing or moving with the weaker side and let the stronger follow. With accessories I do a lot of bilateral movements. Walking lounges, focusing on correction. Even my warm ups target the weaknesses to make sure I am firing off correctly. Its one of those things that is great if you notice but silly if you don't treat and pay attention to.   It is likely that your dominant side is being the achy one as a result of ""over use"". Lifting is a good hobby, there is always something to get better at or improve.   Good luck!"
powerlifting,3afy0c,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:12:37 2015 UTC,"I found switching from mixed grip to hook grip on my deadlifts minimized imbalances in regards to strength/pains/tightness/etc. My left side (overhand) always seemed to be tight in the rear delts, hamstrings, etc. After hook grip, it all minimized."
powerlifting,3afy0c,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"When using mixed grip with my left hand facing out, my right hand is the dominant one, i saw recently that it probably causes some kind of discomfort or pain afterwards in the elbow, though i am not completely certain that that is the reason. I started having my right hand facing outward since a few days ago. Hook grip looks like it would be much better but im not sure i want to try it, if there is the chance of causing damage to the thumbs at some point."
powerlifting,3aevy1,limbo2007,13,Fri Jun 19 15:46:35 2015 UTC,"When it comes to technique, I hate the word ""perfect"".  Perfect is a conceptual ideal, and striving for perfection is impractical.  Instead of trying to be perfect, I try to make every rep better than the last one.  As long as there is an upward trajectory with my form, I am comfortable adding weight to the bar.  Unless you are very technically flawed, form will not severely break down until the weights get pretty heavy.  If you're doing rep work in the 70-85% range, it shouldn't be heavy enough to prevent you from improving your technique with every rep.  So I say continue to do your rep work as you normally would, just be conscious of your form and try get a little better with each repetition.  At the same time, in powerlifting, the goal is to hit a heavy weight for a single.  You have to be comfortable with a weight that feels heavy on your back or in your hands.  I think there's a lot of value in heavy singles in the 87-93% range when it comes to practicing good form with heavy weight.  You may have an ugly rep here or there, but ideally this will highlight areas that you are lacking.  If EVERY heavy single is ugly, then you should do more rep work in the 70-85% range and continue to practice and build your way up.  I've been running a pretty fun ""program"" (something I thought of while bored) for my upper body, while my knees and hips recover from some tendinitis issues.  I pick a single movement to prioritize (right now, it's OHP, for funsies).  I pick a weight that I can do 8-12 reps with as a starting point.  I will rep that weight out until I hit a grindy rep.  Then, I will work up to a heavy single (think: 5/3/1 joker sets).  Then I will rep out that original weight again.  I will add 5lbs the next session, and do it again.  Once I add so much weight that I can't hit a triple with it, I pick a new movement.  So, most of my reps come from those two rep-outs, with a few heavy singles on top.  When repping out a moderate weight, I will stop after a grinding rep.  There's no point in accumulating ugly reps with non-heavy weights.  But, when using a heavier weight, I know it won't be as pretty.  Grinding is OK, but if my form falls apart, I stop.  Handling heavy weights is important, and I want to practice the ability to keep my technique together against such loads.  But when I lose the battle, I know it's time to retreat.  So, for a very necessary TL;DR: Fugly-ass reps when doing rep work are no good, and a sign to stop the set.  But avoiding heavy weights altogether to make sure form is perfect at all times is not something I agree with.  Strive for improvement, not perfection.  Don't do heavy singles if your rep-work is ugly."

I'll make sure it's to competition standard, but I'm not afraid to grind it because I think that's almost a skill in itself, and learning how to grind when you need to is important.  Every other set I do throughout the week though I focus on building what I think of as ""quality volume."" Basically, lots of fairly easy sets (RPE 8 or so) with as close to perfect form as possible once I'm done my heavy work. I can get a ton of volume in like that without having to worry about injuries or fatiguing myself too much.  Is this the best way of doing it? I have no idea.

Monday, Tues and Wed are my heavy squat bench and deadlift days respectively, and then I'll do a lighter Friday squat and Saturday bench day, which will leave me feeling fresh again for the next week.

powerlifting,3aevy1,theNightblade,2,Sun Jun 21 12:15:47 2015 UTC,"For the competition lifts, a completed lift is a good lift.  I usually grind a few reps in the top set.  I don't consider it a problem, since you're likely going to grind out at least one attempt on the platform.    A failed rep is one that I would consider not passing quality for a meet (squatted high, didn't lock hips out in DL, not a good pause on bench)"
powerlifting,3aevy1,Daveuall,2,Fri Jun 19 17:32:00 2015 UTC,"Speed doesn't matter but reverting back to bad habits does for what I'd consider a good rep.

powerlifting,3aevy1,jthorntonj,2,Fri Jun 19 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a big proponent of the 80/20 rule. As long as my technique remains around 80% or better of what I'd consider ideal, I'm cool with it. When technique starts to degrade any more than that, I call it.

powerlifting,3aevy1,hsilman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"It depends on the focus of the lift/session.  I will say that the vast majority of reps that I train will be aimed at solid technique and decent bar speed.  However, I personally count every lift that I legitimately complete. Unless I'm specifically working on something like ""flat back deadlifting"" in which case any level of rounding means that's my last rep."
powerlifting,3aevy1,darkmagico,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it depends a little on the form breakdown.  You can't get stronger if you're doing good morning squats, but if your knees come in a little on a couple of reps of a heavy set, no big deal.  If your upper back rounds on the last couple of deadlift reps (or even the lower back just a little) that's okay too.  It's when you lose tension in your hammies that you're not going to get stronger.  If you lose tightness on bench that's okay, it's when your arms aren't even that you will be doing more harm than good.    Just my opinion.  I would also say that beginners should never grind in the first six months.  It's unnecessary and counter productive."

If I can get the weight up without any glaring or dangerous flaws in my form I feel comfortable with advancing. Does that mean some of my squats may be a little high? Sure. Some of my deadlifts you'll see my hips shoot up before my shoulders? Sure. Am I going to stop progression because of a few off reps? Nope.   As long as for the most part your technique is solid, I don't see an issue with having some leniency with yourself."

The German ones are existing stock in most cases, though I did find one website that basically just put a custom order through to Inzer on your behalf, which was pointless.

powerlifting,3aff1g,exatorp,5,Fri Jun 19 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"I’ve bought lots of stuff from StrengthShop before and I probably have an opinion on every point of the love/hate spectrum, given their QC. So my guess is there’s people who buy one thing and judge the entire experience on that. Which is fair.  I bought a Garage Gym setup from them and I got: a decent, if not exceptional bar; good bumper plates; iron plates with a few rusted ones in there; an okay-for-beginners-but-will-definitely-need-replacing squat rack; generic spring collars and a terrible excuse for a bench. That much variance in quality from a single order was a little crazy.  I’ve also bought an olympic dumbbell handle from them that was purchased new and turned up rusted; their prong belt that I actually really don’t mind (I’d say it was probably the best item I’ve got from them); ‘Odin’ knee sleeves which I really like; wrist wraps which are genuinely useless and their squat shoes which I think are okay for the price but would like to replace due to a few sizing/fit niggles.  So yeah, I have super mixed feelings about the stuff I’ve bought from there. I don’t think I’d ever go for anything ‘structural’ from them again (rack/cage/bench/etc.) as I don’t want the hassle of putting it all together, realising it sucks because they can’t QC their shit, disassembling it, sending it back and waiting for a refund/replacement. However, misc. equipment like belts/wraps/sleeves/micro-plates etc. is worth a shot and their customer service guys are super quick to respond.  Really, though, for serious equipment, I just don’t think they can hold up against the more renowned brands. The crazy variance in quality between already budget/cheap items is really holding them back, too.  As for why there’s such a huge difference in opinion on them, I’d pin that right on the quality control issues; so you can take the risk and luck-out and get something that is well-machined and stable or you can get a total piece of shit that wobbles and doesn’t fit together properly, it really is almost blind luck in my experience."

powerlifting,3aefc7,allrushmixxtape,25,Fri Jun 19 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"150 for 3 sessions a week is a fucking hell of a deal. A training session at gold's is 50+ a session. This is world class training, and if you can afford it you should definitely bite the bullet and do it. Are you competing equipped or raw? Make sure to make it clear to him which way you want to train since his bench presses are in gear. If he can bench 500 raw for 12 then either way you're in solid hands. I'm a coach myself and I still prefer to have others do my programming and having someone around to look me over makes a big difference between me having a certain bias to train the weak points I want to versus having someone else telling me what they think my weak areas are.   A good coach is going to push you as well as hold you back and keep you primed to peak at your meet. They are going to build your overall work capacity and keep you in optimal condition to perform your very best, instead of leaving it to the whims of yourself and what you think you can do that day.  I would say make the investment and commit to it for your November meet and watch your total skyrocket."

And then I do. That motivation is amazing.  We do a week of 10 rep max each cycle, and I would never be able to have the encouragement or motivation to squat or deadlift that heavy for so many reps if I didnt have someone who would shame me if Id rerack it."
powerlifting,3aefc7,mylord420,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the accountability factor and not wanting to let someone down makes a huge difference when it's time to push yourself. It's why having really good training partners can make such a big difference compared to training by yourself. At the same time, you as an athlete have to be coachable which is sometimes not the case and for those people having a coach probably isn't worth it all that much."

He kinda looked like a fat slob in the one picture I found of him too. Is one on one training worth it? Yes, if the coach can back up his claims. The guy you're looking to has no proof of his claims and looks like zero meets under his belt. I'd probably steer clear of him for coaching unless he can back up his claims."

powerlifting,3aefc7,my_awesome_username,8,Fri Jun 19 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"Lexen is $40 a month. Training with someone and being coached by someone is two different things though. I've never charged any of my guys to train under me. However, I've got a pretty packed gym on the nights we train now and I've had to turn people away that can't keep up. Now if we are talking about me coming in outside my own training schedule, then I'm definitely going to be expecting payment. Realistically the cost of me using lexen as a training facility for others, the cost of gas (it's 30 minutes each way), and the amount of time spent each week, I'd definitely have to charge more than $150 a month. That being said I've been able to get great results from those directly under me."

You will have probably gained some new helpful information at the very least.

Are you looking for coaching on your technique?  Don't forget that just because someone is strong doesn't mean they are a good coach.

What personally worked for me, was following the 5/3/1 template followed by back off sets and adding additional reps.  For example:   Set 1: 5x65% Set 2: 5x75% Set 3: 5x85% Backoff Set 1: 6@75% Backoff Set 2: 7 @ 65% Backoff Set 3: 8+@65%   Followed by 5x10 @ 50-60% (BBB style)  Has taken my bench from 100kg 3rm and 110kg 1rm to a 110 3rm and 120kg  1rm over the past 4 months.  Also a lot more upper back work, pendlay rows (heavy 5x5), kroc rows (lighter 5x15), facepulls, and some accessory work at the end of the workout:   4x12 dumbbell incline bench 5x10 tricep extensions 4x8 close grip bench   Being my favorites.  The accessory work certainly helped, but I found just increasing the volume of bench even though at lighter percentages worked wonders for me."
powerlifting,3aa8bb,RedSpikeyThing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:42:44 2015 UTC,"I have had an issue for a long while. It is that during the squat, the bar will always drift about 4 inches forward to the center of gravity. Now, I can really focus on sitting back, and have a straight bar path, but this makes me about 40lb weaker (having the bar drift 4 inches forward is my strongest position). Should I just go with it, even though it is mechanically inefficient? (I'm not a beginner, I have 464lb squat at 181, so this isn't something I can just fix with a few weeks of form work)."

Part of my pain management and treatment is to find movements I can do without pain, without bringing the sciatica back, and that would offer a progression back into regular squatting.  So far, the best option I've found are hip belt squats.  High box squats have had mixed pain results.  The shitty leg press at my shitty gym hurts.

I've been using the adductor machine post workout recently to try and strengthen my adductors have no idea if this is useful at all.

powerlifting,3aa8bb,Danneborger,3,Thu Jun 18 15:38:31 2015 UTC,Or banded work! I found that helped me a lot. Go light maybe 60-70% and just bust that bad boy up with continued acceleration even thought its heavy at the top.

powerlifting,3aa8bb,ceejayess,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Floor press would probably still work in your situation (assuming you're raw), since you have to accelerate the bar enough to push it past that sticking point anyway."

If you're getting stuck 3-4 inches off the chest, good options might be things like 1-2 board press, 2"" spoto press, that kind of stuff.  Maybe even slingshot work if you have one.

powerlifting,3aa8bb,JI22,2,Sat Jun 20 11:54:46 2015 UTC,"Both are fine, but it's better to fix your low bar if you're interested in powerlifting.  Focus on pushing your traps into the bar as hard as you possibly can as you come out of the hole.  As you pass your sticking point and slow down, try to push the hips through.

powerlifting,3aa8bb,Danneborger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:03 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks! I will go watch that.
powerlifting,3aa8bb,Fudgms,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"What he said.  For me, pushing my traps is a better cue than just trying to stay upright.  Everyone responds differently to different cues, so find what works for you.  Definitely check Ed Coan and ST's squat video out as mentioned.  Super informative.  For staying tight, I like Duffin's cue to ""push your obliques out.""  I also like ""be the tree trunk."""
powerlifting,3aa8bb,Danneborger,3,Thu Jun 18 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"I would suggest submitting a form check with a video to see if it's a form break down or your proportions (see Layne Norton's squat) or weak quads. I also have my low bar squats turn into good mornings and I'm fairly certain it's weak quads with an over powering posterior chain. I started to fix this by throwing in some high bar squats here or there and practicing my front squat technique. Recently I started running the GZCL method and have stopped low bar squatting except for working up to a single at like 85% here or there. It's only been about 6 weeks of high bar as my main movement with front squats as tier 2 work once a week and leg press here or there but it seems like it has helped greatly so far. I will know for sure at my meet in a month from now.   It seems like high bar has an amazing great carry over to low bar, especially if your hips are already your strength so I suggest if it seems like weak quads are your problem I suggest trying them and also to try to see if you can work on form at light weight for front squats so you can start doing those at a decent weight once you are done with SL. But again my first suggestion is a form check."
powerlifting,3aa8bb,Fudgms,3,Thu Jun 18 21:04:07 2015 UTC,I'll add to this because my squat mornings were a massive issue. Now it's not so much because quad work has become a main staple. Three times a week. I hammer my posterior chain which left those muscles much stronger than my quads. Leg extensions. Heavy ass leg extensions three times a week and unilateral leg presses twice a week. If I could high bar squat I would but my right knee shin screams fucking murder whenever I do.
powerlifting,3aa8bb,Danneborger,2,Thu Jun 18 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem. For myself, I think it may have been due to the fact that low bar squats are a perfect medium between knee and hip flexion (at least for myself) and deadlifts are hip dominant, thus it was inevitable that I would (relatively) over develop my posterior chain since my volume was directed towards hip movements."
powerlifting,3aa8bb,BenchPolkov,2,Fri Jun 19 01:44:20 2015 UTC,I recently had this issue flare up.

Supplement the wider grip with some chest work with dumbbells or barbell incline benching. Switching from a relatively close grip to max width helped me a lot, as I really learned to use my pecs when I bench.  Work on thoracic mobility with a foamroller so you can arch higher. Work on hypertrophy, especially incline benching and overhead pressing has helped me. If all else fails, gain weight and just keep pushing with progressive overload."

powerlifting,3aa8bb,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"Well depending on your bench frequency, working up to a top set of around 3-8 reps and then having 2-3 back-off sets with reps a bit higher is a safe way to do it. That's what I do, that simple method brought my bench to 350 touch and go. With your bodyweight I'm guessing you're not too lean and not too jacked for your weight, so just working on hypertrophy with BB movements aside from benching should work."

Personally, I have the reactive and my coach has the original and there is a pretty big difference between the two. The original is a lot stiffer and gives more pop off the chest where the reactive makes you work a little harder because it isn't as strong. The full boar is technically the same strength as the original but the sleeves are cut at an angle so it's a bit more comfortable of a fit and you can wear it up higher on your arms like a bench shirt. The only reason it's a little ""stronger"" is because since the sleeves are angled it kicks in sooner and let's you handle more weight. The maddog is a double ply slingshot and is mainly reserved for freak beasts who bench a hell of a lot more than I probably ever will.

I want to run smolov to peak my weakest lift for a meet on Oct 3rd and want to know what to do since I am not supposed to deadlift during this time. I have been in contact with Eric Spoto and I will be running his PGS program for bench only alongside the Smolov program that focuses on squat only (which may or may not be a bad idea) but I was wondering would my deadlift suffer as a result of not training for 13 weeks? I am fairly young so if need be I can work deadlifts in once a week somewhere but just want to make sure I do this right and have the correct advice from the knowledgeable people of /r/powerlifting. I am 18 years old with 455 lb/330 lb/510lb (raw w/ wraps) 198 lb class if that matters for anything. I figured that the 1RM is without wraps and the training is also without wraps. Is that true?

If they had a Smolov type program that incorporated bench and deadlifting where I could train 6 days a week and advance on all lifts that would be great but I can't find one.
powerlifting,3aa8bb,Danneborger,2,Thu Jun 18 19:59:11 2015 UTC,From what i remember its generally encouraged that you dont train deadlift at the same time because they engage a lot of the same muscles and it will overwork them. And there isnt a smolov program for all three smolov was made for squatting and people used the first mesocycle to help their bench

powerlifting,3aa8bb,coffeecupschooner,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:40:01 2015 UTC,You can put those foam yoga mats under your hex plates. It stops them from rolling around. Also reset after each rep that does move.  No need to change your programming. I work out at 24 and don't understand the complaints.
powerlifting,3aa8bb,chacarronx,2,Thu Jun 18 17:26:12 2015 UTC,Any bench programming advice for switching from a standard grip to a wider grip with more arch in order to get a higher total?
powerlifting,3aa8bb,DrColossus1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"Well you, obviously, need to take some time to adjust to the new form. Some people have shoulder issues with wide grip benching. A good idea is to incorporate it after your (current) regular grip benching. A few sets of about 5 reps at around 60% is fine to begin with. A new technique requires new coordination and neural patterns. Over time you will strengthen your pecs more with the wider grip and improve your result to more than your closer grip result."

A 5'11 man's body can produce enough anabolic/androgenic hormones to maintain about 185lbs of lean mass max; chances are, naturally, you'll never have that anyway (although I may not either, close as I am).   28% @ 297 means 213lbs of lean mass. 40% @ 97 means 178lbs of lean mass (which is probably still high but at least it's not unreasonable or unattainable).

powerlifting,3aa8bb,BodyRiddle,4,Thu Jun 18 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"Look up FFMI (fat free mass index). It essentially says that, neglecting any amount of fat on a human body, your lean body mass has a certain limit based on your height that nobody can naturally overcome. Essentially, a man cannot produce enough testosterone to grow into or maintain more than about 185-190lbs of fat-free mass; this corresponds to a FFMI of about 25, which is the accepted natural lifetime limit of a person with great genetics, training, and diet.  Going beyond that means A) fat % was incorrectly estimated and thus FFMI is actually lower B) they aren't a natural athlete C) they are the .0001% who can go beyond 5 (it's been seen up to 27ish for less than 5 indivduals ever), and that is only after years of perfect diet/training."

I don't feel particularly hungry and my lifts haven't suffered as much as I thought they would for how much weight I've lost. I think for the fatter dudes like us most of the rules of cutting don't have to apply.   I'm keeping a rough calorie count in my head that usually ends up around 2200 or less barring the occassional binge drinking or family shoving food down my gullet. I know from my bulk that I can make a lot of progress so I'm willing to postpone powerlifting for a bit to hopefully get not fat.   I started at 205x2 OHP, 285 Bench, 405x4 squat, and 495 deadlift. I haven't truly maxed in a while but in the past couple weeks I've done a 185 OHP, 295 bench, and a 455 deadlift. I'm doing front squat as my main movement for the summer for fun and to bring up my quads so I'm not sure exactly how much I've lost there but I can front squat somewhere between 300-315.   Tl;Dr Your goals are your goals and if you want to lose weight fast, it's easier than you'd think if you're willing to put off strength for a little while.   Edit: And I see you're just starting to focus on lifting heavy things. I started a little over a year ago and got pretty strong first and am just starting to focus on my diet recently. IMO that was a very bad decision and I would suggest getting to a relatively normal weight first so you don't lose hope, like I did, when people can't see how much effort you put into your training."

Do the wrist curls with your arm at a 45 degree angle hanging against something like an incline bench/preacher bench.

I don't have tennis elbow (ie regular elbow tendonitis), this is directly caused by heavy doubles on bench.

powerlifting,3aa8bb,mizdachubz,2,Thu Jun 18 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"Wrap your wrists so hard that they can't bend. Especially for squats if you use a thumb over grip, tightly wrapped wrists should help a lot, might even help with elbow pain too. Obviously for pressing as well [moreso overhead than bench in my experience], but that's pretty straightforward. Cut out stuff like pushdowns [only exercise that ever hurts my elbows, can even cause actual pressing to ache if I do it too often], as it's known to cause elbow tendonitis.  If that doesn't work, just take it easy for a bit. You're better off dealing with this before you get actual tendonitis that lasts for a long time. My friend had this exact same issue, none of that stuff worked for him and it kept getting worse until he listened to me and took it easy for a couple of weeks; that was 3 weeks ago and his elbows are fine."

When I did do sumo lifts, it felt great. I felt like I could eventually pull more than I do with conventional if I kept training sumo. But now, my hips feel so destroyed, that its even hard for me to setup for bench and use my hips/legs for leg drive. Was I just too aggressive with training sumo that one day?

It would be more useful to see the relationship of stance to performance for each weight class, but I'm not sure    That is true, but because individuals are likely to choose the stance that they perform best in a competition setting, you have community voting, (based on empirical evidence) here for which stance works best (from individual's opinions) at the various classes.

powerlifting,3a7ck6,dwightshoulders,7,Wed Jun 17 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't conclude that this shows which stance works best, just that a majority in the lower weight classes think sumo works best for them.

powerlifting,3a7ck6,dwightshoulders,4,Wed Jun 17 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"This is what you should be looking at when it comes to these weight classes:   59kg men - These are tiny men.  By all standards, they're little.  They likely have very little arms and while their short legs would indicate conventional being super easy, their proportionally shorter arms mean they have to open their legs up close the distance to the bar.   From there, you see this becomes less of an issue, increasingly, until the 105kg class, where it's even(ish).  This is because at 105kg you have more people with varied heights and proportions, until such time as you hit 120 and 120+ classes, where the sheer size lends ot pulling close and strong, unless individual proportions leave you more suited to pull sumo.    Those in the 120kg+ class are pulling conventional because in order to amke it to that level, i'ts not a situation of A leading to B, it's A because of B.  They were already going to be massive, they were already going to be strong, they were already going to have the proportions to pull conventional, so they used them.  Women are a different situation and you see more varied biomechanics in women which is why you see all those varied sumo/conventional numbers.   You could probably run these numbers at any decent high level meet and see the same phenomena...  at the very least it'd be interesting."

powerlifting,3a7ck6,Onsager,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"The deadlift starts from an arbitrary 9"" position.  Typically (generally) the shorter you are or the shorter your legs are, you are going to start closer to the bar.  The closer to the bar you start, the better your starting position you can be, and hte less range of motion you will likely have.  The reality however, is a guy that weighs 120lbs, is likely SHORT.  LIke, really short.  A really short guy probably has really short arms, and this is why just being closer to the bar might not be enough, they may have to fix that gap even further by using sumo to alleviate the issues due to their short arms.  Now, as you get taller, you are more likely going to have a 'normal build'.  Decent height, normal legnth legs/femurs, long(er) arms.    These dimensions lend themselves to to conventional.  Also, i'ts less about ""conventional is better when you're tall"" and more about ""what kind of build do the strongest people end up with"".    The strongest deadlifts are usually tall gorillas and are TYPICALLY one of hte following builds   LONG arms, short torso, medium built legs (Benedikt Magnusson) LONG arms, medium/long torso, short legs (George Lehman, Konstantinovs) LONG arms, medium torso, medium legs (Eddie Hall, Andy Bolton)   You do not typically see monsters pulling conventional with short arms and long legs.  And the more genetically predisposed you are to being a monster, you will also likely have one of the three aforementioned builds."

Like.. what part of you should be close to the bar? Your center of gravity? Or where your hands are at lockout?  So basically you are saying that being tall doesn't mean anything in and of itself. Its the length of your limbs and torso that defines what will be your optimal deadlift style. If you are tall with long legs, you simply will not be able to compete with someone who is the same height, but has shorter legs (hypothetically).  Another follow up question would be, why can't a tall person with long legs compensate by pulling sumo (and still compete with the big dogs)?"

However, varying limb lengths will end up defining how well you do at any of these lifts.   Another follow up question would be, why can't a tall person with long legs compensate by pulling sumo (and still compete with the big dogs)?   You don't typically see ""tall people"" with long legs and shorter arms.  Big people are typically big everywhere.  Also, you don't typically see 6'0 monsters with really short torsos, that's why  you have less Benni's and more Boltons/Halls.  In my personal opinion, I think if you have the proportions to pull conventional OR sumo, but have a huge belly, you're going to get more out of a conventional cause the gut changes your mechanics in the hole of a squat or start of a pull."

Because I still don't think I am picking up what you are putting down. I'm just trying to learn at this point.   It's reasonable to believe that two peoples with identical proportions, one being 5'0"" and one being 6'0"", the 6'0"" would have to put in more work to be able to deadlift from the same 9 inch height.   Agreed. This is kind of what I was getting at. Clearly, the 6'0'' dude has to move the bar further. Wouldn't pulling sumo shorten that distance and work? Sticking your feet out wide essentially makes you shorter.   You don't typically see ""tall people"" with long legs and shorter arms.   I was more talking about tall people with long legs, normal torsos and normal arm length. It seems short arms is a disadvantage in either style of pulling, as it automatically means you have to move the bar further than someone with longer arms.  I am trying to figure out why the biggest dudes pull conventional, if the bigger you are, the further away from the bar you are. The following bullets are why I am confused:   Taller dudes have longer legs than their shorter competitors, regardless of proportions to the rest of their body. This means they will be farther away from the bar. Pulling sumo shortens the distance the bar must move between the starting position and lock out. This would seem to benefit taller competitors, who would otherwise have to pull the bar all the way to a standing position if doing conventional.   Maybe what I am getting at here, is that in all cases and in all body types, pulling sumo will always require less work to be done to get to lockout. By less work, I mean the bar has to travel less distance to get to lock out.  I have to assume that this is not the case - otherwise everyone would pull sumo! But I am hoping you can explain to me why this is not the case. And I am sure you feel like you have already explained this to me lol. So for that I apologize."

This means they will be farther away from the bar.   But they typically have more common builds and you don't routinely see a lot of taller people built like Richard Hawthorne or Lamar Gant.  Just having ""longer legs"" doesn't mean their torsos and arms don't give them a position to pull conventional well.    Also, sumo doesn't work chain in the same way that conventional does and can be very taxing on your hips.  Sometimes it may just be a situation of choosing to pull conventional over sumo as many top level squatters use a wider, hip heavy stance.  Considering squatting is where you will likely get the most weight, unless you're a deadlift specialist (Bolton, Konstaninovs, Kroc, Benni, et al) you're probably going to be more inclined ot hit that 950lb squat over that 800b pull.   Pulling sumo shortens the distance the bar must move between the starting position and lock out. This would seem to benefit taller competitors, who would otherwise have to pull the bar all the way to a standing position if doing conventional.   On paper, sure.  But it doesn't seem to work that way in practice due ot the number of high level competitors, especially taller ones, that pull.    I can't personally off the top of my head name more than a single (Mark Bell) deadlifter that's 6'0"" or taller that pulls sumo."

They are all trying to win and they all will pull with the style that they perform best with.  Obviously, the information you are asking for would help paint a more detailed picture.

powerlifting,3a7ck6,DreamHouseJohn,9,Thu Jun 18 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"Since there is a lot of convoluted information throughout this discussion I figured I'd just try to correlate the main relevance of the information from a collection of posts...  Firstly, /u/mylord420 points out that:    at top levels, weight classes are pretty much height classes in disguise.    This is because the larger your bone structure the more room you have to accumulate mass. Mass wins. There are few ""skinny"" elite lifters.  ...but as /u/HaughtPockets said:   If your point is correct that weight classes = height classes, then this graph would mean that shorter lifters pull sumo and taller lifters pull conventional. I don't really think that's accurate, as short guys can have optimal leverages for conventional and tall guys for sumo.   ...However /u/independence1991 clarifies that in general:   more weight->more height->longer arms->conventional favored   ... /u/Jag28 questions:   Isn't it a matter of longer arms in proportion to the rest of the body rather than just absolute length? Assuming the proportions between a taller and shorter lifter are the same, why does stance preference differ?   ...but /u/independence1991 further clarifies by saying: (paraphrased)   you're right, but if you're tall, you usually have a greater arm:torso ratio as well. Usually tall people are taller is because they have longer legs and therefore longer arms, the torso length doesn't change that much in comparison to extremities.   Edit: and also relevant is, as mentioned by /u/dirtyid:   limitations of equipment dimensions. The bar height and width doesn't scale with lifter. The shorter lifter with smaller limbs simply maybe able to milk better leverages.   Does that make sense? Torso, leg and arm length all come into the equation but torso lengths have generally less variance between between taller and shorter lifters as it is leg length that often creates the extra height. Of course between the tallest (heaviest) and shortest (lightest) lifters there will likely be considerable torso difference but it there will be less relative difference in the middle heights (weights). However, as said, this is a generalisation and there will always be outliers in body ratios, and others who are just stronger at a certain stance because they have trained so much for it or cannot do the other stance because of injury.  And if this link works for you (its no longer opening for me though it did earlier today) then you can see some suggestion about how you might choose what stance you are more suited too.   And for women its a whole other argument!"
powerlifting,3a7ck6,flannel_smoothie,2,Thu Jun 18 10:13:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this makes way more sense.   cannot do the other stance because of injury.   Also, this.  I keep trying to force myself to learn conventional and it just doesn't work. Like, I can rip 405x7 sumo but can barely triple 365 conventional despite only training sumo ~9 of 36 months.  Probably just should go back to that and fix my mobility"

powerlifting,3a7ck6,flannel_smoothie,2,Thu Jun 18 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"Typically, as your get taller, your legs get longer (disadvantage) and your arms get longer (advantage). They seem to balance out, no?  I asked this question elsewhere, but perhaps you can give me a more clear answer...  Pulling sumo shortens the distance the bar must move between the starting position and lock out. By spreading your legs out, you effectively make yourself shorter. Shorter is better, regardless of original height. This would seem to benefit all competitors, regardless of height, who would otherwise have to pull the bar further to reach lockout (if they were pulling conventional)  It seems that regardless of variables; length of legs, torso and arms, we see that in all cases and in all body types, pulling sumo will always require less work to be done to get to lockout. By less work, I mean the bar has to travel less distance to get to lock out - as opposed to conventional.  While it makes sense on paper, we can see that in reality, this is not the case - otherwise everyone would pull sumo. SO, the question is why? What is the variable I am not accounting for? Why are tall people pulling conventional? Why is anyone pulling conventional, when pulling sumo reduces the necessary work performed?"
powerlifting,3a7ck6,wadded,17,Fri Jun 19 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/0cRCJAu.png Very rough sketch on how existing equipment dimensions affect ROM between 5ft and 6.5ft lifters of equal proportions. Smaller lifters basically have better leverage opportunities and potential to reduce ROM given fixed equipment. Just the arbitrary starting height provides relative advantage to the shorter lifter. The taller lifter is essentially pulling from a 2.5 inch deficit. Moving to max collar to collar sumo stance, the 5ft lifter reduces ROM by 1/2, while taller lifter reduces ROM by 1/10."

powerlifting,3a7ck6,mylord420,2,Wed Jun 17 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is how it works, as short and tall people can be of all different proportions. The main difference I see is to do with relative bar height off the ground, since the bar height does not change lifter to lifter and also length shorter lifters are essentially closer to a sumo block pull for the tall lifters. From what I have seen with sumo a deficit makes it much harder and a block makes it much easier, where as conventional is not so. So shorter lifters will need less flexibility to get down to the bar and the ROM they do have in sumo will be easier as the bar is starting further up their shin.   Well at least that is my hypothesis, it may also be to do with flexibility decreasing as weight classes go up but I don't really see any reason why that would be the case."
powerlifting,3a7ck6,HaughtPockets,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"well it obviously shows via the graph that more shorter elite level lifters are better sumo pullers than conventional. That is what this is displaying. You don't get to the top of the world level without trying both styles out, using both styles in training (one as accessory). They're prob proficient in both.  SO if substantially higher % of guys in the under 105KG class pull sumo, it means a higher than 50% of shorter guys likely would be stronger at pulling sumo, technical proficiency being equal."

powerlifting,3a7ck6,Catechin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Where do you usually grip? As narrow as possible or wider out?  I really want to start practicing sumo but I feel so insanely weak when I try. I also don't feel as much quad drive in sumo as I do in conventional. My quads are by far my strongest muscle group so I like to get that benefit when doing conventional. I'll even sometimes lift in adipowers for extra quad drive. I feel like the quad drive makes up for the slight deficit. Maybe it's just all psychological though.
powerlifting,3a7ck6,Catechin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"My ring or pinky finger are on the narrow grip so my hand is on the smooth part of the bar.   If that makes sense.   I don't really feel too much quad drive. My glutes/hammies and adductors are what i feel for most of the pull until i lock my knees out (because, you know that's what quads are supposed to do).   I use wrestling shoes to pull/squat if that matters.   E: i guess my grip is a tad narrower than shoulder width. I use over/under grip for heavier weights. Double over until ~400lbs or so."

I've seen some sumo pullers go very wide almost as wide as their legs which makes sense if you have longer arms to change ROM.   That's what's hard about sumo I feel it mostly in the posterior chain which is still strong but not nearly as strong as my quad drive.   I think the main issue is just not feeling comfortable in a sumo position. I may have to give it a go since it seems like the 165ers seem to prefer it and I'm sure there's a good reason for it.
powerlifting,3a7ck6,JohnTesh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:07:36 2015 UTC,I found that doing snatches before sumos loosen my hips and give me a good range of motion.  And it gets my body ready to have explosive hips.   Maybe that could work for you? Who knows.
powerlifting,3a7ck6,Danneborger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:03:13 2015 UTC,If I wasn't TERRIBLE at snatching it probably would. I'll just have to work on my flexibility and foam roll more often and give it a go!

His stance worked for him because it let him use his back and where he was strong.  Thinking about that, I'm surprised by how no one really seems to pull semi-sumo anymore.  It's either conventional or as close to the plates as the lifter can get."
powerlifting,3a7ck6,BenchPolkov,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:22:58 2015 UTC,"I find anyone using it usually has short legs/long torso, and is weakest off the floor.   Hence why I've started working on it. :D  It is quite weird, though.  It feels less like a pull and more like you're just pushing the bar up.    I don't think Mike does anymore.  In the Coan series he was pretty close to the plates, although I'm thinking I remember what you're talking about now."

As a short man (5' 6""), I actually have long torso and arms meaning my proportions work for either sumo or conventional. However, I have short legs and tend to be quad dominant (making me pretty good at squatting). For competition, it may be that sumo is best. But also being an old fart and unlikely to compete at an elite level, it may be better for me to pull conventional to hit my posterior chain, balancing out my squat."

powerlifting,3a8chx,Deadliftyofeelz,3,Thu Jun 18 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"Is the cause of that due to an injury to your elbow? You have a ridiculous bench already, but it might benefit you to work on increasing flexibility of your right arm by loosening the soft tissue in your elbow. I believe slow stretches and messages everyday can aid in increasing your ROM. I say it might help because OHP aids the bench primarily by strengthening the triceps aka the lock out portion of the movement. If you feel like your right arm is preventing you from fully engaging the tris, then it's probably an issue for your bench. Still, a lot more factors come into play, just my two cents."
powerlifting,3a8chx,Exboss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"It's an injury, sadly. Got hit in the elbow with a fastball when I used to play and it caused a small bone chip to be lodged in where the bone (apparently) extends into, or whatever it is.   I know you're right, even my triceps are weaker than I'd like them to be. Then again I never work them directly. Would you suggest some tricep work and stretching as a way to help out?  And thank you for the kind complement!"

powerlifting,3a8chx,moldeh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear. Injuries suck, but seems like you've come a long way in relation to your pressing. Now, I suggest warming up the elbow by slowly extending your arm 90% of full ROM  (135) then slowly bending back after a few seconds of pause, few times everyday while focusing on extending more each day is a start. Another stretch is getting a towel on the floor and resting your elbow on top to get a light stretch of the bis (should be laying down). The key to getting back ROM  is very, very slow stretches to prevent further damage and get the soft tissue to loosen up. Can't go wrong with stretches unless you feel a lot of discomfort doing them, so get creative lol. Also, have you tried floor presses and close grip bench (probably with that bench, right)? If you have no pain benching, they target the tris pretty well mayne."
powerlifting,3a8chx,YetiDick,0,Thu Jun 18 02:13:01 2015 UTC,"A lot of great advice, my brevity isn't an indication of my appreciation, so thank you! I have not tried it but both sound like a fun way to do tris. I'll check into this for sure!"
powerlifting,3a8chx,DankestLlama,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:16:04 2015 UTC,Ever thought about getting surgery? I'd imagine that benching with one arm locking out at 135 degrees isn't too helpful. I could see you breaking 400+lb easily with a healthy elbow. Too expensive / recovery too long?
powerlifting,3a7ooq,stevewestbelfast,25,Wed Jun 17 21:42:36 2015 UTC,You're bad at deadlifts so you want to stop deadlifting? Yeah that makes sense...  Maybe try MORE DEADLIFTING?
powerlifting,3a7ooq,BenchPolkov,3,Thu Jun 18 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"From that passage   My question is, can I stop deadlifting for a good while and only focus on technique.    I think OP meant to ask whether it made sense to only practice light deadlift focusing on technique while counting on the squat to build his strength."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,needlzor,4,Thu Jun 18 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I still don't think that's a great idea either. Maybe he needs to wind his weights back a bit to practice technique but I don't think doing just ""light"" deadlifts will be as beneficial as doing more deadlift practice with a weight that he can maintain some decent form with. Squats help build part of the deadlift but it hardly builds all of it."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,BenchPolkov,11,Thu Jun 18 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"It can't possibly be a lack of hamstring strength, because the hamstrings pull the pelvis down, not up. Hamstring flexibility might be an issue.  You're not going to get better at deadlifting by not doing it, but you might benefit from reducing the load for a while and trying to get your technique nailed down. And if your back is weak, do more back work."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,Brightlinger,-3,Wed Jun 17 21:50:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm I've never thought of it like that. I've always looked at my hamstrings and thought that they looked big, therefore they must not be the issue.   I have tried stretching before. Although I was never consistent with it."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,DreamHouseJohn,6,Wed Jun 17 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"Try more sumo. Look at Supertrainings Sumo video with ed coan. Very technical lift, but can be great for people with back issues. Also, try doing as many back exercises you can that involve the lower back, BB Rows, DB Rows, Tbar, etc. If something isn't coming up, don't avoid it, structure everything around it. Conquer it."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,RedFormansForehead,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:40:40 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice. It's very hard to round your lower back with sumo. I say you jump on a good deadlift specific program and focus most of your time on that and build up your back. Get someone to check your form, or post a form check here. You need to dial in your technique."

Tight hammies (and glutes) will pull your butt under and cause the lower back to round. Try stretches and foam rolling. If you have already, try again. then again.   Also yes you can develop the deadlift by squating but it's usually low bar. Try partial deadlifts (dimels, rack pulls, block pulls). It can help stretch the glutes and hamstrings."

powerlifting,3a7ooq,ejb30,2,Thu Jun 18 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"Look at your programming. Arguably if you pull less, you will get even worse. Generally if you want to get better, assuming your intermediate, its time to up the volume...mo deads. Deadlifts will increase by doing pulling, however not nearly as fast (due to lack of specificity). Focusing on technique is what warm ups are for man."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,enDelt09,2,Thu Jun 18 04:31:38 2015 UTC,"Dude, if you want to build up your back bodybuilding style, that's fine, but it doesn't necessitate that you stop deadlifting all together.  Keep deadlifting.  In fact, I'd actually work on increasing total volume in the movement, but never go heavier than a weight in which your technique breaks down. Focus on doing perfect, crisp reps in a controlled manner, and do a lot of them.  Afterwards you do your bodybuilding work."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,Lavistao,2,Thu Jun 18 15:06:03 2015 UTC,"Get a lot of high quality, fairly heavy reps. Stay in the 70-80% range. Focus on technique. Pull anywhere from sets of 5 to singles. Doesn't matter. Sometimes don't aim for weight increases, but rather focus on PR'S in your technique or ease of the lift, if that makes sense. Also, back and core work. Every day. Pull ups, ROWS, farmer walks, suitcase lifts, back extensions, you name it. Light weight,  high reps after your deadlifts. Try it. Technique is most important, though. Visualize your lifts and imagine doing them correctly."
powerlifting,3a7ooq,hulkingout84,2,Thu Jun 18 17:13:41 2015 UTC,You can actually not do any and get better. Do RDLs instead with good mornings and box squats. Then work on upper back strength alot also. When you go back just do alot of speed pulls like 12-15x1 with 60-70% with bands or 75-85% without of your comp stance or opposite one for alittle then your comp dead. I jumped from 495 to 565 doing that.

Don't get too jacked up on caffine or smelling salts if you don't normally do it. Don't try equipment for the first time just cause others are doing it. Don't do different warm ups. Try and be in the same mindset that you normally lift in, be it calm or angry.   TLDR: It's best to do what you have been training for instead of throwing all the repeated movements you've practiced out of the window just cause there is a stage. Best of luck."

powerlifting,3a5e7k,findme_06,2,Wed Jun 17 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"It normally wears off around the benchpress so to get through the day you need to stay hydrated, eat small portions of carbs (not too much to feel bloated or to get into a food coma) to last the day, and to have fast sugars like 20 secs before your lift (I have gummy lollies) for each lift.

Opener on each lift was something I could hit for a triple on a bad day, using 2nd attempt to setup the 3rd for PRs. I used Bryce Lewis's (The Strength Athlete - http://thestrengthathlete.com/freebies/ ) attempt selection sheet and had it with me the day of the meet. It gives you three options for each of three attempts in both pounds and kilos so you're not doing the math.  Talk to people! Dont be a chatter box but immerse yourself in the experience - at least thats how I approached it, I didnt really listen to music, I soaked it all in.  Is this a USAPL meet? Dont wander off after your attempt, go and submit in your next attempt within the time window.  Here is a huge post http://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/2wu0fn/what_you_wish_you_knew_preparing_for_your_first/ with 20+ tips and tricks.  Oh lastly, have fun! First time happens once."
powerlifting,3a5e7k,statasaurus,10,Wed Jun 17 13:17:25 2015 UTC,"Reposted with bolded updates:   Check ahead if the meet is in kg or lb and prepare attempts accordingly. Submit first attempts (openers) when you weigh in. Some meets also require submitting rack heights at weigh in, which means you have to get those before you weigh in. Meets should have gear check right after registration. If a meet has gear check you go registration -> gear check -> rack heights -> weigh in -> Waffle House. It is your responsibility to get rack heights, no one else's. You MUST do this before the competition starts. The competition will not stop for you to get a rack height. Be sure you are getting the rack heights on your assigned platform, if it's a multiple-platform meet. You need to get 3 numbers for rack heights. #1 squat bar height #2 bench bar height #3 bench SAFETY height (the arms that catch the bar before it hits your face). If you need boxes for your feet on bench or racks in on squat, write that on your card. You MUST have the following five pieces of equipment. T-shirt, knee high socks, athletic shoes, singlet, briefs (underwear with no legs). Your socks, singlet, and knee sleeves (if applicable) should not touch one another on the platform. Adjust accordingly. Thumb loops on wrist wraps must be off the thumbs and wraps may not be in contact with the bar. Feet flat on the floor for bench. Head down on the bench. Only thumbs-around grip is permitted on bench, no false or reverse grip. Follow all commands: squat and rack on squats; start, press, rack on bench; down on deadlift. Submit your next attempt immediately after you step off the platform. Eat something immediately after 3rd squat and immediately after 3rd bench, even if you're not hungry yet. If it's a big meet (3+ flights on your platform) step outside between flights to get away from the meet environment. You may have heard about the new IPF list of approved equipment. Note that brands for singlets and belts do not have to be on the new approved list to be legal in USAPL competition. Supportive wraps (e.g. wrist wraps) and knee sleeves, however, must be on the approved equipment list. Buy your USAPL card online ahead of time (usapowerlifting.com) to save time at the meet and $5 off the cost of buying it at the meet. Bring your USAPL card and photo ID to check in and have them easily accessible. When you have downtime, watch for red lighted attempts and try to figure out what the faults were. If you don't understand why a lift was turned down (even another lifter's lift), promptly and courteously ask one of the referees. Before the meet starts, pay close attention to the competition bar and the rack/bench. They will probably be different from what you are used to in training, so note any differences in bar knurling/marking/thickness, how much play there is in the uprights, how wide/tall the bench is, etc. In the warmup room, be aware of others both during your own lifts and during theirs. Be available to spot, load, or adjust warmup racks. Ask for help loading your own warmups and ask for a spot when you need one. The only part of your lifting attire you may adjust on the platform is the belt. Everything else has to be put on/adjusted before you step on the platform. Wait for the head referee to announce that the bar is loaded before stepping on the platform. If you do not achieve the correct starting position on a squat or bench (by majority opinion of the referees), you will be asked to replace the bar. Do not panic--your attempt isn't necessarily over. You still have the balance of the minute on the clock to make adjustments and take the bar out again. At the beginning of each round, look to the scoreboard to make sure your attempt is shown correctly. If the number in the computer is wrong, the number that was written on the speaker's card (or attempt card if the meet uses them) takes precedence."

powerlifting,3a351a,MN1H,10,Tue Jun 16 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"why doesn't he recognize the pecs as a primary muscle for the bench press? im not crazy in thinking they are, right?"
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,6,Wed Jun 17 02:05:25 2015 UTC,"By basic biological function, yup.  I think... maybe... what he's referring to is moreso where to focus accessory movements?  Even for people who have issues getting off the chest, I haven't seen too many people who have actually pointed at their pecs as being the issue.  Anecdotal, but my anterior delts are what are failing to get the bar off my chest.  Might be pretty far off with this, but eh.  So, assume that the chest just gets enough work that you don't need to focus on it and instead focus on shoulder and tricep accessories?  Lats should be hit heavily with back work regardless, so nothing special there."
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:19:35 2015 UTC,oh okay then. so does this apply for the other 2 lifts as well? e.i. quads in squat and low back/hips in deadlift?
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,16,Wed Jun 17 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I highly recommend checking out gnuckols' implementing paused squats article.  There's a neat section in there:   Do you want to know what’s limiting your drive out of the bottom of a squat?  Put a light weight on the bar (135-225 works well for most).  Squat all the way down.  Then bounce up and down between full depth and your sticking point (just above parallel).  Do so about 50 times.  What’s the first thing that really starts burning/fatiguing?  Congratulations, you’ve discovered what needs work.   So, for me, the last time I did this test I got quads for squats, hamstrings for deadlifts, and anterior delts for bench (doubly so my left delt).  It's not like other muscles aren't getting fatigued and aren't working, this just kind of gives you an idea as to what's failing first.  I do want to reiterate I'm nowhere near as strong or knowledgeable as a lifter like Andrey, though."
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,6,Wed Jun 17 02:48:50 2015 UTC,"I am a little hesitant to agree with the conclusion Gnuckol reaches from his test.  It seems to me an equally plausible conclusion is the muscle that gets fatigued/sore first is the muscle you're using the most.  Often I believe people find their sticking point is due to a weak muscle that is failing to engage properly.  If that's the case, then Gnuckol's test would not reveal this muscle and lead you to create further imbalance.  Working even harder on the muscles that are engaging would create greater disparity."
powerlifting,3a351a,Buschman98,3,Wed Jun 17 13:41:51 2015 UTC,"That makes sense as well.  The exercise could simply be isolating the primary mover for that portion of the movement.  If that's the case, empowering the primary mover will still help get you through the sticking point.   Often I believe people find their sticking point is due to a weak muscle that is failing to engage properly   For sure, so it's not like one wouldn't work other muscles that are involved.  Just because my chest and shoulders are what are preventing me from getting off my chest doesn't mean I don't do any tricep accessories, just that they're not my focus.  Like you mentioned below, just smash all your muscles and you'll get stronger regardless so eh."
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,2,Wed Jun 17 18:32:33 2015 UTC,so how would you reveal this muscles then? i'm all for getting this information to try out in the future need be.
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,6,Wed Jun 17 14:07:12 2015 UTC,I don't have a solution.  I'm not at all an expert in this field.  I simply question the conclusion Gnuckols reached.   Maybe you could try a gambit of isolation exercises to identify one you struggle at more than others and identify the associated muscles to strengthen?
powerlifting,3a351a,Buschman98,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"intredasting. deadlifting from dead stop to knees x50 would probably be hell though, is that how you did it (assuming your sticking point is lower midrange)"
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,2,Wed Jun 17 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I fail it's because I get it to 1"" off the floor then it dies.  So I picked up 185 to just below my knees until my hamstrings felt like they were on fire.  That was a fun day."
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:04:30 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I worked up to a new 5RM bench. I followed that with a 3RM close grip bench with the same weight.   Secojd time using close grip so I'm not used to it. Had I not benched previously I would have gotten to 5 or even 6 reps with my close grip.   Is it safe to assume that in my case, pecs are really the limiting factor?"
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"Could very well be, actually.  Given how close grip removes a lot of the chest involvement and some of the lateral delt, the conclusion would make sense if your ability is actually the same on both.  I'd say it may be worth working up to something like a 1-2rm if you really wanted to tell.  I've found that I have a much different sticking when working close to 100% as compared to in the 3-5rm range."
powerlifting,3a351a,Targettio,2,Thu Jun 18 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"His phrasing was ""the main muscles that help you lift the heaviest weight and you need to develop are:""  If you are lifting with a tight back then your pec engagement is low, as their main role is to mover the entire should structure forward, but obviously aren't allowing that. Their secondary role of rotating the arm in the shoulder is very limited because you are in a position which gives the pecs a low leverage.  So the shoulder rotation comes from the deltoid, while the lats hold you in position an essentially row you into the bar and your triceps lock the lift out."
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,3,Wed Jun 17 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"If you are lifting with a tight back then your pec engagement is low   if my pecs aren't engaged with a tight back then how come when I bench my pecs get really sore afterwards, and not my front deltoids like you said?  it's for the same reason quads/hips get sore on squats, or back/hips gets sore on deadlifts, because they are getting engaged right?"
powerlifting,3a351a,Targettio,4,Wed Jun 17 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"They are engaged, but in a static hold rather than the going through the full ROM they would in a bodybuilding style bench press or an 'elbows out' dumbbell press.  It isn't the same way quads work in squats, or hips in deadlifts. It is more like back in deadlift. Your spinal erectors don't move far during the lift (questionable statement, but that is a debate for another day), and your traps definitely don't move far; their main function is stability.  So like your back, your pecs can hurt after benching. But (unlike back in DL) they are rarely the weak point for benching, especially for an equiped lifter."
powerlifting,3a351a,squabanchedleft,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"Idk. I mean, I still flare my elbows and engage the pecs heavily IMO while I bench because i can feel them stretch at the bottom. I still retracting my shoulders to create the base to press off of and tuck a little bit, not as low as ive seen others do. I would say the way I bench is pec dominant"
powerlifting,3a351a,Foliage24,4,Wed Jun 17 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"When people say that lats are important for bench, are they saying they're important for stabilizing or actually moving weight?  I just have a hard time imagining how lats directly contribute to pushing upward."
powerlifting,3a351a,M_T_ToeShoes,5,Wed Jun 17 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I think that with a good arch, the motion becomes somewhat similar to a decline bench. So there is a bit of pushing downwards towards the feet relative to your torso. Your lats can do that. I know that trying to ""push with the lats"" helps me maintain my arch and positional tightness too."
powerlifting,3a351a,CuriouslyCultured,2,Wed Jun 17 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"If you bench with your belly up and bring the bar low, the lats act to pull the elbows in towards the body, which along with activation of the front delts is where the majority of the force to get the weight off your chest comes from.  With this style of bench the pecs don't engage heavily until 4"" or so off the chest as the shoulders begin to internally rotate."
powerlifting,3a351a,dickbagdefener,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:39:17 2015 UTC,Do a front lat spread with your hands  kind of in benching position. You'll notice that your hands move forward as you do the spread. I imagine that's how you can tell the lats can help you push on bench.
powerlifting,3a351a,ceejayess,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:16:01 2015 UTC,"Bang out a set of dips and you'll get a good feel of the work your lats do when you're benching. I think they're an important stabilizer for the entire upper body, and I know I definitely owe a good bit of my power right off the chest to my lats."

powerlifting,3a351a,TheAesir,3,Wed Jun 17 10:02:40 2015 UTC,"the technique is part of getting the lats involved in the bench. Hold you're arms out, and rotate the elbows inward. You should feel your lats engage."
powerlifting,3a351a,kanst,2,Wed Jun 17 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"I was taught that as a way to get your lats tight at the beginning of the lift.  If I do it right now, just put arms straight out and turn my elbow down towards my body I can feel my lats tighten up."
powerlifting,3a351a,Foliage24,0,Wed Jun 17 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"I think what he is saying is equivalent to ""tucking the elbows,"" which is a very common technique in raw benching.  Unless you're flared out, you're most likely doing this already. It seems like he was just pointing out form for a bodybuilding bench vs powerlifting bench."
powerlifting,3a351a,Itlan,-5,Wed Jun 17 13:58:01 2015 UTC,That shit looks like an injury waiting to happen.  Does he lift in a shirt or raw?
powerlifting,3a351a,Zosoer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:31:55 2015 UTC,He gives his tips then they show a competition lift and he incorporates an upward body thrust after his pause to give the bar momentum that he never talked about. Is that thrust legal to do in competition?
powerlifting,3a351a,Foliage24,2,Wed Jun 17 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"No downward movement after the press command is allowed. So as long as you start in the lowest position and your butt doesn't leave the bench, its legal in some federations. Some lifters, e.g. Dan Green, will really take advantage of this."
powerlifting,3a351a,Catechin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"Some lifters, e.g. Dan Green, will really take advantage of this.   I think you're getting sinking and just high leg drive conflated."
powerlifting,3a351a,Foliage24,3,Wed Jun 17 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I can see in his lifting, he incorporates both into his technique -- sinks the bar and uses leg drive to drive it up afterwards."

Could you tell us a bit about your weight history? I'm 19 and would like to be a strong 120+ kg lifter as a junior. Do you feel like your deadlift suffers because of your size? Which lifts do you feel gain the most from gaining weight?"
powerlifting,3a279i,treppy,2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely.  Anything to help someone with good goals.  My weight was around 330 lbs in high school (2012) and I was around 585/350/585.  In 2013 I was around 360 and I was at 610/410/605.  In 2014 I was around 390 and at 680/440/640.  Now I'm at 370 lbs BW and just went 750/480/660. But my best WR lifts are 800/490/700 (not that it matters in the weightroom).  I feel as thought my squat gets a HUGE boost with more weight, my bench gets a little boost.  The deadlift is tough when you're big but I can hit positions pretty easily still.  This is all for raw lifting.  Gear is a whole new set of challenges when you're big.  If you have more questions feel free to find me on facebook or something!"

powerlifting,3a30as,Lou__Tennant,2,Wed Jun 17 09:39:01 2015 UTC,I think it is because the lifts cannot be confirmed with 100% accuracy by a human judge. Maybe instant replay would be used?
powerlifting,3a30as,nygmattyp,3,Wed Jun 17 12:08:49 2015 UTC,Surely it's easier to judge than sports like Gymnastics and Synchronised Swimming. Video replays are great and there would be plenty of time between an individual's attempts to judge whether the previous attempt was good or not.
powerlifting,3a30as,Lou__Tennant,2,Wed Jun 17 12:55:41 2015 UTC,That is a valid point I hadn't even considered. Totally seems like a performance would be harder to judge than a squat.
powerlifting,3a30as,nygmattyp,2,Wed Jun 17 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"Powerlifting as a sport is very young compared to weightlifting and other Summer Olympic sports. From what I've read, the flat bench wasn't invented until the 1930's and the strict bench press style wasn't used the 50's. Picking things up and pressing or jerking them over your head is as old as it gets.   People without a background in strength training won't see much of a difference between the two sports in the same way that people without a swimming background can't understand why there are so many swimming events.   /u/nygmattyp's point about judging makes sense.   I feel bad saying this, but I'd rather watch a weightlifting comp than a powerlifting comp. Powerlifting is slow and boring compared to weightlifting."

You'll ultimately want it to be a good experience, since it's rather unlikely that you'll break any records or things like that. Go in as you are and learn as much as you can and enjoy yourself; there's plenty more meets for you to do a cut if you really want to."
powerlifting,3a2ugp,Magic_warlock0-,6,Tue Jun 16 20:12:28 2015 UTC,This makes sense. Removes a lot of the stress and now I can focus all my effort into training and gains rather than diet. Thanks for the advice

I was able to have a big meal the night before the meet and also a sizeable breakfast and lunch on the day of the meet (it was a night comp). I hit a 2.5kg PR in the squat, misgrooved my third bench attempt and failed that PR, and hit a 7.5kg PR in the deadlift.   I don't think I'll bother cutting weight for a meet until I am in a position where the weight cut will put me in contention for records or a spot in the national team."

powerlifting,3a2ugp,partytron69000,3,Wed Jun 17 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"for your first meet do not worry about cutting weight, just go out and compete.  unless there are some type of records you are breaking or that weight class means something to you, it is not worth cutting weight. Just go hit the lift you want and enjoy the experience."
powerlifting,3a2ugp,theefaulted,3,Wed Jun 17 04:43:04 2015 UTC,"Are you close to a record in the 74kg class? If not, then no just compete at 83kg. Only cut for records or nationals and up."
powerlifting,3a2ugp,abaybay1994,6,Wed Jun 17 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"I go against the grain here and I'll gladly take the down votes. If your goals are to lift in a certain class, then do it. This whole notion of no one should ever cut weight for their first meet is ridiculous. Who is anyone else to tell you what goals you should have for yourself? I can only speak for myself but you may be able to relate, but my personality type is one where I want to be the best I can be regardless of who else is competing. Just because no one else there gives a shit about how you perform doesn't mean you shouldn't care either.  Whatever your goals are, go for them."
powerlifting,3a2ugp,CuriouslyCultured,5,Wed Jun 17 00:23:34 2015 UTC,"No one's gonna downvote you for the opinion thanks man :). But I think I am going to maintain weight, and if I still feel like cutting I can do it for my second meet which won't be much longer."
powerlifting,3a2ugp,BeauBrandon,4,Wed Jun 17 00:46:01 2015 UTC,"If your goals are to lift in a certain class, then do it.    I'll not downvote your opinion since we're all entitled to one.  My question is why have goals to lift in a certain class if there is no foundation of previous meet experience to build off of?  Losing 20lbs is no joke for that size person.    I'm of the opinion to go into a meet at the strongest weight you can be (within reason obv)  Cutting 5lbs of water for that size should have little to no effect but larger weight loss coupled with water cuts could have some impact on performance.  If he was more experienced with meets it would be a different story, imo."
powerlifting,3a2j2u,drayeseez,4,Tue Jun 16 18:48:57 2015 UTC,Might be worth waiting for the SBD belt and seeing if that is worth a buy.
powerlifting,3a2j2u,mazze01,2,Tue Jun 16 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing something about that on the sub a while ago, do you have any details?"
powerlifting,3a2j2u,Metallicadpa,3,Tue Jun 16 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"SBD anecdote: People are getting slightly frustrated about the release date. I have a good friend who competes in the masters single-ply IPF (Dean Bowring - I know, I know, dropping names isn't cool, doing it for reference) and has relations to Ben who is the CEO of SBD. Ben, whenever they come up with a product that is somewhat new (may it be high density neoprene foam sleeves or whatever), applies for patents. Until he receives all the rights, they will not release any information on the product.   He also is keen on having products in stock at SBD, meaning, he will order them from the manufacturer, run quality assurance protocols and once he built up a respectable stock he starts selling and sending them to other retailers. That is why SBD sleeves were out of stock at a lot of places for a while, he didn't start distributing them until he had a stock. The chain of order-manufacture-deliver is a little slower. Once a product is in stock, it will be sent.   When it comes to the belt, again, they ""prototyped"" it - from what I heard it is a lever-like solution but adjustable. Hard to imagine but we will have to way I guess. So he is probably waiting for patent approval and/or to fill up his stocks.   At the end of the day, people will buy their products for the high quality. It is only our (customers) impatience that frustrates ourselves.   Strength Shop Belt: I wouldn't recommend the strength shop belts. I had the lever belt and the material just feels inferior to even my old cheap leather belt that I bought off of ebay when I started. Unless you compete soon I would wait. If you compete, either get a belt from Inzer EU or borrow a friends for the competition if you can.  TL;DR - be patient or get an inzer/borrow someones belt for a competition. Strength shop belts aren't as great in my opinion. Also, expect the SBD belt to be around Inzer's price. Keep in mind you only have to buy it once really. Save up a little and it will be worth it in the long run."

I personally went with a Titan belt due to the steep price on the Inzer. You can find a list of European dealers here, http://www.titansupport.com/dealers/ Me being from Denmark I of course bought from the danish affiliate, but there should be a UK affiliate as well I believe. I got a 10mm Lever belt of theirs, and saved quite a bit. Not sure how the prong belts are price wise though."

The other titan belts on the website are double the price which makes me doubtful of the quality.  I'll look into it more when I have time, thanks for the help."
powerlifting,3a2j2u,SirLiftington,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"Just looked over the belt again and the cheaper belt was not a titan, it was a Texas, so on the UK affiliate the Titans are more expensive than the original inzers you linked."

But yea, just ran over the pricing of their prong belts and what not, and there's not really much to save there as opposed to an Inzer.   Run over the IPF approved list and hit up them googles for the specific brands and see if you can find something at a reasonable price within europe, can't really help more than that.  Best of luck with the hunt!"

Now that he left he can hit bigger numbers (for multiple reasons) and lifting in the USPA he won't have to travel as much out of the country.    One thing I remember him asking is how are we spending the $$ earned by these coaching clinics, and why isn't it to fund the world level lifters to travel?

powerlifting,39yg2o,theNightblade,4,Tue Jun 16 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"For the men: I think the names at the top really refute what people thought would come of classic lifting, which was: countries would field two groups of people, 1 for classic worlds and 1 for worlds.  I see equipped lifters in just about every weight class winning medals in classic though, which to me suggests the obvious: The strongest lifters are the strongest lifters both in and out of gear.  If Yuri Belkin had competed and Blaine had made his last pull, almost every winner would lift in both classic and equipped  Fedosienko, Savolainen, Castillo, Wierzbicki, Belkesir (and Belkin would have counted) and almost Blaine all won their groups while being concurrently equipped lifters.    I do not think that Hrynkevich-Sudnik or Bouafia do currently and obviously Williams never has.  Still, that is 5 out of 8"
powerlifting,39yg2o,Daveuall,6,Tue Jun 16 23:13:53 2015 UTC,This excites me having numbers that beat some of these 93kg competitors.
powerlifting,39yg2o,jorge1213,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:48:50 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised with some of the numbers. There are 5 competitors in the 93kg class that wouldn't have even qualified for XPC nationals with their totals (1520lbs is the qualifiying total), let alone a world event."
powerlifting,39yg2o,TheAesir,3,Tue Jun 16 17:37:03 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some differences between XPC and IPF aren't there, from the rule book of XPC: i.e. 24 hour weigh ins vs 2 hour weigh ins, monolift vs. walk out, relaxed judging vs strict judging etc, etc, etc, etc in absurdum. You are comparing apples to oranges. Also... there seems to be some differences between banned substances and ICT and OCT testing procedures between the federations. Ninja-edit #2: i don't know anything about XPC and I don't follow it at all, so I could be sorely mistaken, but in my opinion it's comparing apples to oranges."
powerlifting,39yg2o,TheAesir,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'm comparing powerlifting totals, regardless of federation. The weigh ins don't really matter given its a smaller weight cut to 205 over the traditional 198. XPC has traditionally had fantastic judging, the only significant advantage would be the knee wraps, but that isn't enough to account for some of these embarrassingly low totals for a world meet. Some of these people didn't even total elite"
powerlifting,39yg2o,TheAesir,0,Wed Jun 17 11:41:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding that I am not familiar with XPC, I won't argue with you, but I will not agree with your two remarks. Comparing federations is not something that interests me either, because, generally, altering one variable in a system usually produces a significant change and makes results hard to compare."
powerlifting,39yg2o,TheAesir,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:57:22 2015 UTC,"Then whats the point of even having a unified sport if we can't compare totals across all federations? Just because a few minor factors are different, doesn't mean we have to throw out all comparisons.   For what its worth, by the IPF's own standards, Dr Budai Balazs's total wouldn't have even qualified him to compete at the Arnold's in the USAPL/IPF."
powerlifting,39yg2o,TheAesir,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"I reviewed the results and am in agreement with you regarding the low numbers on some lifters. I don't recall the qualification process from different nations, but I do recall that there is a set number of lifters from each nation that can be nominated to compete in the world championships.   I'm guessing here, but if a nation hasn't fulfilled the ""quota"" with lifters who are competitive in all weight classes, I guess they send anybody who has won their respective national championships to fill the quota. I am not sure if this is a problem at the moment, but as the classic world championships gain a little bit of traction, I guess this will not be an issue in the future as the competition gets fiercer. Was this the second official Classic World Championships? I went to Stockholm/2012 as a coach, but that wasn't official - it was a world cup. South Africa/2014, Finland/2015.. So yeah, I guess this will balance itself out as the years pass.   In short, I didn't comprehend your original point, and you have persuaded me regarding the numbers.   On the other side, in my mind, I'm still correct about comparing results between federations. :) Because this sport is fragmented, oh so fragmented.. Take the following list as an example."

The third week of under 80kg had the highest volume for bench and I chose that week to eat through the grind. A few hundred extra calories the night before really high volume days makes a huge difference.  You can visualize the under 80kg program here.  #37 is more bench focused, #30 squat and deadlift focused"

Jumped straight to dieting for summer. Managed easy 20lb PR on bench (245-265), and 30lb on squat (390-420), maybe more on the table if I did all 12 weeks and peaked properly.   Kept my working deadlift routine that was working well, higher intensity, lower volume. Also skipped any dip/incline/closegrip in the program for 2 days of Hepburn doubles for OHP, singles for Push Press, and weighted chins because I had time and enjoyed those exercises.  I gained ~4lbs. Worksets felt like homeworksets - boring and mindless until I started focusing on rep quality. Put off Sheiko for a long time thinking there's no way volume at lowish intensity would work but it did. It's definitely the template I would jump back on when I'm done dieting."

powerlifting,39zpx0,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 16 13:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah my feeling was that the volume wasn't enough for me, and I learned that my bench really benefits from super high volume. I also did the bench sets competition style using my stop-and-go max  I think I ran 29 and 37 only, I probably should've ran another cycle. I'm still on the first cycle of my conjugate method, so we'll see how it goes when I test out maxes next week!"

powerlifting,39y3f1,gzcl,4,Mon Jun 15 21:57:00 2015 UTC,"The good thing about the worlds was the depth in the classes - it felt like a real competition, much like weightlifting does. This is something Powerlifting needs to alleviate what can be a otherwise boring sport to watch.   It was also really well publicised on social media, and the stream was well handled too.   Not that I don't agree with you that Petkov/anyone else not in the IPF  is a hell of a lifter, I just think that the worlds and the way it was presented was handled was good for the sport and deserves the publicity it got."

I could also export it as a PDF such that you can view the percentages.  It isn't just a straight forward linear progression like starting strength. It is 3 days a week (mon, wed, fri) squat, bench and 2 days a week (mon, fri) deadlift with varying of top sets and reps increasing intensity from the high 70% to the high 80% and low 90% throughout the 8 weeks.  Average daily intensity is somewhere around 72% or because there are many work up sets, but top sets are mainly between 75% and 85% and 3-5 reps."
powerlifting,39wh85,HaughtPockets,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, thanks for the explanation. Varying intensities throughout the week isn't linear, I don't think."
powerlifting,39wh85,HaughtPockets,2,Mon Jun 15 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"No you are right, it is not purely a linear progression. I just wrote that because that is the title of the original program.  It is in a sense a form of linear periodization as apposed to e.g. block periodization or a concurrent approach, because the weights get heavier and heavier week to week and you peak intensity in the end. It is however not a strict linear periodization like traditional western periodization but instead has heavy light and medium days. The program's periodization is probably not as nonlinear as e.g. Sheiko if that makes sense."

I've bastardized the beginner program so it's five days/week by chopping off a few sets, and repeating each workout the day after, so I do a shortened version of the Monday workout both on Monday and Tuesday. For deadlifts of any form, I strictly follow the program, so only Mon-Wed-Fri  While it's much too soon to draw any hard and fast conclusions (I'm on week 2), but, some very preliminary observations:   It feels much more complete and whole than Starting Strength.  It also feels way more fun.  There's variations through the week: low bar, high bar, pause squat and bench, and some understandable plan for accessory work.   I feel fully recovered between each workout. The program has built-in progress from week to week.  Week 2, day 1 felt easier than the same workout from the previous week, despite having added 5kg to both my squat and DL goals."

As for the circuits, make the weight challenging but not heavy enough that you can't complete it, however don't go overboard where you're grinding the last reps because it's just accessory and you want to increase the weight over the next 10 weeks"
powerlifting,39xiyu,CallumTM,3,Mon Jun 15 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"I always used the belt for the speed sets.  I wanted to focus on competition form with speed, and I would be wearing a belt in competition.    As for the circuits, I think that's probably a bit too light.  For the first week, I did 185 for SLDL and Snatch Grip DL (replaced good mornings), and then just used the heaviest weight I could for rows and pulldowns.    By the end of the program I was doing 255x5 for SLDL and SGDL.  The weight of these sets in general is up to personal preference.  Some people like it heavier, some use it as stretching/speed work."
powerlifting,39xiyu,mtw39,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:13:32 2015 UTC,What was your relative dl max?  I also think my row strength is absurdly weak so that will be 135.  I also need to replace lat pulldowns with maybe inverted rows
powerlifting,39xiyu,mtw39,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"I ran the program up to 465 from 430.  So I did that work at about 50%.  I used dumbbell rows and lat pulldowns for that work.  I don't really care for barbell rows.  I think I used 80s for the rows, and I don't remember the pulldown weights."

As for my deadlift now, I messed up my knee twice at the beginning of this year, and am just starting to deadlift again.  I'm back up to about 405, but it's been slow.  I'd like to get back up to 470 or higher by the end of the year, but I'll have to see if that actually happens.  I'm probably gonna start running C/P again in a week or so, so I guess we are gonna be deadlift buddies then!"

powerlifting,39xiyu,levirules,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:31:23 2015 UTC,A target that's about 15-20kg above your max is generally advised. I used it to get from 200kg to 220kg.
powerlifting,39xiyu,levirules,2,Tue Jun 16 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I've read 20-30lbs. 20kg is a pretty steep jump IMO. In my experience, I put on 20lbs each cycle."
powerlifting,39xiyu,Theregoesreality,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:48:44 2015 UTC,"I would only use the belt if you feel you need it. I would not use it during speed sets. A fair amount of the plan is to wreck your back (in a good way), and if you're using a belt during speed sets, I feel like it would detract from the point a bit.  If you're pulling 450, you definitely need to up the assistance. My last cycle was 430 and I started SLDLs at 185 and put 5lbs on each week. I think I started good mornings at 95 and also added 5lbs each week."

It took several months for my body to get acclimated fully to it, but now If I have carbs pre or during training it seems to have a detrimental effect. I do a carb load once a week, and it seems the further I get from my last carb up, the better my strength is. The last meet I did a bunch of carbs after weigh in, and it seemed to be detrimental.   I am not sure why my deads went down. The guy that did my oly programming had snatch/clean pulls at least twice a week, but I was using light weights. I didn't try to lift anything heavier than like 185lbs all that month. My best CJ was 185, and my snatch was only 115. The big problem is mobility for that. He had lots of behind the neck jerks and overhead work, maybe that's why my bench didn't suffer as much."

powerlifting,39um04,limbo2007,29,Sun Jun 14 22:36:15 2015 UTC,Why can't you do both?  Controlled aggression.
powerlifting,39um04,tec5c,2,Sun Jun 14 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's what i have to do sometimes.  but for the lighter and warm up sets, i focus on form.  some weeks, i do nothing but lighter weight and focus on form.  so when i have to rely on adrenaline, my muscle memory works in my favor."
powerlifting,39um04,greenroom628,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:06:57 2015 UTC,Yep... aggression because sometimes that's what it takes and control because you've been going at this so long that you find your groove and that control comes to you almost on a subconscious level.
powerlifting,39um04,rdavis4559,13,Mon Jun 15 05:09:41 2015 UTC,"Do whatever allows you to lift the most weight without injuring yourself. Personally, I deadlift better calm. I squat better when I get jacked up. It's really just preference.  However, one thing I've noticed recently is that with the deadlift (all 3 lifts really, but especially the deadlift), commiting to the pull immediately is important. I find I have a tendency to kinda feel the weight out before trying to really pull it. So I focus on really pulling with 100% effort immediately."
powerlifting,39um04,TheBlackDahliaMurder,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yup. More often than not, if I stop to think about it for even a second, or change something in my set up, I'm going to miss that lift. 100% commitment and confidence and it usually goes up."
powerlifting,39um04,billups,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:43:02 2015 UTC,That's actually a good mental note to have.
powerlifting,39um04,SolipsistRB,3,Mon Jun 15 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"I think its important to get to the point where form is instinct. Where I could scream my face off, get punched in the face, then turn around and perform a proper deadlift.  I do get ""beast mode"" sometimes, but I wouldn't necessarily say I do it at the expense of form."
powerlifting,39um04,WonTonBurritoMeals,2,Mon Jun 15 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"it's all in your head, just as it is for all of us! Sometimes if you dont think about the weight and just lift that bastard, you may surprise yourself lol I only start really thinking about the weight when I go light headed after a few heavy ass sets. Have fun, keep lifting!"
powerlifting,39um04,xXsavagewulfXx,2,Sun Jun 14 22:40:22 2015 UTC,I'd save it for top sets and meets. As your form gets better over time you can use it with your other lifts. I get really fired up to squat and pull because the form now comes natural enough to me that I don't need to think. I forget about it on bench because I suck too much at benching to get my form down without a lot of focus.
powerlifting,39um04,everphilski,2,Sun Jun 14 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"Psyching up never worked for me. If I'm having an off day I lift like crap (like last Friday when I woke up to my garage door covered in graffiti, spent half the morning cleaning that up, got in late to work and lifted like shit after). For me I need to be calm taking deep breaths and then when I'm approaching the bar I play a few bars of my 'trigger song' in my head and I can feel a surge of power but I'm still completely calm, set up, exectute, replace the bar and on to the next lift.   TL;DR need to find what works for you."
powerlifting,39um04,GeneralMillss,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"Basically, what I try to do in my training is to drill the movement into my brain so hard that I don't even have to think about it when it's time to do a big lift. This way, things happen automatically, even when in an aggressive state of mind."
powerlifting,39um04,theNightblade,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:40:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the feed back! I will think about implementing both and try to make my form even more foundational.

powerlifting,39um04,robzomba,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"I lift far heavier when I can tap into that freak lifter inside of me. Helps if there's a scoop of C4 involved... I call it my leopard energy. Dunno where that came from, but that's what it is. However, I won't do it at the expense of form. I find that if I take that extra half second to make sure my form is good, I let that aggression get more built up and it's even better.   Don't sacrifice form, especially in the deadlift. That's a great way to get hurt and put yourself out of the gym for a while. Or at least out of deadlifts."

powerlifting,39tchv,OmnipotentStudent,7,Mon Jun 15 09:13:19 2015 UTC,"From Freddis facebook page: ""Classic Powerlifting Worlds in Salo: Squat and deadlift was what is is. Symbolic.  Bench felt really good and did an explosive 260 in the warm ups and I thought that sky is the limit today. But when it got my opener 270 on straight arms I felt an pop in my left pec. The same spot that popped in Ylitornio in January. The first two attempts was very bad due I could not clue out how to lift when my body protected the pec. I got the advice to the last that try to keep the weight on my triceps. I did it, felt like doing and triceps extencion but it came up in a ugly way, but got it as a good lift. Afterwards I am angry that the chest strained again, but it comes to mind that the last time it popped also was on a powerlifting competition. Does the squat make that I am in a different setup in the benchpress? In a way that puts my left pec in a bad spot? I do not know. But I am pleased that I managed to come back in the last attempt even if my pec hurt like hell and it felt like I would crack the pec completely. The Algerian guy did 270,5 in a good lift and he won the bench. He deserved it. Congratz. The other lifters putted up an real show, especially in the squat! Congratz to them!  Hopefully I can make it to more international competitions in classic lifting, due I really want that record and I want it by a lot.  Thanks for all support and best wishes.  ""A winner always win"". But not today!  Now I will keep 1-3 weeks off from benching. Over the summer I will train like normally but I will also do a lot bicycling with my family and not stress about the lifting. In September the hunt for a 300 kilo competition benchpress starts! You are welcome to follow me in that journey!""  I witnessed this competition live. Injuries happens in sport, and there is nothing you can do about that. By succeeding on the third lift where many would have just noped the hell out of town after a pec tear and after two missed lifts is for me a definition of the word ""will"" and he showed what kind of an athlete he is. Kudos, mayor kudos."

powerlifting,39u1d6,RobinWolfard,6,Sun Jun 14 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"I've tried the Sabo deadlift shoes and the Reebok Crossfit Lite TRs so I can comment about those. I LOVE the sabos. The fact that they have two straps makes it feel like the shoe is just an extension of my foot. They're pretty much wrestling shoes specialized for sumo deadlifting. They're tight and I just feel great in them.   The biggest negatives I have about them are at my school gym the oly platforms are a bit slippery and these aren't quite grippy enough to prevent me from sliding. Obviously no one wants their leg to slide out mid deadlift. However, at my home gym and in competition, their grippy-ness has never been a factor. Other negative is they do feel a bit flimsy for the price. However, Ive used them for many months and they don't seem any worse for wear than they were before so thats not  a big deal either.  Now the Reeboks...I have mixed feelings here. I know a lot of people absolutely swear by these shoes. Firstly, theyre a bit more elevated than the sabos. Probably close to negligible but the heel is definitely a bit higher. My biggest issue with them was how big the toe box was. My foot can slide side to side inside the toe box area because of how wide it is. Maybe this isn't an issue if you have wide feet, but I do not. On the plus side, you can really push out into the sides of these shoes thanks to the ""stability zone"". They also feel pretty damn well made.  So out of these two I gotta say, I greatly prefer the Sabos, though theyre both nice shoes. Worth noting that Reebok has sales on the Reeboks quite often and Ive seen them as low as $40 whereas I don't think Ive ever seen the sabos below $80. Hope this helped at all :)"

I never had a problem with the toe box but I have big fat wide feet.    I've always wondered whether you could take a coarse file and tear up the soles of shoes where the sole is a bit smoother and see if that helps... otherwise I suppose you could lay down a small bit of coarse sandpaper tape."
powerlifting,39u1d6,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 14 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"Just a thought and it definitely isn't perfect, has its share of pros/cons, but you could buy a sheet of grip tape from your local skate shop and stick a few strips to the soles of your shoes. That stuff is pretty durable and grips really well on pretty much anything it can bite into (read: everything but slick cement floors).  The flip side of that is it will bite into laminated surfaces, like most oly lifting platforms, so that could be an issue, but it would be perfect for stall mat style platforms. It is a huge pain to remove from decks, never tried to remove it from something pliable."

The reebok crossfit lite TRs toebox was way too wide for my feet so my feet would slide around inside when pulling sumo. Traction is incredible and over time the shoe has molded to my feet so it fits like no other. I'd like to think of them as the luxury version of the sabos. Only downsides are the price and the sizing is a bit weird so you'll have to email them prior to make sure you get the right size.

All I did for legs was leg curls and shitloads of RDLs. Pain sucks.   Massaging the crap out of my patellar tendon and causing loads of inflammation helped (hurt like a bitch though). Have you been to a physio or anything?
powerlifting,39t8ao,Metallicadpa,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"Tossing random ideas into the air here... My knee was giving me a bad time cos I was doing stretches (particularly pigeon pose yoga shit) and I sucked at it. Which put a lot of strain on it until I stopped. Do you do anything similar...?   Also I think you said in your vid that you do leg extensions...maybe them to blame? I think they have a bad rep for knees  Hope your owie gets better soon. Also release another burrito vid soon, I only have 4 weeks left of fatness till I have to become summer ready again..."

My gym has a small amount of kg bumpers and lots of twelve sided pound plates so for squat and bench I used the pound plates but obviously prefer the kg bumpers for deadlifts and I've become quite comfortable with kgs.  I started at around 180lbs and an added 20lbs got me close to where I am now.  It wasn't until I went from 200 to 220 that in the past seventeen weeks that I took my total from 1261 to 1301 but I'll be honest, that was a bit of an uncontrolled bulk."

Had some time to figure out what needs work, gunning for a 1260-1300 in 198 my next time around.   Giving 5/3/1 a shot again, just to have a little structure. Being in the gym only four days a week feels weird."
powerlifting,39t8ao,rdavis4559,5,Sun Jun 14 15:44:17 2015 UTC,How do you plan on incorporating a cut to 198 while hitting 1260-1300?  I broke 1301 yesterday and I'm at 220 but I'd be optimal at 198 so I'm curious.
powerlifting,39t8ao,euthybro,2,Sun Jun 14 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"I weigh around 210 right now, so it won't be too drastic a cut. I'd be competing again next spring at the very earliest so I'd have ample time to fine-tune things and see where I am. I'm running a deficit right now and trying to at the very least maintain what strength I have but given that I'm using much lower volume now I'm hoping my numbers will increase a little bit in spite of that.

I love Audi and two years ago I was very torn between getting the A4/S4 or A5/S5 versus the brand new BMW F30 335i sedan.  I ended up going with the F30 because it sort of filled a price and performance gap in between the A4/5 and S4/5, had various new improvements over the outgoing E90, and better weight distribution (granted that I don't have AWD and a lot of the typical Audi nose-heavy bias is elminiated by Audi's amazing AWD system).  Regardless, I ended up test driving the A4, A5, S4, S5, TT, and TTS multiple times before I finally landed on the F30.

Over the course of six weeks I slowly worked my way back up in weight as pain allowed and went from 135 to 345 before I finally became pain free and used that to start a new cycle.  Whatever weight started to become painful is where I'd stop and then I'd hop on the leg press and finish the rest with heavy weight for reps so that made up for it some but yeah, whenever I have to deload I hate it and would rather not workout at all or have a contrast week than come in and perform every movement at 50%."

This has you do a solid amount of volume with the main movement once a week and so far its been great! I started with a ~405 max and 4 weeks into the program I hit 420 for a double.  I would play around with both ideas, lots of full deadlifts vs minimal full deadlift and lots of variations, and see what works for you.

I don't really see the need for a peak when my goal is just to build muscle right now, which is why I wanted to cut the last two heavy weeks of the program which jump to 90%+ and cut volume."

powerlifting,39rsn2,ConstipatedDuck,5,Mon Jun 15 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"By that logic we should strap all competitors to a bed for 6 months, and then see who's the strongest after that. Because obviously Dan Green's training program is an unfair advantage.  The point of sports is to see who performs the best under a set of arbitrary parameters. (And yes, the rules defining what ""squats"" are in the IPF's or any fed's eyes are just as arbitrary as the rules of what a ""clean and jerk"" is to the IWF or a ""touchdown"" is to the NFL.) If one of the arbitrary parameters of your sport is ""Thou shalt not use performance enhancing drugs,"" and you use them anyway, you failed to perform under said parameters and your records are meaningless.  Should PDEs be illegal? I don't think so. Tons of people agree and tons others disagree. Are they illegal? Yes."

powerlifting,39rsn2,Aedan382,23,Mon Jun 15 18:34:33 2015 UTC,Amazing lift numbers at low body weights. Dude's numbers are just wow.
powerlifting,39rsn2,smnmblst,23,Sun Jun 14 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"Most of his records, except deadlift, aren't on the lists anymore because he competed using single ply gear that prevents him from being on the raw lists and is blown away by multi-ply numbers. However, the single ply gear of the era was extremely flimsy compared to today's stuff, and it's widely regarded that a squat suit and knee wraps only gave ~100 lbs at most. So he squatted over 1,000 lbs in essentially tight spandex and ace bandages. Even taking off a full 100 lbs due to the equipment, that's a 900 lb raw squat at 220, to go with his 900 lb raw deadlift. He also benched well over 500 at that weight. And he never lost a world championship meet."
powerlifting,39rsn2,nzymx,12,Sun Jun 14 06:47:47 2015 UTC,"Its cause his lifts are still fair way above anything anyone else has achieved. Unfortunately powerlifting had no 'raw' categories back when he competed, so his dominance is under appreciated.  For example, weighing under 100kg, he benched over 250kg raw, deadlifted 410kg raw. For squat he hit 455kg in 80s single ply equipment, and he stated his best raw+wraps squat in training was 420x2.  With this in mind, a 1080kg raw+wraps total at 100kg would have  been achievable if raw was a category when he was at his peak.  To put that into perspective, this is the current raw+wraps records  957.5kg @ 100  1002.5kg @ 110  1080kg @ 125  1100kg @ 140  Similarly when he competed in the 90kg division, he benched 227.5 raw, deadlifted 387 raw, and squatted 384 in single ply. Minus the squat suit he would still smash the current record of 920kg.  Not to mention in the 82.5kgs division, when he was 21/22 he benched 205kg raw and deadlifted 359kg -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43gY9WFXOoM"

powerlifting,39sk3u,endowdly,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:33:25 2015 UTC,Well i guess it depends on what you consider cheap. The equivalent of around $6 per dozen for free range is about 85g protein and maybe 1000 cals which is good but not as cheap as ground beef which is higher in protein. Chicken breasts have become very expensive now too. They used to be a cheap option.
powerlifting,39sk3u,SolipsistRB,2,Tue Jun 16 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"free range   There's your problem. Of course, I buy eggs free range as well for ethical reasons. But still not $6. I pay $4.   One egg has about 7 g of protein. In a dozen you have 84 g of protein. $2.50 to $6 for 80 g of protein.   For one pound of ground beef you're looking at 75-80 g of protein. It does not have more than a carton of eggs. So I don't know why you said that. Also, I cannot find a pound of ground beef for less than $4.50. But you're also looking at a lot more fat and a lot more caloric intake for beef. This may or may not be the goal.   But wait there's more. You can slam two or three eggs and some great protein at little cost and at little room requirements. I can barely finish a quarter pound burger alone and that has about as much protein as two to three eggs. But I can easily eat six eggs and a bunch of fruit and still have room for a drink or protein shake.   You want to get a lot of protein in you for cheap, get supermarket eggs at less than $3."

powerlifting,39sk3u,endowdly,7,Sun Jun 14 13:42:16 2015 UTC,"Bluf -- yes but not really.   Recently, with big studies published by the likes Harvard Medical College and others, whole eggs aren't as evil as previously thought. The majority of new literature I've read concludes that whole eggs aren't damaging to active athletes, yet anymore than one whole egg per day could put an inactive person or a person susceptible to LDL increases from fatty foods into a higher risk category for arterial disease.   The majority of clean protein in an egg rests in the whites. Just shuck the yolk if you're worried about cholesterol. But honestly, now that the cholesterol mechanism is slightly better understood, I haven't seen medical professionals warn on the dangers of ingesting high cholesterol foods to healthy active folk since the late 90s and earlier this century."

I'm far from an expert in these matters, but there must be a limit to the effectiveness of this, otherwise everyone would be doing 45lbs for a thousand reps every session.

powerlifting,39t6f2,ThatsAFreeThinker,2,Sun Jun 14 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Front squats are an accessory lift, it shouldn't matter much what professional athletes are doing in another sport. Do whats comfortable and gets you the results you want."
powerlifting,39t6f2,rdavis4559,3,Sun Jun 14 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know about olympic lifters not wearing a belt, I see them wear belts often enough.  Where powerlifting is concerned you got it, front squats are assistance.   Based on the angle of the torso in high bar, low bar  and front squats, the latter places the most sheer stress on the spine due to the vertical angle.   Front squats have various uses including added quad stimulation while resting the posterior chain and training/strengthening the upper torso musculature as a means of enhancing one's capability to keep upright during any squat variation so yes, a belt is perfectly fine.  The way Dan Green and myself employ front squats is as an assistance movement with its own separate day and with a belt only worn for working sets.   Assistance movements help you to build yourself across both your strong and weak points but you don't let this additional work negatively impact your main lifts so a good rule is to push yourself but only to the point at which you can still recover and benefit from assistance,whatever this means in the context of your own training and objectives."
powerlifting,39t6f2,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 14 16:21:37 2015 UTC,I do them to assist my squats. I have had a problem with staying upright in the past but since I've brought front squats in Ive been a lot better.   I'm wondering if a belt will remove that benefit I get from front squats?
powerlifting,39t6f2,BeauBrandon,2,Sun Jun 14 20:35:59 2015 UTC,"Adding the belt won't remove the benefit front squats give you.  First, any forward lean in the front squat and your ability to keep the bar racked depends upon your grip (clean grip is optimal but an arms-crossed grip will work).  Second, the front squat as assistance usually implies some rep work and not extremely high intensity so the forward lean and problems staying upright are foregone by using relatively lighter weight for front squats.  The belt itself mostly helps only at the bottom when forward lean is caused by butt wink among other things whereas the benefits from front squats are arguably more related to upper torso strength.  Either way, I can use my own programming as an example.  Off season is front squats only one day per week and only triples up to a 3RM and no backdown work.  I go beltless for all but the top set or top two sets and as my top sets and prior sets increase in weight every week I'm essentially increasing my beltless strength and stability over the course of a training cycle.  In season is the same but more like warm up sets to a 5x5, 4x6, 3x8 or something close to that and you can just challenge yourself by going beltless for as many sets as you can but the world won't end if you add the belt in at any point.  You're still working your total body and making gains.  This is not specific to only front squats but the Belt Bible is a good article and Greg Nuckols is much more eloquent and intelligent than I.  http://www.strengtheory.com/the-belt-bible/"

This is the first step in becoming an Olympic sport. As of right now the IPF is the only recognized powerlifting federation by sport accord, a necessity for IOC recognition.  But if we are going to gain IOC recognition we have an agenda to stick to. We have made great progress on this agenda but there is still a long way to go. It is great that we had an IOC diplomat at Classic Worlds, it shows that thing are moving in the right direction.  However, the steps to becoming an Olympic sport go far beyond IOC rec recognition. The process can be googled if you are interested.   IOC recognition is HUGE, and I feel that we are close. Hopefully within the next 5 years. But talking about actually being in the 2020 or 2024 games is distracting from the goals we have set out now."

Candito, a pretty obvious natty, is 13 years younger and a weight class below and is within 200lbs of Norton's total.

He's no stronger than Blaine who will be tested at at least 4 competitions this year and probably a few more OOC so I doubt he'd be able to get away with much  I'm not trying to play a guessing game but I'm not going to point any fingers at anyone until they either: Admit it on camera or online like some morons have done, get a Phelps style photo taken, or fail a test"

He's a strong, strong guy. But you don't get to his size naturally. I really can't see how people would claim Layne Norton isn't natural, but support Ray Williams' claims of being natural, when he's 50kg+ heavier iirc (Ray weighs in at 150kg roughly right?).  I agree though it's unideal to make assumptions. I just think some people seem to have rose-tinted lenses in some cases, whilst being absolutely unflinchinly accusatory in other instances, which is myopic and regressive."
powerlifting,39plx9,MoralEclipse,4,Sat Jun 13 20:57:13 2015 UTC,Because Ray Williams has a lot of fat as your bodyweight goes up how lean you can be also decreases. I really don't see why you wouldn't believe someone could get to Ray's physique it just requires eating loads and lifting. It is more the unbelievable strength but I think that is more to do with being a genetic freak than steroids.
powerlifting,39plx9,mankytit,2,Sat Jun 13 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"The genetic freak thing works both ways. Not everyone has the sames response to gear, some users just respond to the compounds way better than others due to their genetic predisposition."
powerlifting,39plx9,MoralEclipse,2,Sat Jun 13 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"True but again I think one can generally not tell if someone is on gear solely from strength, you have to look at body composition, training, progress speed, etc."
powerlifting,39plx9,ascenzion,0,Sat Jun 13 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"What? Ray Williams is fat, yeah, but he's also incredibly muscular, way more muscular than is possible naturally. You really think people can get to this size naturally?  I can't see why people would claim Layne Norton is using steroids, when at 93kg he's well within range for FFMI etc for his height, yet will defend Williams who is obviously way over what FFMI would consider natural limits. I mean the guy's over 140kg @ around 6', and he's notmorbidly obese. You surely can't think he's somehow natural when guys like Koklyaev who walk around at 160kg @ 6'3'' are just assumed to be using gear. And surely the Russians could be said to have just as many 'genetic freaks' as the US, considering they have the raw+ WR Super (Malan), a 26-year-old who benches 720lbs and is looking to take the bench WR (Sarychev), and arguably the overall greatest strength athlete ever (Koklyaev). Yet everyone assumes the Russians are using gear, while letting countless others off just 'because'. Americans seem to have this weird aspect of their fitness/sporting culture wherein they dismiss black athletes as 'genetic freaks' when many of them- especially college football players- have been using boatloads of orals since they were 12 to remain competitive athletically (played D2 football trust me when I say over 80% of the guys on the team were using/had used).  'Genetic freak' is simply a massive cop-out. People simply do not get that big naturally no matter how crazy their 'genetics' are. He's a high school football coach. Football is notorious for the rampant use of PEDs especially orals."
powerlifting,39plx9,MoralEclipse,0,Sat Jun 13 22:12:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly people assume the russians are using because they compete in untested feds, I would give them the benefit of the doubt if they are competing in the IPF.   Also I believe Ray Williams physique could be achieved naturally. Firstly FFMI doesn't apply to people who aren't lean and Ray is probably 20%+ bodyfat. It's not likely he is much bigger or leaner than your average IPF SHW. Also how is genetic freak  a cop-out, there will almost certainly exist people who can get far stronger/leaner/more muscular than your average person, so I wouldn't compare Ray or Layne to your average guy."

Ridiculous, of course, but myself to blame, it was necessary to thoroughly check everything. And now himself summed without showing excellent form in the competition, and led the team even more ...

As far as I know (this was told to me by a med student yesterday, when discussed) it would only ever be prescribed to pre-menopausal women in relation to breast cancer, which estrogen can 'feed'.

If someone started training under heavy ""enhancement"" at 16 y.o., for 10 years, then came off under a more ""sparse"" steroid regime and only then started competing, would you still consider him natty? Couldn't he could stop completely and still reap the benefits of 10 years of enhanced training, with no chance of any drug testing frequency detecting anything?

CYC, Walgermo, Bakkelund, the girls who's names are too hard to remember.  Yes.  Until one of them tests positive they're clean to me.  I'm naturally suspicious of Russian Egyptian and Khazak lifters because of their history but Norway's entire mantra is ""Play Clean"" and they do OOC testing for their top people all the time.  Its not a question of what I believe, when someone gets WADA tested ~24 times a year they're either really fucking smart and rich or they're clean.  I doubt CYC has the money to beat tests like Olympic guys do or NFL players, and i kinda doubt he's just pounding test suspension every morning and getting lucky about skipping the days he gets tested, so yeah he's either clean or he's gonna get popped real soon.  He even does Euros most years!  That's nationals and two IPF meets.  So he's getting tested both by Norway and the IPF.    The last Norwegian to fail a test strike out in IPF competition was in 1993:  http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Anti-Doping/IPF_current_ADRV-list_2015_02_25.pdf  Norway had no internal failings this year: http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Anti-Doping/national-doping-reports-2014_2015_04_06.pdf"

powerlifting,39plx9,SwordfshII,4,Sun Jun 14 08:36:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. I was mistaken in that it is a Phd not MD (btw you can also be a DO as a Dr). But I have read most of his Pubmed articles and knew he had access to research labs
powerlifting,39plx9,dwightshoulders,2,Sun Jun 14 08:38:32 2015 UTC,You don't have to have a phd to get bloodwork done. It costs $40 at your local lab.
powerlifting,39plx9,SwordfshII,2,Mon Jun 15 00:25:05 2015 UTC,"...duh... he knows enough to calculate half lifes, dosage protocals testing windows, metabolites, etc....the phd just shows he isn't freaking Boston Llyod. He probably would also want to test himself to reduce potential for a leak or evidence that would discredit him"
powerlifting,39plx9,dwightshoulders,0,Mon Jun 15 00:42:36 2015 UTC,So you're saying hes natty all the way?
powerlifting,39plx9,goochadamg,11,Sat Jun 13 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"Regardless of his credentials, it's a silly baseless accusation. There is no evidence Layne is using. No matter what, someone is going to be the best. And often, the best is far and above beyond what the average (e.g. the majority of us) can do. That great strength isn't at all evidence of use. And go poke around /r/steroids and take a look at some of the numbers those guys are putting up; it's pretty clear strength is not a necessary and sufficient condition for steroid use.    Truthfully, the whole thing isn't really even worth discussing. It's impossible to know either way."
powerlifting,39plx9,goochadamg,-2,Sat Jun 13 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"I know steroids alone don't make a strength athlete. I think you entirely misunderstood my comment.  I was literally saying there is no evidence. Either way.  You also may want to look up what ""necessary and sufficient condition"" means."
powerlifting,39plx9,goochadamg,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Reread my original comment, but I'll be simple and clear here so you can see that we basically agree.  Just because Layne is far stronger than the average natural lifter, does not mean he is on steroids. Just because he is 'the best', does not mean he is on steroids.  There is no evidence he is on steroids."

Simple human biology.    edit - if he was early mid 20s hitting PR after PR  and doing these exact same lifts at the exact same BW I would see zero issue with it at all.

powerlifting,39plx9,n3ver3nder88,19,Sat Jun 13 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's either because he's actually natty and getting multiple accusations a day dismissing your hard work is really irritating, or it's Lance Armstrong: Powerlifting Edition.

powerlifting,39plx9,crazy_brain_lady,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:50:36 2015 UTC,I feel like he does a little bit. Not many of the other American IPF lifters do so much really.   I do think people talk about it a lot though as they consider him a 'tool' (not my words). I don't think that's a valid way to determine whether someone is natty or not obviously. I just find it weird the natty or not hype around him.
powerlifting,39plx9,duckman273,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:39:08 2015 UTC,Probably because he's worked his whole life towards doing something and people like this are constantly attempting to discredit him with baseless accusations.

powerlifting,39plx9,JEH0VAHG0D,-1,Sun Jun 14 00:38:38 2015 UTC,I agree he is a good lifter with or without gear.  Obviously a smart dude.   The only issue I have with him is the protesting and all his Mr Natty crap. If he would just drop it or just state  the obvious then guess what  .....no one would care.
powerlifting,39plx9,MoralEclipse,2,Sun Jun 14 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"Layne has been training for over a decade and is pretty light for his height, I really don't find it that unbelievable that someone who has dedicated their life to bodybuilding/powerlifting could look/lift like him. Also regarding him constantly talking about being natty, that means nothing he constantly talks about lots of things, he is clearly a guy who takes his reputation and online arguments very seriously (probably too seriously).  Also from what I have seen of his progress and training it really looks like training of someone who is at least currently not on gear, i.e. very slow progress requiring incredible levels of volume and really pushing the limit."
powerlifting,39plx9,JEH0VAHG0D,-6,Sun Jun 14 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Almost 2x BW bench and 3x BW squat and DL + over 30 where your natural levels start to drop....lol.  Also the misnomer that while on gear you always are making PR after PR after PR is not only foolish but untrue.  He looks like a life time user just not someone who jumped on last week.
powerlifting,39plx9,MoralEclipse,2,Sun Jun 14 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"I am not far off those numbers and have been training for a bit over three years and am still progressing well, so if you think that is the absolute natural limit you are way off.

I could care less if anyone wants to take medicine to become bigger and stronger than otherwise possible, but to do so, and enter an IPF competition is so cheap. Everyone knows that that clown Norton juiced his balls off to become a bodybuilder in the first place which in my reckoning is fine, it kind of is a part of the sport in a sense. One could really start to wonder, however, if he completely dropped them since he got the idea to join the IPF. Even though he MIGHT be off the gear now the positive effects he sustained from previous cycles are still of great importance since it is suggested that the drugs will affect you long after you stop.  All he ever does is brag about how smart he is while waving his so called ""PhD"" around but he still can't figure out that he doesn't belong in the IPF. Talk about having no morals."

powerlifting,39plx9,alkeskog,2,Sun Jun 14 06:14:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but the IPF has really tried to clean up their federation the past couple of years. The whole ADAMS program couldn't make that any clearer. There isn't a whole lot of money in powerlifting; You might get some if you're sponsored but that doesn't depend on if you are in the IPF or not. So my point is that I don't get why enhanced athletes still pick the IPF, there are plenty of enhanced federations to choose from. If however, there was big money involved I'd see the bigger picture."

powerlifting,39rtqb,mistafisz,6,Sun Jun 14 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"Stick to flats for deadlifting. As Draskal below alluded to, deadlifting and cleans are not the same thing on the first pull. Two totally different mechanics. Any o lifter will tell you the power is generated from your legs primary which is why you'll have a more upright torso (hips more down like a squat) unlike a traditional deadlift pattern where the hips are going back.   The reason you wear oly shoes for cleans is it forces your body to be more upright. Yes you'll see different set ups and exceptions from various lifters but as a Olympic Lifting coach it's one of the first habits your trying to break in a powerlifter is that a clean pull is not a deadlift."
powerlifting,39rtqb,ProfHotTub,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:58:37 2015 UTC,For me using shoes with a heel for deadlifts will result in increased quad activation but I can't use my glutes to lock out like I would with flats. I would give it a go if I were you.
powerlifting,39rtqb,captainsalt1,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"I pull with my olys bc I'm weakest in the quads/right off the ground, so it works like a deficit pull. It's the same reason I pause my pause DLs as soon as I come off the ground.   However I also cycle in regular pulls in flats every couple of months. If I were you, I wouldn't pull only in olys. Especially if you're doing it to circumvent a mobility issue, I would still try to fix those ankles!"

powerlifting,39rtqb,acewolk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:43:21 2015 UTC,The clean and jerk is done with olympic shoes and that starts as a deadlift. In the big scheme of things it won't hurt but focus on fixing that mobility.   Edit: it appears the clean is different from a deadlift but I still maintain that a couple weeks of pulling in olympic shoes isn't a big deal.
powerlifting,39rtqb,powerliftinglife,3,Sun Jun 14 04:39:50 2015 UTC,If we're being nitpicky the clean really doesn't start like the deadlift.
powerlifting,39rtqb,acewolk,2,Sun Jun 14 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good point, good solution to this particular problem. I do have a minor technical question. I realise that this is a highly nuanced area, but is there not a distinction between the Olympic 'pull' and the deadlift? I'm not a weightlifter, but I was under the impression that there was a discrepancy in the starting hip height, speed, knee angle etc.   Sources http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/deadlifts-vs-clean-pulls/ https://youtu.be/mPsxlNjv7Aw?t=7m41s"

It will also lead to a much higher degree of quadricep recruitment and less hamstrings so over time you'll develop imbalances unless your training is not purely powerlifting oriented.

Feel the tub high enough so when you sit in it it reaches chest height. Dump the ice and submerge my whole body. Make sure you wear some sort of underwear and socks to prevent any damage. This might now work depending on your tub size and your individual height. I'm a Manlet standing at 5'9 so I fit in my tub but that's not the case for everyone

I never had any problems arise by not wearing socks or underwear.  I'm 5'8"" and my prior apartment had a shorter tub but my current one is a bit longer.  I did find that getting into the water and then dumping the ice in was a bit easier though I did learn well enough to Leeroy Jenkins the process when I did dump in the ice first."
powerlifting,39riez,Pritulas,6,Sun Jun 14 05:20:01 2015 UTC,"Ice baths are more beneficial for high active sports (like soccer players as mentioned). The amount of lactic acid build up in prolonged bouts of stress is much greater than with powerlifting. Oddly enough, something that will speed up recovery is going for a short, easy bike ride. 10-15 minutes. The blood will flush through the muscle and help in the lactic acid removal.   At the same time, I have no idea, this is just what my physio said, because I had asked the same question."

powerlifting,39riez,rdavis4559,2,Sun Jun 14 05:21:38 2015 UTC,I have a bunch of those freezable gel packs. Fill the tub with some cold water and throw em in. It doesn't get as cold as real ice bags but saves money if you don't have access to an ice machine.

powerlifting,39qt4p,YetiDick,6,Sat Jun 13 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"I'm currently using it now, 6 weeks in (around half way). I currently go deads/bench/rest/squats/bench+ohp/hypertrophy/rest.  Previous history: December 2013-March 2014 SL5x5, then a few months of mad cow, then pissing around during rugby, GZCL, another season of rugby in 2014 (in season is 2 days a week trying to maintain/minimise strength loss), then did a Jacked and Tan style approach.   Jacked and Tan style was pretty high volume for me, about 4 days a week, repping out every day. Workouts around 1 hour 30 mins. Put 15 kg on my squat, 20 on dead and 10 on bench in 10 weeks. Under this program I hit 150 for 11 no belt high bar, 165 for 7 and 200 for 1 low bar with belt, and benched 105 for 8 or something (poverty bench, actually poverty everything). Keep in mind this was while running every three days a week.  So got into another season of rugby, got concussed twice and quit so I am now training to do a meet in November to give me something to do.  Now for the program.   I have found the days to be short, like some Bench days I can get done in 40 minutes. This is good because when you are in a rush it gets done, but you always have time to add something if you want. I don't really add anything, sometimes just some really light work as I'm working on sumo deads. Only thing i have consistently added is back work.  I always do 3-4 sets of a back movement on every programmed day, and 10-12 sets on the hypertrophy day. This is mostly due to my experience with GZCL program and his way of training back. There are only 8 sets of back programmed each week. If you do this program add in some more back and bicep work in my opinion.  You can see what I have done here:https://thesquatrack.com/profile/benscott  Deadlift: I hadn't deadlifted in around 6-8 weeks as it was wrecking my recovery from rugby, so some of this is just getting used to deadlifts again. Deadlift is going ok, good to add in some sumo work. I'll probably add in more sumo work in the next cycle. Other assistance lifts I'm doing are deficit deads and rack pulls. Fucking hate rack pulls they destroy my back. Going to check over my logs and see if I ever really benefited from rack pulls besides using them in the weeks prior to testing for overload. If not I will change these to pause deadlifts and more sumos next cycle.  Squats: Nice change from amraps all the time (I enjoyed the shit out of amraps though, in a sadistic way). Speed, strength and rep days give good variety, easy to recover and most importantly practicing the movement at a lower intensity. These have been going awesome, squatted 180 for 7 (previous 2) on the 4th week on strength day top set, and 200 for 1 (old fresh max) after my rep day. I train at home so don't have a back extension or GHR so am making do with planks, swiss ball curls, SLDL etc.  Bench: Been doing all wide and normal grip paused but read today to do my second bench day as TnG and heavier. Thats similar to what I have done in the past and works well for me. Benching has been going ok, I'm pretty shit at speed bench but the reps and strength is going well. Haven't PRd on my normal bench yet (apart from volume PRs) but have increased my close grip and my wide grip. The assistance  is close, wide, incline and incline dumbbell, doing 2 of these a week. When I go in on saturday to the uni gym I do 4 x10-15 dumbell bench, some cross overs, some DB shoulder press and some bi and tris to help with bench and increase my volume.  OHP: OHP is a bit of an afterthought in this program, and OHP is by far my worst lift (70% BW, just over half my bench). I mix it up  between military and regular stance depending on how I am feeling. However with the limited OHP work my OHP feels slightly stronger in terms of strength, but farm better in terms of feel (more stable). I feel like the lower percentages and reps per set have trained the groove as I was guilty of just pumping through reps on past programs without giving it much thought.   I plan to finish this cycle, peak and then test my maxes. I will then do 3 weeks of sumo/high bar/ other variations just to mix it up and recover. I will then start training with a full cycle leading up to my meet.  In conclusion, the I am seeing good progress but it has only been 6 weeks so take it with a grain of salt. I'm also coming off less frequent/structured training so I was always going to see some gains. I have shit diet and sleep due to being a uni student but I still have no problem getting through the days. I enjoy the program, the structure and rep scheme. It does seem a bit low on volume but it does encourage upping things if you feel good, which I do maybe once or twice a week. I plan to run this program again and use it for my first meet. After that I'll probably write a full review. Any questions feel free to ask and I'll try answer with my limited knowledge and sorry for the wall of text.   SUMMARY: Low volume, good variation, fun to run. Strength days or rep days can be hard if your under the weather but overall it isn't too bad. Rack pulls suck but I'm keeping them for now. Add back work and don't be afraid to add a couple reps or plates if your feeling good. Use it as a guide and add some extra stuff if you know it helps. He wrote it himself and he knows whats good for him, plus he is around 30 so recovers slower. Still a good hybrid of boss/cube etc. Also I enjoy his youtube and watching it gives you goo ideas on how its run."

powerlifting,39qt4p,rdavis4559,3,Sat Jun 13 23:01:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried it but both Brandon and I were training under Dan Green at the same time and when reviewing the program after Brandon released it I did recognize a lot of cues he took from Dan's training ideology.  Granted the program is somewhat of a hybridized cube/boss, four days per week rather than five, and seemingly lower volume on main lifts as well as assistance and accessory movements.  It looks solid - a bit different from my own programming which is still roughly 70% based off of Dan's but Brandon and I have both continued to make gains and we each have our own unique strengths, weaknesses, schedules, and recovery abilities."
powerlifting,39qt4p,rdavis4559,3,Sat Jun 13 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"I've done several write ups and produced several comments regarding his programs but I can't say for certain whether the one you say was written by me.  if you look at my comment history you should be able to find where I've expanded upon his programs in further detail and how I've been running my own modified version of his off season high frequency squatting program within which I applied the same high frequency methodology for Bench.  I did  provide a link to a sort of generalized template for this high frequency routine. Link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddffmv29ulbhtpp/RBBSM%28HIHF%29_Sample_2015-00-00_to_-.xlsx?dl=0 Read Me: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xubk49s32m3id6m/RBBSM%28HIHF%29_Sample_2015-00-00_to_-%20Readme.txt?dl=0  You can tell that the read me is generic and reiterates some things I've already mentioned here, all O did today is update the rep max PRs.   I loved Dan's programs, both the off season one and the two in season variants I completed.  All three programs had two Bench days and one overhead press day per week along with two squat and one DL for in season and four squat, two of those including DL in off season and all three programs were five days per week.   At the start I had been running my own bastardized 531 and prior to that mostly bodybuilding work that included S/B/D and all of that incorporated a respectable amount of volume so going in under Dan and using his amount of volume was still an increase for me but not a shock and not at all unmanageable, granted that my body works best with a combination of high volume, intensity, and frequency.   Cube Boss  itself is actually just Brandon Lilly's cube method in one of its iterations but has little to do with Dan's own programming.  To my knowledge all cube variants are low frequency.   further, Dan doesn't cycle speed, rep, and intensity days.   Main lifts under Dan don't go above six reps (for competition grip bench) or five reps for high or low bar squats and deadlifts.   Some assistance e.f. front squats, Wide or close grip bench, and deficit deadlifts can get up to eight reps but anything above that is accessory work e.g. dumbbell incline Bench, Rows, dumbbell overhead press, etc.  Dan's only speed work is done whimsically as part of main lift warmup sets  but not explicitly programmed anywhere.  I should say that when I began Dan's programs I felt that the variety of paused work, Wide and close grip work, deadlifts from deficits and elevated Heights, and anything else that increased ROM or hit things from different angles helped me a lot as did some form of Lat work five days per week.    I've never run the cube method in full but I did feel like changing up my main deadlift day once and used my rep max percentages for the cube deadlift rep days and I can say that I'll never do that again.   it was fun but conventional deadlifts at around 75% and then deficit deadlifts at 70% for 3x12 are pretty destructive on your hands and that comes in at #3 on my list of record heart rates at the end of the final set  (#2 being the final set of 10 rep beltless squats at 72% when I hybridized Dan's in season with Ed Coan's three lift ten week program (not the Coan/Philippi DL program) and #1 being HIIT sprints which got me to 183bpm albeit that was around 30lbs ago). The roid thing is disputable because individualized training adaptations still apply.  Dan runs the same off season program that I ran  at various times in his training though he's averaged a higher than normal and higher than preferred amount of competitions in the past two years so he's had less chances for it.  regardless, he's obviously geared pharmaceutically speaking.  The Lilliebridges, Matt disbrow, and various other lifters only squat once per week and they are also taking the ubermensch juice or as Greg Nuckols put it, ""vitamin S.""  some lifters can't recover as well from much frequency paired with intensity and I can see that being true given the stress on connective tissue as well as lean tissue.  Anyway, the point is that you'll find truth in viewpoints at either end of the spectrum."
powerlifting,39qt4p,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Sheiko is somewhat similar to my high frequency program but I probably have intensity set higher by a good margin.  Benching alone doesn't beat me up but the combination of paused benching, heavy deadlifts, and accessory grip work e.g. farmers walks and hanging leg raises without ab straps can make my forearms tight at times.  Back squatting so much and occasionally losing focus causes me to place more load than necessary on my left bicep while holding the bar in place and benching can occasionally aggravate that to an extent but it's all good.   I'm really not that beat up and in seventeen weeks I haven't failed a single squat and only failed a bench attempt two or three times.    How built is your upper body right now?  I was born to squat and deadlift and haven't the highest numbers for each of these lifts in my gym and with respect to physical presence I have only seen one person in my life deadlift only slightly more than me.  I realize that normally this would only speak to my surroundings more so than my own capabilities but the point in me saying this is that despite my squat and deadlift strength I'm probably #15 on the list of strongest bench pressers in my gym but people are usually deceived by my upper body size and definition and assume that I'm a much stronger bencher than I truly am.  Granted, most of the stronger benchers either don't squat, don't deadlift or don't do either and probably get more recovery than I do.    For me what worked best to up my bench control and technique was simply paused competition grip and paused wide grip bench.  The wide grip does work your pecs more but it also felt better to me for learning the control of lowering the weight, staying tight, using your lats as a platform, and then pressing off.  Pausing in general also helps.  I pause every single bench rep I do except for dumbbell bench and close grip.  Slingshot bench on my bench doubles day has also helped.  I normally work up to a 2rm then add 15lbs, put on the slingshot and match that rep scheme for two sets (2x2).  The slingshot does help with learning control and especially the lowering phase but I like it for getting the feel for heavier weight in your hands, it sort of trains you to understand what that heavier weight feels like so that is isn't as much of a shock in the coming weeks.  As far as bench strength, for me the high frequency and high intensity helped.  I don't discount the complexity and amount of technique required for squatting and deadlifting but sometimes I believe that bench is the lift that takes the most conscious effort and control at least from my own body.  Without going into the intricacies of limb placement, specific cues, and all of that, I can say that for squat, bench, and deadlift the most important factors are breathing and tightness.  A lot of lifters learn how to get their bodies perfectly tight and taught to initiate lifts but the tightness is lost throughout the movements.  Keeping that tightness and being conscious of full control of the major muscle groups employed per each lift is what helped me to progress but it takes years to learn.  Further, this knowledge can be so easily forgotten and can always be improved, it's a battle that will last your entire lifting career."
powerlifting,39qt4p,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"I also have large legs - big quads and hams and leftover mega calves (I lost 100lbs ten years ago and while I dropped down to skin and bones, my calves remained.  FYI this is the best calf builder.  If anyone is interested, gain 100lbs and then lose it all).  My back is pretty thick as well.  I'm built for both squatting and deadlifting and my body can handle most everything thrown at it but bench is just average.  I recently went about .25"" wider on my grip on each side and this helped some but I'm not at maximum legal width yet.  I don't use leg drive at all and sometimes on max attempts I think too much and end up pausing for too long at the bottom but chest strength has always been fine for me.  I've never failed off of the chest, mid-range to lockout is my weakness and that's why the slingshot is a great tool - I get the tricep overload from it.  I don't arch much, perhaps enough for half of a tennis ball to fit underneath me.  As I mentioned prior, wide grip is great for building pec size and strength so perhaps you can give that a try.  As for the slingshot, it's a moot point if your problem is chest strength but I've heard the entire howmuchyabench.net site has a 15% off discount right now.  The original and reactive slingshots are normally priced at $55 and $50.    Some sort of rowing/chin up/pull up movement five days per week made my lats dramatically increase in size and that in turn decreased the ROM required for my bench and also gave me a nice platform to lay down on.  Greg Nuckols didn't train lats for years and was just fine but I've found it to work for me.  Everyone keeps talking about how great Sheiko is.  I've always wanted to give it a try but I also don't want to quit what has been working for me until it stops doing so.  Perhaps someday...."

powerlifting,39ltkh,Asian_Persuasion,16,Fri Jun 12 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer, I'm firmly in the first camp.  In my opinion, the problem is that people look at powerlifting as a test of strength. It's not. The question isn't who's stronger, it's who can lift the most weight. Those are two very different questions, and I think the reason benching is so polarizing is because it's this weird metric of every day strength (how many times has someone asked you what you bench when they find out you lift?)."

powerlifting,39n4af,_predator_,2,Sat Jun 13 08:17:04 2015 UTC,Can't really help you with your question but I feel you brother. I'm living in Northern Germany (Kiel) where it's even a pain in the ass to find a proper gym.   I think the best way to find local powerlifters is to talk to some on meets and ask them if they can help you out. I bet there are some old Powerlifting / Weightlifting clubs that just don't have an internet presence. Good luck.

Maybe it helps if you search for the more traditional german name of 'Kraftdreikampf' instead of the english term.  Although I have never been involved with it myself, I know of one group for raw powerlifting with this internet page: purepowerlifting. They largely seem to do exclusive bench pressing contests though, and not much in Southern Germany."

powerlifting,39n4af,_predator_,2,Sat Jun 13 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"Is it different where you come from then?  One could probably write a lot about the reasons, but it most likely has to do with the working culture here. Spending so much energy on lifting weights seems to be considered a vain and frivolous waste of time. Ruining your health by working overtime is held in much higher regard.  If you have a chance to change the gym, you could look for a 'ProFitness' or a 'McFit' yet. One has to consider putting up with these names as part of the mental training aspect."

powerlifting,39nsvg,kraken514,3,Sat Jun 13 10:24:28 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree though it is worth noting that a recent study found specifically rectus abdominus activation to be greater in overhead squats than in either squats or deadlifts.  I personally find beltless training to hit my obliques to a greater extent while I get decent abdominal stimulation with a belt.  I train both with and without a belt for squats and deads.  My other indirect core work is overhead pressing and farmers walks though one could argue for barbell rows and dumbbell rows as providing slight core stimulus as well, not to mention chinups and pullups which have been shown to increase core activation well above seated chin ups and pull downs.  My direct core work is hanging leg raises, ab wheel rollouts, and decline weighted crunches if I feel like it, the latter always done without using intertia and always without a lack of lumbar flexion and thoracic spine flexion to a minimal extent.  As far as a challenge when crunches go beyond 45lbs with a plate or a challenge well beyond planks?  Dragon flags.  Dragon flags are awesome."

powerlifting,39nsvg,Danneborger,0,Sun Jun 14 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't really call Good mornings or hyperextensions core exercises, but I would say they're basically interchangeable. However, consider this interesting article on this topic: http://bretcontreras.com/wp-content/uploads/Are-All-Hip-Extension-Exercises-Created-Equal.pdf  Tldr; the torques curves of the back extensions, 45 degree hyper and good morning mean that although they are similar hip movement patterns they impact muscles differently. Goodmornings impact hamstrings more than anything, back extensions focus on glutes and 45 degree hyper offers a good mixture of both.  Another point to consider is that good mornings CAN be dangerous (Candito has a video on the topic). Given that you are changing direction at the most difficult part of the lift it has a greater potential for injuring you. If you are going to do good mornings, make sure you can deload and reset (onto chains or safety rails) at the bottom of the movement. However, my preference would always be to use the sldl instead  Why are you looking to utilise these movements?"
powerlifting,39nsvg,powerliftinglife,2,Sat Jun 13 13:33:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, GMs and hypers aren't really core exercises, nor are glute ham raises.  One could argue for the lower section of your erector spinae as being core musculature but the movements just mentioned are much more of a glute/ham focus.  I've never liked good mornings, I find stiff leg deadlifts to be so much better and I love them.  I also love the hyperextension as a very quick 10-rep warmup on my squat and deadlift days.  I set the hyper pad at a level where there is less focus on hams and more of a focus on glute contraction and this helps with glute activation.  I got the idea from a Bret Contreras T-Nation article and honestly, this hyper with a glute focus helps me with activation more than a hip circle or bodyweight glute bridges ever did. https://www.t-nation.com/training/best-damn-posterior-chain-exercises"

As a result, I'm currently changing my form to make sure that it's competition legal and I'm definitely finding that there's been a pretty humbling/annoying experience so far.  Had to change my set up, find new ways of getting tight, and practice benching a lot without any leg drive as well to make sure that I can get power off the chest with less leg drive in case I'm unable to get the same amount of drive I'm used to getting after switching over.  The upshot is that it's revealed some weaknesses that I didn't think I had, though.  Nonetheless, I think my next meet after this one will be in a different fed.  USAPL seems a little strict and un-fun for my tastes... I mean, they apparently check your underwear and don't allow boxers or boxer-briefs?

powerlifting,39iww8,AeonCatalyst,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"I really linked it because he mentions people pulling the bar down, not the grip width. Most of the arm problems from squats is caused by pulling the bar down into your back, which I was doing a year ago and I would be in so much pain I would have to do 2-a-days so I could let me shoulders and elbows relax after squats and then bench ~4 hours later  I grip pretty narrow and just try to keep my arms as relaxed as possible, wrists bend back a lot (like malanichev) but have no pain from it."

powerlifting,39iww8,hyunsyng,2,Fri Jun 12 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"I am also like this, after an intense squat or dead session i am wrecked but the DOMS from squats stays with me for 2-4 days whereas deads i feel fine the next day or am sore for a day tops. I train in the same sort of rep ranges from both exercises (anywhere from 60-85% and high volume)  For what it's worth i dead 40kg over my squat (240 & 200kg) respectively @ 72kg. I also love deadlifting. Squats suck. Maybe it's somewhat mental."
powerlifting,39iww8,rdavis4559,4,Fri Jun 12 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"This is the case for me personally.  Both squat and deadlift workouts will leave me completely wiped out, with no energy left.  However, the amount of DOMS I get after each workout is completely different.  After an intense squat session, I'll be extremely sore for about 2-3 days, then the soreness will be gone completely by the 4th-5th day.  On the other hand, with deadlifts, the soreness is completely gone in 3 days tops.  While I'm not entirely sure why this is the case, I think it may have to do with the range of motion and leverages involved.  While a deadlift will primarily activate your posterior chain with not nearly as much quad activation, depending on the squat style, a squat will more evenly activate all muscles of your legs and posterior chain.  Also,the ROM for the deadlift is much shorter than a deep squat, which may play a factor in this.  This is just speculation, however, so I could just be talking out of my ass."

I am typically fresher on Mondays because it has been 3 days since I squatted, whereas there are only 2 days between Monday and Thursday. Every couple months, I will reverse the order and immediately notice huge differences."

powerlifting,39iww8,mazze01,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:34:56 2015 UTC,Yes. I enjoy the feeling of fatigue I get from deadlifting over squatting. Its funny because I was thinking the same exact thing earlier today.
powerlifting,39iww8,the0rthopaedicsurgeo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"I find deadlift workouts more fun and easier to get through - built to deadlift. Recovering is slightly different tho', DOMS after deadlifts, I compare it to a group of thugs beating my legs and back to purple with steel pipes. Takes longer to recovery from it too.  Squatting feels like a balancing act for me. I have to focus on keeping things in line on the way down so I can push straight up. Soreness isn't that bad afterwards.   It often comes down to your build and technique. Depending on how you utilize your main motor patterns and muscles you will accumulate fatigue. My erectors glutes and hams seem to lock up a lot more after deadlifts (probably due to heavier loads on the eccentric - also deadlift very aggressively compared to methodical squatting) which seems to make me ""most sorerererest"". Squats are little less taxing on my erectors and hams, mostly get sore in quads and glute.   TL;DR - it is different for everyone, I pref deadlifting and better at them yet recover slower. Make sure you keep things in line, just because you feel you can pull 3 times doesn't mean you should."
powerlifting,39iww8,beerybeardybear,0,Wed Jun 17 10:48:18 2015 UTC,"I used to squat 4-7 times a week, usually at 90-95% and I had no fatigue or soreness at any point (only reason I stopped was elbow tendinitis and then unrelated knee issue). I did have to work up to that point over a few weeks though, and I also find using a stationary bike for 5 mins afterwards totally eliminates any DOMS, whereas there's not really a cardio cooldown for your back.  I usually deadlift once every 2 weeks, once a week at most. I stay sore for about 3 days, sometimes more. Deadlifts supposedly tax your CNS more than any other lift, which is why it's usually recommended not to pull really heavy more than once every ~2 weeks."

Sumo is far easier on my lower back; it used to be that when I did conventional my back would ache for days, but with sumo I hardly feel a thing the next day. I also credit sumo for helping me bust through a plateau.  You can still pair up conventional deadlifts as your accessories. On my deadlift days I do sumo as my main and then deficit conventionals as accessories to help with floor speed."
powerlifting,39gufe,oscarian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do hear there's a benefit to programming both, and since I have a pretty dominant squat relative to my other numbers, I think I'll be good at sumo.  Any tips on form, or stretching out the hips to get a good position?"
powerlifting,39gufe,iaccidentlytheworld,3,Fri Jun 12 12:58:01 2015 UTC,"Lol my coach told me ""just get into a position where you're tea bagging the bar.""  But anyway I guess feet placement would be up to each individual, personally I have the insides of my shins just touching the outside of the rings, but I have long legs and even longer arms. Takes a few sessions to get to a position you like.  Before each sumo session I'd wear a resistance band around my thighs and get into a squat position and push my legs outwards to get a good stretch on my adductors. I also do some good mornings with the bar and get a bit of hip flexor stretching done with resistance bands.  During set up, get up as close as possible as you can to the bar and drop your hips down. Ed Coan actually has his shins touching the bar, you can watch his video on sumo pulling somewhere in this sub. Once I drop low enough, I grab the bar and pull myself tight into the bar, sort of ""wedging in"" and locking my lats down tight.  When I pull I mainly focus on 3 things:   When I'm coming up I'm pushing my hips into the bar. I find this stops my lumbar spine from rounding and my hips from shooting up at the start. Translates well into locking my hips out later on as well. I'm snapping my knees locked as fast as I can, and at the same time my hips are extending to lock out. They are not two completely separate movements. If the knees lock out too early before the hips get into position to lock out, you're in for a hard ride trying to do a wide-stance stiff-legged deadlift. My legs are spreading the floor out as much as possible to engage my glutes, puts less strain on the lower back.... Apparently so anyway, I'm still trying to learn that.   Also you want to roll your glutes and your ass with some sort of small hard ball like a lacrosse ball or something. Your glutes are wrecked with sumo, even more so than with conventional.  Everything just clicked for me with sumo actually, I got into position far more comfortably compared to conventional. You never know till you try haha.  Hope that helps and hope there wasn't any misinformation in there! That's just what I've learnt so far from like 4 months of sumo pulling, other more experienced people will probably have more to say!"

powerlifting,39it16,jperras,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:04:17 2015 UTC,"The stiff ones I believe – I actually found them too stiff, like it was a big strip of unflexible fabric. I can pull on the Gangstas while wrapping my wrists, and they stretch a bit, letting me get them just a bit tighter. I'm no world class bench presser (~300lbs), but feeling like I can squeeze as much tightness into my wraps helps with my mental game.  Seriously though, this is picking apart minor details. I'd be happy with either, and maybe if/when my Gangstas fall apart I'll shell out for a pair of SBDs to try them out."

The reactive knee wraps are absolutely fantastic and once they're broken in they're comfortable and get easier to wrap. The Lilliebridge wraps, on the other hand, are like wrapping your knees in plywood. They're so. Fucking. Stiff. However they have amazing rebound and casting/support abilities where the blue wraps are pretty much just decent rebound and super stretchy. The blue slingshot is also good to have because it lets you overload without the slingshot doing too much of the work like the other versions."

Tried a few different companies (EFS, rogue) and their wraps just don't even come close to the quality of slingshot products.  They are a bit more expensive than others but you're getting great quality and customer service to boot.  I've bought a lot of their products over the last couple of years.  I will continue to support them in the forseeable future, as well.  I have a red slingshot that I doubt I'll be replacing any time soon.  I have several pairs of 26"" multi purpose wraps and I love them, never tried gangstas though since my fed doesn't allow 36"" wrist wraps.  The knee sleeves had a problem with the first run but I got a replacement set with no hassle and they feel better quality than the last set I had.  I have no interest in trying another brand of sleeves because I'm so pleased with the slingshot sleeves.  The hip circle is a must for warming up for squats and deads for me, since I do a lot of sitting it's a good way to get the hips firing properly before getting under any weight.  The compression cuffs have been good for me when my elbows are feeling grindy and the quality is much better now than the first pair that I bought.  I don't use them very often but they are comfortable enough.  The only thing I haven't tried is the knee wraps, and I'm very seriously considering getting a set of blues to try out since I'm not a fan of really heavy wraps."
powerlifting,39it16,theNightblade,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:55:51 2015 UTC,Gangsta Wraps: Great for keeping my wrist solid. Makes me feel very comfortable going in for bench/OHP/squat. Purchased mainly for wrist issues during the squat — wrists no longer bother me now.   Compression Cuffs: Bought the 2.0 and they were a little too big so I bought a size smaller of the original. Originally purchased because of elbow/bicep tendonitis during squat (effected my pressing and I was incapable of doing any pulling/back work). Wore it for 1-2 weeks and the pain was still there and kind of got worse. Took them off one day and was able to actually do pull ups (couldn't do more than 3 before elbow tendons felt like they were going to rip). Not sure why these seem like they didn't help. A lot of people I've talked to have the same takeaway with the cuffs.   Hip Circle: I almost always warm up with these for squats/deads. Doing a couple warm up sets for squats with these on really engrain the cueing of the glutes and warms up my lower body. I work a 9-5 office job and drive 2-4 hours a day so I really need to warm myself up before my top sets. This works great. Highly recommend!  Slingshot: My gym has a bunch of these but I've yet to use them. They have a lot of great feedback though.

Mark and crew are just standup people in general and in relation to Slingshot, customer service is amazing.  Slingshots: I own the Reactive and Original Slingshots (Blue and Red)  Speak for themselves obviously, great for overloading of course but also great for pushups and dips. Blue is great for overall uses. Recommend the red for when you get into the 295lb+ range.  Also own Gangsta wraps, Hogan wraps, and Multi-purpose wraps and elbow cuffs. Gangsta wraps are amazing, really lock you in tight and keep your wrists secure. Multi-purpose are just as great and some people even like them better than Gangstas. They're a bit more comfortable so I like to use them on skwaats where I don't need my wrists as strict.  The elbow cuffs, make sure you get the right size because even if you get the blue ones they can dig into your skin pretty tight lol. But they speak for themselves once you stretch em out a bit they scare the tendonitis away.  Also own a Hip circle and knee sleeves. Hip circle is also amazing lol a lot of people aren't receptive to it at first but as soon as you get them in it. They wanna use it every time before they squat and deadlift.  Knee sleeves are similar to Rehbands. Keep you nice and warm and secure. People have been having problems with the stitching but just hit them up with picture proof and they will gladly replace them. Just make sure you get the right size."

powerlifting,39i0id,SnaKiZe,11,Thu Jun 11 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"I prefer to think of it in the broader sense of ""recovering from the peaking cycle"" rather than just recovering from the meet.  I will stay out of the gym for 5-7days and then start the base building cycle over.  It takes me a bit longer these days. I'm over 40."
powerlifting,39i0id,1759,3,Fri Jun 12 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"I will typically take a week off from lifting. Depending on how I feel, I might take a second week off just to be safe."
powerlifting,39i0id,ImHereForFood,3,Fri Jun 12 00:06:41 2015 UTC,It's been almost 2 weeks since my meet and I'm still beat up a bit. I'm back in training and either I've programmed with numbers too high or my body still isn't back to 100% and I'm pushing it too hard.
powerlifting,39i0id,jasopan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:20:40 2015 UTC,Remember to get in one or two light sessions the week immediately following competition to get some blood flow going. That combined with an addition week of rest should be adequately.
powerlifting,39i0id,BenchPolkov,6,Sat Jun 13 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"This is a very individualised thing and depends on a lot of factors like age, training experience, athlete ""level"", etc. A beginner lifter will bounce back and be able to compete more frequently because they literally do not overload their body to the degree an elite lifter would. They are unable to activate their muscles at the same level and due to being able to handle less weight their joints and connective tissues suffer far less strain.  Personally I will be back in training within a week but it might take me a month to be back in full swing. And because of that I have decided to only compete 2-3 a year because the full recovery time from a big comp takes so long."

Generally, everything backslides pretty terribly, then I can recover enough to get back into the swing of things.

powerlifting,39g39y,goochadamg,6,Thu Jun 11 14:14:32 2015 UTC,"So as of last week I finally broke through the 500 lb barrier that has been looming over my deadlift.   Thanks to all of you guys that gave me advice when I posted for help on 485 a few weeks ago.  I've been doing my own routine just basically forcing myself through to higher weights, but I feel like it is time to get with a more proper program, at least for my deadlift.   I've looked at coan/phillipi, mag/ort, and my own program was a 531 variation with more volume  What do you guys think would make sense to run?  For reference I'm 6'3 215ish and am pretty used to higher volume, but not married to it."
powerlifting,39g39y,yoz8ik,5,Thu Jun 11 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"Myself included, I've seen 4 people hit huge PR's using the sample 1 day a week template here:  http://marylandpowerlifting.com/2014/10/14/train-the-deadlift/  I went from 525 to 570, at 242. Buddy #1 went from 635 to 700 at 308 (he ran it previously, but I do not recall his progression). Buddy #2 went from 465 to 515 at 181. Buddy #3 went from 450 to 495, no idea on weight.  Do take note on the assistance work. I personally had a deadlift specific day, which I followed with a few sets of deficit and/or stiff leg. I also didn't do them after squats as mentioned in this article.   As far as I'm concerned, this is the way to train deadlift."
powerlifting,39g39y,goochadamg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:28:24 2015 UTC,How much cycles have you performed to reach this progress?
powerlifting,39g39y,2_Suns,3,Thu Jun 11 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Everyone did 1 cycle, except for the big guy (the 308'r).   Previously, I did a bunch of things for my deadlift. I got to 525 using liner periodization Ed Coan style (http://www.joeskopec.com/coancalc.html); I think I did 2 cycles of this. Prior to that, 5/3/1. Prior to that.. all kinds of stuff.  I've been lifting for a long time, experiencing multiple set backs because of my Ulcerative Colitis. 570 was hit ~7 years of some off and on lifting."
powerlifting,39g39y,goochadamg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:44:23 2015 UTC,So I've only been lifting for 10 months...  Does that change your recomendation?   I will read through this program tonight
powerlifting,39g39y,2_Suns,2,Thu Jun 11 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is to not change a thing if you are progressing. And if you're already deadlifting 500 after 10 months, I'd say you're progressing.   Edit: I snooped your comment history, and it looks like you're making great progress all around. Do not change a god damn thing. After 10 months you've hit something like a 1200 total. That's crazy."
powerlifting,39g39y,BenchPolkov,2,Thu Jun 11 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair I lifted in highschool (10 years ago) and had almost a 1000 total 265 315 405 (985)  So it's not like I started from nothing, just a huge gap in between then and now.  But yea as of last week I'm at 285B, 385S, 500 D (1170)  I didn't do any singles this week, but I broke some old records for triples which felt nice.  I just feel like my programming is a bit random and unstructured.  But you are right, I went from 450 to 500 in only a month, may as well stick with it for now"
powerlifting,39g39y,2_Suns,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:35:01 2015 UTC,I definitely recommend the Mag/Ort cycle if you're only pulling once a week. Personally I think more frequency is more effective now though.

powerlifting,39g39y,Anton_S_Eisenherr,4,Thu Jun 11 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"Ok so right now, among other things I'm training my deadlifts and squats at two rep ranges: both 6s2-3r and 3s5-6r (Hepburn/GZCL/DUP whatever). This ain't broke, and I'd rather not fix it.  Buuuuut, due to time and energy constraints, my upper back, traps and shoulders are getting not enough training, which is limiting my pressing and I fear will eventually screw my deadlift. So, I'm thinking of swapping the medium squat for 3s10-12r overhead squat, as well as the medium deadlift for 3s10-12r snatch grip deadlift.  Is this really dumb and will I loose all my gainz for dropping my tier-2 work, or really smart because I'll get increased hypertrophy, strength off the floor for deadlift and stability in the squat, as well as improving my pressing?"
powerlifting,39g39y,TheAesir,4,Thu Jun 11 14:32:00 2015 UTC,Why not just add some rowing in to hit the upper back?
powerlifting,39g39y,Anton_S_Eisenherr,4,Thu Jun 11 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should mention I do already row: Kroc rows on one day, and barbell on another. I just still feel that everything from waist upwards is weak as shit and it makes overhead and flat pressing feel wobbly and heavy squat attempts terrifying."
powerlifting,39g39y,Teekam,4,Thu Jun 11 14:46:18 2015 UTC,I'd assume you're just not getting enough total volume in then. I'd get in at least two days of barbell or tbar rows where you're hitting at least 5x10
powerlifting,39g39y,Anton_S_Eisenherr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, more rows it is!"
powerlifting,39g39y,guyonthissite,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/TheAesir, but just wanted to add the programming note that there's pretty much no reason to do overhead squats if you're a powerlifter. Crossfit or Oly lifting, maybe, but it's pretty worthless for building your squat. If you were replacing a squat with another squat, it should be a paused, front, or high bar generally. Plus beltless variations of those.   But yes, rows are the answer for your upper back."
powerlifting,39g39y,Anton_S_Eisenherr,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"I'll defer to you and row more; I'm just at the point where I need to I focus so hard on stopping my upper back from slouching that I'm not paying attention to the rest of my body when I squat. It's resulted in me getting into the hole with a nice tight back and my legs are like ""lolwtf am I supposed to do"". Thought that OHS would just strengthen and tighten everything so I'd have to worry about it less."
powerlifting,39g39y,NikhilT90,2,Thu Jun 11 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"If you wanna work your squat and strengthen your upper back, do front squats using the proper clean rack position. Keeping your elbows up puts your upper back through a lot of work. And you can use a heck of a lot more weight than you can for overhead squats, so you'll get a kick ass quad workout, too."

Has anybody transitioned to that style? What was your experience like? Currently working on building a stronger, more stable arch but widening my grip seems to be a tougher process. Is it just time and practice?"
powerlifting,39g39y,Danneborger,4,Thu Jun 11 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"As for the grip, you may want to take your time with widening it to max legal width. One finger at a time, depending on your current width, over a couple of months seems to be fine.  As for the arch, foam rolling thoracic extensions Works well for mobilizing your upper back to arch harder.  Also, this is important to remember in my opinion: A wide grip is potentially more ""dangerous"" for the shoulders than a wide grip, but the higher your arch, the less of an effect on your shoulders due to less rotation."
powerlifting,39g39y,NikhilT90,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Currently my grip is about two fingers width away from the rings, I'd like to at least be able to go to pinkies on the ring. That's an interesting point about the arch carrying over to reducing the risk, I'll keep that in mind. How do you foam roll your thoracic spine? I've been attacking it with a Theracane, I'm hoping that's enough?"
powerlifting,39g39y,BenchPolkov,3,Thu Jun 11 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"Well if your competition is in fall going max width by then shouldn't be a problem.  I simply lie on a foamroller and start just under my neck, top of my upper back. Then I lean back into the foam roller and try to press myself into it, extending my upper back as hard as I can. Using your own bodyweight, you should be able to get a nice feeling of extension. It can be slightly uncomfortable, but you know you're done stretching a specific area once that feeling is gone and it's nice and loose. I'm 260 lbs., so I don't know if I have an easier time using a foam roller for this than a lighter person."
powerlifting,39g39y,Danneborger,2,Thu Jun 11 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"/u/NikhilT90  Doing this over the back of a barbell in the bench rack on the floor is a more extreme and slight more effective version of this as well. And this is if and only if you need more stretch, hold a plate, kettlebell, etc, in your hands with your arms extended behind your head (like a pullover) or get someone to push down on your hands. When you feel stretching in your abs and ribcage you know its working."

powerlifting,39g39y,greenalleycat,3,Thu Jun 11 22:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to repeat a few things that /u/Danneborger has already said but I'll add my 2c too.  The ideal wide-grip arched bench is basically a decline bench. Your ribcage should be angled up, your scaps and shoulder set back and at lockout you should be thinking of turning your thumbs inwards towards your toes (if that makes any sense). As you slowly progress to this set you should be making sure your shoulders stay back all through the rep and do not extend forward at lockout and that your chest is thrust towards the bar for the entire time also. You are only trying to lockout your triceps, not push your shoulders forward. This does two things:   Reduces ROM - unrack the bar in an arched set up and contract your lats and set your shoulders back. The bar should visibly lower. Now if you do this while extending your chest towards the bar and maintain this for the whole rep then your ROM will be reduced. Protects shoulders - extending your shoulders forward under heavy weight can be dangerous. Let your pecs and triceps be the major drivers. Save your delicate shoulders.   To help maintain the arch do a lot of hip and quad stretching before you lift so you can get your feet as far back towards your butt as possible and maintain tension, and in particular, maintain that raised chest. If your chest slumps you'll quickly discover the lift gets harder. Now heels down or heels up if your prerogative but I personally think that heels down is a far more powerful setup, but heels up is easier."

Now (June 2015), (I just started squatting again 2 months ago) and I squat 315x8 and deadlift 365x3 at the bodyweight of 155. video of 315x5 squat. 350x5 deadlift.  Basically, I think it's weird that my deadlift is probably about the same as my squat. I did recently start accutane, a really strong acne medicine, which makes your joints ache. I don't have much aching, but when I deadlift and squat my lower back does feel tight.  Could anybody help me get my deadlift stronger? My thoughts:  -My leverages could have changed with the weight gain  -my form could may not be optimal  -I'm very weak off the floor  -My lower back could be a weak point  Tldr; Added ~100 pounds to squat and deadlift is the same."

powerlifting,39g39y,coffeecupschooner,3,Thu Jun 11 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I should stop my bulk or keep gaining .. I've been bulking since last July and I gained almost 10kg.. I would like to keep it up but my lifts have stalled , my appetite is shit and my BF% is not summer ready.. I'm also 5'7"" / 165 so cutting is not optimal yet..      TLDR: FML , I'm fluffy and small."
powerlifting,39g39y,coffeecupschooner,5,Thu Jun 11 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"Two ways to look at it, you can either stay small and cut, or you can continue slowly bulking until you're big, and then cut. It looks like you were adding 2lbs a month, try cutting that in half and see if that doesn't lower the amount of bodyfat you gain.  As far as your lifts go, what are you numbers that you're stalling at? and what does your training look like?"

powerlifting,39fret,OmnipotentStudent,3,Thu Jun 11 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'm currently being coached by Bryce as a full time athlete. That means weekly check ins with videos I've taken, as well as I email him/fb him pretty much every other day with random questions.  The way TSA works, from my knowledge, is that they give you a random coach. You can say who you prefer and I'm sure if they're availalbe they'll let you be coached by that person, but it is 100% their choice.   I'm aiming for around 10-12.5kg pr on my squat, 7.5-10kg pr on my bench, and 12.5-17.5kg pr on my deadlift... at the same bodyweight... over the course of a 16 week cycle. It's also important to mention I have a severe shoulder injury, and walked in with a minor hip injury. So we were able to work around those and still am looking for big PRs!  I'm coached by Bryce and he's been extremely acommodating. We discussed not increasing my bw, and instead actually doing a minicut, because I personally am uncomfortable with being a piggy.   Awesome crew, I'm 99% I'm going to stick with him."
powerlifting,39fret,OmnipotentStudent,2,Fri Jun 12 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply man, I've been looking at online coaching options for months now and Bryce had always been a forerunner. Glad to have my belief in his proficiency as a coach confirmed   Would you recommend the weekly coaching over a consult? I realise it's more expensive, so I may have to save haha (poor student checking in)"
powerlifting,39fret,OmnipotentStudent,2,Fri Jun 12 07:48:52 2015 UTC,"I never did the consultation exclusively.   So far the weekly coaching has been superb and would highly recommend it. IIRC I paid $500 some in separate payments over the course of the 16 weeks.   He managed my macros, listened to personal goals/issues/injuries, programmed according to my lifestyle. He also took the time to explain WHY we were doing things. A lot of the stuff we do goes over my head in terms of programming as I was used to much simpler stuff, but he made a long video explaining everything.   And yes, Bryce was also my first choice. I have to say I may not have chosen TSA if I did not get Bryce. I'm not 100% sure about the other coach's programming abilities/lifting style/personal life/etc. Not to say they aren't bad, Hani coaches Gerrit Blevins, I just don't know them as well."

I did TEN sets of three with 110kg on Friday.   Some people excel at reps, others at work capacity across a whole workout, others at max effort.   2 cents from a novice though"

powerlifting,39i28t,Beanies,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:08:38 2015 UTC,"The Prilepin's Chart is a good place to start, but I disagree with a lot of the recommendations. Keep in mind these were for olympic weightlifting which has eccentric-less movements and professional Oly lifters are most certainly using drugs, training 2x per day, 6-7 days a week.   I would start on the low end of the recommendations and see how you feel over the period of 6 months to a year. After that evaluate your training and see what volumes/intensities worked best for you. Personally I would much rather work at the lowest intensity/volume possible to make progress and stay injury free then push my limits each workout.  Also keep in mind that the chart does not take into account stress from what you've already done. So while it may say 18 reps is optimal at a certain percent range, what if you have already done 18 in another lift or variation? This is where a bit of autoregulation needs to come into play."

I've been eyeing their knee sleeves for a few months now, but not sure what size to get. My knee circumference is 43cm, debating if I should stay with the xl (40-43 cm) or drop to the larges(37-40 cm) for a tighter fit"
powerlifting,39ccly,abductedabdul,6,Wed Jun 10 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"I love the knee sleeves but here's my problem with them. First pair I got I went for the size under, like the site insists, and they ripped at the seams after about five uses. After an email to customer service I got a free pair to replace them while going for the same size (M). While they were still in the ziplock bags they were stolen from my car - along with the rest of my gym gear/bag. So...I ponied up the money to buy another pair which after ONE use one of them ripped at the seams again.  Aside from that, my experience with them are nice considering the price but if I do get another pair from them I would go for the size that fits my leg. I hesitate on that though because of this ripping happening again since it doesn't take much. Also, I'm afraid of getting the ideal size (L) because they might not feel tight after they fill with sweat. The mediums when sweaty are very pliable making it easier to take off. If none of that helps I would ultimately say that the customer service was outstanding so if this does happen to you don't be afraid to exchange them (just provide pictures for proof).   Edit: I would probably wait until they develop later generations to fix the stitching before I get another SlingShot knee sleeve."

powerlifting,39ccly,allrushmixxtape,4,Thu Jun 11 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"In terms of assistance from least to most it goes Reactive < Original < Full boar < Maddog  General recommendations based off of your raw BP Max:  <315: Reactive 315-405: Original 405-500: Full Boar 500+: Maddog  I personally use the Original with a raw BP max of 390 (Slingshot max of 430). I don't put on the slingshot until at least 300 lbs is on the bar, I believe with the original if there's <275 lbs on the bar it will be hard to even get it to your chest. Scale these #'s down for reactive, and up for the other two."

powerlifting,39ccly,Itlan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:57:19 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm a firm believer that it's helpful for basically anyone at near any strength level. Getting more reps in at 90-100% of your max is helpful.
powerlifting,39ccly,gzcl,2,Fri Jun 12 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"The higher the level, the more ""spring"" it gives you, so the more weight you'll be able to handle with it. No experience with one, but everyone who have used them has loved them"

powerlifting,39ccly,AeonCatalyst,3,Thu Jun 11 12:29:04 2015 UTC,each slingshot has sizes (Med through 3XL) so it could be that the other ones were oversized for you.

Off the top of my head, some of the advantages:   Overload work, improving lockout As opposed to board press, floor press, or some others that help lockout, Slingshot BP helps you ingrain the movement pattern as the whole movement will be almost identical to your raw benching Mentally, getting ""used to"" having heavier weights in your hands. There's seldom better feelings than hitting your raw BP max for a 3x3"

powerlifting,39a7a9,entropydecreaser,2,Wed Jun 10 14:40:17 2015 UTC,I don't think it's broken. That barely got a reaction out of him and it hit his foot on like the second or third bounce so the force was just a little bit more than just putting about 150 kgs on it.

Shame to see Candito come so close and miss it on the record attempt. Though for sure he had it with his training vids.  Why doesn't he train with an eleiko comp bar?
powerlifting,39a7a9,jimmyblizzle,6,Wed Jun 10 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"The IPF lists Eleiko, Ivanko, Leoko, Pallini, Uesaka and Titex bars as all being approved for competition use (see link below). However, I believe that on the world stage they tend to use the Eleiko bars as they are seen to be the best quality. As Candito trains in a commerical gym, I assume his bar selection is fairly limited  http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/fileadmin/data/Technical_Rules/IPFV3.1_final_Approved_List_01.01.2015.pdf  In any case, it's a pretty crappy reason for him to miss the lift! He clearly had the strength there. I think he deserves massive credit for pulling 633 with a grip much wider than what he had been training"

Or is teaching good form enough to keep the injury rate at acceptable levels?  One of the things I noticed in Greg's excellent write-up is that it seems powerlifters have a higher risk of shoulder injury compared to other strength sports. Even though the research is still a little tentative, and the studies cited here focus on competitive/experienced athletes, do you feel like this is enough of a problem to recommend a targeted prevention program?   (Anecdotal source: 8 weeks in to SL 5x5 I failed a couple of OHP sets and my shoulder's been hurting since then. Booo).    Input from /u/gnuckols especially appreciated, since this is his baby."

powerlifting,399tgf,gnuckols,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"Greg, what is your view on the role of over head pressing to build the bench press (as opposed to for general strength training)? I see some people, Mike Tuchscherer for instance, who don't seem to emphasize it in their programming while others, Rip and Wendler etc, value it highly. For powerlifting purposes, is my time better spent on the bench or does the press play an important role (ie ""fixing specific muscular weaknesses"" in the off season)?  Thank you so much for this fantastic article and all of your other work! Your advice has single handedly transformed my deadlift and also facilitated serious improvements to my bench"
powerlifting,399tgf,guacamoli123,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think it depends what your weakness is.  If your bench is limited by weak shoulders, obviously it would be a good option (or incline press).  I also think that, in general, pressing options that allow the scapula to move freely will be more shoulder friendly in the long run (also including dips, and pushups) as long as your shoulders can tolerate them initially.  But in terms of direct transfer, nothing beats the bench itself so it should be the vast majority of your pressing in meet prep, especially for more advanced lifters"

So far it has been very tough as it's very high volume (think sheiko but tougher), but I've seen great progression on all of my lifts.  You give him your numbers and what your goals are and he sends you a template for the numbers you want to hit.  He told me he goes by feel and you dont exactly have to follow those numbers, but it's a good baseline to go off by.  Price wise, it was $200 for a 8 week training program plus an additional $50 if you want him to give you a diet plan.

Basically the program starts with high reps, low volume and then it begins to accumulate every week.  Then it transitions into higher volume and intensity as the rep scheme remains. Here's an example of week 4 for my working sets for deadlift:  2 SETS 10-12 REPS, 2 SETS 8-10 REPS, 2-4 SETS 8-10 REPS,  It was definitely tough for my body to get use to the volume even though I've ran through Sheiko, but eventually adjusted and my form for all my lifts have improved just from the higher reps."

powerlifting,39cvc8,tjtoste,3,Thu Jun 11 16:22:36 2015 UTC,He told me what he does is do T&G the first 4 weeks and then dead stop the last 4 weeks for deadlifts.

My bench hasn't been progressing as I would like, but I would contribute that to the shoulder injury I had before I started this program.  The main difference I've notice is my form is a lot better and still improving and my body can handle more volume.  Here's my maxes before I started: Squat: 415 Bench: 225 Deadlift: 500  I can update this after I max if you would like."

Heres the result of a mock meet in the gym:   Squat: 410 -> 435 Bench: 225 -> 245 Deadlift: 500 -> 510  I was happy with my squat and bench but a little disappointed with my deadlift.  I don't think it was a programming issue but my body was exhausted at that point.  I was happy with the results regardless!  I'm currently running the program again.

I am not saying you for sure have diabetes, but from what you told us, it does raise a red flag.

powerlifting,39b4dk,MasteronAndCommander,15,Wed Jun 10 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"I have used it with success. The only issue I ever see is poor implementation in the part of the lifter. Once it is understood that max effort isn't always a variation for a single and dynamic effort isn't always 40-60% for 12 sets of 2, among several other grossly misunderstood variables, then it can lead to success for just about anyone.

They've got three videos out so far specifically on programming with only dynamic upper left to go (but it's fairly easy to extrapolate based on their other videos and general information online).  The big key is to tailor the movements to your weak points.  I'm on my second week of conjugate and I'm enjoying it quite a bit so far.

powerlifting,39b4dk,TheAesir,3,Wed Jun 10 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree whole-heartedly with this. Most of the complaints levied against the conjugate system I find are complaints levied against exercise selection for geared lifters. Classic strawman argument would be as follows: ""westside sucks for raw lifting. One rep max chain suspended good mornings and high box squats aren't going to build your raw squat"". The argument in a vacuum is one I'd agree with, but it completely glosses over what a conjugate system is and throws the baby out with the bath water. I can't imagine not getting stronger in my competition stance if I PR my high bar, ATG squat, for example."
powerlifting,39b4dk,TheAesir,2,Wed Jun 10 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Also the percentages for DE are too low   No, this is flat out wrong. Those that don't understand Westside believe this. The percentages are based off a competition peaked max in gear, and are generally performed raw or in briefs (for squat).   Lets look at an example lifter, he has a raw max bench of 500lbs and a multiply bench of 650lbs. His dynamic effort work would be performed at 390lbs which is roughly 78% of his raw max. Dynamic work should be done in the 70-80% range for raw lifters, just like one would be doing in the majority of say a typical Sheiko program."
powerlifting,39b4dk,Fiarwire,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"Westside is the most common of the western conjugate systems, and your points in your previous post are common arguments against it.

There will be less reliance on bands and chains, and more reliance on lift variations (SS bar squats, high bar squats, comp squat, paused squats) that focus on your weak points.  The other thing to keep in mind when programming dynamic effort work, is that the traditional speed day is 60-70% of a comp max (see speed work is done in no equipment, or just briefs for squat) so it needs to be adjusted up to the 70-80% range to accommodate for the discrepancies between a multi-ply and raw max."

Assuming you're max lower day is Saturday for simplicity:  3 weeks out: circa max 1.  Most important peaking day.  Micro mini reverse band, no box for raw lifters.

If something isn't working you have to figure out why it's not working. Get help from someone experienced or do a lot of reading and searching for answers. There are just too many variables for me to know exactly why these injuries happened, at it's probably (most likely) not your age. You don't get hurt just because you turned 35, but your age could be affecting your recovery. Maybe you're training too frequently; maybe you should spend less time 90%> range and stay more in the 70-85% range and then peak at the end of a cycle or 2, or 3. Maybe you need more variety in your lifts, your broken metatarsal could be an overuse injury. I don't know, but you have to look at your history and find out.  But no successful lifter is without injuries, it's part of the game and many have a much longer list than you. If this is something you want to be doing, make it work. This means changing your approach when things stop working. This goes for any stage of any lifter's career."

There are people over 80 years old doing powerlifting. The problem with large injuries is that when you get one your body usually never heals back to what it was before the injury. Bones heal completely, but most other tissues become replaced with scar tissue.  Injuries usually occur during max attempts training with improper technique. If you study to get correct technique and try to minimize the times you lift until failure, you should be good. People tend to lift with their ego and not their brain."
powerlifting,398qtv,2bananasforbreakfast,6,Wed Jun 10 03:49:15 2015 UTC,People tend to lift with their ego and not their brain.   I must remember that one.
powerlifting,398qtv,RudyKalman,4,Wed Jun 10 09:05:56 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Injury rate decreased drastically when I stopped lifting with my ego. Even injuries I assumed were permanent have been getting better.
powerlifting,398qtv,JohnTesh,2,Wed Jun 10 13:39:17 2015 UTC,I'm breaking down at 20
powerlifting,398qtv,Maxxxz1994,6,Wed Jun 10 10:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'm 43 and have a 1200+ total.   I don't have the kind of injuries you have... I can't say whether you're training poorly or you don't have the lifelong foundation to be training the way you're training, but you should probably investigate that.  I'll be honest, though: I have no idea how I'll be training when I'm 55 or 60. I'm training for strength and long-term health and vitality, and there's no a lot of info out there for guys like me thinking in terms of the 10 year plan. I work out in a pretty amazing gym, with nationally competitive lifters, so I can see what the older body is capable of, but I'm not inclined to gain excess mass or risk tearing the body apart for records.  But between now and 50? I see my lifts going up and my weight staying pretty much the same. As long as my waist stays at the 30.5"" measurement it's at now, and I can do some medium runs, I figure everything I want is still in range."
powerlifting,398qtv,jason_lifts,4,Wed Jun 10 04:54:15 2015 UTC,Yeah thanks me too. The first year was full of them sweet gains.
powerlifting,398qtv,liftingluieee,3,Wed Jun 10 02:10:34 2015 UTC,I wonder if there is any difference between those who started young (let's say teens) and kept lifting into their old age vs those who started at an older age (let's say 30+)
powerlifting,398qtv,rdavis4559,6,Wed Jun 10 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"both have ""training ages.""  all other things being equal, including consistency, programming, and recovery, the younger lifter has the potential for a longer maximum training age to accumulate.  one thing that is not always equal aside from genetics is mentality.   if you start believing that you are old at 35 you might end up feeling that much old, that much more prone to injury, and having that much less to work with to achieve your goals.   you're young.  sure, I started at age 26 and wish I had started at 14 but I see people older than me who started at much later points in their lives and I see many older lifters who started at a younger age than myself and who have been competing longer than I've been alive yet I'm still pushing more weight than the two aforementioned types of lifters.  just don't sell yourself short and keep training.  muscle wasting is deterred more by resistance training into old, old ages than anything else so just keep up the lifestyle.  one of my top training buddies is turning 80 this year.  I just got him back into deadlifting, front squats, and some dumbbell work not a week goes by the he doesn't thank me and express how happy he is and how much he missed this stuff."
powerlifting,398qtv,always_gone,3,Wed Jun 10 03:01:52 2015 UTC,"My dad's turning 68 this year and ran 5 marathons last year, 3 of them in 2 weeks. He's been the ""silver fox,"" as the moms in the carpool line used to say, since he was 45 (literally totally grey at 40) and that's the only thing that hints at his age. He's always looked way younger, even now after some seriously traumatic shit, he still looks like he's in his 50's.  I'm going to attribute a lot of this to having built insane work capacity over the course of his life and enjoying it, not dreading it (I shit you not he took a two week vacation in 2012, that was the first vacation that was more than just a long weekend since he was 14).  TL;DR  Mentality has a lot to do with it, Chris Duffin recently said something about needing to be mentally, emotionally, and physically strong if you want to be a pillar of strength. So yeah, you're 35, that's not fucking old."

powerlifting,398qtv,HaughtPockets,7,Wed Jun 10 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"FWIW OP, I know 17 year olds with those same injuries. Yes, the older you get, the less you're able to recover as quickly, but you also hopefully have some wisdom which will allow you to train optimally vs if you started at 20.   That said, consider TRT"
powerlifting,398qtv,dfmtr,5,Wed Jun 10 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I know, bro. I'm 37, just three years into the sport, and already wondering if I should quit. What pisses me off is that I've lost all faith in my body's ability to degrade gracefully. Warmed up, not fatigued, solid form, light weight, and something just breaks without any warning.  I tore a hamstring squatting 70% of my max, and after the whole damn year it took to heal, I promptly tore an adductor with 90% of what I'd lifted two days before. I have no confidence left that I won't eat a barbell benching 135 or that my spine won't snap in two halfway during my next deadlift warmup. I'm pretty depressed about it, because my motivation goes to shit without actual competitive goals, but at this rate I may be headed for more serious life-long consequences if I keep pushing ahead."
powerlifting,398qtv,dwanga,2,Wed Jun 10 05:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm 34 and into my second year of lifting. I am always very careful with any movement, either compound or isolated. Any day when I can get out of the gym without a strain or sprain, I am very happy and grateful. As you know it takes much longer to heal than when you were 20. Due to the nature of my work and clientele, I can tell you individual anatomy and exercise performance vary greatly. Some people injure frequently and are slow to heal, while the opposite can be just as common.   Listen to your body. You know your body than anyone else, and always use protection: warmup, brace, belt (when lifting heavy) and perfect your form."
powerlifting,398qtv,OmnipotentStudent,3,Wed Jun 10 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"IMO it depends on how balls to the wall you're going.   My previous coach took it easy-ish most of the time and he's in his late 50s and hoping to pull ~240kgs at 74 raw.   He had a shoulder injury around your age when he was training with juicers as a natural (read overtraining/underrecovering).   Other than that, just a minor back injury."

powerlifting,398qtv,gdblu,3,Wed Jun 10 06:54:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of older lifters have 10, 15, 20+ years of experience behind them so their muscle density, connective tissue and strength base are already well developed and might not understand the difference between them and someone who started out older.  I started lifting right before I turn w d 36 and have been at it 2.5 years now (38).  Within the first year i, with proper form, developed osteoarthritis in my left shoulder that damaged my AC joint and deteriorated my clavicle to the point that I haven't been able to do any sort of chest work since 2013. I feel it creeping into my right shoulder, too...   I also have recurring hip/back issues from a car wreck I was in 21 years ago and son r times, even with proper form (perfect affix opp riding to some pros), it rears it's ugly head in on occasion in the middle of a rep and that will set me back a couple weeks at a time.  Because we don't have that skeletal/muscular experience like someone who's been lifting since they were 16, I think we're more prone to aches and breaks.  I'm doing my first competition in 2 weeks but, at this rate, I'm already wondering how much I have left in me."

But, I'm looking to maybe do Jacked&Tan (I do tan well :-).  I've only had injury to my ego.  I have had to restart my squat as I discovered I was not getting past parallel (just recently started to video myself), so now I have to focus on ATG which I am getting, but at lighter weights than previous.  Otherwise, it's been DOMS only for the hurts.  I have trouble with form on lighter weights, but when I start getting up to and over 2 plates, my form locks in.  Don't know why that works that way, but I almost hate warmups.  Oh, I did have forearm tendinitis from squats, but a wrist wrap has solved that issue.  At my age, I do have lower back issues, but surprisingly, squats and deadlifts have strengthened my lower back to where I don't have the problems of the past.  I do wear a belt for both squats and deadlifts.  I've never tested my maxes, but I'm reasonably certain I can pull 300+ from the floor - conventional.  I went to the expense of setting up a home gym with a Rogue SML-2 squat rack, Ohio bar, and bumpers, plus some other stuff.  The only thing I fear is not lifting."

powerlifting,396io0,Roevhaal,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. Tbh I feel like there should be some changes towards rules regarding grip width. There should be some rule saying how wide you can grip the bar according to your height. Just my opinion."
powerlifting,396io0,CasualPotato,2,Tue Jun 9 20:49:01 2015 UTC,According to height or arm length?  If you say there is a set grip width allowed based on certain arm lengths then the rule would basically be a set maximum angle that is allow at the shoulder joint.   Increasing the width allowed for a set arm length would increase allowed angle.  Keeping the width the same but increasing required arm length would decrease the allowed angle for example.  Arm length is the hypotenuse and length hand to shoulder is essentially the adjacent side of a triangle. The angle between them would have to be within a set range.  Obviously judges aren't measuring lifter angles but based on arm length a quick calculation could then determine maximum allowed grip width for that lifter.  It would be a lot of work to decide upon what is and isn't allowed and to validate why a set max angle is chosen but I do think something needs to be changed.
powerlifting,396io0,johnfarrellfitness,0,Wed Jun 10 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes it was something along this line I had in mind, and you're right that it should be based on arm length."

powerlifting,396io0,CasualPotato,2,Tue Jun 9 21:05:15 2015 UTC,Ok and then the heavier weight classes that have people with long arms will practically have to do close grip even though even if they bench with max width the rom is significant.
powerlifting,396io0,VladYev,0,Tue Jun 9 22:58:40 2015 UTC,So you want people with long arms to do wide grip deadlifts also? How do you suggest to punish people with short femurs in the squat then?

powerlifting,396io0,Lobsterzilla,2,Tue Jun 9 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"Quick question about benching with a big arch. When it comes to touching the bar to you and the pause, is there a specific cut off point for where the bar can land and no lower?  For example, when I bench I aim to touch the bar to my xiphoid process as that's about as low down on my chest that I feel comfortable touching.  From this vid it looks like he touches the bar to the middle yellow dot on his suit which looks to be a decent ways below his chest.  Not hating on his lift what so ever, shit, just holding that kind of weight in the bench would have me in trouble.  But yeah, just want to know if there is a rule or specific point I should be aiming/aware of."
powerlifting,396io0,dannnyds,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:14:15 2015 UTC,The old rules was that  the bar couldn't touch below the chest bone. New rules is that you can touch both chest and  stomach and get a good lift. You can't go as low as touching the belt if you use one though.
powerlifting,396io0,dannnyds,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:57:39 2015 UTC,"So I could (do) use a belt and touch halfway down my body (assuming a stupid big arch) and be ok?  Well, cool I guess, but I'm gonna keep benching the way I do just the same :)"

There's national on July 19 but idk how much stronger I can get in only 6 weeks   Realistically in as short as 6 weeks ~5% or so on your PR's is possible...... ~10% would be incredible, but not entirely out of the question. Realistically I would expect something just short of 5% or so on top of your pr's by that point if you keep your attendance at the gym 100%.   Am I still a beginner   Answering this question is kind of subjective. At your age and body weight I would say you're definitely advanced compared to your peers, but as far as older lifters....definitely less experienced.    Or should I do that Intermediate Deadlift Program again, Jonnie Canditos's 6 week program, or 5/3/1. Or am I not advanced enough for any of those programs?    When I was first starting off I was a bean pole myself. I've almsot doubled my weight since then, but thats another story. So since I've experienced what it was like to be a skinny lifter....and a fat one... I can speak a little to this.  When I was skinny, the best program for me was much less reps and much higher weight. I did something very similar to the 5/3/1 program in reverse (2/4/6) and it worked very very well. I did this in the ~80-95% of 1 RM range (obviously usually with a  spotter). The interesting thing is that, although there is some debate for this, if you go over to the bodybuilding cliques they'll say that the low rep high weight routines are perfect for bodybuilding when you're skinny. Its also perfect for strength. So you'd be getting something of a double whammy with that.    Squat   Squat has been something of my white whale, I've spent years perfecting it and training really hard on it. Basically legs are my weakpoint. I'm still not very good at it as far as strength goes (315  is the most I've tried 1 Rep Max, but ass to grass style iwth a now shitty pair of knees). Point is that I can coach squat, even though for me its my strength in my legs is kind of mediocre.  If I were you (or talking to my past self), I would really really really focus on developing your hip strength...big time. Squat is a big compound move, and I like to make the imperfect analogy that any compound move (squat, bench w/e) is only as strong as the weakest muscle in that group.   For developing hip strength I would do w/e routine you want, but add in maybe one or two exercises of the following:  full range of motion squats, as in your ass touches your heels (or come as close as you can). This will feel very weird (and humbling) at first because you'll have to tone down the weight a bit (or a lot if you're me). At the bottom really focus on squeezing your glutes powerfully. At first they might be so weak you don't even feel anything because there is close to literally no muscle or control over them. After a few weeks or so of this you'll start to feel the difference in your hips, and the cool thing about it is that it takes some pressure off your knees to have strong hips and thus reduces potential for knee injury.   full range of motion leg presses* Basically the same principles apply here. You'll have to lower the weight, and then at the bottom especially focus on squeezing those glutes.    As a side note, I've felt that the best training secret out there, better than any program you can possibly think of... Is simply attendance. 100% attendance or close to it is probably the most important component to success of any program. After that its methodology, then finally what you do outside the gym (like sleep habits, eating and so on). Of course thats my opinion, but I think it makes sense.   Anyways good on you man, keep it up. By the end of high school you should be a mf beast."

powerlifting,39448x,nimbleal,6,Tue Jun 9 03:31:45 2015 UTC,Kind of goes back to that Coan/Lilliebridge ideology of never one-rep maxing in the gym so it will arguably always look as though they have a little more in the tank.
powerlifting,39448x,rdavis4559,16,Tue Jun 9 04:15:33 2015 UTC,But Lilliebridge goes for one-rep maxes in the gym quite frequently...

powerlifting,39448x,rdavis4559,10,Tue Jun 9 12:53:30 2015 UTC,no he hits gym prs on a way more frequent basis than other lifters. lilliebridge ideology is pretty far away from coan's
powerlifting,39448x,koolaidman123,-4,Tue Jun 9 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"I've been on a high intensity, high frequency program for 17 weeks now and I have not taken a single day off from training albeit I took a five day routine and split it out into seven days.  I hit new 1RM back squat PRs on a weekly basis, not to mention front squat 3RMs and back squat 2RMs, the latter on a weekly basis and the former usually on a bi-monthly basis.  My point in telling you this is that just like Eric, I'm using a training max, not a true physical max.  I haven't failed a single squat rep in this seventeen weeks and always leave 5-15lbs in reserve.  Go on Instagram and ask Eric how often he fails attempts while training in the gym; he'll respond to you.  The answer will be hardly ever.  It is true that the LBTM differs from Coan's program but the Lilliebridges as well as Dan Green adopted other ideologies piecemeal from Ed, some of those being a lot of the same assistance movements and also the notion of keeping lifts clean, staying away from long, slow, grinding reps and trying as best you can to never fail in gym training."
powerlifting,39448x,rdavis4559,11,Tue Jun 9 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"except ed never hit gym prs above his meet prs (with exception of his 901x2 deadlift) and doesn't recommend singles, and suggests a lot more volume at moderate intensity range, not to mention saving prs for the platform. compare that to the lilliebridges, especially eric, who has posted numbers above his meet pr multiple times in all the lifts, rarely does reps more than singles, and you're maxing out every time you're in the gym."
powerlifting,39448x,koolaidman123,-1,Tue Jun 9 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"A few notes from the LBTM pdf as well as Eric's separate cycle documents, all of which I purchased out of curiousity ~6 months ago:  LBTM  The heavy lift of each week typically has you work up to a top set within which you are hitting a 1RM percentage-based AMRAP set:  > ""Have fun with this and push yourself to the limit on the max rep sets for all the lifts. They are called max rep sets because you are supposed to max on the reps until you have nothing left in you.""  Peaking weeks have you working singles up to a percentage-based single similar to this:  • Set 1 - 80% single  • Set 2 - 87% single  • Set 3 - 93% single  Nowhere is it prescribed to hit a single above 96% until your new 1RM test or competition.   ""Front squats - Go by how you feel. If you want to push it, then do so. Just don’t max out. ""  ""Week 9: If you aren’t competing, then this is your max out week. Hit a big PR! Week 10: If you are competing, rest the entire week. No lifting at all.""   Eric Lilliebridge's Programs   ""After your last heavy week, you will test your 1 rep max either in the gym or at a competition!""   Eric's program is very similar to the existing LBTM but I see some top sets prescribed at 97% but only during peaking in Week 11.  So the video that initiated this conversation?  Let's assume Eric is putting forth 90-96% there, he obviously has more left in him."

They are called max rep sets because you are supposed to max on the reps until you have nothing left in you.""   and where exactly does ed coan's philosophy of working within 5-2 rep range, working backwards and pre-planning numbers/reps/sets fit with that?   show me one video of ed coan hitting a squat pr with singles within his meet prep and then couldn't do it in competition and i'll admit i'm wrong."
powerlifting,39448x,turinturambar81,0,Tue Jun 9 21:09:45 2015 UTC,did I not say some ideologies and assistance selection?  did I saw that they held identical ideologies?  I stated that both believed in not maxing out 1rm attempts outside of competitions.
powerlifting,39448x,rdavis4559,0,Tue Jun 9 22:30:17 2015 UTC,"That's debatable. I've not seen a video where I was convinced he couldn't have squatted +5 lbs or more than he did. Whereas he has missed attempts at meets, not always strictly related to the weight.  Deadlift, on the other hand...his program is built around nothing but singles, and some of them are maxed out or extremely close, though less so ever since he hit 900, which seemed to be more of a personal goal than a meet prep strategy because he hasn't been anywhere close to that in a meet."
powerlifting,39448x,chuckechaps,2,Tue Jun 9 08:17:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  He goes for training maxes but not true physical maxes.  As for deadlift, any times that I've seen him fail a deadlift has been either due to decreased performance  from illness or from grip."

powerlifting,3959ex,ghostintheshell12,3,Tue Jun 9 10:19:21 2015 UTC,"I've experienced a few similar problems.   The most effective step I took was picking up a pair of Romaleos. They come with two different insoles, one softer (training) and one harder (comp). They are expensive, I paid 200 AUD for mine. However, they are fantastic and I've heard they are significant step up on the Adidas powerlifts (which have more give in the sole). If you are looking to pay less I would recommend Do-wins over the powerlifts, the former have a wooden sole compared to the latter's rubber. Also, expect a 2-3 month period for your squat to get back to where it was in flats; oly shoes entirely alter your leverages (assuming you are a relatively advanced lifter)  Personally I was having issues typical of poor ankle mobility, but with no apparent mobility issues. Ie I was pushing through my toes and coming forward out of the hole BUT I had no real flexibility issues. I went to a physio and he attributed this to 'flat' feet and ultra tight calves. Try doing some basic calf stretches and foam rolling and see if it makes a difference  A little patented trick of mine that also helped me is the 'banded calf raise' (no idea if I actually invented this but it seems unlikely). I  tie a band to something on the ground, put the other side around my neck and perform traditional standing calf raises on a raised surface through a full range of motion. Over a month or two the range of motion has increased and my calves aren't tight at all! BUT before you get your hopes up --> my calves haven't grown, not even a bit :p   Good luck mate!!"

powerlifting,392os8,ceejayess,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:53:16 2015 UTC,I'm doing the same and getting great results. I've gone from 105 to 125 (kg) bench in 2 months while cutting. Would definitely recommend
powerlifting,392os8,drewjy,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:18:47 2015 UTC,Impressive. What's your bench at?
powerlifting,392os8,Benxbec,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:42:45 2015 UTC,Hit 255 for a grindy but solid single last Friday. To be fully honest I've also brought my grip out about an inch and a half and improved leg drive too but I also can't say that's not a result of three hard bench sessions a week.  Was that a triple negative?
powerlifting,392os8,stevethresh,3,Tue Jun 9 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"I'll preface my comment with a little background. I'm a 32 year old male who was sedentary for pretty much 28 years and picked up the barbell for the first time in January 2013. Program hopped here and there. No desire to compete just trying to get stronger. Running the intermediate 1x/week for bench, ohp, squat, and DL on four separate days (similar to 531) and I've never felt stronger. I have also learned that you do not know ""leg day"" until you've followed Greg's squat template. Highly recommend, the man is a prodigy.  My current 1rms at 205bw are ohp 127.5, dl 335, bench 185, squat 275.all in pounds."
powerlifting,392os8,sullen13,2,Tue Jun 9 01:44:16 2015 UTC,I ran some of the sample routines from his free spreadsheet and I think it was beneficial. I didn't test my lifts afterwards but I definitely think I gained strength.
powerlifting,392os8,zobger,2,Tue Jun 9 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"Currently running average to savage (just started the final block). So far my squat is going up well (190kg x 3 -> 190kg x 6), bench up slightly (130kg x 1 -> 130kg x 3) and deadlift also improved  (220kg x 8 -> 230kg x 8 and 270kg x 1 -> 270kg x 2). So far I would recommend this program."
powerlifting,392os8,swiftskill,2,Tue Jun 9 08:32:34 2015 UTC,"Hi Greg,i have done the beginner 1x a week program for the whole month(from sample programs),and hit 10kg pr on the bench press☺"
powerlifting,392os8,Saplingz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:12:42 2015 UTC,"I ran his 2 x Deadlift, 3x Squat & Bench beginner program for around 11 weeks primarily to increase my work capacity and get my form right, especially on squats and bench.  I was very conservative with my weight increases and low balled my deadlift (since it was my strongest lift). But the program served it's purpose for me, since my work capacity has increased noticeably.  I started TM 4-day split this week and didn't have any issues with volume day."
powerlifting,3930ij,TheBlackDahliaMurder,5,Mon Jun 8 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"same here, I just upped all the weights till it was difficult.  Don't take the program as gospel, if its too easy, fix it!  From what I hear, Sheiko adjusts programs regularly for his lifters as they progress"
powerlifting,3930ij,SimonHukilau,2,Mon Jun 8 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"It might be a matter of semantics but chasing ""difficulty"" is not a good idea. You don't want the weights to be too easy but you don't want them to be so challenging that you begin to lose decent form. The goals are to accumulate fatigue and to refine movement patterns. However if the lift is too difficult then fatigue amd overload will kick in too early, and if you're the lift is too difficult to maintain decent form, or you are too fatigued to do so, then the movement patterns you are reinforcing will be sloppy and may lead to injurious mistakes and/or failure in competition.  It is true that Boris allows for some adjustment and self-regulation in daily training,  and for lifters he is coaching personally I'm sure he might adjust the program too but he generally doesn't approve of jacking up your max, whether it be to make the lift more difficult or not, and if he sees your form begin to disintergrate because of this he will ask you why (I speak from experience here)."
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:52:47 2015 UTC,"Whenever ive ran sheiko, the bench was way too low.  I like a challenge when I lift, and the basic bench numbers in the program never pushed me.  I'm not talking lift to failure and breakdown every day, but I thought the bench routine was too mellow (for me at least)"
powerlifting,3930ij,SimonHukilau,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:00:22 2015 UTC,Which cycles did you run? As I said above you probably needed more volume.
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"i've probably ran all of them at one time or another.  #31 is probably my favorite. It has high volume and high percentages, without full peaking being involved.  I just never felt the bench compared with the other lifts.  so i added a few % to the numbers, maintained the volume and form, and made some great progress.  My bench is big compared to my other lifts, so i might be a little screwy compared to most.  But ive always had to add to the bench on sheiko to make it worth my time"
powerlifting,3930ij,SimonHukilau,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:57:29 2015 UTC,I felt the same. I input my bench max 20 pounds higher than it actually was and I felt that was just right
powerlifting,3930ij,Mikegengsta,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:09:07 2015 UTC,"I understand that. I would say my bench is the lift I can keep the best form with near failure. I understand that I should be staying well away from failure and that the point of sheiko is having every rep be perfect, but doing sets of 3 with 75%? My 5rm is usually around 87% on bench."
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"The sets, reps and intensity does fluctuate for a reason, development and recovery. What part of the program are you talking about?"
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:19:28 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about #37 in particular. That was just an example, but the point is that I look at all the benching in 37 and don't see a single bench workout that's even approaching challenging. I mean, I could do sets of 10 at 75%.  But I'll take your advice and run it with an honest max for the 4 weeks, and like I said, if at that point it feels too easy, I'll adjust from there."
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"And as I also said, adding volume is better than adding weight. I might train with a jacked up training max but I also use a very high training volume now for my raw bench fluctuating between 160 to 200+ lifts per week of bench. I use less at the moment for my equipped bench though as my work capacity under that extreme overload needs some more development."
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:40:42 2015 UTC,How would you advise adding volume? More sets? Adding in more days where  I just do bench?
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"Well considering that you've just come from 5x a week benching I'd suggest that one of the 4 day cycles would be a better fit, and the more frequent deadlifting will be better too. And yes, adding extra sets is usually the best option. Not across the board though. Keep the low volume days low volume but add sets to the higher volume days, and do it gradually. I'd done a full run through of most of each of the numbered programs then progressed onto CMS and MS cycles before I started adding extra volume. Do it gradually and I actually don't recommend doing it the first time through a cycle either."
powerlifting,3930ij,PavidDagan,2,Tue Jun 9 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"Why not do one of the 4 day cycles if you're already used to frequent benching?   The issue of whether the program is challenging enough or not is something you should be addressing once you're actually some way into the program, I'd suggest doing at least 2 and preferably 4 weeks before making decisions on what your training max should be.   I personally run my training max at 10-15kg above my real bench max but I've been doing that for a few years now and know that it works and is maintainable. Boris however was not pleased when I told him what max I used when he was coaching me.  Basically what I'm trying to say is start the program and assess your progress and response before you jack the max up. Don't just do it because so and so said they did."
powerlifting,3930ij,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,0,Tue Jun 9 01:00:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not doing a 4 day because from my understanding that's for ms and cms lifters and I'm not even remotely close to that.  But what you've said makes sense. I'll run 37 based on my real max and if it's too easy, I'll jack it 5-10% for 31."
powerlifting,3930ij,fshead,2,Tue Jun 9 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"The 4 days cycles on the forum are not MS level at all, barely even CMS IMO. And ton the app you can just choose the low volume cycles."
powerlifting,3930ij,jperras,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"I'm currently almost done with Sheiko 30. I don't have the experience that /u/BenchPolkov has with Sheiko, I've asked him my fair share of questions about the program (thank you very much, by the way), but I'll mention what I can.  I programmed my bench numbers around my five rep max when I started Sheiko 37. I haven't failed any reps and my form has been consistent throughout 30 and was consistent through all of 37. The only difficult thing is the volume for me. I can do the numbers that are required but the whole point isn't about difficult or ease but to refine movement patterns. If it's too heavy then you refine bad habits. If it's too easy (I don't know what we'd be defining as too easy here) then take that for what it's worth. I'd rather have flawless form and a decent increase in bench at the end of the program than having ingrained bad form habits and have a potentially higher max but with added potential injury."
powerlifting,3930ij,MonstarGaming,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:08:33 2015 UTC,Benching is inherently a lower effort exercise than squat or DL.  It never exhausts me the way a squat or DL workout does even though my lifts are very even.
powerlifting,3930ij,ceejayess,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:24:34 2015 UTC,"I am currently on my first run of a 4 day program from Sheiko's forum so take this with a grain of salt: Your perception is true but you have to account for fatigue (which may or might not be a big factor for you since you already benched 5 times/week). I found myself to be already exhausted going into workouts calling for 4x2@80% that bar speed was much lower than anticipated at this intensity.   After the first two blocks (adaption, accumulation) although I found the chosen intensity of the squat to be more strange. The highest I have done in the past 10 weeks was a couple of doubles at 85% which leaves me actually worried how the ""test day"" in two weeks will work out when I did not squat heavy in such a long time. With benching and deadlifting at least you perform different overload variations (board press, deadlift from blocks) but with squatting it seems just to be volume, volume, volume.   On the other hand I am totally unexperienced and will wait to see how it works out."
powerlifting,3930ij,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:33:25 2015 UTC,"I added ~30lbs (265->295) to my paused bench press by following the 4-day Sheiko program in about 12 weeks. I followed it almost to the letter; I believe I ended up adding 10lbs to my work sets near the 8th week, but that's about it.  Don't underestimate the value of volume in the 70-80% range for bench press. It pays dividends."

powerlifting,38zh95,Benxbec,9,Mon Jun 8 18:42:22 2015 UTC,I agree - I think his genetics as regards the bench are definitely subpar.

powerlifting,391i8b,BackflipJohnson,10,Mon Jun 8 15:53:13 2015 UTC,In fact 2.5 weeks may result in you coming back stronger.  Ramp up the volume before you go away.  My wife PR'd after 12 days off and myself after 3 weeks found it only took a couple of weeks of training to get back to where I was.  Don't panic.  Your joints and muscles will feel amazing when you get back and you will blast right through any old plateaus super fast.

Look at NFL players they take the whole Summer off.  Getting some time away from the gym is important for all of us and our lifting longevity.

powerlifting,391xrh,145638,18,Mon Jun 8 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"I think cases can be made for both.  I'm of the practice the way you play camp (or perfect practice makes perfect).  I train pause bench, because that is what I do.  Every rep I do I pause.   But that's not the only way, and TnG is just fine for many people.    TnG allows you to move more weight, feel yourself completing bigger reps etc.    If TnG had no place in strength building there wouldn't be Videos of Kiril TnG repping 600+"
powerlifting,391xrh,Lobsterzilla,4,Mon Jun 8 17:45:24 2015 UTC,I've paused my whole life. TNG feels unnatural to me unless I'm doing close grip or dumbbell work.  I also love paused squats.  Paused deadlifts are the devil.
powerlifting,391xrh,rdavis4559,9,Mon Jun 8 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"They're both important. Paused reps build explosive power, tng builds more size (because you can generally rep or lift more tng). Most of my work is done tng unless I'm peaking for a meet. Even then I generally only for 4-5 weeks of paused work."
powerlifting,391xrh,Mdisbrow,6,Mon Jun 8 21:32:11 2015 UTC,Speed day I pause.  Rep days I pause the last rep.  3 and under sets I pause all reps.
powerlifting,391xrh,tec5c,6,Mon Jun 8 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Practice like you play, I say.  I do a competition length pause (or at least, just try to keep things honest) for everything 5 reps and under. Past that I do touch-and-go since my training goal is usually hypertrophy at that point.  I don't pause reps when doing board work, I don't see the point. I probably would if I was doing a max 1-board single or double, but I'm a raw lifter so it would be pretty pointless to do that I think. It kind of comes back to the first point in that when I am doing board work it's generally for higher repetitions to build my triceps."
powerlifting,391xrh,GeneralMillss,2,Mon Jun 8 18:30:45 2015 UTC,"Short answer: choose any or all of the following, ha: 1. If it makes sense B. If you need more strength out of the hole III. If you need practice (timing, recruiting muscle, etc)  I think it really comes down to training focus and cycles.  I train in 3 week cycles and normally everything is touch and go.  I will, however, throw in at least one or two cycles of paused work where I will pause on every rep during down/work sets.  Other than that one or two cycles I normally don't bring pauses into the mix until a few weeks before my next meet, and thats just to get back in the mental game of competition requirements!  Edit:  FYI, I am pretty strong off the chest so my training focus is more in the middle and lockout.  I do 1 cycle of  cambered bar bench and 1 or two cycles of pause work to maintain existing strength and speed and groove!"
powerlifting,391xrh,JollyGreenJeff,3,Mon Jun 8 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"B. If you need more strength out of the hole III. If you need practice (timing, recruiting muscle, etc)   These are the big ones for me.  If you're weak off the chest, you want to make that part of the lift as hard as possible during training.  If you miss 1RM attempts because you misgroove, you want to practice that movement pattern.  If you're strong off the chest and your motor patterns are locked in, then sure, touch and go is a fine way of biasing the rep a bit more towards the lockout."
powerlifting,391xrh,Catechin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:34:08 2015 UTC,I like the idea of using them to accumulate volume in your offseason and then going pause as you get closer to meet time. I think Dan Green talks about that
powerlifting,391xrh,Meat-brah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:04:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on how specific you are in your training phase. You aren't going to be able to get in as much volume training paused as you would with TnG, that's why TnG is good a couple months or more out from a meet. If you are coming up on a meet you should be training paused more because it will up your intensity, lower your volume, plus it is your competition lift."
powerlifting,391xrh,meltmyface,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:02:39 2015 UTC,for me personally 1-3 reps - pause.  Reps 4+ - I go TnG and the last a pause.   More of a mental thing I feel but I've found it enjoyable.
powerlifting,391xrh,IIIII-----IIIII,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:42:46 2015 UTC,"You've got to train the competition lift to get better at it.  That being said, you don't have to do it for every rep you do.  There's something to be said for specificity.  Personally, sets of 3 or less I pause.  More than that, and I usually just pause the last rep.  No reason to get carried away, because while you do paused reps in competition, you're only doing one, not sets of 5 or 8 paused."
powerlifting,391xrh,theNightblade,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:07:34 2015 UTC,"I've done 100% of my reps paused for years, and only about 10% for years... just gotta experiment.  Currently it looks like I'll be pausing everything even on higher rep days"
powerlifting,391xrh,Daveuall,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:26:32 2015 UTC,I like to pause my first rep and then TnG from there. Seems like it helps keep the pattern ingrained while making it easier to accumulate volume.
powerlifting,3910pm,superflexibility21,3,Mon Jun 8 13:42:14 2015 UTC,"I nearly didn't approve this because its kind of a medical issue but having said that I currently coach a hypermobile lifter (she's 6ft and 120kg but is still ridiculously flexible but was apparently mind-bogglingly flexible when she was a competitive gymnast as a kid), and am friends with (and have previously coached) another female lifter who has very hypermobile joints and has just recently been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The girl who I coach (who is competing at IPF Raw Worlds this week) has become less flexible as she has gained more mass and does not really have any issues because of it but the other girl is at a very elite level strengthwise and possibly because of the loads she can now handle has a lot of issues with her joints. She was an IPF lifter but left for GPC partly because this allows her to compete in knee wraps which saves her joints a lot of extra grief.   Conclusion, I don't think there is one. Depending on the cause of your hypermobility it might reduce or it might remain an issue. I would ask a doctor definitely but they will probably just tell you not to lift. So with that in mind I would just be very careful and pay close attention to niggles in your joints."
powerlifting,3910pm,BenchPolkov,2,Mon Jun 8 14:02:53 2015 UTC,Alright! Thank you. I kind of assumed a doctor would just tell me to not lift so I came here first. I've definitely noticed a reduce in flexibility as I've gotten stronger but I wasn't sure if it would become an issue later.
powerlifting,3910pm,BenchPolkov,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:07:14 2015 UTC,The girl with EDS had self-diagnosed herself a few years ago but was only just able to get a confirmed medical diagnosis last year. She has of course ignored all doctors recommendations about not lifting weights for years but now does a lot of work with a physio who specialises in strength sports to make sure she can remain functional.   I'd definitely keep a close eye on it as it may not potentially become an obvious issue until you're lifting much heavier weights but it could be causing ignorable minor issues early on.
powerlifting,3910pm,Catechin,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"The girl who I coach (who is competing at IPF Raw Worlds this week) has become less flexible as she has gained more mass and does not really have any issues because of it   Just wanted to chime in but the same thing has happened with me.  I used to have hypermobile/double jointed knees and they've practically completely gone away since I started lifting.  It's still possible for me to force it, but since I don't, I haven't had it happen accidentally in quite a while."

powerlifting,3910pm,BenchPolkov,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:03:58 2015 UTC,Her most recent lifts are something 180/100/200 @~70kg as a 20yr old. Those are kgs for her lifts too.

As long as you're staying tight and rigid while doing the movements, why would flexibility outside of the lifts be a bad thing? Olympic lifters are some of the most flexible people on earth.  If anything, I'm jealous."
powerlifting,3910pm,BenchPolkov,8,Mon Jun 8 13:57:01 2015 UTC,As long as you're staying tight and rigid   I'm not sure I am? I remember when I first started lifting the biggest problem I had was my hips and shoulders would pop/dislocate. My hips would pop from squatting even with no weight and I'd just fall the fuck down.  But I'm still able to squat now...just a lot less than I bench.

powerlifting,3910pm,SwoleSoul,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"Kelly Starrett talks about hypermobility in this video and also has a series on his website, mobilitywod.com. Basically he says that you really need to focus on getting tight by positions. So for something like the squat, make sure you are screwing your feet into the floor, keeping your core tight, and keeping your upper body tight."

powerlifting,38w3d8,dustyterran,11,Sun Jun 7 12:03:32 2015 UTC,I fucking love this series. I was really struggling with conventional deadlifts. Back in March I pulled 2 singles with 435 and they looked and felt like garbage. I realized I was basically only pushing and then using all low back in 2 distinct movements.  I tried sumo keeping in mind how he talked about pushing/pulling simultaneously and knocked out 8 reps with 315 easier and faster than I ever have before. It was awesome. Finally found the groove.  And he's fucking right about rows too! I was trying to do uber strict pendlay rows with my upper body parallel to the floor and it was too much arms/not enough range of emotion. Definitely gonna try a better angle and using a reasonable amount of body english now.

ROM may be an advantage but hey, look at Leeman or Urbank.   I get your point though.  Coan seems to also have been a master in lift technique, programming, peaking, etc. so all of these things worked together led him to be the GOAT."
powerlifting,38w3d8,rdavis4559,4,Sun Jun 7 17:30:07 2015 UTC,Shorter limbs means the lever has too use less force to move the weight.

powerlifting,38w3d8,johnnysanz3,9,Sun Jun 7 14:22:45 2015 UTC,I really want to try the grip work stuff. I used to climb 3+ hours a day before I started lifting so my grip has never been an issue but I'm usually strongest clinging on to it in the ends of my fingers rather than in a fully closed fist. Grip work never really felt right for me but I usually hold my final deadlift rep at the top till my grip fails (I guess somewhat similar to this). But I'd love to try those single bar holds.  I'd just feel like an ass taking a whole bar and maybe a rack for 2 inches of rom. I wish I had a home gym.
powerlifting,38w3d8,point3edu,9,Sun Jun 7 10:14:53 2015 UTC,You could always do it with a heavy dumbbell? Works especially well if the dumbbell bar is a bit wider than a regular barbell.  But yeah I've always just held the deadlift at the top of my final rep as long as possible if trying to work my grip and works for me.

powerlifting,38vybz,Hardstyle1up,3,Thu Jun 11 15:14:29 2015 UTC,My squat sucks so fucking bad. Deadlift is awesome but I've got 150lb difference between it and my squat. That's weight I'm missing in my total that I have to make up for with my fairly decent bench but a great bench doesn't make up for a huge squat.
powerlifting,38vybz,Sshs152,2,Sun Jun 7 20:24:19 2015 UTC,Same here. 435 squat to a 565 deadlift

powerlifting,38vybz,gslangley_3,2,Mon Jun 8 05:37:37 2015 UTC,Currently doing my Deadlift session Did a set of 4 followed by 3 triples. On my last set I felt a bit of pain on my left posterior delt near the tricep I believe.   Should I not be doing a sort of pullover to keep the bar near me?   Edit: Was using over-under grip. The side that bothered me was supinated
powerlifting,38vybz,MN1H,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:00:41 2015 UTC,"Did you let your upper back round during the set?  Only thing I can think of.  Gotta stay tight.  Supinated side is also really easy to start curling, but that should be more bicep/anterior stress."
powerlifting,38vybz,Catechin,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"Nah, I thought about that and really let it hang! And I wasn't feeling any stress in the bicep either"
powerlifting,38vybz,MN1H,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily call what you need to do a pullover.  Just keep the bar close to your shins, stay tight, keep your entire torso rigid, flex your triceps and keep your arms taught, don't let them bend at all.  Grab the bar like you are trying to keep a crocodile from biting off your dick and then push through the floor like you're trying to kick that croc in the head.  Use that momentum to get you through that portion of the lift/croc destruction and then pull back and up, squeeze your glutes and lockout/hump the bar as though you've just killed that croc and now you're going to skullfuck it via one of the eye sockets.  Seriously though, keep yourself as tight as possible, keep your arms as taught as possible.  It might help you to move the grip of your supinated hand out just an inch or so."
powerlifting,38vybz,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:35:40 2015 UTC,Maybe upper back rounded a little bit. But I doubt it's anythign noticeable. My lower back is solid and not rounding at all.  Moving it out? I have them as in as possible without getting in the way of my legs. I can always test a bit I guess
powerlifting,38vybz,MN1H,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:58:09 2015 UTC,Some people have problems with bar drift and/or windmilling if using a mixed grip and the supinated hand isn't out far enough.  Which arm experienced pain?  Was it on the supinated side?
powerlifting,38vybz,rdavis4559,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:19:53 2015 UTC,Supinated one. I'll try widening it a bit if it hurts again!  It will cost me a bit more rom though ahah
powerlifting,38vybz,MN1H,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"Just try it out on a lighter set and see how it feels.  The pain could have been caused by this but could have been caused by something else such as not staying taught enough, you'll just have to play around until you figure out what works best for you."

powerlifting,38usc9,dontyoushiver,2,Sun Jun 7 00:28:33 2015 UTC,Well done! Fantastic bench! 1.5 times bodyweight is just around the corner.
powerlifting,38usc9,Lou__Tennant,2,Sun Jun 7 09:09:46 2015 UTC,"In the squat your build is good for the lift, so you can continue to train it with that technique.  On the bench you should definitely work on your arch, as it is basically non-existent. You should be mobile enough for this, so work on the arch.  On the deadlift you should probably narrow your stance a bit, along with your grip."
powerlifting,38usc9,Danneborger,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:49:08 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I'm not sure how to perfect my arch. I've experimented with it a lot but end up with a really sore lower back, any thoughts?   Definitely agree with the hands on deadlift. You think I should go narrower instead of learning sumo?"
powerlifting,38usc9,TheAesir,2,Sun Jun 7 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"I bench with a decent arch, always have more low back tightness from it than squats or deads."
powerlifting,38usc9,Danneborger,2,Sun Jun 7 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"While it seems intuitive to get the vast majority of the arch from the lower back, thoracic (upper spine) mobility is just as important. Try to work on thoracic mobility with a foam roller or PVC pipe and try to incorporate thoracic extension when you bench, think about arching your upper back. You should also use a wider grip, it helps tremendously in shortening your ROM. With your strength now, if you get your bench ROM short you'll be great.  As for the deadlift, you don't seem to have anything significantly odd about the way you're built and a lot of girls have stronger glutes and hips. I would try out the sumo stance. If you choose to stick with conventional, try out the narrower stance."
powerlifting,38usc9,Danneborger,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:55:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the in-depth response! I'll definitely try out the foam roller tip. Should I use a super wide grip in training? Or just incorporate it in the weeks leading up to the meet? I try to actually get a regular size ROM to build strength.  I'm going through lots of sumo deadlift videos in my attempt to learn. My squat and deadlift are lagging (at least in my opinion) cause I didn't have a belt and was scared of being injured. Hopefully I'll get the hang of sumo soon, but I'll try doing both in training, thanks!"
powerlifting,38usc9,Danneborger,2,Mon Jun 8 11:28:28 2015 UTC,"You should switch out to maximal width gradually, try doing 2-3 weeks with each grip while progressing 1 finger at a time while going out. Your pecs, as opposed to your triceps will start to take more of the load. Initially you'll feel like you don't have much explosiveness off your chest, but it will go away once your pecs strengthen from the wide grip benching, which should happen fast.   Yes, your bench is strong in relation to your squat & deadlift, this is odd, especially for a girl, when one takes into account where the muscle sits. You should do a month or two of each stance before switching back."
powerlifting,38usc9,brokenheels,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Got it. Thanks a lot for all the tips. I'll do the moving 1 finger at a time + try to perfect my arch. And I'll probably try sumo practice until the end of June, switch to conventional in July and then repeat like that. Will probably be posting a form check for sumo at some point.   I have ridiculous upper body strength compared to my legs... my 1 rep max for strict OHP is bodyweight (125). Hoping to be a beast when my lower body catches up."
powerlifting,38usc9,Mupt,2,Mon Jun 8 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"Haha wow, my max bench is 350-360 but max overhead is like ~150 currently. When you perfect your bench form, go max width with a big arch, you'll be a great bencher."

powerlifting,38rx59,Metallicadpa,11,Sat Jun 6 12:24:06 2015 UTC,Interesting. I find I almost always need to still start at 1plate. But I think that's more about my sumo stance and needing to stretch my legs out a little with the weight before I can move up.
powerlifting,38rx59,point3edu,6,Sat Jun 6 12:58:44 2015 UTC,I get nothing out of starting at 1 plate anymore. I sumo close stance though so maybe it's because the mobility demands aren't as high for me. When I went toes to plates I had to start narrower and work my way out.   Try planking before you deadlift. Planking instantly improves my external rotation. I had it recommended to me by a dude at the gym and I thought it was broscience bullshit until I tried it.

C&P could also be Chaos & Pain, so I'm not 100% sure which you're talking about.  If it's Coan's deadlift routine, I missed one of the reps in week 4 the first time I did it.  Since I didn't have to hit that weight again until week 7, I just continued the program as labeled, and increased the weight on my accessory to try and help compensate.  I hit the reps come week 7 and was fine in week 8 as well.   Also, as for being weak off the floor, maybe try using Snatch Grip Deadlift in addition to your deficit speed work?  That seems to have helped me."
powerlifting,38txug,mtw39,5,Sat Jun 6 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah Coan-Phillipi, probably should clear that up. Yeah Im thinking about just going on, and using accessories as my pick up. Ive never done them like that, I'll definitley try it out and see how it feels."
powerlifting,38txug,mtw39,4,Sat Jun 6 20:25:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say just go on.  The accessories change their format at that point anyway, so you can up the weight.  The second and third times I ran the program, I used Snatch-Grip, Stiff-Legged, Rows and Lat Pulldowns as my accessories.  The accessory work can and probably should be tailored to your personal weak points."
powerlifting,38txug,mtw39,3,Sat Jun 6 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"How do you manage the weight increase for the speed work ? linear increae or percentage of whats being used or something ?  Yeah Im doing the same accessory work, but replace Snatch Grip to deficit deads for the speed work."
powerlifting,38txug,mtw39,2,Sat Jun 6 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"The program gives you weights for the speed work, so I just followed that.  Sometimes rounded up if it involved 2.5 lb plates.    If you're talking about the accessory work at the end, I just started low and then Just linearly increased every week by 10 or so lbs.  That said, I only really ended up doing the accessory work at about 50% of my deadlift max."
powerlifting,38txug,mtw39,2,Sat Jun 6 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats the only thing that would greatly make a difference to your deadlift though wouldnt it ? or would trying to increase the weights for that fuck you over ?  The only one Ive been able to increase is Stiff Leg Deadflits, the others vary depending how tired I get."
powerlifting,38txug,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,2,Sat Jun 6 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much.  There's speed work and accessory work, and I was confused as to which one you were referring to is all.    I kind of forced myself to increase the weight, even if it meant taking longer than advised rests between sets.  It was the best way for me to progress.  That may be different for you though.  Also, are you sure you're eating enough?  That definitely makes a huge difference."

The guy squats high all the time in training (from what I've seen) and then squats with extremely questionable depth. No shit people are going to be questioning your depth.  Are you strong as fuck? Yes.   Is it your fault that the judges passed the lift? Fuck no.  Was it to depth? Fuck no.

powerlifting,38ujtd,Shredlift,2,Sun Jun 7 04:42:06 2015 UTC,It's because he tore his biceps maybe a little more than 6 months ago now. I believe that's the heaviest he has pulled & benched since his injury.

Also I made a mean BBQ steak n bacon pie the night before, and I attribute my success largely to that pie.   Recipe please.  Nice write-up, and congrats on the 500 pull! Have you considered upping your pressing volume, since your bench seems out of proportion with your other lifts?   Nationals is in 5 weeks and I have no idea what the fuck to do. I have uni exams during this time so I can't go balls to the wall with a peaking program. Help?   6 weeks between meets is generally not enough time to do anything other than deload, do a short cycle, and aim to be smarter with your attempts and more prepared on meet day. If you liked the Regular+ template you've modified, just run it again (but maybe with more bench volume, and more of an aggressive week 2 weeks out to get more of an overreaching effect), then decide what to do after the meet. I honestly think it doesn't really matter. 6 weeks isn't that long, especially when you factor in the deload week after this meet and the deload week leading up to the next meet."
powerlifting,38sujt,cjk813,5,Sat Jun 6 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'd drop the reps before dropping anything else. When you can, increase the sets while doing so to get more overall volume in that would obviously be reduced otherwise. Try to lower the weight when everything else doesn't seem to help.   When your strength loss is too significant you may be on a deficit that is simply too high. But in the end until your main lifts stay up you're good. Cutting back on accessories is normal, but you should try to do it slowly and for every exercise in its own context."
powerlifting,38sujt,_predator_,2,Sat Jun 6 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, thanks for the response.  I'll probably give 3x5 on accessories a shot with weight closer to what I was doing before cutting."

powerlifting,38r3fp,CaptainPage,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:15:55 2015 UTC,What are your opinions on this?  http://www.syattfitness.com/westside-barbell/the-feet-elevated-bench-press-is-way-better-than-the-floor-press-heres-why/  I've had points in time within which I've specifically programmed in floor pressing but I've only ever haphazardly employed feet elevation on a bench.  From the little experience I have had with the feet-elevated bench I noticed (obviously) an increased ROM so I suppose a couple of factors in deciding which bench variation to use are   1) whether or not you are wanting to work on your mid-range to lockout ROM   2) wanting to remove leg drive from the equation.

powerlifting,38qwa0,jonlwowski012,8,Sat Jun 6 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"As long as you have no issue getting into position, it seems to me that only good can come of this.   There has been some debate as to the purpose of deficit deadlifts. Some argue that their utility is in improving speed off the floor. I don't particularly like the logic of this; I prefer Jeremy Hamilton's view that their primary role is lengthening the range of motion of the pull. Think of it as equivalent to improving your bench by using a cambered bench barbell. The exercise would allow you to practice harder than you play, and when it comes times to set a PR in a situation where you have decent plates I think it will pay dividends.  Eventually however, to become the best lifter possible, specificity of competition lift training is going to be important. In the long run, if you want to be truly competitive, you may be best served to find a new gym.   Again, this is all predicated on you having no issue setting up to pull at a deficit. I can also stridently recommend against doing anything like a stiff legged deadlift given your situation. If you are having back pain or form issues etc, try setting up to do LOW rack pull. So the bar is in the position it would be if your plates were the correct size.  Hope this was helpful!"
powerlifting,38qwa0,powerliftinglife,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:45:34 2015 UTC,"I do believe that they can help you to get a better feel of utilizing leg drive because of how much deeper you have to get to initiate the lift (assuming you're not stiff legging it) and I feel that the common belief of improving speed off of the floor is because you do have an extended ROM during the push/leg drive segment of the deadlift.  That being said, I'm with you on the idea that the extended ROM is what leads to significant improvements.  Just as you stated, Deadlifts + Deficit Deadlifts are equivalent to Bench Press + Cambered bar or Close Grip Bench or Wide Grip Bench (increased Tricep ROM and increased Pec ROM) or for Low Bar/Wide Stance Squatters you have Front Squats and High Bar/Narrow stance Squats (increased ROM of various muscles).  I also enjoy deficit stiff-leg deadlifts, not just ham/glute specificity but increased ROM for these muscle groups as well (within the context of your SLDL warning above, I will say that I do have the mobility for deficit SLDLs and I'm fairly certain that I've never exceeded 65% of my conventional off the floor DL 1RM for these).    I also agree that it may be best for OP to find a new gym, who knows what other equipment issues may arise.  Despite that, it may be possible for OP to find some cheap new or used bumper plates which can be used to raise the bar to a standard height.  5lb, 5kg, 10lb, or 10kg bumpers would be best as they are light enough to take in and out of the gym and perhaps only one of these plates per each side of the bar would work but I'm assuming OP is at a beginner weight and isn't yet at the point where he would have to worry about one bumper per side not being sufficient enough to support whatever weight is loaded on the barbell.  As you stated, rack pulls from the lowest position is another option.  I don't know what equipment OP has available to him but the four racks (two hammer strength half racks and two differrent full racks) all have their lowest rack positions and/or pin positions at a height such that the loaded barbell would be four or five inches off of the ground.  It might actually be better to set up in the rack but then have OP stand on top of a plate or two to reduce the height surplus enough that the lift is equivalent to floor height.  Obviously the other concern here is reduced bar flex with rack or pin pulls versus off the floor or from blocks but I'm assuming that despite this gym probably having cheap bars, OP isn't lifting enough wait for bar flex to be of a concern.  Regardless, reduced bar flex can arguably just make the lift marginally harder and thus make OP stronger."
powerlifting,38qwa0,rdavis4559,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:15:25 2015 UTC,I'm not incredibly strong by any means but I'm curious about  what you deem sufficient weight for bumper plates not being able to support the wieight on the  bar. I like this idea a lot and don't want to buy bumper plates if it isn't going to work. My current max is 475lbs.
powerlifting,38qwa0,rdavis4559,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"What I meant is that you could get one or two bumper plates of standard height for each side of the barbell and then load the smaller plates after that.  Obviously if you got plastic 5lb bumpers then deadlifting something near your max of 475 would not allow the 5lb bumper to last long at all if they even make it past one rep.  one or two slightly thicker plates per side would be better and I've probably opt for at least one thicker 45lb troy vtx training bumper per side but that sort of depends on you and whether you want to haul in 90lbs of plates into the gym for each deadlift session.    When I say thicker I mean the training bumpers that cost less because they are thicker/less dense and aren't precision calibrated for reduced weight variance per each manufactured plate as measured in grams (versus cheap plates that can vary by up to several pounds per plate even from the same manufactured lot).    Could you try nailing and gluing together some sections of 2x4 and plywood so create blocks which would be easier to carry, lighter, and would allow you to pull from a standard height?"

I went to RIT and when I was there, there was a pretty serious group of guys that trained in the student rec center. Some of them could squat and pull over 500 raw and they had just started messing around with some geared lifting. That was two years ago so I'm not sure if those guys are still there though"

powerlifting,38r71e,Tha_Doctor,3,Sat Jun 6 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"USAPL and IPF rules are different on this point.  USAPL: You can compete in Juniors until the day before your 24th birthday.  IPF: You can compete in Juniors until the end of the calendar year in which you turn 23. If you're still 23 in a given calendar year but you turn 24 later in the year, you've aged out of Jr for IPF but not USAPL.  For nationals, it would depend on what day your weight class lifts on. If it is the day(s) before your birthday, you would be in the Jr. If it is your birthday or later, you would be in the open and would have to have qualified with a high enough total for the open division."

Cutting and bulking will make it happen faster, but doing a recomp will allow you to keep most (if not increase) your strength.   I've done both and found that the strength loss that comes with cutting cycles isn't worth it in my opinion."

This will prepare you for a long and clean bulk.   I'll give you my example, I got fat at 194 in Sept 2013 after a dirty bulk and decided fuck that.   Cut down to 162 (Feb 2014) at ~17%. A year later I was around 178, did my meet. Got a bit fatter within a month up to 181, and began a mini cut. Mini cut lasted about 4-6 weeks (March-Aprilish) and dropped to 172, now going to slooowwlly bulk back and be around 180 for my meet in October.   Tl;dr, cut to a decent base that you won't mind gaining 10lbs from. Begin a slow bulk, read 1lb/month, and do a mini-cut every six months or so when things get a bit out of hand. Rinse and repeat."

I've been using the exact same scale for over 4 years (weighing about every two weeks, same time, same day of the week) so it gives me SOMETHING to go by.  When I was training for a marathon I got down to 155 @ ~15% according to the scale.  I wasn't at 12% or below because I did not have abs showing through at that time.  I've been eating to get stronger and have been hitting the gym for 2 and a half hour sessions (average) 4 days a week with probably 95% consistancy"

powerlifting,38jq9c,Yayyuh,3,Thu Jun 4 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"I believe I would, but not as bad as with squats. It’s often feint when I get tight under the bar and worse as I get closer to parallel and push my upper back against the bar (chest up/bend the bar cue).   The weird thing is, if it’s a pressure thing, surely it’d be worse the heavier the weight gets. Every time I get it, it’s consistent for my first warmup set and completely gone by my third or fourth."
powerlifting,38jq9c,Yayyuh,5,Thu Jun 4 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Well, getting a strain in that area is pretty common.  I'm not a doctor or anything, but I have problems back there from time to time, and I know a lot of other people who have issues in that area.  I think between the rear delt and infraspinatus, it's a really easy area to strain with squats/BTN press/yoke/etc. simply because supporting weight that far into shoulder external rotation requires a lot more flexibility than most people have.    My problem was similar to yours - I had pain going down into my arm that was almost like a nerve was being pinched somewhere, and I found a trigger point just under my rear delt that I worked out with a lacrosse ball and that solved the problem.  I'd recommend that you try the same thing.  Try pressing it into that area from several different angles - it can be tricky to find the right area to hit.  And of course, if you're getting non-therapeutic sort of pain or your nerves are getting pinged like crazy, go see a doctor.   The reason I asked about pressing is because if you're squatting lighter weights, there's more of a chance that you're supporting weight with your arms/delts, rather than letting it lay on your back.  You're still supporting the weight, but you engage your rear delts more when you're pressing.    edit: got my biomechanical jargon incorrect.  smh"
powerlifting,38jq9c,captainsalt1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"That makes so much sense, I’ll definitely get a lacrosse ball around that area and try and hit it.

The actual pressing didn’t massively instigate it, but I got it into a low-bar position and rotated left/right from my hips, pretty much the exact same sensation as when I squat; the shock feeling and slight burning, especially when I rotated left and pressed the broom in a little.  Gonna hit it with a lacrosse ball (just ordered) and foam roll my upper back a bit. Thanks a tonne!"

powerlifting,38jq9c,Haymakers,2,Thu Jun 4 19:14:20 2015 UTC,I had that problem when I first started. I first started high bar and went lower. Problem is I never went wider with my hands. I've had previous injuries from benching incorrectly in my shoulders. Go wider with your hands and see of that helps.
powerlifting,38jnj7,Beardedandtatted94,9,Thu Jun 4 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"I have a buddy that uses them.  He likes training with them.  I'm a bit biased, but I think it's mostly because putting up higher numbers in the gym makes him feel bad-ass.  My opinion is that he's not getting as much valuable work on the weakest point in his squat, which is coming out of the hole.  Overloading may be useful for getting mentally accustomed to higher weights...but I wouldn't spend a whole session on it (which is what most guys do when overloading involves putting on/taking off cumbersome underwear).  YMMV"

powerlifting,38jnj7,farmerstein,7,Sat Jun 6 16:32:47 2015 UTC,silly.   briefs necessitate a change in technique. you're overloading a different movement pattern than a raw squat.
powerlifting,38jnj7,140kgPowerSmith,3,Fri Jun 5 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"To me, it really goes against the whole ""practice how you play"" philosophy, which people follow to varying degrees. In my own training, I follow that philosophy quite closely, but really, it's a matter of opinion and preference.  I could see ways in which you might overload certain parts of the movement, but all you really need to be concerned with for a raw squatter is making it through the sticking point, which for 90% or raw squatters is coming out of the hole, somewhere close to, but above parallel, where the quads and glutes have the most work to do. I don't see how briefs would aid someone in overloading this, since I would imagine you'd want to be overloading your the weakest point in your ROM."
powerlifting,38jnj7,GeneralMillss,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have issues with tightness and bracing that exacerbate their weakness at the bottom.  For those people, it might have some value.  If the weak point really is just quad/glute strength, then yeah I agree."

I guess that it could depend on where you are at with your squat, and how high of a frequency you are squatting at. I would say if you don't squat around 500, I wouldn't really see the point. That being said I'm not a geared lifter, and I don't know the ins and outs of wearing briefs."

powerlifting,38jnj7,Oleh0349,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Wearing a pair for speed work would be a good idea so you can go really wide and protect the hips. It'd give you another variation for heavy and rep work too.  But the number 1 reason I like gear is because it teaches to really hammer in technique because there is a lot less room for error and it will carry over to your raw work.

Now lean over about 45 degrees.  Now pull the imaginary bar down and tense your lats. You will notice that your chest comes up automatically. Now try to fold your chest back down as if you were folding over under a squat. You will not be able to do it without releasing your lats.   That is the point of the cue. To keep your back tight and your chest up under a heavy load."
powerlifting,38gi0c,Phrali,23,Thu Jun 4 05:46:41 2015 UTC,Pulling the bar into your back doesn't actually make the lift physically harder. I get the mental aspect but from a physics standpoint you aren't lifting more weight because you're pulling it in your back or anything.
powerlifting,38gi0c,my_lastnew_account,-2,Thu Jun 4 04:23:38 2015 UTC,"Your arm muscles are exerting a (roughly) downwards acting force aren't they?

powerlifting,38gi0c,Olaf1,26,Thu Jun 4 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"Your arm muscles are exerting a (roughly) downwards acting force aren't they?   No.  Put a bar on your back, and step on a scale. Note the reading. Now pull on the bar as hard as you like. See if the scale reading changes.  Technically yes, the hands are exerting a downward force on the bar. But we don't care about the bar, we care about the combined bar-and-lifter system. By Newton's Third Law, the bar is exerting an exactly equal upward force on your hands, so the net force on the bar-lifter system is zero. Simultaneously, there is a normal (contact) force from your back onto the bar, which prevents the bar from accelerating downward as your hands pull on it. The contact force from the bar onto your back prevents you from being accelerated upwards as the bar pulls on your hands. These forces again cancel out for a net force of zero on the system.  It's the same reason you can't levitate by pulling on your own bootstraps. Forces internal to a system never generate net force on the system, because this would violate Newton's Third Law and also the conservation of momentum."

powerlifting,38gi0c,Torlen,7,Thu Jun 4 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"I coach the same cue, pull the bar down as hard as possible. As mentioned it does three things:  1) Lat tightness, can't beat it, flexing lats isnt the same as pulling them down. Lats are a primary lumbar spine stabilizer so...this is a good thing.  2) Helps cue elbows down. Elbows down = chest up, same as elbows up when doing a front squat.  3) Stabilizes the bar. If you are squatting with a decent weight, or a crappy bar many times it will have a tendency to whip, this will help to stabilize it.  It feels awkward as crap the first few times."
powerlifting,38gi0c,flannel_smoothie,3,Thu Jun 4 15:20:26 2015 UTC,It's a  Proxy for upper back tightness.

powerlifting,38gwca,El_Robertonator,10,Thu Jun 4 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda confused at the question. There's no ""law"" governing volume of a workout. Everyone is different as are their goals.    However if you are really trying to work on increasing strength, you need to spend more time doing 3rep or 5rep sets near your max (75-95%.)  Edit: for example my current 1rm is a tad over 700. A heavy training day for me would look like this - Just the bar (10-15 reps) - 135 (two sets of 20) - 225 (2 sets of 10) - 315x3 - 405x3 - 495x3 - 585x3 - 605x3 - 625x3 - 645x3 - 655x3 and add 10 lbs every set til failure"

powerlifting,38gwca,koolaidman123,7,Thu Jun 4 14:17:40 2015 UTC,"135x15, 225x10 etc isn't going to do shit.   volume doesn't mean shit because it doesn't take into account the level of stimulus, this is why sheiko uses total number of lifts and average intensity, and rts use rpe and fatigue %, because volume by itself doesn't tell you anything"
powerlifting,38gwca,koolaidman123,3,Thu Jun 4 12:59:26 2015 UTC,"When I see volume totals they typically don't include warm up the 135 and 225), and sometimes even post-exhaust, so I was interested in learning full workout volumes for some of you - or if that in fact is irrelivant/uncalculated, and when you start counting.  Thanks."
powerlifting,38gwca,markers920,3,Thu Jun 4 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"warm ups (i count 50%+) are still useful for calculating overall average intensity  without knowing average intensity, volume doesn't mean anything, hence why volume is a bad indicator in training"

powerlifting,38gwca,rdavis4559,5,Thu Jun 4 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"Currently have a DL-only day and a Squat+DL day.  Total volume for each of these days averages out to roughly 21,400 and 11,400 so around 32,800lbs per week.  Believe it or not my bench volume exceeds my DL volume by a small margin while my DL volume exceeds my squat volume by a tiny margin.  It isn't apt to question whether 23,000lbs is or isn't too much volume for you.  Even without considering your 1rm, many factors determine whether volume is too much, including whether or not your body likes a lot of volume, your focus on active recovery, your fitness level, sleep, nutrition, supplementation, STEROIDS, etc.  My body loves volume and frequency on top of that but that's my body.  I can squat four days per week whereas Someone like Matt Disbrow does only once per week or the Lilliebridges (among others) who squat heavy every other week and lighter on the weeks in between while deadlifting with the opposite load (light/heavy)."

powerlifting,38ejb2,rdavis4559,2,Fri Jun 5 14:00:10 2015 UTC,Mike's videos are the best for deadlifts (any lift really). Just that one change of consciously flexing the lats before pulling made a huge difference for me.
powerlifting,38ejb2,zobger,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:35:14 2015 UTC,Mike just started training at my gym. Might start living there so I never mess the chance to watch him lift.
powerlifting,38ejb2,RadioContra,9,Thu Jun 4 16:24:29 2015 UTC,"I like doing pause deadlifts.  With about 50% weight, lift the bar just off the ground, hold for a second, take a breath, pull just past the knees, hold for a second, take a breath, finish the lift, repeat.  You might instinctively think this sounds like a bad idea, because breathing will mess up your core tightness, but in my experience that hasn't been an issue, and it has made my back tightness specifically worlds better.  In the first few weeks of doing this, I would stand up from the set and look like I wanted to fight people, because my back muscles were so tight I was standing up taller than ever, chest out like I wanted to push people with it.  I've shown this to several workout buddies of mine and every one of them has adopted it, with quite a bit of success."
powerlifting,38ejb2,KanadaKid19,8,Wed Jun 3 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"If your back tightness gets progressively less as you increase weight then its simply a matter of strength.  Your back is weak, and thats ok.  Not a big deal and can change in a few months of focused strength work.  Heavy bent rows, dumbbell rows t-bar rows, pendlay rows, weighted pull ups, lat pull downs, and all of those with varying grips, wide, standard, close.  Add a few of those movements to your DL session twice a week and you will see a noticeable difference!!  Another big factor to mid-lower back stability is your abs, more importantly your lower abs.  The support they provide to the back is often overlooked by many lifters."
powerlifting,38ejb2,JollyGreenJeff,4,Wed Jun 3 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"Pull your shoulders up and back to flex your upper back, get a big breath and squeeze your abs against the belt. Squeeze everything. Then, before you take off, pull the slack out of the bar by giving it just less than the amount of pull it takes for it to leave the ground. Then go.  This not only give you the cue to get tight, but it will also keep you from jerking on the bar, which can cause you to lose your setup/tightness.  If you're still having problems, just keep building up strength by lifting with a little more volume and a little bit less weight."
powerlifting,38ejb2,gravitystorm1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"shoulders up and back    For me, pulling shoulders down is a crucial part of back tightness. Depressing the shoulder blades, in other words. The added advantage is that the weight won't pull depressed shoulder blades up, but it will try to pull elevated shoulder blades down. I think Mike Tuchscherer (in a different video than the one linked above) talks about this for tightness as well."
powerlifting,38ejb2,Marcel-P,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"When I do that I feel almost zero upper back contraction. Maybe I misunderstand the cue, but when I shove my lats down it feels like a flare, which I don't think supports the spine well. For the most part when I started squeezing up, I got a lot less rounding and cleaner pulls. Like thinking of making a thick back versus a wide back. I'm not an expert, but it made a big difference for me so I thought I would share.   Here you can see me shove my lats down: 515x1  Here you can see me actively squeezing up: 465x6  I think the pulls were much cleaner in the second video.  Edit:   The added advantage is that the weight won't pull depressed shoulder blades up   I don't like this comparison. Say you're shoving your shoulder blades down toward the bar, your upper back will round. Say you are shoving them down towards your butt, the direction of the force of the bar will be somewhat perpendicular to this position, contrary to what you say. The lats will still have to fight against the bar to keep from rounding, and I feel the most fully flexed position is backward and up."
powerlifting,38ejb2,gravitystorm1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:22:04 2015 UTC,"I have the opposite experience, even in terms of thick versus wide, with depression giving me more tightness and much less back rounding. It's worth noting that the lats are a muscle responsible for scapular depression, but either way, I get the impression that we have different goals/perspectives with back. For me, I want to maintain thoracic position (via rhomboids/lower traps/etc.) with lats and QL connecting upper and lower back as a separate and independently emphasized part of core stability. I depress scapulae to maintain thoracic extension and integrate the lats consciously aside from that (partially cued with how you grab the bar and set the arms as shown sometimes by Dr. Stuart McGill).   Say you are shoving them down towards your butt, the direction of the force of the bar will be somewhat perpendicular to this position, contrary to what you say.   I don't really understand this. Scapular depression is not conducive to rounding at all, and the force will not be perpendicular (or if so, slightly and still to a lesser degree than if you weren't bringing them down) as long as you're anything less than perfectly horizontal.  Also, I sincerely promise that I don't mean this as a knock, but it doesn't look like you are maintaining a particularly rigid back in your 465 video, so I'm not sure how the raise thing is shown to be that helpful with back tightness, especially since the weight is lighter across the vids.  edit: I don't have any comparison videos because I always depress, but I do think I do a good job with back rigidity. Hopefully that shows that at least the cue is viable in helping back tightness, if not a bit individual: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiCe6gUqGCs.  edit 2: Also found the Mike video I mentioned above, might as well link it for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm7ZbgjZklE."
powerlifting,38ejb2,Marcel-P,2,Fri Jun 5 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"I don't take it as a knock. It's true (PR attempt), I just dont have many videos but I was trying to give an example.   I'm just not seeing it though. Sitting here trying to flex into that position, it doesnt feel better. Maybe its a personal strength/weakness point, but I would say my lats are lagging behind the rest. Anyway, would be glad to have someone show me."

powerlifting,38d8ac,lieagle,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:05:36 2015 UTC,You reduce volume and increase intensity over a period of weeks with the meet planned so that you are near 100% of your 1RM when it comes time for the meet.

powerlifting,38d8ac,thejooceymoosey,3,Wed Jun 3 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your definition of cheating. To me, cheating is doing something against the rules in order to gain an advantage. In the IPF,  PEDs are banned in competition, thus their usage is against the rules. The rules don't say that competitors must pass drug tests, they say that competitors are not allowed to use drugs, and they use tests to enforce that rule. So, by that definition, taking drugs and competing in the IPF is cheating, or at the least unsporting conduct.   It seems that you're asserting that it's not cheating, since you could look at it from a standpoint that drug tests must be passed, and that's it. While this is the most practical way of looking at it, to say taking PEDs and competing in a tested fed is not cheating is something that I disagree with.   I do, however, agree that it's completely naive to believe that every competitor is natty just because they say they are. It definitely, definitely happens and is happening."
powerlifting,38d8ac,PoopPraetor,2,Wed Jun 3 23:01:06 2015 UTC,I compete untested and would never go near a tested organization. I simply think it's unethical and can hurt people's aspirations who want to compete natty. I just accept the fact that there is no drug free organization.

powerlifting,38eqbj,Darth2132,9,Wed Jun 3 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"I've been asked this often enough that I have a full explanation saved, ready to copy and paste:  I trained under Dan Green for a while and during this time I ran two variations of his in-season programming as well as one cycle of off-season programming.  Dan Green's off-season program is essentially bulgarian for squats only and it differs from what Greg Nuckols laid out in his recent manual release in that Dan's program starts off with backdown sets, Greg's says to start off with the daily maxes/minimums first and then incorporate backdowns when you're ready.  I've run Dan's program in the past with great success and was spurred to do so again after reading Nuckol's (and Omar Isuf's) manual. I decided to use the same programming Dan applied to squats and used that programming methodology for the bench press as well and again I'm seeing great progress.  As it happens, I make better progress on my deadlifts during Dan's off-season/high-frequency programming as well.   I don't remember the programming for deadlfits from the Bulgarian Manual but I'm sure it isn't  with the same high frequency as squat or bench.  Dan's off-season and normal programming cannot be found online via clearly laid out routine templates, ebooks, or otherwise. You can see Dan's own training logs on the Animal forums and if you search on youtube you can find some video logs from his current and former clients which would demonstrate his programming but you'd have to extract that information by watching the videos - Brandon Campbell and Mike Peltz are examples and even Tee Cummins trained under Dan for a time.  As Dan's programming has not been released and his perpetually imminent ebook release (been waiting a couple of years now) has not yet happened, I wouldn't feel comfortable laying it all out there but I've compiled my modified version of Dan's off-season program into something you can check out:   https://www.dropbox.com/s/ddffmv29ulbhtpp/RBBSM%28HIHF%29_Sample_2015-00-00_to_-.xlsx?dl=0  I've made a ton of notes on the split, progression, and %s - check the NOTES tab before looking at the actual programming.  In case you're curious, in the past fifteen weeks I've taken my high bar 1rm from 410 to 450 (now exceeding my low bar 1RM by 5lbs).  Paused Bench went from 290 to 310 , and strict standing OHP from 171x1 to 190x2.  My front squat 1rm was 315 and though I haven't tested my 1rm in this cycle, three days ago I hit 300x3.  I also haven't tested deadlift 1rm this cycle but my existing PR is 526x1 and nine days ago I hit 500x3.  I haven't been focusing on the deadlift much relative to my squat and bench."

Secondly, Izzy has spent plenty of time under the bar, his personal best lifts (S 450? B 320 and D 500?) are probably higher than most raw lifters on this sub. He does have real time under the bar, I think hes stated that hes surpassed intermediate programming.

Wearing olys ended up teaching me proper leg-drive and explosiveness from the floor. The ROM increase is like a quarter of an inch, so it's irrelevant. What does make it more difficult though, is not being able to bring your glutes through as hard through lockout, so in a sense it overloads the lock. I did it for around 8 months and when I came back to flats, I had much better technique from the floor and a stronger lockout since I had been making it harder with olys.

I have long arms and long legs so my hips are very high and my back is very horizontal relative to a lot of lifters. My tendency is to use a lot of low back in my pull, and the shoes help me get a lot more leg drive in the beginning of the lift.  Is the extra 1/2 inch or so of rom ideal? No, but it makes my pull feel smoother, better and I get better speed off the floor."

Barefoot was slightly easier for me, but I had to relearn how to cue my shoulders so that the bar moved straight up (only took two days, no major impact anyway).

powerlifting,38da3y,nigelregal,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:44:08 2015 UTC,What I find is that you will do best in the shoe you start to deadlift in and making a change will feel weird often. If you start lifting in oly shoes it's what you are used to and adapt to it. Going from that to barefoot might feel weird at first as you might be less stable on the ground. Once you get use to that I would imagine you could lift more.   I bought Chucks for deadlifts as I have some balance issues with my thin feet specially for sumo but being so used to barefoot having the sole makes a big difference when i'm lifting closer to my 1RM. I feel more stable with chucks but the height difference is enough that I wouldn't compete with them.
powerlifting,38da3y,GuziCowSki,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:10:38 2015 UTC,Would OLY shoes help with speed off the floor in sumo?  or is it purely dependent on the lifter/leverages?

powerlifting,38da3y,Knuckledust,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"Oly shoes make you taller which results in a larger distance you have to lift. I think if you are weak at the bottom of the deadlift, oly shoes could be used as a good tool to help strengthen the bottom of your lift in practice. You would never want to compete with oly shoes. If you are thinking to yourself, ""then why do oly lifters use oly shoes?"" the answer is because there deadlift is so much higher than there clean and snatch, that although they lose power at the beginning of their pulls, it is made up for and then some when they get low to finish the clean and snatch."
powerlifting,38eu4e,Kaoshjerte,2,Wed Jun 3 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"Welcome to TeamTornMeniscus!   Here are some things that I went with or would go with when I could:   Smolov Jr.: Lasts only 3 weeks, will fuck you up when you generally can't handle high volume and high frequency. The gains you get from that won't last very long, but it isn't a peaking program for no reason. Generally wouldn't recommend it. 5/3/1: I did this when I had a knee injury that wasn't that severe, so I could add row variations as another main lift. I also could OHP at that time, so I had 3 Lifts to progress with the 5/3/1 scheme on. To be honest, when you only have bench to use this for, it gets boring as hell. Conjugate Method: This is what I'm currently doing. You just do ME Bench - Rest - DE Bench - Rest - ME Bench - Rest - etc. You see the frequency for bench is twice as high as generally recommended for conjugate style training, which is why variation for the ME bench movement is more important than ever. Take 1-2 days rest between every session and add in days with light back/shoulder and arm work (call it GPP) when you feel too wrecked, especially when the next session would be ME. It works great for me currently, you can ask more questions if you want but I don't want to spend my evening with laying it out completely here. Sheiko: This was my first thought when I stood before the same question as you are now. I would've run it for sure but my gym only has one bench, which means I cannot do some sets on it, then do something else and then return to the bench as it is mostly in use by someone else at that point. When you don't have that problem, definitely give it a go!   In every case you should always try to row and pull as much as you push (volume-wise) to keep your shoulders healthy.

So, if I'm wearing it above my pelvis in a squat, I'd be wearing it just below my rib cage for the deadlift, or maybe even slightly over it on the sides of my body. I'm 6'1"" at a generous 260lbs, so if you're shorter/thinner/wider then your mileage may vary.  Don't be afraid to wear it a notch loose if you have to. Sometimes I actually have to do this on meet day since I've been eating a lot."

powerlifting,38ehhi,slingsby93,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:52:19 2015 UTC,"https://www.t-nation.com/training/the-belt-and-the-deadlift  An article from Coach Rip about how he prefers to see people pull with a 3 inch belt. Would definitely make the switch if I could afford it, as I also experience difficulties getting into position for the deadlift.  However, the path that I've personally found preferable is doing all of my deadlift training beltless and slapping on a belt when I want to test. For whatever reason, this has actually made a better deadlifter out of me. Given that you only have to deal with the discomfort of pulling with a belt every couple of months, it's not much of a big deal"
powerlifting,38caqc,145638,9,Wed Jun 3 08:12:04 2015 UTC,I take my breath before bending down to grab the bar. I can take in more air and get tighter. Then I breathe at the top of each rep for the same reason.
powerlifting,38caqc,Porchbeer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:16:29 2015 UTC,So you exhale everything out when you pull?
powerlifting,38caqc,OwlShitty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:21:11 2015 UTC,I exhale or grunt a little naturally. But my lungs aren't empty by the time I'm at the top. I don't try too exhale much because I feel I lose tightness.
powerlifting,38caqc,Porchbeer,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"So you just exhale a little bit then once you get up at the top, you inhale for more air?"
powerlifting,38caqc,OwlShitty,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:23:21 2015 UTC,Yes. My exhale isn't something I really think about. Don't overthink it. Do what feels strongest.
powerlifting,38caqc,Porchbeer,4,Wed Jun 3 21:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're pulling conventional. For me I take a deep breath before I get into position to start the deadlift and try and hold it until I lock out. I found doing it before I sit into position let's me take a bigger breath which helps push against the belt. I also prefer to wear the belt a bit higher for dead lifts (almost under the ribs) compared to squats.   Also, I found if I breathe out too fast I get a bit light headed so I try to do it with control.  I've heard of people that start to exhale when they hit the sticking point but im not sure about this. I prefer to keep the air in for tightness.   Not sure if this will help you but it works for me."
powerlifting,38caqc,acewolk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:39:02 2015 UTC,"Practice makes perfect and its important to find what works for you. Maybe spend a day experimenting with different setups, belt tightness, belt position etc."

powerlifting,38caqc,AeonCatalyst,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:08:19 2015 UTC,Do you have a buckle or lever belt?  Just breathe again.
powerlifting,38caqc,noweight2heavy,3,Wed Jun 3 10:20:18 2015 UTC,Exhaling during lockout is actually not the best idea because you relax your core when you exhale out. Watch the deadlift video on the Art of Manliness YouTube channel. They have Mark Rippetoe on there and he explains the deadlift from start to finish.
powerlifting,38caqc,Little_foot15,2,Wed Jun 3 10:46:22 2015 UTC,Breathe at the bottom of your set while you're prepping to pull another rep
powerlifting,38caqc,lieagle,2,Wed Jun 3 11:47:58 2015 UTC,"A great exercise is what I saw on George Leeman's channel is what he calls ""Don't Die"". You lay down on your back neutral back with a little curvature. Get someone you put a heavy dumbell or kettlebell on your abs and flex and hold the tension.   The goal is to make sure the weight doesnt sink into your so you are bracing and pushing against it but while doing so you are also breathing.  It is pretty effective."
powerlifting,38caqc,mazze01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"For me what I've noticed about breathing and staying high and all that jazz is that your posture makes a difference in how you feel in regards to your belt.  You can take the biggest breath in the world, but if you let your shoulders forward or let your back round out, your gonna lose that tight feeling. So check yourself.  Other than that it's just trial and error. Finding out what rythme works For you. It took me about two years to finally get a decently paced rhythm! Feels great! Good luck!!"
powerlifting,38caqc,JollyGreenJeff,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"I've been experimenting with two different ways and both seem pretty solid thus far. I've been trying these two ways to see what feels better so I can focus in on one. I also lift conventional.  I get into the position and get everything set up with my feet/hand placement but ass up and take a big breath here. I then go ass down to get into position and get tight as possible. I'll let out a bit of air here getting tight and go ass up again to get some more air but trying to stay relatively tight. Then I'll pull. I decided to try it out from seeing  Eric Lilliebridge to see how it would work for me.   The other way is to get your breath at the top, and go straight into the pull. I feel like I get a bit tighter using this way so I tend to do this when I'm pulling singles."
powerlifting,38caqc,jraximus,-5,Wed Jun 3 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"If you can't push out that well against the belt, wear it one notch tighter.  Exhale slowly on the way up, speeding up the exhale as you get closer to lock out.   Big inhale on the way down rght before pulling."

None in DC according to that site.  Once you find a gym that trains powerlifters I'm sure they can give you better intel, but this is a start anyway."
powerlifting,38dfaf,Kaimal,2,Wed Jun 3 14:38:17 2015 UTC,"I lived in PG for a few years.  This answer may no longer be true, but it was when I was there.  SSPT is/was the best and only choice.  We had a lot of people from VA who trained there.  Odds are if you work a 9-5 you'd go insane trying to go as your only gym but maybe you could go 1x a week or something.  I drive about 60-75 minutes each way 2x a week to go to a good gym so I know it can be hard.  Not suggesting we're the only option, but the only one I know anything about, USAPL Maryland is/was a little more active than USAPL Virginia.  Virginia put/puts on meets in the coastal area and Richmond, but there is one in NoVA this month where you might be able to find way more info about where everyone trains:  Saturday, June 27 Virginia Chapter of USA Powerlifting 8459 Richmond Hwy, Alexandria, Virginia 22309  Found it on USAPL VA Facebook they don't seem to have a website of their own"
powerlifting,38dfaf,fwopr,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll check SSPT out. I figured I might just do once a week at a specialized gym then do the rest of my training at Golds."

Haven't tried SSPT but the Collesieum was great. Would definitely be too far from NOVA though. I would go there but it's about 20 minutes from work, then like an hour drive home, so I just found a local gym that has most of what I need. I suppose I could get up to SSPT a bit, but it's pretty expensive and they have bad weekend hours."

Hard to get a good idea from your description.  It's likely that your knees cave because your ankles are in bad position due to the lack of arch in your foot which is likely causing over-pronation."

They are the only thing keeping the last bit of arch I have left.  When I run or jump I use my toes and ball of feet to push. In normal shoes, I'm restricted and my feet swell up.   When I squat, being barefeet or in vibrams, I grip the floor with my toes and this generates a lot of power for me."

powerlifting,388pq9,Magic_warlock0-,2,Wed Jun 3 16:04:35 2015 UTC,"It looked like the weight was moving fine up til lockout, and then maybe it was just getting a bit in front of you, causing you to lose balance. Do you know what specifically was causing that shift in balance? Also, I noticed that on your second attempt, even when it appeared that you were about to lose your balance again, you didn't give up on it until it literally catapulted you through the air, which is potentially the most badass way I've ever seen someone fail a deadlift."
powerlifting,388jbz,gweneddk,14,Tue Jun 2 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"This article disregards the fact that you can't really gain or lose weight without gaining or losing both fat and muscle (you can change the ratio but that's about it).  Super heavy weights are fat because once you are in a weight class with a minimum and no maximum it really doesn't matter how fat you are.  Putting on the most weight possible will also have you put on the most muscle possible.  I'm not saying that fat doesn't do anything beneficial at all, but I think this article misses the far simpler explanation which accounts for more of the effect, which is that as you get fatter you also get more muscle tissue."
powerlifting,388jbz,lift_heavy_things,7,Tue Jun 2 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"Well, they do make the comment ""in the upper categories of both sports there is no bodyweight limit, so athletes who gain weight to get stronger have less inducement to control their fat accumulation.""  In other words, most athletes are trying to gain muscle. It's just that the SHWs don't really care if they also pack on fat in the process.  I am someone who definitely struggles to add muscle and strength without also adding fat. Most of my accumulation cycles have me training most of the time at a slight deficit just so that I can make my weight class, but I've made the biggest strength gains when I'm more free with my calorie consumption. I think I've reached a level where I need to take breaks from lifting for strength to focus on cutting body fat if I want to consider staying at this weight class or dropping down to the next one."

powerlifting,388jbz,Aryjna,7,Tue Jun 2 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"That solution is hypertrophy. (And of course that hypertrophy must be of the myofibrillar variety needed by most athletes, not the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy preferred by the bodybuilder.)   I thought that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy had been proven to be mostly a myth."
powerlifting,388jbz,welltired,3,Wed Jun 3 09:24:00 2015 UTC,"I know in real life, I'm way stronger when I'm fatter - and its easier to lift when you are in a constant caloric surplus.  That even counts for the deadlift - where its harder to get in position, but once you are locked in, the belly on the leg helps get the bar off the floor.  The issue is, getting recently up to 121kg, it just makes every other aspect of life harder."
powerlifting,388jbz,Danneborger,2,Wed Jun 3 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think your last point is where people get lost. They try to pull the ""life out of the gym"" aspect into lifting. Being fatter is harder, but of course you'll lift more if you weigh more. Health and wellness are totally separate from lifting."
powerlifting,388jbz,KrytieTV,2,Wed Jun 3 09:43:19 2015 UTC,My question after reading this article: Is the intramuscular fat that changes the angle that the muscle attaches to the bone the same thing PLers are referring to when they say that gaining/losing fat causes their leverages to change?
powerlifting,388jbz,timacles,6,Tue Jun 2 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"While I'm not a powerlifter and read this subreddit purely as education, from a physics point of view (which I do know a lot about) that will probably be what they're talking about.  If intramuscular fat changes the nagle the muscle attaches to the bone, the direction of the force applied by your muscles will be different and thus generate a different amount of torque. The change in torque might or might not benefit your lift."
powerlifting,388jbz,AeonCatalyst,2,Tue Jun 2 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"Its part of a culminating effect of what happens when you gain fat, but not the whole story. I doubt they understand the process from a deep scientific point of view like this, they just know it helps.   You get intramuscular fat which affects the muscle angle like mentioned. You also get subcutaneous fat which simply adds padding to your body. If your ass and thighs are 1.5 inch thicker. When you squat down, they'll simply press up against each other, providing extra stability and also a reflex type effect sort of like a squat suit. Same thing with bench, if your arms and chest are 1-2 inches bigger, when you're at the bottom of a bench, its going to give you something to press up against and push.   On top of that there are reflexes which our nervous system reacts against to allow to lift more weight when you are bigger, due to the increased perceived stability."

powerlifting,386hj2,Allternator,4,Wed Jun 3 11:58:28 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that, despite coins achievements, his is not the only way of doing things. In my mind, knees sliding forward as he described is more likely to impact the musculature around the ankles and knees.   Do you squat with a particularly wide stance? Or pull sumo for that matter? I would associate this more with a hip flexor strain  In the case that you are struggling with your knees coming in, I would recommend a pair of Olympic lifting shoes with arch support. I saw mike t suggest this and it fixed my issues with knee caving instantly. If you do squat with a wider stance, it may be advisable to use flat shoes. Try and find a pair with SOLID arch support, not like a soft insole or something you would find in a jogging shoe"

They might be a tad sweaty but I think most people would be cool with it"
powerlifting,388imu,Daveuall,3,Tue Jun 2 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"Relevant discussion by Alex Viada...     Thank you, Mike, for bringing up silliness again. No, neoprene knee sleeves of any sort do not, can not, and will not add rebound to a squat. Neoprene foam has nearly zero rebound elasticity and does not appreciably resist joint angle changes, or wetsuits would be impossible to swim in. Neoprene foam knee sleeves also do not adhere to the skin beneath them as tightly wrapped knee wraps do, which means that the sleeves are not stretching to a significant extent regardless (as they're sliding across the skin). It does not matter how tight they are.  They also do not ""warm the joints"", as local external insulation cannot and will not appreciably increase the temperature of synovial fluid.  These two facts do not particularly care if you know somebody who ""gets 20 pounds out of them"".  The benefit from sleeves is more along the lines of proprioceptive feedback and POTENTIALLY some lateral stability, both of which can increase confidence and therefore force output (by eliminating the body's tendency to avoid maximum force output if it ""senses"" something in the system is unstable).  If you get ANY rebound, it's due to them bunching behind the kneecap. Which doesn't come into play in most powerlifting squats.  Edit- I'd like to add- if you feel like you can squat more with knee sleeves on, you're probably not wrong. As long as they improve your squat form or confidence, what does the reason matter? The purpose of this post is just to state what they do and don't    https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10101081721867514&id=1302662"

powerlifting,388imu,SnaKiZe,2,Tue Jun 2 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"People try to convince themselves knee sleeves don't add anything... Who are you kidding. Especially SBDs, the amount of rebound they give is by all means statistically significant and more so on the advice of sizing down. Hell I use a medium pair and I can probably afford two sizes smaller but the mediums require me to rest with my legs extended otherwise I start getting uncomfortable. Other knee sleeves are more lax which may not provide much rebound but still help with proprioreception at the joint.   As far as I've read for health and recovery purposes, it certainly makes my knee feel warmer, but the pubmed articles I've read have no conclusion that knee sleeves for the healthy athlete actually provided any help. Certainly for people with osteoarthritis though."

BTW, statistically significant? Has there been a few studies done yet about this? I'd love to peruse the literature about rebound with knee sleeves; sounds like an extremely interesting topic."
powerlifting,388imu,Magic_warlock0-,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"Another person, but if you are questioning if knee sleeves add lbs, consider the basics physics being applied, the addition of knee sleeves should make the bottom portion of a squat easier. As the material is being compressed, the sleeves are trying to push back to their original form. Whether or not the extra weight is significant is of course dependant on the rigidity and tightness of the sleeves"

They just make squatting more comfortable and give you some compression really. I picked up some SBDs earlier this year and they're great, but don't think you'll get poundage from them, maybe 5lbs to your max."

If anything they give me mental confidence. I do believe that some lifters with lower squats get some good bounce out of them but I've yet to meet anyone with a squat over 200kg that can actually say they give any quantifiable carryover. I have however heard a million people on the internet who've never worn them or at least never competed in them say that they're cheating.

powerlifting,386sys,Mupt,2,Tue Jun 2 10:02:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I was hesitant during training prior to the meet but just try not to worry about it too much. During warm ups it was a bit of an issue as it was harder to break the floor with it, so just focus on getting speed off the floor and lockout should come if you have the momentum+strength.   With my actual lifts it felt really good (especially the 250). The bar really moves with you if that makes sense?  Will it feel different? Yes, but don't worry about it the weight is still the same. Also the knurling is very aggressive so be aware of that as well"
powerlifting,386sys,welltired,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:16:24 2015 UTC,Ah sweet as. Thanks for the information. I actually had a session on with one today with calibrated plates too but only worked up to some triples at 175kg. It felt alright but I'm not sure how it'll feel with heavier weights.

It ruins my deadlift (consistently -15kg difference) but most of my friends can't even notice a difference
powerlifting,386r6h,kiwiiboii,3,Tue Jun 2 06:40:40 2015 UTC,"The way that Westside is ran, you're basically going to be focusing on your squat with the deadlift as an optional ME for lower days. What you're more likely looking for is a more traditional powerlifting split. That said you're probably not going to want to deadlift and squat on back to back days. I'd run something like:   Sunday: Heavy Upper Monday: Heavy Squat, dynamic deads Tuesday: off Wednesday: dynamic upper Thursday: heavy deads, dynamic squat Friday: accessories Saturday: off"
powerlifting,386r6h,TheAesir,2,Tue Jun 2 13:10:08 2015 UTC,I think this is the best split for me. I can get all 3 movements in and still do dynamic effort days.   Thanks for your input!
powerlifting,386r6h,mazze01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"Would you do 3x5 or 5x3 after the ME squats and deads before the secondary movement of that day?|  After a rough calculation having ME+3x5 and Dynamic Secondary movement twice a week (for lower body) would roughly give a volume of 180ish lifts (variations of the S,B and D) a week. That is excluding accessory work.  Without having the 3x5 after the ME lowers would mean ~150 lifts overall above 50%.  ~100 lifts above 75%.   I am just thinking it might not be enough stimulus without the 3x5/5x3 on ME days."
powerlifting,386r6h,SEdiesel,3,Wed Jun 3 10:51:38 2015 UTC,Conjugate doesn't run like that.   Sounds like you already have an idea of what you want to do...
powerlifting,386r6h,_predator_,3,Tue Jun 2 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"1 - ME Squat & Deadlift 5x3 / 3x5 2 - ME Bench & Accessories 3 - GPP / Back / Arms / Shoulders 4 - DE Deadlift & Squat 5x3 / 3x5 5 - DE Bench & Accessories 6 - (Same as 3) 7 - Off   Next time you'd do:   1 - ME Deadlift & Squat 5x3 / 3x5 ... 4 - DE Squat & Deadlift 5x3 / 3x5   Please note that you can always change the order of these training days, but I wouldn't recommend that you do two Max effort sessions directly after each other. Doing DE Lower directly after ME lower etc however could work, but each day utilizes the repetition method, which means that you should be aware that you are doing a lot of volume on each of those days. Your body doesn't only need to recover from maximal loads but also from the volume.  Of course you should change 3x5/5x3 to whatever feels right for you, you might even don't do it at all and keep the frequency lower and stay closer to the original program. GPP work is well approved by Louie Simmons according to his book to keep you healthy and balanced, so squeezing one of these in between your main days shouldn't be a problem."
powerlifting,386r6h,_predator_,2,Tue Jun 2 13:45:22 2015 UTC,The only problem in see with this is the ME Squat/Deadlift on the same day. I feel much better separating them. Currently I'm squatting 3-5 sets at about 85%-90% and feel no soreness or fatigue doing deadlifts the following day at the same percentages.   I think TheAesir's split would work much better for me. This way I can do all 3 movements every week and still do dynamic effort days in between.   Thanks so much :)
powerlifting,386r6h,mazze01,2,Wed Jun 3 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"I think you are misunderstanding what I was saying. 5x3 / 3x5 is in no way intended to be Max Effort. Max Effort is in mostly working up to your daily 5/3/2/1RM, just for the strain of it. Of course you don't want to do that for two exercises on one day.  5x3 / 3x5 was an addition I and many others use to get more volume and more frequency for the main lifts in, because 1x/week is definitely not enough for most people when it comes to squatting, except you are one of those strong mofos who have to go to the gym when nobody else is there because they need all the plates even for their warmup sets. I wouldn't go much higher than 75% on those.  And again, don't forget about the volume you are doing besides the maximum and dynamic effort methods, do not underestimate that when planning your training."
powerlifting,386r6h,radio_room,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:18:34 2015 UTC,Ahh I understand now. I think my only problem that I can see is the 3-5 rep range. I've been doing 3-5  for quite a while now and I feel like heavy singles and doubles allow me to do more sets and get the same amount of total volume in.   I'll try splitting my days like you suggested and see how I feel.   Thanks so much!  Good luck to you!

powerlifting,384luw,Candusick52,4,Mon Jun 1 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Not wrapped tight enough. Lack of confidence in the lift because you're trying something new screwing with your head. Not taking advantage of the extra speed out of the hole. You squat in a very hip dominant way.  Many things can be the cause here, I suggest posting a video."

powerlifting,384luw,krakino,2,Tue Jun 2 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"Could be a ton of things - wraps too loose, wraps too tight, wraps not stiff enough, wraps not soft enough, poor wrapping style, poor squatting style for wrapped knees, etc...  I'd recommend training with a group of guys who have experience wrapping knees. If that's not an option, try a softer wrap (like Inzer Z's) and start with a loose wrap, almost like a tight knee sleeve, and once you get comfortable, crank it tighter and tighter and eventually move on to a stiffer wrap.  One common problem I see are guys using too stiff/too tight wraps the first time and having it throw off their technique so much that it actually makes it harder. Always remember, control the wrap, don't let the wrap control you."
powerlifting,384luw,HaughtPockets,2,Tue Jun 2 01:31:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you don't have them tight enough. I struggle to even hit depth with 365 with mine.  One thing is that when you're not used to them, it doesn't feel any easier but you can lift more. When I first maxed out with wraps, my unwrapped max with wraps felt like a true 1rm and I felt like I was going to pop a blood vessel or something with ~110% of it."
powerlifting,384luw,SwoleSoul,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:49:34 2015 UTC,If they were as hard as without wraps then you definitely didn't wrap right. The wraps are meant to make the lift easier since they store potential energy through the descent. Wraps should be painfully tight or they won't do much.

powerlifting,385fpe,OmnipotentStudent,14,Tue Jun 2 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"It's your first meet. You aren't going to set any records. You will very quickly learn that no one at the meet will care what your numbers are, only that you showed up and contributed to the event. Cutting weight isn't going to make much a difference and introducing cardio and eating less will likely hurt your performance.  That being said, considering it's only 2-3 pounds, I would stop doing the cardio. If you dropped some of your carbs, you would drop more than enough weight. If you loaded up on salt and water the next 2 days (typically double what you normally drink) and then tapered down (about half of what you normally drink) you would drop more than enough weight. Honestly you could probably do it by skipping dinner the night before and waiting to eat until after weigh in.

powerlifting,385o3q,GuziCowSki,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:10:35 2015 UTC,I dropped 5/3/1 for deads after a few months and subbed Mag/Ort in its place. Worked very well.
powerlifting,385o3q,BenchPolkov,2,Tue Jun 2 03:19:57 2015 UTC,Doesn't Mag/Ort use an AMRAP for the last set? Or do you just stop at 8?
powerlifting,385o3q,Ferboten,2,Tue Jun 2 08:17:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I used to stop at 8 or do lots of sets of 4 afterwards. Though I know of some very strong deadlifters who like high rep sets I far prefer to be able to walk out of the gym.
powerlifting,385o3q,BenchPolkov,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:38:05 2015 UTC,"Extremely happy with Mag/Ort so far. I'm switching back from sumo to conventional and have adopted Mag/Ort (with a lower training max ofc) to relearn the pull, the 4x4 and 1x8 sets at lighter/moderate weight really help me get quality reps and keep the form intact"
powerlifting,385o3q,JosephusBroz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"I started out on 5/3/1.  Following that I ran Dan Green's in-season and off-season programs and thus far I've found his off-season to be the best thing for my deadlifts.   5/3/1 - Not sufficient in the categories of deadlift volume or frequency as it pertains to my own body. Dan's in-season - 3x5 main sets can be taxing after a while, especially when considering that the first half of the cycle has an ascending 3x6 deficit deadlifts and then 3x8 deficit stiff legs both following the main sets.  The reps for these assistance sets taper down a bit in the second half of the program but block pulls are then added in.  Weight on the main sets progresses by 10-25lbs per week. Dan's off-season - this is high frequency squatting so squats always precede deadlifts here.  First day is squat up to a top single, backdown 15% 2x3 and then: deadlifts for sets of five to a heavy five, deficits an ascending 3x5, deficit stiff legs ascending 3x6.  Four days later is: squat to a top single, backdown 10% 3x3, then do the same for deadlifts as the first day but the main sets are sets of three rather than five and no stiff legs.     Perhaps I'm a weakling but I prefer the second deadlift day because I enjoy sets of three reps much more when it comes to heavy convention deadlifts off the floor.  Regardless, I seem to respond better to this off-season programming and its rep/set schemes and frequency more optimally than anything I've tried in the past.  The only caveat is that I can't say how much I benefit exlusively from the aforementioned deadlift programming versus or in conjunction with benefits from high frequency squat programming.  Note: if you're a sumo deadlifter then on both DL days your main sets are sumo and you'd suplant deficit DLs with sumo block pulls, same rep/set scheme still applies and deficit stiff legs remain on the first day.  I've heard of Mag/Ort numerous times and have likely reviewed the logic behind it but I remember none of it now and have only been awake for fourty-five minutes and as such I'm still somewhat incoherent.  I'll look it up again now out of curiousity.  Finally, I've never run a full Cube cycle but for a change one day last year I decided to try out the rep deadlift day once just for kicks.  Deadlifts for sets of twelve reps?  That's some intense and perhaps slightly insane work.  I could handle it but my heart was nearly beating out of my chest and the skin on my poor hands felt as though it was about to melt off."
powerlifting,385o3q,rdavis4559,5,Tue Jun 2 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"I don't find high rep deadlifts to be effective, form breaks down long before I actually near failure and so to go hard would be dangerous. If you want more volume to help your deadlifts, you're probably better off doing low bar squats. If you want to get the grip benefits, just do double overhand shrugs with ~80% of your max deadlift until you can't hold onto the bar.  Also those percentages seem off, 60% of the weight you can do for 4x6 is basically nothing."
powerlifting,385o3q,SwoleSoul,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's all still a work in progress, all I really know is that I want to mix up Heavy weights with low rep sets, Medium weight with mid rep sets, and Light weight with high rep sets. Everything else has been an educated guess based on what I've read. I'm just trying to mix it up with a linear progression maximum. I've only got 315 lbs of weight to deal with in my basement gym, so I haven't tried any max DLs."

powerlifting,385o3q,needlzor,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:00:37 2015 UTC,So it's 4x6 at 100% of your best 4x6? seems kind of redundant
powerlifting,385o3q,markers920,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"Not really. If you were doing SS, or some other linear program, it would be 100% of your best ever lift weight for that set/rep scheme. I guess his first sets go up by 10 pounds, and the next schemes up by some fraction of that. It does seem fairly complicated."
powerlifting,385o3q,markers920,2,Tue Jun 2 03:47:26 2015 UTC,"Then a better term for it would be RPE 10, rather than 100% (which is usually used for % of 1RM)"

powerlifting,385o3q,Itlan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"Percentages are typically used in a different context on here (of one rep max), so I'd be careful overloading the terms.

I never yell.  I never scream, but inside I'm going crazy.  It's what works for me.  Sometimes before a big lift attempt I'm on the verge of tears.    However, when I watched Jordan walk around or sitting in the back preparing, he was very calm.  But a serious and deliberate calmness where you knew in his head it was all war.  He never let it come out or show in the traditional sense, but if you were watching him, you could tell he was anything but nonchalant.  I definitely look forward to watching him lift again."

Magnesium deficiency can lead to muscle fatigue and loss of endurance, I have no idea if I have a deficiency but I have two bottles of the stuff from a while back, might as well use it.   Essentially, I take three supplements, amino acids, whey and creatine. Amino acids have their benefits, but really it's just wishful thinking."
powerlifting,384pr9,jayfabric,3,Tue Jun 2 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"I just usually drink few cups of coffee before gym, really helps me. Also I need the right kind of music. And the music needs to be something you don't listen anywhere else than in gym so you always address that music to lifting. George Leeman has a video about training your adrenaline where he speaks about this, good watch even though it sounds like broscience.  E: link to the video"
powerlifting,384pr9,Kouzmanovich,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"I've had a similar problem lately, and was trying different pre-workouts to see what worked best. I recently started using Gat: http://reviews.bodybuilding.com/GAT/NITRAFLEX/  I can lift and stay focused for about three hours on this stuff. It was recommended to me by some bodybuilder friends, and I thought it was bullshit, but this is some potent stuff. Completely changed my workout; no more yawning in between sets, no more slacking because I was too tired. I get everything I want done.   Music is great at keeping me motivated, but I try not to rely on it as it's really just a controlled adrenaline rush during your favorite parts. Jayfabric below mentioned controlling your adrenaline release, and I have to agree with him, it sounds like broscience but it does have some truth. I find if I get myself hyped and take really short breaths before a PR attempt it goes much better than my regular mental start-up. Look it up and see if you can see some change in performance.  As far as food goes, I usually workout in the morning, so I start off with a ton of carbs but keep my meal very small, drinking a ton of water during my workout. For me: a large piece of rye bread with a ton of peanut butter, a glass of milk, and some kind of fruit (and of course, my pre-workout).  I'm sure some others can chime in. Everyone is different, so don't be afraid to try some new things."

But for the most part, I did pretty well without a handler/coach... As the group of people I train with pretty often are a group of powerlifters, whom 2 competed with me, were around to help me set openers/attempts (which i feel were picked out pretty well, I just failed to deliver, nbd)"

powerlifting,381ln2,raichet,2,Mon Jun 1 12:40:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I didn't really test until I started with Candito's 6 week. Another reason behind why I didn't really test was because I knew I was getting stronger. I was still able to add weight to each workout and still, for the most part, get through them, so I didn't feel that I needed to test all the time and waste energy.  I believe the popular train of thought is to milk LP for all it can give you and it does hold true. I could have easily switched to 531/gzcl instead of deloading but I stuck with it and I'm kind of glad that I did.   It is a good program for building strength, I feel."

Your opening squat was borderline depth but you'd pass in many federations. Your second attempt was very high, no lift.  You are pressing with the bar too close to your neck. You're working an arch and then pulling the bar to your chest where it really should be hitting the upper abdominals or lower chest at the highest. You shouldn't press to mid chest because A) It's weaker B) It's harder to control C) You will push right into the peg.  Deadlifts were fine."

powerlifting,37zzo2,Dacendoran,6,Wed Jun 10 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"To me, you're not even getting close to hitting depth. And contrary to your belief, I think it is a strength issue. Your quads get to a certain point of the descent where they can no longer take the load, so your body transfers the load to your back via you leaning forward too far, which is why you end up doing a good morning on the way up. Your back is compensating for your lack of quad strength. Do you have any videos of you doing lighter weight? That way we can rule out mobility."

powerlifting,37zzo2,Dacendoran,3,Tue Jun 16 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you can hit depth, which means that it is probably not a mobility issue - although the weight you're doing in those new videos is still too high to say for sure. Is it even possible for you to do a squat without doing a good morning? Find a lower weight where that stops happening. I still think it is a quad strength issue, but I did notice one other element that could be playing a role. You are using a pad and maybe even a towel too? You need to have the barbell on your traps. By adding that cushion, you are placing the bar higher up, almost on your neck. This imbalance could be part of the cause for your body leaning forward. However, if you are using the pad because the bar is rolling up on your neck without the pad, then you are only putting a band-aid over the issue.  http://www.strengtheory.com/fixing-the-good-morning-squat/  Usually, a good morning squat occurs after you hit the hole and are coming back up. With you, you almost immediately dive into a good morning on your descent - very early. I've never seen it before, to be quite honest. I wish I could be more help. I think its your quads. If not that, your upper back tightness. If not that, possibly your ankle and hip mobility."
powerlifting,37zzo2,Dacendoran,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"This is the bar I'm using in the newer videos, it forces you to sit more upright so you don't get dumped forward. The powerlifting coach at my gym reccomended I run w ith this bar for a few weeks to work on not collapsing.  I'm having a 1 on 1 with him this friday I'll post again after I get some feedback  I suppose I'll switch my squat accessories to work out my quads."
powerlifting,37zzo2,goforglory,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting. In the description of the bar, it says ""the weight distribution falls between the front squat and the high-bar back squat to vary your power output training"". This means that you will get dumped forward if you can't support the weight in an upright position. And that is exactly what is happening. I'm definitely interested in what your coach has to say, as I am just a keyboard warrior with no training certificates of any kind lol. Have you ever experimented with low bar squatting? For one, you are forced to lean over as a consequence of having the bar so far down your back. Second, it reduces the depth needed for a clean lift (in terms of a PL comp). Those are 2 of your main concerns right now, fixed just by changing the type of squat you are doing. Good luck m8!"
powerlifting,37zzo2,Dacendoran,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:17:04 2015 UTC,The previous post and all my other lifting have been lobar squats.   I honestly didn't even realize I was getting dumped forward that's how I've always squatted

I started using the queue ""open your taint"" from Ed coan and my squats regained their explosiveness, and started to stay more upright."
powerlifting,37zzo2,GothicToast,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of your breakdown is mental and mobility.  You're really struggling to hit depth and you end up losing tightness to try and wedge yourself into it. Hip mobility is most likely lacking here. Also, it's hard to tell but it almost looks like your knees are collapsing inwards. You need to really think hard about externally rotating your hips/spreading the floor. which ever cue works for you. I use both. But externally rotating your hips will also get your hips more open for you to get into the hole easier.  And on top of all this, I think you're really benefit from some oly shoes. Romaleos or adipowers have been the most popular. Try squatting with a 10lb plate under each heal, and if that elevation helps then an oly show will probably be like night and day for your squat."
powerlifting,37zzo2,goforglory,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I CAN hit depth, I can do a full third world squat and hold it for 2-3 minutes before burning stops. I've been doing Chris duffin's deadlift/squat warmup.   I was told by the powerlifting coach to start doing squats with the safety squat bar in order to correct the chest collapse.   My knees are collapsing in a lot of these, it's always an issue I've had.  I'd love to buy weightlifting/squat shoes but sadly I cannot afford them, unless I were to eat less food/not pay some bills."

powerlifting,37zzo2,flannel_smoothie,-1,Fri Jun 12 07:45:48 2015 UTC,"If I widen my stance I just go deeper in the hole.   This shouldn't be possible. Put your feet together (most narrow stance as possible). Now squat down. You will probably get so low that you can sit on the floor. Now set your feet as wide as possible and squat down. Chances are your butt will not touch the ground - or even come close. When your hips are open, you simply can't squat that low."

I'm thinking the right leg is stronger so he favors it, or more specifically a stronger right glute or maybe tight right hip flexor? I'm not sure if they can both be tight though.

I now feel I can hit 190 for a triple and hopefully 210 at my meet in 3 weeks time. I hit 200 a month a go at qualifiers. Reasonable goal?
powerlifting,37zzo2,Itlan,2,Thu Jun 11 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"First off, phone's broken so no video unfortunately, but next time I'll make sure I get a video.  So I'm 16, and have been training seriously for about 4/5 months now. Today I hit a personal best on my strongest lift, my squat, of 135kg (300lb) for a 1rm. Given that I'd be in a -67.5kg weight category and T2 (16/17 year olds) if I compete (IDFPA) as I'm Irish, how well would you think I would do, and is it a good weight to be lifting? Thanks a million. Edit: I'm 64kg (140lb)"

powerlifting,37zzo2,Lobsterzilla,2,Thu Jun 11 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"Inconsistent bench, gone from 5 reps to 13 to 5 at 60kg within a week. Got videos taken today and there's a lot wrong:  https://youtu.be/HNE1SNQKZRI - this video shows that I don't bring the bar down to my chest straight down, but I bring it down right of centre (left on the video)  https://youtu.be/GBWCWBUPC6c - can clearly see I bring it down wonky, also my grip width doesn't seem even...  https://youtu.be/6P_FhC0bG2I - you can see that I bring the bar down in a J shaped movement and also that one side is lower than the other at the bottom  I'm not really sure what to do to combat these problems and if there is a main problem that is causing the rest. My left shoulder is tighter than my right and has been giving me a little bit of pain recently but is fine atm so maybe that's an issue? It's probably due to the fact that on grindy reps, my left is always working a lot harder than the right because of the way I bring the bar down.  I feel that the best course of action is to lower the weight and work on sorting out lowering correctly and evenly but I'm not sure what to try and address so I'm hoping you guys might be able to spot something that will help me out. I'm thinking double check grip width (how have I been getting this wrong...), try and lower centrally, maybe something to do with left elbow placement?"
powerlifting,37zzo2,SimonHukilau,2,Mon Jun 1 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"Your left hand looks like it has slightly more rotation than the right, maybe forcing the bar back in your hand. Also your grip on the left seems slightly wider."

I was trying out a few different techniques here. The first rep is with my hips higher, my scapula less retracted and my lats and shoulders more rounded in towards my chest, (think Pete Rubbish) the reps after are with my hips lower and scapula retracted (think Elliot Hulse) which really helps with my lat tightness and brings my chest out more but it does feel slower and heavier, Is this because my mobility needs to be better and/or because I'm not use to the latter form?

powerlifting,37zzo2,spaiceBrownie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're dropping down into position and pulling right away. Try taking an extra few seconds to get tight under the bar and engage your lats, this will get your upper back tight enough before you pull for it to maintain position throughout the lift. You should be getting tight enough that on your light warm-up sets (135# range) the bar starts to come off the ground a little bit before you even start pulling."

powerlifting,380f7y,rsaplan,2,Sun May 31 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"You could tear the pec from the deadlift if you're not tight in the lats and upper body as you initiate the pull. Could be flat upper back or rounded upper back but I think rounded may be more susceptible. As you initiate the pull while not tight, and the bar is about to break from the floor, your shoulder girdle will be pulled forward as the rest of the body is going back and up. So your body will scramble and do what it can to lock in the shoulder blades and collar bone before it's too late. This puts immense stress on the pec minor as it's looking for stability and can lead to a strain or tear.    Jay Nera explains it much better in the Animal back to the basics video.

powerlifting,37z971,GuziCowSki,7,Mon Jun 1 05:34:05 2015 UTC,when you are the strongest deadlifter and squatter in your gym by far but when it comes to Bench you are maybe in fifteenth place on a good day.  Such is my life.
powerlifting,37z971,rdavis4559,12,Mon Jun 1 06:15:21 2015 UTC,When you're the strongest bencher but a mediocre squatter and deadlifter its even worse believe me.
powerlifting,37z971,BenchPolkov,6,Mon Jun 1 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"That's me, dawg. Been benching for a while. Just started squats and deads.  I'm repping 360 on bench, and just yesterday, I was overjoyed that I hit new PR's of a 2 plate squat and 3 plate dead.  My world is upside down."
powerlifting,37z971,PoopPraetor,2,Mon Jun 1 12:11:22 2015 UTC,For real? How big are your arms vs. legs?!  I thought I had it bad with more than a 2 plate bench but barely a 3 plate squat.

powerlifting,37z971,rdavis4559,2,Mon Jun 1 02:33:06 2015 UTC,"Not too bad. Just do more hypertrophy work and work on your bench setup. I'm at around 450/330/550 and don't consider myself a poverty bencher. I think it's natural to not have a very high bench relative to one's squat and bench, especially as a young guy."
powerlifting,37z971,Danneborger,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"Based on USPA classifications for raw lifters my squat and deadlifts were both somewhere around the top end of class II but my bench was in class III (if I'm remembering correctly).  Anyway, definitely putting the hypertrophy work in.  I started something akin to high frequency/bulgarian for both bench and squat sixteen weeks ago and this has done more for my bench than anything else I've tried before.  My prior 1rms were 445 squat (low bar), 526 DL, and 290 bench.  My new 1RMs are 450 (high bar so who knows about low bar), 526 DL (haven't tested this 1RM but hit 500x3 very recently), and 310 bench.  It took me eleven months to go from 285 to 290 bench and twelve weeks to go from 290 to 310.  Also took overhead press from 171x1 to 190x2 multiple times.  I'm currently benching three times a week and OHP once.  Hopefully this will continue to work for me but now I have to manage cutting a small bit of weight while working to maintain what strength I have gained."

We my boys and I went to 2 different parties.  I probably drank like 15-20 beers. Then my friend chris and I got dropped off at a little kickback where they were doing the worst coke I've ever snorted.  I felt bad for them so I picked up 5 points of some good stuff. Fast forward to around 8am and I'm starting to come down.  I get this overwhelming feeling of shame and guilt. I can't keep it to myself and start spewing my guts to my buddy, smiley. We talked it out and he told me some real shit. Got me so worked up that I ended up walking home. I called my parents to come out and told them everything. That I abuse alcohol and coke, that I don't believe in god, all the things that I lie about. My dad said he already knew,  my mom was taken by surprise. All things considered,  they took it fairly well. I feel relieved that don't have to front anymore. I need to regain control of my life."

powerlifting,37z971,failon,2,Mon Jun 1 04:35:40 2015 UTC,One person's success doesn't necessitate it being a good idea. Its a high risk strategy and more people seem to fail than succeed in my experience.

powerlifting,37z971,failon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:11:02 2015 UTC,No that's true. I was more saying it because people always use you as an example of it working successfully but the thing is people never make posts about their failures so we never get the other side. If you've made it work and developed a good management strategy for all the risks then there is no reason for you to give it up just because someone says its a bad idea.
powerlifting,37z971,BenchPolkov,1 point,Sun May 31 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"That's fair. The context here was me saying I was going to do it again, then being advised not to, presumably by people unfamiliar with my background.

The champion British lifter Stephen Manuel also uses it frequently for meet prep for his squats. Again he knows what he's doing but if a less experienced lifter tries to use him or you as justification they're definitely off the mark.  I've run it for all 3 lifts and was successful at least once for each lift. It added 15kg to my deadlift but I was pretty much unable to walk for most of it. I have also caused myself mischief in running it again for squats and deads but as I've learnt more about programming for and coaching lifters I've come to realise that it really is not a well balanced program and potential for injury is too high when used with PL. You shouldn't have to literally survive a program to get good results. Even sheiko cycles in all their mythical brutality are nowhere near as bad as Smolov."

powerlifting,3802kp,Shay-Muss,2,Mon Jun 1 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"the routine is already relatively low volume so dedicatin an entire week to testing 1RMs for each lift isnt the greatest way to go IMO  You could just do some light benching after friday's deadlifts, tke a couple days off then test your 1RMs the following monday. if it's not a meet dont hold yourself to 3 attempts"
powerlifting,3802kp,Shay-Muss,1 point,Sun May 31 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! So would you recommend I try and PR all 3 on the same day? I was thinking staying ‘fresh’ for each lift but I always feel better benching after squatting (something I’ve missed on this program), just wondering if I’d get fatigued when it comes to deadlift but I guess I can do a bit of autoregulation on the day. Thanks so much!"
powerlifting,3802kp,NotanotherKovu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:43:20 2015 UTC,I'd go ahead and test them all in one day. It more closely resembles a PLing total and squat drives progress on the deadlift on most programs inclusing Candito's so having a max 10 or 20lb less isnt a big deal
powerlifting,3802kp,enchiladas93,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yep, I feel that it’s a bit more indicative of what I could do in a meet, too, if I test my maxes in the same order as I would a meet. Thanks again :)"

powerlifting,380on9,Catechin,2,Mon Jun 1 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"Eat 'maintenance lite' on training days, don't eat much that isn't protein on rest days, you'll drop some fat and still get in good lift sessions.

powerlifting,380on9,ceejayess,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:53:41 2015 UTC,Yeah this is sort of what I was thinking.   Maybe eat at maintenance and add some cardio in there. Like pickup basketball or jog a few miles every other day.

Mag/ort is based off of a GOAL deadlift. what is a realistic 10 week goal to base that program around?"

powerlifting,37wa84,Danneborger,1 point,Sun May 31 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, your bench is higher than is common and your deadlift is lower than is common in comparison to your squat. are you sure you squat more than you deadlift?

powerlifting,37wa84,BenchPolkov,2,Sun May 31 02:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like it's pretty out of wack. But I just hit 405 last week with solid form and depth. Even in high school, I had awesome depth with squat, so it does have a serious head start of about 6 years as far as training goes. My weakest muscle group by far is also my back and lats. So that, along with only having 5 months of dead lift form under my belt adds up to a really sad dead lift. Part of it may also be psychological. I had a bigger squat than I do right now in high school, so I'm used to that load, but I'm not used to dead lift load."

powerlifting,37vwa1,JANICE_JOPLIN,1 point,Sun May 31 00:06:21 2015 UTC,Just as it feels right. Maybe 10 lbs a week. Rather maintain health over everything than rush back for no reason

That's in the 93kg class though, 205lb.  In the WPC it's a T3 record of 175kg. You're probably going to have to look through each different fed's world records and compare them yourself."

powerlifting,37ufx5,OmnipotentStudent,2,Sat May 30 15:22:11 2015 UTC,/u/N3ver3nder88 is correct. 165kgs at 93kgs is the current Sub Junior (ages 14-18 inclusive) raw WR.   Keep in mind that this will most likely jump up quite a bit at Raw Worlds in a week or two.... I would not be very surprised if the new record ends up being 185+.

I've got younger friends pursuing some records at the moment, and a friend who holds records in the U18 74kg class, looking to expand that to U20s and eventually U23s. It's always good to get an idea of how strong you are relative to your peers.  Edit: I have another friend who's taken records all the way up to the open class and he recently totalled 835kg/1840lbs raw w/o wraps at 120kg. So he's a strong dude and he's only 21 or 22."

Maybe he's just poaching off of /u/gnuckols Bulgarian squat article. I don't know what purpose the 1/2 miles lunges serve... but I kind of want to do them.

powerlifting,37ujct,Metallicadpa,4,Sat May 30 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"If you're getting results from a more moderate approach I see no reason to try daily squatting. It's an extreme methodology and it need not be explored until other options have been exhausted. Personally, I use it as more of a peaking method, and it's effective as hell in that regard. I've experienced increases of 50lbs in a matter of weeks."
powerlifting,37ujct,SwoleSoul,1 point,Sat May 30 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"I may try this. Although, I would be worried about overuse injuries easing into a meet. This has happened before running a smolov :("
powerlifting,37ujct,lqhsdarkstar99,3,Sat May 30 16:48:01 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, and I haven't actually done squat every day as such (I have 'squatted 7 days a week, but it was usually only 2 days low bar squats and other days were variations like overhead squats or paused front squats back when I was basically living nextdoor to a gym), and I didn't get any injuries. The idea is that you're never pushing yourself beyond what you're capable of, and this means that you really need to know your body and what you're capable of on that day. It was very maintainable for me, but I'm young, was in a heavy surplus (500-750 calories a day), gaining just over 1lb per week and I had time for a nap every day on top of normal sleep."
powerlifting,37ujct,Chicksan,2,Sat May 30 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"I have done a month of Bulgarian training and made significant strength gains but gradually got joint pain so stopped it (I went way too heavy though, grinded a lot of reps). This was right after doing a few months of more volume, so I consider it just an extremely effective peaking program. It was also the most fun I've had lifting in ages, my favourite thing is heavy singles and I got to do that on both squat and bench every day."
powerlifting,37ujct,Chicksan,1 point,Sun May 31 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"The squat everyday approach is based on a very limited amounts of squats. Doubles and triples up to a technically sound single, is quite a bit different than the volume in most programs. He said that it takes less than 20 minutes, than it's whatever else he does."
powerlifting,37ujct,HaughtPockets,2,Sun May 31 07:54:13 2015 UTC,I think it works and more people should train with higher frequency. We're a sport of three movements so those should be practiced very often like any other sport. But I also think it's just another way to do things and people have built huge squats doing it only once or twice a week. This is pretty much how I would train all the time tho if it was my only responsibility.

powerlifting,37ujct,Uneditable,2,Sat May 30 15:35:07 2015 UTC,I think success just comes down to consistency and actually liking what you do everyday. I'm a workaholic so I designed a program where I can lift 5-6 times a week and I love it. 3 or 4 day splits are too boring for me. The opposite could be true and 6 workouts a week could make someone want to quit. Just enjoy the process and you'll make some good gains
powerlifting,37ujct,Metallicadpa,1 point,Sat May 30 15:51:30 2015 UTC,"I like my program, but most of the stuff this guy spits out is pretty run-of-the-mill curl bro ""routines.""  It's interesting to see him try to pitch an actual program."

Yes, it is in kgs, but they have a conversion chart for you. You only have to register your first attempt. You tell them your second attempt immediately after your first attempt, and third after second.  You tell them your rack heights before warmups. You have a chance to see and use the equipment before hand. Once you are satisfied, you can tell them your rack heights.   Of course they change the rack height just before your attempt and do it for you, if that was what you are asking."

From there, you have 1 min. to get off the platform after your 1st and 2nd attempt and put in your next attempt.  Generally all meets are run in kilos, so generally yes.  2--Usually you'd check that around the same time.  After you weigh-in, usually you are instructed to go check your rack heights--then come back and let the table know so they can put it on your card/in the computer."

In that case, you'd check rack heights in the morning before lifting begins. Quick EDIT--this would never be the case at a USAPL meet, as they always have morning weigh-ins."

As far as I'm aware, and this is how it's ran at all GBPF events I've been to, attempts can be changed up to 5 mins before lift off for each lift. There's normally a 'last call' for openers to be changed. I'm sure I've heard it announced on a Worlds or Euros stream too.  For the final deadlift the attempt can be changed up until the bar is loaded, to allow people to attempt to gain places."

This usually isn't the case in local USAPL meets.  We usually don't do attempt cards or lot numbers for changes during a flight. Only a few meet directors do that, I think to not overwhelm the (usually 50% of the roster) new lifters with extra strategy"
powerlifting,37scsl,n3ver3nder88,1 point,Sat May 30 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it makes the meet a bit smoother and faster to run too.

powerlifting,37t6ro,CallMeMo,2,Sat May 30 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, it's literally impossible to maintain elbow tuck on the OHP. They START tucked and flare as you press up. If anyone's told you the opposite they're not only wrong, but they probably haven't even done the exercise.  Try holding a bar overhead with elbows tucked. It's not gonna happen. Now imagine if you had your elbows tucked all the way up, then suddenly as the bar clears your head you go from fully tucked to fully flared out.  You start out tucked, with the forearms basically pependicular to the ground, but as you press the bar up you start to flare them out, it's a natural part of the movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDBBhP0sjUM this is john phung doing an OHP, keep your eyes on his elbows, they don't move straight up and down, they start tucked and flare on the way to the top.  If you want elbows tucked the whole way, you need a NEUTRAL grip, which is impossible with a regular barbell. You'd need to get a football bar or you'd need to look into machines [I do neutral grip machine pressing when I feel like my shoulder stabilisers are fried].  As for the bench press, it's not AS clear cut, but you're still going to have a very similar pattern. You tuck [but you don't overtuck, bar needs to stay over the elbows] to be able to touch lower on your chest and save your shoulders, maybe cut some ROM down too depending on how you're built. Then you start to flare on the way up.  The main difference is that it's not as clear cut when it comes to the bench. There's different grip widths, different touch points, arch height and chest/stomach size, stuff like that. Yes, your anthropometry can make you a good/bad overhead presser, but there's really 'one' way to overhead press, close grip, start tucked, straight-ish bar path, clear the head, lock out. With the bench, the way you're built can make the lift look so much different. You can people that touch higher and will therefore flare more because that's how it's going to be if you touch high, others touch low with a huge arch, widest legal grip and a large stomach to cut down on the ROM, they obviously are going to tuck a lot more."
powerlifting,37t6ro,moldeh,1 point,Sat May 30 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"Is the ohp form in the video good? I generally stand upright to get the weight and think of myself as cheating if I lean back, especially as much as the video shows."
powerlifting,37t6ro,uh--oh_spaghettio,2,Sat May 30 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"I think you should arch your UPPER back and bring your chest up when you're OHPing. It allows you to start off your chest for every rep [and therefore train with a pause at the bottom and have better 1rm carryover, among other things], it's a lot more stable and it's overall a better position with no negatives, as it holds no risk, assuming you're healthy. http://blog.chaosandpain.com/perfecting-the-overhead/ this is a very good article on overhead pressing.  That said, I probably would NOT advise that you allow as much layback as john phung does. It does make the lift a bit easier, as you're turning the first half into a very high incline press, which is a stronger position, but that's not necessarily bad [you might even get better. The bad part is that leaning back that much might fuck your back if you're not used to and built for it. John phung clearly has no issues with it, but your mileage is obviously going to vary.   So it's better to go half-way. Bring your chest up, but keep your lower back and hips more or less stationary. You get most of the advantages without the disadvantages.  An anecdote: I have an old explosive L4 vertebral fracture from falling 1 story as a teenager and I generally need to be careful with my lumbar spine. I basically have quit heavy squats and deads cause my L-spine can't handle it. I have never had any lower back annoyance from arching my upper back. When I switched over from completely upright ['textbook military press form'], I PRed 15lb in a month, getting to 162lb, couple of pounds away from my bodyweight. It's not crazy, but that's a 10% PR in a month without even focusing on the lift. I only did the lift on Wednesdays and I benched with pretty damn high volume twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. The Chaos and Pain article I linked above was a huge gamechanger for my OHP."

A small amount is ok, but as you externally rotate you make it more and more likely that you will hurt your shoulder via impingement.  Using flaring as a cue is different from actually flaring.  You want your radius bone (http://www.kidport.com/reflib/science/humanbody/skeletalsystem/images/ForearmHand.jpg) to be vertical at the bottom of the lift.

powerlifting,37r155,Formula7,5,Fri May 29 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"weightxreps.net was built with power-/weightlifting in mind as you can tell by the presentation of its data. It doesn't have an API though as far as I know.   Fitocracy doesn't even have an official REST API afaik, which is why their own mobile apps are extremely buggy and take a lot of time for them to work on because everytime they change their site, they have to rewrite many parts of their apps. There are bots on Fito but I believe they are based on web scraping / crawling and not on actual data processing in terms of APIs requests.   Creating a logger for strength progress isn't that hard when you know how to work with databases. There is no need for an universal API for that purpose. The actual work is to present it well and make people want to log their progress in your application. WxR.net made a great job by displaying a loaded barbell for your weights for example, the actual tracking is very intuitive as you are literally typing ""{weight} x {reps}"" and its processing your input."
powerlifting,37r155,_predator_,1 point,Fri May 29 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"The logger is actually the part I'm the least worried about. Making sure all that data is getting into the database and relating accordingly is fine. I just am not sure what external API I am going to use.  WxR looks amazing from what I'm looking at right now. I just wish they offered some sort of service as far as APIs go.  I guess if all else fails, I could just use the Reddit API. It's a nice API and I've worked with it a few times before. It's been nice to me every time (except for when I first started learning how to work with JSON (but that long evening was definitely not Reddit's fault)."
powerlifting,37r155,_predator_,1 point,Fri May 29 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"WxR is developed by a single guy and is still WIP haha.   I can't seem to understand what kind of API you are trying to find for your goal. For what exactly do you need an API? For UI? Data operations and Database access? Social bindings like sharing, commenting for existing platforms like reddit, twitter and facebook?"
powerlifting,37r155,_predator_,2,Fri May 29 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"Okay. So, as far as the assignment goes, the only thing it says is we need to utilize an external API to add functionality to the app.  I was kinda of stuck inside of the, ""I need power lifting data."" thought box, but I could actually (now that I think about it) just do something like Facebook login and meet the API requirement.  I'm designing an API within the app that will grow as users input data over time (well, it's a class project, so that will probably not happen in the end), so all the data I would like is going to be user generated, anyway."
powerlifting,37r155,Ferboten,2,Fri May 29 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"You could definitely do that.  When you are using a global database, you could easily setup an API by allowing third party applications to iterate through your members for example, or accessing the best lifts logged ever or stuff like that. It doesn't even have to be over the top complicated.  You could also design an API that takes a number as Input and calculates the plates that have to be loaded to the bar (kind of what pl meets are using), which would be really simple but a neat tool in a bigger'ish project."
powerlifting,37r155,sentientmold,1 point,Fri May 29 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the goal with the user data. There will (hopefully) be site wide rankings on my MVP.

It would be awesome to use for the sake of tracking users against each other and also against meet records that I'll probably load via .CSV files."
powerlifting,37r155,sentientmold,5,Fri May 29 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much this helps but there must be some way to pull data off Fitocracy as there are bots you can follow that will track things like PRs or total # of reps completed, etc. A quick google search shows some 3rd party projects for pulling data off Fitocracy, but it doesn't look like there are any official APIs.  Thesquatrack also has a Chrome extension that will import data from Fitocracy and LoseIt!, so that might be worth looking into as well.  Good luck with your project!"

One of our requirements is to be using an external API for our app.  I was mainly hoping there might be an API out there that might have things listed like types of training programs, meal plans, etc. specifically geared toward the strength world.  I could always take data like that and design an API, but I don't know if that will fit into the time frame afforded to me."
powerlifting,37r155,A_FitGeek,1 point,Fri May 29 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Well I think APIs are generally used to pull data sets from applications.

Those API services provide data like you said, cardio data.  If you wanted a powerlifting focus you'd need access to a data set/API that had like type of lift, amount of weight lifted, number of sets and reps done.  I did find this from a cursory search which has powerlifting meet data. https://github.com/sstangl/openpowerlifting  What you could do is take some of that data and put it in like suggested below, into google docs and use google docs api in your app to pull data.  With the meet data results you can do interesting things like graphical visualizations and what not."
powerlifting,37r155,TheAesir,2,Fri May 29 20:43:26 2015 UTC,Are you restricted to use only 1 language? Can you use any relational databases? If not you can write your program to read off a .csv for your data. This is not ideal and difficult to maintain... but it sounds like you just need a place to store and pull information from. May I also point you in the direction of the google docs API.  Feel free to ask me anything I am a web dev and iOS/android app dev who also has a love for powerlifting.
powerlifting,37r155,NikhilT90,1 point,Fri May 29 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"Well, for our final, we've been allowed to use any of the technologies we have learned through the program. This includes NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Postgres, ActiveRecord ORM, etc.  I am using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) since it is a fun stack and it also is in demand where I am right now. I'll be using the SailsJS framework.  I was considering designing my own API and trying to fill it with data, etc. But, I definitely won't have the time since our allotted time for our final project must be deployed by next Friday."
powerlifting,37r155,Dave_Millions,1 point,Fri May 29 20:37:46 2015 UTC,"Okay so you can use mongodb to store your documents. Although mongo is not a relational db it is very forgiving for keeping flexible profile information. You should use this to your advantage, you can also have another collection to store routines/workouts.  I read in your other post you are required to use an API, maybe you can simulate an api call? Something in Ruby that scrapes a website(bb.com) for workout information/splits then saves said documents in your routines collection. Or totally ditch that idea to get workouts via api and maybe use the ""API"" concept for something else like how to login to your app. Facebook login(very easy for web) google login(I have no experience with this).  Hope this helps."

OAuth is actually pretty easy on Rails. Unfortunately, I'm using Node/Express for my back end on this app. OAuth as far as that goes is another story...  But, hey...

If that keeps up, then I'll be around the low 200s by meet time, so I won't have to worry about making the 93 kg weight calss.  (Also doing cardio every day I'm in the gym.)"
powerlifting,37ryzm,TheRealRick,1 point,Fri May 29 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"I think you'd get more out of technique than actual program recommendations.  First, gotta lose the trainers imo.  Deadlift set up could be tighter, feet closer together, hands closer together.  Bench, you should retract your scapula, use quads to drive your traps into bench, work your arch a bit more.  I think that 1000 cal deficit going into a meet is a bad idea.  Depending on your programming preferences, I would just peak linearly and go from there.  You don't need more variables.  3 weeks around 75, 3 weeks around 85, one week at 95-100 and one week just getting some blood moving and deloading for the meet."

That would be 2 months/8 weeks. I've done it and it helped me both form wise and strength wise. Your form will improve and become more ingrained(spelling?) from all the submaximal(at most times) volume and the program ends in a peaked period with the last workout counted as a meet day or testing day. Its pretty much 4 weeks kinda high volume and 1-2 weeks deload and 1-2 weeks high intensity. Edit: Checked your weight, do the +80kg program."

But you're likely not gonna be setting any usapl records anyway so it's not like it matters what your weight class is at the moment.  You'll increase your chances of losing weight faster by having a very clean diet.

powerlifting,37n2vn,GeneralMillss,3,Fri May 29 20:59:08 2015 UTC,That sounds pricey but 385 pages of information is legit. Most ebooks don't approach that. Agree or disagree with his methodologies you can definitely trust that whatever he talks about has been put to use by him and has proven to work at least for his athletes.
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,3,Thu May 28 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"I actually find this statement very hard to agree with since he and his athletes are so notorious for cherry picking comps which will pass their shitty lift attempts. It really brings into question the status of a lot of Westside lifters when most of them have never competed in a legitimate comp with legit judging. I'm not saying they're weak either but when their lifts are never legit how can you call them champions and WR holders?   Blah, blah, blah Westside sucks, blah, blah, blah.   And seriously as I said above, Louie is an awful writer. I'm glad Wendler and Tate had written so much about it for when I tried conjugate years ago."
powerlifting,37n2vn,farmerstein,2,Fri May 29 06:02:51 2015 UTC,I don't defend him or subscribe to any of his methodologies. Nor am I a fan of multi ply. I just think there has to be value in some of the information he has because there aren't many people in the powerlifting world that have basically had a laboratory for decades to do whatever strength training experiments they wanted with guys that were willing to push the limits. If he's advertising this book as the summary of all his knowledge I'd at least be interested in reading it.
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 06:07:38 2015 UTC,What would you call a legit comp?
powerlifting,37n2vn,Targettio,2,Fri May 29 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"A comp where the judges knew what a legal depth squat, bench pause or locked out elbow was."
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"I used to read a lot of T-Nation and they used to love Louie. That was my first exposure to him and his wave progression and conjugate method. Having watched lot of the videos of his guys in competition, it is clear they only lift in ‘generous’ federations. No pause on the bench and questionable depth in the squat. So you are right to say they don’t legitimately hold the WR they claim.  That said, he has developed some strong guys. Even if you took 10% off their totals and said that is what they could lift when properly judged, that is still some near WR weight. And people like Dave Hoff are still improving, so you could say that he could be the ‘real’ WR holder one day. So there must be something in his methods.  I have never read one of his books, but read a few of his articles online, so I can’t really speak about the quality of his writing. Although if it is anything like he appearances on videos then it will be insufferable.   I won’t be buying the book, but he is good at what he does, you would be a fool to try and deny that. Whether or not his method is the clear best is questionable, but it is good."

powerlifting,37n2vn,TheAesir,5,Fri May 29 12:44:02 2015 UTC,It's stupid how antiwestside  it is. Honestly some squats are high but multiply squatting is hard as fuck to even reach depth
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,4,Fri May 29 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"While this sub is coming around, there is still a fairly large backlash against geared lifting here."
powerlifting,37n2vn,TheAesir,3,Fri May 29 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"I've nothing against geared lifting personally, I coached single-ply lifters and compete single-ply bench myself. I just don't like bullshit lifting."
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 13:37:06 2015 UTC,"I know your background, its more others in the sub that haven't been exposed to it as much. Frankly I blame it on a combination of most people around here having not seen good multi ply lifting, and the IPF slant here, given the IPF doesn't recognize that aspect of the sport. Those that don't live in the US won't have the exposure to it, and understand the nuances of it."
powerlifting,37n2vn,TheAesir,6,Fri May 29 13:40:48 2015 UTC,That still doesn't make shallow squatting acceptable. Unfortunately the Westside really brings the anti-westside circlejerk upon itself.  Also I should mention I was once obsessed with conjugate training and used it for a year myself with limited success. Thankfully I was reading a lot of Wendler's stuff as he was developing 5/3/1 and turned to that instead.
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,4,Fri May 29 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Frankly the meet directors are more to blame than the lifters. Its a fairly common mentality to 'lift for lights,' outside of the interwebs. If the meet directors would enforce the rules set forth by their governing bodies it wouldn't be an issue."

powerlifting,37n2vn,TheAesir,2,Fri May 29 14:03:11 2015 UTC,I disagree with you on west side but having competed in SPF over the weekend and being blown away by the shitty lifts that were allowed I have to agree with you on that.
powerlifting,37n2vn,lqhsdarkstar99,3,Fri May 29 15:16:02 2015 UTC,Think about how much backlash a lot of your average gym goers give when you talk to them about lowering the weight to actually hit depth. It becomes an ego issue that needs to be worked out.

powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 18:44:42 2015 UTC,Did you run westside by yourself? I think westside only is successful in group training with someone at least being close to westside. My training group consists of two guys who trained at westside for years so that's why I'm pretty sure it works for me
powerlifting,37n2vn,farmerstein,1 point,Fri May 29 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"I ran conjugate (based on Dave Tate's Periodisation Bible from Tnation and other stuff he and Wendler had released) by myself, technically you have to train at Westside to run Westside right? It didn't get me very far and pretty much put me off box-squats and DE work for good. The only time I started to get results was for my bench when I started reading the stuff Wendler (this was pre-5/3/1) was releasing about repetition work instead of speed work, then he released 5/3/1, I switched to that and didn't look back."
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 15:09:51 2015 UTC,Yeah. I mean everyone's different. I can grind out reps forever but accelerating the bar is my weakness. That's probably why dynamic effort and box squats work for me
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,2,Fri May 29 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think DE as it was written is still shit. The percentages are just too light. Just reading over some of Hedleskey's stuff he says you have to make it heavier for raw but nobody was saying that back in 2008 lol. And I just see no point in box squatting at all. To train more acceleration in squats I just use pauses. Also I don't like the weakpoint emphasis. I'm a firm believer in repetition of the main lift to build strength and reinforce technique and movement patterns (ala Sheiko) and though I don't mind accessory variations to correct or strengthen ""weakpoints"" I don't think it should be the main focus."

powerlifting,37n2vn,Daveuall,2,Fri May 29 13:28:57 2015 UTC,Pretty hard to deny Dietmar right now.  I think Norway is the only dominating team to have such a centralized coaching structure.  Russia Ukraine and the USA all have a lot of lifters being coached by several coaches.  Its not like some people (somehow) assume that Sheiko is in charge of the RPF national team.  Norway appears to basically be Dietmar.
powerlifting,37n2vn,VladYev,1 point,Fri May 29 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"Russia has a ""head coach"" still but even under Boris the lifters still had various different coaches and programs. He and his programming was just linked to a number of champions of the time. He still has some lifters competing and winning in the IPF now but I'm not sure he's allowed to actually coach them at the meet anymore (banned an all...)."
powerlifting,37n2vn,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 29 15:26:18 2015 UTC,I assume the head coach only is involved at the meet and maybe a few months prior to collect videos and make sure their training is going properly.  I assume Sheiko can't physically help them at the meet because similar issues arise when banned lifters come in the warm up room.  You can chat and get advice but they technically can't load a weight for you or anything

powerlifting,37l8jj,andy33ajr,3,Thu May 28 15:31:09 2015 UTC,"I think the carryover to your competition squat (assuming it's low bar) really depends on your strengths and weaknesses, which in turn will change how you want to program other types of squats in.   For myself I'm extremely posterior chain dominant with laughably weak quads and also tend to squat morning when I get to higher percentages of my 1rm. So taking that into account I went extreme and actually ran 2 full training blocks with a SSB as my main squat movement along with tons of quad accessory with no low bar whatsoever. Then when I decided to do a meet it took me about one month to reacclimate to low bar.   At first I didn't see any carryover and struggled to squat 350x7 (walk around at about ~165lb bw). But I kept at it and each week the weights progressed significantly since I was peaking.   Ended up hitting a few big prs for myself 395x6 and 455x1 (35lb pr) without any form breakdown."
powerlifting,37l8jj,hotpockets0,2,Thu May 28 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"You could run a conjugate style of training. Massthetics on youtube has been doing a series on how to set one up, and i've found it very helpful. You can switch it up as much as you like. Maybe do a 6 week cycle doing different variations every week before returning to low bar in the last week on max effort days. Then for dynamic effort stick with low bar or with a variation that targets your weak points the most."

powerlifting,37mo8k,pinthetestonthe,2,Thu May 28 23:33:56 2015 UTC,What's the exact quote from Alan Thrall? I'm having a hard time understanding what you're asking.
powerlifting,37mo8k,davomoto,1 point,Thu May 28 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"Alan thrall in his APT YouTube video says that ppl with APT shouldn't deadlift, because their lower backs are already tight and strong. I was wondering about what ppl thought about this statement."
powerlifting,37mo8k,kennethdc,5,Thu May 28 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Afaik APT occurs because of insufficient developped gluteal and hamstring muscles (also the abdonimals). Both muscles which are primarily actived by the deadlift. My guess it's a good thing to make those stronger then?
powerlifting,37mo8k,rdavis4559,2,Thu May 28 20:49:08 2015 UTC,Lower backs already tight and strong?  I don't see how that matters.  People with APT having tight and strong lower backs won't develop the same mid to upper torso musculature by skipping deadlifts.
powerlifting,37mo8k,raydexx,1 point,Thu May 28 22:44:54 2015 UTC,"So, as someone who had a pretty bad case of anterior pelvic tilt and worked hard to correct it, and also now does power lifting I'd say... Take it carefully.   First up, I found that heavy raw deadlifting left me with a fairly sore lower back that could be annoying and even partially debilitating for days... I think it stemmed from the fact that my lower back would slip back into the ATP position when I was dead lifting. Kind of rounding out too far the wrong way if that makes sense?  Currently I wear a belt with a small lower back  support every time I deadlift and I have practically zero issues now. It helps prevent me from over arching my lower back and let's me focus on just staying tight. I went from struggling with 100Kgs with pain, to pulling 140Kgs for reps with no pain.  Obviously this is purely anecdotal evidence from only myself, but it might be worth looking into some more if you think it might help :)"
powerlifting,37mo8k,Anton_S_Eisenherr,2,Thu May 28 23:57:31 2015 UTC,Alright! Thanks for your advice!
powerlifting,37mo8k,raydexx,2,Fri May 29 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, in which way does the belt help with minimizing APT on the deadlift? I've got some severe issues flattening my back for DL (basically fear that if I put myself in 'neutral' spine I'll round too easily so I over-arch to compensate). Is it because bracing hard against something pulls your back into the right position?"
powerlifting,37mo8k,Anton_S_Eisenherr,2,Fri May 29 08:43:07 2015 UTC,"So, from the sounds of it, we have a similar issue - and the belt I use helps me from over-arching, because it sits against my spine and pushes it into proper position. I literally can't arch too far one way or another.  This looks very similar to the belt I use - Notice the padding on the back? That presses into my spine forcing it to keep a normal curve. I can't over arch because the belt's there.  So you've still got to activate all the right muscles. You've still got to think about your hip and back position. It's not going to let you lift more than you should or anything, but for me it just lets me... I guess not have to over think my back position? I get down, lock in, and stand up."
powerlifting,37mo8k,raydexx,2,Fri May 29 08:58:29 2015 UTC,Cheers for the speedy reply! I'm guessing you're in a European time zone (or just up really late).  This sounds spot on. Can you make any recommendations of specific models or should I just poke through the guides on this subreddit?  I kind of wanted to hold off getting a belt until I hit 3x bodyweight (about 20kg to go) but this might just make my life easier.
powerlifting,37mo8k,Anton_S_Eisenherr,2,Fri May 29 09:12:16 2015 UTC,"Australian here, and it's like 7pm, hah :)  And really - I'd suggest looking around. What works for me won't necessarily work for you - Ideally you might have a weight lifting/supplements store near you that sell some belts you could go and try on? Even if you end up buying online.  As for when to start using the belt - Well, that's entirely up to you! I'm sure everyone has their own opinion, but from what I've been told and what I've experienced... Just do it. It doesn't make ""Lifting"" any easier. It doesn't magically give you extra muscles or make weights lighter. It's not cheating, it's not lazy etc. It just helps you do something safely, and at the end of the day - that's really the most important thing."

powerlifting,37k1ls,Maxxxz1994,3,Fri May 29 23:16:58 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I9LIsIpsQE  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQDAO_EVCmQ  I feel like belt position varies based on person to person. For example, George Leeman wears his belt insanely high on his stomach (maybe because of his large stomach), whereas other lifters wear it just straight across the middle."
powerlifting,37k1ls,OmnipotentStudent,3,Thu May 28 08:49:05 2015 UTC,"I think the description in SS is pretty good - ""the belt works without you actually having to think about it"" or something to that effect. Cinch it tight, get a big valsalva, and brace like you would if the belt wasn't there.  I've always felt like when I push my belly OUT, my spine tends to hyper-extend. This is probably exacerbated since I'm pretty flexible. I'd be curious to hear other people's thoughts on this though, because I know it's counter to what a lot of very strong people teach."
powerlifting,37k1ls,Dahmkooler,2,Thu May 28 12:29:25 2015 UTC,"You don't push your belly out, you push everything (back and obliques and abs) out.  When I take a deep belly breath, I feel my back expand too.  Sometimes I can even crack my low back if I get a big breath when I'm really tight there.  Then with all that air pressure and expansion, I flex my core as hard as I can.  Then I execute the movement."
powerlifting,37k1ls,AeonCatalyst,0,Thu May 28 15:15:07 2015 UTC,Quoting SS in the powerlifting sub? Really?
powerlifting,37k1ls,czi,3,Thu May 28 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with Rip on many many things, including programming and some points on technique, but I can still give him credit for what he got right.   The biomechanics of the lifts and the quoted description on how to use a belt I would otherwise believe solid, unless convinced otherwise. If you believe this is wrong, please correct me. That's the whole reason I posted :)"
powerlifting,37k1ls,Dahmkooler,2,Thu May 28 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"Placement is very dependant on the person, for the most part its about finding somewhere that you feel comfortable with. The only changes I make between movements is:  Mid belly on squats as I can get the most pressure this way.  Slightly higher/upper belly on deadlifts. I prefer this, as do many others, as it allows me to keep my back a bit flatter, and doesn't get in the way when i bend down. You may also want to loosen your belt a notch for deads to increase mobility."

powerlifting,37k79s,rammstein89,7,Thu May 28 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"You haven't given us enough information on your program.  ""3 times a week working with 85-95% of my maxes"".  Sounds like you accumulated fatigue and now are reaping the negative effects of it.   Just for your information, and maybe this will entice you to rewrite your program, the majority of lifters and coaches run programs where they lift in the 70-80% range. 80-90% is typically done ~4-8 weeks out from a meet. Then >90% is left for a peak.   The 70-80% range is where most people consider strength to be built.   Typically a program is designed as:   8+ weeks training at 70-80% where the lifter accumulates a fatigue deficit by doing higher reps/volume.   This is typically followed by a 4 week block at 80-90% where the lifter recovers from the fatigue deficit, causing an increase in fitness, and as the weights get heavier the lifter feels better and better as the volume is lower than before.   This is finished with a 4 week peak leading into a meet.   I seriously doubt nutrition/supps/recovery methods are what you need. I think you need to reconsider your program."
powerlifting,37k79s,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Thu May 28 08:54:02 2015 UTC,"How many reps would you consider 70-80% as a guideline, 4-6? It's just I don't know my maxes in any lifts right now so obviously I can't calculate 70 or 80% of it."
powerlifting,37k79s,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Thu May 28 16:54:55 2015 UTC,"Go by RPE and don't be afraid to do sets up to 8, or even more, reps. It is a volume block, build mass."
powerlifting,37k79s,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Thu May 28 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I was just generally curious, I'm not strictly a powerlifter but I like to do a couple of ""strength"" sets before doing the higher rep stuff for every compound."
powerlifting,37k79s,theNightblade,1 point,Thu May 28 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"Each ""month"" would include 3 weeks with each week going up 5%. So basically it would be 85%, 90%, then 95%. After each month I would add 10 pounds to my squat and deadlift and 5 pounds for my bench. My goal is to have a 500 pound squat, 600 pound deadlift, and 315 pound bench by October 4, 2015.   I'll be take a break till after Tuesday, that's when I take my last final exam. Do you suggest instead I do week 1 at 70%, week 2 at 75%, and week 3 at 80%? How many reps and sets each week?"
powerlifting,37inah,DrPlumbeus,6,Wed May 27 22:23:50 2015 UTC,I would just learn to use knee wraps. You could probably at 20lbs+ using those alone. If you really wanted to you could use a Z suit which is a really beginners suit. Also they added a raw division for next years collegiates
powerlifting,37inah,jonlwowski012,2,Wed May 27 23:06:04 2015 UTC,"Cool! Did not know abt raw div, knowing that I may switch registration from equipped to raw and then see if I can squeeze in an equipped meet some time before 2016 after I spend a couple months learning how to use it. Thanks for the tip abt suit, I'll look into ordering. Do you have advice on the back of knee injuries I got first time using knee wraps? Thanks again"
powerlifting,37inah,Daveuall,3,Thu May 28 00:47:14 2015 UTC,"The reason to do collegiates is 30 deep classes of everyone lifting directly head to head.  I don't think that by the first year of its existence the raw side will have that depth.  Maybe in a few years.  No diss to raw, its just new to collegiates and mostly the established teams will stay in gear.  Most of the raw lifters will either be from McKendree (SP) or lone wolf lifters.  What is your weight class?  That raw total is almost good enough to qualify for the 204s, and would qualify you for the 183s.  The QTs aren't that high because they want huge classes.  If you do qualify low, the only downside is your lot number would probably put you in the B or C flights in the class.  Does your school have powerlifting?  I think honestly you'd be surprised how many opportunities you'll have to qualify later, even over winter or next March or any time.     In my opinion its not worth the money to buy the kind of gear you can learn in 3 weeks.  You will 99.9999% certainly not get in a proper suit or shirt and successfully be able to complete a lift with only 3 weeks of training and the other gear will be worthless after this meet so why bother?  I love collegiate nationals and think it is just about the coolest thing in the world.  Find a way to do it!"
powerlifting,37inah,marbiol,1 point,Thu May 28 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"83 kg/183 lb, should have mentioned and will edit original. I'd definitely be a lone wolfer, my school does not have powerlifting or competitive sports of any kind. I pretty much figured I wouldn't have a shot learning to use the equipment so quick, it's good to hear it from someone with experience though as there's not really anyone I know that's into powerlifting and I'll have to figure it all out on my own. I'll go ahead with wraps only and see if there's something winter break I can compete in whether to qualify or bump up my QT. It might mean driving pretty far but from what you've said it should be worth it. Thanks!"
powerlifting,37inah,marbiol,2,Thu May 28 01:49:15 2015 UTC,"If it's USAPL then raw is knee sleeves + belt only, no knee wraps..."
powerlifting,37inah,Daveuall,1 point,Thu May 28 03:09:20 2015 UTC,"I realize that, I meant for the equipped meet coming up that I've already registered for to go ahead with it but knee wraps only. Thanks though"
powerlifting,37inah,CaptainWholeGraino,2,Thu May 28 04:13:11 2015 UTC,Sweet as. I thought that was what you meant but just wanted to be sure...
powerlifting,37inah,Magic_warlock0-,2,Thu May 28 06:33:26 2015 UTC,"I think adding wraps if it will help your total (and you are sure they won't make you bomb!) is good.  Qualifying is good, but you want to qualify with as high of a QT as possible for your lot number.  The better your lot number the earlier you get to weigh in, the later you are allowed to adjust attempts, the bigger flight you can get in to.  I was a lone wolf at collegiates and trained at my school equipped for 2 years without much official help.  Its really hard... hopefully you can get support elsewhere or recruit other guys."
powerlifting,37inah,Daveuall,1 point,Thu May 28 13:14:24 2015 UTC,not worth the money to buy the kind of gear you can learn in 3 weeks   Do you think it'd be better to just do knee wraps and then after meet next month buy a more advanced suit/shirt (the kind that would take longer than 3 wk to learn)?
powerlifting,37inah,Daveuall,2,Thu May 28 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry that this isn't related to the question, but you can compete in collegiate nationals as a medical or graduate student?   This just made my day. I wanted to make collegiate nationals as a life goal, but I'm unsure if I can add 200 to my total in 9 months. It helps I'm rebuilding off an injury so the first 100 should build way quick, but now I don't have to rush since I won't be out of school."
powerlifting,37inah,Magic_warlock0-,2,Thu May 28 01:31:55 2015 UTC,I competed twice as as graduate student. Medical student is fine as well.
powerlifting,37inah,Lobsterzilla,1 point,Thu May 28 11:06:51 2015 UTC,Great to hear! About how many or % of those competing do you think are grad if you don't mind me asking?
powerlifting,37inah,Lobsterzilla,2,Thu May 28 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"Very few.  Most go through highschool powerlifting in Texas LA or Wisconsin then go 4 years of undergrad to collegiates.  You can only do it 4 years, so for most they'll be ineligible by the time they get to grad school.  I was born in 89 and lifted in 2014.  On the ~400 lifter roster I think I saw 2 other 89s and 1 88.  Most of them would be the regular age of an undergrad 1990's"
powerlifting,37inah,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,2,Thu May 28 18:17:16 2015 UTC,I competed once as a grad student also.  You'll be fine.  You have to be considered full time but I did it while taking 9 thesis hours (eg no actual classes) and they never checked at all  Just can't be 26
powerlifting,37inah,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,1 point,Thu May 28 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think so, we'll see if I run into any barriers when I submit paperwork/send some emails. The collegiate guidelines (http://www.usapowerlifting.com/collegiate/) say the following, (emphasis mine):   I. Definition of a Collegiate Lifter a.  There is an age limit of 25 years old for Collegiate lifting.  A lifter cannot have reached their 26th birthday.(2007) i.  The lifter may not exceed the age-limit at the time of the competition. ii. The collegiate lifter must present a birth certificate or identification to a meet official to verify their age. iii.    Lifters may request approval for a one year extension of the age-limit, providing they missed competition due to disability, or compulsory military or religious service.  Said request must be made to the Collegiate Committee six months in advance of the meet (2005).  b. The collegiate athlete must be a full time student, in good standing with his or her two or four year academic college or university.  The proof of being a full time student (12 semester hours undergraduate, 9 semester hours graduate) will be provided by the lifter either along with the entry form (sent to the meet director) or presented at check in/registration.  The school’s official registrar will verify proof, with the school’s stamp affixed.   From my reading you need the following:   To be < 26 at competition (some narrow exceptions) Be full time (with graduate hours explicitly mentioned as counting) For your school to be a 2-4 year ""academic college or university""   I may get lawyered about how a medical school doesn't count as a academic college or university, or there's some clause I wasn't aware of blocking grad students, but as far as I can tell the rulebook doesn't explicitly block us and age is the main determinant (makes sense as you could start college at any age). There are other limits (you can only compete for 5 consecutive years at 4 championships) that don't apply to me. Regardless I'm planning on doing meets with USAPL and hopefully reach nationals, I was just hoping to compete at collegiate b/c I squandered my opportunities to do sports in undergrad and found I may have a shot at this. If this works out and you're able to compete too that'd be great!"
powerlifting,37inah,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,2,Thu May 28 02:10:14 2015 UTC,Medical school definitely qualifies! You're good to go.
powerlifting,37himr,nattybber,17,Wed May 27 17:58:07 2015 UTC,Really mellow music in between lifts. Limit the amount of adrenaline so I can get amped for my thirds without exhausting myself too much by the end of the day.  Snack frequently.  Stay hydrated.  Talk to other lifters and relax.
powerlifting,37himr,NikhilT90,11,Wed May 27 19:07:34 2015 UTC,"Limit the amount of adrenaline so I can get amped for my thirds without exhausting myself too much by the end of the day.   This is a really underrated mental skill in my opinion, and takes a lot of practice. The ability to flip the switch to get yourself into a heightened state of awareness and back down again is invaluable. If you ever get a chance to closely watch elite lifters, you'll find that they are all really good at this."
powerlifting,37himr,GeneralMillss,5,Wed May 27 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of times people always get amped about lifts; if it's a rep pr on 531 or something I can understand, but some would say theres value in just you and the iron, no music, noise, nothing. I guess there would be then, to avoid burning out/adrenaline?"
powerlifting,37himr,Shredlift,3,Thu May 28 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm specifically talking about a meet scenario where you have to get focused for 9 separate near-maximal lifts, and 3-6 maximal ones. If you're in the gym, have at 'er. It's just important to realize you only have so much fuel in the tank as far as hyper-focus and adrenaline go."
powerlifting,37himr,GeneralMillss,2,Thu May 28 04:11:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I remember my coach sitting me down as soon as my attempt would be done, telling me to calm down, take out my earbuds, relax. Then as soon as I was in the hole we'd throw the earbuds on, slap the legs, and wake up.   I've gotten to the point where I can be joking with friends/relaxed --> intense/active within a matter of seconds. All the practice for it was definitely worth it."
powerlifting,37himr,OmnipotentStudent,2,Thu May 28 08:45:39 2015 UTC,I can relate as an ex-rugby player I'm pretty good at switching on and off the adrenaline.
powerlifting,37himr,Maxxxz1994,1 point,Thu May 28 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"Some of my best lifts have been to mellow music, with my heart rate at a relaxing speed, no yelling or screaming, etc. Helped me concentrate on executing the lift rather than on getting too amped up and angry and forgetting about lifting cues during the lift. Some of the strongest dudes in history have done their lifts in a relaxing atmosphere and mind rather than amped up. There's this one record holder in particular, can't remember his name.. (950ish squat, 1990s, heavyweight, upturned small nose, calm, wise, pale)"
powerlifting,37himr,megangallagher,8,Fri May 29 23:18:46 2015 UTC,"I would also say you might be overthinking it a bit too, but try to make it as similar to a heavy training day as possible. If you don't take or do any of these things regularly, I wouldn't.   For example, although I don't use nose torque for any training sessions other than to try it a few weeks or 1 week out so I'm not doing anything new on the day of my meet.  If you're not cutting weight I wouldn't even worry about pedialyte or meal timing, unless that is something you do regularly. You're not at your home gym so control the things you can and make them as close to your norm as possible."
powerlifting,37himr,PerfectNemesis,8,Wed May 27 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Second this. If you are not used to eating something, and you eat a lot of that thing on meet day. Let's say I know a friend who has another friend whose cousin did this, and he got some nasty poops afterwards."
powerlifting,37himr,Daveuall,2,Wed May 27 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. Guess I didn't know if I am overthinking and should have everything planned out because it's normal like everyone else does it, or not.  I have my warm-ups and my lift attempts planned out, so I guess I'll just head into it like any other normal day."
powerlifting,37himr,Magic_warlock0-,7,Wed May 27 19:31:10 2015 UTC,"Most recent meet, I weighed in and ate a muffin.  Ate another muffin after bench.  I took ~200mg caffeine after squat warm ups.  I had about 60oz water.  I made the muffins a little saltier than the recipe used because I wanted to not have to pee too many times during the meet.  I only listen to music between 2nd and 3rd attempts, also only pop ammonia before 3rd attempts.    If this was 5 years ago your plan would have kinda made sense.  Every meet was 100 lifters but had 1 platform 1 session.  Now that almost every meet is moving to multiple platforms and multiple sessions/days you usually won't be lifting for 9 hours so I would say most often you don't need to re-caffeinate ever."
powerlifting,37himr,Daveuall,2,Wed May 27 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, this gives me more of a head's up. Appreciate it."
powerlifting,37himr,Magic_warlock0-,4,Wed May 27 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"My ass talks continuously to the other lifters, so I can't speak on best practices. I eat what I always eat, protein bars, bananas, grains, and water/coffee. Just chill and do you, don't get too far from your normal routine."
powerlifting,37himr,HoodHat,4,Wed May 27 19:39:23 2015 UTC,Apparently dumping bars over head in the warmup room is good enough practice for you :D

powerlifting,37himr,cXs808,1 point,Wed May 27 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"You might as well try to hit the upper limits of your class before the meet so that you have more energy. I don't know how your meet will be organized, but on the state level wilks only matters for silly awards like ""best in meet,"" otherwise it's just whoever lifts most in your class."
powerlifting,37himr,Porchbeer,3,Fri May 29 11:55:07 2015 UTC,"The short answer is just go and have fun, try to make some friends and learn as much as you can.  The longer answer is pack a cooler, have some water, some Gatorade, some energy drinks, and some basic food in there (poptarts, pb&j, bananas, etc...) Eat as much as you can before warmups, I usually hit McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts and finish off a couple value meals on my way to the venue. After bench you'll probably be hungrier than you expect. Also, don't overdo warmups for bench and deadlift. By the time deadlifts roll around you should only be doing singles. I don't know how many times I see guys ""warming up"" for deadlifts by doing triples with 90% of their opener and then miss their second attempts.   But seriously, don't overthink it, it's your first meet so you have nothing to beat, just have fun and learn as much as you can."

powerlifting,37himr,thejooceymoosey,3,Wed May 27 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"A mistake I keep making, is psyching up too much on my third squat. I should really save it for my third deadlift. I often feel exhausted and shaky some hour after the psych up, so of the meet is long it times with the deadlift and fucks it up.  I'd like tips from more experienced lifters on this, if you got any."
powerlifting,37himr,thejooceymoosey,3,Wed May 27 19:40:07 2015 UTC,If you're going to wear a suit for your squat/deadlift make sure to piss/shit before you get it on  nothing worse than setting your suit then realizing you have to take a dump.
powerlifting,37himr,AngryDevil,2,Wed May 27 20:29:49 2015 UTC,When I load up on pre-workout during a meet it makes me pee a lot. As in between each lift Id shake a little out.

It affects everything. At my last meet, I fell apart. Missed all 3rd attempts because leading into and during the meet, I had a negative mindset.   Confidence, enjoy yourself, and do your best. It's your first meet. Have fun!"

In 2 weeks time, if I see a greater weight loss than I've anticipated, I will adjust my TDEE and diet accordingly.  My fitbit gives me an average of 2500/2600 cal per day, never goes under 2400, and rarely goes over 3000.  The fitbit is known to overestimate cal calculation, so I'm taking that just as a useful market to spot changes in total activity in a week."

powerlifting,37g5d6,ThrowawayBAMCIS,1 point,Fri May 29 09:04:25 2015 UTC,"Saying that, my TDEE is very conservative, my fitbit never goes under 2400kcal a day, even if I don't move, and more often I burn in the region of 2800 (according to my fitbit hr), since I don't trust the fitbit, I need to stick, for at least 3 weeks with a TDEE calculator in sedentary mode, then adjust from that.   You maybe right, but at the beginning I can't risk it, neither the TDEE calculator, nor the fitbit are accurate, so I need a couple of weeks to adjust and fine tune my TDEE. I decided to start conservative, if, from my measurements, I discover that my TDEE is higher, I will adjust calories accordingly.

To let sink in how much my weight fluctuate, here's the last 7 days:   69.7 69.2 70.6 71.1 71.1 69.6 68.8   As you can see, by changing my diet slightly, I lost and gained 1.5kg in a matter of 24 hours.

powerlifting,37g5d6,nigelregal,1 point,Thu May 28 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"Sure dude, I have for two years now basically....you can do this while bulking or cutting or maintaining. As long is your calorie intake averaged over the week is roughly the same (+- 100-150 kcal), and you have daily weighings (2-3 times weekly at the minimum, only upon waking and pissing and being hydrated the night before). You can look at the data and easily determine a rough TDEE. I have figured that training hard for strength 4 days a week makes my TDEE around 3200-3300 kcal due to gaining a pound a week when eating 3700 kcal a week on a bulk."

powerlifting,37ekcj,Trynds_Third_Nip,2,Wed May 27 06:39:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm....I can't remember the exact difference in weight, as I got the squat shoes pretty early on in my training (I realized barefoot didn't help my leverages). Squatting in my old nike shox or my puma running shoes felt very unstable, I felt like my knees tracked unnecessarily far over my toes and I used mostly my forefoot to drive from. Because things never felt right, I mostly deadlifted and didn't squat much past 115. After I got the shoes I started really focusing on form and things felt more stable. I can drive through my heels much better, the shoes combined with a wider stance (low bar) erased some knee pain I had that I suspect was from weird footing from my old shoes. For what it matters now, I weigh around 153, and my max squat is 250 with a belt, 215x5 no belt as a top set. Personally think the raised heel helps me utilize my leverages the best (Asian so I have short femurs)"
powerlifting,37ekcj,Flexappeal,3,Wed May 27 06:51:20 2015 UTC,I think shoes help a bit. But they also show you are taking things more seriously and are probably trying to fix a few other issues.

powerlifting,37ekcj,megatron81,24,Wed May 27 01:41:40 2015 UTC,"Flexibility is still important though,  tight  muscles and joints are the easiest to injure.

powerlifting,37ekcj,HaughtPockets,9,Wed May 27 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. 30-45 minutes of mobility work before lifting seems excessive, but I do 10-15 minutes tops before squatting and it greatly helps improve my positioning.

powerlifting,37ekcj,greenalleycat,5,Wed May 27 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"If you have to rely on the weight to put you in position, you have a problem.   Uh, bullshit. The resistance on the bar is a (sometimes critical) tool for performing the lift successfully. Purist low-bar feels like shit when the load is too light. It's significantly harder to tighten your lats when you're deadlifting 30%1RM compared to 70%.    For people with less-than-ideal proportions, an empty bar fucks up their movement a lot of the time. When someone isn't 'built to squat' so to speak, they need the resistance to groove them into the right movement pattern. This is also one of the foundational principles of PNF stretching."
powerlifting,37ekcj,tjones601,3,Wed May 27 13:17:00 2015 UTC,This. There's the counterbalance effect that also comes into play. A lot of people can't balance enough to perform an upright squat with just their bodyweight

For example, inhaling a few breaths at the bottom before pulling, or at the top and then go down to pull?  The reason I ask is because I really don't feel a difference when I belt up on deads. Maybe I should try to wear it higher up like up towards the higher part of my rib cage? On squats, it makes a world of a difference but I have trouble bracing on deads."

powerlifting,3792ai,TheBlackDahliaMurder,3,Mon May 25 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"Hahahaha this is hilarious. And true  On a side note, the reason I pull hook grip is because I always felt like a mixed grip was pulling me out of position. I was able to progress up to about a 170kg pull double overhand but eventually it was necesary to make the switch to mixed, used straps or hook grip that shit. As mixed grip was out and I ain't got no time for straps, hook grip was the best available option.  I've never really had an issue with pain from hook grip pulls, I guess maybe I'm just too weak for it to affect me? Pulling in the region of 5 plates atm. I always just think of Big Mike's famous statement ""You can't lift big weights, with too much bitch in your heart"" when this comes up. If anyone is going to make the change though, prepare for callus lines on the inside of your thumbs"

powerlifting,3792ai,AtomicValue,17,Mon May 25 22:18:21 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary. I've done both hook and mixed for quite awhile and I'll give you the pros and cons of each:  Hook pros:   Strongest possible grip Symmetrical pulling (easier on the shoulder/biceps for those with problems) No risk of bicep tear during 1RM   Hook cons:   Painful; depending on your tolerance the pain can actually be distracting while you're trying to remember form cues. Becomes a limiting factor during training. You won't be able to do a 5x5 workout with hook. You'll need to either do mixed or straps. Both of these will feel different than hook. This is actually why I stopped using hook.    Mixed pros:   Can use the same grip for training and competition. No need for straps. Can just grip and rip.   Mixed cons:   Asymmetrical pulling can be a real problem if you have shoulder problems on one side, which I do. I just have to be really careful to balance the load properly between the two sides. Gotta be cool with the fact that a 1RM deadlift with a supinated arm is unavoidably unhealthy for the bicep tendon."

powerlifting,3792ai,bigcoachD,1 point,Tue May 26 00:57:52 2015 UTC,You can definitely do a 5x5 with hook grip. You just need to develop the calluses and pain tolerance. If it's your main pulling form then you'll eventually be able to do it no problem.
powerlifting,3792ai,i-like-tea,1 point,Tue May 26 23:16:08 2015 UTC,Gotta be cool with the fact that a 1RM deadlift with a supinated arm is unavoidably unhealthy for the bicep tendon.   Can you explain what that means a little less technically? Supinated? Why is it bad? What will happen?
powerlifting,3792ai,smnmblst,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"Supination of the forearm implies deadlifting with an underhand grip, while pronation would imply an overhand grip. Supination increases bicep activation, which is great for curls and chin-ups. The deadlift, however, is not a movement during which you want to employ bicep activation, as the tendon attaching the muscle is quite weak in comparison to the muscles of the back and hips that should be bearing the load. There's a significantly more likely chance of damaging the bicep when deadlifting with an underhand grip. That being said, it's still rare, and plenty of lifters go their entire careers with no problems. But you are still no doubt employing a technique that is strictly less safe than hook grip."

However, I've had grip issues after approaching 4 plate (communist 4plaet, 396 lbs). Starting to use chalk helped that for me.  One downside is that your thumbs are on fire when you do volume.

My opinion would be stay 198 or fill out 220 and you'll hit great gains.  You're 20 and have plenty years ahead of you.  A few years and filling out 220 and think of the numbers you'll put up.

I've been training for about 4 years of what I would call pretty decent muscle building training as I've recomped from an obese 195lb kid to an alright looking 215lb one.

powerlifting,3770nt,jonlwowski012,2,Mon May 25 13:20:10 2015 UTC,"I think if your shoulders can handle it and you've got the shoulder width to ensure that your forearms are gonna be perpendicular(ish) at the bottom of the bench, it'll be a strong position for most. But it depends on how chest/triceps dominant you are and also how big your lats are: the wider your grip the less you're gonna have your triceps on your lats unless your lats are huge. For me I'm strongest on about middle fingers on the rings with a moderately good arch at 6'3"". My best bench is quite weak compared to a lot of strong lifters though so take my advice with a grain of salt (125kg for 3 at 91kg bodyweight is my most recent PR)."

powerlifting,3770nt,AeonCatalyst,2,Tue May 26 15:14:31 2015 UTC,Very good article about an often overlooked detail of proper technique: Practice your arch. Every centimeter of reduced ROM at the bottom will result in more weight on the bar. Jennifer Thompson who has subpar arch herself offered similar advice recommending to practicethe bench with a football under your back. People who don't have access to those tools at the gym use their rolled up belt. This will give about 15 cm of resistance. Just make sure you keep your ass down and have somebody give you a lift off to maintain a rigid setup.

powerlifting,3764yr,wanhobbes,2,Mon May 25 06:07:47 2015 UTC,Starting position looks fine.
powerlifting,3764yr,pendrekky,1 point,Mon May 25 07:34:27 2015 UTC,A video will help to answer this question better. Also check out elliot hulse's video about deadlift. Very good pointers.

powerlifting,3764yr,Mijakko,6,Mon May 25 06:05:40 2015 UTC,i dont see anything wrong with the shins. However the rounding in the back is bad bro.
powerlifting,3764yr,Mijakko,11,Mon May 25 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"1) Check out this article    2) When the weight actually breaks off the ground, your shins are vertical  3) I'd be much more concerned about your lower back rounding than what your shins are doing."
powerlifting,3764yr,Mijakko,1 point,Mon May 25 10:59:35 2015 UTC,"Great snapshot there under point number 2. This is after his hips shoot up so he might want to start with his hips higher. Also it looks like a pretty heavy load for him, which explains some of the back rounding but it still looks a little too much."
powerlifting,3764yr,OmnipotentStudent,5,Mon May 25 14:02:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think shins are the right thing to worry about.  You have a lot more pressing issues like jerking the bar, not staying tight, rounding your back, shooting your hips up, etc. Lowering the weight and focusing on form would probably do you good.  If you continue to add weight you'll only reinforce bad habits."
powerlifting,3764yr,RugbyDork,3,Mon May 25 07:09:40 2015 UTC,i think the knees forward thing is the least troublesome in your form.
powerlifting,3764yr,kadoku,1 point,Mon May 25 20:43:37 2015 UTC,Yeah the starting Position is fine! Everyone has different form and there isn't 1 perfect type...  Just keep your chest up and back straight and you'll be fine.
powerlifting,3764yr,scarfsnarf,1 point,Mon May 25 08:16:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of the help. Out of respect for the effort you all have put into helping me out, I will take another video this week and post it on here.   As a side note, the reasoning for knees over the bar being bad form was that it apparently means i am not putting all the weight in my heels, and that I am basically in the bars path."
powerlifting,375vet,snickersbaconburger,45,Mon May 25 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"You bench 175, you don't need to be buying any fancy equipment yet dude. Just keep doing what you're doing, focus on form, retract your scapula, push your chest out and and make sure to vary intensity and volume. Oh and make sure you're eating enough to grow new muscle."
powerlifting,375vet,tules,29,Mon May 25 08:50:18 2015 UTC,Seconded.  Spend the money you would have spent on a sling shot on chipotle.

powerlifting,375vet,TheBlackDahliaMurder,2,Mon May 25 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"he wants to use the sling shot to increase his bench though, which food and continuing to bench will do so. Especially at his age, he stays consistent his lifts will sky rocket during his growth spurt."

powerlifting,375vet,Roevhaal,5,Mon May 25 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"if he bench 175 kg, he should know the answer already"
powerlifting,375vet,PerfectNemesis,2,Mon May 25 18:43:51 2015 UTC,I agree
powerlifting,375vet,Roevhaal,15,Mon May 25 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"You do not need a Slingshot to bench above 175. The fact that you are turning to this leads me to believe you really aren't doing enough thinking about programming, dieting,  sleep, etc. You are essentially stepping over dollars to pick up pennies.   Stop doing 531, it has nowhere near enough volume or frequency in the 70-85% range. Switch to Candito Linear Program, GZCL, or Greg Nuckols Bodybuilding/powerlifting program. Depending on your height/weight a 175 bench should be absolutely no where near a level where you need to worry about fancy equipmen"
powerlifting,375vet,ThrowawayBAMCIS,5,Mon May 25 11:48:13 2015 UTC,"I second this about 5/3/1, the volume just isn't enough for some people"
powerlifting,375vet,catpotle,1 point,Mon May 25 13:39:27 2015 UTC,How about a edited version of 5/3/1 like a 2 week variation or even a 1 week?
powerlifting,375vet,ThrowawayBAMCIS,5,Mon May 25 13:48:28 2015 UTC,"If you are going to do 5/3/1, the most viable option IMO is to do the 5/3/1 sets with BBB 5x5 @ 70% for the opposite lift/Variation. So Bench 5/3/1, 5x5 OHP for example. Even still I think it is sub optimal and modifying it anymore really just doesn't even make it 5/3/1.  AMAP sets have their place, but to make 1 top AMAP set the base of a program just isn't specific enough to powerlifting year round. It may be fine for general fitness (which I think 5/3/1 is great for) but for powerlifting something more like GZCL is going to be much better for most people."
powerlifting,375vet,catpotle,1 point,Mon May 25 14:04:55 2015 UTC,"You mean getting in all those rep schemes in two weeks or less? Never seen a template for that, sounds like daily undulating periodization???  In the short two years I've been lifting, the biggest thing I learned for ME is that most strength programs has shit for upper body volume, and I didn't progress until I tried stuff on my own, volume wise for upper body  lifts"
powerlifting,375vet,ThrowawayBAMCIS,1 point,Mon May 25 13:53:50 2015 UTC,The 2 week variation I've seen is they just took the 1st week and 3rd week.
powerlifting,375vet,Isilrac23,1 point,Mon May 25 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Interesting. Have not seen that.  Maybe closest template I saw was a 5x5 week, 5x3 week, and 5x1 week. Thought about trying it one day."
powerlifting,375vet,HaughtPockets,1 point,Mon May 25 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"There's a template where you run the 3 weeks into one week, Day 1 5s day 2 3s day 3 5/3/1 having the option to work up to training Max"
powerlifting,375vet,Mupt,12,Tue May 26 01:42:45 2015 UTC,None
powerlifting,375vet,needlzor,3,Mon May 25 04:29:40 2015 UTC,I second this. I would continue with 5/3/1 for as long as you're making progress. No need to throw in anything fancy.   If you're hellbent on getting a slingshot I would use it on the 1+ week to hit some heavier singles after your plus set. This will give you a feel for weights you'll be doing in a few weeks time.
powerlifting,375vet,Mupt,-1,Mon May 25 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"I know I'm not experienced at all, but I think it would help a lot since I haven't made progress on my 1rm. My volume prs have slightly improved but minimally over the past four months. So would you recommend the red one as well?"
powerlifting,375vet,psicicle,2,Mon May 25 06:15:15 2015 UTC,"You should give a little bit more details about the 5/3/1 you are running. 5/3/1 is highly customizable, chances are you just need to tweak your program a bit to make more progress.   If you can, get your hands on Beyond 5/3/1, give it a thorough read and give a try to the 5/3/1 SVR (Singles/Volume/Rep records) template. It's by far my favorite version of 5/3/1 and it goes like this:   Week 1: 3@70%, 3@80%, 3+@90% (the rep record week) Week 2: 5@65%, 5@75%, 5+@85%, 5@75%, 5+@65% (the volume week) Week 3: 5@75%, 3@85%, 1+@95%, keep going up for 3 to 5 additional heavy singles, increasing weight and potentially attempting a new max (the singles week)   With a solid assistance template (simplest strength, boring but big, triumvirate, periodization bible, boring but strong...) it should give you at least a good additional year of progress."
powerlifting,375vet,Mupt,1 point,Mon May 25 12:36:37 2015 UTC,Yeah the red one should be fine.
powerlifting,375vet,Mupt,1 point,Mon May 25 21:22:50 2015 UTC,Have you used one? I don't know if he'll even be able to touch with 175.
powerlifting,375vet,theNightblade,0,Mon May 25 21:31:32 2015 UTC,I have used one before but usually only with weights about 240. I think you'll be fine with 175 though. I can get all the way down doing pushups with it and I only weigh 190.
powerlifting,375vet,mazze01,1 point,Mon May 25 21:53:47 2015 UTC,That makes me wonder actually. I'm really going back and forth with this.
powerlifting,375vet,Ghostanus,2,Tue May 26 02:40:26 2015 UTC,If you've got a bit of extra cash then go for it but it's not going to make or break your bench.
powerlifting,375vet,Motorbik3r,3,Tue May 26 09:31:04 2015 UTC,"How many people do you see repping 175 with a slingshot on?  (that aren't 114lb females, no offense intended though)  I don't particularly need one - my gym max is only about 275 - but I really only use it on the very infrequent days that I do accommodating resistance (ie replacement for band or chain bench)  If you're barely benching over body weight, there are a few things you should look at doing before thinking you can buy a bigger bench press.  1)  Do more accessory work for shoulders, chest and triceps  2)  Increase your overall volume for the week - which may mean you're benching 3-4 times instead of 2  3)  eat more and get good sleep."
powerlifting,375vet,tecdocti,4,Tue May 26 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure you get the point, don't take comments negatively, you are young and the people here just want to make you realise that work has to be put in.   Train more, train technique, train sport specifically. Experiment with programs. Pick your preferences. Do it for a while. Change it up. Don't get caught up in any training methodologies or diet plans. Eat a wide range of meats, vegetables and don't restrict yourself.   You might decide on buying a slingshot anyway but it is important for you to realise that the longer you are able to train and progress without any fancy equipment the more you will benefit from the use of said equipment once you have calibrated every simple variable to your needs."
powerlifting,375vet,Motorbik3r,5,Tue May 26 12:42:50 2015 UTC,"Just fucking eat more, focus on sleeping and recovery in general, and save your money. You do NOT need a Slingshot to bench over 175............you don't need anything to bench over 175..."
powerlifting,375vet,Motorbik3r,2,Mon May 25 15:19:41 2015 UTC,Is get the blue one at your strength.  Think mark bell recommends 225*3 before buying a yellow / red one.  And  400+ before black one.
powerlifting,375vet,StrongMoralCompass,3,Mon May 25 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"With the red one I have a tough time getting the bar to my chest with 275lbs, and really only use it with 295+ weights. I have never used the blue one but I would not get the red at your strength level."
powerlifting,375vet,Motorbik3r,-6,Tue May 26 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to knock your recommendation, but I'm assuming you've used both of them right? I'm looking for someone that knows the feel and stretch of both of them."
powerlifting,375vet,Franz_Ferdinand,1 point,Mon May 25 06:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yea,  I've used both.  The yellow is much stronger and and your strength level I'd be uncomfortable using it."
powerlifting,375vet,MikeLucia23,-3,Mon May 25 06:22:12 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I'm looking between the red and blue. The yellow has angled stitching and is a bit stiffer than the red right? Besides I'm not anywhere near considering the yellow. I just don't want to buy the blue and come to find out that it's too stretchy."
powerlifting,375vet,RageLettuceTurbo,1 point,Mon May 25 06:27:08 2015 UTC,Yellow is the same strength as red but with the angled stitching.  My friend uses the blue and benches 300lbs. Still very useful as he can bench like 60lbs more in the slingshot.
powerlifting,375vet,timberwolfe,-4,Mon May 25 06:37:16 2015 UTC,"Wow that's crazy, I'm glad I asked on here. About how much does the red add to his bench? I'm not sure who to listen to in this thread but you sound right from what you've said, pointing me towards the blue. Do you not recommended the red because it simply wouldn't stretch because of how light the weight is?"
powerlifting,3747xv,bikeroo,21,Sun May 24 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"I did 4 once, that was too many.  Now I am doing 1 a year (requiring hotels and maybe flights) and because that's expensive I only do a second if its not going to require a hotel stay and usually that one will be a just for fun sort of thing.  Had nationals last week, and probably won't lift again until nationals 2016 unless I get an Arnold invite and its cheap enough and there are enough people i know going"

My body can't take the meet prep beating that well anymore, plus I make better gains with more prep, not more comps.  I don't think many more than 3 is a good idea but that said some of our top Aussie lifters are doing 5 or 6 comps sometimes... but they cray cray."
powerlifting,3747xv,BenchPolkov,1 point,Mon May 25 00:11:40 2015 UTC,Are all those in one fed or is it a mix between the four ?
powerlifting,3747xv,rabbitsandbunnies,1 point,Tue May 26 23:23:58 2015 UTC,All the one fed.
powerlifting,3747xv,BenchPolkov,4,Tue May 26 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Dan Green mentions three in a year being an extemely high number for him and something more suitable/common is one or two a year but sometimes only every other year.  I can see the twice a year being more common for him and perhaps some others at his level for no other reasons than GPA Worlds and Relentless.  Others like Tee Cummins compete all of the time.    I think if you manage well enough with aligning your training cycles and their peaking phases to meets then you could compete often enough without worrying too much about the impact, though cutting and AAS cycles/PCT would also be factors if you partake in either of those aspects of powerlifting.    Whether or not you have a decent range of meet options near you would also be a factor, whether or not this implies signing up for and paying dues to one or multiple federations.  If you run a temporary high frequency/high intensity training cycle then you may be able to maintain current strength levels while also increasing technical profiency and that might help with the two meets you have in close proximity.  Push/Pull meet?  What is this, only two out of the three main lifts?"
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,3,Mon May 25 01:54:53 2015 UTC,Push/Pull meets are bench and deadlift only. No Squats.
powerlifting,3747xv,amine802,1 point,Mon May 25 05:16:42 2015 UTC,no squats?  such heresy.
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,3,Mon May 25 05:51:04 2015 UTC,You mean heaven
powerlifting,3747xv,absolutebeginners,2,Mon May 25 06:36:20 2015 UTC,I'd rather have a squat and deadlift comp and forget the bitch press.
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,0,Mon May 25 14:06:31 2015 UTC,Bench press is harder and a much better lift than squats though
powerlifting,3747xv,absolutebeginners,3,Mon May 25 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"It might or might not be harder depending upon the individual.  Technique is relative, some people are naturally good at benching and with perfect technique, some people are born as amazing squatters.  I don't know about bench being a better lift though.  Squats are the number one way toward a higher total, your lower body is your natural powerhouse, overhead pressing is probably a truer determinant of upper body athleticism than bench press, and when you consider boxing and MMA fighters you'll note that they all use inertia and leg drive in the punching (and MMA fighters obviously kick as well).  There are even a number of strongmen and professional and collegiate sports teams who don't even bench press anymore, opting for overhead pressing (strict or push press) instead.  Yeah the girlies may swoon at your chest and triceps but that's about it."
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,3,Mon May 25 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"I just like bench better for a number of reasons, also I get tired of the squats jerk in r/fitness. But yes you're probably right."
powerlifting,3747xv,absolutebeginners,2,Mon May 25 14:53:01 2015 UTC,"I started out loving the bench but now I alternate between squats and deadlifts being my favorite.  Regardless, I'm built for the latter two so I'm biased."
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,1 point,Mon May 25 15:31:44 2015 UTC,If doing sleeves not wraps wouldn't deads be the best way to up the total? Assuming the other lifts aren't lacking
powerlifting,3747xv,Shredlift,1 point,Wed May 27 01:30:12 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Quad building = bigger squat and bigger deadlift.  It's that leg drive and hamstring, glute, and erector spinae strength is secondary (with countless muscles being tertiary, calves, traps, lat, forearms, biceps, etc).  If you take a look at those at the top of the elite level powerlifters, many have an off-season phase which includes ungodly amounts of squat volume.  When I run high frequency/off season programming my squat and deadlift 1rm, 2rm, 3rm, and 5rm PRs increase substantially and in relatively short periods of time.  Total deadlift volume remains the same or only slightly higher than as it would be in an in-season program but the squat volume increase by a much larger amount relative to in-season.  What did you mean by sleeves, not wraps?  Wearing knee sleeves during deadlifts?"
powerlifting,3747xv,rdavis4559,1 point,Wed May 27 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"If you want a bigger total typically the deadlift is the biggest of the 3, unless you squat in wraps. As far as the biggest total i mean"
powerlifting,3747xv,Shredlift,3,Wed May 27 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"If you manage correctly you could be fine to do all those meets.  Some people just love to compete and want to do one every chance they can get.  I think 2 a year is enough for me, I need time to recover and get a good amount of training in before the next one.  I like to give myself an ""offseason"" to build strength up so i know each meet i will improve my numbers and total instead of doing a bunch of competitions and seeing no big improvements."
powerlifting,3747xv,dan-o07,2,Sun May 24 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"There is certainly a time when you should stick to ""offseason"" training and doing lighter weight but if you manage your body there's no reason you can't compete frequently. I've even seen Daniel Bell say that he competed in 12 meets in a year, and he squats in the 900s so he was taking a beating."

powerlifting,3747xv,Motorbik3r,1 point,Mon May 25 02:46:03 2015 UTC,I think nine weeks or so it's needed between comps to get a decent training cycle in.

I know people doing those four as their comps for the year.
powerlifting,3747xv,Rsardinia,1 point,Mon May 25 04:49:23 2015 UTC,3 is the max I'd say. Maybe 4 if you did 2 close together 2x per year.

powerlifting,3747xv,mazze01,1 point,Tue May 26 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"As long as you regulate your maxes you should be fine. My understanding is that you should not max very often, meaning you should only ""red-line"" your CNS once or twice a year. You can obviously compete for multiple times however you might want to only hit less than 100+% of your lifts. So in my opinion, ideally you would want to pick a meet where you hit PRs and a meet where you ""practice"" competing. It is all subjective and down the individuals level and ability obviously. As long as you are staying injury free and keep progressing, you are doing it right."
powerlifting,3747xv,theNightblade,1 point,Tue May 26 10:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'm actually just now finding that my training is advanced enough (probably coupled with being an older lifter and young training age, shit's hard to recover from) that 2 full meets a year is probably about right for me.  I probably could do 3 if they were spaced out perfectly but most of the time they aren't.   You could easily just do the push/pull like a 'normal' 2 session training day and do no peaking going into it, to keep your recovery time down anyway."

I never considered it to be the cause of my pain, but your comment made me realize that my problem might be the chinups rather than the squats and bench. I go all the way down with the chinups, which might have stretched my biceps way too much and caused a tear somewhere, which flares up when i squat and bench. I'm gonna be low barring in a few minutes, pretty sure I'll get elbow pain again, hopefully not"

I find I get pretty decent elbow pain if I neglect it, especially during periods when I bench a lot (which is always right now).  Also, finding the right grip on your squat is important. Everyone is different. For example, a thumbless grip hurts my elbows where that solves elbow pain for other people."

powerlifting,374m75,Maxxxz1994,2,Mon May 25 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"Well it certainly did for me, got to the stage where I had to take a few weeks off to let it heal.  I find it can go the other way with low bar squats as well - if you are too upright then you have to support the bar on your hand = sore elbow. Or if you pitch forward then you have to use your hand to pull the bar into your back to stop it rolling up your back = elbow.  Look up Chris duffins squat video, he discusses a lot of good squat pointers including how to tighten your upper back without using your hands"

powerlifting,374m75,LabRat3,2,Mon May 25 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Lots of great advice so far. I'll add in shrugging slightly to keep your upper back tight, and to try to keep your elbows under the bar. Anyone who high-bars has gone thru this...just gotta find the position that keeps the weight from pulling on your forearm and causing the elbow tendinitis."
powerlifting,374m75,swogatron,2,Mon May 25 03:54:09 2015 UTC,"A little late to the party, but I've had the exact same issues. Few things that helped me--   Mobility: A lot of my problems stemmed from not being able to properly get into position from poor shoulder mobility. I found doing flies and pullovers really focusing on the stretch helped. Seemed like scapular wall slides helped a lot as well. Also, do a doorway stretch before squatting to open up your chest.  Wrap up: Wrist wraps, and I use a slingshot compression cuff on my bad arm.  The 2.0 will give more support than the 1.0, and get a size down for some compression.  Grip: Go thumbless, and you should be pulling the bar into your traps instead of supporting it with your arms. Start a little lighter to get used to it, or just practice during warm-ups for a week or two.  Hammer Curls: Do them immediately after squatting, high rep/low weight. Will instantly significantly decrease pain in my experience. I've also found it's a somewhat nice break after heavy squats to recover before my next exercise."

powerlifting,374m75,Rooster_Pigfoot,1 point,Sun May 24 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"Whether high bar or low bar, keep your upper back and torso tight enough such that you aren't relying on your hand grip and by extension your biceps and elbows to keep the weight in place.  Practice envisioning yourself being so tight that you can squat handless.  For some people wrist wraps will help enough, for others it is just a temporary masking of the problem until they progress toward heavier weights and then they find themselves again within the same conundrum."

powerlifting,374m75,hotcococharlie,1 point,Tue May 26 12:56:10 2015 UTC,"It's strange to get elbow pain in a high bar squat, but its probably the same as a low bar. Check your form - are you arms taking weight, are you pushing the bar up with them? If you are this is probably the cause. Your arms are there for balance, your back should be pushing the weight up. Try adjusting your grip - thumbless grip works for some people, flaring your elbows back works for others"

I of course told my trainer this, but he either didnt care or didnt listen.  Been training by myself for a bit, taking a step back from powerlifting to try and slim down. A couple guys I used to lift with have been hitting me up to see how I've been. One guy hurt himself and had to back out from a meet so he hit me up to lift upper body. He told me my trainer continues to talk shit about me. He is saying I quit because everyone passed me (one guy did, and I'm happy for him he works hard), and would talk shit about how I had to piss a lot. I have an overactive bladder (diagnosed by a doc), and when I have caffeine or a preworkout I tend to piss a lot.  So you know what, fuck him. I'm glad I'm not paying him anymore.

The doctors never figured out why this inflammation occurred but I was given a six or seven day corticosteroid regimen and I felt as though it sort of messed with me.  I had severe water retention because of it and a few other side effects and then the prescription diuretic I was given to alleviate that ended up causing me to be severely dehydrated.  I was never in heaven at any point.  I would have stopped but it is supposed to be an even worse experience if you come to an abrupt stop, this is why the pack I was given came sort of as a palm-sized rectangle with a section of punch-out pills for each day, creating an easy to manage tapered dosage.

I had the same thing happen last November and ended up on the opposite end of the spectrum.

It sucks to have such a massive setback but glad that you're doing well.  Just be careful out there as I wouldn't wish the pain and frustrstion I had on anyone.  For what it's worth, I've found yoga is helping me keep myself limber after the surgery.   Actually, it's THE thing keeping me flexible and able to move cleanly.

powerlifting,373pn0,WebOfPies,2,Sun May 24 17:21:48 2015 UTC,Endurance exercise using a particular muscle has been shown to inhibit hypertrophy/strength gains in those muscles. The legs are the main driver in rowing hence the weak squat.  That's my thoughts on the mechanism anyway.

I'm curious about the discrepancy between her deadlift and squat. To me that either indicates that she's not hitting depth on the squat, or else her deadlift technique is off. I'd expect someone strong enough to squat 245 to depth (hip crease below parallel)  to deadlift close to  300. Not a criticism, and I know you said she's a relatively new lifter. Just an observation. Typically deadlift numbers will be the most weight of any lift you do, even from the first day of lifting.   If she enters a meet, she needs to make sure she knows all the rules and movement standards. For example in USAPL the bench needs to touch the chest, pause at the bottom before pressing back up. Head, shoulders and butt touching the bench, and feet flat on the floor.   As a point of reference, I'm 46 years old, 132 lbs, and my best in competition (USAPL) is 176 squat, 121 bench and 253 deadlift. Numbers are odd because competitions are done in kilos, not pounds.

powerlifting,374sbj,megangallagher,1 point,Mon May 25 06:08:41 2015 UTC,"Hiya.    I'm 37 and have been lifting for 2 years, and competing for 1.5 of those. Mostly local meets, in the USPA fed. The first couple of meets I did, I just competed in sub-master division, but more recently I've been entering SM and open (because I am strong enough now to be able to set state records in both of those).   If she's interested in competing, she should sign up for a meet. Don't worry too much about how she will place, just go for the experience.   Personally, I've found that training for a meet gives me a very clear motivation in the gym, and helps me focus my training on improving my lifts. Otherwise, I often feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.   If she's on reddit, have her post a form-check on her deadlift in the form-check thread, because as others have said that's a bit low compared to her other lifts. (My first meet, after 6 months of lifting, I pulled 320lb, but then I'm SHW, and that's not that heavy for that weight class).  It may be that her body mechanics might favor one pulling style vs another (sumo vs conventional)."

Candito's programming is most typically 4 days a week (2 upper and 2 lower). I, along with a few of my training partners, have used his programs to a great degree of success by adding a fifth 'bro day' on the Saturday. I used this to train variants of comp lifts in higher rep ranges, for instance 3x8 CG Bench and 3x10 Front squat and also general hypertrophy exercises like curls etc.   I love the suggestion of Jamie Lewis' program, it's always interested me. I just can't decide which lift to specialise in :p"

powerlifting,371g7p,_chinchillin,4,Sun May 24 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"Impressive! It's hard to tell if you are truly doing anything wrong.  The only breakdown I can think of is that you might be pulling a bit too much with your back when you are finishing the lift. As the bar is about to reach your knees, focus on contracting the glutes to finish the lift.

Pausing at right below the knee, and then really exploding with the glutes to finish the lift.  It will help with the lockout.  Also, as everyone else said, you form looks real good.  The only thing I could nitpick is it doesn't look like your straightening your legs all the way at lockout.  This seemed to be more of a issue during warm ups then your PR's."

powerlifting,371g7p,thejooceymoosey,3,Sun May 24 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'll try not to repeat what's already been said, but you look good. I know exactly how you feel. If the speed isn't there and the form doesn't feel right to you, you think it's bad.   I've had a consultation with Bryce Lewis and asked him the same thing. I think we have in our minds that deadlifts are supposed to always look/feel the same. What I got from him is that you're attempting a PR, and that's a big deal. In most cases it will not look the same as your warmups. It's okay for small breakdowns to happen, as long as you keep the most important things in check (hip height, straight lower back).   In addition to that, your lower back looks fine. Upper back rounding or shoulders moving forward is more of an issue of muscle weakness/imbalance. As mentioned earlier, work on rack pulls, face pulls and more rows (variation isn't that important).  Also, deadlift more. The faster and stronger your deadlift at lower weights, the better you'll be at higher weights.   And what the heck. You're 16 with a great foundation. You'll figure things out on your own in no time.   Also maybe a side angle might help as well :)."

powerlifting,3727s7,raichet,5,Sun May 24 04:24:27 2015 UTC,Speed work sucks. True story.  I think the addition of paused deads will be fine as the programming is pretty low volume/impact already.
powerlifting,3727s7,BenchPolkov,4,Sun May 24 04:55:19 2015 UTC,"Considering that many coaches recommends speed deadlift, it certainly has its values. Why don't you like it? I personally don't think it is the right choice because multiple singles at a really light weight (50-65%) just don't feel right to me. I mean sure it is easy, but I don't feel that explosive when I pull it. Albeit speed work can be done at higher weight (80%), I feel that could be too heavy to be used so early in the week when I have intensity day approaching. I think paused deadlifts done at low volume and moderate intensity (paused makes sure I can't use weight that is too heavy) is better just because I can feel it more. I am not explosive by nature."
powerlifting,3727s7,powerliftinglife,3,Sun May 24 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"It's perhaps true that many coaches recommend speed deadlifts, but I think GOOD coaches are by far in the minority. With regard to powerlifting specifically, I think the general modern consensus among decent coaches and athletes is that speed work should take a back seat to repetition work. Take a look at these two articles:  http://jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/03/25/why-speed-work-doesnt-work/ http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/05/29/west-of-westside/  NOTE I can't speak to the usefulness of speed work with regard to sport, but I assume you train for powerlifting given that you are posting here :)  With regard to the use of pause deadlifts, I think this is a fantastic idea. I'm assuming that it came from Candito's training idea (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSH4YzyqM_c)?? If not, take a look! Pause deads will work fantastically to reinforce technique, while not allowing you to use the same amount of weight. Explosivity could be considered overrated for powerlifting purposes, given that there is no time limit imposed on lifts in competition. Technique on the other hand ... now that is underrated! For this reason I think you are likely to see better carryover with the paused rather than speed deadlift variant"
powerlifting,3727s7,Metallicadpa,1 point,Sun May 24 05:56:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the articles! They make sense. Only reason I chose to do speed DL is because it was recommended in Justin Lascek's books, but I guess his oly lift background makes him a bit biased when it comes to force vs power.  I got the idea from both Candito and Greg Nuckols.  I love the idea of an exercise that autoregulates you to use light weights, AND reinforces the right technique.  Thank you for the reply!"
powerlifting,3727s7,BenchPolkov,3,Sun May 24 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"Ive read from a couple of very good lifters (I think it could be Brandon Lilly and Chad Wesley Smith) who said that lifters fall into two categories: grinders and people who are 'fast' lifters. The fast lifters benefit more from speed work and the grinders benefit more from heavier work.   Anecdotally, I can confirm it: my training partner makes 99% move as fast as my 70%, then if I add 2.5kg to the bar he will fail the lift. Whereas I never move anything very quickly, but I can continue grinding out for a long time."
powerlifting,3727s7,Daveuall,2,Sun May 24 10:21:04 2015 UTC,"Fast and slow lifters do exist in my experience too and this possibly has something to do with their muscle fibres (fast/slow twitch) and also size and bodyweight, slower lifters usually do better with higher % work and less reps, while faster lifters can generally handle more reps better but at slightly lower %. This however doesn't affect need for bar speed training. A heavy lifter who stopped trying to train with maximal force and power would not be a very good lifter, and if they only ever grinded out reps they would likely end up injured. And a lighter lifter who didn't train heavy much would find themselves buried under the bar in comp, but both of these examples are just taking it to an extreme end of the scale.  Though there is some benefit for training with fast reps, specific speed work done at low %s is pretty worthless. Paused and slow-tempo variations aside you should be trying to do every rep as fast as possible to train force production, from your warm-ups to your maxes. Tuscherer goes into great detail in the following articles so I won't bother trying to expand on it anymore myself.  http://jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/03/25/why-speed-work-doesnt-work/ http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2013/03/28/speed-work-not-this-again/"

powerlifting,3727s7,BenchPolkov,1 point,Sun May 24 14:14:17 2015 UTC,I used to grind a lot of conventional deadlifts back when I was too lazy to learn to pull sumo... now I guess I can grind a squat from time to time.  Really it depends on the day.  I don't think lifters can fit into little boxes like 'slow or fast.'  I don't need to be faster I just need to be able to stand up or press out more weight than I can
powerlifting,3727s7,Metallicadpa,1 point,Sun May 24 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some body type reasoning aside I don't think its a totally accurate classification. Big lifters will often still be slower than smaller lifters but grinding power can be trained and different lift technique can vary a lifters speed. I think the main difference is actually endurance and the ability to train close to your real 1RM."

This isn't gonna happen exactly because directors want weight classes to lift together but it would average out something similar.  12 lifters per flight and if they're all lifting raw, about 60-90 seconds in between attempts if the spotters/loaders know what they're doing.  12-18 minutes in between attempts."

If you're going to lift I'd keep it really light and gym time short.  Use the search there are a bunch of great ""first meet"" write ups.  As for your time before lifts its pretty variable, usually they'll split into 2 flights of light and medium weight guys then the heavier ppl.  So depends on how many are in ur flight.  Just always look for the 2 ppl lifting before you ( this can change as they usually go by bar weight loads) and when you see those guys getting up to the platform be prepping yourself.

I was upset but kept a calm head and asked them ""...what they could do for me."".  They said that they will rush the order and have it delivered in 3-4 weeks or I could accept an in-stock version and have it shipped next day air. Not acceptable cause  I need my purple inzer! Also I did not want a ""rushed"" product. After a minute of respectable conversation, I agreed to have them next day air a ""loaner"" belt for me to use while they make my ""unrushed"" purple forever lever. It took 6 weeks for my purple inzer to arrive; it was glorious and supple. I was happy. I sent back the ""loaner"" postage paid by them.

powerlifting,3703uf,TheBlackDahliaMurder,7,Sat May 23 16:50:08 2015 UTC,I had a similar problem and I was able to improve core/back tightness by focusing on turning my elbows back a bit to break the bar. Just kept everything a little tighter so my weight wouldn't pitch forward and cause my back to slump.
powerlifting,3703uf,the_doodman,4,Sat May 23 17:13:08 2015 UTC,I have tried this is the past but always found it hard to tighten the side where I had the underhand grip.
powerlifting,3703uf,the_doodman,6,Sat May 23 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"It is kind of awkward... The underhand grip already kind of forces the elbow back so I just focus on turning in the overhand elbow and tightening the lats and other muscles however I can to feel like I'm pulling evenly. Although everyone's body type, flexibility and shit is different so... Grain of salt."
powerlifting,3703uf,fizzyfez,3,Sat May 23 18:43:38 2015 UTC,I use a que to almost push my chest out (almost like tightening your scapula) to align my shoulder with the bar and keep the tightness. This also helps relieve my psoas. Try it out and see if it helps.   Edit: I also use the pretend to take a shit with glute squeeze que at the top.

powerlifting,3703uf,bikeroo,2,Sun May 24 01:16:27 2015 UTC,I've found that not setting my core and back until I'm in position and holding on the the bar has helped a lot with me staying tight off the floor. I would do pretty much the same steps you take to set myself but the motion of bending over to grab the bar caused me to lose tightness.
powerlifting,3703uf,mazze01,2,Sat May 23 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"And you can progressively ratchet yourself tighter once you've got hold of the bar, like what Mike T and Eric Lilliebridge do."
powerlifting,3703uf,mazze01,1 point,Sun May 24 04:18:47 2015 UTC,"Part of something I've been noticing is a lack of diaphragmatic breathing and a big emphasis on chest breathing. While I don't know what your bracing is like perhaps changing your setup cue from ""suck in air"" to ""fill belly with air"" or ""take a full breath of air"" may be helpful especially if you're losing tightness as you begin to reach the bar."

powerlifting,36zd3h,MN1H,20,Sat May 23 12:21:09 2015 UTC,Front squats
powerlifting,36zd3h,ThatSpiderGuy,6,Sat May 23 13:06:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, front squats.    Additionally, even without saying much about speed of descent, place a lot of focus on the descent being controlled.   Keep your upper back very tight, think about retracting the shoulder blades and squeezing them toward each other behind you.  Keep your lats tight, make everything rigid such that no energy is lost of loseness and the inefficiency that results. Keep your core and your glutes tight on the way down and break at the hips in a manner more conducive to staying upright.  Don't break with the knees first nor use your knees and quads as mental cues for descending.   Aside from the cues it is hard to say which muscular imbalances or weaknesses are unique to your body.  Strong hips are always good, strong quads are always good.  I find that a lot of people have problems with glute activation and I used to as well.  Some quick bodyweight hyperextensions with a glute focus and light plate or kettlebell swings have helped me to wake the glutes up.  More hypers (weighted) with a glute focus and glute bridges have been an effective routine for building up my glute size and strength.  This glute work has helped me with deadlifts as well.  Note: my cues may not work for you, my assistance may not work for you.  They work for me, this is all personally anecdotal."
powerlifting,36zd3h,rdavis4559,1 point,Sat May 23 14:19:06 2015 UTC,On the way up I reckon it's just as important to keep the upright back as it'll train you tp keep from collapsing in the whole for the back squat and with sumos for keeping structural integrity with sumos pulls. I treat and try to emulate the way weightlifters do em in that I do em to learn how to keep myself solid out of the whole. I use the ribs up que out of the whole--the ones you have for the descent are excellent.
powerlifting,36zd3h,Clothingpooper,1 point,Sun May 24 11:55:14 2015 UTC,"Spot on with the ribs out of the hole cue as it pertains to keeping solid.  Ribs out is not my cue but I can certainly see that it is a good one and that it would work.  The way I try to think about tightness in all three lifts is that this effort to achieve and maintain tightness all has to do with efficiency.  The looser you are, the less tight, and the less you keep yourself perfectly aligned to achieve optimal leverages then the easier it is to introduce inefficiencies such as vibrations, extended ranges of motion, improper muscle activation, and suboptimal timing of specific muscle recruitment.  As I view each lift with the intent of removing all inefficiencies, it has become easier for me to think less about cueing and simply feel my body and turn it into some sort of solid, rigid, immovable mass like a rock (though this doesn't imply that one can get by just thinking about keeping tight without also knowing proper form).  For example, the tightness you have to keep in the squat involves turning your body into a highway pylon from your traps all the way down through your feet, you're a solid concrete structure holding up an extraordinary weight.  Your pylon self must maintain an upright posture and full control, not starting the descent loose, not loosening up such that you don't have adequate control of your depth and go so deep that you can't come out of the hole, not assuming that simply plopping down will give you enough rebound to bounce back up out of the hole, and when out of the hole not loosening up such that you learn forward and end up on your toes in some sort of forward leaning squat/calf raise combination.  Maybe it takes some people much more practice to get a mental sense of what I'm trying to describe but this is what works for me.  Also, I just woke up so I'll apologize now for my incoherence and this likely less than cohesive message."
powerlifting,36zd3h,rdavis4559,3,Sun May 24 13:37:15 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Also safety bar squats are a similar alternative, and are awesome if they're an option."
powerlifting,36zd3h,TooSwole2Control,1 point,Sat May 23 13:16:59 2015 UTC,Safety bar squats/pin squats are a pain in the ass but awesome for this. One just have to make sure to push with the legs  and not break with the back - otherwise this exercise looses it purpose in this context.  High bar squats and slow squats also have their place here.
powerlifting,36zd3h,rdavis4559,3,Sat May 23 13:44:08 2015 UTC,Is breaking with the back a cue on any type of squat?  I've never done slow squats but high bar paused squats are one of my favorite things and I see them as a great way to teach maintaining tightness and upright posture while also getting the lifter to learn how to be explosive and push the floor away after that dead stop.
powerlifting,36zd3h,rdavis4559,2,Sat May 23 14:21:35 2015 UTC,I don´t know if some people have it as a cue. But it´s something that tends to happen for many people especially when squatting raw and one starts to get tired. For me cues like hip drive and elbows up strengthen this tendency.   Yeah I agree high bar paused squats are great.
powerlifting,36zd3h,OmnipotentStudent,1 point,Sat May 23 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"I find that in my own mind the elbows up cue becomes meaningless as long as I'm squeezing my shoulder blades together, puffing my traps up and flexing my rear delts.  This gives me a better feeling of tightness and control."
powerlifting,36zd3h,James72090,2,Sat May 23 16:13:44 2015 UTC,Yeah it´s pointless for me too. I would even say negative. If anything I try to keep my elbows forward and in to my side.
powerlifting,36zd3h,Body_Habitus,8,Sat May 23 16:18:56 2015 UTC,Weak quads = hips shoot up by transferring weight to lower back  Weak/tight abductors = knees cave and not allow glutes to be activated = hips shoot up and weight goes to lower back.  Front squats.

powerlifting,36zd3h,imnumber4,8,Sat May 23 12:21:55 2015 UTC,Main problem based on the information available is  that you train at an intensity to high in relation to the number of repetitions you do in each set.

powerlifting,36z5ss,BatmanBrah,13,Sat May 23 10:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'm splitting hairs here but considering the largest federation in the world is drug tested (and lets at least presume predominantly drug free for the sake of argument) then its pretty easy to assume that a majority of powerlifters don't use drugs (taking into account drug tested feds, women - less likely to use drugs, jnrs and sub-jnrs - hopefully, beginners, and those who choose not use gear for other reasons), so this really takes drug use out of the equation of most important factors for ALL POWERLIFTING. And as such programming is definitely one of the most important factors in becoming successful and competitive in the sport.   I'd go as far as saying that, drugs aside, a combination of the at least two of those three most factors being optimal (genetics, time under bar and programming) can overcome the third that is lacking. But of course the combination of all three is what produces world champions.  But that said if you focus on untested feds then of course the amount of drugs becomes a very major factor and, IMO, when combined with the the other two main factors Izzy mentioned can make up for poor or less advanced programming even at an elite level.  I'll address the rest of the video separately as I'm doing 3 things at once right now and am watching it in patches.   Edit: NVM the rest of the video was pretty simple self-explanatory stuff.

powerlifting,36ycbo,jamsoolee,1 point,Sat May 23 09:44:41 2015 UTC,I've had that in the past from hook gripping. I skipped the hook grip for awhile and it went back to normal. I've been using it again but for lighter sets.

powerlifting,36ycbo,Aremah,1 point,Sat May 23 10:21:56 2015 UTC,You have a long of nerves along your elbow and neck that are easy to kink when you are holding that much weight with your hands.  Do yourself a favor and look up some good neck stretches and massage your hands/neck.  If you do this well for a couple of days and it is still strongly numb you may want to see a (good) chiropractor or doctor.  Chiropractor may be cheaper is why I say that first.

powerlifting,36vkie,yoz8ik,13,Fri May 22 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're pretty new to this idea, right?  In that case, just figure out your lifts as best as you can. Typically, people would prescribe your opener (for men) to be something that you can triple on an average day, or hit two reps at on a less than ideal day. Second attempt should likely be a bit shy of your PR (95-97%) and third somewhere in PR territory, (102-105%) just to round out a total.   I'd say that if this is your first competition, don't worry about peaking. Just go out and have a blast. Also, don't worry about cutting.   You'll see people reducing volume two to three weeks out, cutting accessories at about the same time, and then reducing intensity for the week of the meet. It's not rocket science, but everyone is slightly different in how they respond best. I'd cut your accessories a week out, and just figure out your openers that week.   Go out and put up a total, and try some PRs if they're there."
powerlifting,36vkie,Unfairtex,1 point,Fri May 22 14:06:26 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I am new to the idea. I just want to try ""competition"". Last time I checked my real PR  before New Year. So I am frustrated a bit."
powerlifting,36vkie,czi,3,Fri May 22 14:37:32 2015 UTC,"100% what he guy above said. Just like to add that maybe a week away from the competition you can do a mock meet where you have a friend do commands. And you can work up to your openers, which should feel like light weight when you didn't do any volume before.   The important thing here is to work on the commands, so you don't accidentally rack before signal when hitting your PR's in the meet etc."
powerlifting,36vkie,Unfairtex,1 point,Fri May 22 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"That's fine. It's understandable. I find that extrapolating from a 3rm provides the most accurate estimation of a real max.   You could either test your true max right now, or just estimate from your 3rm and go with that. If it's your first meet, just go out to put up a total and hit some PRs if they are there.   I'll second what /u/czi said, and say that you could get some buddies to practice commands and get into the competition mindset, but that's likely all you need right about now."

powerlifting,36vscc,1-more,3,Fri May 22 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"The first thing to do is figure out what your maxes actually are for the squat and bench if you haven't already. The estimated maxes seem to be based on your 5x5 weight. I would be willing to bet you could do more if you did a proper 1rm test because of fatigue. Generally I can do 5-15% more on one hard set of 5 than I can on a clean 5x5 generally do 5-10% more on a 1rm then a 5rm. So, for example you can probably squat anywhere from 315-360 and bench like 195-215. Once you know your 1rm you now have 11 weeks to get your numbers up. Since you only seem to be stalling on the deadlift(as far as competition lifts go) I would just restructure the program to get more deadlift volume. Otherwise, continue to do what you are doing with the following modifications: 1)Always be benching 2x a week and only do OHP 1x  2)Always be squatting 2x a week and front squatting 1x.  So basically do ABA every week instead of rotating.  At this point Smolov is way to complicated for someone at your ""level."" When you stall I would look into starting the Texas Method with the same alterations(OHP once a week...). Also, consider getting 1 lb plates to progress your bench and OHP with. I think Rogue sells them cheap.  As far as equipment goes you should get a real belt, get a singlet and your shoes are fine."

The I'm sure at my grindiest I could do better for a 5rm than I could for 5x5, but as it is I end up staying at a weight for a few sessions on all of my lifts with plenty of grinding in there before it gets smooth enough to progress.

powerlifting,36vwdv,nattybber,2,Fri May 22 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"I would consider the goals to be getting your blood flowing and continuing to do the lifts to keep the movement patterns fresh. 50% at low volume is probably fine. For deadlift maybe even a little less, since you want to give your back plenty of chance to recover.  If I were you, I would probably work things on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but I don't know that I have an argument that that would be better than M/T/W.  Good luck!  Is it your first meet?"
powerlifting,36vwdv,joecbloom,1 point,Fri May 22 15:29:22 2015 UTC,"So is your general approach 50% weight but same reps, or 50% on everything? And accessory movements are fine too but nothing too crazy to burn out?  Yup, first one!"
powerlifting,36vwdv,joecbloom,1 point,Fri May 22 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"When I have tapered in the past (two meets - nothing impressive), I more or less went by feel, stopping well short of accumulating much fatigue. If you like your accessories, cut the volume and keep them in. Just don't push it.  The strength difference from before to after taper will be due to becoming fully recovered, as opposed to the substantial systemic stress of a meet prep training template. So you don't really need to meet any minimum training volume, in my understanding. You just don't want to lose your feel for the weights.  And moving your body and getting some activity can actually help your recovery along.  I would reduce the load, and keep the reps and sets low, though you may not be able to ""reduce"" the sets/reps much if they got quite low at the end of the training cycle (I'm not familiar with Candito's program specifically)."

powerlifting,36vwdv,SnaKiZe,1 point,Fri May 22 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"I did nothing during that week other than mobility work leading up to my meet. I wish I would have hit a few easy bench reps that week as my meet attempts felt heavier than they should have, but my squat and deadlift responded great to the week off. I hit big PR's on both and my hips and legs hadn't felt so fresh in months.   So, I'd say light bench Mon and/or Weds, and if you don't have sore, shitty hips like me, maybe a few light squats as well. I'd probably leave deadlift alone since you would have hit some heavy reps on that at the end of the week prior anyway."

I'm getting back into training after a few years of not much lifting, rugby injuries, kids and all that. Those guidelines are common sense and a good reminder of what I need (rather than want) to do in the gym right now. But man, is 5x5 Deadlifts really the thing? I know my work capacity sucks and I should do something about that but I just hate more than couple sets of 5 deadlifts. I'm ok with volume. I'd love to hit a bunch of triples and doubles, just after 2 or 3 sets of 5 I am completely uninterested in continuing. I guess I'm asking if anyone has any good ideas for higher volume, linear deadlift progressions."
powerlifting,36u769,Burnhamch,2,Fri May 22 13:12:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, 5x5 on deads same as the other big lifts.  Not sure why it would necessarily be different.  And it doesn't necessarily have to be 5x5 perpetually.  It is just a general guideline we reccomend to beginners.  Work lighter/medium weight sets of 5 to work on form and technique.  In the past, when newer lifters would come train with us for the first time, because we had stronger lifters around, they would have the tendency to want to max out....this was meant to emphasize work reps and form, not max weight to start.  5x5 can eventually give way to 4x4, 3x3 and so forth if it is set-up as a peaking cycle."
powerlifting,36u769,blakethegeek,1 point,Fri May 22 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"You're disinterested or just can't continue? 5x5 should be at a weight at which you can complete all 5. If you can't, lower the weight by 5 or 10 and try again. If you complete the 5x5 progress and add weight in 5lb increments."

powerlifting,36u769,blakethegeek,-2,Fri May 22 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"I would take the 5x5 deads down to one set of five, or even one set of three. Then do glute-ham raises and good mornings for volume."
powerlifting,36u769,nimbleal,2,Fri May 22 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"This is something I really don't understand with a lot of beginners' programs. How do you ever learn to deadlift doing only 5 reps a week?  My fastest improvement as a beginner (150-170kg @ ~90kg in around a month if I remember correctly) was doing the Power to the People routine, doing 50+ reps per week."
powerlifting,36u769,blakethegeek,1 point,Sat May 23 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"Deadlifts are so person-specific that I would hesitate to advise that everyone do X. Some people do really well with tons of reps. Some don't. If you are one of the ones that do well, then do high reps. But nobody should consider it a ""fail"" if they consistently only get three heavy reps out of themselves."
powerlifting,36u769,blakethegeek,1 point,Tue May 26 14:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'm all for different training approaches for different personalities, lifestyles, genetics etc. so we're in total agreement there. BUT I would say if you want to get good at a movement, you've got to do lots of practice of that movement. You say:   nobody should consider it a ""fail"" if they consistently only get three heavy reps out of themselves.   So how about doing a few more sets of slightly less heavy reps?  Even the most low-rep powerlifting routines written by top-class coaches -- like Marty Gallagher's -- have you averaging about 20 lifts on deadlift per week (work sets: 2 x 5 Deadlift, 2 x 5 SDL) and a good number of serious warm-up sets. The only exception is Westside... And while Louis is undoubtedly a great coach, his lifters are generally crap at deadlifting relative to their other lifts."
powerlifting,36u769,nimbleal,1 point,Wed May 27 00:37:42 2015 UTC,I agree that you have to do the movement a lot. But some can do 5 reps easy at 75% 1RM and some can hit only 3. Doesn't change their 1RM though (also a good illustration of why estimating a 1RM is inherently flawed). And that's my point. Go ahead and drop it down and get in some volume if you can.

powerlifting,36tum9,BenchPolkov,7,Fri May 22 02:37:03 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it. 2 weeks just isn't long enough to allow for any serious loss of muscle and the strength you lost is most likely deterioration of neural efficiency. Since your body hasn't actually done the movement in a somewhat extended period of time it forgot how to do it to the best of its ability.  Give it a couple training sessions and you should be back to normal.  edit: grammar
powerlifting,36tum9,Keiran191,2,Fri May 22 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on your training style and what you are adopted to, strength might come back quick. It is also possible that you have to work 2-4weeks to re-enable your cns to work well for the loads.  Just keep training."
powerlifting,36tum9,mazze01,2,Fri May 22 09:27:10 2015 UTC,"heres my 2 cents. i found that deadlift is 100% mental. if you are mentally ready for the lift, confident and willing to fight through it (while maintaining proper positioning) then you will be able to lift alot more. If you peaked to get to 465 you will lose some lbs afterwards, i doubt its 65 lbs. if i dont deadlift for a while, i find i need to get back in the groove and be confident in my lifts before going for a 90%+ lift."
powerlifting,36tum9,zeuzbmr,3,Fri May 22 14:29:04 2015 UTC,"What do you do at your job?  the reason I ask is that if your job is physically demanding, you may have pre-exhausted your hamstrings (et al) before you ever got back to the gym. If your body wasn't in a condition to train heavy deadlifts, the weight is gonna suffer because of it.  One of our team mates is a boilermaker. when he has busy days at the job, that means shit like carrying a 230-pound impact wrench up 8 flights of stairs, using that impact wrench for 4 hours, and carrying it back down, among other job duties.  He's strong because of the work he does, yes, but he's not always in the physical condition to train heavy because he's worn out before ever getting to the gym.

I should learn to cut it a little though, since I lose my positioning if I go to low and it morphs into a different lift. Probably let my pull a couple more kg out of it."

powerlifting,36u0mn,base736,3,Fri May 22 02:51:21 2015 UTC,You need to gain weight
powerlifting,36u0mn,thejooceymoosey,2,Fri May 22 13:42:37 2015 UTC,You do 5 sets of 10? That seems like high reps if you are trying to lift big numbers. You ever try doing the 3 sets of 3 routine with higher weights?
powerlifting,36u0mn,jcolier,1 point,Fri May 22 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"Certainly that's as the program intends, and my understanding is that it's pretty typical for a periodized program -- I believe the term is ""building capacity to work"". The other half of it (the 5/3/1 part) is closer to what you're recommending.  ... That said, I'm the novice here, and what I'm doing isn't working. Would you recommend against periodization, and a straight 3 sets of 3 routine instead? Can you share a link to something, or is it as simple as warming up to 3 sets of 3 at say 80-90% every week?"
powerlifting,36u0mn,TheRealRick,1 point,Fri May 22 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"Building capacity to work is great.  However, that seems to be way too high of a priority in your plan.  How do you expect to get good at handling high weights if you do 8 lifts above 90% over the course of 12 weeks?"
powerlifting,36u0mn,jcolier,1 point,Fri May 22 11:25:42 2015 UTC,"If you are stalling, it's time to try something different. I started with stronglifts, which is 5x5. It is basically as simple as warming up to 3 sets of 3. If that's not enough volume for you, do 5x5, adding 5 pounds each week or workout."
powerlifting,36u0mn,danjh2705,2,Fri May 22 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"So basically currently you are on 6 weeks of accumulation of work capacity and then jumping into 6 weeks of 5/3/1 to turn it into more applicable strength focus. There isn't a whole pile wrong with that and it should probably improve things for you. Will it be the ""best"" way? Maybe, maybe not. It depends on how long you've stuck with it.   As an aside I'd say stay away from any lift specific programs like Mag/Ort, Smolov etc, they are not what you need right now.   I was around your strength level ~1.5 years ago and was doing much the same but was also hopping from one program to another too frequently. Biggest advice is pick and stick with one for 6-9 months.   The only other advice would be to start into the programming I have followed since that time. Sheiko's.  For you, I would say to start on the over 80kg 3 day / week 12 week cycle and run it twice before moving to the under 80kg which is slightly higher volume.  They can be found on his forum here:  http://sheiko-program.ru/forum/index.php?topic=15.0  Read the stickies and especially have a look through the General topics on the forum for pointers and explanations of exercises and accessory choices.   Best of luck."

powerlifting,36t5t8,BenchPolkov,1 point,Fri May 22 04:18:28 2015 UTC,This works for me. I usually do a couch stretch for a couple minutes a side before lifting and it really helps my arch.

powerlifting,36rm83,DeathMetalDave,3,Fri May 22 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"I got my coach via a referral from my nutrition coach, whom I found via a fitness site that interviewed him. I have had three separate coaches for my programming, and only under my third have I been really successful. My nutrition guy is absolutely amazing, however, and I really just hit the lottery with him. It's hard to give advice to a first time client, because you won't know what to reasonably expect from your coach. My first programming coach was awful but because I'd never worked online with anybody before I didn't know what to expect. Below are some notes that were useful for me and I think would benefit you immensely.   Communication. If they can't email you back within 24 hours, max, get out of there. Maybe this is my being overly picky, but I really don't care: enough coaches are out there that you shouldn't have to settle for a guy who's uncommunicative. The reality is that there are plenty of people out there who can program for powerlifting, so if you're not satisfied with your coach's feedback, get out of there. My first coach took three weeks (yeah, seriously) after receiving payment to send me my workout, which he then never adjusted. Again, I thought this was normal because he was my first coach, but I can promise you that it's not. Along these lines, the more you can tell him about your workouts the better. Remember, even an amazing coach is at a tremendous disadvantage working online and not being able to see you day to day. The more you bridge this gap, the better off you are.  Customization. I'm not a massive believer in the ""everyone is a special snowflake"" notion of your programming needing to be customized to your every little whim and perceived idiosyncracy, but if your guy is just shoveling templates at you, collecting cash and disappearing, he's an asshole and you should not work with him. The personal touch. I don't give a shit if this is touchy-feely or whatever, but you will get better results with a coach that you know cares about you. Period. Through the six months we've been together, my coach has remembered when I have job interviews, exams, important dates, etc. and made a point to reach out to me and wish me luck on all of them. It's not just the gestures themselves that are nice, but the fact that they're indicative of a guy who genuinely cares about his clients and wants them to succeed. My second coach wanted nothing to do with me at all and if I ever had a bad workout would more often than not chastize me.    My results have been crazy. I put about 80 pounds on my front squat in 10 weeks, 40 on my bench in 6 weeks, 30 on my push press, and about 60 on my deadlift (having switched over to conventional). You will never go further or progress faster than with a good coach. I am adamant about this."

If that's your case I might recommend Mike Tuchscherer's Guided Programming if you're leaning towards an online coach. He's a very nice guy that's easy to talk to and is absolutely in the top of his field. It's worth a look!  Also if you don't want to or can't pay for the guided programming he does weekly coaching calls that he posts on youtube where he answers questions and does form checks."

I hired Gene 10 weeks ago to coach my wife and I we're both set to crush some new PRs on the platform...and we both have hit PRs already in training leading up to the meet.  I couldn't ask for a nicer, more humble guy with more experience.  He coaches many powerlifting champions and world-record holders, to include his son, Ian Bell.

Its been 8 weeks so far and I just finished my test week last night. My last total was 1455 in February. I tested this week and hit some doubles and triples at 95% or above. My projected maxes add up to a 1535 total. 11 more weeks of training before my next meet so I'll know for sure then but I definitely think it was worth it so far.  I have heard some poor things about certain online coaches. Mine is very responsive and has a very limited client base. This isn't his full time job, he does it to supplement his income and he is very good at it. It's been helpful for form critique and to take my mind off of offseason and pre meet training.   If you can afford it and think it would be good for you, then I recommend trying it. I would just caution that you pick a coach that you know will be responsive to your inquisitions and get back to you in a timely manner. Also be sure to email coaches before hand to get a feel for them and ask them any questions that you have going into it."

Saw my grade 5 teacher and talked to her, turns out she did PLing. Got my first coach through her.  2nd Coach: Followed 3DMJ and Matt Ogus and others for a while. I knew I wanted a new coach - someone who was more up to date with training methods, and was always looking for new things/never settling for suboptimal/etc. I also knew that I didn't want some elitist douchebag. So it was down to Clint Darden, who talked to me before and my buddy is coached by him, or Bryce Lewis from TSA. Chose Bryce just because he doesn't seem to depend on bands/chains/box squats/things I don't have access to.   So far so good. Bryce has set my diet through flexible dieting (which I am already used to). My training/nutrition/everything else is written down and tracked with charts n chit through a sweet excel doc.

powerlifting,36rm83,karite36,1 point,Thu May 21 23:21:05 2015 UTC,I can only take away one thing from this: I need to find a powerlifting gym in my area. Sadly there's only one place/club in Belgium (that I know of) and it isn't close at all :(
powerlifting,36rm83,karite36,1 point,Fri May 22 01:07:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was just lucky. I wanted to start training at a CF-friendly gym in my area since they are the only gym within 45 minutes that allow chalk and he just started as a PT. He doesn't work there anymore but coaches online.  I have found the success with having him is a lot higher and it's a huge bonus having him coach me on meet day. Honestly, I think the most important thing is to look for someone that shares similar philosophies for training and someone you can get along with.  It isn't a decision that should be taken lightly but if you find the right coach, it will pay off well."

powerlifting,36rm83,karite36,-9,Fri May 22 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"I've recently started coaching people actually and feel that I could help. In my first meet (after ~4 years of serious training and 2 of fuckarounditis and injuries) I got 260/157.5/292.5 (missed 307.5) at 19.  I self-coached the last 4 years.  https://youtu.be/2QC0rHPN-xM  I work with about 4 people right now (2 IRL, 2 remotely) and I feel that progress for my remote clients is dependant on how competent they are. Like I've been coaching one kid who's made minimal progress since OCTOBER, and another who's gained 6lb and went from pulling 365 to pulling it for 5x3 in like 3-4 months. But I'm sure he could make more progress if I was physically there and he cared to send form videos I asked for since forever.  So I feel like, just like the classical voice lessons I take, it comes down to how many questions you ask your coach/teacher. And I'm largely into the science of the whole thing, breaking things down as modularly as I can (this is why I'm a CS major).  So if you're interested, shoot me an email at karite36@gmail.com!  We can talk about what you're having trouble with."

However, personally I am looking for a coach that is at an elite level of strength or has a lot of experience to back it up. You're a strong guy, but our numbers are somewhat close (except for my damn squat). The experience is where you lost me. You and I have been lfiting for similar spans of time, but I'm almost 10 years your senior. You don't understand them old man struggles! At 19 you can lift like a mad man, have a street taco and budweiser and be ready to go again (or at least I could).   You're a strong dude, and I think you have a chance to be very competitive if you stick with it. I don't think you're the coach for me."

powerlifting,36t7ij,Sbdnola,2,Thu May 21 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"I foam roll everyday. Nothing crazy, just a quick 10-15 minute roll before bed, and maybe a stretch or 2 for any muscle that might feel tight.  On training days, warm up is foam rolling, a bit of mobility work for what I need, and maybe a bit of stretching while resting between warm up sets. After training is usually around 20 minutes of stretches. Holding each stretch for 2 minutes.  But, keep in mind, I trained for 2 years (body building style training) without a warm up of any kind, and no stretching afterwards. So, I'm tight as a MF and if I don't stretch, I can't lift. Lesson learned."
powerlifting,36t7ij,Clcsed,2,Fri May 22 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"I foam roll before every training session, mostly using the foam roller to get my back loose and a locrosseball for piriformis and pec minor. After that I do mostly shoulder mobilization with bands and additional weight (eg. for capsule reset). Bands are your best friend for mobilization imo. Especially band pull aparts before and between bench sets is doing wonders.  But generally I do what helps me getting in the positions I need to be in. IF you have problems doing that, find out what hinders you and work on that before your training and / or on your off days. Otherwise it should be enough to just run or cycle a bit to get your heart rate up a bit and get your mind ready for what you're about to do."

Either a jacked and tan variant or a more classical template.    Either way I'm just looking to get stronger, build my shitty press, looking to train 4 to 6 days a week. Really it's just kind of a question of it I wanna be hitting heavy weights sooner or later and what can throw more effort into. Im sure any will work. Anyone have an opinion?"

powerlifting,36r5iv,HaughtPockets,2,Mon May 25 08:04:26 2015 UTC,"F/5'2""/132lbs, have been lifting for about 1.5 years and just had my first meet on the weekend, totaling 300kg (~660lbs). I'm now giving the 4 day Sheiko program some serious consideration for my next chunk of training leading up to provincials in September. Unfortunately, I have only 16 weeks and not the full 20 needed to run all 4 blocks of the program. I'm thinking of cutting out the first 4 week block as I'm not a stranger to high volume around the 80% of 1RM mark, having ran quite a few months of GZCL in the past as well as Candito's 6 week program leading up to the meet. Any thoughts on this? Terrible idea or probably doable? My main concern is whether I'll need a deload week somewhere in that 16 weeks, which will screw me over since I don't have any extra time to play with.   Also, for those of you who've ran this program in the past, did you adjust your maxes accordingly after the test weeks or leave them the same the whole way through? And how did you go about choosing openers for a meet after the last block, when you haven't lifted really much above 80% for 3 weeks? After running Candito's last couple weeks of higher intensity reps, I knew pretty much exactly where I stood; looking at Sheiko, I'm not so sure.   Thanks for any thoughts/opinions!"

Front squats and really focusing on keeping upright and not allowing myself to cheat the lift by letting the hips rise first has made a world of difference. Give it time and lower the weights/kill your ego. It'll be harder at first because you're not used to going through that sticking point without breaking form, so you'll have to build the strength with that form (and make the pattern more second-nature) before you will be progressing or even using the same weights as you can with your current form. But you'll soon surpass it. Be patient."

You could always try to Benni way and set up far from the bar and roll it towards you before pulling."

powerlifting,36r5iv,devmen,2,Thu May 21 16:19:44 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told, yes you should. One of my coaches says that if there wasn't a bar to hold on to while you're in your starting position, that you should fall over backwards."
powerlifting,36r5iv,anotherdaywasted,2,Thu May 21 16:21:47 2015 UTC,That makes sense
powerlifting,36r5iv,trebemot,2,Thu May 21 16:30:45 2015 UTC,It helps lower your hips and keep your shoulders from being too far in front of the bar if you didn't figure that out already .
powerlifting,36r5iv,BenchPolkov,2,Thu May 21 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"Shoulders way in front of the bar has been one of my major problems, yeah.  That's what I focused on last week.  Must be why i've never felt like falling before"
powerlifting,36r5iv,HaughtPockets,2,Thu May 21 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"I fall back in the setup slightly to get tight, then hold that tightness. When I go to engage the lift, I think about the ""Sword in the Stone"" analogy. I like to pretend there's a sword stuck slightly angled into my body, and I want to push it out with my legs not pull with my arms (they are locked out and holding the bar ""sword"")."

powerlifting,36r5iv,TheAesir,1 point,Thu May 21 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"After plateauing on bench for basically a year due mostly to shoulder issues I've finally broke through. I also broke through my usual sticking point, which was directly above the chest, by doing a lot of paused rep work. So now my sticking point is about 3"" off the chest. Anyone else have experience with this as a sticking point?"
powerlifting,36r5iv,Will762,3,Thu May 21 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"Two ways to adress it. Get faster off the chest to blow through the sticking point, or add in some more shoulder work as they start taking over more around that spot. Ideally you'd be doing both"
powerlifting,36r5iv,Will762,4,Thu May 21 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"This is the most correct answer. Training from ""sticking points"" with the spoto press like has been suggested is pretty useless when what you need to do is to strengthen the transition through that point. More speed from the bottom and more strength to continue past the point where the lift usually fails are your goal."
powerlifting,36r5iv,GrandMoloch,2,Thu May 21 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"This. IME, limited rom ""weak point"" training is almost always less effective than getting stronger at the bottom."
powerlifting,36r5iv,Masperado,3,Thu May 21 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"If you're benching raw, just keep doing paused/pin press and work on developing speed off the chest.  I think that's the same sticking point that most raw benchers have"
powerlifting,36r5iv,HaughtPockets,3,Thu May 21 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'll have to add in pin presses, I haven't been able to do them lately because of equipment issues but it shouldn't be an issue, thanks for the tip."

powerlifting,36qmpj,pendrekky,8,Thu May 21 10:15:38 2015 UTC,"What if I happen to be @ 100-102kg a few days before the meet?   Then you just compete at the next weight class. At one of our meets we had one guy at 222, and one at 245 so they competed at 242 and 275 respectively. Both these guys were decently strong, but they weren't going to win the classes so they just showed up weighing whatever they would be strongest at.    Different rings on the bars, in the squat and bench I always position my hands based on the rings so this might be a problem  Squatting in front of the mirror - I am considering training in these last 6 weeks facing away from the mirror     Take these 6 weeks to feel how far you put your hands. Line up with the rings as usual, but then take a second to feel the width and note it in your mind for every set, and don't face the mirror.  The only other advice I would give is to pull in the meet the same way you pull in the gym."

powerlifting,36qmpj,Will762,5,Thu May 21 13:42:54 2015 UTC,"6 weeks out, still time to do a last short training cycle. Then practice openers for 3 weeks before meet. Yes, you need to practice that pause bench. Focus on staying tight throughout and especially in the pause. You cannot jerk off the chest. The bar needs to pause and go straight up. Start on that now.  I would not worry about weight manipulation for your first meet. Rock up at whatever weight, and compete. You're doing awesome, but let's be honest, you're not going to win with your numbers. First meet is all about the experience, getting in there and enjoying it. Make your goal to hit all your lifts. 27 white lights is what you should be aiming for.   Second and third meets: bigger numbers and you get get more ambitious with both your openers and your subsequent lifts.  Can you not train at the place the meet is held? Seems reasonable to suppose they will have better equipment (calibrated plates and good racks) than your current gym. If you can train your openers in the last 3 weeks at that location, that would be perfect."
powerlifting,36qmpj,nigelregal,1 point,Thu May 21 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"sadly no, the whole thing will be set up in an outside location on the day of the meet.  I considered just ignoring weight but I think I'd feel bad since there's a high chance my weight will be somewhere between 99-101kg.  No real chances to win I know - Some people from outside of our country are suspected to show who deadlift well over 650 and bench 400+ so I don't have hopes up for that at all!"
powerlifting,36qmpj,c0horst,2,Thu May 21 12:41:47 2015 UTC,"OK, well sure. Tailor your diet appropriately. But I would just say to be more focused on long-term goals rather than short-term at this point in your PL career. Good luck!"
powerlifting,36qmpj,jcolier,3,Thu May 21 15:29:32 2015 UTC,I just had my first meet recently this month. Things I learned:   My openers were a bit too low because I was scared of failing the opener. Issue was that I made big jumps but I could have jumped more if I started higher I think. I was a bit scared of making too huge of jumps as well so I made 10kg jumps as my largest. I picked lifts I could do around 5 reps or so as my opener.  Bench press I practiced pause reps for 9 weeks leading up to meet which was great but things that threw me off were the bench in the meet was much lower to the ground than my gym so it was odd setting up. Also they had someone lift off for everyone by default and it felt weird as i've never had anyone lift off for me. Also the pauses at the meet I was at were oddly long for a lot of people. I had 2 lifts that were 3 second pauses.  Squat depth I would try to make sure you can hit past parallel. I had a PR not count but from video I took my depth looked good. I wasn't competing to place so it didn't bother me as much because I could have lifted more as it felt easy but sucks having an easy lift not count. I can't say for sure my depth was good though based on my video.    I was 75kg the night before the meet using the scale they were going to use for weigh ins (I snuck in and got to use it) but it was not calibrated properly so I was actually 74kg and was fine for my weight. So I was stressed and tried to cut to <73kg on my scale I brought. There scale was exact same as mine when I did weigh in so I stressed and cut water the morning of for no reason.   100% squat without mirror. You will be facing lots of people and judges. I found that I zoned out and everything went blurry as I lifted so i didn't notice people and such. If you have a mirror you can adjust bar on back easier to line it up but without a mirror if you are not use to it you might not get in a good position to start and have bar off center.   Created this and has a tab called lift plan. I used this to take stress off of figuring out what weight to lift.
powerlifting,36qmpj,Laughs_at_fat_people,2,Thu May 21 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"My openers were a bit too low because I was scared of failing the opener   I was over-optimistic at my first meet last month, and went for 215 lbs on bench when it was my 3RM... and I failed my first lift. I guess I was nervous. I mean I went back and did it and completed my 225 lift after it, but still I regret not opening lower. Was a terrible feeling."
powerlifting,36qmpj,Rullknufs,2,Thu May 21 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"For your first set of lifts, go for something you can easily do. Getting on the board boosts confidence and is a great way to start. I read to lift what you could get if you get out of bed and do for 3 reps.  Squatting without a mirror is strange. Never occurred to me when I did my first competition, but you are right, good to practice that.  If you train with someone, have them shout the commands to you to practice. I have seen many people fail the lift because they didn't wait for the proper command.  I'd say for your first meet, don't go with the mindset to beat everyone. Just go, meet people, do your best, and figure out how it all works."
powerlifting,36qmpj,lindseycormack,1 point,Thu May 21 14:05:53 2015 UTC,"Read up on the rule book of your federation and practice commands (for bench, pause the weight,  get up call, get rack call). Take videos and post them on here so we can make sure your pauses are good and depth is good and no hitching, nothing worse than seeing a first timer bombing out in a meet. Don't be cocky on openers, make sure you can get that weight on your worst of days.  Don't worry about weight manipulation, just go with your normal weight. Other than that make sure that you don't change anything up last minute!"

Are there any mental cues you use for squat/bench/deadlift that seem to help you?  What are your all time PR's (gym or in a meet) squat/bench/deadlift?  I hope your recovery is going well, I enjoy watching you lift and was saddened to hear about the injury. You and a handful of other lifters got me interested in raw lifting. All the best."
powerlifting,36o0ko,WATSKEBURT_,21,Wed May 20 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"I think every top lifter uses RPE to some degree because I know how certain weights should feel for my body. I don't lift like MT but his system works well for him, and others. I also think he's one of the brightest lifters alive.  I still employ the Mountain Dog principles just using Amit Sapir as my coach.  No cues for me. I train in such a way that the only way I'll miss my attempt is if I really mess up. I don't try numbers that I want I take numbers in meets that my training indicates will be successful. No matter how much you want a 500 lbs bench if you've only trained for 475 then you better not try 480.  843 squat in wraps, 782 no wraps, 600 bench, 821 deadlift"

powerlifting,36o0ko,shortanswer,2,Thu May 21 23:36:01 2015 UTC,What do you think about all the supplements and powders around that were not around ten or more years ago. Eg: Pre workouts. Post workouts.  Protein hybrids. Creatine etc.    are they all necessary or clever marketing.
powerlifting,36o0ko,tittysprinkles7,16,Thu May 21 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"The supplement industry is shit. Before Animal I never used supplements except here or there. I wouldn't be with Animal if I didn't use their stuff but I do. John Meadows proved to me that as good as I was eating I still had deficiencies so I supplement with what I need.  Protein Powder Aminos Vitamins Creatine Leucine I also use their Joint and Sleep aids.   There is nothing new and cutting edge better than good food, and second to that its the basics. You know why steroids will never go away? Because they work... Kids blow their cash on tons of shit that doesn't work and get fed up and turn to the real stuff.  To me you can be a great lifter with hydration, nutrition, sleep/recovery, and supplements. Most guys skimp on those and go straight to the drugs.  Think about it if a doctor told you that you could cure cancer by drinking more water would you jump straight to chemo? No, but guys believe in drugs as a miracle in a bottle... It's not. You better be perfect in the other four areas if you wanna be the best and get the most from any drug you take."

Your lifts are inspiring and you've put tons of good information out there that's definitely helped me. My question is about training the deadlift. What are your thoughts on having a sumo puller spend a training cycle focusing on conventional deadlifts with the goal of improving weak points? If so, would you recommend going after  a conventional 1RM or focusing on moderate weight and higher volume?  Thanks so much, and best of luck going forward. If you're looking for a new book, I recommend ""The Professor in the Cage: Why men fight and why we like to watch"" by Jonathan Gottschall"

powerlifting,36o0ko,likeblumeth,2,Fri May 22 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"You said you mediate in an answer earlier. Just out of curiosity, do you have a specific style like vissapana ar meta meditation? How does this affect your lifting?   I've been meditating for a little over a year daily, as well as lifting in meets. I would say meditation has made it easier to focus on what's actually holding me back in my lifts, as well as help me lift with less ego in the gym. For a long time I would go in the gym every day and squat 405, and make sure everyone saw (I'm only 138 lbs), and it just wasn't helpful. Has meditation helped you in ways similar to these, or in other ways?"
powerlifting,36o0ko,shqippotato,2,Sat May 23 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"I've had results similar to these from meditation! I've been doing mindfulness based meditation for a while now. Like you said, it helps you be less egotistical in general, and thus lift with less ego in the gym. It also helps a little to stay focused, not let bullshit emotions get in the way of training, and helps to stay motivated even when things aren't going like I'd want. Personally I think any athlete would benefit from it!"
powerlifting,36o0ko,fitphysics,2,Sat May 23 18:57:20 2015 UTC,"hey brandon, i think i already know the answer to this but i want to ask anyway:  I enjoy squatting and have worked my way up to a measly 425lbs at 180lbs bw. Conversely, I hate deadlifting, my grip sucks, i feel like a pussy doing it with 315-365 lbs so i often avoid the lift altogether (i.e. it's been like 4 months since I've deadlifted). Instead, I've been benching, pressing, squatting and doing rows/pullups almost every other day. I don't know if my forms not dialed in but i just don't get the same primitive, intense feeling that some others do just picking up heavy shit. I get that high from everything else where the form follows just ""feeling"" it, but deadlifting feels so weirdly technical.  I need to suck it up and start picking up heavy shit, right?"

powerlifting,36mcqw,AbsoluteOs,-1,Wed May 20 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"What about Sumo deadlift then? Or just genetics, The different ROM between a long-arm person and a short-arm person is just insane. Especially if the long-armed one goes sumo as well. Consider Richard Hawthorne's ROM on the DL, it's short as fuarck."
powerlifting,36mcqw,cazzah123,-4,Wed May 20 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but his ROM is short as fuck because his body is built like that. I dont like all the excessive back arches you see, not to mention a guy that weighs 180lbs is obviously going to have a bigger rom on the bench than some of these 300+lbs dudes."
powerlifting,36mcqw,AbsoluteOs,5,Wed May 20 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true, and I don't fault you for thinking that. But I honestly think the ROM differences in the DL are much bigger and impactful that one ones on the bench.   Besides, arguably arching is just ""how they're built"" as well. Flexibility like that isn't something you can easily acquire, and might even be physically impossible for you."

powerlifting,36n09c,stalegrapes,58,Wed May 20 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"Man I could not agree more on this. I like to think I hold my lifts to a certain standard, the same standard I expect to see from other big lifters. I've had meets where I've had a squat passed that after watching the video later appears high. It bothers me watching it and expect myself to do better. As a lifter I should be my biggest critic, I should be able to look at my lifts and know it was sloppy, high, touch n go, hitched, etc. It's how you get better by refining the movements making them perfect. Not only that when I hit a big lift in a competition I want it to be unquestionably good. Last December I had my second attempt squat red lighted for depth, it was easy I had another 30-40lbs in me. I made the choice to take 840 again because I'd rather have a picture perfect 840lb competition squat than an 880 that's a questionable/high gift.   Also if you're going to film your lifts you should expect a certain amount of criticism. There is always something you can improve on. Of course there will always be people who are dicks just to be a dick but arguing and calling them ""haters"" just let's them know they are getting to you.  Edit: I want to add to this that I can sort of understand how defensive people can be. Especially when they've been lifting for 10 years working hard week in and week out. It sucks to have someone tell you it could have been better etc. That doesn't mean you get to disregard all comments just because other people aren't as strong as you.   Basically if a lift is executed poorly, own it, fix it next time."

The guys that have put in their time and have the 1700+ totals never talk shit about other lifts getting passed.   The biggest thing I've noticed with online depth calling is people having issues with front view calls because of the size of an elite lifters legs. They look in the wrong spot and jump to a conclusion that the lift is super high when in reality the judge has a perfect view and can make a much more informed call. Hell even seeing a second video of Kallas' 711 show's it being much deeper than what I saw on the original video.
powerlifting,36n09c,bigcoachD,7,Wed May 20 19:19:52 2015 UTC,This is why weightlifting is more fun to watch.   Much easier to say if a lift was completed or not
powerlifting,36n09c,what_the_actual_luck,13,Wed May 20 17:41:49 2015 UTC,"Meh, that's not exactly true. There are many small errors that can be made that are very hard to spot for the untrained eye, e.g. slightly bent elbows at lockout, and things like that. If you browse weightlifting subs you'll see it brought up now and then that they should allow small press-outs, but it's usually shutdown with the safety argument."
powerlifting,36n09c,AbsoluteOs,1 point,Wed May 20 18:23:47 2015 UTC,One of the errors I always miss is elbows brushing the knees on a clean - I can usually catch a press-out first time; always miss elbows brushing knees until the replay!

powerlifting,36n09c,MixedWithFruit,9,Thu May 21 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Nice rant...   Is it so bad to want some sort of standard in this sport?   For starters, we have different federations because no one can agree on anything in this sport. What's raw? Is it with or without knee wraps? Whats depth? Hip crease at, or hip crease below knee? Flat foot benching only? ect   Is it so bad to simply want the lifts to be performed within the constructs of the rule books   That's why federations have judges. The biggest issue I see with people talking about high squats this and high squats that, they're generally looking at the front view. A great example was Sam Byrd's world record squat a few months ago. From the front it looked high, but the side angle showed he hit depth."
powerlifting,36n09c,TheAesir,2,Wed May 20 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that I really only try to worry about what I'm doing, unless someone specifically asks for feedback.  I'm not going to call anyone out, or ding any federations that have shown 'lax' calls on squat depth.  The judges are people and make mistakes too.  I know that where I primarily compete doesn't give gifts like what you're describing in the first place, and I've had squats that I thought were to depth red lighted.  They will err on the side of a red light if it's borderline more often than not, and I'm ok with those strict standards.  Not unlike /u/Mdisbrow (except that he's much bigger and stronger than me) I know what standards I want my squats to look like, and my lifts to pass on.  If I can meet those standards, I know I'll get 3 whites so it doesn't matter to me."
powerlifting,36n09c,theNightblade,2,Thu May 21 12:00:58 2015 UTC,I was going to agree wholeheartedly but then I remembered that I have more than once torn the shit out of a lifter or fed for lax standards.   So I suppose I'll just have to agree in sentiment to avoid being too hypocritical.

Pick a fairer FED, since some don't care too much about depth being spot on.  If it was a gym lift it doesn't matter.  I used to be concerned about other people's depth, but it doesn't matter.  I would never now suggest someone else's lift was high unless they ask my opinion in which case they will get it straight.  EDIT: However I am happy to criticize pro lifters or youtube celebrities since that's basically their job.  I just don't comment on my friends lifting.  Sometimes I squat a bit high in training depending how my hips feel, I don't panic about it."
powerlifting,36n09c,Eatsshootsdeadlifts,1 point,Wed May 20 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"I think the key to your statements is the idea of friends doing their friends favors, and whether that's fair.  Apart from that, the system by design will let a few bad lifts squeak through from time to time, and there are no take backs; and that goes for everybody, including someone pointing out a lifts flaws.  What I'm saying is it's an imperfect system but it's imperfect for everyone, no one is being left out, so taking the time to publicly criticize a bad lift that passed serves absolutely no purpose other than to take away from the lifters accomplishment; it won't fix the bad call, it won't remove the record, it won't prevent future mistakes, it serves no other purpose. That's hating.  Whether friends helping out friends with lax judging is a problem, and whether standards ought to be way tighter to prevent this and even the playing field, yes, IPF."

powerlifting,36q4ir,noname676,9,Thu May 21 06:07:18 2015 UTC,"Because it sounds like you're a beginner, you may want to look at a beginner weightlifting program, like Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength (I personally ran with Stronglifts). They're not exactly powerlifting centric routines, but they allow you to get strong quick if you're new to lifting and get comfortable with the exercises.   I personally got into powerlifting in high school, mainly because the school I transferred to didn't have a wrestling program. I was 17 when I started and struggled to squat a plate (that's 135 lbs), now I can confidently hit 485 lbs. A few years of hard work will make you very strong.  If you're not wanting to compete because you think you won't do well, don't worry about it. Meets can actually be really fun and you can meet some cool people. I made the mistake holding off on competing because I didn't think I'd be good enough. The motivation I got from competing in my first meet outside of high school made me a lot stronger for the next meet. Just have to go for it. You can look for meets in your area at powerliftingwatch.com."
powerlifting,36q4ir,ToastedWonder,10,Thu May 21 06:32:40 2015 UTC,"I actually am diagnosed with Crohn's Disease myself. Got diagnosed when I was in my senior year of high school. Took me from 217 to 147 in the course of eight months, until I got put on adalimumab.  Starting with powerlifting in college helped bring me back to a healthy point in life.  The best place to start, personally, was definitely getting some sort of accountability partner. It was far too easy for me to write off going to the gym or eating right due to a flare up or bowel trouble. However, my brother encouraged me to go with him, even if only for a half hour here and there. He pushed me to maintain, and that's where my habits developed. My university started a small powerlifting club a year after I had gotten back into lifting, and I started competing then."
powerlifting,36q4ir,Magic_warlock0-,2,Thu May 21 11:20:38 2015 UTC,"I got into powerlifting through a friend of mine who introduced me to the PL gym that i go to now. I am very competitive and wanted a sport that i could easily get into & make new friends with similar interests (being strong). Since then ive gotten strong as F and everyone at Orlando Barbell is like my extended family. When i first started i did this 6 or 12 (i forgot) powerbuilding program from Mike O hern on BB.com where i got a good amount of beginner gains and then i did 5/3/1 for a year, and currently run Brian Schwabs minimalist method. I hear alot of people starting off with starting strength, but regardless of what program you choose, id say stick with it for a year, maybe a bit less. I just say this because it seems like everyone new will say ""oh (insert program name) doesnt work, ive been doing it a whole 6 weeks waaah"" but when youre new you dont know what your body responds well to or anything to begin with, stick to it and the gainz will come. Minor tweaks to a program can help later as you progress. Hope that helped"

In regards to how to get started, I'd say more important than your programming, you need instruction.  You need someone with a trained eye to look at you and help you figure out what you need to focus on and if you're able to jump right in and get to the heavy end of things or if you need to develop a certain muscle group(s) before you start going full-board!  We can definitely help you on here if you were to get some videos on here, we can critique and offer suggestions and all that jazz, however it is more ideal to have someone with you in person!  So I say look around for a decent barbell/powerlifting club/gym and get yourself some quality first-hand instruction.  Good luck and welcome to the club!!"

Although its more for fitness than competing you shouldn't worry too much about. I know its a little different for everyone but when you have flair ups we don't exceed 70% as its normally destroyed her core stability and energy.

I want the last week to end with singles (or close... 2...3 max)  because I want to somewhat guess on what numbers I'll be testing my next makes at (last time I tested a deadlift was at 140kg, I have done 147.5kgx5...).  Does that make sense?   And for week two, I'm optimistic about getting more reps than 1 in all lifts except the OHP, which I care less about.   Again, does this make sense?

powerlifting,36oni4,czi,1 point,Thu May 21 06:54:05 2015 UTC,I would still recommend doing the 5 and 3 weeks instead. You can test your max afterwards if you still feel strong after the main lifts.  Edit: Or just use the real 5/3/1 if you want it 4 weeks.

powerlifting,36ncl1,MasteronAndCommander,6,Wed May 20 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"I like squatting as often as possible and I have pretty big legs for someone my size. Tennis players play tennis everyday and they have one huge forearm.  I think high frequency can build muscle for sure, but is it optimal from a size standpoint? Probably not. Trashing the muscle every few days with large amounts of volume seems to be the way to go for that, as demonstrated by bodybuilders."
powerlifting,36ncl1,ape288,5,Wed May 20 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"I ran a high frequency high intensity squat cycle last year, saw 40lb increase in squat in ten weeks.  I'm currently running the cycle again but I added in bench as well.  It's a little different this time because of the inclusion of bench and because the last cycle was all sumo deadlifts while this one is all conventional.  That being said, I've increased my high bar by 30lbs so far and I'm 5lbs away from my low bar 1rm, added 20lbs to my bench, 20lbs to OHP (and that was a single versus my 20lb increase was a double), deadlift 3rm and 5rm PRs and within 35lbs and 45lbs of my all time PR, respectively.  Front squat 3rm PR and within 25lbs of my 1rm all time PR.  In both cycles I did pack on a lot of muscle.    Additionally, the research referenced in this recent article seems to support equal amounts of hypertrophy for low and high frequency lifters under specific conditions: http://www.strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/ My total volumes for each week aren't far off from lower frequency training but the increased frequency and thus practice does help me.  I'd posit that I'm genetically predisposed toward higher frequency as being the optimal solution for my own training results but not everyone is the same.    I'm 213lbs, ~14.5%bf, 5'8"" and though I'm not huge nor exceedingly aesthetic I still am one of the most thick and jacked people I've ever seen at the few gyms I go to.  I'm not being boastful, even each gym and the individuals within it are factors that play into how relatively large you see yourself as being.  That being said, I do experience significant lean tissue size increases with high frequency.  Only one other person around me employs high frequency and he is entirely the opposite, quite a stealthy beast whose front squat 1rm is 375 @ 196.  Take away from this what you will. I'm not saying this method is right or wrong, just that it works for me and that yes, for my own body induces hypertrophy quite satisfactorily and strength as well."

powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,4,Thu May 21 01:49:17 2015 UTC,"I'll do you one better, I've laid out my template here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9k1te3z4a7wbc5o/HIHF_template_2015-05-20.xlsx?dl=0  Note:    The original programming specific to squatting (type of squat, frequency, intensity, rep/set scheme, and backdown methodology came from Dan Green while I trained under him.  I did add the final set of 10 reps as my own and the specific weights used while ascending toward the top squat sets are also based on my own warmup requirements.  Some people take larger jumps than I and some smaller. This was also originally a five day program but for the sake of shorter sessions each day and because I incorporated high frequency bench press logic, I spread things out over seven days. There are significant commonalities between the assistance and accessory work contained within this program and the original from Dan but as Dan has not released his programming to the general public, what you see in my template is as specific as I'll get and differences do still exist.  Additionally, running conventional rather than sumo deadlifts widens the variance. Although the nine months of my bastardized 5/3/1 routine prior to training under Dan held a good amount of volume, one would find that training under Dan holds even more.  I came from a bodybuilding background so a sudden increase in traiing volume hardly affected me and as I do well with intensity, high frequency, high volume, and even all three of these combined, I have not had any issues with recovery.  Others might view this template and see the overall workload as too much but it's all relative."

powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,1 point,Thu May 21 17:31:28 2015 UTC,I actually respond very well to this setup rather than once a week with equal 3x5 main sets and the assistance sets afterward.
powerlifting,36ncl1,Daveuall,1 point,Thu May 21 19:46:35 2015 UTC,I could see that. Deadlift volume in general just makes me sad because I'm a giant wimp. Ran Mag-Ort with great success and wanted to die every week during the 4x4.
powerlifting,36ncl1,ItsJotaPe,1 point,Thu May 21 20:13:16 2015 UTC,I personally prefer the second deadlift day of mine with heavier weight for sets of three reps on the conventional deads off the floor despite this day starting first with squats because sets of three tear up my hands less and obviously heavier weight is much more fun at least for me.
powerlifting,36ncl1,Daveuall,3,Thu May 21 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"It seems to be getting more popular around the internet. I did it for a few months back in the height of the Broz hype (early 2011?).  Squat went down from 501 to about 440 but front squat went up from ~0 to 385 during that time.  Eventually I stopped because I wasn't enjoying myself and there was no excitement when trying to make  a lift when I could just try again the next day.  I've done 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 7x, and 10x a week squatting.  Currently back to 2x.  I think Russian or Norwegian, or American DUP models are a better answer."
powerlifting,36ncl1,ItsJotaPe,2,Wed May 20 18:42:52 2015 UTC,Your squat went down squatting ten times a week?  How?
powerlifting,36ncl1,BeauBrandon,2,Thu May 21 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I guess it could be a hundred things.  It was below freezing in my garage most days I was squatting, I was too focused on quantity instead of quality, I genuinely fell out of love with squatting and it became a chore I had to do instead of something I looked forward to.  Honestly this was in 2010 and 2011 so all I can go by is the numbers i have recorded I can't remember how I was feeling that well"
powerlifting,36ncl1,dennistheasian,1 point,Thu May 21 13:04:46 2015 UTC,it became a chore I had to do instead of something I looked forward to.   That makes sense. The mental aspects of lifting weights are not discussed near enough in my opinion.

powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,2,Thu May 21 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"I've done it for the past year, I've experienced some excellent growth under this particular program (385->455 beltless squats).  As for growth, my biceps have grown a ton, shoulders have grown a ton, and quads have bumped my jeans out of the closet."
powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,3,Wed May 20 18:04:19 2015 UTC,How do you get in the work you need to grow your shoulders and biceps without hampering your recovery for the next day?
powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,1 point,Wed May 20 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Mm, not entirely sure what you mean by this, but I do a ton of band pull aparts for rear delt work.  I have one of the pink elite fts bands and I do about 1000 before bed, do 100-500 while my chicken is cooking/reheating and pullups during work hours.    I keep it fairly high volume for shoulder work."
powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,1 point,Wed May 20 21:51:05 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I was trying to ask what kind of assistance work you did but I guess failed epicly. Did you do anything else?
powerlifting,36ncl1,Chicksan,2,Thu May 21 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"Your username, I see what you did there.  All I could come up with in response is AnavarKarenina and PrincessDianabolOfWales."
powerlifting,36ncl1,rdavis4559,2,Thu May 21 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"Hahaha those are both great, don't sell yourself short."
powerlifting,36ncl1,Arve,1 point,Thu May 21 17:30:35 2015 UTC,insert joke about napoleon's height
powerlifting,36ncl1,jthorntonj,1 point,Thu May 21 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"My shoulder work is also pretty high volume.  In answer to MasteronAndCommander, I only have a single day where I do EZ-bar curls for a 4x12 then two drop sets for 12 reps each, dropping 10lbs each time.  Not much but since I pull in some way 5 days out of the week (barbell rows, dumbbell rows, chest supported rows, weighted chin ups, and pull ups) I get plenty of bicep work at full and partial ROMs."
powerlifting,36ncl1,bigcoachD,1 point,Thu May 21 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I should have mentioned than in what I posted within this same thread.  My beltless squat went up by a lot.  On top of that, last week my head wasn't in the game for one of my sets and I accidentally made a 40lb pause squat PR (accidentally paused at the bottom)."
powerlifting,36ncl1,bigcoachD,1 point,Thu May 21 13:28:23 2015 UTC,"I use this type of training. I love it right now. Will I still love it in a year? No idea, but i am enjoying it for the moment. Im gaining weight and my lifts are going up. My ass and thighs especially have grown"
powerlifting,36lwuz,exatorp,3,Wed May 20 10:26:28 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting training method. I like the idea of doing regular testing, rather than testing at the end of every training block.   RPE is a funny measure though, eh? Some days I'll pull a deadlift that kicks my ass, a week later I'll pull the same weight without blinking. Was one a 9 and the other a 6, even though they're the same weight? Or am I not getting what RPE measures?"
powerlifting,36lwuz,Truck_Rockpec,7,Wed May 20 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"Na you got it. Rpe is how the weight feels for that day, regardless of how it felt another day."
powerlifting,36lwuz,abductedabdul,7,Wed May 20 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Rpe is how the weight feels for that day, regardless of how it felt another day.   RPE isn't about how it feels, but rather about how many reps you could have done. It's a subtle, but important, difference."
powerlifting,36lwuz,delph,3,Wed May 20 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Yea, you're right. That is actually a very important part of autoregulation training"
powerlifting,36lwuz,abductedabdul,3,Wed May 20 18:15:09 2015 UTC,Just trying to add to the discussion. :)
powerlifting,36lwuz,delph,3,Wed May 20 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why RPEs work. When that deadlift feels like a true 9 RPE, auto-regulate and call it (unless you have back off work to do). When that deadlift feels like a 6 RPE, keep pushing for a new PR at a 9 RPE."
powerlifting,36lwuz,nygmattyp,4,Wed May 20 17:10:48 2015 UTC,I mentioned AMRAPs to RPE here and people didn't seem to get it. Glad to see Bryce understands me.
powerlifting,36lwuz,Teekam,2,Wed May 20 14:14:47 2015 UTC,Glad to call him ma coach. He's had me implement 3 AMRAPs over the past....hm... 10 or so weeks? It has definitely been great.
