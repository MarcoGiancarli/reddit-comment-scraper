RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,tmv23,9,Tue Jul 21 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"""No player should be made to feel singled out, harassed or discriminated against in game""  Guess im a 10 year old who cant mute people :/, thanks for protecting me riot and if he was being this toxic why did riot not notice it sooner? why did someone have to send in a screenshot. Isn't that kinda the point of the whole system they have in place?"
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,aealow,2,Tue Jul 21 22:16:39 2015 UTC,Because he was good.  If riot banned him when he and his team were doing well there would be chaos.
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,reskk,6,Wed Jul 22 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"fuck. this. shit.  Riot acts as judge, jury and executioner again, I'm so fed up with this. ""Competitive integrity"" ... what a joke"
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,wtfbbqfagg,3,Tue Jul 21 21:29:49 2015 UTC,But nothing will be done about it because the player base consists of 12 year old soft care-bear idiots. It sucks that these people aren't mature enough to use the mute button; and what really gets under my skin is how these man-child behaving players feel so entitled to get other players punished over the internet on a video game.   This bullshit riot anti-toxicity circlejerk has gone too far. Its understandable if the players are punished for breaking actual rules and laws. Its almost as if riot wants to take us back to kindergarten and parent manners into its player base for playing this fairytale piece of shit game.   Fixing client? Nope.  Adding more bans? Nope.  Dealing with AFKs and Trolls? Nope.   Lets instead punish people for saying bad words on the internet
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Spuzman,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"Putting aside the (in my opinion, valid) criticisms of inconsistency in their competitive rulings, Riot has long made it clear that they want to make an effort to reduce the toxicity of their playerbase-- likely for both moral and business reasons.  Additionally, the idea that Riot's anti-toxicity efforts are directly influencing their output in other areas seems like a fallacy. While Riot employees have recently admitted that the company is not spending their resources efficiently, that doesn't mean that dropping every player behavior team member would've magically made the client/balance team work better.   And frankly, I applaud Riot for their efforts (execution aside) to reduce the hate-spewing behavior that tends to dominate anonymous interactive media like LoL. If you're really of the opinion that player behavior doesn't veer into unacceptably harmful speech, either your head is in the sand or you're the one who's as mature as a 12 year old."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,PershingSt,4,Tue Jul 21 22:13:13 2015 UTC,The client runs on Adobe fucking air ! Think about that for 10 seconds before you make excuses for them ...

RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,aealow,3,Tue Jul 21 22:18:04 2015 UTC,"They understand the problems but their solutions are so bad, also harassment and abuse happens but there are many very very simple ways to handle that kinda thing, whats wrong with taking personality responsibility to protect yourself? Asking people to mute toxic players is not asking too much! And their system does nothing to help and rehabilitate toxic players, sending players to normals and forcing them to win games does not work!"
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,buu11235,2,Tue Jul 21 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"Or you know, you could have personal responsibility and not say anything."

""This frustrated competitive gamer who obviously likes to win used bad words at his teammates who were acting like dickheads; lets restrict his chat privileges so that he can no longer communicate with his team and coordinate moves in their heavily teamwork oriented game.""    In which world will this help the frustrated gamer and help him not use bad words anymore"
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,aealow,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"The funny part is that the ban and the amount of games you have to win just keeps going up, in what world is this a solution? Riot acts like players being upset or frustrated is unnatural, like they cant possibly understand why someone would be toxic. They do not wanna be real about the problem and that's why they cant find real solutions."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,PasteeyFan420LoL,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:58 2015 UTC,Riot changed the definition of toxic from being something poisonous or harmful to being a real human being with emotions and a competitive drive.
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,wtfbbqfagg,3,Tue Jul 21 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"See? you're a living example of the conformation process. I can only expect this kind of reply from the typical pimply neck-beard basement dweller.    If you've ever played any competitive sport you'll find that criticism is the fuel that creates an average player into a good or even great player. You will be called out if you fuck up, and if you choose to be a dickhead in a team sport you will be kicked straight away. LoL players seem to forget these basic dynamics of a team sport. To riot a bad word is a bad word, it doesn't account for the frustration of a competitive person who cares about winning.   If you're saying heil hitler and dropping the N word around, this should obviously deserve punishment. But when it relates to the game which prides upon being so competitive; people shouldn't be banned for criticism or game related shit talk. Like come on, are people really this immature to take offense from ""gg ez""?   After all it is a video game. Theres a fine-line to everything. There is a functioning mute button, why must they go beyond their way to conform the environment into a pre-school class. There is a functioning world out there that works just as fine without a overruling authority punishing people for using bad words and hurting each other's feelings. Grow up, ITS A FUCKING VIDEO GAME."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,2defixx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"Its not even that fact that they punish valid criticism. They do not punish people in any way for being bad on purpose in an actual game. Its not against the rules and it certainly is never punished if someone queues for ranked and then goes ""I only play for fun and today I decided full AP jungle Twitch is fun. Also I am so drunk I can hardly hit my keys"". How is that not bad for the game and the other 9 people involved in it? I have played online games for a pretty long time and in any game where a group of people want to achieve something and its crunch time people like these get kicked, no questions ask. If Riot wants to improve their game why do they only focus on swear words, the most childish and irrelevant issue there is. I can mute you with a single click on a button. I can't stop someone who has no interested in being competitive from joining a competitive game mode. And even if they clearly state they actually don't give a shit whether they lose or win thats apparently fine. I don't get it... honestly."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,PasteeyFan420LoL,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:34 2015 UTC,"lets get this straight: the problem is not that Riot enforces its rules, the problem is that they are incosistent as f*** and you have no way to protest against a riot ruling. Just remember poor incarnation how had to lick Riots boots for more than a year with the vague expectation to get unbanned. maybe. With the amount of money thats on the line thats pretty absurd. Because if you are banned by Riot, there is no other circuit or high profile independent tournaments you could fall back to. Its LCS or bust.  Now if you think Forg1ven and the few others that were punished are the only ones who are ""toxic"" in SoloQueue, then think again. Its like those laws against internet-piracy. Not everyone who does it will be punished. But it can always be used against you, if you behave inconvenient. Forg1ven always spoke real talk, not the boring standard PR bullshit almost everyone else is speaking."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,2defixx,5,Tue Jul 21 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen so many instances of the TSM players raging and being ""toxic"" in solo q and we have multiple instances of Regi bullying his teammates and players sometimes to point of tears and physical rage, but they remain untouched because they are Riot's esports golden goose. If Forg1ven is toxic for being passionate about the game then why isn't Regi? Every time I see him do anything like that he gets praised as being so passionate about his team and LoL when all I really see is a bully. And don't try to pull the whole Riot didn't have rules against it crap because we've seen them punish people using rules that didn't exist at the time of the incident."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Faterou,0,Tue Jul 21 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"Alright I got to ask this. Do people like you actually believe what Riot does is working in any measurable sense? Do you play this game? How is it then possible that you could think that? Their methods suck and they literally never release results, not counting Lyte pulling numbers like ""126% toxicity"" out of his ass on Twitter. You know why that is? Because there are no results for them to show you. I have played this game since beta and nothing has changed. Not even compared to CSGO or Dota - every game is the same. Its apparently how human kind works and what Riot wants to do is change human behavior on a global scale in a video game. Only they don't say it that way because if they would even people like you would probably go ""Wait, what?""  Riot does nothing with your money, they sell you false and made up stats and as far as simply making games goes there is nothing either. Applaud whatever utopic or delusional stance on video game development you like but at least be realistic about it. I wonder what people would say if Facebook suddenly banned people from their service for being mean, ridicules. They create a medium they aren't fucking Superman incarnate."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,wtfbbqfagg,0,Wed Jul 22 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"Things people say in game is straight up violence and no company want their product to be used in that way. Also, expecting people to just mute is like telling a teen that gets bullied at school to just put headphones and ignore them."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Faterou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"How fucking stupid do you have to be to compare those 2 things. bullying in real life can lead to physical violence, which is serious.

RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,wtfbbqfagg,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:59 2015 UTC,Psychological violence is as harmful as physical violence and it's not because it can lead to physical violence.  EDIT: I also don't understand how the channel in which the message is conveyed influences the consequences.
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Faterou,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"So if someone says I suck at a videogame I'm supposed to feel really bad; almost as if I'd want to kill myself? You seriously cannot possibly be this retarded to think getting shittalked over a video game can amount to the same affect as to getting physically violated by bullies.   Like come on, 10 year olds on call of duty can handle themselves better mentally than the neckbeards that play this game."

I'm not ""stupid"" enough, like you said, to think somebody would kill himself or get depressed because somebody told them they sucked."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Faterou,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Thats pretty much the basis for majority of the reports. Since the tribunal is broken, it all comes down to the quantity of times you're reported.

RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,wtfbbqfagg,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"If you tell people they suck in 70% of your games, you deserve that chat restriction/ban. You don't deserve to be in a community if the majority of your time you curse at people for being bad."

RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Faterou,0,Wed Jul 22 00:34:38 2015 UTC,The comparison is ridiculous. Here is the appropriate comparison- telling someone to use the mute feature in a video game is like telling a bullied teen to ask his jacked up bodyguard for protection when the bullying takes place. I have a feeling a bullied teen would have no problem using any tools available to protect himself.
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,kewlcumber,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"The tool is different. The abuse will stop because of the fear of the bodyguard. In case of a mute button (or headphones in my analogy), the abuse doesn't stop, he just doesn't hear it."

Even if just 50% of those are legitimate that's a massive behavioral pattern that needs to be addressed. He's on the world stage (ish) and sets an example for people aspiring to reach that level.  He should be held to a standard.
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,Sempha,2,Tue Jul 21 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, he shouldn't be held to a standard.  I'd much rather have a really good player criticizing their team & ultimately carrying the game instead of a dickhead mediocre entitled player who refuses to communicate with the team and spams ""report x"" to whomever said a bad word to him.   Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, CR7, M Ali, they wouldn't have reached the peak if they weren't competitive and freakishly cared more about winning than their competitors."

And at his rank (I'd assume masters/challenger) then he isn't going to solo carry.   If he's using discriminatory abuse then that's more than 'delete lol you're shit' or the like. That line is pretty much all we have to reveal what language he was using, and it's pretty clear it wasn't the normal pissed off at your team mates level stuff. It was consistent repetitive targeted abuse.  But I forgot what sub I was in for a moment, obviously you're going to assume the worst of Riot here, silly me."
RiotFreeLoL,3e4d69,JoshuaKevinPerry,2,Tue Jul 21 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"Just like you said, he plays at a high level.   At that level he gets to play with the same players over and over again, so its possible that he gets reported by the same players over and over again, and maybe just maybe the report stats are highly inflated?

Something everyone who plays this game agrees to.    RIOT GAMES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU.   That right there is enough to shut everyone's argument down.   They also posted another part of the LCS rules that he SIGNED AND AGREED, to uphold. As such Riot could have completely removed him from the scene for good. Rule I am talking about is:   10.1.2 Profanity and Hate Speech. A Team Member may not use language that is obscene, foul, vulgar, insulting, threatening, abusive, libelous, slanderous, defamatory or otherwise offensive or objectionable; or promote or incite hatred or discriminatory conduct, in or near the match area, at any time. A Team Member may not use any facilities, services or equipment provided or made available by LCS or its contractors to post, transmit, disseminate or otherwise make available any such prohibited communications. A Team Member may not use this type of language on social media or during any public facing events such as streaming    To those who say ""it's just the internet"" well let me give you this advice. The internet is still real. And there is another person at the end of it. You have no idea what that person is like. Saying something like ""oh my god you should just quit right now, you suck so bad."" could just make them laugh, or it could just add to them feeling worse about themselves.   When it comes to depression, it doesn't take much to make that person feel like they are un-wanted or like they don't belong there. So it's not always about ""Oh just mute them."" Muting them doesn't solve the colossal shit hole that has become of the League community.   I say this. If you were to speak to your mother like you do to the people in League of Legends what would she say? I for one (being toxic sometimes) would be slapped and dis-owned on the spot. And don't give me that ""I am never toxic"" Bullshit, because everyone rages at one point or another.   Always think that the enemy/team mate you are about to just throw all the hate you have at is someone you care and love for. Just because you know you could never tell those people those things.   EDIT: forgot to add this: He is a Pro level player. He is and should be put under extremely harsh standards. He is part of a giant face of League of Legends. And those who make it up, should be acting like adults not, entitled little shits who go off when they are losing a pub game."

I am pro banning people for toxicity, by the tribunal, and it should result in a few hours ban or ranked restriction. I dont agree with people having their accounts locked for good. One of my friends had received the free skin at the end of last season for being a model player, this month, in 2 weeks game time he got his account banned for good. Without having any prior bans. He invested real money in the skins he had on that account, worth aprox 1500 euros, so I dont think its normal to lock accounts for toxicity.  In the case of Forgiven I'm not sure what to say, 4 games is too much, I didnt agree with the ban for Sven at worlds either but I'm biased here since I dont like Incarnation and I agreed with his ban."

I know my friend wanted a smurf with their own name and got bored of leveling it themselves after level 10, so botted it up with a popular volibear themed bot. they bought EXP boots (including the starter pack of champions) and have wasted $100 or so on that account to get some skins/champs"

I've jacked a few botted accounts once they hit 30 from these botting companies to keep as spares/smurfs. they usually have 30-50k IP on them and never get banned since the botters aren't usually going to report the account to riot :)"

Almost 2 hours of disecting and qulifying the relations that SHOULD exist in a team, among players - coach staff - management. Constructed over Regi's posts, this is a fuckin manual of how to make a team work from hierarchy and psychological points of view.  Sadly, I dont think there's no one inside TSM with enough inteligence and humility to try incorporate any aspect of whats been presented here; As far a we've seen from TSM, Im afraid their respone (or their thoughts while watching this) would be arguments concentred on defending what they've been doing (or not doing), instead of trying to recognice their own mistakes."
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Micolino,2,Sun Jul 19 15:13:09 2015 UTC,Thorin's a pretty vocal critic of TSM (I mean just look at the shit last year - Thorin was witchhunted like crazy by angry TSM fans and booted out of his job at OnGamers) so I'd be surprised if anyone on TSM even watches it.   Let alone absorbs the information and considers what he's saying holds some actual merit/truth/weight.  The fact that Loco can't even get authoritative power is pretty problematic.  You can tell that Bjergsen often questions and challenges him and when he doesn't see eye-to-eye he acts like a spoiled kid who doesn't listen to his parents.  And Reginald for some reason encourages that stuff and wants the other players to do that too.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Sorenthaz,6,Tue Jul 21 09:13:30 2015 UTC,"Regi need to give Loco authority that the players cant go over his final call.  Thats how a coach works.

Regi and Loco even agree on a lot of things in the tsm video, but bjerg is wanting to do other things and Loco isnt any authority to make the final decision."
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,gahyoujerk,3,Sat Jul 18 23:56:00 2015 UTC,So far it's the same. TSM just lost a game vs TIP.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,siamond,4,Sat Jul 18 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Well, Bjerg took the blame for not playing the comb right in a tweet. However the rest of the world is going to look at it as far as tsm goes the draft was fine and suddenly its the teams fault not Reginalds. That's exactly what Thorin predicted in this video. Came true around 3 hours later."
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,2defixx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yep... it's all a blame game.   Yeah the players should be at fault in certain areas, but they're basically taking blame away from Reginald's coaching methods at the same time."
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Sorenthaz,2,Tue Jul 21 09:16:12 2015 UTC,"Thorin did make a prediction for TSM of still being able to go 3-1 for their last 4 games, since 3 of the teams are 6-8th place (it was the very end of the video)"
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Draddock,2,Sun Jul 19 06:57:47 2015 UTC,It's hilarious that the first comp they play with Regi in charge is a throwback to Season 2 TSM with double globals.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,UranusIsBestAnus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:41 2015 UTC,The coaching isn't as big of an issue right now tbh.  In the match vs Liquid they just straight-out played poorly.  The same goes for today vs TIP.   TSM's players are just shitting the bed and no amount of coaching is going to help that.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Sorenthaz,4,Sun Jul 19 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, poor play has absolutely nothing to do with poor choaching..."
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,freeezzzeee,2,Sun Jul 19 11:00:39 2015 UTC,I mean yeah poor coaching can be an element but there are probably bigger issues going on with the players right now.  It's not strictly one thing or another usually.  And with playing it could also be some problems with player mentalities/emotions and whatnot.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Sorenthaz,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:13:41 2015 UTC,Ive never played in the lcs or been on a lcs team so i glad that i have people like you who have actual experience and can give us some insight into whats going.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,aealow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:11 2015 UTC,This is absolute quality. I believe TSM will continue having issues until Loco is fired and Regi instally a new yes-man as a coach. But it won't work long-term.
RiotFreeLoL,3drizi,Komparativist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:19:37 2015 UTC,Or they just need to get certain player egos in check and Loco needs to actually have the power to make decisions.  Which Reginald won't let him have right now.

RiotFreeLoL,3drdcf,EtoshOE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed that it's disappointing; however, one thing the article doesn't address is that the Bo3 format in LCK and LPL is better for making match-to-match adjustments.  In LCS it's Bo1 all the way to the end of the regular season.  If you only have one game at a time, you basically always assume that you want your highest value player on the field every game for every best of 1.  If you have a best of three or five series, you might see one particular player show weakness in an opening game or lack preparation for a match-up, you strategically sub them in game 2 and see if your adjustment works, if not you either lost 0-2 with an attempt to flip the strategy, or you pushed it to a game 3 and you can see if your strategy wins again or make additional changes.  Without the motivation of the series win, there's very little incentive to gamble with roster swaps for best of 1 without very serious team problems presenting themselves."

The fact that he was a professional player at some point does not mean he still has the knowledge to make competitive decisions at the end of 2015. I still know how to build Bankplank or cA$he does that make me a good player today?  If he just wants to facilitate productive talks among the team I still feel a sports psychologist would fill that role better. Or any kind of person with an education in that direction whether its geared towards sports or group therapy. Reginald is not exactly know as the most level headed, emphatic, faciliteter of productive discussions.

That's something you'd do in the off season when there's plenty of time for that person to study each of the players on the team and come up with a long term strategy for the split or season. Honestly, Regi is the best person to fill that role at the moment, considering how close to the end of the summer split we are. Plus, all the players on the team have a lot of respect for Regi. He may not be able to come up with world class strats on his own, but he has the best chance out of anyone else to get back to where they need to be."

RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Alamzul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:49:15 2015 UTC,well then we both have different understanding from world class.  as to me world clas doesnt have grades its the groupe of S+ players who are keyplayers who have almost every game the most positive influence on the games even on international stage vs the best teams  Clearlove`s influence on games is strongly depending on the WORLDCLASS players he has around him which to me shows that hes just a roleplayer whos good not more
RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Parasit1989,5,Mon Jul 20 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Also how the hell he's concidered top 5? He's got huni, feb, rekkless, and YS with 1 good showing internationally.   Well, ClearLove just needed best AD in the world, as well as arguably best midlane in the world, to get any international performance in two years."
RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,DidYuhim,0,Sat Jul 18 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"arguably best midlane   U w00t m8  ClearLove is still vastly superior to Reignover. I don't agree with... certain analysts... that he is somehow on the level of Kakao, Spirit etc., but he is undoubtedly really good.   I agree that the form of argument is spurious, though. That's not even analysis. It's just saying ""he has good players on his team so he can't be good himself."" Which could then be logically extended to every other member of the team until, suddenly, none of them are good...  It's still true that Reignover is not world class. When you get schooled by Bengi and frequently underperform in EU LCS, you're really not world class."
RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Alamzul,3,Mon Jul 20 11:47:51 2015 UTC,"Well question is, why did you even had a need to write this. Anyway yes i would say he is kinda world class, if he is able to play against best and still be the better one. Anyway i believe nobody in this fucking world believes Clearlove sucks.

RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Hondlis,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"While I'm not as down on Reignover as you are, his ""good showing"" was 2-3 in groups and then losing a B05."

P.S.: I don't actually thing Bengi is that bad, but he's certainly not as good as he was in s3."
RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Alamzul,2,Mon Jul 20 11:57:16 2015 UTC,Why hate people when you can love the ones that like clearlove? and where did u take that casual western people think that  alot of them are fans of reignover because he plays in our region they maybe dont care about china that does not mean that they think he sucks
RiotFreeLoL,3dqbm6,Niash,2,Sat Jul 18 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Well you have to remember ""casual westerners"" don't watch LPL (myself included) so i / we know fuck all about the LPL. On balence i probably wouldn't put Reignover above Clearlove personally - but since i've hardly seen him play its hard to judge. We are in a rut of good junglers right now IMO (ffs Bengi is still top-tier) so i don't think 4th or 5th is that far-fetched.   Also i don't consider Reignovers performance from two years ago to be relevant now - nobody's performance 2 years ago is. in 2013 Clearlove was on the WE team that barely finished top 3 in the summer season - not exactly steller either is it?  Also you make it sound as if having Huni and Feb etc is a bonus, as if you admitting that the rest of the Fnc players are world class... yet somehow Reignover isn't? seems inconsistent."

Also you make it sound as if having Huni and Feb etc is a bonus, as if you admitting that the rest of the Fnc players are world class... yet somehow Reignover isn't? seems inconsistent.   There's nothing ""inconsistent"" about different players on the same team having different skill levels. That's called human variation. Reignover, unless he's been holding back a multitude of picks, is easily the weakest player on that team.  The argument itself is spurious, though. If anything, having more star players on the team makes it harder to shine, not easier.  Spirit is currently rocking LPL and looking better than virtually every other jungler on the BOTTOM TEAM. He's easily one of the best junglers in the world, but would he look as monstrous if he wasn't allowed to be the main carry literally every game? Doubtful.   He might still be the best, but he wouldn't look quite as dominant because he wouldn't be getting as much room to carry."

Many days at Riot, Lyte probably never even interacts with the dev department or knows what is going on besides basics.  These people act like Riot is a company of 10 people where everyone is close and eats lunch together rather than one of 100+ people divided into departments.  Lyte probably works woth people in his team most days, eats lunch on break woth some of them and never interacts with people from other departments.  Thats how things work in a big company.  Lyte doesnt know much more about development of new features or why game replay hasnt been implemented than the average player.  Sure he could ask someone he has acquantance with about those things, but then hed have to stop his job to do that.  People should just ask Lyte stupid questions about tribunal and toxicity since that is the thing he actually does for his job."

I don't play 10+ games a day like I used to, I probably pay 2-3 matches a day and I rarely encounter actual trolls. Either your over-sensitive to trolling (maybe your idea of trolling involves a larger range of actions) or perhaps you are too focused on what the troll is doing and less focused on what you're doing. Ever hear the term ""don't feed the troll""? Stop telling it what to do, stop trying to reason with it, just play your game in silence. Eventually they'll stop.   Also, probably 80% of people who say they will troll to lose the game on purpose are too pussy to actually do it. It's just them being a little bitch.

RiotFreeLoL,3ddjig,gaignun23,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Uh, ok. First off, I didn't call Dom bad, but if you want to make an argument that he's better than Meteos before C9 fell off a cliff, or Move now or Rush at the start of this season, then there really is nothing to say. That's just ridiculous. Not best NA = not worth mentioning internationally. NA has always been radically outclassed in the jungle, even by Europeans.  I don't believe you have to be Korean (or Chinese, wtf lol - most individually talented region in the world, the anomaly that is Faker aside) to be world class.   Examples: xPeke and Febiven are/were world class mids. Peke went toe to toe with S4 Dade and looked good, even totally dominant one game. Febiven put up the best performance of any westerner ever vs. Faker (and significantly better than many Koreans can claim, too).   Huni is a world class top laner. He can put up a fight against the best. His demolishment of Marin 2 or 3 games in their bo5 proves as much, although it would have looked a bit shakier vs a top tier Korean top laner. Fredy122 was world class last season. Went toe to toe with anyone and looked absolutely monstrous on tanks. Was he as good as Acorn or the like? No. Was he world class? Definitely.   It's difficult to measure western ADCs. Forg1ven has never gotten a good chance to compete internationally. Rekkles has improved a lot, but was completely exposed previous worlds. Sneaky is rock solid, could probably make an argument he's world class - at least he isn't a huge liability. Tabzz had many moments of brilliance summer 2014, but hasn't seen much play or looked very good since.  Supports? Lustboy is a veteran Korean, although definitely world class. STILL A KOREAN, THOUGH - DOESN'T LEGITIMATELY COUNT. Yellowstar is amazing. Not the best laning phase of all time, but all around great player. Proved just how great he still is at MSI. Better than s4 Mata or peak form Gorilla? Uh, no, not likely. Still an absolute monster and world class? Absolutely. Not even factoring his shotcalling here which is, again, world class. But unlike with, say, Hai, you can make the argument for Yellowstar even if he weren't a shotcaller.  And so on. I'm sure I forgot someone.  Jungle is by far the weakest western position. Has been ever since Diamondprox lost his form.  It's a stretch to even include Huni or Reignover in the west, btw, although with Huni since he made his debut professionally in the west I think it's fair. Even if you include him, Reignover already showed how ""world class"" he is versus the best junglers in the world. Even Bengi made him look like an idiot."
RiotFreeLoL,3ddjig,Alamzul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:54:00 2015 UTC,It is indeed sad that west hasnt been able to produce a jungler even remotely close to what diamondprox was at his prime in S2 :(

That being said I am still trying to let my opinion on the matter be noticeable while staying a bit objective. TL;DR is at the bottom.  That was due to him attempting to ""poach"" a player in an LCS squad not challenger squads. He was punished for ""poaching"" LCS players for his challenger series team.   Edited detail added in: In Badawi's example of ""poaching"" from an LCS team it is rumored that he was not even trying to get in the way of the player's current contract, but wanted them once their contract was done.  As far as having rules set for it goes they were originally just for other LCS organizations, and did not mention the challenger series. RIOT, or their E-Sports section whatever, then chose to create a new stipulation to their rule book, and gave Badawi the most strict punishment for ""poaching"" yet. The issue with that is/was there was no rule that included him in their original public rule book. They had also set a precedent of punishing poaching by fines, and ineligibility for the poached player to play on their stage for X amount of time. With Badawi they chose to create a completely new style of punishment and took it to an unprecedented level of banning him from various forms of involvement with RIOT's E-sports, which included ability to be an owner of an LCS team. I would like to note that Reginald, from TSM, was not reprimanded to this degree for ""poaching"" Bjergsen he was given a fine, and Hotshot had the same punishment style of a fine applied to him for poaching TWO people, Scarra and ZionSpartan, from Dignitas. These are the two events of poaching I can remember currently partially due to the powerhouse popularity their respective organizations bring to LoL E-sports with their teams.  TL;DR: They did not punish Badawi for anything done within the challenger series. They punished him for ""poaching"" from a contracted LCS player. There were no rules at the time in their public rule book that noted a challenger team could be reprimanded for ""poaching"" from LCS only LCS from LCS. They then gave him an unprecedented degree of punishment from all other poaching cases since LCS was created.  Edit: added a detail on Badawi's ""poach"""
RiotFreeLoL,3d9wxl,CorySyco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a general confusion between the terms used. Poaching is when you successfully hire a player from another team under contract without going through the ""proper"" channels according to Riot.   Tampering is when you ATTEMPT to do this. I can't remember the exact wording but Badawi was punished for attempting to poach(i.e. tampering) as none of his talks actually amounted to someone breaking their contract and moving to RNG."
RiotFreeLoL,3d9wxl,poookie13,0,Wed Jul 15 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"Hence why I used poaching in quotes most of the time in my comment when it had to do with Badawi, but hey I appreciate the attempt at clarifying/correcting me without having the proper term to use yourself. More power to you I suppose."

RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,maurosQQ,13,Mon Jul 13 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to a few things...   CS has been around longer and there is greater stability in the community/game - new things will generally be less stable the LoL tournament/league system promotes a very big high and low-lows mentality. Players are more likely to leave a team or team disband after getting, say, demoted from LCS or missing out on promotion - there are some more distinct milestones, whereas in CS at the moment, there are tournaments (and lots of them) which you can go to as a team but also not winning a tournament isn't so bad necessarily, but say if not getting out of group stages of a tournament meant you couldn't come to the next one, you'd probably find more teams disbanding, etc.   Then as you say, there is more frequent change in LoL and metas. The whole season/patch change thing promotes this as well. You hit a finite stage of the year when people will drop out, find other things interesting, etc."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,marrakoosh,2,Mon Jul 13 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly the meta shifting is probably one of the bigger issues with professional play in LoL.  The meta honestly can hurt a lot of professional players by forcing them to suddenly change their playstyle up.  And people who become known for playing certain styles or champs will become much weaker when those champs and styles are nerfed or other champs/styles become significantly better. That and the fact that Riot controls all official tournaments to where the only way to become a pro LoL gamer is to go through Riot's hoops in order to start making money off professional gaming.  That and unless you're in the upper tier of pro players, streaming is way more profitable if you can get to a decent viewer/subscriber count.  And it requires less effort and risk involved.  In comparison, DotA 2 afaik doesn't make as many drastic changes in a year that LoL does.  Yes the ""meta"" (if DotA 2 even has a concrete meta) changes and shifts around, but it doesn't do so as randomly as Riot likes to do with LoL.  And DotA 2 has SEVERAL professional venues beyond the big stuff because Valve doesn't feel the need to control their esports scene outside of The International.  So even pros in the amateur scene can make a decent amount of money."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,Sorenthaz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"Icefrog doesn't enforce a meta onto the Dota playerbase. He buffs and nerfs things how he sees fit, but there is not Valve-mandated meta. After each patch, the pro scene experiments with different heroes and strategies and figures out what works best. There are always heroes and strategies that are better than others, but rarely is it such a huge difference that you must play that way. TI4 with its deathball pushes and tanky pushing mid heroes is as close as Dota has ever been to a strict ""meta"", and Dota players pretty much universally agree that that patch was boring to watch.  The Dota metagame is extremely fluid, all top tier players have to know how to play all different kinds of heroes and strategies, or they fall off like LoL pros. Just look at Alliance and specifically AdmiralBulldog."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,g0kartmozart,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the deathball meta was really disappointing to watch during the TI4.  During the grand finals it was pretty much a stomp with games decided by 15-25 minutes.  LoL's Worlds haven't even been that stompy.  I should probably start paying more attention to what's going on in DotA 2 since I did buy the level 50 Compendium pack for $28 or w/e.  And yeah I know how crazy DotA 2 is - the pros at it are pretty damn impressive.
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,Sorenthaz,8,Wed Jul 15 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of progaming is based around knowledge and reaction times. Soccer and basketball, waning talent can get by on experience. Those games have been pretty much explored fully and solved. League, on the other hand, hasn't. Think about it, how useful is the League experience of 3 years ago compared to a traditional sport? Going back and watching Season 2 Regional Qualifiers will look absolutely dreadful. Remembering how to play in a meta where a tanky jungler got ahead and then bought Oracles and swept the entire map doesn't mean dick anymore.  Then you take into account that newer, younger, players are coming into the scene. I've got a ton of effectively useless pokemon information in my head, but they don't. They can more readily use that to remember matchups or even the fabled ability damage flash card stuff the Koreans do. The early wave of players didn't grow up with the game, the current wave did. Boxer and Yellow grew up in a SC meta where people were trying to figure out the game, how to play correctly. Flash and Jaedong walked into a game that was largely solved, they just had to use their talents to play the game exceptionally. I don't have much interaction with CS:GO, as I only watch TSM's matches, but CS has been around for a long time."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,gahlo,5,Mon Jul 13 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"I attribute a lot of it to the fact that e-sports games are constantly changing. This isn't like football, baseball, soccer, basketball, etc. where the rules of the game have largely remained constant for a verrrry long time. Some small things change between seasons, but not a whole lot.  In LoL as an example, things can change drastically in a few weeks time. Have a player who is ridiculously good on a given champion? Tough luck, that champion has now been nerfed into oblivion. All the hours spent practicing it at a high level are now basically useless and there is no guarantee they will return to form on a different champ. Sometimes it isn't even champion specific, the fundamentals of summoner's rift have drastically changed every season.  E-sports titles are also all fairly new. Think of the pros of old. When did they start playing LoL? Around 20 or so? You have players now who started playing when they were 13. In this situation its just that the new players are better than the old players ever were, not that the old players suddenly got worse.   Finally, I think there is a practical situation. E-sports is hard work for players. They practice a ridiculous amount every day for mediocre rewards. There are obviously exceptions, but most of these players are underpaid for the amount of time they need to invest for competition. Eventually real life calls. You need to have a decent paying job to survive in the world, that is just reality. And in E-sports, even if you have a decent salary there is no guarantee it will be there a season later. Look at C9, it can happen that fast.  In truth its a mix of a lot of reasons. In general the scene is just too young to sustain a long termed career. Maybe in the future, but not yet.  Oh, and slightly unrelated, but for Korean players - they have mandatory military service so their careers are by default going to be shorter."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,RagnarDraconus,-5,Mon Jul 13 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"but the players that are 20, and the players that are 13, assuming both played the entire time, would have played the same amount. xD younger =/= better."

Dedicating time and learning something is the same post elementary level education until someone hits the drop-off which is argued everywhere between 30s to 50s. Maybe if it was a 6 year old learning, but at that point they wouldn't have the mechanical aptitude to pull off anything and would just spend time trying to learn key press timing.   Fighting games have large sweeping changes in patches very similar to LoL. If your theory was true 14-15 year olds would be dominate the scene, but instead it is usually age 20+."

RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,SakisRakis,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"It counters that response time and quick thinking is based on age, which it is not.   1 frame links in Street Fighter as well as the neutral game require much more precise timing than anything in a MOBA.

Ultimately if you look at lcs there's only 50 players in na and eu. of that 50 maybe a third are considered good enough to be top x at their positions and be guaranteed a job even if it means going to a worst team.   The rest of the players are expendable if they under perform at any time or even if they don't but someone else plays better they could potentially get replaced and considering you have a player pool of i'll estimate a couple thousands in masters+ not even mentioning importing players of other regions over, that could take their job some players after going into lcs and seeing that exposure just don't have the will to renter through the challenger grind.   So essentially what i'm trying to say is if you're not top x at your position and irreplaceable there's thousands of people out for your job. Unless you're continuously motivated which is hard to do when you're losing or kicked you'll eventually lose all motivation and skillwise have to retire."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,kavinh10,3,Tue Jul 14 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"Had just a quick moment to comment; so wanted to add aside from what you already mentioned that there seems a strong tendency towards burnout across all games.  Perhaps it's less pronounced within Counter-strike's elite.  Performing at a top level in any esport is an extremely mentally strenuous task; I tend to equate it to taking calculus exams for 10 or so hours a day. That'll take its toll after a time.  Combine that with the perception - correct or not - that a player's quickness in reaction times and hand/eye coordination peaks in the late teens or early twenties, and it's an easy conclusion to reach that perhaps it's time to embark on a ""real career"" before you end up with a resume that reads terribly by the time you're thirty."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,keekerdc,3,Mon Jul 13 15:28:10 2015 UTC,Fighting games alone can provide your counter-theory. Most top players in fighting games are 20+ and they require more hand-eye coordination.   I would say it has to do more with burnout than any physical limitation.
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,Solumindra,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'd argue fighting games are more like boxing where you just need one person and to keep that person in condition.

RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,Selcopa,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:08 2015 UTC,"Wait what? Do you have any idea what traditional pro sports are like.  Average Career is 10 years? Are you joking? Basketball: 4.8 years. Football: 3.3 years Hockey: 5.5 years Baseball: 5.6 years.  For Soccer the average length is 8 years if you account for their time in 2nd/3rd tier leagues, aka challenger.  There have been 300 players in the NHL who have over 1,000 games(~12 years).  I would not use the word common to describe long careers in traditional sports.  Are Esports careers shorter? Sure for many reasons, mainly, money isnt there. When you are 16-20 making $30-50k a year is perfectly fine for most, which is a bulk of the pro esports players earning, when you are approaching 30? its not so good."

Thus breaking their motivation for the game and starts to fall off. Like CS, it is very possible for 30 year old players to besiege the 17yo mechanical power houses. Look at csgo teams like NiP, Virtus Pro, and Na'vi... They are all pretty old dudes and still at the very top of the elite.  Then there might be some cases where the ""old dog euphemism"" kicks in and older players simply are stuck in their old ways. For example TheOddone who has a very good game sense but fails to work around the meta champions.  Then as the e-sports phenomenon is still young, players aren't sure how stable this profession is, and as they mature they wan't more safe options."

RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,jarredfetus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"There are physical limits to how long you can do physical sports in a day.  This sets an upper bound on how good people can be in the top flight.  In esports the upper limit is hours in the day that you can be supported by someone else while you play.  For professionals, pros like Piglet have people in multiple organizations he has been in say he practiced around ~18 hours a day.  CS is different because like others have said, the core gameplay strategy and tactics haven't changed in 15 years.  The only way you could compare the two is if CS was patched once per month to have 5-10 of the guns completely rebalanced with several major changes to all of the dominant pathing strategies on all the most popular maps."

With fame comes party and women. A lot of Pros get a taste of the party scene and women and they lose themselves in it because they haven't experienced it before. After a while they go partying too much, get too little sleep and they don't practice nearly enough. This got mentioned in the Fanatic video by their manager too.  Also a lot of pro's also seem to lose motivation after reaching high competitive level for a while. They just stay in for it for the money, rather than actually wanting to become the best. It also doesn't help that there is no chance of perfecting any kind of strategy, since Riot changes up the entire meta every 4 months."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4tmq,Mocktapus,2,Mon Jul 13 22:55:56 2015 UTC,"If this is true I'd probably have to accredit that to having barely any prestige because the only thing that holds that much prestige in League is Worlds (which is the only thing teams really strive for, for big teams in any scene getting 1st in a split in playoffs doesn't mean that much). If League had the CS style (or what I like to call the Tennis esque circuit) there are tournaments that hold lot more ground and meaning behind them (such as the three majors, big lans like ESEA, FACEIT) because the top teams meet and you get those storied headlines out of them, and in my opinion more entertainment value. Which is honestly why I watch CS more than League now because of this ever since OGN changed from their own format to LCK because two long splits don't really mean much to me. Thoorin made a video about the eSports formats as well I believe that goes more in depth."

RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,LuckMaker,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure C9 kikis would happen. Part of why he stepped down was shot calling issues, and C9 without Hai is the epitome of shot calling issues. Plus they have Meteos in the wings if they ever are disatisfied with Hai as a jungle."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,Eightlegged,4,Mon Jul 13 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Kikis wants to BE the shotcaller, in UoL, everyone was always talking and making calls and it was a scattered atmosphere, Kikis wants to BE the man - which is why C9 would work, since they have no shotcalling without Hai, and Hai can't play full time because of his wrists."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,Eightlegged,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"If that's the case then it could potentially happen. I didn't get the feeling from his post that he wanted to be the shotcaller, but I could very easily be wrong.  Either way, whether Hai stays, Meteos comes back, or they use Kikis, as long as they perform better than the first half of this split, I'm happy."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,Eightlegged,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"from his post that he was leaving ""I have always been a very competitive player and train 12-14 hours a day because I strive to be the best. I think I have grown a lot as a player and shotcaller""  he wants to be the shotcaller, and UoL existed without one, so for C9, it makes the most sense to go out and get someone that: A) fills the void of a full time jungler B) wants to be the shot caller.  C) has LCS experience and big game experience.  Hai can't play full time, and Meteos was an unwilling shot caller, clearly a fish out of water.  This move makes sense when you break it down, but we'll see what happens."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,HedgeOfGlory,2,Mon Jul 13 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"He could be the right fit then. It's big shoes to fill though, it was painfully obvious just how important Hais shotcalling was to the team when he left.   The issue with Meteos wasn't that he was an unwilling shotcaller, but that he was inexperienced and timid as a shotcaller. He had no experience being the teams primary shotcaller and didn't make confident calls, and it showed through their mid and late game play. Eventually the team atmosphere began to go downhill, just like their play did, and combined with the lack of results and the added stress of shotcalling, it took a toll on Meteos.  I personally am hoping that somehow Hai is able to handle playing full time again, and the old C9 lineup returns, but I realize that's unlikely. If Kikis comes in, I hope he can provide the same level of shotcalling Hai does."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,Eightlegged,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"First half? The split is nearly over, and they still look awful. Kikis would be worth a go, but since making Worlds/winning LCS is virtually impossible at this point, you've gotta assume they're going to make a clear plan before next split, and if it involves Kikis it won't be a ""let's give it a go"" kind of thing. They'll have plenty of time to scrim with different options and decide on something that they think can work.  Their problems are pretty deep though. C9 dominated in a much weaker region than NA is now or will ever be again. They don't just need a good jungler and good shotcalling - they also need Balls, Lemon and Incarnation to be a lot better than they've been"
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,RagnarDraconus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Since Meteos stepped down and Hai came back, they've looked better. Yes it hasn't gotten the results it should have, but they haven't looked as bad as they did. Worlds is definitely just a dream for them at this point. Even if the stars align and they make it, they won't do anything there.   They definitely have slowly lost steam since their first split as NA becomes stronger. The biggest issue is the shotcalling however. With Hai back in the roster they aren't playing as timidly as they were without him, and Sneaky has even said they were lost without Hai. The team needs someone like Hai to take control and direct them. Kikis might be the right fit, and you're definitely right that they have time to play around with it, but it's pretty big shoes you have to fill. It won't matter how much any of the players step up if they still don't know what to do outside of laning."
RiotFreeLoL,3d4spb,loganm98,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:41 2015 UTC,I don't see the point honestly. Hai's performance hasn't really been that bad. Unless they want to move Hai to support and try a new jungler. Desperate times call for desperate measures I suppose.

RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,Denworath,0,Fri Jul 17 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I don't understand you guys. Some skins are ""broken"" by virtue of being deceptive in terms of the attack area or range. So, we could say some things without being too subjective about skins. I don't think this is a bad question."
RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,pedophilanthropist,3,Tue Jul 14 07:35:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see how people can draw any kind of offensive conclusions from me asking this honestly. It is a simple question.   ""How was the cake?""  ""Do you like purple or red?""  ""Is the Gnar skin cool?""  The fuck it is an opinion question, is it a law now I can't take other consumer's thoughts into consideration when spending money?"

RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,ubern00by,-7,Tue Jul 14 14:05:34 2015 UTC,It's  a skin. It doesn't give you any in game advantages. What's the point of this thread??
RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,moba_kings,0,Tue Jul 14 00:37:21 2015 UTC,I think he wants to know if the ethsetics are worth the purchase
RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,ubern00by,-7,Tue Jul 14 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"That's the dumbest question ever, it's completely subjective. There's like 20 different channels uploading skin spotlights with all animations these days no point in spamming this sub with retarded threads."

RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,ubern00by,-4,Tue Jul 14 02:42:07 2015 UTC,What are you talking about OP literally asks other people's opinions on something subjective to reassure himself. That's pretty much the definition of hiveminding.
RiotFreeLoL,3d6z4g,UnicornGriffen4Real,2,Tue Jul 14 02:49:58 2015 UTC,Asking an opinion on  any subjective manner isn't hiveminding. OP isn't asking how many people have it or isn't asking a large collective audience to decide whether or not he should buy it.   He's asking on the opinions on it that shows  conscious  thought into a purchase. He's interested in the product and wants to buy it but asks for other opinions.  There isn't signs of social peer pressure to conform or need of association of masses. THIS isn't hive minding you dumb nut its post or pre-purchase behavior.

RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,How14DayBansWork,4,Mon Jul 13 02:26:52 2015 UTC,I think the system was stated to be like that. It isn't however going to be triggered by 1 game. My friend went off the rails in a few games and has never received an immediate ban.    Because I'm fairly convinced that some percentage of these people are not toxic whatsoever   You are already dealing with a completely different subset of the league community automatically by boosting. Normal players who don't rage will most likely see that they belong on their current elo or want to improve themselves. Ragers and those who aren't willing to admit that they belong in bronze/silver will buy eloboosts because they think they can hold their own in a higher elo. They likely rage in more games than those who accept the elo they are in. You probably do but the nail in a few coffins.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,Cyllid,4,Mon Jul 13 05:23:25 2015 UTC,"The guy honestly sounded a bit deluded about his own actions.  His standard of what is toxic is different from mine.  But I'd never say either of the two things that he gave as examples in a game.  And by his own admission, he does it every 5-10 games.  That's comments like those in EVERY game.  If everybody acted like he does.  Which is not the best atmosphere to have in a game.  I don't really care about comments like those directed at me.  But I can understand others not liking it."

RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,jazekerdehypotheker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"How can there be a different standard about toxicity? I would say there is no standard at all.   Its just a made up word with no clear definition of what constitutes it for the use in in-game related behaviour.Some say 'ggez' is toxic and others say 'go get cancer' is toxic. In the end i do  not believe any of them is toxic as they are just words and the person who is on the other end is giving it meaning to them and depending on their background it either affects them or not. There is no effective way to combat this behaviour because that would mean that we should reorganise society in a way that children never grow up in bad conditions. And then i even exclude the people with mental disorders who cant control their behaviour so they shouldnt be allowed to play the game at all.   Bad behaviour in game is a problem but like most things in life we try to combat the problem without understanding the cause of the problem. Bad behaviour in the environment we life in today will always exist. Just look in real life where some countries have death penalties yet people still commit murder, rape, maim and whatever else they do."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,mwar123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:29:17 2015 UTC,How can there be a different standard about toxicity? I would say there is no standard at all.   This is why they made the system define it through what was bannable when the tribunal was in place. What makes toxicity was  decided by the community.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,TBWolf,6,Wed Jul 15 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"This is public knowledge, riot has literally said this is how it works since the 14 day and permabans were introduced."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,TBWolf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:51:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've never heard a them specifically saying it involves the quantity of what you write, just the quality. What I'm saying is I suspect it involves large amounts of typing, because the dozen or so 14 week ban ""report cards"" i've seen (from random players, and my own experiences on lower elo accounts) involve a very large string of conversation."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,jazekerdehypotheker,8,Mon Jul 13 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"it doesn't involve saying a lot directly, but if you type more, you have a larger likelihood of tripping their word triggers."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,AtlasFumes,10,Mon Jul 13 04:38:45 2015 UTC,But surely mister PhD RiotLyte must have implemented algorithms and analyses of multiple games to come to a conclusion that you deserve a 14 day ban. We have waited for months/years for this system but the way you are describing it someone could have written it within a week.    Then again putting fear into a human being for acting like a human is the easiest way to change peoples behaviour. Just ask the government.  Hooray for Riot and wasting so much money on a PR guy with the PhD.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,jazekerdehypotheker,7,Mon Jul 13 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"Just curious, do you have any experience with code? Cause somehow even a basic system like op described has many technical hurdles that would make it take more than a week to develop. With how big and complex LoL is the auto-ban system is far more than a simple text parser."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,AtlasFumes,3,Mon Jul 13 15:39:47 2015 UTC,Technical hurdles? i wonder what these technical hurdles are as everything op described is based on the chatfunction in the game and that is already saved somewhere. As far as i know the system doesnt differentiate between context or words said so all it needs to do is look into its database of naughty words and numbers of times these words are used in the game and voila an automated ban system. The only thing that takes more then a week is collecting the naughty words and put a number on them for how heavy they count towards the 14-day bantreshhold.  I seriously doubt its going to be more complex then that and if it is then plz elaborate.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,ChefsSaltybawls,3,Mon Jul 13 17:22:14 2015 UTC,"So yes I agree with you on the simplicity of the basic chat log scanning. Recalling logs and parsing them for keywords is the initial first step.   I can't imagine it the system doesn't take anything into context though. If you use keywords in combination or multiple times through out a game it would probably see you as more ""toxic"" (using this word as a measurement of bannability not for the vague description of someone being an ass). One of my first programming assignment in C was a simple text parser/spell checker that looked for keywords/symbols. There is no way in hell only one person wrote the auto-ban system, and I highly doubt that the entire algorithm is a single if check against a list of keywords.   So beyond the complexities of a parser that are difficult to explain to someone who hasn't programmed one (especially one that is not just basic ascii) there are networking and database complexities.   There is no way the chat logs are reviewed in real time. Chat logs are most likely saved off with meta-info to a database for later review. Once these are run results must be aggregated, and acted upon. Account databases must be updated, the user must be notified, analytics databases and other systems must have their data updated as well. The point is for every tool or feature that a player sees there are a myriad of supporting backend features and systems that have to be created for or updated so that the new features will have all their functionality supported. Most if not all of these will be invisible to the player, and even if we told the player about these systems it wouldn't mean anything to them.  Another thing to take into account is developer time is much different that normal time. Developer often estimate a say a week for development time than it takes 2-3 times that long do to planning, prototyping, iteration, testing, bug fixing, and prepping for publication. As a dev I often forget to account for all this and more when estimating implementation time tables  Finally as far as op goes...  He is a self admitted elo booster. Unless he is doing fun stuff with vpns or multiple pc's (and maybe even if he is) Riot can tell that all these account belong to him, or at least his IP address (there are also other wyays to tell if two accounts are the same person besides that). To the system is probably appears as attempted ban evasion and multiple offenses.   Let me know if you want me get more specific. I'm writing his while taking a bathroom break at work and had to lean in favor of quick examples as opposed to an in depth analysis."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,jazekerdehypotheker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"It's definitely done in real time look into always on high availability database clusters. I do this shit all the time, real time data analysis isn't a new technology I'm not sure what type of backend structuring they have but they could literally have a program running against the server as the database is being populated. You could even have a stored procedure that sets of if a field reaches a certain ratio or a player gets reported a set number of times. If they didn't do it in real time they either have a shit backend team or loads of technical overhead so they are doing a total rewrite of the backend services(unlikely)."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,2defixx,0,Wed Jul 15 06:29:56 2015 UTC,"The problem is that we do not know how it works because apparently it needs to be so secretive instead of open so the community can actually point towards certain loopholes/faults that needs to be fixed which there will be plenty off in any system.   It could be as simple as i portrait it or as hard as combining ip addresses, reports, in-game clicking or lack there off,  use of skills, which items are bought and in what order, percentage of time you have those items, compare to the amount of gold you earned, connectivity loss or purposely lose connection etc. But i highly doubt making it so complex is worth it just for the purpose of  banning out or reigning in  so called toxicity via chat function.   Now i do seem to remember seeing a tweet from mister PhD Riotlyte that said something about that the first intentional feeder was banned using the system so it could be more complex then i originally thought but according to the op he was banned for using the wrong words as he self admits having an argument with other people from time to time.  He also states that the ban happens immediately after he went all bananas in one game so that suggests that chat is being reviewed in real time so its possible that the bansystem is built into the game itself and does not get reviewed in another database that needs to be updated after every game like you suggest. Im sure it will be sent to another database so its accessible for review by engineers, social behaviour analysts and whatnot  to see if the software works like it should and that there are no false positives and if there are the software hopefully will be adjusted.   The point is for every tool or feature that a player sees there are a myriad of supporting backend features and systems that have to be created for or updated so that the new features will have all their functionality supported. Most if not all of these will be invisible to the player, and even if we told the player about these systems it wouldn't mean anything to them.   Now to clarify as you might be offended by me saying something like this could be written in a week in my original post that was just a wild guess on that specific component but taking months/year(s) to write and implement the current system including all the backend features /systems is a joke. They said they were working on something when they shut the tribunal down in May 2014. http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/upgrading-tribunal"
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,Sorenthaz,2,Mon Jul 13 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"People keep saying that as do I but you are wrong about them wasting money on PR, at least from their point of view.  Riot Game (-s because they aren't actually making games... they can barely hold on to one) is basically a marketing company. People pouring money into the games industry aren't gamers they aren't interested in the quality of a game (because they can't judge it) or whats actually working or isn't, they are interested in stats. And stats is what Riot does and fakes (as do many other companies) which is basically what marketing is today. There are companies with great products and there are companies with great PR. You don't need both. People lap up this science talk like King Julian because they have no clue whats going on and what Riot says looks good on paper.  The sad part is Riot could have gone the other way and reinvest all the money the got into their only product. Not even ""instead"" of LCS but despite of LCS - Make and focus on a quality product, be insanely lucky and make tons of money AND do LCS. Not the other way around make LCS and keep the game barely running while you focus on other shit. They didn't which is why they haven't gotten money from me in years. I like games, I give money to companies that make actual games not ideas."

RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,MashCojones,2,Tue Jul 14 20:33:39 2015 UTC,What solutions have being elaborated as you so eloquently said because every system they put in place just makes the game more frustrating. I really do not need a game company trying to parent me the initial features that let you just mute someone was more than enough. But why isn't that the preferred option.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,holyvoli,0,Wed Jul 15 07:00:57 2015 UTC,"Mute is still the short-term option. obviously mute isn't enough, because flamers will continue to flame in all their games regardless if they get muted or not. So why force all people to mute someone when you already know who the flamer is that causes people to mute in the first place?  I don't see how any of the systems made the game more frustrating if you don't leave and/or don't insult.  I'm not saying all systems implemented were the best fucking ideas ever, but saying it made things worse is simply wrong."
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,MashCojones,3,Wed Jul 15 07:34:07 2015 UTC,Here is the thing people who play this game refuse to understand. The muse function is the only function you need in game you say flamers are always going to flame but this might be true but the person on the receiving end has as much power to stop it at any time. I don't understand why everyone in this game love to feel like they are victim of some sort. When they have always had the power to stop the abuse. I am not saying flaming is right but it is never going to stop. The more resistricition riot puts in place the more creative people get with their flaming and trolling. I don't have to say a word in game to completely ruin 30-40mins of you life. At least when you could say what you wanted people had an outlet for their frustration with their team mates it may not be the correct way to deal with it but why do you care what a complete stranger on the Internet has to say about you.
RiotFreeLoL,3d2wnz,holyvoli,-1,Wed Jul 15 08:10:13 2015 UTC,"No one is arguing against mute mate. But if you already know that one person causes 90% of his teammates to mute him, then obviously he is the problem. So why let all future teammates mute him when you arleady know that it's him causing it?  Your solution is to treat symptoms but ignore the root of the problem, which is just stupid, especially long-term.   I am not saying flaming is right but it is never going to stop.    that's right, but you can reduce it. Ignoring the problem just isn't a solution.   I don't have to say a word in game to completely ruin 30-40mins of you life.   sure there are other ways of destroying games, but I still don't see why that is a reason to ignore the easy detectable flamers.   why do you care what a complete stranger on the Internet has to say about you.    most people don't really care. But they just want to play an entertaining game. If they have to read annoying insults and have to mute then the damage is already done: the experience will be inferior."

He wasnt right in impersonating someone yes, but he knows that and now speaks for himself.  He does have some interesting ideas, when he talks about how few woman are casting events compared to men and just trying to explore why that may be.  He doesnt even answer the question, he just presents the idea to get other people to think about which is cool.  Just because this guy made a false persona in the past doesnt mean anything he says now is irrelavant and should be discredited on the basis of that.  While as Ann Pragg he was known as someone with good insight and ideas about the Korean scene and an up and coming writer.  He doesnt suddenly have worse ideas and bad analysis or become a bad writer just cause he is no longer writing under the Ann Pragg name.  People need to find out whether theu liked Ann Pragg and her content because of her analysis and writing and things as he said on twitter or just because she was an attractive female.  If they liked her because her writing, analysis and quick wit, they can like the guy behind the persona for the same reasons.  If they liked her only cause she was an attractive female then your out of luck and may feel duped and more unwilling to give him a chance.  This theme is something both his and Richard's articles explored and an interesting thought experiement and social commentary."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,poookie13,-3,Sun Jul 12 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"Going to write an essay here since this is close to my heart.   how few woman are casting events compared to men   Very good reason for this. Riot doesn't particularly like female casters and sees them more in a hosting role. We can talk about it within the community but the truth is that the company is enforcing the stereotypes. This needs to change if the community as a whole talk about it, not just women. I used to follow Ann Pragg, like I follow Thorin and RL now. But I never once thought she's a great addition to the community as an example for women in an environment that desperately needs more women in it. I'm a filthy casual so I'm probably not qualified to talk about her skills or her insights into the game, but she(he) probably has real talent in writing and in esports(which a lot of people saw inspite of Ann's persona). I don't follow Sam's story now though, but I want to talk about the bigger issue of women in esports and what effect Ann had from the perspective of a woman.  Did she have good opinions? Perhaps. But her attitude was definitely off-putting. If anything, she made the case worse for women in the industry. She tried to be a ""female Thorin"" except she just turned out to be a rip-off of Thorin that happened to be a girl. In those days even Thorin was a bitch to follow on twitter. I don't know if anyone remembers this, but he used to be a lot worse. He's really mellowed out now and makes jokes about everything. I still follow and unfollow RL depending on the childish fits he throws every now and then because hell, I don't need that vitriol in my life.  I guess what I'm saying is that its hard to talk about a person's work separate from the person themselves. Especially in an industry where there is such a skewed demographic. As a relatively ""prominent"" person in the industry, Ann Pragg had to be aware of the precedent she was setting for future women coming into the industry(he seems to champion that there's not enough women in esports, but then refuses to treat them differently, except he just impersonated a woman to be treated as such).   I know its not nice to have to be a role model, but this is the burden that many women have in many fields. ""Why can't you just be yourself?"" you ask? I'm not asking the women to be anyone else, just to realise that they are the leaders in this field and in order to encourage more women to have the courage and take part of the community, certain efforts need to be made until there is more of a balance. You can't just say ""yeah, there need to be more women"" and then sit on your hands and refuse to create an environment where they would feel more welcome.  So being a prominent ""woman"" in lolesports comes with a certain level of responsibility. One that people like Sjokz carry off immensely well. If you're a woman and you're going to act like ""one of the guys"", be abrasive and make sexually offensive statements, you're basically telling prospective women that this is the sort of behaviour and attitude you need to be successful in esports. But none of that was taken into account by Sam. Which is my real peeve about this issue. Sam created a representative from a minority of the community just to turn around now and pretend he cared about how they were treated in the scene? This is like that Rachel Dolelzal case in America. Did Ann Pragg actually take away the opportunity from a real woman who could have been in her place and entered the scene in the same role? We'll never know, but that's one option.  From my perspective it really did seem like she wanted to cause a ruckus just to get more attention. Like RL and Thorin do(and that's become almost their entire personality, even if that's not the way they are IRL). I used to think: just great, one more woman in the industry who wants to act like a total twat to get noticed. I stopped following her around the time she made some sexually inappropriate comments, but maybe that's just me being over sensitive.   And the article is right. I myself, am scared of airing views because of the backlash I would probably get. Just look at the way Frosk is treated. And this is a problem. There is a lack of women. There is also a torrent of abuse when people realise you're a girl interested in video games and actually have any sort of opinions.  Typically, there are two ways girls handle this response. Either they try to completely ungender themselves, so that basically you can't tell that they are female(I am guilty of this 99% of the time). I.e. act like a guy. OR they brandish their gender like a badge and look for attention (even negative attention) so that they become noticed in the industry. Think Kaycetron etc. Its sad that there are only two reactions to this, but in order for that to change, women in this industry need to stop being made a mockery of by men impersonating them. Create an environment where they feel welcome in the industry and let them show their talents.   Ann Pragg did not help women in the industry in any way. She condemned them. Now whenever a woman will step forward, her real identity might be under question because of Sam's actions.  EDIT: Can people try participating in the discussion instead of blindly downvoting? Fucking hell."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,maurosQQ,3,Sun Jul 12 21:12:07 2015 UTC,Do you have any proof that Riot is actively trying to deny female casters/analyst on broadcasts? Or deliberately chosing men over women?
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,zenxbear,-1,Mon Jul 13 07:55:12 2015 UTC,"Richard Lewis talked about that, but only as circumstantial evidence for Chinese lol scene, which apparently has knowledgeable female analysts.  The problem is you are waiting for something like leaked emails, or literally a video recording or a top manager overtly dismissing the female caster/analyst for being female. Which will probably never happen. It also never happens in other industry, because people aren't usually that stupid to leave trace of their bigotry."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,maurosQQ,4,Mon Jul 13 10:04:06 2015 UTC,I know that he talked about that in the case of Froskurinn. But he made it sound like he had evidence. Emails or whatever.  But as long as their is neither evidence nor a testimony that backs up these claims I dont think its right to accuse Riot of this. I mean just the lack of female casters or analysts is not telling us much about possible intentions of not recruiting them.
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,poookie13,-1,Mon Jul 13 10:11:11 2015 UTC,"I have none except RL's word for it in one of his videos. And usually I do take his words with a grain of salt, but the fact that there are hardly any female casters and that Frosk had to fight her way to her position, doesn't make it seem so unlikely. I mean she has said some questionable things on her twitter, but its not like Joe or Deman are completely faultless in their behaviour either. Again, this is just my opinion, and if my facts are wrong, I stand corrected."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,sentientmold,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:13 2015 UTC,How many other female casters that are regarded as skilled and held back by Riot can you list?  The pool of esports casters is super tiny to begin with. Despite RL saying that Riot would never put a female in a caster position she was brought on board.   Does the fact that there aren't any (that I know of) professional female lol players in lcs/lck/lpl mean that they are being discriminated against?
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,poookie13,-2,Mon Jul 13 18:15:56 2015 UTC,"How many other female casters that are regarded as skilled   That's the point, we won't ever know how many, if Riot is indeed is holding people back. But lets suppose that that assumption is wrong. Lets assume that Riot is in no way influencing or preventing women from casting. Then we'd have to look at it in proportion to the community size. We can't expect 50:50. We'd expect something reflecting the society interested in the games. League is about 10% women gamers. So we'd expect 10% of casters to be female.    Despite RL saying that Riot would never put a female in a caster position she was brought on board.   I doubt even Riot said they would ""never"" put a woman in casting. I'm not trying to demonise Riot. I think they just held stereotypes of what suited women more. That is not for them to decide. Also, did you not notice how hard Frosk had to fight to get into casting? They literally ignored her for a year before putting her there and only when PapaSmithy left for OGN. This is not only verifiable from RL but from Thorin as well. What about the female casters/analysts in China that Riot had an issue with?(again, not provable, but the fact that this is even a story/rumour means that somewhere something must have happened).  Now lets get to numbers. Take a look at this. These are the ""small pool"" of LoL casters. http://lol.gamepedia.com/Category:Casters  There are 43 casters. 1 is a woman. And she got the job this year. This is not even the full list since I know of at least one female caster for LPL in Chinese but that won't change the ratios much, so lets ignore it. The general statistics for LoL are that 10% are female players. Therefore out of 43 people, we expect 4 casters to be female. Is there not some bias somewhere? It can't be possible that women play the game but are just not interested in a job in esports and only men are? Still does not prove any maliciousness from Riot's side, but its interesting at least to note this difference. There's something else holding them back, imo, and that's the attitude of the community towards women.  Look at any study on gender biases. Lets take the one for news anchors and expert analysts (I took this one since its most similar to casting and analysing in the public light): http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/academics/communications/research/vol4no1/04irvinejspring13.pdf Men are given an ""expert"" role much more than women (as much as 50 men to 15 women in the same area). There's a great need for more women in politics. Yet why are all the men presidents when half the women are voting as well? The answer in this area is known. Men are always seen as more authoritative. They know what they are doing and they seem to be cool under pressure. Women cry(reference Tim Hunt). And this leaks into esports as well. This is a world issue, not only an esports issue.  Now just stop to think of what the community reaction would be around a female caster in the LCS. Think of the abuse. Why do I know this? Because of the way Pansy is treated in CS:GO. Because of gamergate and because of how women are sexualised over the internet. Until we all change our mindset, this will not change either.   Does the fact that there aren't any (that I know of) professional female lol players   Same reasons as above. We know that 0.1% of the top league players are playing competitively. 10% of the users are female - that equates to 0.01% pro women gamers. Who do we have right now? 1 or 2 from the west and about 10/12 in Asia. And Sirens depending on how loose your definition of competitive is. Underrepresented for sure but not by such a stretch. Are men more competitive? Sure! Just like the Mens Wimbledon is more competitive than the Womens. Men and Women's football... need I go on?   I feel like there maybe an underrepresentation of female players and that this is a problem with the community in general and their treatment of women rather than some real discrimination by the system. Women just get more abuse and are more sensitive to abuse than men (you know, because boys are told that men don't cry and no one looks twice when a woman cries... etc etc, age old problem etc.). You really do have to be thick skinned to have an online presence and women shy away from this more than men.  EDIT: My point is, just like in the previous post, this is a problem for both men and women to consider. We have to make the environment more encouraging for women, its simply not enough to sit on our hands and hope for more women in esports."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,SeeBoar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:54:51 2015 UTC,"herefore out of 43 people, we expect 4 casters to be female. Is there not some bias somewhere?   Completely wrong. Numbers don't work like that. Or are you going to complain that the ranking system is also bias and intentionally puts women at a lower elo? I doubt that 10% of challenger are females."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,poookie13,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"10% of the total player base. Since when does being a caster require Challenger rank? I guess all the casters are useless then!  I'm not sure from which part of my argument you're getting that the ranking system is biased and places women at lower ELOs. I'm making a general assumption from total numbers, I'm not saying this is definitely the case.   I doubt that 10% of challenger are females.   Where's your evidence of this?  There are 200 challenger players. 20 are EXPECTED to be female. Not that they are, they are expected. If you can provide some numbers to deny this, then I'll be happy to accept it.  Notice that I'm not arguing that there might be other extenuating circumstances. No motivation due to social biases(most women don't discuss playing league among their friends, its not as much of an obsession as it is with men). Behaviour of the online environment(see comment above).   You complain ""thats not how numbers work"" when you've provided no numbers yourself and are criticizing my general conclusions. I'm not even saying women are better than men, you're the one doubting their ability to be in challenger. And unless you can give me proof that they are worse than men, I'm not convinced."
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,SeeBoar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"Can you post some numbers that 10% are females?  I don't have hard evidence but there has been an AMA by a ""female"" challenger player who quickly blew up and was even sent offers by teams such as C9 to join the streamer network and it turned out it be a man. If there was a female challenger player she could very quickly amass a large following through league and if playing in challenger you'd think they take the game seriously and would love the opportunity. My point on how you think numbers work. Just because 10% of the playerbase is female how does that equate to 10% of the casters being female? That isn't how numbers work. Majority of the casters are diamond but diamond are only 2% of the playerbase so should only 2% of casters be diamond?"
RiotFreeLoL,3d0oc8,poookie13,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"For sure. Here's an infograph. http://majorleagueoflegends.s3.amazonaws.com/lol_infographic.png   Majority of the casters are diamond   Not even remotely true. Look at the casters and then look at their rank. There are silvers, golds, plats. Heck some of the best (you know who I'm talking about) are unranked. Riv just went through his gold promos. Deficio and Krepo has even said that their job requires so much time they don't get to play ranked that much which reduces their rankings. So therefore, these people could be higher, but being diamond in solo queue doesn't help their job. They just need a flow and feel for the game. Ranking and casting have very little to do with each other.  Again, I'm talking in general. If 10% are female. IDEALLY we'd expect 10% of females in each rank. So 10% of 200 is 20. But we all know there aren't 20 female ranked players (!!!!ASSUMPTION!!!!). Lets say there's 5, at a stretch. That's still 2.5% of them. Sounds reasonable given other factors that I noted before.   I'm not sure what you're arguing for? The system is cheating the female players? Or my calculations are wrong and that there is no bias at all, and women are just bad at the game?  I can't think of any other easier way to model this. Maybe they are distributed in a gaussian fashion? The only reason I didn't do this calculation was because I wanted to keep it simple and that the entire population is already almost gaussian (Source: http://www.lolsummoners.com/stats). But remember that its skewed to the left, so that makes the numbers even more small. Also, in this case, this makes females in that group even more unlikely just by the maths. The people in challenger are the outliers(0.01% of the population) which means the probabilities are even lower.  It could just be the maths(external factors/society/etc) OR it could be that women are worse at league of legends, right? Which I assume is your point. My point is, this difference is worth noting. Why should the ratio of men to women be 9:1? It shouldn't. Half of the people on the planet are women, but why are there such abysmal numbers in league of legends?   I'm not here to blame the system or demonize Riot. I was making a point about the proportion of women and that something must be done to change this. Which begins with the attitude of the community towards them. Take a look at your example, and take a look at Ann Pragg. If the community wants women to join their ranks, they are going to have to stop impersonating them (for views and money) and they are going to have to re-evaluate their treatment of women (e.g. women streamers). At the same time women already in the industry have to be careful of the personas they choose. Kaycetron springs to mind."

But the other things that were changed improve the build paths and build flexibility of mages, so basically, WORTH!"
RiotFreeLoL,3ckqvl,Hurenschande,3,Wed Jul 8 18:21:00 2015 UTC,also something important is the new rabadons. now it scales better with ap but there is less of it. so i bet that the new meta of mid laners will be mages with tear wich will fit right into the poke style of play. also ap smite ez can now go serath instead of hourglass.

Even if not worth to heal by minions, is great against monster and champs (plus ap/cdr). On the other hand I feel like you need a void before a rabadon and that is kinda weird, especially if the other team is not staking mr but hp (which is kinda the path build now). I see the late game potential but feel like really early game is kinda weird/week. On the tear side, i like the extra ap, but since you stack it on spell cast and not like manamune on AA and spell, there is almost no point really rush it on lane imo. again.. this is how i fell now without really testing it maybe im wrong maybe im right :P"
RiotFreeLoL,3cjl64,lolstools,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is fairly well done and very good for your first time doing analysis. Some criticism is that at the beginning of your article in my opinion you should have walked through the pick ban better, talking more pick by pick in order to draft both a composition that each team if comfortable on and a composition that does well vs the other team. Talk about power picks and where they were picked in the draft.   Besides that at times you criticize some plays RNG made that gave them a different advantage such as RNG missing dragon opportunity when they actually didn’t have vision of rek’sai and wanted to deny the experience from rumble. Skipping the dragon forces rumble to go top for farm where they are able to keep the 2v1 lanes going, which for RNG is really good because of RNG’s week laning phase vs aggressive lane of naut + kalista. There are a few other things that I believe were traded rather than given up that you should think about.   At the end of the game I believe you should take a step back and think of from what the teams win conditions are and how they can achieve it."

In EU she's the most banned champ and joint highest pick/ban with Alistair - but unlike Ali has a 63% winrate across 28 games. Its even worse in NA where she's P/B 92% of the time.   I don't think the nerfs are even that crippling tbh, all its done is reduce her early game bullying a tad and made kiting whilst still wrecking the enemiy chasing you harder. Riot havn't hit her core aspects at all - her ulti is still as useful as ever, she can still kite and be relatively safe and she can still hope around and dodge fucking everything you throw at her short of a Karthus ulti (if you play her right).

Isn't that the whole point of an auto-attack?  To apply damage without the need for a ratio?  A lot of champions (Vayne etc.) have damage caps on Monsters. They could have simply done that instead of hitting her late game carry potential even harder.  Now instead of ""I'll build BotRK or BT/Runaan's first because it's a cool alternative build!"" Kalista is going to become a ""I can only go the non-crit ADC build because my autos do -10% damage."".  ADCs with alternative build-paths always get put on lockdown. It kinda sucks."

If the problem of negativity is this common. Can you still say people are toxic?

When looking at what this toxicity even is its ranging from heavy swearing to just getting reported because u gave a helpful advice which got misintepreted. yeah and u know what the thing thousand of games already discovered working for such a thing the mute button gets treated like its not there...players already can protect themselve from words....what they cant protect themselv against is actuall gameexphurting behaviour ""trolling"" ""afking"" ""purposely destroying the game for someone"".... so far u can say riot opened a problem which had already the perfect solution...... a mute button and never came up with anything which even remotely improved any aspekt of what they wanna go against"

Riot claiming that they uncovered the cheaters and taking credit for it isn't fine because they didn't do anything; they neither uncovered the cheaters, nor did they pay someone else to do so for them.

EU - Top 2-3 teams FNC, H2k, ORG better then any NA Team.   None of the NA teams have a chance against a BO5 format world wide talent pool. Even with the imports they have better solo q, better talent pool, more players everywhere outside of NA, so even when you bring players over they get weaker not stronger."

Fnatic  KR - TOP 2-3 SKT seems stronger but KOO and CJ would lose against FNATIC, would be close between KOO and FNATIC.  Rest   KR - Pretty badly, H2K and Origen have a chance of making 4th but they'd be in the 5-6-7 places most likely, the other teams would get stomped most of the time  Fnatic  China - TOP 2-3, Qiao Gu(and other teams) looking good and EDG maybe back on form. OMG is beatable and has been somehow incosistent so top 3 maybe 2nd, don't think so.  Rest   China - H2K and Origen around 6-7-8 the others would be bottom 4.  Fnatic   NA -First, best team by far.

RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,OviLOL,2,Sun Jul 5 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like Fnatic would have more troubles than one thinks against top KR and CN teams, just because Huni would face toplaners that are equally good or even better.  Huni has no real competition atm in EU. I dont see him carrying that hard against Marin, Smeb, Trace, Koro1, Flandre, Acorn, Flame, Duke etc."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,maurosQQ,0,Mon Jul 6 13:14:49 2015 UTC,Well he's better than most of those and has done really well against Marin at MSI winning lane. Even Monte considers him a world class toplaner. Which teams more precisely would give Fnatic any problems? Except SKT and EDG.
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,OviLOL,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"Snake, LDG, KOO I would say.  And I think its hard to say if Huni is better than those, I mean we saw him at MSI and thats it, the rest of the season we see how he beats up EU tops."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,maurosQQ,0,Mon Jul 6 13:34:44 2015 UTC,"He's dominating EU Lcs so It's fair to say he's really good. I think Fnatic as a whole would beat Koo and Snake, wouldn't know about LGD."

RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,maurosQQ,0,Mon Jul 6 13:45:46 2015 UTC,"Well his first international tournament and i believe he was top lane MVP. Another thing to consider is the fact, that Fnatic did improve within 2 days. So yes they lost to EDG pretty hard. But EDG is on the same level as it was back in MSI. Fnatic is like 50% better team. And they just sought experience. So if he was able to carry even facing Marin. You can't say he wont be able to carry facing him or others again. And we haven't seen other lanes lose or lose in some stomp like fashion."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,Hondlis,0,Mon Jul 6 15:44:04 2015 UTC,Koro1 was better than him and Marin isnt even the best top in Korea.
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,maurosQQ,0,Mon Jul 6 15:45:34 2015 UTC,Marin is the best laner of the top laners in KR so if Huni goes even in lane against Marin that's enough.
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,Nordic_Marksman,0,Mon Jul 6 16:25:00 2015 UTC,I dont think so. I think Smeb and Trace are more consistent and Duke carries harder.
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,maurosQQ,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"TBH I think FNC would do poorly vs top 3 LPL teams like EDG/LGD/IG (maybe less on this 1 not sure, its possible that QG could make it over them if Kid doesn't get his form back but until playoffs I'm not putting them any higher especially since they just got stomped by LGD in Demacia Cup while LGD had a sub in). I think stylistically the matchup plays into favor of the Chinese team's skirmish and teamfight abilities. When top lane tp plays by Huni fail, FNC is in for tough shit.   That game at MSI vs EDG was one of the most one sided stomps in the entire tournament barring wildcard, and lets not forget that they didn't perform particularly well vs AHQ either but that's mainly because Westdoor bodied Febiven and then the rest of FNC."

RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,Hurenschande,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"KR by far most powerful. SKT will be unstopable if Faker continues his rampage. Koo tigers also look scary in comparision to other teams, espacially because they improved their early game (Main weakness during their winning streak). I think those two teams are going to worlds for sure.  Can't really say much bout CN, because I'm not watching everything, but I hear it is improving in macro play, which sounds good for them. (Also, tons of questionable roster moves! (Dandy top, Deft subbed etc)  LMS is probably #3 of the regions, but same as CN, don't watch it.  EU has atm the best western team at #1 and two solid teams with H2K and Origen.  NA is atm a rather strange region. ATM the best teams are Gravity and TL, because they prepare, continue to improve themself and have really good strategies (eg GV vs TSM!). Gravity has probably the best chance to get #1 with their actual performance. TSM is struggling, their macro-level play is not as good as in spring. Also IMO they are to one-dimensional aka Bjergsen-centric, which in international play can result in some huge problems. As you don't really have a second good carry and agaisnt good Midlaners. Other teams I still don't think will have the possibility to be good, perhaps TIP, but they are sometimes really shaky..."

The only thing I know is the those top 4 teams all seem to be performing consistently well domestically right now.  Last summer, the top NA teams looked to be at similar strengths and we had a decent showing at Worlds, so I'm hoping that this year is a repeat of that."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,Yoogoplop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:36:29 2015 UTC,"From NA- NA makes a lot of mistakes still, constantly throwing the game back and forth, which is why they feel strong going into scrims with international teams where those teams are trying high risk plays constantly and/or pushing their limits, but get cremated on stage where the teams play lower risk and more calculated.  I'll be surprised if any NA team gets out of groups this year unless they find RNGesus and get in an easy group. I still don't think NA understands how to get good practice, and NA solo queue is troll central. If you have any question about this, TSM, a team with the most infrastructure in the region, had to sit down and tell their players that it was a job and practice was going to start being like an actual job... only weeks ago. (TSM documentary episode where Loco has a team meeting about not fucking around during practice.) This almost blew my mind, but by the way you see games get thrown with 10k gold leads in NA it's not surprising.  KR is more controlled play, the top teams push objectives, play to their comps and item power spikes. Mostly proactive plays around the power spikes too, the stronger teams (SKT, KOO, Jin Air and CJ sometimes) seem to stay proactive with map movements and pressure. They know they're going to make moves before the items come out, they plan prior and make sure vision is set up and a rotation can happen. Mathematically the most sound region, if LoL was a game you threw into a simulator to find out who would win, KR would win.  CN is a very entertaining region to watch. The regular season is a bit of a shit show sometimes, I don't think the top teams actually try in half the games.  They most likely view it as a way to push their own limits and test new comps/champions which can get a bit trolly.  However the talent pool in this region is massive right now and even the shit shows have the most incredible plays you'll find in league.  CN's players tend to be very mechanically gifted and can outplay their way to wins which makes them a threat to KR's calculated play.  They're very proactive with making plays and like to dictate the pace of the game.  They struggle when they're made to react rather than be the catalysts for action themselves. The high risk style they play is also very punishable, but it also allows them to snowball games out of control very quickly. Any of the top 6-8 teams from China would make most NA teams look like 5 random people you grabbed from solo queue. They punish the slow early play, especially when NA isn't good at playing safe like KR is. They've gotten much better over the past year with macro level map play though, which makes CN the region with the highest probability of taking down KR at worlds.  EU is Fnatic, H2K sometimes, and then a bunch of european's partying it up with that LCS money. Fnatic has a lot of talent on their roster right now, they can carry from every single position and have a veteran shot caller to boot.  I don't think they'll stay undefeated as most teams will put in a majority of their time preparing for them, and there will be teams that just take a game being a BO1.  I don't think any team in EU can touch them in a BO5, they have good drafts, and a good understanding of how to win the game once they're ahead. H2K, TSM, GV are probably around the same level, with H2K having a better understanding of the game with decent talent, GV having smart drafts and counterplay, and TSM being the average level of those.  TW/HK seems like CN's little brother.  The talent pool isn't quite as high, but the play styles are quite similar.  LMS may be even more aggressive to be honest, very centered around team fighting and skirmishing, the meta is in a decent place right now for them and it leads me to believe AHQ and YOE are probably above the NA teams right now, just because they're not afraid to make plays on the map. TSM and GV would contend with them in a BO5 due to decent reactionary play and this region being overly aggressive at times."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,matthitsthetrails,0,Mon Jul 6 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"Top 3 of EU > top 5 of NA, but NA's middle teams have more potential  than EU's middle teams imho.

Going forward(S6):  Unless some serious rosterbation happens, 4-10 of EU won't improve overly well. Origen will fall off is xPeke retires and they can't get somebody like Pepi to replace him. Fnatic and H2K remain firm 1/2 like TSM and C9 were for NA."

Not any further unfortunately. NA teams  tend to win by passively waiting for other team to make mistakes. International teams won't go for that."

I would say they are my favorite ""NA"" team but if you look the core of that team is imported from better regions."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,Hondlis,-2,Mon Jul 6 06:14:35 2015 UTC,"EU: FNC is good. The rest of their ""top"" teams are really unimpressive and have been making obvious and fundamental mistakes since Day 1. I see inconsistency as part of being a weak team, so can't think highly of the rest of that bracket.  KR: Most of the top 5ish teams in this region could stomp any collection of NA/EU teams. Some silly mistakes, but they come the closest to a refined style of play in any region. If I only had an hour to watch League and couldn't keep up with multiple regions, I would watch LCK games.  CN: Less crisp than KR, but top couple of teams would still crush the best of NA/EU. Battles between top 2-3 teams are really enjoyable to watch, on par with LCK. It's the second-closest region to consistently producing a beautifully-played game."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,sorasonline,-1,Mon Jul 6 04:37:21 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if 9/3 with 9 decisive victories is inconsistency. And im pretty sure KT rolster or Najin e-mFire wouldn't stomp anyone in let's say top 3 from EU even from NA. They would most likely win against worse of top teams, but in very sweaty way. Jin Air on the other hand can deal with both ""tops"" excluding Fnatic, which would be on similar level as KOO, depending on what shape would they bring into the game. Becouse internationaly they are disasterous so far. So using phrases such as ""stomp"" is nonsense. But what is most important that in rock scissors paper of playstyles, chinese one is beating korea's as last international event showed up. Which is the same as EU is successfully developing."
RiotFreeLoL,3c83pi,sorasonline,-2,Mon Jul 6 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"""Stomp"" is probably being taken too literally. I'd say top KR/CN teams are strongly favored in a Bo3 or Bo5, and that FNC (or old-form C9, or TSM if they're super on-point) would have a good chance of taking a game or two. Granted, with recent leaks, I don't know how much of FNC's international success is entirely the team and how much is due to trading scrim information, but that's a black mark that won't fade any time soon.  I think we can argue about rock-paper-scissors meta all we want, but really it will depend on what actually happens: see TSM continuing to abandon Dyrus at worlds and getting totally smashed because their opponents were actually good at the game. We can predict, but ultimately we need more international games to see how each style performs, and then how each style adapts to its success or failure on the international stage."

Maybe korea has higher mechanical skill in the middle of the pack, but they showed they are vulnerable to chinese chaotic playstyle.  I would say EU would have better showing vs korean teams aswell, becouse they have similar playstyle as china. Im pretty sure Fnatic could bring very close games with top 3 korean teams, but would most likely lose to top 2 chinese but with high chance of beating 3rd. OG and H2K maybe would stand a chance or win vs 4-10 korea and like 6-10 top china teams. About NA im not that sure. Problem is there are top 3 NA teams and next week top 3 teams are totaly different. If that ranking settles down than top 3 would be on the same level as OG and H2K. But right now i cant say they will beat OG or H2K in bo5 becouse their performance is changing within days. And about korea and china... top 3 are out of league for NA."

RiotFreeLoL,3c7sce,Tourto,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad for GV vs TSM helping to show that Runeglaive Ezreal is only a problem if you don't know how to push early advantages and stop him from reaching the 40-minute mark. Too many games now (CLG actually giving us a textbook example beforehand) are complaints of how the Ezreal team stalled for a long time and then won. Newsflash, after stalling to 4-6 items on every champion, someone typically wins after a big late-game fight.  E: I imagine it like the changes in first pick/ban we've seen with Sivir, Kalista, Gragas, Rek'sai, Alistar, and Ekko. There's some adjustments here and there, but a lot of it is also teams learning to deal with those compositions and causing the champion to fall in priority."
RiotFreeLoL,3c7sce,sorasonline,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:27:10 2015 UTC,You are mostly right but the champions you quote in your second part are one of the most banned champions in competitive LoL. And i'd add that it takes a certain playstyle to beat a comp built around Runeglaive Ezreal and teams have to execute it perfectly for it to work.   So unless teams are certain that they can crush the early game and have a strong enough frontline/sustain/engage to kill the Ezreal really fast (there are few who come to mind). It will mostly be banned until the nerf imo.
RiotFreeLoL,3c7sce,sorasonline,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:38:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do think it's a fairly oppressive build right now because most teams aren't used to being put on a clock, or they're simply not good enough to do so without crumbling. If Riot wants to nerf it and call it a bug (which it is), that's fine, though if they nerf it due to the power that's flimsy.  I do expect Ezreal to be pick/ban until he's nerfed, much the way the other champions I listed still are. But, I expect better teams to learn to deal with him, while weaker teams will just use a ban."

Guaranteeing someone here is a lying fuck, I have no idea who it is tbh, so little actual evidence is in the public domain.   I could see this being a plan to fuck over Badawi equally as much as the guy just covering his ass and denying allegations. Until any actual evidence or admission of guilt comes forward, this shit just seems redundant."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,ihatemalzahar,7,Thu Jul 2 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how anyone would ever approach people like Bjergsen once, let alone twice with star players on other teams.

Nothing seems to make sense, and I'll wait for Renegades' second response to believe anything, and even then I may wait."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,ZirGsuz,9,Thu Jul 2 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"So much shit slinging is going on with no evidence at all. Also, who gives a fuck if there's evidence? He's still being unfairly punished by ex post facto law.  Why would Badawi even approach Bjersen? Any idiot would know Bjergsen isn't hopping off the TSM hype train.  Why would the LCS owners band together for such a foolish and childish series of statements?  What the fuck is Travis doing sucking everyone's dick and publishing their opinions about the matter? Who gives a fuck what Ja Rule thinks.  Who actually believes that Badawi was trying the poach half the LCS? Because it sounds to me the the LCS team owners really do believe it.  As far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed since Badawi issued his last statement, with chatlogs, on Reddit."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,cannyOCE,2,Thu Jul 2 03:47:48 2015 UTC,"The most hilarious one is where he interviewed TiP, and they basically said ""We have had no contact with Badawi, but we believe..."". Like fucking seriously Travis? Then why the actual fuck are you interviewing them in the first place facepalm"
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,Sikletrynet,2,Thu Jul 2 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"This my opinion to answer your questions.  I don't think that Badawi approached Bjerg. If there is proof to show that he did then I'll believe it. But, my thoughts are Reginald is doing what he always does: play the victim. He is hyper abrasive to everyone, but as soon as someone lashes out at him, he cries like the world has cheated him. I can't believe his bullshit anymore; however, there are people who will: hardcore TSM fans. Why would he do this? This would outrage the hardcore TSM fans the most to know that their star player was ""poached"" by some new guy. What would bring Reginald to do such a thing? My guess is as follows: Reginalds gets money from Riot and needs to follow their orders to retain its spot in the LCS. The LCS means publicity for his brand. I don't think TSM has really established itself as strongly in other eSports, like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. So, with the loss of an LCS spot, TSM profits would sink hard.   Now this is speculation, but I think TSM has some dirty laundry that Riot could air out anytime and will air out if someone from TSM doesn't follow what they say, Reginald. TSM has been in the League scene long enough to have some kind of fuck up that has been covered up or can be used as leverage against. They have never had anything pressed against them, which raises my suspicions considering how strict the LCS rules are, and how there are moments of their players acting unprofessional on streams or other social media going as far back as Chaox.   Pretty much all of these organizations that are going against Badawi with their I-don't-have-proof-but-here's-what-I-can-remember-durrrrrr bullshit, are big names with much to lose if they go against the grain of Riot because they too have dirt on their players. On Curse/Liquid, I've heard from a few streamers that some of their players would abuse narcotics such as Vicodin or various uppers. I think if you can guess who I'm referring to. I'm sure Riot is aware of this and would use it to create pressure if they need situations like this.  Why is Travis sucking their dicks? He is the only journalist who can interview Riot employees. Watch any of his more recent interviews and you'll notice they're shit. He doesn't press for any kind of information. In one instance, he does an interview with Lemonnation, and asks about the structure of C9. Lemon's like oh the structure is fine. Travis is like, oh, that must be a good enough answer. He doesn't follow up or get any details. He doesn't do journalism, but quasi-press releases. He's in Riots pocket to reveal, but not to inform; because of that, he is releasing this collection smear articles with empty quotes to look like they hold validity. But when looked at closely, at best, they are hearsay and at worse they come across as spoiled, high-school douchbags.   For me, the issues of Chris Badawi and his poaching is something I couldn't care much about. What is disgusting, interesting and holds me to this subject is what this means for eSports: -The allegiance of an all boys club in League of Legends -The repercussions this will have on further rulings.  -The direction the League of Legends community is headed. -The integrity of articles and information produced by teams and content creators. -Who will remain in this community (Professionals and enthusiasts) -Why anyone would considering invest in a product where its leading producers of content create this."

So they got angry or scared of what was said, so whoever he spoke to, even if it was just a social 10-min conversation, got blown up into this.

Badawi breaking rules or not is irrelevant at this point. The ban was already issued. In order for RNG to even exist in LCS it would be without him having ownership stake. You can look at him as shady, but this is a concrete attempt by others to drive him out of the community.

RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,URASUMO,2,Thu Jul 2 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"So the competing theories are badawi contacted these star players to discuss their contracts in the interests of the players - essentially ensuring that the players are informed of their circumstances and potential - and this angered the other owners who then launched a smear campaign with only two incidents to cite or badawi is an ass covering schemer who actually did repeatedly break LCS rules.  As a fan of the esport, I can't say either is particularly appealing."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,kavinh10,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"it is funny how all of these allegations never went into Riots initial investigation, and suddenly all this comes out. It's seems that the team owners are trying to push Badwadi out more because he was too polarizing and that he actually wanted to help the players."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,andinuad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"I think the same. We still dont know ""for sure"" whats the reason  behind all those owners wanting to publicly ""share their history"" with badawi."
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,TaiTay,4,Thu Jul 2 17:09:28 2015 UTC,if it was just reginald and the TL owner smearing him then it wouldn't look so bad considering how controversal they've been in the past towards third parties. but the one that makes me suspect badawi might be in the wrong or at least involved in some aspect in what's being alleged against him is the c9 owner coming out out and claiming he tried approach yusui while not contracted but claiming he already had locodoco involved.   Jack from c9's someone who endorsed Richard Lewis who was hated by the rioters and half the community so i can't see him doing it due to peer pressure.
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,kavinh10,2,Thu Jul 2 09:39:51 2015 UTC,Good point.
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,Sorenthaz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:57:58 2015 UTC,RL talked about it on trash talk. Apparently when badawi approached yusui he wasn't under contract and badawi wanted to know if he already had plans. Keeping in mind that this happened back when there was no fucking rule in place that forbid him to do stuff like this anyway. Also jack worked for tsm in the past..
RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,squarezero,2,Thu Jul 2 12:01:29 2015 UTC,ik what he said but if you read the post that came out the allegation wasn't that he poached yusui it even said he wasn't under contract at the time. It was that he tried to approach yusui under the guise that he had already successfully poached locodoco and would be using him to build a new team.  also ya Jack worked for tsm but that doesn't mean he's going to lie on their behalf just to smear someone he's shown he's more reputable then that if he cared about his reputation or circle of friends he wouldn't of endorsed the incarnation article RL wrote.

RiotFreeLoL,3bti9j,azureknightgx,3,Thu Jul 2 03:59:19 2015 UTC,"If only one of those people made a claim that he tried to poach a player, then I would just dismiss it. But TSM, TL, Winterfox all making claims makes it more believable. I'm not saying Badawi is guilty, but he sure isn't looking like a saint. I feel like reddit has jumped on the 'support Badawi' bandwagon without knowing all the behind the scenes details."

RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,jazekerdehypotheker,7,Wed Jul 1 16:05:11 2015 UTC,So they invest in curse voice but do not release a voice chat option for their own game? Riot continues to confuse me

RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,denyde_na,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"Well i am not talking about Riot producing a voice program for other games, but for their own. By buying into curse voice they acknowledge that voice chat can be important. So why refuse to implement it into your own game. They can still invest in curse voice. Maybe they just start telling people to use curse voice in their game. Thats probably the moment i just flip my shit"
RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,TaiTay,2,Wed Jul 1 15:28:57 2015 UTC,I would be very surprised if this doesn't mean that they are about to implement curse-voice or a product based on it into the client.
RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,NanaMadHouse,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think Riot is going to implement this as ""own"" client soon. With the worldwide troubles with lag/ping/packet loss is going to be another factor to check when something is not working fine. On the other side, at least till now, Riot show a strong interest on control what they call ""player behavior"" and a in-client voice chat will banish all they effort on that since is way more complicated to report someone by ""verbal abuse"", ""harrasment"", ""bully"" and what ever you want to add since you lack of hard evidence (note: I'm not saying that the chat is a good way to prove some thing but w/e).  Personally I think a in-game voice chat could or could not be a great addition. That is one of those thing that till you don't try can't really measure the goods vs the bad imo."

RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,ekjohnson9,3,Wed Jul 1 15:41:38 2015 UTC,VoIP for League would be a good thing.
RiotFreeLoL,3brcks,FrozenTheory,0,Wed Jul 1 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"In many past instances, however, Lyte takes the opposite stance. He's very adamant on his view that LoL does not need (or shouldn't need?) a VoIP system.  Edit: I understand that some parts of the LoL community don't care for whatever Lyte's desires are. My point is that when it comes to discussions about League and voice chat, Lyte's stance is firm while any other voiced opinions or responses are ignored and redirected to some irrelevant ""study.""  If Riot ever wants to conclude the ongoing chatter about whether or not to have voice chat added into the game, they would either implement it or collectively side with Lyte's veto of the idea and move on. It doesn't matter to you guys what Lyte wants but to Riot and seeing Lyte's past proposals come to fruition, it kinda does. I hope that expanded my point to be a little clearer."

Not only this, but he is playing in a meta that isn't even favorable for him which also seems to give credit to his play. Beast is also doing really well, so I think that an argument could be made for him here as well.  Also, what on earth do you see in mlxg that could possibly tie him for 5th?"

He probably found himself in the same situation a lot of women find themselves in, Richard said this once in one of his videos when he was talking about making some mistakes, his comment was about how he had apologised to some female presenters in the SC2 community because he originally said that it was easier to be female in the industry and while he said it's easier to get noticed, and get a 'leg up', it's much harder to go any higher, analysis desks, casters etc are generally only ever male.

RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,Borigrad,6,Tue Jun 30 20:14:15 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, Froskurinn shares a fair share of these traits, but the thing about her is it actually comes with the package of a personality outside of just shows (and now the big LPL broadcasts) - she's not really someone you'd idolize from afar, simply because of how in-touch this part about her makes it all feel  I'm glad she's not the kind that just goes about things like pretentious PR and keeps everything shiny-fancy-funny for ""the fans"", and it's really nice she's actually managing to gain her spotlight these days after all that time - maybe we'll get a bit more of a mixture of, you know, actual people in esports now, rather than PR figures, ex-players and memeists (be that in writing, coaching or commentary) :p"

RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,AthielianCosplay,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:56:20 2015 UTC,Hi its me Ann Pragg
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,TheDarkScorp,0,Tue Jun 30 22:27:49 2015 UTC,This story sounds like something out of the dark knight. Pretty cool.
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,koichul,3,Tue Jun 30 17:20:09 2015 UTC,I was waiting a conclusion of Ann Pragg is the hero we need but not deserve. Very good article and enjoyable. Kinda different from the usual analytical articles and it was a good one.
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,ppk7,0,Tue Jun 30 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"Not really surprised. First time I encountered Ann Pragg was on reddit, I saw him posting a lot of times and often agreed with his comments. They weren't bullshit circlejerk like almost everyone aroud here and he was iirc the first person I ever added to my friends list (which was more to recognise his posts in threads than really befriend him).  It was not until about a year later I heard about the twitter account and that he was a ""girl"". Already this seemed very strange, Ann Pragg never talked ""girly"" and when I followed him I was so certain he was a ~25 year old guy. I checked out some more of  Ann Pragg's tweets and it all just seemed very contradictory. Why would a girl with ""party girl"" type of photos be so held back and purely focused on E-Sports instead of doing some attention whoring on the side? Is she supposed to be world's most ironical person?  And now the truth is out, I guess I'm happier than before. Everything is as it should be and if he finally lifts off he will at least not be solely popular as ""the non crazy hot girl in esports""."
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,ubern00by,0,Tue Jun 30 20:47:57 2015 UTC,What the fuck haha.
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,c0ldflame23,0,Tue Jun 30 17:43:19 2015 UTC,Maybe someone should show some proof on who they are and when people ask for it not to be shouted down by white knights.
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,SeeBoar,0,Tue Jun 30 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"I used to follow Ann Pragg and this statement really sums the personality: ""Ann Pragg hurt no-one, truth hurts everyone.""  The only person that needs to tell you the truth hurts are hiding behind that statement so they can be a dick and don't have to be held responsible for being reasonable in their judgements."
RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,poookie13,-3,Tue Jun 30 19:13:13 2015 UTC,Pragg had engaged in numerous conversations of a sexual nature with people in the scene and had even acquired nude photographs of female players.   hehhhhh I wonder which female esports females naked pictures are soon going to be leaked

Although on the other hand, have you ever noticed how many people in the gaming communities claim to suffer from depression? that's okay and all, but none of those ever get help and I'll tell you why, because their depression is an excuse they use when they get in trouble for their other mental disorders that are carefully hidden from the outside world, just like in this lunatic's case."

RiotFreeLoL,3bnhf1,Edogawa1983,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:25:57 2015 UTC,So does Ann Pragg by your logic.  The difference is the guy who was behind Ann Pragg did not collaborate with anyone (such as the girls he used in his picture).   Meanwhile the guy who was behind MagicAmy actually teamed up with a girl. The girl didn't know shit about Hearthstone but was just a pretty face while he played behind the scenes.

RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,tomtumm,13,Wed Jul 1 07:24:12 2015 UTC,Sorry but I'll never believe a thing Brian Cordry says. He's a scumbag that will do anything to stay relevant.
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,Johnnygazer,8,Wed Jul 1 07:58:45 2015 UTC,this article pretty much just tells me that Winterfox's management are not very good at their jobs.. and their team got relegated as a result...
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,Edogawa1983,8,Wed Jul 1 08:08:07 2015 UTC,"If I can recall correctly Winterfox has a history of poor management, for example Altec not having a bed to sleep in. As well as the fact that Brian Cordry previously managed the train wreck known as Velocity Gaming."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,Priezly,6,Wed Jul 1 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"So yeah I spoke to Brian too he offered me anal sex in exchange for being new winterfox toplaner, he assured me that i would have a bed to sleep in though i may have to share it with him.  Obviously I have no proof as he was on the other side of a glory hole and my hands were too busy to get my phone out to record it. But I am sure it was him I was talking too as when he spoke the sound appeared to be coming out of his ass.  Edit: my story had several contradictions so needed to edit it."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,buzz182,8,Wed Jul 1 15:16:40 2015 UTC,Cordry's word means absolutely nothing. Maybe another 'in' from the GGA branding to throw more gasoline on the fire.
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,matthitsthetrails,2,Wed Jul 1 08:03:55 2015 UTC,why did travis go out of his way to interview nearly every lcs owner about badawi?
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,TaiTay,2,Wed Jul 1 08:16:11 2015 UTC,"Tbh from the way the story came about, the sudden willingness of regi to talk to Travis and all these owners some of whom are usually less than media friendly wanting to talk to Travis points to them coming to him with it.   It is not unusual for Celebrities to choose an interviewer they feel will be kind to them when a big story breaks. If you want to come of in a good light do you go to Travis or somebody that will ask the tough questions?"
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,buzz182,2,Wed Jul 1 15:11:50 2015 UTC,Well thats what also fucked it for them. Nobody takes Travis serious so nobody believes their accusations trough him. Imagine they would have chosen someone else for this story. Then again who else would have done this. Can't think of anyone
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,TaiTay,0,Wed Jul 1 15:20:07 2015 UTC,I'd guess since it all seems to been mouth-to-mouth it has been hard to find hard evidence leading to him wanting to show proof through the use of statements from several well known sources.
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,TaiTay,4,Wed Jul 1 08:21:09 2015 UTC,Well when even riot says that this is only he said she said i dont believe anything of it
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,buzz182,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:26:14 2015 UTC,"Well since they are doing an official ruling of course they need hard proof, but I would still believe that 6 LCS owners should be viewed as pretty believable evidence. Otherwise we should just stop believing all they are ever telling us?   It seems very unlikely that they are all ganging up on Badawi just cause they can..."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,TaiTay,3,Wed Jul 1 08:32:29 2015 UTC,Is just a typical Sivir comp Liquidsteve presses R and they all going running to Travis   edit: removed an E
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,Priezly,3,Wed Jul 1 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"Well, tsm tl and c9 are keeping together on pretty much all ocassions. Reginald also hates monte for some reason. Brian Cordry talks out of his ass all the time. Gravity belonged to Tl. TiP didnt say much at all. Adding to that Riot never needed hard proof for their rulings. They just do whatever they want. I just dont see anything that proves this to me Edit: https://twitter.com/LiQuiD112/status/616145992501493760 pretty much just saying: Do not fuck with me"
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,lurkedlongtime,5,Wed Jul 1 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"Also remember that C9 Jack previously worked for tsm, so it's not too hard to believe that they would collaborate with tl to smear Badawi's reputation."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,TaiTay,2,Wed Jul 1 08:50:52 2015 UTC,"So wait the running theory is that nearly every team owner teamed up to smear this guys reputation?  My question to that would be why? Even if that was the case (and i have no clue if it is) Why now? Havent they already won? Hes done. For 2 whole years for the LCS team owners.  Why care?   Because Badawi released the statement all other owners grouped up to force more PR.  I guess im just having trouble just finding motive.  For liquid? Sure. TSM... sure?  Everyone else we are making such large jumps in logic it just sounds unreasonable.  Such as ""Gravity was once owned by TL""  Okay.... but it was sold. Not TL anymore."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,ppk7,3,Wed Jul 1 10:20:46 2015 UTC,depends on who you ask. there are a shit ton of theories. i dont have any and i dont intend to make one. the whole thing just seems super fishy. But no badawi isnt done. He just cant have an official position in a team for the lcs. That just means he wont get that juicy riot money. He can still work for the team and in fact is doing so.
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,buzz182,2,Wed Jul 1 10:27:19 2015 UTC,"From my perspective the whole thing seems like the team owners are dick riding Riot. Riot is their employer. Riot found a way to fix their negative PR with the whole ruling mess, that it was a no doubt Riot doing whatever the fuck they want and we have to deal with it, by making their employees (team owners) start saying how bad is Badawi so the fanbases of the teams will listen to the teams not Riot. So mission accomplished Badawi was rightfully penalized/banned, team owners are good dogs now that they followed masters order."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,ppk7,3,Wed Jul 1 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think the plan has worked tbh The negative PR has increased imo. The only thing i can see them achieving from this is Chris saying fuck this shit i'm out.   I really hope Chris doesn't do this and proves them wrong though, not because i believe everything Chris has said or that I think he has done everything by the book but because even if he turns out to be full of it his ideas are good, i just hope his intentions are."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,jazekerdehypotheker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:25:02 2015 UTC,"I see your point and I also agree that Chris should stay for the same reasons. As for my speculation people after all of this will remember ""Chris the poacher"" and not how horribly Riot has abused their power and getting the owners on to this too. Even if he didnt try poaching (which i believe he didnt after reading all the facts) people will call him that."
RiotFreeLoL,3bq99d,kawkao,4,Wed Jul 1 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"Travis probably getting instructed by riot to do these interviews. After his massive 'succes' of the interview with riot Tryndamere and the spectacefaker debacle he tries to remain relevant. Just another puppet.   According to the winterfox owner: 'Our next conversations were all via Skype, and typically via voice rather than text chat' And then he continues to explain and it seems it was only 1 conversation through voice. And if his story is true then why arent they providing proof of date and time of the message that said ' I noticed I'd received a written message from Badawi: he told me that upon further reflection, he didn't think “it” would be in line with Riot's rules.'  Also the timing is very suspicious as there was a lot of backlash on the original ruling and then low and behold more things 'happened' that cannot be proven to make him look like a bad guy."

RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,FreEeSM,4,Tue Jun 30 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"It's really more basic than that.  Losing games is not fun.  Losing causes people to get angry.  Angry people are ""toxic"".  Being ""toxic"" makes others feel bad and it causes a negative feedback loop.  Matchmaking through whatever magical algorithms is designed to balance your win/lose rate to 50% which does not feel good but is ""fair"".  That means you're going to get upset half the time unless you have some zen-like mentality and just don't care about losing.  There's some misinformation in your rant too like premades all spamming report on one person is weighed differently by the system.  If you want the consistency of having good players on your team then you should be doing premades with people you know are good.  Experienced players queuing up with actual new players has always been a clusterfuck.  You simply can't balance that.  If the good player is on a carry type champion they can 5v1 and win the game themselves.  Also someone on a losing streak doesn't mean they are a bad player so if as you suggest you could dodge the person on a loss streak that's not really cool is it?"

RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,Zimzams123,2,Wed Jul 1 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts on some of your points...   The greatest cause of Toxic player is Riot. Riot promotes toxicity and racism in the game because they allow it to go on and have for years.   This is a really wierd statement to start off with. Instead of putting the blame on the players themselves, the structure of MOBAs as a genre or the low average age of Lol players, you instead claim Riot promote Racism? Look, i'm far from a Riot supporter, but what your saying here makes no sense man. You can't claim riot promotes racism simply for failing to solve a problem which hasn't been solved IRL or elsewhere in the world either. If anything Riot are annoyingly intrusive with their ""Toxicity reforms"", i really would not claim that they are too lax in this regard.    Riot does this for profit. They do not really care unless it starts to hurt the profit of the company, which it has not.   As is to be expected, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Quite the opposite in fact. The problem here arises when fanboys mistake Riot trying to grow a community to promote their game as being ""kind"" and ""caring"", instilling unwarranted loyalty in what ultimately is a company like any other.   Another issue is that if you are an experienced player playing with new players to the game in a premade group the experienced players normal elo will cause players to be put into a game they are not ready for.    Well this is always going to be unfair no matter which may you make it. Either the high elo guy is gonna stomp the opponent team, or the Low elo guy is gonna feel outclassed. I'm afraid that sort of situation is only curable by restricting the elos of people duoing.    Riot system doesn't account for an in game voice client to be used because they do not provide one   Good.   Introducing an integrated lol VOIP is a terrible, terrible idea. You literally just went over how Lol has a huge problem with ""toxic"" players, could you imagine how much worse it would be if you had to listen to those raging teenagers shout at you too? Unlike games like CS, talking isn't necessary to perform well (indeed if you think you climb elo by being a good team player you are doing it wrong), and in my experience clever use of pings and being a quick typer is more than enough to communicate efficiently what you want to say.  TBH i don't think Riot needs to or cares about actually improving the overall toxicity level of their playerbase. At the end of the day they only need a handful of idiots to make an example of (""smite"" in public), and some pro players to promote their ideology. Actually trying to make a worthwhile change in the wider community isn't just an impossible task - but is also counter-intuitive from a business standpoint as your essentially purging your own customers to make a very flimsy moral point about not saying bad words on the internet, which they'll promptly ignore anyway. And to be honest i'm ok with that. Id rather learn to deal with assholes on the internet saying bad words that have Riot constantly watching over us, banning anybody who even dares to utter the word Hitler."
RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,Zimzams123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"Players control certain aspects of their behavior but when a system is designed with flaws that drive people crazy for years then I cant blame the players just the poor design of the system that sets players up to rage. If you knew you were going into a game 5 games in a row with 5% chance of winning you blame Riot, the system covers up this by hiding the data that would show the flaws in it and this why people rage blaming other players instead of Riot. Its a good way to avoid the Rage being directed at the company responsible for creating the system. I am not asking to make an VOip system, I agree with you but it does cause you too be over run by a premade group of 4 using VOip, which causes anger at your team mates. I think Riot does a poor job in all aspects of policing the verbal chat system, first the pre game chat is recorded but not used in the Reporting system. Second they do not allow you remove the chat option out of the game only reduce it size, you can be reported for not communicating with team mates but they never make this clear, using smart ping enough communication? Do you have type into chat what your flash timing are to be a good team mate, never really explained. I do not believe in freedom of speech when it comes to a gaming environment that has a large age range should an eight year old boy be exposed to people 9-50 years old talking about life as they see it? Probably not in most cases it would be a very bad idea. If I was a parent and my son and I were playing and someone start spamming racist remarks and my son joined in I would have to set him straight on how to handle that communication better including removing his ability to play the game if needed. Riot can do a better job of managing in game chat."
RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,Moreion,2,Wed Jul 1 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"Speaking anecdotally first, i have never experienced anybody who thinks this way. I'm pretty toxic ingame myself - i;ve been chat restricted for like 150 games now (and counting). Is it ever because Riot has a poor system of punishment? no its caus someone else on my team is being a mong and doesn't like being called out for it. I think you seriously overestimate just how long the average user has been playing this game - and even then most people who've been playing as long as you claim to have been tend to be fairly jaded and just dont care either way anymore.  So you are saying in a team-based game that being a better team makes you play better? who'd have thought it? I think Riot does a poor job in all aspects of policing the verbal chat system,   think they do more than enough of that, again i'd argue most people can agree that just growing the fuck up is a better solution than requesting Riot go full 1984 on the ingame chat and instaban anybody using vaguely offensive terminology. first the pre game chat is recorded but not used in the Reporting system.  well you don't know that, obviously what Riot tells you what they do, and what they actually do, is completely different. In any case if you are really har up about it you can always say ""see pre-game chat"" in that little textbox in the report screen. Heck you could even sceencap it if you wanted to.  Second they do not allow you remove the chat option out of the game only reduce it size, mute?  you can be reported for not communicating with team mates but they never make this clear, using smart ping enough communication? Do you have type into chat what your flash timing are to be a good team mate, never really explained.  Ok, so i've been on the chat restriction thingy for like 150 games now (like i said earlier), and i can safely say that at least in Gold elo and below, basic messages and intelligent pings are defo more than enough communication. As for being reported for not communicating, i've never heard of anybody being punished for it so i dont see why you think this is an issue.  First off 8-9 year olds shouldn't be playing league. Its aimed at teens, and you'd be incredibly naive to think that even somebody age 13 can't handle a guy saying shit a few times. What you say about parenting is absolutely true, and is a job that should be left to the parents. We should not fall into the trap of making riot do the parent's job for them. End of the day if you play a game with 13-15 year olds then you have to accept them being immature pricks as part of that. Thats not a disease or the fault of anybody, its just children being children. Just ignore them and they'll eventually learn as part of growing up how to be socially acceptable."
RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,2defixx,2,Wed Jul 1 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have one question.  When you say ""a study"" what do you mean? When I saw the post I thought I would see some kind of facts or statistics or a method that lead you to your conclusions.  Sorry but all I read are opinions and (I don't wanna offend you) you only introduce yourself as a veteran player. What other credentials or knowledge gives you a clear idea about the toxicity in LoL. Why should I consider your ideas befor Lytes or any other season 1 player?

RiotFreeLoL,3boj5o,ubern00by,2,Wed Jul 1 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"Dodging doesn't lower your mmr, only removes LP. Plat is not what people usually mean by ""high elo"".  Much more important though is the fact that most people in Silver think its going to be better in Gold, people in Plat think its going to be better in Dia, low Dia think its going to be better in high Dia - notice a pattern? Its a case of the grass is always greener on the other side, its not - especially not in League.  There is very little tangible difference between tiers, dia5 is literally bronze again with better mechanics. There are new players who learn fairly quickly and for whom it is absolutely no problem to get into higher elo games. The last time I started playing League with a buddy of mine who was completely new to the game was before Riot introduced the duoq tier locking thing. We played to dia with his unranked account, which he bought. The first few games were pretty low mmr around 1.5k and after you pick up a couple of wins your mmr immediately jumps. Long story short after his first 10-20 games he played at plat mmr and did fine. I know that guy from playing other games competitively and thats why I had no doubt in my mind that this would work. He listens, he makes stupid mistakes once and learns, he min maxes - all of which very few people do in any tier - hence very little difference between tiers.  The frustration you talk about exits everywhere. I have played games where everyone I played with was in the top 1% of their measurable performance level and you will still have the same kind of frustration because there are 2 people who are the absolute best in the world and 15 who are only among the top 50 and the top 2 will complain about the rest. There is nothing Riot can do about that which is likely the reason they try so hard to remove your ability to judge some bronze or silver player based on their last 10 games. I will admit that among the lower tiers chances are vastly higher to get an absolute shiter on your team but this chance is 1/5 greater for the other team because you aren't a shiter, right? So it 1in4 for your team 1in5 for the other team, duoq and its down to 1in3.  Riot does kind of fake their efforts to battle flaming for financial reasons, which you said, but your reasoning here is sorta far out imo."

RiotFreeLoL,3bivrf,gahyoujerk,7,Mon Jun 29 18:54:45 2015 UTC,Or back in 2012 when Riot tried to make organizations sign a contract that stated if they had an LCS team they couldn't have a dota team. But then there was a huge public outcry so lol sorry but it never happened xd
RiotFreeLoL,3bivrf,Bit-Bi-Bit,11,Mon Jun 29 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"When Riot tries to impose restricting, insanely dumb clauses in their contracts, it's a ""misunderstanding"", or ""an error in communications"".  When a team owner breaks a rule that doesn't exist, it's ""malicious tampering"", and he's the worst person in eSports."
RiotFreeLoL,3bivrf,Haxenkk,7,Tue Jun 30 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"I think this whole situation is incredibly stupid.  I actually respect Steve a little less for actually pursuing this case to this degree.  Badawi didn't break the rule (after it was implemented) & even then, talking to a player about his options is not poaching.  It's having a conversation.  The problem with these teams are the lack of options for players.  Everything goes through the team manager, who informs players of their options AT THEIR DISCRETION.  There is nothing forcing the manager to tell the player about a potential opportunity.    But the dumbest part to me is charging someone for breaking a rule that wasn't implemented at the time of the action.  That's illegal in America for the federal government to do this, but I guess Riot knows better than them.  And as for Steve, saying he will come out with more information regarding this case ""for the good of e-sports"".  If you really gave half of a shit about e-sports, you would've let this sleeping dog lie and not pursued this poor man."

RiotFreeLoL,3bivrf,maurosQQ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Well if Renegades get into LCS I dont see why he should be banned from backstage. I mean we know that many people are in the backstage area that have no offical, riot-recognized function in teams, like for example analyst. If Badawi would still have a function in Renegades, that is not owner, coach or player, I dont see why he should be prohibited to go to his team."

Either there is more, or its just Riot being Riot.    I can appreciate their desire to protect their game...but there are so many more egregious problems out there, why MYM was allowed to have a team, why CW STILL has a team, despite their horrid ownership...and almost nothing is being down about them.  This guy makes a simple slip up, yes, he should have done the legwork to find out proper protocol, but he made a mistake, owned it, and was given an incredibly harsh punishment DESPITE not being part of the group the rules were made to enforce, until they were made, AFTER the fact...just boggles my mind."

It generates the same outcome (downvoting of original and abuse towards op of original) it is the same act (vote brigading by the mods definition).

So do we know if something happened to the jatt account? because admins usually just shadowban those people's account or their whole content, if there is any content to ban.  Whilst I agree that this can also be considered vote manipulation, I see a substantial difference between this one and the rlewis one: the rlewis tweets had nothing positive or productive in it. IT was essentially ""look this idiot"" over multiple tweets. Whilst you could say this also about this tweet it is also undeniable that the person who is the center of the discussion provides additional information and insight into the topic.  So jatt arguably enhanced the discussion and people can say he had good intents. On paper you can still say it is vote manipualtion, but considering this context I dont really see a reason to act upon, even though it would be definitely justified."

The current rules are so immoral they should be illegal with how they stop players from understanding their value.  But Riot loves that.  It keeps the costs down for their teams so Riot doesn't have to pay the teams as much.
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Xaxxon,6,Mon Jun 29 08:10:00 2015 UTC,"Someday people will open their eyes and realize that Riot really just DOES NOT GIVE A SHIT about their players  Repeatedly, over and over again, they have favored orgs over players, and when you compare older judgement about CLG poaching and shite against this the ruling just looks straight up Draconian.  There's only one possible reason for their rulings being so draconian and thats because they perceive Badawi, and like Monte too as he's positioned himself quite well against Riot in the past, to be an outright THREAT.   The fact of the matter is players are getting fucked, and Riot likes it that way."
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Shaella_,2,Mon Jun 29 09:27:10 2015 UTC,Monte was such a big threat they put him on the payroll!

RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Shaella_,2,Tue Jun 30 02:39:24 2015 UTC,And Riot pays OGN. How do you think they survived dropping their subscription model and suddenly becoming free?
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Palin4PresidentLoL,-1,Tue Jun 30 02:41:05 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of whats going on, but he doesn't directly work for Riot, so they can't really issue anything like a competitive ruling on him, he operates independently from the company. He is not in fact paid by Riot, he is paid by OGN. I mean sure you can say if you look up the food chain but when you get to that level you'll rapidly realize thats a stupid line of reasoning.  If and when Riot fully takes over the LCK broadcast, i wouldn't be surprised if Monte is no longer there."
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Shaella_,2,Tue Jun 30 02:45:25 2015 UTC,"Yep.  So many people drink the cool aid, but Riot is in it for Riot - no one else.  Their power trip is almost awe inspiring, but I've seen it before with the UFC.  It's almost a perfect mirror image."
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Xaxxon,0,Mon Jun 29 09:39:56 2015 UTC,"Riot only really cares about one thing: themselves and their vision.  Siding with the organizations gets them money and propels e-sports further when they have big names in their leagues.    Players are expendable and are just used to build drama.  And yes it's pretty clear that Riot did this ruling because they saw Badawi as a threat.  Much like they used a catch-all ruling on Reginald a year ago with the Lustboy case because Nick Allen and his precious screening process looked like a joke when Lustboy was announced to be on the starting roster before all the paperwork was fully completed.  And the CLG Korea scrims debacle was pretty much Riot punishing CLG for treating the LCS as it was - a joke.  It would be nice if someone higher up could hold Riot accountable for all this bullshit, but sadly that will never happen unless e-sports starts getting player unions or (please no) government regulation."

RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,matthitsthetrails,-2,Wed Jul 1 08:15:26 2015 UTC,Gee I wonder why this isn't on the front page of /r/LoL.  Glorious Moderators wanting to keep things quiet again?
RiotFreeLoL,3bh7cv,Sorenthaz,5,Mon Jun 29 15:50:03 2015 UTC,It is on the front page you twat.

RiotFreeLoL,3bg1x6,Zimzams123,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:21:02 2015 UTC,Also you need to level to unlock abilities in Hots.   Put me off the game entirely when i saw that
RiotFreeLoL,3bg1x6,Zimzams123,4,Sun Jun 28 23:00:36 2015 UTC,in LoL u also have to unlock sumeners and masteries by lvling
RiotFreeLoL,3bg1x6,ekjohnson9,5,Sun Jun 28 23:07:21 2015 UTC,"No as in champion abilities. So in Hots i could play a champ (or whatever they are called in Hots) at lv 1 and decide i don't like him. But actually could be an alternate ability for his ulti that completely changes how you play that champ that i never knew about, that actually makes the champ way more fun or interesting.  I guess thats the problem in Lol (with the exception of smite) none of the summoners that are gated on lvs fundamentally change the way champions are played. Sure midlaners may find it harder to solokill their enemy in lane without flash/ignite - but even without those a LB or Zed is always going to be an assassin etc. In Hots because you dont have items, your role is defined by what skills you choose - so gating those abilities with levels makes the game needlessly restricted to new players and makes it even harder than normal to find a champ you like."
RiotFreeLoL,3bg1x6,MashCojones,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:20:42 2015 UTC,It's like 2 games to get all the abilities.  Perfectly reasonable IMO.

RiotFreeLoL,3bazrr,Zeju,2,Sat Jun 27 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"One solution could be to split each LCS in half. Odd placings in one group and even placing numbers in the other.  This would allow teams to freely scrim teams from the other group as they don't have to play each other on stage.  Another solution would be to combine EU- and NALCS air time. Have EU play bo2 3 sets then NA play 3 sets over a 3day period. Or 2 bo2 sets each region over 4 days.  This would result in more view time for Riot, more local tickets sold to their events, and better preparation for the playing teams. But each week six teams from each region must play twice."
RiotFreeLoL,3bazrr,ariolander,2,Sat Jun 27 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"One proposed solution I saw was moving to a China-like Bo2 format. Same number of games in a split, same schedule but have Bo2s with half the teams one day, other half the other day."

RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,matthitsthetrails,3,Sat Jun 27 14:58:28 2015 UTC,Well Monte said he is looking to slowly transition out of casting into other things including his ownership of Renegades so unless Riot goes after that he might not care about casting worlds.

For the most part, the both of them agreed that it was an important precedent to set as we continue to expand the LCS scene.  The only thing Chris did was subtly (by League and Reddit standards anyway) imply that Riot botched the investigation by acting on information they clearly did not have. This was the ""warning"" email chain and Keith Skype chat-log. Even the Quas situation appears to have been word of mouth, without any concrete evidence.  Personally I think this heavily implies that Liquid112 leaned on Riot. He appears to have the most vested interest in the harshness and clear misinformation of Riot's recent competitive ruling."

RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,himynameisfil,4,Sat Jun 27 09:59:10 2015 UTC,Let me remind you that Liquid banned people for talking about LoL on their forum.
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,Shaella_,2,Sat Jun 27 14:20:24 2015 UTC,when was this
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,himynameisfil,3,Sat Jun 27 21:53:08 2015 UTC,When Team Liquid was primarily a StarCraft forum. I wasn't on the forums that much so I'm I cannot verify if talking about LoL was ban worthy but the forum as a whole was very against LoL as a competitive game because it was too casual friendly. They would have sub-forums for different games and did not allow LoL as one of them.   It was fairly ironic that they did this considering they were head over heals in love with HearthStone which was also designed to be a casual friendly game.
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,Shaella_,2,Sun Jun 28 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Really, because I -was- on TL when it was primarily a SC forum  There were parts of the community that were against LoL, so what, there was also a subforum for LoL.  I'm gonna state that again, that LoL had its own subforum.   So you're talking out your ass, and your implication that they BANNED PEOPLE FOR TALKING ABOUT LOL is a straight LIE, the only real stick LoL fan's beat TL with is that when they picked Dota the owners picked it because they liked the game better and League players have been butthurt about it ever since  Get over it, and stop fucking lying about them banning people for talking about it."
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,himynameisfil,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:07:40 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I explicitly stated my qualifications on confirming/denying TL banning a certain set of people so I'm unsure where you get this idea that I've implied that or implicated that. I guess you had this retort in mind to anyone that answered your question.  So the TL forum had specific subforums like General SC2, tournaments, strategy, etc. If memory serves me well, Dota got their own subforum category whereas LoL discussions had to occur in a specific LoL post under the Other Games subforum even though Dota2 and LoL were getting similar viewer numbers(which would have certain implications on how the people running the show views/compares the games). Did they change their forum structure so that LoL had it's own subforum during the SC2 days?"
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,himynameisfil,2,Sun Jun 28 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"yes.'  you're lying about them banning people for talking about LoL too, so you're just an ass."
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,DidYuhim,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:06:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why you're being so hostile towards me. Did I say something to offend you personally?   I never made that claim that TL banned people for talking about LoL. If I stopped after the first sentence of giving a time frame, then yea I could see how that implies TL did ban people for talking about LoL. Although I figured that anyone that read the sentence after that (with a decent level of reading comprehension) would understand that I am not qualified to speak about the truthfulness of /u didYuhim's claim. This would imply that the time frame I'm giving is the only timeframe that would make sense based on what I know. I probed you to determine if my recollection was incorrect only to find out that it's not incorrect, it's out of date.   You also have to consider that I thought I was responding to someone asking for information, not someone that was intentionally looking for an internet argument.  So yea, if that makes me a lying ass, then so be it. Although I would like you to compare the general level of hostility that I have been to you vs the level of hostility that you have been to me. If I'm a complete ass, how would you rank yourself relative to me?"
RiotFreeLoL,3bafr4,himynameisfil,3,Sun Jun 28 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you can't put that stupid crap that Team Liquid did on Steve's hands. He didn't become an owner until TL acquired Curse. Since then, their forums became LoL friendly(on a management level)"

As for teaching people the game, your ability to think about, talk about and even demonstrate some stratagems is only loosely related to your rank in my opinion. It is thoughtless to suggest that just because someone is low rank (or even just sorta low) that they can't teach or talk about the game at high level is just close minded."
RiotFreeLoL,3b9o8r,crushedbycookie,-4,Sat Jun 27 15:58:20 2015 UTC,"A low rank player teaching league is completely worthless. I've played in all divisions and the only place where people know how to play right is the higher ones.  I could teach someone some retarded cheese for in bronze or silver, but it wouldn't work on the higher ranks anymore.  The only correct techniques to gain elo constantly are techniques that actually work against higher elo players"
RiotFreeLoL,3b9o8r,ubern00by,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:11:06 2015 UTC,I completely disagree. For one a new player could be taught the basics by even a low tier bronze player for at least a little while. Furthermore being able to think at a diamond or challenger level is not the same as being able to play at that level. You can lack the mechanical skill to play at that level without lacking the ability to talk about the game even in the professional environment (take Montecristo who was only ever in gold and no longer plays the game for example).
RiotFreeLoL,3b9o8r,crushedbycookie,-2,Sat Jun 27 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"There are certain limitations to the amount of skill you can have in game. This is mostly limited by hardware such as the PC or the internet connection (ping)  League is generally not that mechanically intense of a game, it's mostly reliant on decision making and knowledge of skills and damage etc. Games like Osu or Counterstrike in which you frantically have to move your mouse arround accurately are mechanically intensive, but in league of legends most characters don't have that many skillshots to aim.  A gold player teaching a bronze player just means that once the bronze player reaches gold he has to be taught all over again."
RiotFreeLoL,3b9o8r,ubern00by,0,Sat Jun 27 19:58:04 2015 UTC,Then how is Montecristo a top level analyst. You're just wrong if you think this game isn't mechanically intensive.

More importantly, please respond to my primary point, which is if you can't think about this game at a high level without playing the game at a high level how is Monte a top level analyst? Furthermore, what about a hypothetical person who played at a very high level then lost his right hand? Can he think about the game at a high level even though he can't play anymore? For how long?

You don't need to move your mouse quickly, just be sure not to flash into a wall (cough Nien cough)  -Requirements to win lower elo games are completely retarded.     Someone who knows the correct meta to play and counterplay can give advice, however this requires the person to have played in a high division recently. Meta's can change and playing at a lower elo very much clouds judgement of what is a good play and what is not, since almost anything goes over there.  Even worse, often a shitty tactic like splitpushing top with Tryndamere all day is more efficient than a good one in lower elo's because they have no idea how to just group mid and take your entire base.    Ciderhelm looks like a terrible analyst (as most are). I just watched his channel promoted video and he has no idea what he's talking about.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93YMYIXiOIw&feature=youtu.be&t=3m32s   Fanatic should have just instantly engaged the Baron fight instead of trying to stall it, There is no such thing as a three way fork in this situation. Fanatic has a MASSIVE Aoe comp, with a Rumble ultimate, a Leona ultimate a Jarvan ultimate and a Varus ultimate, while all that Royal has is a Single target Caitlin, a single target elise, an Annie who has already blown Tibbers and a Kayle who can actually hit multiple targets.  Kayle's ultimate is rendered worthless since in this situation she will ALWAYS have to use it on herself if a teamfight is executed correctly.  -Soaz Rumble ultimate was SHIT. This actually the reason they lost, not because some strategical overanalytical bullshit Ciderhelm pulls out of his ass.  what he did  what he should have done  -Yellowstar should have engaged first  -J4 could have perfectly dunked that group  -Varus ult would hold them together  I would go as far as to say they could have easily won that teamfight 4v5 with the Shen coming in.

I used to play the game, I got pissed at Riot as I spent money on it and they never seemed to give any meaningful content in return ""Its a free game, duhh, don't expect anything"" as if Riot is a non-profit organization.  I don't like Riot, I think they are one of the shadiest gaming companies I know of (maybe because they suck hard at damage control and struggle with leaks), and still they have the illusion of being the ""company that listens to their community!!!!"", its such a fucking joke.  I really want their company to die tbh, but it won't happen when most of the community is absolutely gutless, and will just keep complaining and never actually do anything that can ""hurt"" the game/Riot, similar to what the WoW subs did in WoD."

The LoL engine was probably written by 4 guys in a basement and then added on to repeatedly over time to handle the siege of popularity.   I personally believe Riot could focus better but they did have a crappy start and compared to Valve. Steam was hated for a long time but had the resources to work their way out of it in a few years. Riot has the same opportunity.

And its just a counter-argument to all the people which always shows up in the technical/qol threads who claim that it was never intended to have it in their infrastructure.  So basically, the replay system is 6years late, not 3 (or whenever it was added on the test servers). So basically, just another argument vs the ""its too late to integrate it into the spaghetti code"" arguments."
RiotFreeLoL,3b7n90,CrsIaanix,2,Fri Jun 26 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"The replay system is essentially in the client since spectator mode exists. All you have to do is dump the already generated data (from the spectator mode) into a file, which is exactly the same for every player in any given game, associate said file with all 10 accounts who were in that game, create a UI to download them - and done. Whats missing is binary backwards compatibility, old replays have to work on newer versions of the game (thats still missing on PBE afaik). Plenty of FOSS solutions to deal with exactly this problem available. Iirc Dota2 uses a lib created by some google team during a Summer of Code to accomplish that, while things like this are not exactly plug and play they are far from technical innovations and a multi billion dollar company should be able to get them done in a few weeks, wouldn't be ready and done for the customer at that point ofc.  The server costs are largely storage space and bandwidth, both are relatively cheap resources. Especially considering that the data transferred is non critical, could be streamed and throttled all you like - we are talking about 5-10 MB per replay (packed). They could even outsource the replay-data since they are completely non confidential and can be hosted on amazons cloud service for all we care.  The problem on reddit is that most people here don't have a clue about how a company on the scale of Riot should work and don't have the slightest grasp on how the technical side of things work either, which unfortunately seems to includes you.

I wish teams would collaborate and consider pulling out of LCS unless a rule revision thats more accommodating to the players is made.

RiotFreeLoL,3b6j73,Provokyo,7,Fri Jun 26 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"I think the knee jerk hate to this video is exactly the kind of thing he was talking about. The takeaway isn't that Riot is OK just because Blizzard also makes mistakes. The takeaway is that Riot isn't particlarly bad or evil. And because Riot's problems are so pedestrian, our outsize outrage at their perceived inefficiency is hyperbolic and unnecessary.    Remember the reaction when Chroma packs came out? Dear Lord, it was like someone had planted a bomb inside a bag full of kittens. How about a reaction that is reasonable, instead of the usual cacophony of harpy-babble?    He then goes on to say what he thinks is his biggest gripe about Riot (transparency), and does so in a way that is simple, calm and reasonable. Perhaps you disagree that this is something Riot does poorly. Perhaps you don't like the way they are attempting to market eSports, like that other guy elsewhere in this thread. Fine. You can have that opinion.    But to say he's justifying Riot's laziness is a bit of a stretch. Riot's problems are run-of-the-mill problems. Stop rushing to be shocked, shocked, at each issue when they pop up."
RiotFreeLoL,3b6j73,tazza2,6,Fri Jun 26 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Remember the reaction when Chroma packs came out? Dear Lord, it was like someone had planted a bomb inside a bag full of kittens. How about a reaction that is reasonable, instead of the usual cacophony of harpy-babble?   There was a lot of hate for chroma's and there was also a lot of reasonable discussion as to why Riot was charging so much for low effort content, as well as why the wanted to produce low effort content. Not all of it was unreasonable hatred. I still think Chroma's are a rip-off and a sign that Riot is digging for money, by producing low quality content. And their focus on skins over the last year or so, shows that they would rather divulge resources to skins, than other area's of their company.  As for transparency, I don't get why this is AS big of a problem as he says it is. Riot tells us a lot of the time, what they are doing, what their goals are and what direction they are headed. They used to be way more transparent, yes. But I don't think they should be as clear as they used to be, considering the blunder of AoShin and magma chamber, among other things.  I don't necessarily think Riot is lazy, but I do think they neglect certain area's and their development over-all is incredibly slow. Problems from 4 years ago still exist in this game, and I don't know why people jump to defend Riot when this shit is borderline unacceptable. I've been playing this game shortly after beta, and my opinion gets more and more soured every patch by Riot, because they keep producing content that I don't care about, or content that isn't related to their game. They constantly invest in e-Sports and neglect the game."
RiotFreeLoL,3b6j73,reskk,0,Fri Jun 26 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"I've rewritten this response three times now. Anyway, your points are well taken. I think in the end transparency vs priorities is an issue of intentions vs results. Us transparency folks care about intention. I think Riot doesn't go out of its way to neglect the game. I think there are good reasons as to why Magma Chamber was shelved, Ao Shin is stalled, and the replay system isn't out yet. I just want to know what those reasons are. For folks who care about priorities, it doesn't matter why Magma Chamber was shelved, it's just an issue of Riot getting the content out.    I get what you're saying when you say they aren't producing stuff you care about/related to the game. I think perhaps I'm easier to please on that front. I think their moves on champs, skins and custom game modes counts."

RiotFreeLoL,3b6j73,Phobiya,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"well just look at the replay desire they dont tell anything about it creating the feeling like they have abandoned the idea   That is not the large driving factor behind the outrage over replays. Riot did this to themselves when they promised replays all the way back in beta. Just like many other things they wanted to be transparent on, but just should have not said anything. So yes after how many years now when players can compare similar games and go wait they had these features on launch. When you promise something to your customers then don't deliver then do it again and again. It might be time to one get your shit together and start delivering on promises or two ease up on the transparency, and start not promising things way far in advance before you know they will actually come to pass."
RiotFreeLoL,3b6j73,DidYuhim,-1,Thu Jul 2 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I think thats their problem. They can't let people think that they aren't working on it, and yet they are too slow at implementing it.  I think adding it to their test realms was a huge mistake, concidering it was no where near ready for the live servers.  I don't play LoL anymore, I allready gave up on Riot a few years ago due to their lack of productivity and other things. But as for DotA, we don't really have regular ""transparancy"" updates, we sometimes gets hidden clues but most of the time, we have absolutely no idea when the updates are coming, so there is not really any false hype or disappointment.  We just wait and then suddenly out of the blue, a huge update which I think creates a lot better immersion rather than having ""they said replay systems are coming soon"" 2 years after the statement was made.  If the PR department fucks around and creates hype when the devs aren't ready for it, it creates a bad atmosphere and just makes the entire company seem disfunctional."

(The lack of good FA period or not being allowed to stream other games in their contract) They only bring up having a more structured free agency period after this public outcry.

They had a vision for the team and are getting a lot of abuse for it, even tho they are trying to improve.  So many people nowadays want the west to be successful internationally, but when CW makes moves to improve their team in the long term they get hate for ""not being nice"". They pay Freeze more highly than other players because he is their best player by far and they cant afford to lose him.   You can see how important I believe him [Freeze] to be to the line-up because I say that if we lose him we are playing for auto-relegations   Airwaks, Unlimited and YoungBuck are not among the strongest in Europe and for a team with such high ambitions, replacements like Shook give CW at least a chance of improving in the standings. Sticking with the ""nice guys"" is a good way to get yourself relegated. They are all expendable and easily replaced.

Then people would be angry that no one is honest with the players so they didn't get a chance to ""find a better spot"" or they are not valued enough.

Riot was right in their punishment. Freeze gets paid more. The rest of the team is bitching because they want the same amount of money. They were in talks with azubu and wanted to give freeze the cut the organization normally would get. Thats about it. At least in my opinion nothing of this is actually newsworthy. I obviuosly dont know Richards opinion there. Maybe he sees it differently and would have published an article because he would think its in the public interest.

I am pretty sure that those kind of things are very common and pretty much every Org does what people perceive as douchy. I'm sad that they didn't get away with this as I would love to see more competitive teams in EU LCS; currently as I see it there are only 2 or 3 of those, the rest is just bad at the moment."

CLG TSM TL H2K OG Fnatic EDG QG KOO SKT  Regardless of talent of the region, the most successful teams have supports with higher proportional gold indicating there ability to influence the game."
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Firmamentum,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"This would be a fine thing in theory. But what happens if CLG, yet again, crumbles around playoffs? Putting untested (on the big stage) players into crucial games is not a smart move, and threatening the poor performers with benching at that point would be pointless.  This is why I think they should at least give Huhi and Stixxay some real experience, if they are considered a serious alternative to Pobelter and Doublelift. That way, if the worst happens again, they won't have to go in completely cold. I mean, it's not like we haven't seen amazing performances from CLG in the early season before."
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Haxenkk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:57:10 2015 UTC,I doubt they would put in the subs during playoffs but rather in the next split. I assume the players know: fuck up in playoffs --> not on the starting roster for the next split and maybe never again
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,TaiTay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:29:02 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having sub contracts on key players position to show if you don't want your job we are gonna replace you even if it hurts us in the short term. This mostly applies to top teams ofc as they want to stay on top and motivating players to move to a worse team or step up is a good way to do it.
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Nordic_Marksman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:59:44 2015 UTC,"While I think the conclusion that having an expanded roster that one doesn't use in competitive play leads to better results is sound, I disagree with the author's reasoning behind it. He primarily attributes this to fear.    If fear alone were the motivating factor, the owner of the team would not need to actually sign alternate players. The owner would only need to loudly threaten to do so in the gaming house. Obviously, actually signing an alternate provides a larger amount of this fear, or makes that fear somewhat more real, but that's a difference in degree and not in kind.    Instead, the improved results likely come from the fact that expanded rosters allow your A-string to scrim against your B-string, and allows your team to practice things they wouldn't normally get to practice in scrims against competitor teams. One of the great strengths of Korea in general, and not just SKT Telecom in particular, was the fact that they had sister teams that they would scrim against. Obviously, it helped that Samsung White's scrim partner, Samsung Blue, just happened to be the number 2 team in the world at the time. But I think the greater factor was the fact that the managers were able to better control and dictate test conditions.    When CLG hired their new coach, he mentioned bringing a college football coaching mentality to League. I'm sure this A-string vs B-string practice is a part of that, and the real reason CLG has been improving."
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Provokyo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:23:44 2015 UTC,Well you cant scrim against a b-team if you only have two substitutes. Also trying to go the skt style would be plain stupid just considering the format of the lcs
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,TaiTay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. I think that's more of a possible future goal. Perhaps it's unlikely. But I think there are similar benefits to be had even without the full second string. Having someone else in that role in scrims or in discussions provides another point of view as to how that role can be played, and played successfully. It opens up potential avenues of strategy that an ADC like Doublelift might have trouble seeing, because he might very confidently believe in only one strategy and thus have blinders on.    What do you think are the specific characteristics of the format differences between LCK and LCS that make the SKT style successful in Korea, but would make it stupid in LCS?"
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Provokyo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:28:56 2015 UTC,The bo1 vs bo3. In Korea you can in the first game with a specific strategy with a set of players. When the enemy team has your strategy figured out after the first or second game you can switch up some players which completly changes the dynamic of the team and gives you that extra edge. In the lcs you don't have that at all except for playoffs. The teams also have to tell lcs officials which roster they use in the games. So when a team is in a situation where one player has a bad first game they cant switch him out for the second game the next day if they already put him on the roster for that game. I also have to note that even skt isn't really using this strategy anymore just because faker just destroys everyone in his way right now so there is nearly no reason to play easyhoon. Why they are not playing tom more often i cant tell though.
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,TaiTay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:55:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, if the bo1 vs bo3 format is the only difference, then I think having subs and using that strategy still works in both systems. Whereas in a bo3, the key strength is a team's adaptation and a sub can hinder that adaptation, in a bo1, the key strength lies in a team's execution. And a team's execution depends on their preparation. Having subs can hinder that preparation, by creating a different potential roster combination that a team must prepare against.    Of course, that's all hypothetical, since to make it work you would need subs that are of equal skill level but with different champion pools or play styles, and you would need other teams to think that you might actually use your subs. If LCS teams tried to use a Faker/Easyhoon strategy (where Faker is a god and Easyhoon is basically a lesser version of him), it wouldn't work as well.    So in the end, I don't think it's stupid if they used subs the way SKT does. Though it wouldn't be optimal for CLG to recruit just lesser versions of Doublelift and Pobelter."
RiotFreeLoL,3b35xa,Provokyo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:07:33 2015 UTC,Well like i said the problem in the lcs is that teams have to tell which roster they are using days before the actual game. Can't throw the enemy team off if they know whats coming.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,SheepishEmpire,23,Thu Jun 25 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"so lets get this right, succeeding in poaching a player and coach and lying about it 10k+5k fine. Threatening a player to take his mom's house away and effectively holding him hostage 5k fine of which the player was fined by the org itself because of the situation.  A challenger team trying to poach a sub player to what degree we have no idea loss of ownership and being forced to sell."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,kavinh10,4,Thu Jun 25 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like Chris just pissed off the wrong people, specifically TLs owner who has been in the scene a very long time and owns one of the biggest companies in esports and especially LoL. Riot is essentially the big bad boss that plays favorites and when you mess with one of their favorites you get made an example of. Not to say he may not deserve punishment but I agree anyone would look at this and agree this is extremely unsettling and excessive."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,droppinb0mbs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:21:03 2015 UTC,Riot's doing this the wrong way though.  You don't punish the little guy more than the big guys because it makes you look bad.  The Phil Jacksons and Kobe's get fined much more in the NBA because they know better.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,moush,2,Fri Jun 26 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"ya but the little guy in this case has no fanbase and his team brand isn't worth anything to lcs yet. Clg on the otherhand's brand is so crucial to lcs storylines and hotshot has a massive fanbase, so in riot's world what they're doing is fine provided their PR manages to paint the little guy in such a despicable way no one sides with him."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,kavinh10,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:48:16 2015 UTC,"i think it's alot more sinister then that, TDK/misfits/regenade have no value to riot on a publicity level, they aren't established and the brand is completely new. CLG on the other hand is an established brand and hotshot's a well loved member of the community so they're giving leeway to clg just cause they have value to the lcs brand."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,kavinh10,-1,Fri Jun 26 23:45:12 2015 UTC,Well played
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,gahyoujerk,-1,Thu Jun 25 19:34:18 2015 UTC,Well Met!
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Xinta3,8,Fri Jun 26 11:04:42 2015 UTC,"Personally think the leaked skype logs around copenhagen wolves show riot in a worse light with the way they were strongarming i think dentist? maybe the cw owner and the continual accusation of lieing and having evidence.  The more interesting thing for me, mostly because i have no idea if stuff is in place. But footballers had agents that are the first point of call when you want to consider buying them out from there current club.   You give them a call and see if their client is at least interested in a move. Now im pretty sure league players for the most part wont have an agent that covers contract talks for them. So if you cant talk to an agent that doesnt exist and talking directly to a player is considered tampering, the only option is to go directly to the team.  But if the team straight declines talks, are they not obligated to inform the player that movements were made in regards to their services?"
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Tortillagirl,5,Thu Jun 25 11:43:38 2015 UTC,Having agents for players leads to a union which RIOT would hate.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,quesadillakid,8,Thu Jun 25 13:01:01 2015 UTC,Agents have nothing to do with unions. An agent is someone who specifically watches out for the players interest someone who essentially works just for that player. They do shit for which the players are either not qualified or which they don't give a shit about... or mostly both. But having a lawyer or an agent is not the first step towards a union. Actually if all players had both there would likely be less need for a union since those parties get payed to look after the players interest specifically and assuming they are doing a good job contracts wouldn't be as bad as they seem to be right now. For Riot both things go into the same general direction but one doesn't necessarily lead to the other.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,2defixx,2,Thu Jun 25 13:19:05 2015 UTC,"having personal representation doesn't necessarily lead to unions, think it helps players only have to concentrate on the game itself in similar ways to having in house chefs, maids etc to cook and clean so they have less things they need to do tha arnt directly related to game performance."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Tortillagirl,2,Thu Jun 25 13:43:40 2015 UTC,"Lawyers and Agents are expensive creatures to keep on retainer. It's highly unlikely that players will actually be able to afford these services as individuals. This goes for players across all e-sports, not just League of Legends.  It's probable that an e-sports pro-player union would get involved before the players ever reach the earning capacity to afford the services of a lawyer or an agent.  How many years in the future and through what title, nobody knows..."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,cannyOCE,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Nah it would just make things more fair for the players, which Riot would still hate unless they controlled those agents.  And there already is a pseudo-union between some of the NA LCS teams.  At least from what I've heard, the managers of C9, TSM, and Liquid meet with each other weekly to discuss stuff.  And CLG might be a part of that too.   That's how TSM was able to get Keith for scrims."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sorenthaz,0,Thu Jun 25 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"But that's the problem, there is rumours that ALOT of contracts does not include this. Now, the esportslawyer guy is saying that he includes a clause in every contract he helps negotiate that forces a team to inform a player if another team has apporached him, but currently there is alot of players that does not have such a clause.   That essentially means a team can never tell a player if another X team apporached him"
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sikletrynet,2,Fri Jun 26 07:56:58 2015 UTC,"If a league has a no tampering rule, whether or not theres a clause in a contract. They should be morally obligated to inform players whether approaches were made or not."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Tortillagirl,0,Fri Jun 26 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing, the norm is that a team WON'T tell the player he was approached, especially if they want to keep him"
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sikletrynet,11,Fri Jun 26 09:32:10 2015 UTC,Didn't know all of the back-story  behind the Chris Badawi ruling.  It's really painful to watch shit like this happen. Riot fucked someone over just to show that they can.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,cannyOCE,4,Thu Jun 25 06:17:29 2015 UTC,"I have no idea anymore who said it, but was a long time ago:   You do not fuck with Riot.   Since Riot has full control about anything League related they are in a position where they can do as they please. And this can lead to a lot of people bending over for Riot, because they have too."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,SomePoros,2,Thu Jun 25 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably for the best that you forgot who said that, just look at that one dude that said ""My observation in the scene is this: Players. Get. Fucked."" :p  hint: Chris Badawi said that."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,himynameisfil,2,Fri Jun 26 00:23:23 2015 UTC,Yep.  Riot is only interested in Riot at the end of the day.  Badawi at least had the balls to speak his mind about how players get fucked over by the current system.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sorenthaz,0,Thu Jun 25 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"He tried to hide what he did. He even told Keith that if they asked they never had that conversation. Don't misrepresent the facts, thats a Riot thing ;)"
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Markssa,0,Thu Jun 25 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Or as RL put it, it could be seen more as a ""I fucked up and didn't know how to come to you about this stuff properly, let's forget this happened and redo it on the proper channels""."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sorenthaz,3,Thu Jun 25 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"But if that's the case, why did he not contact Steve again about a possible move?  I thought he never contacted Team Liquid again after he got told not to talk to players behind the team managements backs."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Markssa,0,Thu Jun 25 20:21:56 2015 UTC,Not sure about the timeline but could the TSM tryout effected his ability to approach management?
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Volkerman,2,Thu Jun 25 22:34:46 2015 UTC,I think this investigation has been going for way longer than that. probably a few weeks since he did the poaching attempts.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Markssa,0,Thu Jun 25 23:02:42 2015 UTC,Monte's statement cleared up a lot. I think Riot's statement kind of made it seem a lot more malicious than what I think it was.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Volkerman,0,Fri Jun 26 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"Read the ruling first and it really out Chris in a bad light. At first I thought Richard was reaching to pull it together then we he mentioned the actual conversations that took place, I was blown away that this was Riot's response."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Volkerman,4,Thu Jun 25 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty insane that Riot are basically saying ""we're going to force you to sell a company that you partly own"", I find it more insane that people didn't realise that, more interesting in spamming the thread on /r/lol with memes..."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,xNicolex,-2,Thu Jun 25 12:45:09 2015 UTC,They're only forcing him to sell if he wants to be a part of LCS because they're basically saying he's banned from LCS.
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,moush,2,Fri Jun 26 22:08:33 2015 UTC,Right...except what exactly is a LoL team for then?
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,xNicolex,3,Sat Jun 27 07:05:09 2015 UTC,"honestly this video is a waste of time. Instead of focussing on the real problems that this ruling has (discrepancy between LCS/CS, lenght of ban, possible ineffectiveness of the ruling) he only points out that this was entirely made because chris openly criticized riot and riot wants to have control over everything.  Whilst I agree that riot is very over-controlling things, which is bad and good at the same time, this is definitely not about that.  So anyone that wanted some additional insight on the matter shouldnt bother to watch this. If you want some facts with blown up anti-riot-hypotheticals with very big questions marks, then it's worth your time."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,MashCojones,2,Thu Jun 25 09:50:13 2015 UTC,"Clearly you haven't watched the rest of RL's stuff. He leads the crusade against Riot and his opinion is always given in the context to all he knows about that. Its a good video in this context, not an unbiased logical conclusion which I'm guessing is more your style. Have you tried Thorin's stuff? Though he hasn't released anything on this topic yet, he tends to analyse things logically without much pitchforking. I believe both views are important in the scene. RL is just on this side of things, which in my opinion really pokes holes into Riot's PR FAQ they've put up. Interesting regardless, and not a waste of time."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,poookie13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:21:51 2015 UTC,"I know his work, and I know that his editorials more often than not include his very biased opinion.  And that's what i call out. In this one the amount of bias and blind accusations just exceeds any sane common sense, which makes the video look like a presentation of paranoid conspiracy theories.  I dont see how this can be an important view on stuff in any form. Seriously it's only some void accusations without any evidence other than ""riot is full of bad guys anyway"".  If you are a fan of conspiracy theories then sure its not a waste of time. If you like facts and are not massively biased negatively towards to riot, then this video is just crap."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,MashCojones,-3,Fri Jun 26 12:29:28 2015 UTC,"It was his reaction to the Chris Badawi ruling. Thats what the video is titled. riot made a rule specifically to make sure that people they didnt want can't enter the LCS. He mentions the length of the ban is similar to Deficio's, which is ridiculous. And the ineffectiveness of the ban is discussed when he questions how Badawi can be involved in the organization.  Essentially, your calling out the quality of the subjects discussed which is ridiculous because he covered everything you mentioned, while providing backstory as to why the ruling was so harsh. Including what happened around Keith and Quas.   I dont know what else you want."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,d3ciever,7,Thu Jun 25 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"I dont know what else you want.    logical conclusions. Be objective and you would never come to his conclusions considering the facts.  And no he doesnt cover the discrepancy of LCS/CS, and he also doesnt cover that chris can still be active in the team. He even says that riot forced him out of e-sports until the ban ends, which is just a stupid exaggeration.  There is a lot of bias in this video. It's a pity considering that it is a rather interesting topic, and has enough controversials without being paranoid."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,MashCojones,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yes he does cover how He can still be involved in the team. I can't search the video now because I'm at work, but near the end of the video he talks about how Chris could be maybe a vice-president. How much he could talk to the players, and if he talks to the players about the game, does that constitute coaching, which would violate his restrictions."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,d3ciever,2,Thu Jun 25 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"See that's the point. He doesn't say ""the ruling is actually not that bad as badawi can still make the same work, just not officially recognized by riot"". He goes on and extends his paranoid view to raise problems that obviously will never happen. Why would it be against the restrictions when he coaches players? He just cant be the official main-coach, but Riot has no say in who or who not you employ in your organisation.  Something Rlewis clearly knows, atleast if he has done any research on the matter, which I think he did and does. So instead of focussing on the real ineffectiveness, he brings up such a bullshit that obviously isn't problematic at all."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,MashCojones,2,Fri Jun 26 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"Alright I agree with you there. He shouldnt try to bring up speculative problems, because as a journalist, he should focus on facts.  But what i was arguing is that you said he didn't address it, which he did, albeit briefly."
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,d3ciever,-1,Fri Jun 26 13:38:04 2015 UTC,"How about the fact that Riot created the a new rule specifically for Badawi to violate after he had attempted to poach? The fact that Misfits/Renegades was not even within either Challenger League or LCS when these events took place, and therefore not under any contractual obligations against poaching? The fact that LCS teams are  freely allowed to poach from Challenger teams but vice versa is not allowed?"
RiotFreeLoL,3b0xo3,Sedreftheri,2,Thu Jun 25 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"How about the fact that Riot created the a new rule specifically for Badawi to violate after he had attempted to poach?    bullshit poaching rule was in place before that and was also applied before that. saying badawi had anything to do with it is delusional.   The fact that Misfits/Renegades was not even within either Challenger League or LCS when these events took place, and therefore not under any contractual obligations against poaching?   exactly that is also a critical point which he doesnt check in-depth because he focusses on stupid stuff. However I understand riot's take on this. Alike a player can not get permission to participate in the LCS for being toxic in the game before signing any contract, you can apply the same for the owner and their misbehaviour.   The fact that LCS teams are freely allowed to poach from Challenger teams but vice versa is not allowed?   thats what i mean by discrepancy of LCS/CS, which rlewis also doesnt cover proberly.

The new rule was vaguely worded to specifically apply to this situation by saying if a person acts against ""the spirit of the rules"" that they will be denied entry into the LCS.  If you read the ruling they made, they applied this update that was added in their ruling, so it was almost assuredly added to work against Badawi.

As I said: It doesnt matter if you a contractual to the LCS or CS. Riot has made very clear that they check your previous behaviour before they employ you. That includes stuff you have done BEFORE signing anything.

Sure there was poaching, but there wasnt someone who did it multiple times despite getting a warning and in-depth explanation of why it is bad.  The punishment is way too long and is obviously there to make a point, as riot said themselves.

Earlier this month, Team Liquid accused Misfits, a team that hasn’t even yet qualified for the Challenger Series, with tampering, illegally contacting Liquid top laner Diego “Quas” Ruiz. But that’s a double standard: as the rules currently stand, Team Liquid has free reign to poach players from Challenger Series teams who don’t have the same protection. In fact, Liquid's signing of Ruiz  in October 2013 could be considered as such; one of Ruiz’s former teammates, Aaron “Bischu” Kim, certainly considered it poaching."""
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Micolino,6,Thu Jun 25 03:12:27 2015 UTC,"Uhm, didn't Liquid actually talk with the owner of GGLA back then? Obviously, the team owner's statement should always be taken with a grain of salt, but I thought Quas simply got bought out of his contract. There was a discussion on the other sub at the time Richard published the article about Misfits allegedly poaching Quas, and from what I've gathered, Curse's acquisition of Quas was completely legit.  Also, I don't know why everybody sees Bischu's tweet as proof that Quas was poached. Maybe Bischu, even though he played with Quas on the team back then, simply thinks acquiring Quas before a big tournament is poaching? He could maybe mix up the term as well..."

RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Chairmeow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:16:49 2015 UTC,"ridiculous ruling.  Rito must think they are like Sauron's all-seeing eye from LOTR.  no other game concerns theirself with punishing players and owners as much as Rito.  just seems they just preach a message of sin (toxic behavior) and hell (bans and fines) along with atonement and redemption through enlightenment of their ""toxic"" ways.  many commentators have openly criticized Rito for their overly strict anti-poaching rule already.  A reason so many teams continue to do it is because the rule is too strict."
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,gahyoujerk,4,Wed Jun 24 22:42:23 2015 UTC,There is a reason all professional sports must approach the organization a player is contracted to. Poaching in professional sports is just as severe (and in some cases even more severe) than Riot's punishments.
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Sasukefan99,4,Thu Jun 25 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"No, no one has been told they have to divest themselves from a team because of poaching. You get escalating fines. Taking a team away from an owner is an extreme thing that happens extraordinarily rarely in real sports and is reserved for particularly egregious things."
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Eziak,2,Thu Jun 25 03:07:55 2015 UTC,"It is, except there is always a time, typically during the off-season that you can talk to players directly, so that during the actual league, no throws can happen. But for LCS, the players are basically on lockdown all the time.  My major issue is the lying is getting punished harder than anything else. What the actual fuck? Are you the catholic church that people need to confess their sins to you? A year and a half is just too long, but that might just be my opinion."
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,poookie13,3,Thu Jun 25 01:16:15 2015 UTC,He was warned the first time. Personally I think someone should be dealt with harsher if they were reprimanded once without consequence and did the same exact thing again.
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Sasukefan99,3,Thu Jun 25 01:46:40 2015 UTC,Agreed with the harshness. But other poachers were given just a fine. This guy is banned for a year and a half... isn't that a bit overkill?
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,poookie13,0,Thu Jun 25 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"Show a single instance in professional sports where an owner was forced to sell his portion of a team(s) for talking to players about opportunities on their team.  Seriously, no.   In addition, it is countered by the fact that previous poaching in LCS has been met with fines, not the banishment of an owner.   This was a personal ""We don't like you"" attack disguised as a ""competitive"" decision.  This guy has been vocal about the issues with Riots system repeatedly, especially its poaching rules, and now he gets a stiffer penalty than any previously handed out for poaching, for actions taken when not even in a Riot sponsored league (this was before RNG even got to NACS).  Does this mean that Riot has the right to block anyone for any past action they don't like?  What is the statute of limitations?"
RiotFreeLoL,3azyqy,Sajier,4,Thu Jun 25 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"Why would any other game be concerned about it? After all riot is still pretry unique in the fact that they run several leagues. Obvious that they will have more rulings than for example valve, who just run a tournament once a year.  Furthermore the problem with the current poaching rules is the time-window, and not the poaching rule per se. As in allow negotiations already 3 months before the contract ends and not just afterwards, and that is what has been object to criticism. The process of asking the team first and afterwards the player was never criticized, for the simple reason that it makes sense.  Just check the tsm-keith case. Regi asks liquid, they say ok so regi can talk to keith and he agrees. Thats how it should be. No drama, no problems."

Understandably the players became unhappy with Freeze's status in the team and eventually Freeze's behaviour may have changed for the worse too. That was probably the biggest mistake Dentist made, he shouldn't have discussed Freeze's earnings.

Cercei allows a cult called the Sparrows to take martial law over the city and they take root by feeding the poor. Cercei is herself taken prisoner by the Sparrows as they begin to crackdown and moral crusade. She is asked to repent every day while she rots away in a dingy cell until she agrees to confess. They shave her hair off and make her walk naked from the church to the castle butt ass naked while a nun followed behind her chanting shame shame shame then dinging a bell twice. The entire time villagers are dumping shit and piss onto Cercei and exposing themselves at her.

RiotFreeLoL,3axahh,quesadillakid,2,Wed Jun 24 09:58:17 2015 UTC,Tbh I understand what dentist was doing when he was giving Freeze the most money. He is trying to keep his star player because he is their only player who is top 3 in his position and all the other players can easily be replaced. However he is taking the extra money aswell which is kind of a dick move unless it is being paid to him by management because they don't want him to leave aswell.

RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,TaiTay,2,Mon Jun 22 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"fans are defending turtle like he's some legacy player that carried TSM for a few years. realistically... he came just before Bjergsen replaced Reginald and rode the coattails of a team that had an enormous midlane advantage which allowed them to win games even if the rest of the lanes fell to shit. i feel for him having to endure support changes (xpecial -> gleeb -> lustboy), but really, he got away with much of the blame primarily being tossed onto other players"
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,matthitsthetrails,3,Tue Jun 23 16:34:55 2015 UTC,they are tsm fans after all. What did you expect? Its been like this since tsm started building their fan base. Everybody hated Dyrus when he joined and they defenden rainman even though rainman obviously had no interest in putting in more effort. They hated wild turtle when he joined and defended chaox and so on and so forth. Always the same
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,lurkedlongtime,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"While I do agree it's time for a change. Wildturtle played for nearly a year before bjergsen came To NA and him and Xpecial looked like the only world class players on TSM at worlds that year (s3)  So he had a lot of fans from that. But I imagine that mostly the thing is Wildturtle is mediocre he always got hate for the wrong things.  Last split people rode the turtle doesn't know how to position when in reality, that's what turtle did well. He was a poor laner but showed up in team fights.  Now this split he has neither. But TSM honestly should have made this move sooner and with a very good adc   If TSM wants to be world class, they got To have ""the other guy"" the guy that if a team commits to bjergsen too hard. The other will wreck their shit. They got to have the other carry. And I dont think turtle can be that guy.  Of course that's asking a lot. No doubt. But I can't shake the feeling that a guy like altec who as soon as he got on a decent team looks like the best ADC NA. Could atleast help.   But realistically. TSM could have imported. Got a guy like Freeze or Forgiven (doubt his team fit tho).   Tsm has 2 foreign slots due to a rule revision"
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,matthitsthetrails,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you said. Altec should've been the guy to go after... or TSM should've been more assertive in finding replacement/sub players, especially with all the fallout from EG that happened. GV got a huge upgrade without losing anything"
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,Str8UpBall3r,2,Wed Jun 24 01:28:22 2015 UTC,I dont see why they would keep turtle. He just seems like a weak ADC and that TSM could do much better. Keith might be an improvement in the long term but tbh I think they need a better ADC in the short term before worlds. There are a few EU challenger players that could join like Kobbe or maybe some from NA (I dont watch any of the NA challenger games but apparently Stixxay and LoD are good). Just seemed like TSM missed their opportunity to pick up a good ADC like Altec or Rallez when they were relegated.
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,gahlo,5,Mon Jun 22 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"They can't get EU players because of Santorin, Lust, and Bjergsen."
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,Viruszero,2,Mon Jun 22 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"Actually due to Riot's rule Lust and Bjergsen, I think Santorin i'm not sure, can claim NA residency now freeing up two of TSM foreign player slots."

I dont believe TSM would swap ADCs now, so close to worlds, and tbh im not sure that NA really has a better ADC alternative to Turtle right now. On top of that there were loads of great foreign ADCs on the market over the break, so i doubt that this is anything other than a countermeasure to ensure Turtle doesnt get complacent."

Lust bjergsen, santorin all played in NA before the rule changed  So they were ENRs in riots eyes. Exempt non residents.  ENR as of this split doesn't exist. Instead they ask players to declare a region.  Lustboy can say I'm not Korean I'm NA now (and he probably Did given how much he hates Korea)  Same with bjergsen and santorin.  If those 3 declare NA. They are the 3 ""NA "" players for riots 3/5s rule."

RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,Volkerman,3,Mon Jun 22 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Found it kind of weird they publicly announced a in-house tryout. Also considering he's still under contract, kind of found it odd he was decked out in TSM gear."
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,himynameisfil,2,Tue Jun 23 01:38:07 2015 UTC,"I think TSM wants to control the information about the matter so they  made the video and released it before journalists would report on it.   Although you bring up an interesting point about wildturtle's contract. I wonder if Keith is a starter, will wildturtle just be a sub until a team is willing to buy out his contract(Which I'd imagine would be for a pretty penny considering it's TSM)."
RiotFreeLoL,3aqz0b,Volkerman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"If TSM does make this permanent they're going to paying some serious dollars to buyout Keith and still pay Wildturtle's contract.

It's a classic move, either Turtle steps up his game and Regi looks like a genius for lighting a fire under him, or he doesn't and Regi looks like a genius for replacing him. I think they want Turtle to keep his job and this is a last ditch effort to see if he really still has what it takes. I hope Turtle stomps Team 8 and shows he is good enough to be world class."

And when you call it plagiarism, hilariously using your logic there you could argue the same thing about RL's work then, since you know, the announcements he makes aren't his announcements, they are other people's announcements that he reports on, as per the fact journalists report news, they don't create said news. So RL is profiting of off other people's work, and he is actually profiting from it in a tangible way, unlike the mods.  Or we could actually use the definition of plagiarism to point out how bullshit your statement was.   the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.   It's a very specific thing, plagiarism. Which the mods, or anyone else in that thread clearly aren't doing.  Realistically, the /r/lol sub is discussing the news that RL also happens to have reported on, and regardless of who reported it, it would still be being discussed there, so the notion that they are profiting or plagiarising from RL's work it is ridiculous."

RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,j4kz,-3,Tue Jun 23 21:25:06 2015 UTC,Are you actually trying to say Kaceytron is more entertaining than Trick2g? GTFO
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,RoughRunner,2,Sat Jun 20 03:50:20 2015 UTC,If thats what people are getting out of what I wrote...just holy shit.

RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,PershingSt,0,Sat Jun 20 01:19:21 2015 UTC,Best imo is when he plays H1Z1. Dude is hilarious.
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,iamhipbob,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"He plays in a particular way and he is good at it. He knows the strenghts of the champs he plays and plays against. He knows when and how to move around the map. Hes a good solo q player. I don't like him because of his attitude and he lost me completly when he copyrighted the term ""subwars"". One thing that he does right about teaching is constantly saying to viewers to don't try to copy his playstyle, to learn to play tanky before trying to go damage and to focus on farming rather than kills. He knows he influence on his viewers and he constantly tell them to don't make common mistakes and to ""learn the game"" before try to play like him. He also does espectates (wich he charges for) and he analyze some plays and explains how to do them better. He's a jerk and not a role model, but there are some good things about his stream. He's not the worst."
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,moba_kings,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:32:21 2015 UTC,You should watch valkrins stream. I've been watching it for a long time and i think its really good for both gameplay and analysis.

RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,-1,Sat Jun 20 04:17:41 2015 UTC,Honestly Id rather play with a trick2g fan boy than just some random. At least the trick fan would trycand get an early objective. I think he's fine but his appeal applies to a niech audiance
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,Jon_Himself,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:45:40 2015 UTC,wow why did you get downvoted? it's okay what you said i think
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:06:32 2015 UTC,"It's really simple, the fact is that people don't like  carry style and objective focused junglers. Most players are Bronze to Gold elo and in those level play people tend to prefer a gank heavy/ skirmish jungler because a lack of in game strategy and understanding of their champion timings. As a result SoloQ is like TDM and when you got 4 people TDMing it(TEAM DEATH MATCH) with 1 guy playing the dragon/tower game you get a lot of people mad."
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,Jon_Himself,-2,Mon Jun 22 15:48:31 2015 UTC,How about you let people what whatever the fuck they want. Nobody is making you watch him.
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"He never stated you couldn't or shouldn't watch him, your overreaction has done nothing but paint a very ugly picture of the demographic that Trick appeals to."
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,Jon_Himself,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:59:14 2015 UTC,I don't watch Trick. I don't find him even remotely entertaining.
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:02:18 2015 UTC,Then why are you lashing out like an angry child at a statement he never made?
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,-1,Sat Jun 20 19:05:43 2015 UTC,Who is he to decide which streamers are worth watching and which ones are free to be belittled for the sound of their voice etc which he did in other replies before I even posted. I'm getting fucking tired of morons coming into reddit bitching about a streamer not meeting their specific criteria.
RiotFreeLoL,3age7e,CADeleted,0,Sat Jun 20 19:19:27 2015 UTC,"Except he never made that claim. You seem to be struggling to grasp that point and frankly now that's it's been presented to you no less than three times and still not getting through it's time to stop trying to coddle the idiot.  All he did was share his views on a particular streamer, and asked what exactly it is people find appealing about him.   Have a nice day."

RiotFreeLoL,3af0k9,Freudido,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:34:36 2015 UTC,It depends on how behind you are. With lategamecomps you should go for even at minimum. Otherwise how do you think you will get to the late game?

I mean of course: Start moving  to lanes / ward / leash, But I hate  it when people  say  ""its Minute 4:30 and jungle zero ganks"" cause techincally the lanes  started  just  2 minutes  ago."
