I probably couldn't commit to a weekly game if that's what you are looking for. My group mostly does single sessions due to conflicting schedules
grandrapids,3e4k7c,barbellon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"We are looking to play once a week or at least bi-weekly, but I'll talk to the other people and see what they think about a single-session campaign. Thanks!  edit: From what I've read 4e and 5e are pretty different, with 4e being more combat focused where 5e is a more customizable experience. It's easy to pick up though, and non-combat encounters are still fun and very present!"

Except in the link you shared, it explicitly says that you can own an owl as long as you are licensed. I think /u/yogi89 is assuming that the tenant has all the legal paperwork, but wondering if a licensed falconer can legally house a bird of prey in a residential rental property.  Regardless of it all, I can't imagine the landlord would want a fully-grown owl tearing up the property and threatening the danger of other tenants. OP, talk to the landlord."

They have some cool shirts and sweatshirts, more touristy stuff than anything. They were a bit pricey through, $30 a shirt but still worth it because the designs are pretty cool compared to most places. There's also a hand full of shops right on Monroe center (mostly candles, clothes, misc. artwork) as well as a neat paper shop right along the strip. I believe my boyfriend went there once to buy a couple cards for family members. Taking a stroll down south Division can be cool sometimes, but never at night.

Michigan is shaped like a mitten and is known as the mitten state......there are mitten shaped things in almost every store (cutting boards and other kitchen gadgets, etc).  You could probably find mitten shaped pendants and earrings pretty easily. The state is also a large producer of cherries and Macinac Island fudge is pretty famous. GR is also known for Art Prize and I'm sure you could pick up some nice prints or ceramics from local artists. We've only been here a few months and have already picked up several nice pieces at some of the festivals in the area. You shouldn't have any problem finding something for her whatever your budget."

If that isn't your thing, I would check out some of the small little shops and such in Eastown, Cherry Hill, Wealthy street or Fulton street shopping districts.

There's also the wine in Traverse City, which ranges from iffy versions of the standard fare (cabs, pinots, etc) all the way to top of the line rieslings and cherry wines. Booze is never a bad gift, but in a situation like this, I'm sure there's better.  Wolverine (the shoe company) is based in Rockford, about 10 miles north of the city.

The catch is...it needs to have decent internet    Well, your in luck -- Grand Rapids doesn't really have ""good"" internet anywhere, so your not likely to suffer in any significant way by being far away from it. ;)  There's plenty of empty land around. I'd hop on Zillow or GRAR and start searching. Both let you specify a minimum ""lot size"" which should help you find houses on large / oversized lots.

Just listen to the self-righteous comments below from smug leftists that launch right into their usual sanctimonious slurs at people that dare not adhere to their group-think.

Superintendent of the Kalamazoo District for the United Methodist Church, Rev. John Boley, whose office did not return phone calls nor emails, disapproved of Hutchinson’s sexuality and forced the pastor to either resign or face termination. Hutchison chose resignation, a choice local church members find heartbreaking.   This isn't the church kicking him out, this is the head organization kicking him out despite the wishes of the church. I agree, it's the church's right to have the person leading it to be in tune with their beliefs...and that's exactly what was happening before. The people making this decision are the hierarchy who are detached from this church physically and more.  I read in another article a lot of people are leaving it because of this.

grandrapids,3djgaw,hurricanekristy,2,Fri Jul 17 01:36:48 2015 UTC,Based on your other response (of being apprehensive of having him off a leash without fences) it's worth noting that I didn't notice actual enclosures at Kirk Park.  The vast majority of dogs were off-leash as well.  It's a wonderful location- well worth the drive.  Lots of people bring toys and balls - this is often frowned upon at other parks.
grandrapids,3djgaw,sonaaon,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured. It would be nice to jog on the shore with him though.

We have met several really cool people there that are happy to strike up a conversation while the pups run around.  Hope this helps!  *Should say that we haven't been in a few months since we're busy trying to buy a house -- unfortunate if there are now ""dickbags"" hanging out."
grandrapids,3djgaw,l3rockett,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"We went a few times in the fall and spring, but it was just that last time. The lady had two friendly but out of control pits (who were really just playing rough, but were playing), and some guy started hollering about ""Control the pits! Get the pits out of here!"" and ""That behavior is acceptable for Hillcrest, but not here!"" And the fear aggressive dog kept backing into a corner (literally) and snapping at the other dogs, and the anti-pit guy was all ""HE'S GETTING BIT HE'S BEING ATTACKED"" and I wanted to be like ""No, he's doing the attacking, but a fear aggressive dog like that probably shouldn't be here.""  So we left, and haven't been back in a couple months :/ Hopefully we can go in the next couple weekends, our dog made some dog friends the last handful of times we went."
grandrapids,3djgaw,l3rockett,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:08 2015 UTC,"Covell Park is nice. It's all grass, but there is not a separate small dog area.   There's also Hillcrest Park, off of Fuller. This one does have a separate small dog area, but all of the park is covered in wood chips. I've also had a few issues with dog owners at Hillcrest not paying attention to their dogs, as well as getting some beef for having a pittie, so I'm not a huge fan.   If you have the money for it, Shaggy Pines is extremely nice."

grandrapids,3djgaw,penguin_tuxedo,2,Fri Jul 17 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"These are all the same as l3rockett posted, but I'll add my own comments.  Covell Park is pretty basic, but people are generally friendly and laid back.   I've had problems at Hillcrest with people acting like the doggy park police too. They tried telling me that my small dog wasn't allowed in with the larger dogs, though she was perfectly fine and comfortable (I had two other larger dogs with me and didn't want to split them up). Usually people are laid back, but it's a busier park so you get the occasional busybody.  Shaggy Pines is amazing. My dad signed up his dog for it for a couple of months and it's pretty awesome. There's a pond in the first area and tons of space. Only reason my dad stopped going was because of the cost and that it's out of the way for him.  So not many options, but there ya go. I wish we had a few more dog parks so that the few ones that are there don't get so crowded."

Switched to Covell, but better all around, but the last time we went had two over energetic  (but friendly) pits get in a scuffle with a fear aggressive shepherd mix (?) and the owners got in an argument. Haven't been back since. My best friend's aunt takes her Cocker to Shaggy Pines to walk the trails. We've also been to the dog beach in Muskegon, and there's going to be a new 21 acre off-leash park opening in Jenison in September (super excited about that!). That one says it is going to be free to the public, but with such a big space I would worry about someone leaving a gate open at a less visited area, and the usual ""This park is for everyone"" type to show up with their bad attitude and naughty dogs."

grandrapids,3dgob1,gojo345,8,Mon Jul 20 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"Geeks, Makers, and programmers lend me your Inboxes! The tenth annual BarCamp Grand Rapids will be on Friday, August 21 and Saturday, August 22, 2015 at Calvin College’s DeVos Communications Center.  To register and attend for free, visit: http://barcampgr.org/register/  New to BarCampGR or want more information? Read on!  What is BarCampGR?  BarCamp is about meeting interesting people, talking about what you want to talk about, and listening to what you're interested in. Subjects of discussion have ranged from web programming and digital photography to computer vision and turkey basting. (No, there wasn't a talk on having a computer visually monitor your turkey, but if you've tried it, you're welcome to report on your experiences!) You see, the talks are not set beforehand, it's you, the attendees, who give BarCampGR direction and content.  What's the format?  Presentations are 25 minutes long, with five minutes in between. You're welcome to sit in on a presentation or hang around in the lounge and talk; it's all the same with us. If you run a presentation, we don't care how you run it - so long as you don't get us in trouble! Give a monologue, a Q&A or a round table; it's your topic, your presentation, your audience. If people didn't want to spend 25 minutes on your topic, they wouldn't be there.  Don't know what to talk about?  Certainly you have some relatively unique experiences. What do you do for a hobby? What's something you managed to fix that you're proud of? It doesn't matter if the height of your accomplishment is changing your car's oil or if you've war-driven half of the Grand Rapids area; if people are interested, they will show up at your talk. If they aren’t interested, they will probably attend one of the other talks during that time.  But I'm not an expert!  Sure you are! If you know the first thing about a subject, you know more than people who don't. And, yes, people who know more than you will probably attend your presentation. Interact with them; you both have something to learn from each other. Chances are, if you're both really interested in a subject, you'll find yourselves looking for each other in the lounge, later. But perhaps you're...  Shy?  That's fine. Come on in, take a look around and get a feel for things. It's a two-day event; come by on Friday, sit in on the presentations which interest you or hang around in the lounge and network with other people. Perhaps you'll be inspired to talk about something later, or on Saturday. You never really know. If you'd like to be able to listen, but don't know if you'll have anything to say, you can still...  Help Out  On the days of the event itself, we typically need greeters, people to babysit the facility overnight (some folks stay overnight), people to respond to technical issues such as ""why won't the projector work with my laptop"" and ""could someone turn down the lights so we could see the screen?"" We also have a subreddit again this year, r/BarCampGR. Use it to ask for certain subjects to be covered. Use it to offer subjects that you can talk about. During the event, use it to have almost-live discussions about things with people who aren't immediately present. After the event, use it to post supplemental materials and ask followup questions. We have a lot of other ways you can keep up to date on BarCampGR news and updates via the following social media outlets:   Website: http://barcampgr.org Twitter: @barcampgr Slack: http://barcampgr.slack.org ( Replaces IRC ) Subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/BarCampGR/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/BarCampGR/112347402141619 Google+: https://plus.google.com/b/116952079842867940611/   Also, if you'd like to help us organize BarCampGR, then sign up for the BarCampGR Organizers' Email Group and jump right into the conversation at http://lists.barcampgr.org/listinf…/organizers-barcampgr.org, or join the Slack team noted above.  We have specific need this year for help with T-shirt designs; if you would care to submit a t-shirt design that we can use for this year's shirts, please contact us on Slack or on the mailing list. CODE OF CONDUCT  You can read our code of conduct here:   http://barcampgr.org/code-of-conduct/   REGISTRATION  http://barcampgr.org/register/  LOCATION  DeVos Communications Center at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI  SCHEDULE  Friday, August 21, 2015  5:00-6:00 PM - Check-in and setup  6:00-7:00 PM - Dinner  7:00 PM - Kick things off with opening session  7:30-9:30 PM - Sessions every 1/2 hour  9:30 PM - After party  Overnight  10:00 PM-whenever the next morning - Camping, all-night hacking, etc.  There will be plenty of room to crash on Friday night, so bring a sleeping bag.

I won't get into details about the more complicated stuff, but they do charge fees for plenty of repairs that are normal wear and tear on a home. Not to mention they are terrible at returning calls and answering emails, even if a response is specifically requested. Their organization as an operating business also seems chaotic, though it's not as bad as it was when we began renting with them. What it really comes down to is that from the tenant's perspective, they don't actually give a fuck about us, and they view college students as a source of income for exploitation.

They were outstanding. Fixed everything, they were never shitty about any issues we brought up, the rent was good, fees like deposit and animal fees were reasonable, and they even let us change terms like getting a dog, which a lot of companies will just say no to because it's not worth the bother.   On the flip side we had a generally 'meh' experience with the Fulton Group. We went in to find a house to rent and they really didn't listen to what we wanted and kept showing us weird options. They do have a ton of options thought usually, and generally a number of options for people in a budget like yourself. They were friendly and also seem to have fairly reasonable fees.   I recommend checking in with both, but I personally vouch for Lighthouse"

grandrapids,3d9vqj,wilsonw,6,Tue Jul 14 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"Can also look into flying to Muskegon, Kalamazoo, or Lansing. Much smaller airports than GRR, but you can find random flights to be cheap into them sometimes."

grandrapids,3d9vqj,KombatKid,3,Tue Jul 14 17:34:29 2015 UTC,"Flying into ORD or DTW is going to probably be your best bet, and then renting a car from there if there are several of you.  Wouldn't recommend the Lake Express unless you're making a real vacation of it, it's great to get across the lake in a hurry (2 hrs to Milwaukee from Muskegon, for $140?  Awesome compared to driving) but when you can choose to fly into Chicago and avoid the lake, it makes less sense.  Also...Muskegon's not connected to Grand Rapids in any sort of way...there's no way to get there except then to use Uber or some other car service, or rent a car there.  So, that last 45 minutes back to GR is going to be so close, and yet so far.  Keep watching fares into GR, but check on Chicago and Detroit too.  Detroit's going to be a shorter drive, but you also have to fly into Detroit.    Where's the wedding in town?  Bus service isn't terrible, but there are some bare spots where it's hard to get, especially later in the evening like...after a wedding, say.  We do have Uber service, at least somewhat.  I've never used it myself, but others here have.    Because it's quite a suburban town, I'm going to opine that having your own rental car is likely to be an advantage, not a disadvantage.  Also, most parking is free, except along the streets in town and in the parking ramps downtown.  If you're staying outside town at all, you won't have to pay for parking."
grandrapids,3d9vqj,andpassword,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! The wedding is actually north of GR about 45 minutes. I am thinking I'll fly to Chicago or Detroit and snag a car. Hopefully coordinating schedules with some friends will cut down on costs.

Thoughts also when looking at Megabus, Amtrak or Greyhound into GR. You have to get from the airport to the their terminal.

Unless you opened your fridge when the power went out and left it open until the power came back on, nothing should be over 50 degrees or so in there, and i'd be surprised if it got that high at all.  When the power comes back, it will be chilled back to the 40 degree mark within one hour (on average) and at that point, while certainly it would be better to leave things under full refrigeration, 1-2 hours at a temperature of 45-50 is not going to be hazardous unless a) you were already courting the Line of Moldy Disaster and b) you have a compromised immune system.

grandrapids,3d1np7,oddoboy,3,Mon Jul 13 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"While I love the idea of it, wood fires of any kind are actually pretty harmful:   Here is what we know from a scientific point of view: There is no amount of wood smoke that is good to breathe. It is at least as bad for you as cigarette smoke, and probably much worse. (One study found it to be 30 times more potent a carcinogen.) The smoke from an ordinary wood fire contains hundreds of compounds known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and irritating to the respiratory system. Most of the particles generated by burning wood are smaller than one micron—a size believed to be most damaging to our lungs. In fact, these particles are so fine that they can evade our mucociliary defenses and travel directly into the bloodstream, posing a risk to the heart. Particles this size also resist gravitational settling, remaining airborne for weeks at a time.  Once they have exited your chimney (or firepit), the toxic gases (e.g. benzene) and particles that make up smoke freely pass back into your home and into the homes of others. (Research shows that nearly 70 percent of chimney smoke reenters nearby buildings.) Children who live in homes with active fireplaces or woodstoves, or in areas where wood burning is common, suffer a higher incidence of asthma, cough, bronchitis, nocturnal awakening, and compromised lung function. Among adults, wood burning is associated with more-frequent emergency room visits and hospital admissions for respiratory illness, along with increased mortality from heart attacks. The inhalation of wood smoke, even at relatively low levels, alters pulmonary immune function, leading to a greater susceptibility to colds, flus, and other respiratory infections. All these effects are borne disproportionately by children and the elderly.   Here is a link to the study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17127644"

Humans learned that cooking or preserving food with salt would cause a lot less foodborne illness. Before we knew what germs were, doctor's used to not wash their hands. Once they did then surgery recovery rates skyrocketed. Learning that cigarettes were harmful and putting out massive awareness campaigns is proving to lower lung cancer."

grandrapids,3d1np7,oddoboy,3,Tue Jul 21 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunetly this is not accurate... See excerpt below taken from grcity fire department   General Guidelines Cooking: For the purpose of this ordinance, the mere presence of nearby food DOES NOT qualify as an exemption. For the food preparation to be considered, a number of factors need to be present including, but not limited to: • The device being used for the fire is designed for the cooking of food, as its primary purpose. In addition, the fire officer in charge shall approve the device and its location, from a safety perspective. • The fire will be small in nature, and would depend upon the heat from the embers for cooking, rather than from flame contact. • When the food preparation was completed, the fire would be extinguished. • The gathering of food and support goods after the arrival of the fire department will exclude consideration as a cooking fire. • Fires on or in the ground will not be considered. As a policy, the Grand Rapids Fire Department will NOT participate in efforts to orchestrate an exemption. Some examples of Open Burning that are NOT allowed in the City of Grand Rapids are: 1. Outdoor Portable Fire Pits 2. Chimeneas 3. Recreational Fires"

Simply having hot dogs on standby does not technically allow you to have a fire in an elevated metal ""fire pit"". However, you are unlikely to ever hear anything from the fire dept or police unless you a. have neighbors that hate you for valid or invalid reasons 1. are doing something obviously unsafe III. are having your thing in a very visible location iv. some combination of the above. On occasions I have discussed this with a local fire chief I was told that they certainly aren't patrolling for this and generally just want to keep things safe.  They do also have some discretion in these matters so if you are reasonable with them if they ever do show up, you can probably get away with just complying with their directions and extinguishing the fire."

I think the idea of a video game / pc gaming / console gaming ""store"" and the actual profitability of one are two different things. GrandLAN's rigs are pretty weak and the store itself isn't anything special so I'd much rather stay home or LAN with my buds. I think it's just hard to be profitable and that's why there isn't a great dedicated store in the area offering it all. Sure it'd be a great concept but it's hard to make rent in downtown GR selling time on gaming machines, consoles, hosting tabletop tourneys and selling old games."

grandrapids,3clw22,grtechguy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"If you think it's bad now, you should have seen it 10 years ago. Before they connected Baldwin to 196,the only way out of Jenison for virtually everyone north of Chicago Drive was Baldwin to Chicago Drive to 196. If a train came through - or stopped on the tracks - all of Jenison was shut down briefly. That interchange between Baldwin and the freeway was badly needed and unclogged Jenison as it was. Rerouting traffic across a new, expensive bridge over the river to M-11 or Lake Michigan drive isn't going to fix anything."

grandrapids,3cez25,Retomx,3,Tue Jul 7 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"I live near the EKH area. There's a lot of food there, there's a sports bar there (I'm sure you know you can't drink until 21 in the US, but if you go before 9PM you can partake in the atmosphere), there's also a first-run movie theater pretty much across the street from the school. As far as downtown, everybody else has said what I would have said, but you're lucky to be in the EKH area as it has recently grown up a lot.  As for recreation, you'll make a lot of friends pretty easily, many of which will likely have cars, so expect to go to Lake Michigan pretty often in the summer. It's a great way to waste a day with fun."

If you would like a code for $20 off your first ride, please pm me.  I don't spam my code on reddit.  I don't know if NZ forbids public transportation in the states, but I've given quite a few Chinese exchange students rides through uber, which is permitted, apparently   Welcome to west michigan!"

I'm heading out for work very soon, but DM me if you'd like to chat over Skype etc. I also played rugby in high school here in Grand Rapids and at the D1 level in college (uni) here in the states, so if you're interested that I could connect you with some local high school clubs."

grandrapids,3cez25,amgwlee93,2,Tue Jul 7 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"Congratulations and welcome! Insider info, eh?    Grand Rapids is the 2nd largest city in Michigan, although it's really not that well-known outside of the Midwest USA. Detroit is about a 3-hour drive to the east, and just past that is Canada.  Chicago is about a 3 hour drive to the south-west. West Michigan is lacking in diversity, you may be surprised to see the relative absence of minorities, especially compared to the East side of the state. To me, that's the #1 bad thing about this area, it's just so white!  Here is what I would say is a must-do list for you, assuming you're here for a whole school year (Sept 2015-May 2016):   ArtPrize (in the fall) Weekend in Detroit, Chicago, or both Visit the beach in Grand Haven or Saugatuck Downhill skiing/snowboarding/tubing in the winter (we are not Colorado, but unless you're really experienced, the local resorts will be challenging enough) Whitecaps Baseball game Griffins Ice Hockey game Visit Fredrick Meijer Gardens in the spring or fall Tulip Time (festival) in Holland in May 2016   But /u/Froggr said it best - just say ""yes"" to everything and you're pretty much assured of a great experience."

You can find plenty of minorities in GR, they just aren't hanging around craft breweries or at the farmer's market nor do they live in places all of the white hipsters here will be caught dead in.

It could have been miles away at the time OP found it. OP should take it the Kent County Animal Shelter and see if it has been micro chipped.

Did something go wrong at the end, or was it just idiots who've never seen a fireworks show up close? Someone mentioned something about a fire on the bridge (the ped. bridge where they were being set off), and everyone ran over to look, but I think it was just the usual finale where things do tend to get a little smokey-firey chaotic-looking. I was too far back to see. What brainiac decided to drive a firetruck down Pearl from the YMCA down toward 131, when traffic was first letting out? My pary are with the person frantically reversing down Pearl to get out of the way of the firetruck wrong-waying nose-to-nose with them up the turn-lane. Exceptional front-yard-yahoo fireworks this year. Probably due to the 4th being on a Saturday, but there are really some A-game, high quality (and probably high-dollar) fireworks going off, at least in my neighborhood."

The easy answer for you (since you're renting from UHaul) is to store at one of the UHaul storage facilities. I found out a few months ago -- looking for a unit to rent -- that all of the (more local, ""family business"" type) places would not reserve a unit for me. If I wanted a place, it was first-come-first-served, they wanted my money and my lease would start that day -- even if I wasn't moving anything into the unit for another month.   Since this is my first time renting a unit -- and I was looking on a budget (not sure if this is the case for places like PODS or ZippyShell, for example) -- I'm not sure if this is the standard but I figured I'd pass that along to you just in case."

That way your car is near once the game is over (also, parking kinda sucks at Bob's). The march to the stadium is a great experience.  If you don't purchase your game tickets ahead of time online, be sure to have cash--my understanding is that the ticket windows at Houseman can't take credit/debit.   At the game, cheer loud and cheer proud. If you don't mind standing and being with a loud group, head to the far west side of the bleachers and join the supporters group, The Grand Army.

It has variation in the holes, but is overall not a very large course and not all that difficult barring the couple holes with lots of trees. Other parks I enjoy quite a bit are Jay Cee Park, Cascade Park, and Brewer Park.   Riverside Park is OK if you don't mind a LOT of water hazards (about 5 holes will go either right along the river or into a peninsula type thing with water on almost all sides, I usually skip these holes, lost enough discs already). This park also tends to be the busiest from what I've seen.  Lamar Park in Wyoming is OK, it's very easy and only 9 holes.  Fallasburg Park in Lowell is a really tough course (tight trees, long) but is nice and just outside of GR.  I know there's a few more around but those are the ones I'm most familiar with."
grandrapids,3bvku3,mxtrav,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you and I have the same disc golf tastes. My chucker group goes to mainly the courses you mentioned, having only recently discovered old farm. I really like old farm for its mix of long and short holes, wooded and open holes, and relatively low occurrences of water hazards. The only down side at old farm is the holes are practically on top of each other, but that's only a minor drawback. At riverside, we always start walking back to the cars at the first hole that goes out on a peninsula, right by the pavilions. To much plastic has been lost in those waters. And the goose poo can be rather thick."

grandrapids,3bvku3,cavlub,3,Thu Jul 2 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"The best courses within a reasonable driving distance are to the west. Shore Acres is in Saugatuck, about a 40 minute drive down I-196, and is worth every mile. Huge elevation changes and variation throughout. It ranges from tight technical shots through trees to 500 foot downhill big-arm shots.  Macatawa Green space deserves a mention as well. It used to be the golf course of Holland country club, so everything is mapped very well. The only downside here is that the rough is extremely rough.

grandrapids,3bvku3,Aceofpwnage,2,Thu Jul 2 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"For your average player it's a relatively risky course. It's a fun course and I enjoy playing it because of it's convenience, but there's others that I choose over it when I'm not being lazy. I learned to disc at riverside and I actually learned left handed throwing before right handed, simply because of the little bit of extra safety it gives me in terms of landing in the water (most of the traps are on the lefthand side there).  Edit: There's also technically two courses there which is nice, the longer one we're speaking about and then the shorter one that's more precision shooting (too bad it's almost always flooded)"
grandrapids,3bvku3,lacubriously,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"Brewer is good, there's a shorter more wooded 18, and a more open longer field course. I prefer the field course. In Hudsonville there's a small easy Park called Hughes. It's technical and wooded, but rather short. My favorite course is in Saugatuck, it's called shore acres. That is a very difficult and long course, but loads of fun.  The rest have pretty much been mentioned already. If you got the time to drive, go to shore acres or flip city up north in Shelby. Flip city is the ninth ranked course in the nation, I believe."
grandrapids,3bvku3,aarone46,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:51 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a drive from GR, but Hammond Hill in Hastings is a pretty good course, in my opinion.

grandrapids,3bw7gc,derekdevries,3,Thu Jul 2 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on which lanterns they order. I worked with the PR firm that helped the artists organize Lights in the Night in 2012 and they placed a special order for lanterns that were made from rice paper with wood hoops and a fuel source that was essentially wool and wax (held in place with cotton string). In addition, they also ordered them without the individual plastic wrapping that each lantern would otherwise come packaged in to further minimize the waste.  Some lanterns have a metal hoop which is, obviously, not biodegradable (hopefully it's not those).  I went out on clean-up detail after the LITN event and was actually impressed at how fast the lanterns we ordered began to degrade. It was difficult to fish them out of the river because they had already started to come apart. As a result of the wind patterns, the lanterns do tend to drop in concentrations (and the fuel pack will usually only keep them aloft for a few minutes so they don't travel very far).  In addition to having a clean-up crew, LITN also partnered with the Gilmore Collection and each lantern had a tag on it that was worth a free appetizer at the B.O.B. and an entry to win a vacation (to help encourage people to pick them up and properly dispose of them). Don't know if this event is doing anything like that."
grandrapids,3bw7gc,hayfab,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:34:51 2015 UTC,They have a crew in place to chase them down (storm chaser style) to collect about 90% of them and the lanterns are 100% biodegradable.

As someone who actually holds their ATF permit for 1.3G explosives, this is probably not the case. Those fireworks are STRICTLY regulated and even one mis-step will land you in federal prison, which makes me sceptical that someone would be using it to light display fireworks all day long. If you are referring to people lighting salutes (the ones that make your house shake), it is probably because someone got them from a bootlegger, not because they have their permit and decided to use it whenever they wanted."

This is the property where Land and Company famously decided to evict everyone one day because they wanted to sell it to a developer. It's the same one that came up during Land's campaign. It's sat there for something like ten years without anyone developing it. It's not hard to see why given its location hidden behind a gas station and motel in what could easily be called the seediest part of Grandville. In this case ""conveniently located near freeway access"" means the property is bordered on one side by a double on-ramp. The ""underutilized"" gravel pit that makes up most of the rest of the border isn't exactly Versluis Lake, and has some serious heavy industry wasteland on the other side of it.

grandrapids,3bib2p,thrylkyl,2,Mon Jun 29 21:30:12 2015 UTC,MossIT just told me about this post!  My wife and I just had our honeymoon. We spent 8 days in the U.P. with our base being in Marquette. We rented a cabin on Lake Superior by the Iron Ore Heritage Trail system about 3 miles east of Marquette.  We did a ton of hiking and biking around Picture Rocks National Lakeshore. Completed some trails we had not done yet. Also biked all around Marquette.  The best part was driving all the way up to the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula which included about 10 miles of two-track to the very end.  It was absolutely awesome.  Stopped a quite a few of the UP Breweries wherever we were.  We also met Ginger Zee from Good Morning America while at Picture Rocks. She was doing a live broadcast from Miner's Castle.

grandrapids,3bib2p,NZOR,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"A little late to the party, but it's my anniversary today so it's appropriate.   My wife and I were living in South Bend, IN when we got married (in 2000) and had never really been to Michigan except for places just over the state line. We'd traveled a lot in the US, and we hate hot weather, so we were looking for a honeymoon spot that wasn't tropical, wasn't crowded, wasn't some place we'd already been, and which did have a lot of outdoor things to do. We decided on a 10-day driving tour up from South Bend to Mackinac Island, then the UP, then back down through Wisconsin.   So we stayed two days in Mackinac City and hiked and biked all over the island. Then up through the UP and stayed in a cabin on Lake Superior in the Porkies for three days. We loved it, especially the hiking in the UP -- so remote, just an untouched wilderness, and I dig a place where the black bears outnumber the humans 5:1.   The return leg of the trip was two days in Door County, WI but I didn't care for it -- too many rich people. I kept wanting to turn the car around and head back to the UP.   Anyway years later, in 2011 I had the opportunity to take a job at GVSU in Allendale and our awesome experience in Michigan on the honeymoon played a big role in deciding to take it."

grandrapids,3bib2p,ewife-ity,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:13:41 2015 UTC,My wife and I honeymooned in May '14 just south of Stoney lake in a cottage right on Lake Michigan. We stayed a full week and it was beautiful. Stoney lake has a great restaurant we ate at a few times and spring lake sand dunes were under a 30 minute drive. We did a repeat for a weekend this year too.

grandrapids,3bimrp,packy11,9,Mon Jun 29 15:12:30 2015 UTC,I have used runaboutsgr.com before - made my reservations in advance and they were precisely on time. It was around $15 for me to get to the airport from Kentwood; they have a fare calculator online.
grandrapids,3bimrp,GGARBAGE,4,Mon Jun 29 17:04:59 2015 UTC,I second the use of renaboutsgr - a good reliable scheduled service.
grandrapids,3bimrp,whitemice,3,Mon Jun 29 18:36:18 2015 UTC,Thanks this is definitely a decent option
grandrapids,3bimrp,cbdudek,3,Mon Jun 29 17:10:35 2015 UTC,I have used Uber about a couple weeks ago for an early morning flight to Grand Rapids at a little after 6:30.  I wanted to leave at 5am.  Uber had 3 cars running that early and I easily got there by 5:20.  I haven't tried runaboutsgr.com but that does sound amazing.  I might try that next time.
grandrapids,3bimrp,powerbookguy,5,Mon Jun 29 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"I had never used Uber before but needed to get to the airport about 6 months ago for a very early flight just like you're describing. I downloaded the app a week in advance and got my account setup. Got up the morning of, tried to get a driver around 5AM. Nothing. Ended up having to call a cab and then made a mad dash to the airport.  Possible the service has grown since then, but my advice would be to not count on them for early morning situations like this."

grandrapids,3bimrp,andi98989,2,Mon Jun 29 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"3 days of parking is likely to be ~$50.  I've parked in there any number of times and it's quite convenient, takes only a minute to get to the checkpoint from parking, and you know how you're getting home.  Of course, I can expense that because I'm usually traveling for work."

Honestly, you might want to contact Uber directly. I'm not sure if they will be able to guarantee a driver that early or not, but calling them beforehand seems it would be a better shot than trying to wing it the morning of.  Personally, I just don't want to have to worry about leaving my car. I'd much prefer to roll out of bed and crawl to an Uber than have to drink the necessary amount of coffee to not worry about being a half-asleep killing machine behind the wheel at 5am."

I helped the company fight it, even put anti-union signs on my car.  I'm not necessarily against Unionization, and I'm not one of those ""well they served their purpose blah blah"" people, either.  It's just that the UFCW is shady and ineffective as fuck. The President of the Local was actually in prison at the time for being caught instructing his client to lie to the judge. I also knew enough Meijer workers to know the horror stories, and I figured I sure as hell don't want those kinds of working conditions. Half the people who signed union authorization cards were illegals that had been talked into it because they union was advertising on local spanish radio and even came into the churches on Sunday. They even sent me a letter trying to talk me into it--that was in Spanish only. Clearly they were trying to carry this through with purely the Spanish-language speakers and didn't give two shits about the english-speakers.  Fortunately, they failed miserably (it was like 300-80 against).  I'm not saying that plant shouldn't unionize necessarily. If they choose to, they should pick a better union instead of the shitty one that panders to them."

There are usually people just chilling there during the day/evening, but they also host free swing dancing get togethers/Zumba shit certain days of the week.  If you like comics/graphic novels, check out the Vault of Midnight comic shop. It's just down the street from Rosa Parks Circle. You could also try just walking around during the evening and striking up conversations. People in GR are typically pretty friendly."

grandrapids,3bg73d,bitmanic,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:59 2015 UTC,"PedalGR is on the casual side. If you want something faster, call any bike shop and ask when their shop rides are. They tend to keep a pretty quick pace."

The complex itself isn't ghetto per say just the area off 44th isn't pleasant to look at.

(it's only $10 from GR to Chicago :( )  train will be about $32 per person http://www.amtrak.com/home  Good luck, you might want to try a Craigslist ad http://chicago.craigslist.org/search/rid"
grandrapids,3baz6b,Fishstixxx16,5,Sat Jun 27 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"The train is a great deal and very comfortable.   There are also multiple trains to Kalamazoo which is only 45mins south of Grand Rapids, and there are connecting buses - and it may be easier to find a ride from Kalamazoo to GR than from Chicago.  Another upside of the Kalamazoo trains is you will get to ride the only 110MPH trains anywhere in America outside of the North East Corridor - a bit of a trivia thing."
grandrapids,3baz6b,whitemice,3,Sat Jun 27 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"You guys, the Amtrak is not cheap anymore, and it hasn't been for a long time. Unless you book stuff way in advance, on average you're going to spend between $45-60 bucks one way ($80-100 round trip).  It's way overpriced these days."
grandrapids,3baz6b,Lions2727,2,Mon Jun 29 19:32:22 2015 UTC,I generally book a few weeks in advance and get a better price than that - and anyone who has AAA or is a NARP member gets at least a 10% discount on top of that.
grandrapids,3baz6b,whitemice,5,Mon Jun 29 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"Amtrak has train lines from Chicago to either Grand Rapids or Kalamazoo, both of which have long distance bus stops where you should be able to get a connection to Charlevoix, which I believe also has a bus stop."
grandrapids,3baz6b,thenerdygeek,3,Sat Jun 27 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, throughway bus from Kalamazoo station (trains Blue Water & Wolverine) to Charlevoix is the 8364.  It departs KZO at 2:15pm. This route stops in Grand Rapids, where it departs at 4:55pm.  You can see the Indian Trails routes @ http://www.indiantrails.com/maps-and-schedules.  Getting as far north as Charlevoix is not easy."
grandrapids,3baz6b,whitemice,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"Amtrak.   Very comfortable, and dirt cheap (cheaper than driving).    Normally like $26 per person."

I'm sure other realty companies do it as well, as it's a quick and easy money-grab for them."

There are various versions, but centrally all the same.  That is the only one I remember hearing consistently over the decades of my life in Grand Rapids.  The harp in the window above the entrance to St. Marks Episcopal. Sometimes at night near high holy days it is supposed to glow.  That is either a miracle or a ghost, depending.  I have not heard about that one for years, but it bandied about in the 80s.  People now prefer their supernatural less religious.  Besides those two the only common urban myth I hear is that there is a desperate lack of parking.  I do not believe any of these three things are true.  But they are all fun to listen to people talk about."

grandrapids,3azhbf,mikemol,8,Thu Jun 25 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"Unrelated to urban myths, but am I the only one who thinks that downtown real estate is way too valuable for a switch house?    Do you have any remote idea of the cost to relocate it?  Imagine a large spider web, and the switch house at the center of it. All of the spider web strands touching the switch house--hundreds of thousands of them--touching the switch house will need to continue to do so...but cannot be removed more than a few millimeters from where they are. So, at a cost of hundreds of thousands per strand, you could theoretically move the switch house a couple of miles, extending those strands to the new location. Except that the strands have to run through underground conduit, of which the city has only a limited supply--and charges rent for each square inch cross-section used--and not only woupd you have to double how much of that conduit you use (and pay rent for), there may not even be enough there for the purpose.  And you can't just condense all those strands into one bundle of 192 fibers with a dozen wavelengths each to get your connections down to the new location, because you'd need a switchouse to do it...  So, no, downtown real estate is not too valuable to have a switchhouse. It'd be cheaper to buy the building GrandLAN is in, tear it down to bedrock and build a copy of Bridgewater Place than to move that switchhouse."
grandrapids,3azhbf,whitemice,2,Thu Jun 25 03:10:32 2015 UTC,Yep.  I think you have to get to Manhattan level real-estate prices [thousands of dollars per sq ft] before anyone thinks about moving something like this.    I have been told that the building is much more empty than in previous decades - the equipment gets more compact / higher density.  However then there is the security problem - it might be just too much of a pain to try to multi-use such a building even though over time it becomes effectively more and more vacant.    Grand Rapids real-estate prices just aren't high enough yet.    Fortunately it is a really nice looking building - and even sports its own urban legend(s).

grandrapids,3azhbf,whitemice,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"And then - to relocate - you still need somewhere to relocate to, even after your massive splice job.  For various reasons you may not want it too far away, so your new site may end up with the same cost problem as the old site.  Besides, AT&T likely doesn't think to much about it, they have so many switch houses. No doubt some of them end up in expensive corners of the world.  I doubt it will move in my lifetime."

grandrapids,3aufuu,pharaohs_pharynx,6,Tue Jun 23 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"334-car parking shared between 300-ish renters, a ""business center"", a ""two story fitness center"", and ""a gathering place"".   So there won't be adequate parking for those folks, and renter/retail parked cars will definitely spill over into the neighborhood streets.   But it sounds like there will be less spill-over than other nearby developments, for what that's worth."
grandrapids,3aufuu,maxsilver,10,Tue Jun 23 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"There will probably be some spillover, but keep in mind that not everyone in there will own a car especially if they can walk to work along the mile. Then you take into account that much of the parking for renters would be empty during the day if they drive to work, and hopefully it wont be too bad."
grandrapids,3aufuu,KorrectingYou,7,Tue Jun 23 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it's also worth keeping in mind that the neighborhood already deals with a lot of spillover from GVSU, GRCC, Spectrum Health, and more.

This other data trails the reality that Millenials marry late if at all, and boomers are ageing into single households.  The people building housing are keenly aware of these trends.

grandrapids,3avqwl,Pnut36,2,Wed Jun 24 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"Ugh, don't get me started on Bethany Christian. Where I used to work, the head of HR decided to use them to replace the rapidly-shrinking hispanic work force (eVerify was implemented and a found a large swath of them were illegal). So, instead of having two languages spoken on site, it ballooned to about a dozen. They were putting people on the line who could only speak Burmese or Arabic, which caused a lot of problems because the floor leads only spoke Spanish and English.  Plus, the Africans and Arabs didn't want to work. It's not hard to see why considering they came from countries with agriculture-based economies, and here they were being thrown into an industrial production setting right away. There was one guy from Iraq who wanted to have HIS national holiday off, and when told he couldn't have it, he faked being unconscious so he'd get taken away in an ambulance and get the day off anyway.  It became an absolute clusterfuck.  Bethany Christian is the perfect characterization of the naive, pollyanna attitude that if we just show these people our way of life they'll just jump right in and adopt all of our values, eschewing the attitudes and ethics they were born and raised with without hesitation."

grandrapids,3avqwl,Enchanted_Bunny,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"I lived on the border of Kentwood and GR for 5 years.  For one, Kentwood is what I like to call a ""big box suburb."" It's a big series of grids with houses, apartments, chain stores, and a few factories. That's it. There is no ""downtown Kentwood"" you can stroll through very easily. There is no single place you can point to and define as ""Kentwood."" There's no personality whatsoever.  Secondly, crime seems to be on the rise. Personally I think this is due largely in part to the gentrification of Eastown, Midtown, and Heritage Hill in the past few decades.   As low-income housing disappeared, the poor were displaced to the Section 8 apartment complexes in Kentwood (and Wyoming to a degree). Kentwood is famous for it's numerous apartment complexes, as its often nicknamed ""Rentwood."" With the poor came the criminal element, unfortunately.  Where I lived, in a five year span I had a bike stolen from my garage, an attempted break-in, and a group of would-be thieves congregating in my yard next to my garage (I know this because after my neighbor chased them off, the police came flying down my street about 10 minutes later looking for them because they had just attempted to break into a house and set off the alarm).   Now, I live in a poorer neighborhood, but have yet to have a problem. My neighbors haven't had an issue in 10 years. Largely in part because there are no low-income apartment complexes nearby, thus the criminal element isn't being spread by gentrification here. Even though the houses here may be a little bit more run-down and older, they are generally owned by the people who live in them, and this plays a huge role in the low crime rate IMO."

grandrapids,3avqwl,Zuccherina,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:26 2015 UTC,I don't think there's an area of Kentwood that is so bad it's dangerous to get lost in. The majority of the criminal element is from the low-income apartment complexes. A few bad elements come out of there and break into homes in the surrounding neighborhoods.

Yeah, the area is sometimes called ""Rentwood"" because there are a lot of rental properties, but there are plenty of fine (if boring, but can't complain about calm, right?) neighborhoods throughout the city."
grandrapids,3avqwl,andpassword,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"Kentwood is deceiving when you drive through it. Yes, the neighborhoods look quiet, but if you look at the crime map online, there's a pretty good amount of crime.   I lived in a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood that bordered Kentwood and Grand Rapids for five years. Within the first two weeks my bike was stolen from my garage. Every summer multiple cop cars would barrell down the street in the middle of the night looking for burglars on a few occassions. Yet, just by driving through you'd never guess. No, it's not bad by any means, but instead of checking the neighborhoods themselves, check out the apartment complexes within walking distance. THAT is what's going to give you an indication of what the crime is like. If you live next to section 8 housing like I did, you're going to have to take extra steps to secure your home."

grandrapids,3avqwl,FF36,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:40:06 2015 UTC,The best part about Kentwood is that it's a quick drive to all the fun things that aren't in Kentwood.
grandrapids,3avqwl,Pnut36,5,Mon Jun 29 18:54:23 2015 UTC,"We were looking at houses a couple years ago.  We found some amazing houses in Kentwood, at what seemed to be uniformly ridiculously low prices.  Every one we looked at was perfect...in a vacuum.   But then we started to look at the neighborhood itself, and historical data.  Everything we could see showed us that Kentwood is basically in a state of transition right now, from affluent 80s/90s bedroom community with a dash of urban sprawl to...lower class neighborhood.   People were basically abandoning really nice houses and crime rates were increasing across the board.  This was only true for places we were looking at, and crime rates are still low compared to the 'bad' neighborhoods.  But then when we compared to Grandville or Rockford or Caledonia we just felt like the house wasn't worth the location.  Bear in mind that this was only in the neighborhoods we looked at, which wasn't all of them.  It was just the places we found houses that we liked.  But the same pattern seemed to be evolving, especially in the north end of town.  Compared to Detroit?  You'd be able to walk the streets with your pockets stuffed full of $100 bills.  But maybe not for long."
grandrapids,3avqwl,FF36,0,Wed Jun 24 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"My wife and I were looking at houses recently and we looked heavily at Kentwood because there are a billion houses for sale and we could get a really nice house for a really low price. Our real estate agent said ""there are a lot of houses for sale because no one is buying them"".  Either you live in a subdivision with a homeowners association (no thank you) or you might as well live in the City of Grand Rapids. When people say Kentwood is boring, they mean there's no downtown, no culture, and no identity to the city other than a huge amount of houses and some strip malls. Really it's the place to go if you're looking for a cheap subdivision."
grandrapids,3avqwl,Patq911,4,Wed Jun 24 13:11:49 2015 UTC,"You will unfortunately find a lot of hate for kentwood. I don't know why really. It does have a couple bad areas but so does Rockford, caledonia, and Byron center...areas that people assume are flawless. Some people even say it's ""rentwood"" and full of rentals but it's no different than anywhere else in my opinion. I've lived here my entire life. Kentwood has some of the lowest taxes for a city its size in the state while providing top notch services. You can go from 60,000$ homes to over 500,000$. There are some gated communities. Parks with splash pads. Schools are good including the impressive facilities of east Kentwood. Kentwood is an L shaped city going from Gaines township up to cascade and Grand Rapids township and dutton to Wyoming and Grand Rapids. There are many stores in the 28th street corridor obviously with many resteraunts. Dave and busters is a good time, not cheap but fun. Movie theater. Economically its been a stable city for the most part without the blight seen in other areas. Definitely not perfect but no place is. If you get bored...the rec center has many different leagues of games, baseball, softball, soccer, dodge ball.....figure it out folks  Edit: also check the library out for fun in the summer, live music, farmers market. My neighborhood park has movie nights in the summer for kids. Yeah it's a horrible place."

It all depends on what people want. Unfortunately here you get down voted for saying one thing is fun to you if someone else doesn't agree. Some people want to be walking distance to night life while others are more family oriented. Some have to be near a ""down town"" while others like having a short drive so they aren't ""in the city"". reddit brings out some characters"

grandrapids,3avqwl,mxtrav,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason for Kentwood hate is that it's only good if you're the type of person who is happy shopping at the same chain stores and eating at the same chain restaurants all the time, and that the only other selling point is that it's not too far away from all the fun things that aren't in Kentwood.  I lived there for five years, and it felt more like a ""this is just where I sleep at night"" kind of existence."
grandrapids,3avqwl,GVSU__Nate,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Can't say that's a reason to hate it. Depends on what you want. If you want to live where you can walk to go to a bar or club then it is not the right place for sure. It does have stores and restaurants but like you said they are chain places to eat. It is a suburb, it's where you go to have a home and not be in an urban setting but close enough that it's right up the road. I'm ten minutes from downtown Grand Rapids and a few minutes from any type of store for any type of need. If I need basic restaurants or pizza they are close by. If I want more it is not even a trip. I like my neighborhood to come home to and enjoy people that take care of their property very well. Low crime neighborhood, kids running around by themselves and playing in the park. My kid wil someday. I enjoy going out myself, like to founders, but that is ten minutes away. Not bad. And I have a nice home with my own bar, entertainment room with the works for having parties. It is wher I come to sleep, but also workout, relax, sit on my huge deck, grill, hang with friends....just like anywhere else.  It's not for everyone, like I said if you want to sleep in a home in a busy city with everything in arms reach so you never have to leave a few square miles than its not for you. If you like quieter settings, more family oriented, and still only a short distance from anything else you want then there you go. I couldn't live in east town like most of the down voters and ""haters of kentwood"" seem to be...but I don't down vote and hate that area, it's just not my style of living. I thought they were more accepting people...."

If you just need a basic cleaning inside and out or a more detailed cleaning they are reasonably priced. They are one of the best car wash chains in the Grand Rapids area. They have locations all over 28th St with one or two others in different locations, but only the Wyoming location has the full service cleaning and detailing."

grandrapids,3au96x,shadypanda,2,Tue Jun 23 15:56:56 2015 UTC,Ya then it sounds like Southland is probably perfect for what you need done. They have a lot of different options. The most basic cleaning inside and out is around $15 and then they have the Super Clean which is $40 and takes 30 minutes because they steam clean your dash and console and do detailed vacuuming.   They are the only car wash I go to and I have had nothing but good experiences with them.
grandrapids,3au96x,shadypanda,2,Tue Jun 23 16:18:35 2015 UTC,Wow only $40?  I thought a lot of car detailing places were $100+

I just gave them a shot on my 70 Chevelle because I like the car wash service so much. Needless to say I won't bring any of my cars there again. Let me add for detailing that is. The car wash service is excellent. Go to a place that specializes in detailing, not car washes who offer detailing. Crystal clean is one of the best I've used or Great Lakes Chemical ( they are pricey though ) I have a personal friend who does detailing on the side. He has a shop in hudsonville if you want his number inbox me. I am obsessed with finding good detailers and have had my fair share of bad experiences."

Remember WorldCom?   increased competition for private ISPs   Exactly why it is almost certain not to happen.  The private ISPs with fiber in the metro [both AT&T and Comcast - yes, you can get fiber from either one, and 1Gbp/s fiber at that] would sue the city.

Strengthening the connectivity of schools and other community anchors or government facilities   Most [every?] school already has fiber.  They get fiber at much reduced rates.  There are all kinds of odd rules and regulations in this area.  For example - to build out fiber for schools at the subsidized rate a corporation much include ONE commercial for-profit entity in the build plan.  This is exactly how my employer first got [modern] fiber (AT&T Opt-E-Man), we 'volunteered' to be the for-profit in the loop.  Fiber is available in nearly all of Grand Rapids [city of] and the majority of the near-metro.  I have fiber sites in Wyoming, 36th St SE, Kalamazoo Ave, and north Monroe.  Installations pending in the region of the airport - but that has more to do with contracts than service availability.  Service availability is much better than many imagine."

Can you point me to some cases I might be able to look at?  The FCC has come out in support municipal broadband, and even overruled the laws in several states which restricted it. Michigan does have limited regulations on the implementation, which of course would have to be considered when and if such a proposal made it to the drafting stages, but I'm not aware of anything within the context of GR which would give dominant ISPs the legal edge in such a case.  I understand the argument that you would not want to waste money in such a litigious venture though.   Most [every?] school already has fiber. They get fiber at much reduced rates.   I don't have the data on that, but I'd like to learn more. It's an argument that is sometimes presented, so I added it."
grandrapids,3ap4to,maxsilver,3,Mon Jun 22 11:45:05 2015 UTC,"I've spent (wasted?) two years trying to setup a fiber broadband provider in Grand Rapids. I have a lot of this information, and met with most of the interested parties at some point during that time.     Most schools already have fiber. They get fiber at much reduced rates.   I don't have the data on that, but I'd like to learn more.   This is 100% true. http://www.merit.edu/    [both AT&T and Comcast - yes, you can get fiber from either one, and 1Gbp/s fiber at that]     While this is loosly, technically true, it's incredibly misleading. Technically, they both ""offer"" 1Gbps fiber, in that, if you pay them thousands of dollars, they will simply build a new fiber line to you. But there isn't much actual fiber at 1Gbps in the city today that's available for new subscribers to use.  AT&T for instance, doesn't offer above 100x100mbps in most of the city. And the cost for that is currently more than $1,200/month. If you want 200x200 service, they ask you to order two lines of 100x100, at $2,400/month. (Call up enterprise sales and ask them -- I have, multiple times, and gotten this answer)    Why gigabit? Why not 100Mbp/s [aka Fast Ethernet]    Your reasons for this are good.  Another good reason, is that the cost difference is trivial. The vast majority of the cost for broadband is labour and supplies building and maintaining fiber lines. The backhaul costs are trivial at scale, so if your running a fiber line to every house, you might as well max out the speeds available on it.    (AT&T and Comcast)  would sue the city.

Roughly a month ago -- When whitemice last claimed that AT&T had the whole city covered with gigabit fiber on reddit, I called up two different AT&T enterprise reps to fact check myself -- asking specifically about Opt-E and ASE  If I remember correctly, your business happens to be right on top of a trunk line, so I don't think you'd have any issues getting fiber. But a number of sites I checked on at 44th street aren't covered (addresses in Kentwood, Grand Rapids, and Wyoming). Same with 28th St. An office in East Hills. An office in EGR. Etc.  I'm not saying there isn't any gigabit fiber in GR -- there obviously is, in a number of areas. But I don't think that can honestly be translated to ""most of GR"". That level of coverage simply isn't present, though you wouldn't know it until you called to order it.  And, even then, it still doesn't really matter, since like all of these ""Internet in GR"" threads, the thread is asking about residential and small business access, and some people are quoting enterprise commercial fiber at $1,000-$3,000/month as a response to that.   I suppose for the folks who live at 616 lofts, AT&T commercial fiber is an option  ;)"
grandrapids,3ap4to,mikemol,2,Mon Jun 22 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"Getting fiber to us was pretty easy, sure. And it'll be pretty easy anywhere GR has conduit. It doesn't matter how close we are to AT&T trunks; the fiber bundle that goes to us isn't tapped off of some existing line, it's home-run through the city conduits (after a side-bore job to connect our building to their box on the curb), back to a glorified patch panel that I think is at Lake & Fulton, and then home-run back to their CO. And that home-run fiber is a bundle of strands, so future growth is easy.   And, even then, it still doesn't really matter, since like all of these ""Internet in GR"" threads, the thread is asking about residential and small business access, and some people are quoting enterprise commercial fiber at $1,000-$3,000/month as a response to that.   Shit ain't free. You get what you pay for. Only way forward is for stuff to get cheaper. There are cheaper technologies than what AT&T and Comcast use that behave more like coax loops than direct fiber lines, but nobody's deployed them in GR yet. And, again, they behave more like coax loops than direct fiber lines. I can't remember the name of the stuff, though."

You have no expectation of privacy in that case. They wouldn't even need a warrant.  2) Whatever technology you install will be obsolete by the time the bonds the city floats for the purpose get paid off.  The best answer I've seen to both of these problems involved the municipality setting up the fiber, but not lighting it. Single-mode fiber doesn't tend to become obsoleted. You upgrade the transceivers on either end, add DWDM, whatever, the fiber strand designs of today will carry stuff that won't be imagined until you and I have turned to dust.  Lighting the fiber becomes the responsibility of non-municipal entities. Those entities take on the costs of switches, routers, CPEs, customer service, etc. You do not want the city paying for a single packet-aware device, because, again, the loan for that device won't mature for thirty years, even though the device itself will need to be upgraded every five years or so..."

Proper uv lighting can be expensive. Getting temperatures balanced can be tricky.    Ultimately you will succeed but they are a much higher maintenance pet  to raise than a kitten or puppy. You will not have intuition of what is ""right treatment"" or ""healthy behavior"" as you would for a puppy.

While the store is owned by the same company that runs the Family Fare stores, but it more or less does its own thing. They have a decent natural/organic selection and I believe they employ a craft beer/wine/liqour specialist. They have a pretty excellent meat/seafoof service case too.  Fresh Thyme is opening a store on the East Side later this year, and  they compete for that Whole Foods type demo. Their ""center store"" (what most grocery stores refer as profit-driving, processed, grocery goods) is all produce. They also do a lot with bulk foods.  For a quick pick-up, you could try Martha's Vineyard. Not a grocery store, but I really like the staff there and they have more local goods and top shelf wine/liqour.   There's also the more high-end DW stores, the Cascade Meijer, and the Downtown Market (if you really want to pay out the ass).  I'm gonna watch this thread develop, because I've been looking for some small stores to check out myself."

We ate food and drank water last time I was there, but Founder beers are strong. While we were walking back to the car, I decided to go a few blocks up further and get a burger from The Cottage to let my system have time to clear a bit more. We saw a girl take a pretty nasty spill on her bike after swerving around the road and generally exhibiting symptoms of too much of a good thing. Seriously, Founders beers are strong. Just know that coming in. You don't want do anything silly.  As for Grand Rapids itself, how long are you staying? Traffic isn't bad, but parking near Founders can be a challenge. You may have to walk a few blocks, there aren't any parking garages nearby and Founders recently ripped out all of their parking for the sake of expanding the building. You can park further away and take an Uber or a taxi or ride The Rapid (our bus system). Don't be afraid to talk to people. I'm not sure where in Chicago you're coming from, but Grand Rapidians are generally friendly and easy to talk to. Especially behind those gates at Founders after we've had one or two!

But Tuscan has a full stock of singles priced from 1.99 and up so if you can find it there, which I was able, it was a good beer. I think only like $2 for a single too."

Comcast has been tapping its fiber-based platform, usually used for businesses customers (Comcast currently offers up to 10 Gbps to business customers via its fiber-based Ethernet service), to deliver Extreme 505, a targeted residential service that offers 505 Mbps down by 100 Mbps upstream in its northeastern systems as well as its South Division and Central Division. Comcast plans to convert its existing Extreme 505 customers to the new 2 Gig service, and will sell it at a price that’s below the rate those customers are currently paying for the 505-Meg service. - See more at: http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/comcast-boots-2-gig-residential-broadband/389383#sthash.qOlUKa4o.dpuf"

Make no mistake, this is a major blow to them.  I happen to think the idea is a good one, and I can't speak to how their company's run.  But everyone seems to be gunning for the company itself...their own drivers, the taxi services they're replacing, and the cities they work in."
grandrapids,3a5jf7,andpassword,6,Wed Jun 17 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"Uber has an issue right now according to some drivers I'm talking to.  They've lowered the rates so much it's hard for the drivers to turn a profit and a lot of them are dropping out.  This creates a problem at rush, where I've seen 4x multipliers because there aren't enough drivers to meet demand.  YMMV.  Uber, as a passenger, is great... so long as you don't have a shitty multiplier."

grandrapids,3a5jf7,i_hate_sidney_crosby,4,Wed Jun 17 14:20:57 2015 UTC,Anyone who has spent any time studying transportation networks knew this was inevitable;  if making money ferrying people around was easy traditional taxi companies would have better service and lower fares.  It isn't like there is any magic to Uber or whatever.   There is also the fact that drivers will slowly wake up to the delayed cost they are accumulating in using their personal vehicle as a taxi - nobody thinks about consuming the utility of something until it starts to run out [as in your car needing repairs or replacement].
grandrapids,3a5jf7,whitemice,2,Wed Jun 17 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"It is like direct sales companies thiugh... as long as Uber keeps an influx of new drivers, they don't really care."

That's when pretty much everyone else is looking for rides, and what causes the surge.  Unless it's a special event (irish on ionia, new years, etc) just wait for it to drop.  I wouldn't accept anything over 2.0x."
grandrapids,3a5jf7,tbnist03,3,Wed Jun 17 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"I have not tried Uber in Grand Rapids, but I've used it all over Chicago (and I think maybe once in Dallas?). It's an excellent service. Some others are complaining about seeing 4x multipliers, but that's not unique to Grand Rapids. Sometimes drivers are limited during peak times (like Friday/Saturday nights), and in the end it's a business capitalizing on heavy business hours.  That said, I personally would never get rid of my car. As others have mentioned, West Michigan (and most of the United States, really) is just too spread-out. You're not going to take an Uber car all the way to the lakeshore for an impromptu beach day. You'd have a hard time getting to Muskegon or Kalamazoo for a business meeting. And if you need to visit family outside the city, suddenly you're in the awkward position of asking to get picked up.  If you really think you can make it without a car, why don't you try Uber for a few weeks before selling your car and see? Those free rides for referrals are all over the place."

grandrapids,3a2ty9,ab0z,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:12:24 2015 UTC,good idea and execution!  Do the boxes/crates have tops/lids?  Offering lids or a version with a hinged top is the only suggestion for change that comes to mind.
grandrapids,3a2ty9,weshawk_11,3,Wed Jun 17 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"We talked about lids extensively, and we finally decided against it. Aesthetically, the crates look amazing open. Plus, the hardware and extra time adds a bit more to the cost. Also, the idea is really tailored to groomsmen, and wedding gifts are more about show than practicality.  However, everything we build is customizable, and we don't even start building a piece until someone places an order... so if they want lids, we can give them lids : )"

That's why we keep our bikes inside avoids any issues"
grandrapids,3a1mt2,packy11,21,Tue Jun 16 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"stolen a couple weeks ago from my backyard in Eastown (not locked up so it was my fault)   Negative.  It is NOT your fault that something got stolen from your property, locked up or not.  Certainly locking it up would discourage someone looking for an easy score, but leave the blame on the criminals who steal.  When honest people take the blame for criminal activity, we all diminish our own humanity and that of people who choose to steal, for whatever reason.  Sorry for the violent philosophical response...I had been arguing this point with a friend of mine for the last couple days."

It's scary to think that a CL post was created yesterday morning and someone had purchased the bike just hours later. You got lucky - it's so easy to miss these kinds of CL posts when they're up for mere hours before the bikes are sold and the CL posts are taken down.   Also, reminder to all: don't just lock your bikes up. Lock them up with good locks. I see so many wire locks that could practically be snipped apart with fingernail clippers. U-locks are a great option, but so are thicker, armored cable locks (like Abus Steel-o-flex). Better yet, keep your bikes inside - they'll wear down less quickly and be much safer in there."
grandrapids,3a1mt2,bitmanic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"Wire, as you say, can be snipped. U-locks can be broken with a scissor jack. So using both a U-lock and a wire/cable/chain lock might be a better option."

And really, there's not much that can stop a dedicated thief from stealing your bike, so even the combination of both locks isn't guaranteed to keep your bike safe.

Anyway, it was my mountainbike I used for winter riding, locked to my porch with a kryptonite cable lock (I know... now). I was supposed to bring it in a couple days before since I only ride when the snow is light, and we had that thaw / refreeze and I slipped on the sidewalk and messed up my back. Couldn't walk for a week, and the bike stayed on my porch. Frustratingly enough, the day after I had my phone alarm go off with a reminder to bring it in.  My GF was working nights, and came home that night and fell asleep on the couch facing our porch. Someone came up later, right infront of the window with the TV / Lights on / GF facing them, cut the lock, and walked down hollister with it. I got up for work, saw the fresh prints in the snow, followed them as far as I could but had to get to the bus for work.  Only incident I've ever had here, except for the constant harassment from the city about odd things (My bike being on my porch for one, having camping style chairs on the porch, my recycling bin being by the road the day after it went by, the neighbors having snow on their sidewalk and me warned to clean it up...

Many stories of proven fraud are out there, even someone claiming to be a Veteran when they never even served. There are plenty of organizations in Grand Rapids that assist the poor/homeless that are accepting donations and providing wonderful opportunities for them. Your dollars are much better spent donating to one of these organizations than handing them over to someone on the street who is likely to spend the money feeding an addiction they cannot control."

This is like 6 years away from happening and that guy is worried about people not having a reason he deems worthy for riding the train? Calm down, man.   I'm wondering if this will be accessible to people with limited means   There are a lot of people who need to go to Detroit and/or Lansing if that ends up being a stop, for various reasons, and also to visit family. I think it's a good idea, but only if it ends up costing less money and time than other methods. I love the NICTD and have used it to go to Chicago many times.

grandrapids,39zl7h,dontgiveadamn,19,Tue Jun 16 01:50:59 2015 UTC,"I commute via bike for many reasons, including the following:    It keeps me moving, which keeps me healthy. Every person that chooses to ride a bike over driving a car makes this city a little healthier, and that can make a positive impact on local/regional insurance costs (let alone personal livelihood). I'm actually saving you a little bit of money by riding my bike. You're welcome. It's quick and cheap. Getting around the city by bike is usually just as quick as driving or taking the bus. The biggest pain point I have with driving in the city is parking - it can take a long time to find a spot, or it can cost a lot to park in a lot. Parking my bike is free and easy, and it opens up that parking spot for someone else to use - including you. You're welcome. It can actually decrease traffic congestion. Your main frustration seems to be that cyclists slow you down. This is true for streets without bike lanes, but GR is working on that. Studies show that every bikes on non-bike lane roads do cause a small amount of congestion, but this congestion is only really worth mentioning when the percent of trips taken by bike are between 5% and 10%. I don't think GR's ridership is even at 1% yet. Furthermore, every bike that uses a road equipped with bike lanes has a positive effect on traffic congestion. As GR adds more bike lanes, commuting by bike will have a much more positive effect on traffic congestion. Again - GR is still working on this, but they always will be, and you will benefit from it. You're welcome.   I will agree with you in that there are cyclists out there that are ""out of control."" This is also true of drivers, but there's a larger truth here: that regardless of vehicle type, some (most?) people will do what's best for them instead of what's best for the greater good. This is not news, but I'm doing what I can to change the cycling culture among the bike riders that I meet.   It's stupid to blast through red lights and disregard law/logic just to get to dinner faster. It's inconsiderate and confusing to all traffic (drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike) to ride around like a jackass. But this goes for drivers, too.  I'm working hard to make this city a healthier, safer, more pleasant, greener, and cheaper place to live - not just for me, but for you, too. I give up 20% of my salary to volunteer at a non-profit that aims to do this, as well. It's financially stupid, but I care more about GR than I do about my personal coffers. I politely ask that you give a little more respect to the cyclists in this city, or at least give up this frustration for your own good. Life's too short to be angry at people on bikes for ""getting in your way,"" after all!"
grandrapids,39zl7h,bitmanic,4,Tue Jun 16 16:25:49 2015 UTC,just as quick as driving or taking the bus   I can get home 20 minutes faster on my bike than taking the bus. Just saying.

You are spot on with the bike lane idea and I have seen more and more pop up around town although some are obsolete because they don't even put a solid white line.  Thanks for the post my paradigm has shifted.
grandrapids,39zl7h,bitmanic,3,Tue Jun 16 16:35:50 2015 UTC,"The bike lane thing drives me nuts sometimes, but the city's doing the best that they can with limited resources. There are a lot of challenging roads where there's just not enough room for bike lanes, and redoing the roads is comically expensive. Until those roads are run down and ready for a complete overhaul, there's not much anyone can do besides put up with and complain about them.    There are also instances where it seems the bike lanes were designed by someone who doesn't ride bikes and therefore doesn't fully grasp the context in which they were installed. But hey - paved roads are a marvel of modern society and I'll take them any way I can get them.   Oh also, thanks for your response, friend. Have a good one!"

grandrapids,39zl7h,whitemice,8,Tue Jun 16 12:59:28 2015 UTC,"Riding on the sidewalk is less safe when crossing over cross roads. The view of the sidewalk to traffic turning on to the main road is not as good and as a driver you're generally not expecting a bicycle to come tearing down the sidewalk in front of you.  I'm not sure about GR, but in some cities it's illegal to ride your bike on the sidewalk for this reason, and a few others."
grandrapids,39zl7h,andr50,5,Tue Jun 16 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"Because on a road movements can be anticipates.  The problem is sidewalks is entering/exiting the road and curb cuts, both have poor visibility and result in unanticipated movements.  On the street there is no way, except in very rare circumstances, a bicycle holds up a car for more than 60 seconds.  Your minute is simply not that important."

I was on the sidewalk, had to cross the street there, went behind a car (red old slugbug), and a truck bolted from across the other side of College and hit me, pushing me about 30 feet before it stopped. No major injuries, bike was trashed.  Second time happened again on Crescent. Was on the sidewalk, and a car rapidly backed up right into me. Ended up with a sprained ankle, needed new rim on my front tire.  I've had my handlebars clipped in the road once (Cherry and Diamond - I was turning onto diamond at the light, and a car actually tried to go around me on the side I was turning into that I had signaled I was turning into), luckily I had pulled my arm back as I was beginning to turn, or they probably would have hit it with their mirror. Pretty sure the metal handlebar caps I have left a pretty long scrape along the side of their SUV."

grandrapids,39zl7h,packy11,4,Tue Jun 16 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Its illegal in downtown GR for a pretty good reason. Biking on sidewalks is incredibly dangerous unless you're traveling at walking speed and paying complete attention to your surroundings. Even then, it's not hard to imagine a small child bursting out of a doorway or a dog jumping out into your way. The predictable nature of road traffic makes a much better environment for fast-moving bike traffic (though good luck convincing those Jimmy Johns bike couriers of this).  I don't think all cycling on the sidewalk should be illegal - just anything above 5mph. Unfortunately, this is incredibly hard to enforce. That's probably why there's a blanket law regarding this in downtown GR."
grandrapids,39zl7h,packy11,-1,Tue Jun 16 23:17:39 2015 UTC,"So only those who solely ride bicycles (and not a car ever) get a say in the matter? Doesn't sound like ""sharing the road"" to me, but maybe my logic is abhorrent as well."

grandrapids,39zl7h,seanhatch_IRL,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"Isn't that why they are there?    In short, and to take just that point:  no.    Sidewalks are primarily for pedestrians.  Bikers can operate under pedestrian rules, but most choose to operate as vehicular traffic because then they don't have to ride on sidewalks, which if you have ever tried it is miserable.  (KA THUD KA THUD KA THUD)    I will not even attempt to excuse bikers who don't obey traffic laws.  They should be ticketed by police just like cars for running stop signs and failure to yield.

grandrapids,39li3i,Blakechi,9,Fri Jun 12 16:15:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think the biggest barrier would be trying to navigate up Michigan and/or Fuller. Those hills are killer, especially since ride-share bike tends to be slower, heavier bikes."

grandrapids,39li3i,Fat_Male,2,Fri Jun 12 20:40:23 2015 UTC,Maybe if they put in one of those bike hill escalators. Plus think of the great sledding when they shut it down due to ice
grandrapids,39li3i,2k1tj,2,Sun Jun 14 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"Monroe is flat.  Market is flat. Division is flat.  And if you need to go up every cyclist knows, and the city bicycle maps will indicate, you use Fountain St.  It isn't that bad, anyone in reasonable shape can ride a bike up Fountain St.  Or you put the bike on the SilverLine and ride it to the top of the hill."

grandrapids,39li3i,whalemanj,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"It is, I think, but not much more.  And it has much less traffic as well as a light at the very top.  Having to stop and resume - on a hill side - on a bicycle is unfun.  If I can get all the way to the top without stopping it is easier.  And if someone feels more comfortable climbing a steep hill on the sidewalks Fountain has few curb cuts and much less pedestrian traffic than Fulton."
grandrapids,39li3i,whitemice,2,Wed Jun 17 14:36:39 2015 UTC,The Chicago bikes were still pretty expensive IMO.
grandrapids,39li3i,MildlyAgitatedBovine,2,Sat Jun 13 01:42:36 2015 UTC,As a tourist they aren't too bad of prices.  24 hour pass for $7 on a sunny day can be quicker and cheaper option than public transit.  Their regular user options are cheaper than parking options.  My SO who lives in Chicago could either pay $50/mo for uncovered parking or $75 a year for an annual bike membership.
grandrapids,39li3i,wheresbicki,2,Sun Jun 21 20:26:48 2015 UTC,$75/yr is great to be able to pick one up and drop one off at any station.  I'd be all over that.

grandrapids,39li3i,2k1tj,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say the cost is $2M, that is just normal MLIVE distortion.  The cost is probably more like $500 - $1M, which would include property acquisition, installation, etc... which just isn't that much in a developed urban space.    The effect would not have to be significant to return an additional $1M in revenues over the life-time of the infrastructure.  In a municipal budget with a growing population and ongoing development even $2M is not that much money.  Any bump in values resulting from a change will pay it back."
grandrapids,39li3i,whitemice,-1,Sat Jun 13 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"I quote, ""Estimated startup cost: $500,000 to $2 million."" And that's in a municipal budget with a growing population and ongoing development where the overall cost could surge well above that significant price. Before we waste that money on bicycles for tourists to ride in a very walk-able city lets solve some bigger issues first. Like all the homeless people just loitering in parks, bad roads, more plows for these winter storms, or a new light rail line rather than the shitty silver line."
grandrapids,39li3i,2k1tj,2,Sat Jun 13 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"As it has been said already, I can really only see this being used by tourists.  Given that assumption, maybe they could have some of the hotels chip in and base the service in their lots."

grandrapids,39irh3,Tretyal,22,Sat Jun 13 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"Lots of B.S. going on in this article.  That some pellets might bounce off car-doors isn't as dangerous as they're making it out to be. The smaller projectiles carry a lot less force after a ricochet than a rifle bullet does. The pellets are certainly more likely to go off in random directions if they bounce off of something, but they're essentially trading a more wild but less deadly deflection for a less wild but much more deadly deflection. They also mention the soft lead of the shotgun rounds, which also causes the shot to lose energy on a ricochet. In practically every regard, a shotgun is the safer option for innocent bystanders.  How often does the GRPD come across someone wearing body armor? Has this even happened once in the last year? The last 5 years?  The state of Michigan bars hunters from hunting with rifles in Kent county and every other county south of the ""rifle line"". Hunting with rifles in southern Michigan is against the law because a rifle bullet can travel incredible distances, miles if the shooter is aiming at something at an upward angle. Rifle bullets are also MUCH more capable of penetrating walls/roofs. A stray shot from an officer with a shotgun might cost a homeowner sitting in his home some new siding. A stray shot from an officer with a rifle might cost that homeowner his life. We don't let hunters in southern Michigan use these weapons because of the risk, and the deer aren't even shooting back at them. An officer in a shootout is going to have a much harder time controlling his shots than a hunter sitting in a blind/treestand.  I dislike the use of ""Assault Rifle"" here though; are they buying a model with 3-round burst or something? Seems unlikely, and if it's just a semi-auto... well, a rifle's a rifle."

A soft point/hollow point 5.56 out of a carbine barrel deflects and fragments at first contact.  It will penetrate significantly less than both hand gun rounds and even shotgun projectiles.     GRPD switching to a rifle platform for their up close and dirty work would actually be much safer for anyone caught in the crossfire.

grandrapids,39gy7u,The_KMAN,-18,Fri Jun 12 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I am not even religious, but I don't understand why reddit gets all in a tizzy whenever legislation is passed that allows religious people to practice their faith without the threat of being sued for religious discrimination.  It is usually misinterpreted as allowing something extreme, like a EMS working denying care to a hurt patient on the basis of religion, which is not, nor will ever be the case.  Religious organizations want the right to hire people who practice their religion? They don't want to be forced to provide birth control, something that is against their faith, to their employees? Oh Nos!  Oh wait. That stuff is perfectly reasonable and hurts no one.  Imagine the government telling a catholic school they can't hire teachers based on religious beliefs. Now imagine a non-religious teacher teaching bible classes. That's how reddit wants things, it seems. Makes tons of sense."
grandrapids,39gy7u,halifyer,9,Fri Jun 12 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's the issue that these organizations are funded by the state government. That immediately complicates the ""private groups can do what they want"" argument. So stripping them of their state funding would be a nice start.  The problem with organizations like this blatantly discriminating against a group of people is that it marginalizes them (more than they already are). Imagine if universities could still ban African Americans like they did only 60 years ago. You could say ""private institutions can do what they want,"" but it undermines the fact that universities (and these adoption organizations today) are institutions that are entrenched and vital in the public interest. Disadvantaging minorities from these institutions is denying them a service that's aimed at the greater good of society. You could say ""everyone is on a level playing field, and if there's a desire for tolerant adoption agencies they are free to organize themselves,"" but that's ignoring the real-world lack of resources and the ingrained bureaucracies surrounding the current adoption organization climate.   And thirdly, I think people are just disgusted that this kind of religious belief even exists at all. It's just super dumb and hateful and shouldn't be respected as valid religious beliefs. Your example of a catholic school hiring a catholic teacher makes sense because the purpose and mission of that organization is to provide a catholic education. You could say that a catholic teacher is significantly best qualified to teach a catholic class. But the function of an adoption agency is to provide a public humanitarian service to children in need. The logic for their mission would have to be that a heterosexual couple is significantly best qualified to raise a family, which is not accurate. It's just a way for them to make a statement that gays are icky and can't provide a loving, supportive family."
grandrapids,39gy7u,bradtgrace,2,Fri Jun 12 20:52:19 2015 UTC,Well said.
grandrapids,39gy7u,a_lilac_mess,-11,Thu Jun 11 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with organizations like this blatantly discriminating against a group of people   Except that no law was passed that allows religious organizations to ""blatantly discriminate"". Your entire second paragraph is moot, as it does not apply to the laws in question. Just like I stated in my previous post, people need to go to unrealistic extremes in order to try to justify their stance. If you actually believe what you are typing, you need to go read the text of the bill itself, and stop getting your info from biased sources.  The way it typically works is: religious organizations must appeal to the state supreme court for any case in which they are charged with religious discrimination. They must then convince a judge to give them an exception. No judge is going to allow discrimination with no reasonable explanation to back it up. ""My religion hates black people"" will not cut it. But reddit thinks it will. As if it will provide some huge loophole in the law to allow any form of hateful discrimination.  Here is something for you to check on. The ""michigan religious freedom act"" that was passed months ago that got /r/Michigan all riled up... It was actually federal law since the 90's I believe. So when it was federal law and applied to all 50 states, can you find me one single case where an exception was granted that you find deplorable and unreasonable?   But the function of an adoption agency is to provide a public humanitarian service to children in need.   Cultivation and counseling of families, and generally providing family-based services, is inherent in all religions. It is a core service they provide. To deny their ability to provide family services such as adoption, in the way they see religiously fit, is to deny their right to practice their religion. They are not hurting anyone. Just as with non-religious schools, there are non-religious adoption agencies available as well."

grandrapids,39gy7u,wilsonw,-3,Fri Jun 12 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"I'm supporting the right to practice religion without the government forcing your hand to do something against your faith, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Which is the case here as I see it. To me, it's a noble cause.  In the mean time, if you have some specific counter points to make, I am very willing to consider opposing arguments and change my opinion. So far, the only counter points i hear boil down to eroding the right to freedom of religion, a fundamental pillar of our society. That's not acceptable to me.  Yes there needs to be limits to practicing religion. You can't harm others while doing so. Beyond that, please tell me what's so terrible about it?"
grandrapids,39gy7u,halifyer,4,Thu Jun 11 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"It's that the government is essentially sanctioning discrimination. The government is giving these agencies funds to run their business. If their business is denying service over a religious disagreement, then they are effectively denying it themselves. And now there's no legal grounds to protest this. This is a piece of legislation that doesn't help a single person. Why is it receiving priority over the many other issues our state faces?"
grandrapids,39gy7u,wilsonw,-3,Fri Jun 12 11:00:05 2015 UTC,"Okay so, I really haven't taken a side on the government funding aspect of this argument. I'll agree that there could be a conflict or concern.  Keep in mind that I am not religious or anti-gay. So these are my tax dollars going to these agencies. Initially, it doesn't bother me a whole lot. I mean, should we pull their funding just because they are exercising their rights? Without government funding I assume they would have to shut down. So cutting funding would eliminate eliminate adoption options for the religious. It doesn't strike me as fair. One might go as far as to say it is discrimination against religion. So which is better?  To me, if we are going to protect the freedom of religion, you need to take the good with the bad, and expect that over time society will grow and mature, and religion will change to compliment society. I don't think it is wise to use government as a tool to force people's hands in these kinds of scenarios. The government should protect freedoms."
grandrapids,39gy7u,halifyer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's also the tax dollars of those who are being discriminated against."

grandrapids,39gy7u,PorkShake,2,Thu Jun 11 21:30:49 2015 UTC,The problem most see with this law is that it allows organizations to discriminate but also continue to accept tax funded subsidies.  Similar debate occurred up until the mid 1990's related to interracial adoption.  At that point a law was passed not banning discrimination in adoption but removing tax funding for organizations that refuse to place children in mixed race homes.  It probably had similar controversy at that time but now seems common sense.    I think why people on reddit and other forums seem so vocal is that in 20-30 years we want to tell our children we stood up for rights and equality and didn't remain silent like so many did during civil rights reforms.

Okay, I'm not so sure that qualifies as harmful, but for the sake of argument, let's say it does. Is the pharmacist working for a religious organization and conducting his job within the guidelines given to him by his employer? If so, then the law provides an avenue of defense on the basis of religious practice should the organization ever get sued for not making those available. That organization will have to make a case to the state supreme court and a judge will decide if it is within their right to religious freedom, or if it went beyond a reasonable limitation. That is what the law allows. It doesn't grant exceptions automatically. All cases are evaluated on an individual basis.  Or is the pharmacist taking a personal stance and not working for a religious organization? If so, the organization he works for can get sued and can not claim a religious exception for the law. Er go, the organization will lose the suite and he will get fired."

grandrapids,39bp9g,blackfacehobbyist,10,Thu Jun 11 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"""Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has expressed concerns the legislation could lead to lawsuits.""  Could? Understatement of the year. ""Will lead to lawsuits"" wouldn't be much of a stretch. This is honestly sickening."
grandrapids,39bp9g,PattyOLantern,2,Wed Jun 10 19:08:56 2015 UTC,As if Snyder gives a shit about any of us anyways.
grandrapids,39bp9g,Adonn_John,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"Why single out Snyder? Are you implying that other politicians do care? If so, which ones?  Also, I could give a shit of a politician truly cares about me on a personal level. Instead, I'd rather they put their energy into enacting policies that help generate economic growth in a state that blindly hitched its wagon to short-sighted corporations that couldn't (and still cannot) ensure their own long-term solvency.  Edit: 15 minutes after posting this and I'm already getting downvoted. I'm sorry for crushing anyone's fantastical beliefs, but if anybody is delusional enough to think that a politician in our government truly cares about the people enough to put their needs over his, I've got some magic beans to sell you."
grandrapids,39bp9g,PattyOLantern,4,Thu Jun 11 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.  I'm perhaps more conservative than many of you on this sub, both fiscally and morally.  That said, those who are pushing for this kind of legislation, I would wager, are also pro-life, no?  I would make the argument that it seems a bit silly to be turning people away from an agency that very desperately needs to be seen as a viable go-to for an alternative for abortion.  If the number of available families willing to adopt go down (and it's already quite low), this will only drive that number lower.  It's all about priorities, and it seems this should be pretty low on that list."
grandrapids,39bp9g,Kisaoda,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:23:51 2015 UTC,Oh boy.   Well... at least we're leading the charge on making the Supreme Court rule on stuff?  I dunno.  Trying to find a positive here.  Coming up empty.
grandrapids,39bp9g,simjanes2k,-9,Thu Jun 11 09:03:14 2015 UTC,Victory for the good guys.

grandrapids,39cktc,maplemuppet,4,Wed Jun 10 21:19:10 2015 UTC,Millenium park is nice. They have a nice park and splash pad too. You have to pay to get in. I don't remember how much. It's in Walker.
grandrapids,39cktc,Stellabluebell,2,Wed Jun 10 22:40:14 2015 UTC,For adults it's only $4
grandrapids,39cktc,JSK23,3,Wed Jun 10 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the beach you were told about in Rockford is at Myers Lake, on Myers Lake road between 11 mile and 12 mile roads. There is a nice public beach, playground, shade, and picnic tables, and it's free to get in."

grandrapids,39cktc,Dizzy_deer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"Don't know of any in Rockford, unless they were talking about versluis park. It's right at the border between Rockford and Plainfield township. It's nice there, cheap too. Clean, sandy, designed more for kids more than adults, since it doesn't get too deep from what I remember. Never had any issues with it, except parking fills up fast. My sister was there yesterday with her kids, and they had fun. It's got a big playground and grills and stuff.   I'm sure there are more places, but I can't think of any outside of private homes alongside lakes."
grandrapids,39cktc,Wyietsayon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:39:45 2015 UTC,It gets very deep.  It is the old gravel pit.

grandrapids,39cktc,drew2525,2,Wed Jun 10 23:07:21 2015 UTC,I really like the little grassy park off lake dr but it doesn't seem like people want to swim right there. Is there anywhere to that's more?  Edit: .. inviting?
grandrapids,39cktc,i_hate_sidney_crosby,2,Thu Jun 11 03:45:55 2015 UTC,Swimming is prohibited from the public areas. They take it pretty seriously.
grandrapids,39c1u1,sassysaucer,5,Wed Jun 10 19:21:44 2015 UTC,These other two comments must have Eastern and Diamond confused. Looked like Diamond was being resurfaced when I drove by last time.   My theory is that they are taking up all the roads and will hang us all out to dry when they say they don't have the budget to finish them.
grandrapids,39c1u1,gnomes616,2,Wed Jun 10 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you and I are on the same page. Finally found some info, buried on the city's website. They're resurfacing Crescent to Michigan. Hopefully it doesn't take too long, although, it is nice and quiet over here without all that traffic."

grandrapids,39col5,GVSU__Nate,4,Wed Jun 10 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"The press site has a underground water vein running under it. They need all the support they can get if they're going to add any height.  That water vein use to feed a fountain in the little pocket park next to van andel cancer. It runs under that park still, cuts under Michigan, under the press and Rowe hotel then empties into the river."
grandrapids,39col5,pukingfratbro,2,Thu Jun 11 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought at first as well. But if they build it like they did the med school, ie. parking then the office space. They can put any utilities technically above ground but with in the parking super structure. I know the architecture firm that did the med school is doing this one as well."
grandrapids,39col5,pauliep84,-2,Wed Jun 10 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ahhh that makes sense...but you'd think they'd still want to anchor it in the ground somehow for stability purposes.   Also, because they just filled this massive hole in, it's definitely going to ""settle"" a bit and that could lead to future problems..."
grandrapids,39col5,andpassword,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:37:33 2015 UTC,They'll anchor it by driving pilings down to bedrock.  They did that under the parking structures too.  Hooray banging sound all day long for a few weeks.

grandrapids,39731f,mrpotaytahead,17,Tue Jun 9 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"They have the best sandwiches in GR in my opinion.  However, Wednesday night will be busy (mug club night -- though every night at founders is pretty busy); you order and pick up at a window at night (similar to Bell's); and nobody goes to founders for their service.    Go to an actual restaurant for your anniversary."
grandrapids,39731f,mitten_mike,6,Tue Jun 9 21:22:10 2015 UTC,The Devil Dancer sandwich is still the spicy hottest thing I have ordered anywhere in GR. Damn good.
grandrapids,39731f,ntgv,0,Tue Jun 9 19:00:38 2015 UTC,They have the best sandwiches in GR in my opinion.   Cherry Deli / Two Beards imo
grandrapids,39731f,claimed4all,11,Wed Jun 10 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent sandwiches, no table service. Minors may not be able to enter after 6 or so, depending on the night."
grandrapids,39731f,dino_explosion,5,Wed Jun 10 07:12:35 2015 UTC,They do have table service there at lunch. Runs till about 3.
grandrapids,39731f,SnappleBack,3,Tue Jun 9 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Even if you do arrive before the cut off time, they will come to your table and ask you to leave at that time (Happened to me several years ago). I wouldn't recommend them for dinner time if she's not 21."
grandrapids,39731f,thealphateam,2,Tue Jun 9 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, good to know"
grandrapids,39731f,burt_macklin_fbi,8,Tue Jun 9 19:10:30 2015 UTC,They're food is not great in my opinion. I know a lot of people who love it. And then there is me - too much bread and not enough actual food there.
grandrapids,39731f,Rodeopants,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While tasty, way too much bread.   The French bread pizza is pretty good though"
grandrapids,39731f,jbraids1421,6,Tue Jun 9 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind getting a bit spendy,  San Chez is great for a nice,  romantic date. Great variety,  and some fun NA drinks so your lady can feel like she's part of the fun there,  too.   If that's a little much for you,  I'd recommend on the next tier down City Sen (inside the City Flats Hotel), or Bull's Head. Both are nice intimate spots with great outdoor seating, good for people watching.   If you're looking for something a little bit more casual (and busy), Stella's Lounge has some mean ass burgers and tasty drinks,  although I'm not sure how much fun the girlfriend would have there, unless she digs arcade games. The Cottage Bar is also a classic."

grandrapids,39731f,rawrimallyssa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:53:16 2015 UTC,When was this? I go there 3-4 times a month and have brought plenty of people under 21. They've always said you need to be 21 after 9

grandrapids,39731f,jevchance,2,Wed Jun 10 02:34:20 2015 UTC,It's noisy. The crowd tends to be middle-aged folks the few times I've been there. Mid-quality bar dishes.
grandrapids,39731f,CYBORGMEXICAN,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:29:30 2015 UTC,"I've had every sandwich and all apps, not at the same time of course. Never disappointed.

grandrapids,39731f,moogoo2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:03:44 2015 UTC,Good but not great sandwiches. Could never see myself going specifically for the food.

grandrapids,397ady,49503,2,Tue Jun 9 19:42:10 2015 UTC,$100. I heard it on the news this morning.
grandrapids,397ady,PattyOLantern,3,Tue Jun 9 19:52:50 2015 UTC,WTF with the site music?  That's like a throwback to MySpace.  Turning off the speakers so I can try again.
grandrapids,397ady,andpassword,4,Tue Jun 9 20:16:07 2015 UTC,Events like this should be a suggested donation. Having a $100 price tag means they're only targeting the wealthy.
grandrapids,397ady,wilsonw,-1,Tue Jun 9 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"Not really.   Your average young professional (a large portion of Grand Rapids residents) can easily fork over $100 here and there for a cause they care about.   If they wanted to target the wealthy, it would be a $10,000+ ticket"
grandrapids,397ady,GVSU__Nate,8,Tue Jun 9 23:40:22 2015 UTC,Disagree. $200 is a lot for a couple to fork over. Especially for an event like this.
grandrapids,397ady,wilsonw,8,Wed Jun 10 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think your ""average young professional"" is still struggling with student loans despite landing their first real job after college. You're describing someone with disposable income, and probably no kids yet. That's not average, that's privileged."
grandrapids,397ady,bradtgrace,-2,Wed Jun 10 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"I have several friends who are, ""Young Professionals"", as well as several friends who work shitty retail/customer service jobs. I can't think of a single one of them who couldn't come up with $100 if they really wanted to.   You're describing someone with disposable income, and probably no kids yet. That's not average, that's privileged.   Not having kids is ""privileged""? I'm sorry your kids are keeping you down, maybe you should have thought about that before you pumped one out?"
grandrapids,397ady,KorrectingYou,2,Wed Jun 10 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"I AM a young professional, with no student loans and no kids. For what it's worth. I work at a large company with over 100 other young professionals just here in GR. I can think of plenty (maybe most?) people who wouldn't spend $100 (each person) on a single event like this.  So maybe I shouldn't have used the word ""privileged,"" seeing as how you may think I meant it in the SJW Tumblr ""white male privilege"" way. I meant it in the ""offering opportunities"" way. It's not the average, it's the segment that has the benefit of not having loans and kids.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with wilsonw's claim of it being strictly for the wealthy, but it's definitely not something an average joe would attend on a whim, which was the whole point of this thread."

Not sure if maybe you could track down an older one that is being sold and go take a look at it to see how well it has held up?"
grandrapids,38y9yr,freehunter,3,Mon Jun 8 01:21:46 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you go, or what your budget is, or your desire for an HOA or not, there are a bunch of local builders I would choose before jumping into an Allen Edwin community."
grandrapids,38y9yr,andpassword,4,Mon Jun 8 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"So I just bought one.  I havent lived in it yet but from what I can gather the build quality starting out as a building company was kind of garbage (take it with a grain of salt my realtor said this, the house I bought looked and seemed really nice for the value).  You're going to have some bad points and good points to a mass produced home like this but my initial impressions was well enough to want to purchase one.  I went into the purchase knowing that I may have a few issues here or there but any house comes with its headaches.  The neighborhood I'm going to move to has many of these homes and they're all standing and look to be in very good shape still.  Which I could give you more feedback but that's a ways off I'm afraid.  I think its much better than an arrested development house (the stigma those built houses get)."
grandrapids,38y9yr,Mayway,2,Mon Jun 8 00:03:40 2015 UTC,I almost went for one but instead picked an Eastbrook home -- much more pleased than I would have been had I gone for Allen Edwin.
grandrapids,38y9yr,fst47,-3,Tue Jun 9 10:45:22 2015 UTC,I would never purchase one. They're extremely cheaply-built and seem to have tons of ongoing quality issues.   They're the Comcast of home builders.

It was almost impossible to keep there tank clean and it smelled all of the time. Any time you ""handle"" a turtle you must wash your hands well, because of a chance of bacteria. I had them for 8 years and finally decided to get rid of them. I don't miss them, I don't think about them. Yes they were cute when they were little but, they never die! And there stinky and gross.... Just my opinion. Anyway I got mine at the mall in Kalamazoo and my mom bought the other at Anne's pet shoppe in Greenville."

grandrapids,38p9gs,kzoolander,-2,Sat Jun 6 17:42:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it's got enough value to get a billboard put up, so I'll have to question your assessment there.  Calling it a non-issue unworthy of discussion, just because you really think it ought to be, is a great way to get a rude wake-up call from your blind spot when it turns out not everyone else the same way (and they vote!). Wishing in one hand doesn't stop them shitting in the other. It's not over 'till it's over, and it doesn't look very over, given the fact that there's still a billboard over there and a significant objection over here."
grandrapids,38p9gs,SuperFLEB,3,Sat Jun 6 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"Well, it's got enough value to get a billboard put up   I can put up a billboard that says my shit tastes like triple mocha fudge, but it's not based in fact, and no reasonable person would debate it with me.  The way to invalidate these lunatic notions is not to engage them, because challenging them does no good.  Those kinds of people will believe what they want to anyway. You invalide those opinions by not engaging, treating them as they are:  rantings from crazy people who think their shit tastes like chocolate.  ETA: ""I don't care what the facts are or about right nd wrong, I believe what I believe and my beliefs should be respected because you want people to respect yours"" is an argument that's used to justify the continuation of way too many horrible things.  It elevates bullshit opinions to the same status as reasoned opinions based in facts, and that has to stop."

The difference is that the Dieseltec jackass was not putting billboards up in public, and wasn't in the face of anyone who didn't approach them (before the whole thing blew up, I mean). This is more public, and is a direct statement (rather than an objectionable way of conducting business), and as such, some may wish to rebut in kind, or some may think it reflects poorly on the community and wish to have a visible counter-argument to counteract that.   Stop giving them coverage all over local news and masking good things happening in the community.    Ironically, the sensationalism of the death throes are what make this sort of thing interesting, and what pretty well means it's going to keep coming up on the news. I mean-- yeah, I'd love it if the news was more substance and less fluff, but I'd sooner wish for a unicorn that coughs up hundred-dollar bills."

I may or may not consider you a lunatic for any variety of positions, and I expect you to give exactly as many fucks about that as I give about you: zero.

Atheists put up signs saying ""God does not exist"", and you dont see such a whiny meltdown from Christians screaming about ""hate"" and ""oppression""."
grandrapids,38p9gs,VanNassu,13,Fri Jun 5 22:30:08 2015 UTC,uhhhhhhh....yeah you do
grandrapids,38p9gs,grand_rapidian,-18,Fri Jun 5 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm going ask again, because  obviously you people are such intellectually bankrupt cowards, that you cant answer shit, and instead just rush to bury comments.  Exactly what was the ""hate""???????  That they think that gay is a behavior? Ooooooh, how dare they question this!  Atheists put up signs saying ""God does not exist"", and you dont see such a whiny meltdown from Christians screaming about ""hate"" and ""oppression""."

grandrapids,38p9gs,LuckyASN,2,Sat Jun 6 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"You've got a point that ""hate"" may be a bit strong of a sentiment to immediately attribute to that. While I wouldn't be surprised if the people responsible did hold hate for homosexuals, it could be just as likely that they consider themselves obligated to their religious duties regardless of their own feelings, trying to help by steering our State away from the ire of an angry God, or disturbed by seeing their traditions corroded by attempts at reinterpretation. There are more than one path that would lead one to this bit of advocacy. So, yes, I'd agree that ""hate"" is probably the wrong word to apply, without knowing the specific motives of the people involved. (And as one who really hates overblown frothing like that-- everything is terrorism !!!-- it's actually starting to itch on me a bit, too.)  As far as behavior versus nature, I'm not sure where the science lies currently on that (and I don't need to be schooled by everyone, TYVM-- I'll get to why I don't care), but biology aside, the whole thing is a rather meaningless diversion, a bit of red-herring that eliminates itself when you reduce down the equation.  The reason why gay people prefer the same sex is largely irrelevant to the question of whether or not they should have the right to partner. While ""You weren't born this way"" might be an interesting factoid or a useful taunt (given the aims of the organization, it certainly smells more the latter), it's got little bearing on the legitimacy of the proposed civil right. There are plenty of things which might be nature or behavior-- fat versus thin, football versus chess club, religious versus atheist, confrontational versus accommodating, Reddit versus going outside. But equal access and civil liberties don't need to rest on justifications or motivations, they just exist. And in the absence of significant demonstrable harm to an innocent, freedom should be the default. Lady Liberty says to mind your own business and stop asking so many questions.  You mentioned ""oppression"", albeit in a similar example. That word would certainly apply to this action. The billboard seeks to convince others that ""Homosexuality is not a civil right"". While that statement may be true at the moment (thanks, Prop. 2), it's true of an oppressive condition, and given that they're pushing to keep that status quo, they are actively pressing to continue oppression.  So, in the interest of TL;DR...   While ""oppression"" was evident in the billboard, outright ""hate"" looks to be a stretch without assigning motives. Fair point. ""Homosexuality is a behavior"" has nothing to do with ""not a civil right"". Billboard parse error on line 1."

But before you say I gotchya I want to ask you a question. Have you not seen this belief mission (homosexuality is a behavior) perpetuate hate in individuals?   'Course if you are unaware of how fervently Christian groups protest billboards of atheistic thought, I'm willing to bet you're not going to answer my question with honesty.  Anyway I can't wait until this debate dies off. It's only a matter of time."
grandrapids,38p9gs,madidah,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:03:22 2015 UTC,'rushing to bury' isn't what's going on here. you have an incredibly unpopular opinion and MOST people here disagree with you.

grandrapids,38nziv,bradtgrace,2,Fri Jun 5 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"As an early GRFC supporter, I really wish I could make it tonight! Unfortunately I have plans at the art festival...  Thanks for the awesome write-up though. I especially like the blurb about tonight's opponent. Great way to set up some context for the match.  Do you know if our membership scarves get us into the game for free? I know there was talk about that awhile ago, but that was long before we had to be postponed."
grandrapids,38nziv,kzoolander,2,Fri Jun 5 17:11:29 2015 UTC,Members were able to pick up membership cards (or you could request to have them mailed to you) that allow you access in for free. If you don't have one I would email Matt Roberts grandrapidsfc@gmail.com and he should be able to get you one.
