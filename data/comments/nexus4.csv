nexus4,3e4sw3,tristanSchorn,9,Tue Jul 21 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"No, its not. Just because some Android M libraries were pushed for the Nexus 4 doesn't mean this phone is getting the update. Can it handle it? Sure. So can the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S. And many non-nexus devices like the Galaxy S2. Doesn't mean they're officially getting it. It'll be dev-supported but not officially."
nexus4,3e4sw3,Guardian_452,0,Wed Jul 22 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"The Galaxy Nexus had the well documented Texas Instruments departure from chip making.  The Nexus S is almost 5 years old, which is arguably an acceptable time frame to drop support for a device.  Of course both could easily run M, and I expect both have unofficial ports. But they both have other reasons why offical support was dropped. The Nexus 4 is capable, is running a very similar chip to the Nexus 6, and isn't all that old."
nexus4,3e4sw3,Guardian_452,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"Google is without an excuse on the Galaxy Nexus. There are a ton of Kitkat Roms and a few lollipop Roms too. The TI hardware wasn't an issue for some devs to develop for on their free time. How come a couple rom hobbiests were able to do in their spare time what Google apparently couldn't do despite it being their full time job?  The arguments for porting M to the Nexus 4 mainly revolve around it ""having good enough hardware"" and ""still being usable by 2015 standards, despite it being from 2012."" Same arguments I'm using to say the Nexus S should get the update. It's still relevant enough.  One could argue that the iPhone 4S is on year 4 and is getting all the iOS 9 updates. But Google has never waved their standards to compete with Apple's. They're by the model of setting their own standards."

I don't feel like Google is at fault for not supporting closed source hardware with what would be essentially reverse engineering. Any bugs Google encountered would have to be worked around essentially blindfolded.   The arguments for porting M to the Nexus 4 mainly revolve around it ""having good enough hardware"" and ""still being usable by 2015 standards, despite it being from 2012.""    That's only one point, and it's only one of the five points I made.   But Google has never waved their standards to compete with Apple's.   Google has waved their standards once already. When Lollipop was launched for the Nexus 4, the Nexus 4 was already out of the current 18 month support guarantee policy Google had at the time."
nexus4,3e4sw3,ScottyNuttz,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:25:20 2015 UTC,You just want to see a pattern that Google will continue to update despite being out of the 18 month support policy just because it happened once. Anomaly =/= new trend

The Nexus 4 is a niche phone with a shrinking user base due to failing batteries, cracked screens and other problems that arise naturally as a phone ages. Google has been providing up-to-date versions of Android for as long as this was easily done. Side note: As phones are getting more powerful, we'll eventually come to a point where it is not worthwile to update aging devices to the next version of the OS because doing so would impact their performance so gravely that they become almost unusable."

Do you mean because the Nexus phones used to be developer phones? They have long moved into a more mainstream position, with lots of advertising.   failing batteries   I'm of the opinion that most Nexus 4 batteries are almost certainly still in good condition, and any damaged batteries were likely due to manufacturing defects or environmental stress. Modern Lithium Ion cells, like in the Nexus 4, should last years. You can check this in the battery info on your device.   As phones are getting more powerful, we'll eventually come to a point where it is not worthwile to update aging devices to the next version of the OS because doing so would impact their performance so gravely that they become almost unusable.

That'll help with the Google Services and Phone taking that much battery, but watch for any other app once you turn off location.

Again this isn't super sick phone. Its a pretty good phone for dirt cheap that looks like a bigger n4 in my humble opinion. It was my first thought when I opened it up and so I shared it.

A restart fixes it and makes things run fast again. But I have GO Launcher and it has a little RAM boosting/clearing app included in the app drawer screen (icon is a brush at the very bottom of the screen). This quicker than having to restart every time the phone gets laggy. Hope this helps!  P.S. I think I also cleared cache by booting in recovery mode a few weeks ago. I did something in recovery mode for sure. This was following advice in a thread on this subreddit not too long ago.

nexus4,3diegw,unerds,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"the only thing i could suggest otherwise would be to reflash the entire factory image.  since (unless i'm mistaken) factory reset from recovery doesn't really effect the radio firmware at all, and more or less just clears out your apps/data/settings, it's not surprising that you've had no luck in improving the scenario.  you could try to flash ONLY the radio firmware from the above archives, but ensure that you'd be extracting it from the exact same version which you are currently running.  i couldn't say for certain if this is a safe process though, having never had cause to attempt it myself.  your safest bet would be to follow the entire instruction set, and flash the whole image which resets the bootloader, recovery, radio and ROM (i think) to factory conditions.  if that doesn't work, then you likely have a hardware issue, which would likely require you to warm up the soldering iron ;)   just be sure to back up everything before going down this road."
nexus4,3diegw,Hoobacious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:09:46 2015 UTC,When I upgraded from 5.0.2 to 5.1 and 5.1.2 I used WugFresh Nexus Root Toolkit and flashed using factory images which should overwrite the existing radio.

Anyway, by pulling the bass up you're inevitably ""reducing"" the volume of the rest of the frequencies, especially if you're too aggressive with the eq. You can just bring up the bass 5db and leave mids and highs and expect it to sound good.   Eq is useful to aid the way your headphones sound, assuming they are lacking a bit in that area. Unless you're using high grade headphones, I doubt your bass needs boosting as most consumer headphones are already way too bassy. Please don't tell me you're using beats by Dre lol.   If you're sure you're using the eq appropriately and it's a software problem, I don't know what to say. Mine works, though admittedly I never use eq as my headphones are fine on their own.

nexus4,3d8bas,arithmetic,5,Tue Jul 14 08:05:26 2015 UTC,A few months ago (when running 5.0) I was having those problems. I flashed the factory image and did a factory reset. I also did not allow it to restore apps and I cut the apps that had accumulated on my phone to bare minimal. That mostly fixed it (occasionally the problem will return for a day or two--mostly after using the YouTube app in my case). Since then I've slowly re-added apps. Occasionally the problem will resurface and uninstalling a recently added app will make the problem go away.  FWIW later my SO was able to improve things on her Nexus 4 by just pruning apps and wiping cache.

That being said, the biggest challenge is separating the LCD and Digitizer in the first place, it is tricky. Also if you get a black light lightbulb you can use that to cure the UV glue (or even going outside on a sunny day). I would suggest using the UV glue being that it is pretty simple to spread on and cure. Without it there really is an annoying glare and forget using it outside for the next couple of weeks/months."

LG G2 can be had for around $150-189 USD  (search Slickdeals for pointer threads) and is basically a better version of the Nexus 5.  Alternative would be the Moto G which is the best bang for your buck at around $100ish.

If you're loathing for that stock Android feeling CM is also in development and with the bootloader unlock and TWRP it will be an easy upgrade! There is also a ROM that removes all the bloatware if that is a deal breaker for you and overall I would recommend it for anyone looking for a cheap phone under $450 CAD.

I'm running 5.1 stock, rooted.  My nexus is nearly 2 years old, I got it when they dropped the price.    So today my phone came off the charger at around 4:00am.  This afternoon I put it on the charger for about 20 mins, which added nearly 10% to my battery level.  Right now, at 11:30 pm I'm on 31%, so I've been off the charger for about 19.5.  If it wasn't for that 20 mins charge I'd say I'd have about 20% charge left, after 19h of time off the charger.  My current screen on time is 2h 37m.  So yeah, I'm not a heavy user but I have no problem getting through a day.  When I upgraded from 4.4.4 to 5.1 I did notice that my standby time when the phone was idle dropped a bit, but my screen on time was greater - in other words, idle power use wasn't as good as 4.4.4, but ""active"" power use was better.

nexus4,3cl3f9,rusder,2,Thu Jul 9 00:12:39 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, it'd be tough as the prox sensor is user space and double tap to wake is kernel space. You'd have to write a utility to monitor the sensor, give it root privileges, and have it set a sysfs entry that dt2w would monitor. This would stop deep sleep as well, so battery life would be reduced.   What you could try is the Mirage kernel: the dev has implemented a dt2w similar to the LG G2, where you can tap twice anywhere on the screen, but in a very precise small area. It works great for me with hardly any accidental wake. It also has the feature where you can temporarily switch off the dt2w by using the power key. You need a ROM or an app to switch the screen off; I use Cataclysm with swipe navbar to sleep, for example.   I've made an anykernel package with dt2w enabled by default if you would like an easy setup.   Edit: I just now noticed you're running KitKat. I don't know if LP kernel will work on KK. Try using Gravity Screen and see if that works for you."

When the temperature is either too cold or too humid, no contact is made between the power button and the board - so the screen doesn't turn on when the phone goes to sleep.

The microphone and charging port are on the same ribbon, so I assume there's a short. I've purchased a replacement but haven't put it in yet because I'm at the point where I think it's time to upgrade to something newer."

A horizontal strip about 1 cm tall just under the notification bar doesn't respond to touch.  The fix is to replace the digitizer, which would entail replacing the screen.  Whether that's worth it, I'm not sure. The part should be fairly cheap from Amazon or eBay, but the repair itself seems like a pain.  Edit: Looks like the screen is not as cheap as I thought. I must have been looking at the wrong part on Amazon."

nexus4,3bglzs,rawrberry,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:45:54 2015 UTC,"Buy the whole screen assembly, not just the LCD glass. Then you don't need to worry about adhesives and it's just a few screws. I'm in Canada and I can get them for $70 (~$55 USD) each, shipped locally."

nexus4,3bf25u,shamootang,3,Sun Jun 28 17:19:36 2015 UTC,Optimizing is typical if you flash a custom rom and wipe your cache. Also happens if you're using a mod like xposed and it makes some changes.
nexus4,3bf25u,jochoki,2,Sun Jun 28 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"How long since you last wiped and start over? I found that many troubles went away when I did that.   I'm rooted so I use Titanium Backup to ensure I have a backup of everything first. Copy that off the phone. Then download the stock ROM and run the installer script. The script includes a -w switch which means ""wipe"" - important to leave that active. Then re-root, install Titanium again, copy the backup to the phone, and restore only the needed buts and pieces back to the phone."
nexus4,3bf25u,FinibusBonorum,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what worked for me. I used to have OP's problem fairly often - about 50-80% of the time I had to turn on my phone.

nexus4,3b3kme,ohhhtravis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:17:36 2015 UTC,Do you think it's worth fixing the screen and reselling? Just asking for an opinion.
nexus4,3b3kme,ohhhtravis,2,Thu Jun 25 20:17:16 2015 UTC,Simply money wise if you replace the screen it's 50-80 to buy the parts. If you can sell it for 100-150 that means you make 50-100 dollars for your time spent fixing the phone. Are you good at detailed oriented tasks that require lots of patience? Try watching a couple YouTube videos on nexus 4 repair and gauge whether or not you can tackle the repair yourself. Keep in mind there is a good chance of messing up other parts of the phone while trying to fix the screen. The repair also might not work requiring a second tear down. Is the 50-100 bucks worth the time and possible frustration or failure?
nexus4,3b3kme,ohhhtravis,2,Thu Jun 25 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, math is off. The possible payoff is 20-100 dollars not 50-100. Also depends on which parts you ultimately need in the end"

nexus4,3aq7v1,a_can_of_solo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:34 2015 UTC,"I got the fast one.  It came out to about the same price as my N4 was new after shipping and taxes.  The bloatware can either be uninstalled or is really non-intrusive and can be virtually hidden using nova prime and Zen UI.  Because the phone has 4GB of ram the extra memory usage is a non issue.  I have mine set up and it looks basically the same as stock Android (can post photos of my locksceeen and home screen if you want).  Everyone says the N4 is a fast device but I can really feel the difference in performance between the two.  The capacative home, back, and recent buttons are really not that bad and I haven't mispressed them yet and got used to them almost instantly.  The power button placement is pretty crappy but I use double tap to wake and sleep so I never use it.  Also the volume rocker on the back is quite pleasant because if I need to change the volume (rare) it's not that hard to get to.  So in all, the bang for buck of this phone can't be beat especially because it seems like its on the cusp of getting CyanogenMod with the bootloader getting unlocked and us just getting TWRP."

Only thing the Idol 3 has on it is the front facing speakers, but the speakers on the OnePlus are actually of pretty high quality and volume compared to the Nexus 4 (came from one to the OnePlus).  Saw you asking about touch screen issues. There are none for me. Even phones that suffered from touch issues do not with the latest touchscreen firmware now officially pushed via OTA. Battery life is incredible compared to the Nexus 4. Only thing holding it back is the mobile radio active bug, but every phone on Lollipop suffers from this.  Get the OnePlus.

nexus4,3afo7i,firstness,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:09:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the hot air lol. I do appreciate the effort. The battery has suddenly started to drain much quicker than normal. I get roughly 6 hours of life. Last week it was more like 16 hours. Due to the rapid battery drain I've tried to turn it off when I didnt need my phone for an hour or so. Last time I turned it off at 50% battery. When I turned it on an hour later I had less than 10%. How is this possible??
nexus4,3afo7i,pizzaparty691,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"If you see the amount that it drains is proportional to the length of time that the phone is off then it would appear that the battery or the electronics are leaking current.  For example you wait 1 hour while the phone is off and it drains 30 percent, or if you wait 2 hours and it drains 60 percent, then it is definitely leaking current.  If not, well I don't know. Either way, it's not a good sign. I suppose the battery could be on its last legs like the other guy was saying. Sorry no other ideas"

I'd say if it's not getting unbearably hot, it's going to be a problem with the calibration of your battery or the condition it's in, and not actually discharging from 80%.  How long has it been since you've done a factory reset or a wipe and flash? Those can help with software issues.

nexus4,3ael4t,neenween,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:35:09 2015 UTC,"Had this issue with mine; it came and went.. Turned out to be a digitizer issue. Cost to repair was high enough that I jumped to the LG G3.    If it happens again, try a diagnostic app like Phone Tester and check the touch/multi-touch functionality. Then try a factory reset as others have mentioned and see what happens. Hope it was just a software bloop!"
nexus4,3ael4t,firstness,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:31:47 2015 UTC,The only time I had digitiser issues was when I had my N4 plugged in to a cheap car charger. There was a certain area of the screen that would not respond to touch. Apparently the power quality was poor enough to affect the digitiser until the phone was unplugged.

Ive since put Chroma rom on it but I had no issues while using stock 5.1.1.  Just my experience of course tho but Ive heard lots of positives from the latest Lollipop upgrade.

nexus4,3a62ez,nicknoxx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:02:07 2015 UTC,12 hours in with 5.1.1 and it's going smoothly so far! I'm barely feeling the performance penalty from my Nexus 5 which I'm pleasantly surprised about.
nexus4,3a62ez,NikolajC,2,Thu Jun 18 09:14:19 2015 UTC,I'd say 4.4.4 was marginally more stable than 5.1.1 but I use non-stock kernels as I like slide/tap to wake.  Xposed is better on 4.4.4 but does work with 5.1.1 (Alpha).  5.1.1 is the first time the phone has worked well since lollipop.

nexus4,3a03q7,forthewin0,4,Tue Jun 16 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"not really.  performance enhancements from a custom ROM are independent of performance enhancements from custom kernels.  they aren't really directly related to each other, but having both optimized ROM and kernel will ultimately give you better performance that having just one or the other optimized.  and likewise, one is better than none."

nexus4,3a1yol,brinmb,2,Tue Jun 16 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"i'm generally hesitant to help these kinds of threads due to the breadth of possible problems you could run into, and then i'd feel obligated to see you through it, and that can end up being a long and stressful process for you.  so first, i'm not sure how xposed will interact with things, you should probably uninstall it or run that disabler.zip.   maybe even disable each module, reboot, then disable or uninstall the framework entirely.  either way, i'd backup everything that you don't want to lose just to be safe... sms, call history, photos, whatever else you can find... i've managed to back up save games that were otherwise hidden away in the root directory using root explorer as well.  make sure you backup externally.  google drive or something.  then get your 5.1.1 image and the latest supersu zip - install both via twrp (ROM then SuperSU) - reboot... your device should have retained root and you should be good to go  there is an alpha version of xposed for 5.1.1 - i've had some problems with it, but have been using it despite that.    some modules will bootloop... sometimes you if you just reboot during a long boot loop, it'll boot up just fine.  another option, if you have the space... multirom.  you can install a 5.1.1 ROM alongside your current one.  you can play around with 5.1.1 as much as you want, and if you fuck it up with the xposed alpha, just boot back into your KK rom.  if you do end up liking it and want to maximize your available space, you can swap it over to your primary ROM and just delete KK entirely.  you'll still need to backup your SMS and such, but each ROM shares the /sdcard folder, so photos and downloads and things would remain as they are currently."
nexus4,3a1yol,unerds,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the extensive reply.  I've heard that you need stock recovery for flashing stock rom, is that true?  Also, I assume I need to update TWRP first?  How safe is MultiROM?"
nexus4,3a1yol,unerds,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure how you'd go about flashing the stock ROM, as i'm not sure if the package you get from google contains a flashable zip?  it might, but either way i've only ever done so using fastboot, and that was only in an effort to revert to stock to essentially start over... never by custom recovery... so i can't say for sure if that'd work.  try this:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/development/rom-stock-flashable-rom-t3084656  the radio, bootloader and an actual flashable stock rom.  still, backup everything you can't stand to lose prior to fucking around with any of this.    multirom has never, not ever even once been the source of my issues.  i've had multirom for well over a year; i've had ubuntu touch running as a secondary, firefox os, a bunch of different AOSP based ROMs at any given time... no issues.  it's a great way to test custom ROMs and other glitchy customization features without risking your data...  the only problems i've ever had were entirely the result of my own impatience/stupidity.  currently, i have a stable CM12.1 running as a primary... it's fully configured, all my apps and everything installed... my launcher is completely set up how i like it and all that.  then, for my secondary ROM, i just copy the primary over (which creates an identical copy, configuration, apps and all) - then i go about with my xposed module tweaking and whatnot...  if it bootloops on me, i just reboot to recovery, delete the secondary and copy the primary back over as a new secondary."

You don't need a stock recovery if you use this, as it will boot your device into bootloader mode and overwrite all the partitions with the 5.1.1 files."

Might be worth holding out for those, or at least letting the hype push down prices on other models."
nexus4,3a022u,Kichigai,3,Tue Jun 16 04:51:55 2015 UTC,"I don't need the newest or best but I see what you say about letting the prices get pushed down. What would you recommend or a n4 replacement? Something with better battery life, camera and $300 or under? Or something that might come down to that price point soon?"
nexus4,3a022u,Kichigai,2,Tue Jun 16 05:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the Nexus 6 might get a price slash on the secondary/used market. And the OnePlus 2 was rumored to have an MSRP of $322, but since the OnePlus One is currently $349 some folks are skeptical. Experia Z3 might come down, and the LG G3 has already dropped in price.  Note all prices are US MSRP, so I have no idea what the price would work out for you in the end."

The Aqua is good but does contain a good amount of bloatware and a not-so visually appealing skin overtop.   Another phone worth looking into is the OPO. I know there's a loud minority complaining about their crappy launch but with the latest price drop and the 6+ hours SOT, its definitely a kickass phone."

nexus4,3a022u,Traducesar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:00:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I live in the UK, and I think my options are LG G3, Asus Zenfone 2 and One Plus One. The Asus has dual sim, which could be very helpful (I have two mobile phone numbers) but the specs on all of them look really nice. I don't know what to do! (first world problems :D )"
nexus4,3a022u,rezadril,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"First world problems indeed. I just bought the OPO, from what I've read the zenfone 2 isn't as good as the oneplus and couldn't be purchased as easily while the g3 was significantly out of my price range. I nixed the z3c because of the price also. I finally had it down to the OPO and the m4. I didn't really want a bigger screen than the m4 but the OPO just seems like the superior phone from all my reading and comparison."
nexus4,3a022u,decanter,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"Well, seems that the G3 has become much cheaper, I can find one in Amazon for £230, but the OPO is £219... gosh, what to do? And yes, the problem of the Asus is that's only available in France (Europe-wise) and all the vendors send them from Taiwan or the like. I think the decision for me it's between the G3 or th OPO. OPO offers a better user experience I heard.  But the G3 has a easy to remove battery, which adds a lot of life to the device (I can buy another battery and change it easily!)."

SuperSU updates over the play store, so that should be fine. As for TWRP, that does not auto-update unless you manually flash the latest version. However, I doubt the update is that important... you should be fine running a little older version of TWRP."

The same physical location on the phone is not responding when you hold the phone in landscape mode, correct?  The unresponsive part of the touchscreen is creeping upwards slowly, every couple of weeks a few more rows of pixels becomes unresponsive.  As a workaround I have made the navigation bar larger, so that it is on the working part of my touch screen. The easiest way to do this is with Xposed framework (you can do it without, but it involves some difficult decompressing, patching and recompressing of system files for which you will need to debug the script there).   After installing Xposed, download the module Dimensions Editor and just make the bar as big as you want.   edit: There might be something else going on. I have done countless reboots and used the phone for many months this way, but for the first time in a while I just did a full reset (via Google's factory image) and my soft keys are working again. Consider the above a workaround; it might be possible to really fix this issue"

That's because Google Play Services holds a lot of libraries that other apps can access for things like location, maps integration, drive integration, etc.  Most likely the problem isn't Google Play Services itself, but another app that is using it for one of its functions. Unfortunately, there's no way to know which app it is because of how the built in battery stats was made.   The first thing I do is limit location permissions for apps I don't feel that need it or that I don't use for location. Then of course, uninstall the heavy hitters like anything Facebook related. Outside of that I'm not sure what you can do.   You could go into Google Play Services settings and clear out all data. Keep in mind you'll lose whatever data it was syncing (if you're using an Android Wear watch, it'll need to be reset). I've done this as a last minute resort when it refuses to behave, and it's usually worked out (but it will be very active on reboot as it tries to resync everything back up before it calms down)."

However, because 4G is not a native radio mode, it will not be able to switch back to it.  Btw, 4G has never appeared for me under preferred network type.

nexus4,3962lb,NeckbeardTheElder,3,Tue Jun 9 19:46:26 2015 UTC,"The battery replacement is not too difficult to do, just get all the right tools, watch the disassembly video and take your time so as not to break the weak spots in the back cover. And don't overtighten the battery terminal screws. If it goes wrong, then you were going to buy a new phone anyway, right?  Took me less than a hour, and that's with taking my time, cleaning dust and gunk out of every crevice and speaker, etc. When I was done, the calibration app wouldn't quite get it right, over multiple calibrations it either died at 16% or went immediately to 80% when I took it off the charger. Doing a manual flash to 5.1.1 (with wipe) solved the calibration issues."

nexus4,3962lb,NeckbeardTheElder,2,Tue Jun 9 23:49:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advise. When you say manual wipe do you mean via adb or via boot menu? I've been doing factory resets always via the boot menu rather than adb because it seemed easier.
nexus4,3962lb,PokeArx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a factory reset, and then there's flashing a new image. Factory reset won't do anything for calibration, I think. I had to upgrade manually to 5.1.1, since I was rooted, so I used the Wugfresh toolkit to flash the 5.1.1 image. When you do that, you can choose wipe (start fresh) or non-wipe (all your stuff stays intact, hopefully). Since I was having problems with the calibration, I backed up what little I needed to, and chose wipe."
nexus4,3962lb,Shimakaze,2,Tue Jun 9 19:54:35 2015 UTC,Ahh i wasn't aware the factory reset and flash would be different for the calibration. I might even give that a go and see if I can squeeze some more life out of the old girl yet!

nexus4,396nkt,vanillajuice,3,Tue Jun 9 17:14:07 2015 UTC,why would you want to? the nexus 4 only has about a 720p resolution? Sorry I know im not answering your question... but just saying....
nexus4,396nkt,HBot106,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:19:20 2015 UTC,Well mostly two reasons.  One for streaming to Chromecast on my 1080p TV.  Two because the nexus 4 has slightly higher then 720p resolution at 768.  But also because if you play a 1080p clip and then a 720p clip of the same thing you can tell a noticeable difference in quality.
nexus4,396nkt,fakehalo,7,Tue Jun 9 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"Chromecast streams directly to your TV, your phone is just the controller, so that doesn't relate/matter.  The handful of pixels you're losing for standard 720p is not worth streaming 1080i content to waste processing power to downscale it. The Nexus 4 is a really a 720p phone with a few extra pixels."
nexus4,396nkt,ayodio,3,Tue Jun 9 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that about the Chromecast thank you.  Resized 1080p video will appear slightly sharper than actual 720 clip, this is due to reduced block size.  I don't mind the small amount of extra processing power."

If your usage continues as it has so far you will get 4 hours.   Since the only thing that has drained battery so far is the screen, if your usage continues exactly the same (unlikely since no apps have registered battery drain yet) you will get 4 hours of screen on usage.  If you turn the screen off and let it sleep for 10 min and check it again (assuming no wakelocks or battery draining apps) the 4 hour estimate will extend out longer because now it sees deep sleep as part of your battery history."

nexus4,38z7yd,bananapaj,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:34:01 2015 UTC,"I forgot to put ""lowering brightness further"" in quotes to imply that that isn't what's going on.    Changing system brightness literally changes the luminosity of the display; more light/photons coming out per pixels. More energy usage.    What apps like Twilight (and I assume screen filter) do is they just darken the colour of the pixels, so to speak. An all white screen at max brightness is brighter than an all black screen at max brightness, even if they use the same amount of energy (not in all cases though, see next paragraph) so if you darken the entire palette of the screen it appears less bright, even though the same amount of light is coming out.    I assume you might have an AMOLED screen though. Those are different. In AMOLED the darker the pixel the less energy it uses, so in your case I assume it does help. AFAIK most phones don't have AMOLED though.    edit: Just noticed this is /r/nexus4, if that's the phone you're using then you don't have AMOLED and something else must be going on."

Example of why Amplify is helpful: Turns out that Google Play Services tries to get your location every couple of minutes. This means that even if you are not using your phone, Google Play Services will wake it up to get the location. With Amplify, you can limit this to a longer time (like once every 10 minutes), so your phone will not wake up as much.  Of course, that was just one example. Google Play Services has LOTS of wakelocks and alarms. Limiting most of the unimportant ones does not have any effect on the phone's performance / usability, but it saves a LOT of battery."

It completely fixed the ghost touching issue that was making my phone pretty much useless. I'm really glad I got the whole assembly, and it wasn't that much harder than doing the battery actually.  The back case came off easier this time than the last, but that's probably because I knew more of what I was doing. The charge port and headphone jack are secured with a little bit of adhesive that you can carefully pry up using the same opening tool that Fixez sends with the screen. You have to switch over the power and volume circuit boards also which are kept in place with a little adhesive strip. I got them free by pulling with my fingers holding the edge of the boards. The last thing was a little piece of rubber up near the top left side of the phone that you move into place on the new frame.  All in all, it wasn't that hard of a process. I imagine it's a lot easier than heating up the glass, prying it off, fishing ribbon cables through and all that.   EDIT: Link for Fixez screen assembly"

nexus4,38rtrr,ronniekinsley,3,Sat Jun 6 07:04:24 2015 UTC,Yeah iirc OTA doesn't work if you have a custom recovery.  The recovery image can be found in the factory image archive here: https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images
nexus4,38rtrr,2ntense,-1,Sat Jun 6 08:23:44 2015 UTC,I know about the factory images portal but I need just the recovery image not the whole ROM.
nexus4,38rtrr,2ntense,6,Sat Jun 6 08:37:30 2015 UTC,The recovery image can be extracted from the factory image archive.
nexus4,38rtrr,2ntense,-6,Sat Jun 6 08:40:29 2015 UTC,"Ofcourse, but why download the whole thing?"
nexus4,38rtrr,ymmajjet,8,Sat Jun 6 08:56:24 2015 UTC,Well that's a way to get the recovery image yourself. It's from a trusted source and you won't have to rely on others.

I'd think its something with programming first.  I would use the Wugfresh Nexus Root Toolkit to wipe then install the image onto your device.

nexus4,3837nw,tpchan87,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:08:04 2015 UTC,I believe you have to install a custom kernel to change this value.

I'm tempted to try giving L one more chance with 5.1.1, but am not going to. 5 is simple not ready for prime time with the Nexus 4. I understand that not everybody encountered problems, but enough did that Google should be ashamed for pushing out a garbage OS to a device that could have easily lost support with Kitkat and we would've understood. Let the people who want to flash and experiment put their devices on L, but don't force it through OTA on the masses.  Kitkat still periodically turns itself off for me, but its rare, unlike multiple times a day on L."
nexus4,37zoof,_eccedentesiast,3,Sun May 31 20:46:25 2015 UTC,Don't use OTA. I fully wiped and installed 5.0.1 stock on one nexus and it rarely has bugs and crashes much less than on 4.4.4. Then I though I'd try euphoria ROM on another phone (better version of cyanogen IMO and nice and simple) so wiped my phone on 4.4.4 and installed euphoria for 5.1 and its also smooth with good battery life and no sleep of death as people like to call it on either phone. I highly recommend wiping and installing euphoria its a great clean ROM
nexus4,37zoof,misspealt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:40:26 2015 UTC,i would like a guide to downgrade since my only problem with my n4 is the battery. But can you take a screenshot with how much screen on time you get on 4.4.4?
nexus4,37zoof,linh_nguyen,5,Sun May 31 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'm at 1h 32m 49s.   As for downgrading, you will need Nexus Root Toolkit. Download and install it.  Open it and do the Full Driver Installation Guide. Follow the on screen instructions and make sure you are in developer mode with debuging enabled (Settings -> About phone -> tap Android version until you enable Developer mode. Then go Settings -> Developer Mode and enable debuging. make sure you get the confirmation dialogue for connecting with your PC and check the ""Always allow from this computer” box).  After driver installation, from the NRT, unlock the Bootloader, again follow step-by-step instructions.  Do a full nandroid backup (optional but recommended. NRT -> Backup -> Create Nandroid Backup w/Custom Recovery).  Install 4.4.4:  NRT - > Flash Stock + Unroot (make sure current status is Device is on/Normal. From the drop down menu, choose what build you want to flash (4.4.4 KTU84P in this case). And check the Automatically download + extract... option below. Leave ""No wipe mode"" unchecked, and check ""Force Flash Mode"" and ""Post-Flash Factory Reset"". Wait for the build to download and follow the on screen instructions.   It should take about an hour (including backup and build download). I was at about 25% battery and didn't care as it was charging via USB, but I do recommend at least 50% battery before you start.  Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you encounter any issues."
nexus4,37zoof,trkeprester,2,Sun May 31 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"For even better battery life, Root the phone using NRT and install Franco Kernel from the PlayStore. It's cheap and worth it. From there, you can tweak the CPU frequency, Governor, etc."
nexus4,37zoof,redd1tt,2,Sun May 31 20:59:06 2015 UTC,i completely forgot about nexus root toolkit! thanks for this! ive been thinking about downgrading so i could try out xposed and gravity box.  but i have a noob question:  would this delete all my user data like pics and text messages? my bootloader was unlocked when i bought my n4 but i never did anything else to it (no root or flashed any kind of rom on it)
nexus4,37zoof,xenago,2,Sun May 31 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"Doing this will delete all your data, that's why I recommend a backup. There is an option to keep user data, but it's best to do a clean flash to avoid any issues."
nexus4,37zoof,Krzysztof_Bryk,2,Mon Jun 1 05:05:53 2015 UTC,Perhaps just try a different kernel? Are you on stock ROM? I'd say try hellscore kernel because its very easy to install. Download hellscore u2d from the play store and use that to install then download hellscore kernel manager. Some tweaks I found to be good are   Set CPU governor to hellsactive Set frequency to 1350 for max and for min drag it all the way down to 94. Scroll down to undervolting set the global offset to -12500 If you want all of this to save every time you reboot then at the top there's a check box set on boot. But just to be on to safe side the first time you set this leave it unchecked to eee if your device runs smooth. If it does then check it. Go to misc and change the IO scheduler to ROW  This is unrelated to battery but I find it helps it run smoother

The only way to fix it is to hard reset   As for the bug, no, Google hasn't yet fixed this bug since it was first discovered...

Still got the original battery.  There are manufacturing defects (as with any product) for batteries, so you just got unlucky.  Also, how ""official"" are replacement batteries? Some brands are probably worse than stock."
nexus4,37y3p4,JimboLodisC,2,Sun May 31 15:03:45 2015 UTC,"nothing wrong with leaving charger in. devs know not to push the battery chemistry too far so when it gets to like 90% full, the device shows 100%. behind the scenes, the device knows better than to just keep accepting a charge as soon as it can find space to stay where it was at around 90% full. it drains a few percent before it starts charging again, even if the phone still says 100 or 99. that's why sometimes a device quickly gets to 97 just a few moments after you unplug it and other times it doesnt. if you unplug from the charger for a few mins when it shows 100 or 99 and then plug it back in, you can trick it into pushing a little more juice in even though it's not good for long term battery health. i think ppl call it bump charging.   http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=871051"

nexus4,37ruky,totalBS,-3,Fri May 29 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"If they're ""testing it"" and our hardware is capable of running it, why would they choose to scrap it afterwards?"
nexus4,37ruky,VirtualMontage,-3,Sat May 30 05:30:04 2015 UTC,Because it's not feasible to support an old device?
nexus4,37ruky,cody2224,1 point,Sat May 30 09:13:00 2015 UTC,Why decide to begin developing an M build for it then?
nexus4,37ruky,VirtualMontage,4,Sat May 30 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"How else would they know whether or not it performs well and/or is easy to get working? If it takes them a long time to get bugs fixed and get everything working then they'll probably drop it since the effort isn't worth it for an old phone. Also, if the performance is lacking then they'll drop it too. But if it's quick and easy to get M working then we might just see it"
nexus4,37ruky,totalBS,1 point,Sat May 30 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"So as of now, all we know is that Google is working on bringing Android M to the Nexus 4?"
nexus4,37ruky,VirtualMontage,3,Sat May 30 17:08:40 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much. I'm surprised they're even testing it so there's hope
nexus4,37ruky,totalBS,3,Sat May 30 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean much. Most  of  the code here will be common across all  phones. The camera  reboot  bug shows us they don't actually care about fixing issues with this phone, so  getting anything new running on it crash free and buttery smooth, if it  requires changes  to  blobs,  won't happen."

nexus4,37ruky,Guardian_452,1 point,Sat May 30 18:47:13 2015 UTC,Google released the source some time during the summer and I think the devs brought the Nexus 7 rom over for the nexus 4.
nexus4,37ruky,_FluX23,1 point,Sat May 30 22:34:53 2015 UTC,yes since the '13 nexus 7 has an s4 pro like the nexus 4 so it wasn't too hard to port across

Any way I can see the battery's health before I replace it?
nexus4,37olbx,VirtualMontage,24,Fri May 29 04:21:22 2015 UTC,Probably. Lollipop wasn't even a sure thing. But we'll have custom roms working in no time
nexus4,37olbx,totalBS,10,Fri May 29 04:41:02 2015 UTC,I think we're going to see a lot of nice custom M ROMs. And the nexus 4 hardware is more than enough to run it I think. So no need to worry.

nexus4,37olbx,tylercoder,2,Fri May 29 17:09:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this seems to be common practice with handset providers. As a developer, I can understand that Google does not want to invest the resources to support ageing handsets. It's a slap in the face though, when the only nexus alternative is to upgrade to an $800 phablet.  I'll keep my money and flash a custom rom."
nexus4,37olbx,nicknoxx,1 point,Sun May 31 05:24:24 2015 UTC,I kind of regret moving from 4.4.4 to Lollipop and wouldn't go for M in any case.  Sometimes the hardware just works better with older version of software.  When the phone dies I'll upgrade.
nexus4,37olbx,SimMac,-8,Fri May 29 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous, Google! The Nexus series could be a real showcase for Googles Android updates. How should OEMs support their devices for more than two years if not even Google themselves support their Nexus line for three years?

nexus4,37lelz,ohgeetee,4,Thu May 28 13:58:17 2015 UTC,I jumped ships too but because I was already due for an update. I most likely would have stayed with another nexus phone but the cameras on these phones are terrible compared to the galaxy s6.   I'm hoping the G4 works out for you since I've heard about a lot of problems for the G3.

The battery absolutely sucks - it goes down very quickly and takes forever to charge up again; I get the silent calls issue, but all I have to do is just restart my phone and then it works fine; and occasionally it will freeze or brick up, and what I have to do is just plug it in and hold the power button and it turns on.

As I said there, I had problems updating from 5.1 to 5.1.1, and finally I used the Windows command line to flash the new factory image. I only skip flashing the userdata.img and the recovery.img, so I kept both my apps with all their data and the custom recovery. Are you rooted and with a custom recovery? Mine did also the reboot, and the reason it's because the OTA zip file can be flashed on the recovery. This guide on XDA is very helpful as well."

Usually, if I flip the prongs the other way and plug it back in, it'll switch.  It's such a constant that I made a Tasker scene that'll pop up when I plug in my phone that tells me whether it's AC or USB.  Then I can just switch it if I need to."

You will lose root, your custom DPI, your custom font(s), and any custom kernel settings. Xposed app and modules are still in my system, but the framework is disabled.

Hold down vol dn + power.  Keep holding and plug into computer.  You'll hear the computer repeatedly connect and disconnect as the phone attempts to power on. You can plug it directly into a wall as well but you won't get the feedback on the power cycling from the computer that way.  Eventually it will gain just enough juice to get into recovery. Once you're there, just leave it plugged in for an hour."

Once the calibration is corrected, it shouldn't discharge as deeply."
nexus4,378pec,Krzysztof_Bryk,1 point,Tue May 26 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. Yeah, from what I've read if you have a flashing red light the power and vol. down should work to turn on the phone. But for a solid red light this didn't work."
nexus4,378pec,Krzysztof_Bryk,2,Tue May 26 03:38:59 2015 UTC,red light comes when you discharge battery till the point it will not fully pass the boot procedure and currently used charging method fails to deliver enought power to charge during that period. unplug from pc or whatever the juice source is and connect to wall charger (use lg charger and wire) for 15 minutes or so - device must have a power source of ~+800mA

Short answer is its worth it, better to get a new screen on it ASAP than risk causing yourself damage on the broken glass or the digitizer going before you've got your files off it  The parts on average for me were about £35 or so, and it takes about an hour to do. The screen came with all the parts I need, and you just YouTube a ""How to replace screen on <insert phone here>"", and there'll be a 30 minute tutorial on it and it'll be fine. Its a piece of cake now  In terms of does it make sense, yes depending on your finances :P An LCD replacement for the Nexus 4 is about £35 off eBay.

nexus4,3701nu,dark79,1 point,Sat May 23 16:45:04 2015 UTC,How did u get it to stick? That sticky substance went away and it never held. It kept sliding off the charging would keep turning on and off. It was too precise. A flat back one works a lot better.
nexus4,3701nu,dark79,3,Sat May 23 16:48:41 2015 UTC,I just clean it with water every once in a while. I've had it since launch and have never had a problem getting it to stick again after wiping it clean with a damp cloth.
nexus4,3701nu,JimboLodisC,2,Sat May 23 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"I've only had to clean mine once due to dust since I got it. I have a Diztronic case though, so maybe that's why mine has always held on."

Wireless charging is one of those things people scoff at as a gimick until they actually try it. I still feel like the touchstone on the Pre was the best one yet... the base was weighted and sticky.. no chance of it moving. In fact, it was quite hard to remove by the time my Pre was done.  And they had magnets from the get go."
nexus4,3701nu,linh_nguyen,1 point,Sat May 23 17:07:58 2015 UTC,Yes I loved the Palm Pres orb. I figured when the N4s orb came out it would have been exactly the same but it isn't. It doesn't have those magnets to connect it easily. You have to guess and fiddle to make sure its angled correctly.  Yes I've read that is the solution to keep wiping it clean every week or so from all the dust it collects but I find that terrible from a wireless charging device that costs 40 dollars.  These cheaper alternatives from 10-15 dollars from China work better IMO.

I also installed Xposed, Amplify, and G3 Tweaksbox. The only niggle is losing vibration on upgrading to CloudyG2. Otherwise, at $190, it is a fantastic value.

The nexus 6 is a TV and not a phone  2. The ever increasing number of apps which ask for every permission and give me only the choice of letting them take all, or go live in a cave  3. Lollipop killed Xposed and Xprivacy. Installed the new alpha Xposed and tried Xprivacy again but all it did was bootloop my phone 4. Cyanogen is stuck in nightlies and recently announced partnership with Truecaller. I dint trust them any more.  An android with clean AOSP and no Gapps and only FOSS apps is probably better for privacy than an iPhone, but practically I can't do that. For mainstream use, i find ios to be more responsible in terms of my privacy.  TL;DR: Sold out and  switched to iPhone"

Things I wanted, didn't get all of it:   Small(er) size Good point and shoot camera Good battery life Front facing speakers Notification LED Close to stock Android with timely updates Wireless charging    Didn't matter: * Whether it was a Nexus * High resolution screen * Removable battery * Micro SD slot"
nexus4,36tyi9,redpudding,1 point,Fri May 22 06:11:05 2015 UTC,In the same boat regarding an Alcatel Idol 3. My main reason for upgrading from my N4 is that the earphone jack was messing up and so I had to listen to music via bluetooth all the time which drained battery quickly.

It is true that it wont go as bright as the s6 but I don't know a single person who sets the brightness of their phone to full, it's just too bright.  If you want something bright and looks a bit saturated, just set your color mode of the Zen2 to vivid and the brightness to about 60%. That's more than enough.  If you compare it to the Nexus 4, it is definitely brighter (brightness set to 50% on both phones)."

Worst part is the Google Nexus support website asks you to provide your phone number so they can call you. How am I supposed to do that when my phone won't even turn on to receive their call? -_-  I don't think I'm under warranty with them anymore but I assume they would know more about their own OS issue than LG.

nexus4,36n70e,jo1114pa,3,Wed May 20 20:48:43 2015 UTC,Go to: Settings->Apps->RUNNING You will see the Device memory graph. The black portion is the memory used by the system. In previous version this portion slowly grew from day to day till system went crazy. Now it is stable and never grows above 300~400mb. I am using 5.1.1 for 2 weeks. No leaks.

nexus4,36j7tm,DeliciousToastie,5,Tue May 19 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"Seems like it's been a while since you did this, so I recommend to update to latest TWRP first.   The standard option to do a wipe in TWRP is to do a factory reset. That's all you need. This wipes only your actual system and caches. You will keep all your SD card data Yes you will lose Xposed. Xposed is a mod installed to your system. Wiping system will lead to deleting Xposed too.  To get Root back just flash SuperSU after flashing the ROM. The size of a nandroid backup depends on your storage. It backs up all of your data. My backups are around 1.5gb, but I dont have any msuic on my phone. I have always around 5gb free space on my phone.   Yes you can do backups on your PC. Here is a nice guide for that   The factory reset will also get rid of the kernel. After Wiping and installing the new ROM, you will have the stock kernel. Now you can flash whatever kernel you like."
nexus4,36j7tm,haelmchen,2,Tue May 19 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"I just flashed Euphoria this past weekend. Here are the steps you need to take: 1. Update your TWRP recovery to latest version 2. Make a Nandroid backup (it doesn't hurt to uninstall some apps to slim the backup down). If you want to put it on your PC afterwards you can just copy the folder onto your computer (/sdcard/TWRP/Backups) 3.  Download Euphoria ROM and a Gapps package as described in the Euphoria forum thread. 4. Reboot to TWRP. Wipe using the default factory reset option. 5. Add Euphoria ROM and then Gapps to the flash queue 6. Reboot to system and your phone should be useable, download apps you need from the Play Store.    To enable root in Euphoria, first enable developer options, then turn on root access to Apps or (Apps and ADB if you wish). When an app requests root you'll get a popup as usual. The root access manager is a bit hard to find, it's in Privacy -> Privacy Guard -> Advanced (in overflow menu) -> Swipe left to the last group which is Root Access. You can also flash Superuser or SuperSU as an alternate root manager.  For Xposed: You'll need to flash the ""super alpha"" build of Xposed for 5.1. See details here."
nexus4,36j7tm,Tellah_the_White,1 point,Wed May 20 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I've flashed the ROM and Kernel - I've lost all my apps but I managed to keep backups of my SMS and Contacts so all is not lost. I'm spending time now installing apps that I want and testing to see if Xposed works.   So far Euphoria is a great ROM - everything is extremely smooth and there a load of options available. The only problem - which is very minor - is the fact that there is little customization of the Power menu. From what I've seen I can't find the option to add ""Boot To Recovery"" - which would be a really handy option to have. Other than that - it's a great ROM!"

nexus4,36fjq1,motophiliac,1 point,Tue May 19 07:36:32 2015 UTC,You can factory reset/wipe a phone from fastboot.  Like 'fastboot -w' will erase userdata and cache (and format if supported by partition type)  Or you can download the latest factory image from google and this should fix your problem if its a non hardwares. Also if your planning on rooting again I'd recommend a battery calibrator (and possibly an CPU underclocker if temps remain high).

(it is simple and easy, search for howto in youtube) (maybe some connector problems). if still doesn't work - throw it away."

For at&t it's missing bands 2,5 and...20? And for T-Mobile it's missing 2 and 12.  That being said, it's worked great for me on att, but my LTE speeds have suffered a bit when in downtown Minneapolis that would have been alleviated a bit if I had band 2."
nexus4,366njq,minnesnowta,1 point,Sun May 17 11:14:52 2015 UTC,I jumped from a N4 to a 1+. I'd do it a million times more. No problems at all. No regrets.

I had a issue where I couldn't hear anyone while calling.  Also one annoying thing, on 5.1 switch from wifi to mobile network doesnt work on its own, I need to turn airplane mod on and off quickly to get it to switch to mobile data which is really annoying since I forget about that, leave the house and than 2 hours later find out that I was offline."

As you may already know, many modules don't work on initial version of super alpha due to changes in ART between LP 5.0 - 5.1. I took an effort to go through all the changes in ART to find out what could be done to improve the framework for better 5.1 compatibility, and managed to identify areas where adjustments had to be made.    This means, this version should have better support for all those modules that were previously causing boot loops or other unexpected system/app crashes  Regarding GravityBox; to avoid further confusion/speculations. Current version of GB is not fully compatible with Lollipop 5.1, yet. It will refuse to start on 5.1 even after  xposed framework is updated to this new super alpha.

If there was a custom ROM that was truely unique then i could be interested....  Edit: gravity box has just become available for 5.1.

The few times I've done this, I noticed I could start the phone again about 1 minute after it shut down. Keep attempting to switch it on until it just won't start any longer, and then charge it up in one go, from 0% to 100% with no interruption.   This will re-set the battery's fuel gauge. The kernel you use doesn't matter, as they all receive the same info from the battery's computer."
nexus4,35v3oc,xenyz,3,Wed May 13 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"According to battery university & other sources, this method MUST NOT be used with Li-ion batteries. Over-discharge will kill the battery permanently. The recommended calibration levels are 10%-100%."

It has protection circuits built-in to avoid this scenario, and anyone who is having the uncalibration problem has experienced what happens: sudden power loss, with no shutdown sequence.   If you fully discharge and then fully charge, leaving the battery 'empty' for a small amount of time, and only do this from time to time, it is not going to hurt it.

This saves a lot of battery. A wake lock is something an application can set to prevent the phone from going into sleep mode, which usually means the application wants to do something in the background and then release the lock to allow the phone back into a low power state.

nexus4,35tr49,marsovec,6,Wed May 13 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"Google Play Services holds libraries that other apps hook into for various functions. For example, if an app wants to check location, it makes the call to Google Play Services. Unfortunately, battery stats only shows what app is ultimately causing the wake lock and not the app that requested it. So Google Play Services rises to the top despite the cause being a completely different app.  So just disabling Google Play Services isn't the right way to go about it. Unfortunately, no one really knows what the right way is. I find that installing App Ops (needs root) and selectively disabling permissions for individual apps works better to manage my wakelocks while not breaking functionality than just blacklisting Google Play Services altogether."

Might bear saying that the phone was also having other issues before the factory reset that it isn't now, sometimes it wouldn't acknowledge my screen taps when a call was coming in and I was trying to answer it, yet dismissing calls always would work.

If you want to judge picture quality yourself, here are some pictures I took over the weekend: http://imgur.com/a/JUpla  You can long press the dedicated shutter button while the device is locked and it will instantly launch the camera app. Focus is quite fast and accurate, but definitely still a level below the LG G3 or Galaxy S6.

I placed two orders for three items total (two N4 screens and a set of tools) and received my purchase in a reasonable amount of time. My anecdotal experience with them is good.  I don't really have any way to know for certain that the screen I received is OEM. I still have the first screen I received and it has LG printed on it, along with the same part number as the original screen. Of course that would be pretty easy to fake. I have no problems with the display (color, brightness, etc.). However, I don't have access to another N4 so I have nothing to objectively compare the quality to, but it is not different enough to be obviously non-OEM. The notification light also appears to be the same as my original screen.  The replacement screens I received have also seemed to be more durable than my original, but I have no way of know if the new screens would have survived the drop that broke my original. There is only one difference that I have noticed between the original and replacement screens, the digitizer grid is less visible on the new screens. I have one of the first batches of N4s (no feet on the back) so I just assumed that the digitizer was also subtly tweaked after launch.

Not that buying a new phone is cheaper than replacement parts, it hasn't hit that point yet, but the Nexus 4 is definitely on it's last legs. I wouldn't be surprised if it does not get Android M when Google announces it.  You'll likely spend close to $60 fixing this phone with aftermarket parts. Asus just released the Zenfone 2 which is about $200 with much better specs. Think long and hard if this is worth it."

When the sound was off, I'd still get this occasional static speaker click when I touched the screen. It wasn't every touch, and it wasn't even that frequent, but it was annoying.  I fixed it by disabling the ""sound on keypress"" option in the keyboard options. This shouldn't have mattered since the sound was off anyway, but it stopped the static noise. It bothered me for several weeks, and after turning it off, all has been well since."

Battery life when the phone is mainly idle is about the same as kitkat (about 24 hours), battery life when I'm using the phone lots is quite a bit more than kitkat.  Its frustrating though, battery drain is very inconsistent - When I look at my battery stats I have periods of a few hours where the phone was completely idle and battery drops at 1% an hour, then a couple of hours when it drops 5% an hour.  Main culprit of high battery drain is Android OS. If it managed to stay in the low power state battery life would be amazing."

nexus4,35p11p,wisejoeyd,2,Thu May 14 10:40:49 2015 UTC,"Similar happened overnight recently to my phone and I think that it may be that a cell has gone bad in the pack.  (Bearing in mind I don't know how the battery is arranged or built; it could be several battery cells or one big one.  If it was made of smaller cells then that is what my hunch is based on).  Why do I think this? It was a replacement battery.  My second as I wanted to see if I could get rid of the weird insta-drop of 15% when unplugging the first after charging.  The second replacement battery fared better in this regard, though still would happen often enough. So Whatev's...  Recently with 5.1 I'd been getting really good battery usage.  Would unplug in morning, an hour or so before leaving for the day, and come home and there'd still be ~20-30% which for a Nexus 4, my Nexus 4, was great.  Even got more than 4 hours Screen On Time lazing about one morning reading Reddit is Fun :)  Anyway, woke up just a few days ago and it was off. Odd.  I know it was down to about 15% but even then it can usually last overnight.   Wouldn't turn on.  Had to charge it for a few minutes before the battery meter even showed up.  Powered on, and checked the battery stats.  It had suddenly flatlined halfway through the night .  Ok, well as the old posters would say:  Keep Charging and Carry On  But immediately I noticed I was getting home and it'd be borderline 15%, and this was with NO Google Music playing in work during the day (note: I always just played music already downloaded to my device so minimal network anyway and still was on a good 30% or so, even 40-50 which boggled the mind!).    So I don't know... sudden flatline, and immediately a perceptible drop in SoT. This is why I feel/wonder that all these sudden tanking battery %'s, not least my own recent one, may be an internal fault making itself felt and I wonder if I've lost a cell or something as it seems to have been dealt a body blow to the stamina of my once formidable battery...."

nexus4,35i2nf,Snerual22,3,Sun May 10 21:17:21 2015 UTC,How similar is the size of the phone compared to the nexus? Also can you get through a full day with heavy use?
nexus4,35i2nf,sxehoneybadger,2,Sun May 10 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"It's noticeably narrower than the n4 when holding it in your hand. It's also less tall but you can only tell when putting them side by side. Basically the screen is the exact same height but less wide. (16:9 vs 16:10 screen in the nexus) but it has smaller bezels in all directions.  I've only had it for 3 days but battery life is almost double of the n4. Maybe more. I just had 4,5h screen on time and 36h standby and still had around 30% battery left. It's really amazing!"

Those can be backed up and restored now. So if taking pictures is not your main priority you can still try out cm 12.1 and then switch back to stock later while getting back the full picture quality.  Besides, from what I've seen, even on a custom rom without those drm keys the pictures are still much better than the nexus 4."

Even some of the big companies like Samsung & Sony are not the quickest to get new releases out either, and since the its a $250 phone if it lasts a couple years without major problems I would be happy..  Hopefully, someone might crack the bootloader and maybe open up custom roms.. It's a low cost phone with alot of hardware for the price."
nexus4,35i2nf,jlewisnj,1 point,Mon May 11 01:28:25 2015 UTC,"If i'd be you, i'd avoid Alcatel's Idol line. I worked for a canadian carrier for the last 3 years and have sent more Alcatel phones back to warranty(Over 2 generation of Idol phones) than i have for any other manufacturer during my whole time as representative. They have awesome specs and the price is more than reasonnable. Sadly, they're just not reliable and the cellphone usually feels really cheap despite looking somewhat good. The 3rd one is definitely the best yet but in my opinion, it still feels inferior to my now 3 years old Nexus 4 quality-wise. I'd probably skip a generation to make sure Alcatel resolved all those reliability problems."
nexus4,35i2nf,thetruekimmox,1 point,Mon May 11 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"In the same boat as well. Really looking forward to the MicroSD and the FM Radio as well.

Recently, she got a S6 and I got a Nexus 6. Mainly it's because we've invested heavily and become really addicted to Qi Wireless charging. Thus, those two are the only flagships for us to choose."
nexus4,35i2nf,lonaysta,3,Sun May 10 16:48:29 2015 UTC,which one do you prefer and why?
nexus4,35i2nf,marsovec,4,Sun May 10 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"S6 and N6? First of all, they are both great phones (of course because you bought them huh?). The main differences come in the following ways:   Screen size and, how they look. This is quite personal and everyone has his or her own preference. Personally I prefer the feel and size of S6 over N6, but I also like N6's feel and I can handle the size. Software. Touchwiz vs Pure Android. I believe most redditors here will vote for the latter without thinking. Same with me, lol. This is actually the most important reason I chose N6 over S6. My GF, on the other hand, is not as picky regarding this. However she got a international version to minimalize carrier impact as well. Camera. S6 wins with no doubt. But I'm don't take photos quite much, possibly because I'm from a N4 and don't have quite high expectation on phone photography... and I also have a SONY A6000 for dedicated photography, so it's no big issue for me. Other factors. For battery life, N6 is okay, though not great, for me. S6 might be slightly better, but that improvement doesn't make a difference that matters. I don't quite play games on phones so heat and performance other than daily apps do not bother me.    I was given the choice between several flagship phones when picking an upgrade: M9, S6, ip6/6+, N6, X Gen2,..all at&t phones since I could spend the $650 at&t credit on any of them. And finally I chose N6, mostly for Qi and pure Android.  but that's me, and ymmv always."
nexus4,35i2nf,lonaysta,3,Sun May 10 19:02:14 2015 UTC,I bought an Xperia Z2 last week. So far I'm really liking it.

Insanely good battery life. Design aesthetics that rival apple.   Zero regrets!  Stock android is overrated. I'm very happy with this phone (I had the nexus 4 since launch)
nexus4,35i2nf,blusky75,1 point,Wed May 13 04:38:26 2015 UTC,Well if I can knock out another year on this device it would be awesome. I'm gonna stay with the Nexus family though and get the next one when my 4 stops working.

I used fixez.com but their customer service reps are cunts. My screen was fine and install went well. But my phone wouldn't charge afterwards. So I purchased a new battery and port connector. While at it, I ordered another battery new back and screen for my wife's N4.  Low and behold my phone started charging 15 mins after placing the order and I immediately canceled. I get my refund but there is a 10% CANCELATION FEE. And if you return anything it's a 20% restocking fee.

nexus4,35ebfd,eightysguy,3,Sat May 9 19:27:55 2015 UTC,Well the highest was when I was backing up my PC for the first time. Had about 1.6 TB to upload over two months. The other amounts is p2p transfers for a bunch of Linux distros. Also have a file/web server running 24/7.

nexus4,35ebfd,IAmABritishGuy,1 point,Sun May 10 00:57:28 2015 UTC,I've currently got a 5gb monthly limit as internet through my phone is the only internet available to me where I live (other than satellite which is ridiculous) and anymore than 5 is unaffordable to me (damn Canada).

nexus4,35ebfd,Sythus,1 point,Sat May 9 16:57:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I do the same except I get by on <1gb. So I get the redpocket $5/month/.5gb data only plan and that's all I need. I use that with a VPN for public WiFi and usually have a few MB left each month. It's just not worth it for me to shell out the kind of cash most people do for data when I can slightly alter my usage patterns and save hundreds of dollars per year.

nexus4,35ebfd,goofygooberrock,2,Sat May 9 21:21:28 2015 UTC,I tend to download the songs I like most onto my device through Spotify. Then play that music on my way to work and home. When I get to work I use WiFi to listen to whatever again.

nexus4,35791t,RokkitFrog,1 point,Thu May 7 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of issues to individually troubleshoot, but before you lose all hope and abandon your phone, I think you should do a clean flash of your system. You'll lose anything stored on your phone (apps, stored passwords, etc.) but google does a pretty handy job of backing up the important stuff like photos and contacts. The easiest way to do it as far as I know, is using the wugfresh nexus root toolkit. It's pretty straightforward, especially if you have an IT background, but if you have any questions, or would like clarification, let me know. The only difficult will be connecting the phone to your computer. The issue may end up being as simple as using a different cord, plugging into a different port, or having the right drivers installed, but I believe nexus root toolkit walks you through all of that."

I'm not a phone expert, nor technologically educated either, so don't take my opinion as a statement/advice, but I think you should dump it.  Go for the latter option. Save up for a new better phone.

But I think it's unfair to judge any phone to the N4.  Sure the materials on the OnePlus are cheap compared to say the S6, but that's like comparing a Mercedes C class to a Corolla.  Of course the materials are going to be inferior on something that costs half the price.

Each time the solution for me involves some weird, random fix that seems to vary update to update. Last update, 5.0, I uninstalled the Netflix app and didn't see the problem again save for when I installed some random game. Uninstalling the game fixed the Sleep of Death problem again. In previous patches, preventing the wifi from being on during sleep seemed to help (but did not eliminate the problem completely). Same goes for turning off auto-updates in the Play Store.  I'm not an expert, but I might try uninstalling Netflix (if you have it on there) or clearing out apps you use infrequently. If that doesn't fix it, I'd go one by one with your other apps. If that doesn't fix it, man, I got no idea. But since 5.0, the Sleep of Death issue for me has been related to app installs. Not sure if it's that way for others.   I factory default'd the phone multiple times, did many clean installs, and that never seemed to make any difference, fwiw."

nexus4,34trsw,kingofplanetfap,5,Mon May 4 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"I cannot believe the number of people who dirty flash or upgrade instead of format and clean install. I just don't get it. If the standard with PC is to format completely and do a clean install, why is the phone any different? In my opinion, its a 100% given fact that if you do an upgrade of the OS without it clean format, there will be problems, 100 percent of the time. Whether you notice them or not, that's another thing.  Personally, I've had my Nexus since the day it came out, I have formatted every time I have installed a new operating system, and I have never had less than 5 hours of screen on time, never had a sleep of death, and never had a memory leak. The only issue I can confirm, is that the phone restarts if the camera is used heavily or in rapid fire. This is a hardware issue, there's no escaping it. Every other issue reported, in my opinion, is simply due to bad practice."
nexus4,34trsw,CanadianMEDIC_,5,Mon May 4 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"And most people will never upgrade the operating system on their computer. If the average person bought a computer 10 years ago with XP on it, chances are it still has XP today. Even if they do an OS upgrade, they will likely do the upgrade without doing a clean install (and then probably whine about how it was faster before).   Android has been a different story, where carrier devices will automatically install OTAs that leave the UI unchanged but upgrade the Android OS or other core components under the hood, and users expect the ""I don't need to do shit"" mentality to carry over when using custom ROMs or manually flashing official ones.   The problem (though in my opinion it isn't a problem, per se) here is that the official OS releases from the carriers (I wouldn't even include Google/AOSP in this) place a far higher importance on making sure that carrying over /data and other user configuration WILL NOT BREAK any new releases, than they would on actually adding new features.   So, while it is true that doing a dirty flash is a bad practice, why should we be content with that? It is the intended method of updating for 99.9% of Android users."
nexus4,34trsw,tstarboy,6,Mon May 4 18:04:10 2015 UTC,Sorry to say I did a fresh install the first time I upgraded to 5.1. I even factory reset the device after the upgrade. Yet I still got problems until I used above method.
nexus4,34trsw,Endoroid99,4,Mon May 4 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"I did a fresh install when i moved up to 5.0 and i had SoD, big time. Clearing data for google play services made a HUGE difference. I get maybe one a week now instead of 4-5 a day.   So while you're not wrong, we certainly can't blame all these issues on dirty installs"
nexus4,34trsw,FormerSlacker,3,Mon May 4 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"First off, clean install or OTA, it has nothing to do with the bug, it only delays the inevitable.    This is a hardware issue, there's no escaping it.    If it was a hardware issue it'd be present in all Android versions, but it's not. SOD's blew up at the exact moment 5.0 hit, a clear indication that it's software related. You've never experienced it because your usage patterns don't trigger it.   From what I've seen, it's probably related to the video subsystem, and I bet it's related to this old bug: http://www.androidcentral.com/netflix-and-google-working-android-43-device-lock-solution  Basically, Google worked around a bug on the N4 that it introduced in 4.3, which mostly worked with subsequent versions but now has reared it's ugly head with the 5.0. The only difference now being that Google doesn't give a shit about fixing bugs on the N4, so it'll never be fixed or even acknowledged.   The other big cause IMO is Google Play Services.   Every other issue reported, in my opinion, is simply due to bad practice.   Right. Because the 1000+ people who star'd the muted audio bug in less than a month are all ""using it wrong""  Google's software QA is absolute shit, that's all there is to it."
nexus4,34trsw,trkeprester,1 point,Mon May 4 20:24:21 2015 UTC,"it's totally possible for it to be a hardware issue, and not to be present in all android versions.  all it takes is some variation in the timing of some piece of the hardware, plus some code to exploit that difference to expose the difference as a phone-crippling-bug, et voila, SOD bug is caused by HW 'issue' (possibly).    lollipop would be that software which exploits the difference to cripple people's phones and strongarm them into buying new goddamn phones"
nexus4,34trsw,FormerSlacker,1 point,Tue May 5 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"You're describing a software driver issue.   Simply speaking, if two pieces of software do the same thing, and one of them doesn't work properly on the same hardware, the problem isn't the hardware."

Sure, software may be able to handle it correctly in some cases, but if it's out of hardware specs then it's a hardware issue.    No way to tell who is to blame here.  Many people seem to have problems, while others do not.  Seems to indicate some hardware variation. Is the hardware acting out of specification or is android not correctly handling things? Can be impossible to attribute sometimes.   I'm a firmware engineer this is my life. Usually it's software, just by probability.  Occasionally it's hardware."
nexus4,34trsw,FormerSlacker,1 point,Tue May 5 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"When people say it's the hardware, they are implying that something has changed, the hardware has somehow gone bad.  The thing is the hardware hasn't changed, nothing has gone bad, the only thing that changed is the software. The software has gone bad.   If the hardware is built out of specifications and only works on one version of the software because of luck or workarounds,   It's not luck, virtually every driver in existence has to work around esoteric usage cases for each particular model.   If it can be worked around in software (and it clearly can based on known early working versions), and your software doesn't do it, there is a clear problem with said software.   Google has a long and established track record of completely ignoring issues on the N4, and I see zero indication to believe this is anything but that.   Saying it's a hardware issue is a cop-out that deflects from the real issue, Google's complete lack of software QA."
nexus4,34trsw,trkeprester,2,Tue May 5 03:55:38 2015 UTC,"OK, I agree with you on that, the software has definitely gone bad.  though I disagree that it's a lack of QA, I'd say it's just that google just DGAF about n4.  there are people at google that are deliberately ignoring and closing these issues because they simply don't have to fix them, and life goes merrily on.  i'd say collusion with hardware manufacturers but i'm just a stupid conspiracy douchebag"

Noped right the hell out of the One Touch Idol after looking at the specs, too. A worse CPU, smaller battery, smaller screen with a lower pixel density, released only a couple months after the N4, half the RAM, no QI charging, and a Mediatek CPU to top it off, signalling the death of the plethora of ROMs that help the N4 so much. This doesn't even touch on the ease of rooting and restoring to factory settings, either.

There are certainly benefits with a phone vs a dedicated camera. I suppose my priority in choosing a phone is one that works.  I suppose though if I had to give a priority to a camera feature, it would be speed and how fast I can grab my phone and take a picture.

With a refresh coming within 6 months I wouldn't pull the trigger on one now most likely (although I still say it's a decent phone for the price).   The best stock experience is probably going to be a Nexus 6, Z3/Z3 compact (or Z4), or even the S6 with a 3rd party launcher (I like Nova)."
nexus4,34pkl5,pontiacks,5,Sun May 3 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Same here. It really is the best current ""Nexus 4""-like phone: high-end hardware and easy rooting/romming/personalization for comparatively cheap. Even the ""it was hard to get ahold of, for awhile"" dealio will be familiar to early N4 adopters.  For the price it really can't be beat, even a year on. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking to buy now.   PS - I've recently switched launchers from Nova to Action. Both are very nice but I particularly like the app drawer of Action."

Better battery life was a big factor to me (could only squeeze about 11 hours from my Nexus 4 at best barely using it), also wanted a bigger phone with a bigger resolution. Was thinking of getting a Note 4 but I just really don't like Samsung smartphones... So went with the Nexus 6. After a few modifications I love this phone, if I really use the phone I can run it down to maybe 10% before bed, normally I could stretch it out to 2 days. Very powerful as well :)"

nexus4,34pkl5,MrMario2011,3,Sun May 3 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"Quick charge was another thing I forgot about! I took that into account as well, my Nexus 4 battery life got horrible after the second update I flashed to it so worst case I thought ""Well if the battery life for my N6 ever goes to crap I can at least charge it super fast!"" A great feature compared to my Nexus 4 where I pretty much had to charge it at least 2 hours at work before I left if I wanted it to still have some juice before I went to bed.  The size puts off a lot of people or impresses them, no one in the middle. I thought the size of the Nexus 4 was great but I wanted a big phone. Happy now with a big phone."

nexus4,34pkl5,ryantyrant,1 point,Sun May 3 18:55:06 2015 UTC,Is there that much of a difference using it encrypted vs unecrypted? Is it worth the hassle of having to flash all updates?

nexus4,34pkl5,yortmc,1 point,Mon May 4 02:38:02 2015 UTC,I'm curious with the phone so cheap why did you choose to buy with a contract ? Its debatable whether unlocking and rooting your phone is allowed while contract I suppose. I always have and not had any issues but I get it.

nexus4,34pkl5,Darkencypher,1 point,Sun May 3 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"I just got the S6, it's not worth the price and it's just not a good phone for daily use, too many flaws at this time, not sure if they can fix it with any software updates. It gets really hot with multiple apps being open and battery just goes down fast. I don't think the Auto brightness works well either. As well it lags when it's hot, so that' disappointing.   I switched back to Z2 yesterday and the battery is so much better, nothing lags, everything is nice and smooth. The only thing Samsung has for it with S6 is the fingerprint scanner for Samsung Pay and the camera is amazing. The edge definitely feels nice though. Standby time sucks as well on S6.   I've switched back to Z2 from S6 edge, Moto X and HTC M8 so far. Z2 is just too good of a phone, the design could be better, but I think the Z3 has a better one, but doesn't offer enough for an upgrade. The Z4 or Z5 should be very good though. I hope they stay with 1080p as the QHD is not all that impressive, especially when your battery life depends on it."

Battery life is quite good, gets around 4-5 hours SOT in contrast to about 1,5 hours with the same usage pattern using the Nexus 4. Camera is actually really good in my opinion, but it might take a few shots in low light. Other than that it's a really great phone!"

I'd have the Nexus 6, if they made it the same size as the 4. I love my Nexus4.  iPhone is probably the most likely one, however I've got a real grudge with Apple. Beyond the phones and globalisation, I was with them before the iPod, and loved them, but have seen them turn into a selfish, profit-driven company. I'm also convinced that the Apple bubble will soon burst, and I don't think I want to be stuck in a contract when it happens (though it won't be a quick burst).  I've never had this problem before when upgrading a phone. I hope Google release a Nexus4 mkii!"

Even with all the technical parts being way better on this phone, I don't think that it feels much better than the nexus 4.

I love everything about my iPhone. The OS is fantastic (like Lollipop but more refined), and I just got a Mac yesterday so the integration is awesome (being able to send & receive texts/facetime on my computer). I love the phone by itself and the ecosystem in even better.  That said, the thing I didn't realize is that my Nexus 4 was the absolute perfect size. The iPhone screen is only like 0.2"" bigger, but it also has about a half in above & below the screen for the speaker and  home button and internals, so it's longer and skinner. If I'm holding it in the bottom corner, I can't reach the top left to go back on Reddit/Chrome. It's super annoying.

I just couldn't justify spending that much on the N6 and I've never been a Samsung fan.   Also FWIW my SO inherited the N4 and it's still going strong, the only issue is the poor battery life."

Camera is fantastic, battery is phenomninal, Sony hasn't fucked around too much with Lollipop. And best of all it is now possible to have root without unlocking the bootloader and losing the DRM keys. Performance is tip top and the size is perfect for me. I don't need a laptop in my pocket to make phone calls. The size is perfect. The screen is really, really nice. Maybe not perfect but no major issues with it. Micro SD slot is an absolute Godsend.   2 downsides I have to it:   Updates are slow to come out. I'm ok with this as Sony make sure they get it all working before bringing a major update. It does take a very long time though.  Make sure you get a magnetic charger for it. The flaps take a beating and 4 months after having mine my USB flap no longer stays closed. I need to get a replacement.    When you purchase it you absolutely  have to make sure the flaps don't open by themselves after 20 minutes. If you're paying the cash, take the time to check the phone before you agree to take it. If it remotely looks like it's opening, try another unit.   These 2 points are quite important to me, however they aren't deal breakers. I suppose if I was to do it again I would check my second point out more before buying the handset."

Within minutes, it went into sleep of death mode, and when I took it off, let it cool and restarted it, the same mounting position in front of heat caused another crash without warning.

nexus4,34o7rt,Krzysztof_Bryk,1 point,Sun May 3 08:35:53 2015 UTC,"A common cause for this (that I currently suffer) is noisy wifi.  I don't have control over my wifi network, and it's also quite large. This means there are a handful of devices which keep spamming broadcast messages. These wake my phone, and then the kernel goes ""Hang on, you were only asleep for seconds, lets wait a bit"".  The backoff increases exponentially, so instead of seeing 3 hours of wifi wakelock you see a small amount of something like qcom and lots of the kernel giving the wakelock the space it needs but isn't asking for.  I'm on a slightly older Chroma, but I had the same issue on stock.    However, you don't have wifi listed on your wakelocks.  Simply:  Every time your phones goes to sleep something is immediately waking it. The kernel reacts by adding a buffer, preventing the phone from constantly waking/sleeping/waking/sleeping every few milliseconds (draining even more battery)."
nexus4,34o7rt,BezierPatch,1 point,Sun May 3 14:19:17 2015 UTC,How did you fix the WiFi? I don't have control over my WiFi network. Turning off Wifi fixes the wakelock.

nexus4,34lstc,haelmchen,2,Sat May 2 08:33:16 2015 UTC,That depends on which way you rotate it into landscape mode. If you rotate it 90° clockwise the buttons move to what would be the top of the screen in portrait mode. Only if you rotate anti-clockwise do they stay in the same area.

nexus4,34bx5a,Aaaandiiii,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same spot. This phone got me spoiled flaws and all. I was all Moto X, but Sony's got me jonesing, but I have that concern too.

nexus4,34dpvs,sagaryvv,3,Thu Apr 30 09:08:01 2015 UTC,Go to recovery and clear cache. It might help.   Otherwise do the ota update manually by adb sideload method.
nexus4,34dpvs,amancarlos,2,Thu Apr 30 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"Did you root or at least flash a custom recovery on your Nexus 4?  If you did, I think that explains why the automatic update doesn't work. You will have to flash the update manually."

nexus4,34a5oq,1new_username,5,Wed Apr 29 14:55:26 2015 UTC,I'm in the exact same boat as you.  Based on various anecdotes in r/nexus4 I'm not at all confident that if I replace the battery it's going to make much of a difference.  I'm going to hold out for the next Nexus and reevaluate then.
nexus4,34a5oq,TheHandsOfFate,2,Wed Apr 29 15:28:24 2015 UTC,That's my thinking so far.  Maybe just ride it out and wait until it is time for a new phone.
nexus4,34a5oq,TheHandsOfFate,2,Wed Apr 29 16:14:19 2015 UTC,The list of decent sub-$350 Android phones is constantly growing; the landscape is much better than it was 3 years ago.  Right now there are 3 or 4 phones I could buy that I'd probably be fairly happy with.
nexus4,34a5oq,thanks_for_the_fish,3,Wed Apr 29 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is getting pretty good.  The main thing I hate is how huge they are all getting.  The N4 is already slightly too big for my hand with a case on.  My wife has the 2013 MotoX and I love the size.  I wish phone manufacturers would still make some 4"" or so screens for those of us that carry our phones in our pocket or like being able to use it with one hand."
nexus4,34a5oq,C0R4x,2,Wed Apr 29 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"Which ones? Do you think they compare well with the Nexus 4,5 or 6, or could you just live with them?"

nexus4,34a5oq,totalBS,2,Sat May 2 15:42:58 2015 UTC,When was the last time you did a factory reset or fresh install? A lot of battery problems are because of the software so before you start opening your phone up you should flash the factory images and see if that helps
nexus4,34a5oq,NeckbeardTheElder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:37:34 2015 UTC,"I sideloaded 5.0.1 and did a factory reset then.  I have sideloaded 5.1 since then without a factory reset, but I was having the shortened battery life with 5.0.1.  It isn't terrible, but it wasn't as good as it once was.  I just can't decide if I should take the risk with changing the battery or if I will just end up worse off than I am now."
nexus4,34a5oq,Nertez,2,Wed Apr 29 19:54:26 2015 UTC,I'd try to flash the factory image of 5.1 to start out with and then see if it does anything. Also see if an app is draining the battery by using something like better battery stats. I know someone who was having horrible battery on lollipop and it turns out a fitness tracking app was killing the battery and it just didn't do well on lollipop. Worth a look before you try another reset or battery replacement
nexus4,349e4v,sly2,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:11:17 2015 UTC,Look for a removal script in corresponding gapps page. Advanced users may inspect the updater-script inside gapps package & manually erase them from system.
nexus4,349e4v,lahirutarz,3,Wed Apr 29 12:39:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. But I ended up deleting the updater script and then dirty flashing the ROM. Seems to have done the trick, but my battery stats are going all wonky now.  Appreciate the reply."

(the pad, the stand, and the pillow)  In fact, the actual problem is the phone. The N4 isn't Qi-certified. It's never been labeled or marketed as a Qi compatible device by Google, and the official Orb was never labeled as a Qi charger. It just happened to be mostly compatible / loosely based on the standard.  In my personal experience with a DT-900, the phone will begin charging but is very finicky about placement. It will often stop charging just moments after placing it on the pad."

They're still looking into exactly what message it is but they think it might have to do with setting a data cap.   While some of the tricks people use (like switching to airplane mode, changing between 2G and 3G, etc) may work temporarily, the only true fix is to have your carrier block disabling cellular data signal, I.e. cellular data should always be enabled on their end regardless of what information they receive from the phone.

But most of the time those apps aren't using any CPU or anything else that would noticeably affect battery life.  They will stay in memory for a while, but that just helps Android load them fast when you go back to it.  Some apps will misbehave and have services running in the background that will affect battery life, but I don't think swiping them away will do much for the services, you're just swiping away activities.  I guess the moral of the story is, on your phone, only one Activity is running at a time, so swiping away other activities doesn't do a whole lot except make them slow to launch next time.  * In case you didn't know, long pressing the app icon in the Recents screen will take you to the App Info screen where you can forcefully kill it."

I read somewhere that just having the netflix app installed (don't have to use it) could cause SoD. I removed it and went from about one sod per day to none. That was 2 weeks ago. Installed the netflix app temporarily yesterday to watch something, left the app there to see if it really was the cause. And I'll be dammed already two SOD since then!  Just removed the app again.  But really a sandboxed app running in user mode shouldn't really be able to cause such issues. It has to be something that it does that triggers or has a chance to trigger a kernel/driver bug. So I suppose there could be other apps except the netflix app that causes the same problem.   So if you don't have netflix installed, try to remember any new app you may have installed when your problems started occuring."

It is definitely a software problem and not hardware.  I did remove just about all apps that I don't use and that helped some to where it is happening only every few days, but it does still happen.

It never finishes all the way and once it's interrupted there's no way to start it again.   It's really a pain. All I can say is, back up, back up in a second way, then back up your backups.

If I am sending from my google voice number, this option does not appear.    I have not used the standard ""Messaging"" app in quite a while, but from hangouts I have no issues sending pictures (although some recipients have reported the picture showed up as a ""link"" to a picture on the web) and group messaging works for me as long as I send from my carrier number, and not my google voice number."

The following thread seems relevant and I have starred it to track updates:  https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=160247  EDIT: I got group and picture MMS working today.  In my case, it had nothing to do with the link I posted.  Cricket changed their APN settings.  After putting in the updated settings, group/picture MMS started working.  I suggest checking your APN settings and make sure they are correct.  Flashing the factory image cleared all my APN settings, so the same may have happened to you."

Most times I've had it it's happened within a day of starting/rebooting the phone, if the phone makes it past there it just stays up like a champion.

The support Google has been offering the nexus devices has been sub par. When their is an issue like the camera bug, they should push an update  to the affected devices that fixes it. You shouldn't have to wait for the next version of the OS.  One of the biggest pros of a nexus device has been the speedy access to new OS versions. All the bugs that have been present in lollipop and the fact that some manufacturers  have been releasing updates before nexus devices makes that less of a pro.

nexus4,33l1yq,indrora,7,Thu Apr 23 18:53:29 2015 UTC,Your battery is probably dead. Download a battery checker to check your battery health and such.  Ampure was decent if I remember.   I think your battery just went to shit from sitting idle.
nexus4,33l1yq,FourForty,2,Thu Apr 23 11:59:13 2015 UTC,"I've used it for the better part of a week without issue... just poor battery life, that is about 1.75 hours of screen time.  Only after the upgrade has it really crapped the bed.  If it is the battery, I may explore replacing this, just to have this phone around as a backup.  I have to chuckle - I have the t-mobile app on there, the one that tracks your usage.  It reports that the battery is in excellent shape ;)  I would like to know how it arrives at that conclusion."
nexus4,33l1yq,itsadile,4,Thu Apr 23 12:12:10 2015 UTC,"I performed a clean flash of 5.1 the day the images were posted online. Aside from the system image version of Google Play services being a battery vampire, I've had no trouble with it, and even that GPS issue was resolved when the services updated themselves.  Perhaps try the clean flash. If the phone is still getting insanely hot after that and the Play Services update, you may have a hardware issue."
nexus4,33l1yq,TheHandsOfFate,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:42:14 2015 UTC,I'm planning on doing a clean flash tonight.  Can you explain your comment about Google Play services being a battery vampire?  Is it just a problem while it's updating?
nexus4,33l1yq,itsadile,3,Thu Apr 23 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"Google Play services 5.0.99, which I believe is what the 5.1 factory image comes with, was checking my location with excessive frequency. I lost about 30% of my battery's charge in an hour of travel, with Play Services listed as the top consumer of power. During that same period of time the screen was on for about two minutes."

If I can't find a permanent solution for this I'm going to roll back, since the new features are not worth the hassle"
nexus4,33l1yq,indrora,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"I get similar battery behavior after a camera crash.  The phone will crash with say 50% charge, but won't boot back up because it thinks the battery is empty.  I can boot it once it is plugged in, and after a full charge/discharge cycle it seems to sort itself out."
nexus4,33l1yq,NeckbeardTheElder,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"Had that happen once, back at the 4.4 update. Solution was to open it up and disconnect the battery for a few minutes. Let them caps drain. With the battery unplugged and the back off, plug in ac power. Try to boot. It shouldn't power up (didn't for me). Now plug the battery in, pop in ac power and let the boot loader charge the device. After 3...4 hours (I gave mine a full 24 like google suggested) pull it off AC and replace the back."
nexus4,33l1yq,sxehoneybadger,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds like something got fucked during the upgrade. What's your biggest battery usage, screen or something like Google Services? If Services is staying on churning through some error, it will eat up your battery, make your phone hot and take forever to charge.   I'd try a factory reset, and if that doesn't help, wipe and reinstall with Nexus Root Toolkit from scratch."

Battery was an issue at first but that was coming from gmail syncing my yahoo account, I removed the yahoo mail account and added their mail app and it's been all good since then.  Performance is faster and smoother than its been in months. No sleep of death 5-6 times a day. And the biggest thing so far (maybe just a coincidence, hopefully I'm not jinxing it) is that when I plug headphones/aux cord in the Google voice search doesn't keep randomly popping up.   tl;dr 5.1 saved my (phone's) life"
nexus4,33l1yq,gregm12,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:20:41 2015 UTC,5.1 seems to have fixed the reboot on my nexus 4. Feels faster n smoother than 5.0.x. Ram usage is lower than the nexus 5 running 5.1. Battery life is same as 4.4.4.
nexus4,33l1yq,deviousrich,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"I had this issue almost 2 years ago.  Felt like the CPU and GPU were locked at full speed.  Phone was always hot, and battery lasted maybe 2-3 hours with the screen off.  I sent it in for warranty, as nothing else helped."
nexus4,33l55o,lonaysta,3,Thu Apr 23 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"That's true, but FedEx and LG don't admit it. I talked to them several times and even submitted proofs, filed BBB claim but neither LG nor FedEx admitted to be responsible.   I sell things on eBay (electronics. I've sold several hard drives, tablets and laptops) so I know pretty well how to pack things safely, and N4 is such a fragile glass back phone. But I couldn't ""recording the packaging procedure and hold the camera all the way until I leave it to the drop off location"".  In fact I don't think FedEx is the one responsible for this. They could hardly break the phone given I packed it quite well. I still hold the guess that LG repair technician smashed the back of the phone on purpose so they could find an excuse and do this crazy thing to me."

nexus4,33l1ya,raggabomb,2,Thu Apr 23 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"I encrypted my phone several months ago using the stock rom, doing so does not wipe your data and takes approx 30-60mins to complete.  In terms of general performance, the phone didnt appear any slower running apps, playing games etc.  I also didnt notice any degraded battery performance.  However boot up times on the phone were significantly slower 3-4x and any operation that used a lot of IO writes, really lagged the phone.  Typically when i got google play store updates, doing so would make the phone almost unusable until they had completed."
nexus4,33l1ya,toy_town,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:25:45 2015 UTC,Oh man. I'm not that concerned about boot time but play store updates are heavy enough already... Now I don't know what to do
nexus4,33l1ya,itsadile,3,Thu Apr 23 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"Telling Play not to auto update might be a good idea in that case.

The only thing I'd be worried about would be the fact that your nexus will probably be 4 years old by the time it becomes open to the public and not just Nexus 6 owners.

With things like the M8, OnePlus One, G3 and Moto X all around the same price as the N5, it's just not as good of a deal."

nexus4,33hetl,GRAPE_FRUIT_EXTRACT,8,Wed Apr 22 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"It's barely an upgrade. The battery is bad (ask around in the n5 subreddit, 2hrs SOT seems to be the norm) the camera is just as average as the N4, and besides pure android it doesn't have much going for it. The moto x on the other hand provides a cool experience with all its little extras such as always on voice commands, the twist wrist camera activation and wave hand to wake up etc.   LG G2 is a battery monster, has a huge screen in a small body and a good size of storage...   I could go on..."
nexus4,33hetl,RacingGun,4,Wed Apr 22 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"Having owned both the N4 and the N5, I'm going to add a few things to this based on my experience.  The camera on the N5 is MUCH better than the N4 camera.  No, it's not amazing, but it definitely is better.  The image stabilization really helps.  The screen is definitely better as well... 1080p is visibly clearer and offers a much sharper image.  Overall, it is also just faster.  Every little thing you do is just faster.  Aside from that though, I think the N4 is very comparable to the N5, and even comes out ahead in terms of flashy looks (silver rim with rounded glass front and glass back with the sparkles beneath... drool).  *Edit: I should note that I made the upgrade 1 year ago.  If I had my N4 until today and was looking to upgrade, I would likely not pick the N5, because as other people said, there are better phones out there for a similar price.  Though being a Nexus device is a big plus to me, so it's a hard choice."

nexus4,33hetl,wasteland44,7,Wed Apr 22 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"At this point the N5 is an out of date phone. It's specs aren't bad, but I can't justify the price-tag for a phone that came out a year and a half ago.  Also, it's too big for me. I love my N4 because it's the right blend of a large screen size and fitting in my hand. The N5 and N6 just don't compare.."

I used this site for instructions: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-replace-the-nexus-4-battery-it-can-be-done-android/. It actually took me a few goes before I gathered up the courage to lodge the back off, it takes quite a bit of force. They recommend heating it to melt the glue, I just ripped it out and it's fine. A guitar pick is highly recommended!"
nexus4,33fdr0,_nivlac_,2,Wed Apr 22 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the back it a real pain to get loose.  I actually had one of those plastic ""spudger"" tools come with my new battery.

I almost lost one."
nexus4,33fdr0,zman0900,2,Wed Apr 22 04:24:16 2015 UTC,I'll second the guitar pick. I wasted a lot of time with other tools before going the guitar pick. Smooth sailing after that.

They must have put an excessive amount of glue on mine. Getting the case and various bits disconnected was incredibly easy.  When I put the new frame and screen in, I conveniently left the plastic backing on the battery section so the battery can be replaced easily, if need be."
nexus4,33fdr0,n0ia,2,Wed Apr 22 17:23:54 2015 UTC,"as everyone's saying, tis but an easy task.  The one bit of advice I can give comes from when I managed to get a battery from ebay that also came with the tools (two little plastic spudger/spacer tools).  When you're going round the edges trying to loosen the case I found the flat edge right by the corner was the best 'entry' point to get the spudger edge under the lip of the edge and gain a gap to work with.  Also AVOID spudging, prying round near the SIM tray.  it's only a thin bit of plastic on the body and will bend away.  Once you have the 3 edges all off you can unhook the sim tray edge with ease.  As peeps are saying, guitar pick; something that is wide, and won't put too much pressure on one point/area of the battery.  It's a gooey almost clay like thing so the more you can lift it as a big piece, the less curving/bending you'll introduce to the old one ( which shouldn't matter but thinking more about the new one should you ever need to open the case and go Dr Mario on it in future for other things).  Be careful of the white cable.  I found the biggest space to pry mine at from was the lower edge.   The Spudger proved the exactly shape to slip in under the edge of the battery to get it to slowly lift up and then as it got further I used a wider plastic tool.  The remanants of the previous glue will hold the battery down, so no need to worry about applying any new to keep the battery held down, I think.  Mine isn't jiggling around loose in the case as of today several months on and it was slightly easier, though still surprisingly difficult, to remove it when I did some other work on it a couple of months ago.   Lastly the little charging cable connecting to the motherboard.  I took two toohpicks and used their curvatures to gently get the cable to bend enough to fit in the rather slim gap between the top of the battery, motherboard, and back of case without being creased or crumpled when I screwed it all back together."
nexus4,33fdr0,wisejoeyd,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:44:33 2015 UTC,It can be done. Takes some patience at first try. Use a guitar pick or a credit card as the pry tool. Too much force breaks the silver bezel. ifixit guide is a good place to start.

Tip, start at the bottom of the phone and find a YouTube video that explains exactly where the catches are. Makes it much easier.  I just levered the battery out with a guitar pick type thing that came with a cheap toolkit. No heat applied and it was a bit scary when the battery started bending but it popped out with a bit of patience"

Don't know if anyone else has experienced it, but I only noticed it once I got my Pebble a little while back and I noticed from time to time RunKeeper info wouldn't update for 20, 30 seconds, and button presses for pause/resume wouldn't be communicated. I had seen a similar thing with my Fitbit One from time to time, but I was more apt to attribute that to the extreme low power of the device and that I was in an area with a lot of 2.4GHz noise."

If you flashed it frozen it was fine as wine, flashed it warm and it had endless fc's and crashes etc.) I wondered if keeping the n4 out of it's quite snug case would help it with temperature regulation a little.

I still get a weird YouTube thing where it will load forever or keep telling me there's an error.

If you can't connect to your PC, I'm not sure how you are going to backup your files... As for wiping, you could probably wipe and reinstall a couple of the partitions from recovery, but not all. For example, you could wirelessly push the 5.1 .img files for your radio, system, data, etc. to your device, but I don't think you can install the recovery.img file through your custom recovery...  I know that there are some apps that allow you to ADB wirelessly. Never tried them, so I cannot say if they would work.

nexus4,33c08l,CrayolaOblongata,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:50:09 2015 UTC,How is the battery life of the moto x? I am looking into upgrading and the moto x is on my list. However I'm getting really tired of the horrible battery life of the n4 and I've heard rumors that the moto x has comparable battery life.
nexus4,33c08l,krotz,3,Tue Apr 21 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"It has a better battery life, but its not EXTREMELY better. My N4 usually died before I went to sleep, whereas now I'm at about 20% when I fall asleep.  However Motorola does sell a Turbo Charger which gives it 8 hours of battery life in a 15 minute charge, so if battery is a huge concern, that charger may be a good idea."

nexus4,33c08l,puffinlab,5,Tue Apr 28 07:40:46 2015 UTC,I went for a One Plus One after my nexus 4 and it is definitely a worthwhile upgrade.

nexus4,33c08l,zzisrafelzz,3,Tue Apr 21 15:19:31 2015 UTC,S6 hands down.
nexus4,33c08l,Guticb,3,Tue Apr 21 11:01:19 2015 UTC,"What is the requirement for the camera? Are you looking to take fast pictures, do video recording, take vibrant pictures? Each camera has its specific uses that make it stand out the best. The safe bet is the S6, but then if you use the camera function a lot: are you comfortable handling the storage limitation of the S6? Would you be willing to use cloud storage? Since you did use a Nexus 4: I assume the lack of removable batteries aren't an issue.  I travel a lot and I use my Note 2 often for picture taking with family, friends that fits the entire spectrum (video recording, HDR photos, and so on; often having a spare battery and SD card on-hand. All too often I see people's batteries die on them because they underestimated their camera's power efficiency and end up taking less pictures/video as a result which can only be bad for preserving memories. But if you're not that heavy into taking pictures then I may be overestimating your usage, by which the S6 is the safest bet.  However the LG phones are no slouch at taking pictures either and I'm always impressed by fast-focus times their laser modules provide that I would possibly consider and as a camera hobbyist myself. I would personally wait and see what the competition from LG, Kodak, and Saygus come out with before putting down flagship money. The worst that can happen is that you buy now and regret it. Is there no possibility of investing in a used phone to tide you over or does this absolutely have to be done? If so, then consider the pictures from the HTC M9(with the updated software patch) and match that against the S6 and make your decision then. You have to find out what you like in your pictures: do you want vibrant pictures? Do you value color accuracy? Do you value fast shutter-speed? Do you value low-light shots?   Despite what ads would have you believe, there's a hard limit between having good low-light shots and having fast shutter-speed and vibrancy because of the physical limits of your camera sensor: you can't have both unless you're fine with post-processed pictures 100% of the time(which is often handled by the camera software). If I am overestimating you on this, then disregard everything and just go with the S6."
nexus4,33c08l,WhatWasWhatAbout,2,Tue Apr 21 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation a couple of months ago, and I went with the M8. I've absolutely loved it so far!   The biggest requirement I have for a phone is to be unlockable. And since I was going to get an AT&T variant of whichever phone I choose, I couldn't get a Samsung. I'm glad I ended up with the M8, because I'm not big on pictures, and everything else about the phone is perfect."
nexus4,33c08l,kvaks,2,Tue Apr 21 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Unlockability is a top priority for me, too. And camera means nothing. I was thinking the Nexus 6 was likely to be next for me, despite the unappealing price tag, but I will consider HTC."

nexus4,33c08l,c190,2,Tue Apr 21 18:38:35 2015 UTC,Sony Xperia Z3 or the Z3 Compact. It has what you need. A 2 day battery life and has a really good camera. Also it is waterproof. The only thing that might bug you is that it doesn't have Lollipop yet. I would have recommend the Z4 but apparently the Z4 doesn't have a 2 day battery life since Sony didn't brag about it during the launch.

This is a utility that automates many of these tasks for you, such as backups & restores, flashing roms, rooting, OTA sideloads, etc.  I don't know what's wrong with your OTA update. However, if you are still having problems with the OTA sideload, the next thing to do would be to flash the 5.1 Factory image. This will erase all of your data, but it will do a clean install of 5.1, meaning any bugs are facing now would be eliminated. You can backup your data if you want (using the Nexus Root Toolkit, click on backup option, and backup whatever settings you like; just don't do a Nandroid backup). Then Unlock the bootloader using the tool, and finally click on the flash stock option. This should automatically download the 5.1 factory image and flash it. You can restore your apps after this is done.  Be sure to read all of the pop-ups and instructions if you decide to use the Nexus Root Toolkit :)"

I'm starting to seriously suspect it's Google Play Services that's causing this, because just the other day I cleared the data for it and rebooted and then immanently got a SOD after months of not having one.

nexus4,337vl0,sinetwo,6,Mon Apr 20 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, very much interested in this as well.  Things i've discovered so far...  Pros:   Spec wise it seems like a step up across the board Battery life is supposed to be excellent. Sony haven't ruinedadded-value-to the OS too much, and adding nova launcher or whatever fixes most of what they have done. It's just slightly smaller, which i think is perfect for me being able to reach the top left corner (where lots of buttons appear to be under ""material"").   Cons:   I have the nexus wireless charger, and Sony do their own proprietary magnetic thing (which is, admittedly supposed to be ok).  So if you have the wireless charger, you're going to have to shelf it. ???   I'd appreciate any other pros/cons from folk.  For instance, the pull down quick-menu is often ruined by phone manufacturers.  How is it on the z3c (specifically with lollipop)?"
nexus4,337vl0,MrSplog,3,Mon Apr 20 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"Your pros and cons are exactly what you can expect in reality, I upgraded from my n4 to a z3c in December. I really like the phone, camera is great and battery life is awesome (my n4 lasted about 18 hrs with slight usage, and this thing easily lasts 36 hrs with medium-heavy usage. A nice touch are the battery saving modes that further extend the battery life. For example when I had 15% on my n4, I knew I should get a charger in the next hour or else the phone is dead (even in standby). 15% for the z3 means still a lot of usage or leaving it in standby overnight and still having enough battery left. In the ""ultra stamina mode"" it still lasts 1-2 days with 15% battery.  The UI is nice, I installed the aosp keyboard and the nexus launcher, so my day to day usage is almost vanilla. The other small things that Sony changed are mostly useful, no big complaints here.  The phone feels smaller than the nexus, although the display is the same size (I think). You can see this as a pro or a con. The hardware as a whole is also really nice, the waterproofing works and is a nice add-on.   But somehow the phone lacks something special. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure you remember when you unboxed your nexus 4 and you were excited for at least a whole week. This phone doesn't have this feeling. It just works, but it doesn't really stand out. It does spec-wise, but still. I hope you get what I mean. Overall I'd still prefer the nexus 4 form factor and the vanilla android. For everything else, the z3c is superb. I'd still buy the z3c again, but only for the lack of good alternatives. If there was a revamped nexus 4, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Still the best phone I ever had."

I actually prefer the Z3C form factor, the perfect size for holding in my hand.  The N4 wasn't bad, this just feels slightly better and more phone-like in my hand.  I'd say unboxing/newness feeling of the Z3C was there for me, I love the camera button for example--that point and shoot feeling.  I do prefer vanilla android, but I like the battery saving features Sony provides.  The battery life in general helps me enjoy the phone without worrying about it.  This phone has pretty much filled in all the cons of the N4 without making cons of its own (I would prefer QI over the propriety charging, but it's a small gripe).  The specialness lacking compared to the N4 might just be the groundbreaking nature of the N4, it was when Android became usable/desired IMO."

I am very fractionally disappointed with the screen (literally a teeny tiny bit). You can see the individual pixels occasionally and I never felt like that with the Nexus 4.  The magnetic charger is great and charges quickly. The battery life is amazing. SD Card is brilliant especially now that lollipop supports write to SD.   You have to wait a while for updates but I'm ok with that, I'd rather they get it right.   Camera is amazing, much better than the Nexus 4.   Waterproofing is great. Watch out for the doors when you buy it. Take it out the box and leave it for 15 minutes or so to see if the doors pop out on their own. If they do get another handset and test that one.   I miss root though and custom ROMs, I'll be looking to do that soon but it will require a factory reset that I don't massively want to do.   I think that's the most of it.

nexus4,3389dg,zenpunk32,2,Sat May 9 00:37:09 2015 UTC,Choose 'LTE/GSM auto(PRL)' instead of 'LTE only'.This way your phone will switch to other networks when you're at a place with no LTE.

nexus4,333jjc,forthewin0,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about how the flashing process actually works... All I know is that the Nexus Root Toolkit does it for you automatically. Doing this will erase pretty much all partitions and reformat them with the factory image, so yeah, you will lose all your data. Nexus Root Toolkit has backup and restore options. You can use it to backup SMS messages, call logs, normal apps, system apps, app data, apn settings, etc. I suggest that for software upgrades, you don't do a Nandroid backup & restore using TWRP though (it's an option in the Nexus Root Toolkit)."
nexus4,332z9t,hheartstrongg,3,Sun Apr 19 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"If this is your first time doing this and you want a working phone quickly, use the Nexus Root Toolkit. It automatically does everything you would need: Backups + Restores, OTA Sideloads, ROM + Nexus Factory Image flashes, Push + Pull Files, Rooting + Unrooting, Unlocking + Locking, etc...  Getting the drivers set up the first time takes a few minutes, but after that, you should be good to go. There is an option for Sideloading the OTA update, but I personally would just flash the 5.1 factory image (will lose all of your data though). You can make a backup if you are concerned about losing your data."
nexus4,332z9t,forthewin0,2,Sun Apr 19 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"Not concerned at all about losing my data, I've back it all up in preparation for this. Thank you so much, but just to confirm do I need to root my phone to use that toolkit? If I don't have to I'd rather not (it's not something I can see myself playing with)"
nexus4,332z9t,forthewin0,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"Looking at the options right now:   Sideloading OTAs works on both Locked and Unlocked devices. Flashing the factory image works only on Unlocked devices.   By saying unlocked above, I am talking about the Bootloader being unlocked. This erases all of your data, but after you unlock your device once, you never have to unlock it again, even after flashing other ROMs or updates. The toolkit has an option for automatically unlocking the bootloader, so if you want to flash the factory image, do that first. You do not have to be rooted for any of these options."

nexus4,32zezh,bugolf,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:34:16 2015 UTC,You'll need to flash the stock radio image and then the stock recovery before you can apply the 5.0.1 and 5.1 OTAs through ADB sideload. After you are on 5.1 you can get a new hybrid radio image from the Nexus 4 forums on XDA developers and flash that through TWRP or CWM. You may need to dial ##info## or whatever to reselect LTE or do that sqlite thing. On my phone I haven't rebooted since enabling LTE so I don't know yet if I will need to use sqlite to make the LTE persist across reboots.
nexus4,32zezh,AnEmuCat,3,Sat Apr 18 01:49:58 2015 UTC,"The factory images are out now, so he could also directly flash the 5.1 images."

nexus4,32xvlq,RambleMan,9,Fri Apr 17 16:52:39 2015 UTC,I think the N4 showed us that Google literally can't update our phones. Don't want countless flaws? You need a fresh install.
nexus4,32xvlq,Pxorp,7,Fri Apr 17 22:41:06 2015 UTC,"With my 2012 N7 I did a factory refresh of 5.0 after the OTA made it useless. Still didn't help, so I did a nuke and pave. Didn't help.  What's clear to me is that Google doesn't adequately test their OS updates before pushing them out. With all the trouble the N4 in particular has had with Lollipop, I think Google should've stopped us at 4.4.4 for OTA updates so only people wanting to force Lollipop have to manually do it.  Not all Android users know or want to know about flashing, ROMs, etc. I'm one of those people who just wants a stable device with the official/stock version."
nexus4,32xvlq,_nivlac_,3,Fri Apr 17 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"I factory reset my Nexus 4 on 5.0.1, didn't help anything. Still get the black screen of death, battery issues (after buying a new battery a couple of months before), weird signal issues, videos not playing, and odd errors that should have been ironed out, but weren't."
nexus4,32xvlq,Humanboeing,10,Sat Apr 18 13:39:34 2015 UTC,"I'd gone back to 4.2.0 because everything else, everything later was unusable shit on the n4. 4.2.0 was stable but I thought I'd give 5.1 a go.  I flashed from the factory image not via ota and it has been smooth and flawless, honestly, since then.  The N4 actually seems like a very good phone now. Fingers very crossed, obviously."
nexus4,32xvlq,tajoegg,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:25:53 2015 UTC,Hmm which 4.2 ROM do you recommend?  I am also sick and tired of camera reboot bug on 4.4.4 and Lollipops. I purchased my Nexus 4 during its Kitkat time so I have no idea which 4.2 Roms to use.  Thanks

nexus4,32xvlq,tylerrobb,3,Fri Apr 17 22:02:17 2015 UTC,If you're not completely wiping your device and installing the 5.1 factory image from https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images then you're way more likely to have a bad time...
nexus4,32xvlq,eighteesix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:44:55 2015 UTC,cant you only do that using an unlocked device?
nexus4,32xvlq,tylerrobb,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:08:02 2015 UTC,Yes you will need to unlock your bootloader. This is perfectly safe but will wipe your device. If you ever need to re-lock your phone that's easy too.  These instructions should help you: http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/general/how-to-how-to-flash-factory-image-t2010312
nexus4,32xvlq,nkzuz,2,Sat Apr 18 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Did you wipe your data?   I'm using an unofficial build of cm12 (temasek's, 5.0) and it's been working quite ok. Haven't tried 5.1 yet."
nexus4,32xvlq,paradoxofchoice,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:13:09 2015 UTC,I wiped data/did a clean install to force my N4 back to 4.4.4 from 5.0.1 which made the device unreliable. Yesterday I allowed an automatic OTA update to 5.0.1 and immediately 5.1 without manual intervention/data wiping.
nexus4,32xvlq,paradoxofchoice,0,Fri Apr 17 20:53:02 2015 UTC,So you didn't actually perform a clean install of 5.1 from the factory image.
nexus4,32xvlq,crushhawk,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:51:37 2015 UTC,"Correct, as stated in my original posting."
nexus4,32xvlq,magicbookwerm,-1,Sat Apr 18 17:03:31 2015 UTC,So you basically took the route that would present the most problems for you. It's always best to just flash a clean wipe from the latest factory image.
nexus4,32xvlq,LantianTiger,3,Sat Apr 18 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"I took the route presented by the device/tech mega-giant that developed the software.  I agree that for the cleanest experience I should do a flash a clean wipe, but I shouldn't have to step outside of the automated consumer experience to have a functioning device.  It would probably be best for me to have my truck's engine rebuilt every six months rather than just doing spring/fall service, but that's not a reasonable expectation on the consumer."

nexus4,32xxls,aero25,15,Fri Apr 17 17:07:17 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the S6 is the best camera right now. A higher megapixel count doesn't mean its better. Look at S6 reviews and sample shots

nexus4,32xxls,dmanww,9,Sat Apr 18 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, megapixels are a red herring for sure. It's all about focus speed right now.  edit: and lower light performance."
nexus4,32xxls,iNoles,8,Fri Apr 17 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"I recently switched to the Z3C (compact model), which is slightly smaller than the N4 (only .1 inch screen smaller screen though).  It's pretty much the only ""normal"" sized phone with flagship specs these days.  The battery life has been amazing so far, so much so it's thrown off my previous nightly charging routine (currently at 60% after 2d1h of mild use w/2h+ screen on time), this was even with some spotty mobile coverage involved.  It also has nice battery saver support on top of that for when it gets really low.  It definitely lived up to the hype on that front.  The camera is good, but not as good as the 20MP would make you believe, it's just above average and can be hit or miss--not great (still ridiculously better than the N4 obviously, and doesn't reboot the phone which is nice heh).  The physical camera button on the Z3C is a nice touch, it feels just like a point and shoot where you can quickly pull it out of your pocket and hit the button and snap a picture.  It also has wireless charging (though proprietary/non-QI, which is annoying), it would be hard to go back to USB plugging all the time again after the N4.  It's also waterproof, though I don't plan to take it under water, I like not having to worry about it in the rain.  This is subjective, but the feel in hand is perfect for a phone while still having a decent sized screen, if you want to join the giant phone craze the Z3/Note/N6 might be better for you.  I regret nothing, once it went under $400 on amazon I had to bite the bullet.  It's got a lot of things going for it."

nexus4,32xxls,Pxorp,3,Fri Apr 17 18:31:23 2015 UTC,My Oneplus One camera is terrible and slow (CM12 nightlies with cyanogen camera app).
nexus4,32xxls,Pxorp,6,Fri Apr 17 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"Slow? I've had the phone for only 2 days, but the camera is so much faster than the nexus 4. I'm loving it so far!"
nexus4,32xxls,bubblegoose,2,Fri Apr 17 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe CM12 nightlies is the problem, but it takes its sweet time to focus even in good light. Even when tapping to pre-focus, it is still very slow.   Maybe I need to mess around with more of the modes, but this camera is not much better than my Nexus 4 in my experience."
nexus4,32xxls,linh_nguyen,2,Fri Apr 17 23:01:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is interesting. Does the 1+1 have a proprietary driver that nerfs the capability when you start messing with the OS? I've seen it mentioned about other devices, but seems counter to what the 1+1 is supposed to be about."
nexus4,32xxls,phillium,2,Fri Apr 17 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yea, I haven't done anything to the phone, so it's total stock."
nexus4,32xxls,phillium,2,Fri Apr 17 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"If money isn't the issue, go to the next store and get what you like the most in your hands. I'd get the G3 or Z2, though. The new flagships cost at least twice as much and honestly, you won't see the huge speed improvements we had in the early 2010s. If you really need the camera, you probably are better off with the G4, S6, Z4."
nexus4,32xxls,sparkey2439,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"Not quite double, but closeish. It looks like the G3 is going for ~$450usd right now brand new. I did play with the G3, M9 and Z3. Sadly, the store I was at had a non-operable GS6, so no comparison there. G3 camera was the best, hands down, in the course of my ~10 minute demo. Hoping for some more people with longer than my 10 min experience to chime in. Thanks for the comment!"
nexus4,32xxls,duluoz1,2,Fri Apr 17 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, so here is my personal experience: Z2 beats the G3 in low light when there is movement but overall I'd say the G3 cam is better. G3 is also kinda laggy, my N4 might load things slower but rarely lags in comparison to my brother's G3. Too much crap added.   I recommend you read the reviews, some of them go into sooo much detail, on the other hand you get lots of bias here."
nexus4,32xxls,jrwn,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:37:31 2015 UTC,Interesting. Do you know which G3 your brother has? I think the AT&T model has less ram than the T-Mobile model (D851).
nexus4,32xxls,jellystones,2,Fri Apr 17 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"European Version, 2GB of ram. Even the pull down bar is laggy. I guess the high resolution, fitness tracker and all kinds of added stuff don't help either. Still, the best device for the money. They regularly sell the 3GB/32GB version for 300€ on amazon warehousedeals without any flaws."
nexus4,32xxls,Maximusplatypus,2,Sat Apr 18 01:12:43 2015 UTC,"I imported an Asus Zenfone 2 via Ebay. If you are looking for camera performance, the Zenfone 2 is really good. The camera is fast and has a ""night owl"" mode. For about $250 without a contract, it is worth checking out.    Plus it has a microSD card slot and a 3,000 mAH battery"
nexus4,32xxls,Maximusplatypus,2,Sat Apr 18 01:08:00 2015 UTC,"Pricewise, probably the 1+1. Camera wise, the S6 seems to have that hands down. G3 may be the best balance if you can get a good price on it.  Sony is in limbo land for me. At the cost of a z3, i'd just get an S6.  I've read the camera is great.. .but has more bouts of random oddity to it."

nexus4,32vl6n,davedaverave,0,Fri Apr 17 08:11:19 2015 UTC,Are you using some sort of region unlocking?  The new netflix apps have google's dns hardcoded and won't work unless you block them. I had exactly the same issue as you today on all android devices 2x 5.1 and one 5.0.2 in the house.  I blocked google's dns on the router because my girlfriend was complaining about netflix crashing. That did it.   Are you in europe? Since we both had it happening today.  I have since read that if you downgrade your netflix app to version 3.7.1 (the one before they implemented hardcoded dns adresses) if you need a quick fix :)
nexus4,32vl6n,cptidiealot,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:32:45 2015 UTC,Is blocking the google dns something you'd need dd-wrt or tomato for?

nexus4,32txbj,PM_ME_A_NEW_USERNAME,3,Thu Apr 16 18:05:53 2015 UTC,You can't take the OTA if you're rooted with Xposed. You will need to flash the factory image instead.  No need to unroot (you'll just reroot afterward) but previously you were required to uninstall Xposed before flashing the factory image. Not sure what that process is like these days.  If you've never flashed a factory image there are plenty of guides if you do some googling.  Just make sure you don't flash userdata (so you keep your data) and that you do wipe the cache (so you don't get bootloops) when you're finished.

nexus4,32txbj,dark79,3,Thu Apr 16 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"It actually means you have to re-flash as uninstalling apps still leaves the system partition modified.

nexus4,32t6to,atheismthrowaway0,6,Thu Apr 16 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Go ahead and unlock the bootloader and root it before you start setting things up. Whenever you decide to root, it'll wipe your device; might as well do it early.  Get Wugfresh Nexus Root Toolkit and install it on your computer. Great tool.  Get some protection for it. I like a tempered glass screen protector and a dbrand skin, because I rarely ever drop my phone. A case is a good idea if you drop occasionally; Ringke Slim, Ringke Fusion, or Diztronic TPU are all great cases."
nexus4,32t6to,NeckbeardTheElder,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"Damn, everyone's like 'root it', but I just don't want to. Is it that bad, the stock experience? I know it sounds a bit rude but I just don't understand what the fuss is about. On the other hand, I don't know what I'm missing, I only tried stock."
nexus4,32t6to,ZorbaTHut,5,Thu Apr 16 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind ""root it"" and ""change the experience"" are two different things entirely.  First, unlocking the bootloader allows you to replace the entire experience or root the phone. It also wipes the entire phone. There is no way to get around this.  Rooting it allows you to bypass some of the security and do things which you generally aren't allowed to do . . . like run backups, or run low-level utilities. Replacing the ROM allows you to entirely change how the phone works.  So let's imagine you choose not to unlock the bootloader, and later, you want to make a copy of your save in a game you've been playing a lot. But the game doesn't have a built-in way to do this. Sorry! You're boned. Can't do it.  But if you do choose to unlock the bootloader, then you want to make a copy of that save, you can finish the rooting process and just do so. You won't have to change your experience in any way.  So, tl;dr:  Unlock the bootloader now, 'cause you can't do it easily later. It will not change how the phone behaves in any other way. It's just a thing you should automatically do. And if you want to root it in the process, you won't hurt anything by doing so, it just gives you the option to run root-only programs."
nexus4,32t6to,NeckbeardTheElder,2,Thu Apr 16 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not bad. I haven't rooted mine yet, stock is fine. But every other phone and tablet, including two nexuses, I have, and it's nice. It opens up a lot more apps and control.  I guess it's better to say, if you're going to root it, go ahead now before you get everything set up like you like it.  Edit: I should also say that NRT is good for a lot more than just rooting. Recovering a brick, installing drivers, push/pull files, etc."
nexus4,32t6to,Deam,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Mine 2 year old N4 still has locked bootloader and stock rom, and I'm really happy with it. Sure there are some bugs that could be possibly fixed with flashing custom kernel or whole rom, so it may be good for you to at least unlock bootloader, but for me, stock is generally fine. If you do not need specific feature of custom rom/kernel or root, then you shouldn't flash/root it, at least in my opinion."

If it still doesn't flash, you can extract the flashable zip and simply copy the apk to /system/priv-app/ and set the proper permissions.    Oh word of advice, backup the apps in titanium backup before you remove them because some cause FCs if they're removed from /system.

And if you're looking into the used market, mind that the battery life was one of the 4's main caveats since launch, it wont be stellar in any way, depending on how used it was, you may need to replace it and since you're not experienced ""with this"", it's not an easy job.  I've had mine as my daily driver for a while now, and I still think it's a solid (and gorgeous!) phone, even though it's old. Really old in smartphone age, so don't expect most new features to work on it. There are Lollipop bugs, but in my case, I haven't found any critical ones.

nexus4,32ndkv,Glenn2000,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:47:11 2015 UTC,You will need to restore your recovery after the flash in fastboot mode (reboot with power + vol dn).  fastboot flash recovery twrp-2.8.6.0-mako.img    Boot into it after you have reinstalled and sideload the updated-supersu 2.46.zip from TWRP -> advanced -> adb sideload.  adb sideload UPDATE-SuperSU-v2.46.zip    You also need the newest adb 1.0.32 for this (at least I did on mac).  You'll find all these files by googling :)

So the procedure described by Glenn2000 is accurate. You just need to remove the '-w' from last fastboot line. If the procedure fails at system.img just unpack the archive and flash manually one by one this files:  fastboot flash boot boot.img fastboot flash system system.img fastboot flash recovery recovery.img  Thanks for help Glenn2000."

nexus4,32ny5r,Jxrd,3,Wed Apr 15 09:36:22 2015 UTC,Damn that sucks. It honestly looks like CyanogenMod did Google's job in fixing the camera reboot bug.  They should just take the code from CM12 for the Nexus 4 in regards to the camera.
nexus4,32ny5r,Omnibitent,3,Wed Apr 15 14:40:33 2015 UTC,Is this bug is fixed in CM12?
nexus4,32ny5r,a3Dman,2,Thu Apr 16 03:56:35 2015 UTC,CyanogenMod did Google's job in fixing the camera reboot bug   Source?
nexus4,32ny5r,deleteme123,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:12:32 2015 UTC,Well just from using the CM camera my phone didn't reboot as opposed to stock where I could only open the camera app and get a reboot.
nexus4,32ny5r,Omnibitent,3,Fri Apr 17 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why it seems to effect some people and not others. 4.4.3 and prior I had no camera errors or problems. But 4.4.4 was hell. Rebooted all time after a few pictures taken. 5.0 was better, 5.01 was plagued with horrible camera reboots again.   After much trail and error. In my opinion its software related. I believe it has some thing to do with nu player being a default player under the the developers settings. I unchecked the nu player cleared the cache and now use awesome player. Every day I've been taking fifteen plus pictures and only seem to have had maybe a hand full of reboots in months as to oppose a reboot after third or fourth picture taken.   My question for you guys is, do you know if there is a option to toggle between nu player and awesome player under the developer settings in 5.1?"
nexus4,32ny5r,Captain_Snowcone,2,Wed Apr 15 14:42:34 2015 UTC,Nah I've unchecked it and nothing changed with the frequency of reboots. Also why would the media player have any affect on the camera?
nexus4,32ny5r,Staying_Anon,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"Alone just changing the player default didn't help out. I had to clear both the cache with in the phone( I used ccleaner) and through the recovery.  My theory is the camera will crash with nu player enabled, once one crash has happened it throws a error, corrupt file etc into the system that gets accessed, crashing the camera again and again. Cleaning the cache removes the error or said corrupted file allowing it to run better.  Once again these are all theories from loads of trail and error. But has made a huge improvement to my phone.  As for the media player. Its used for a lot things, ie any media."
nexus4,32ny5r,Captain_Snowcone,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yes there is this option and it seems to be on ""use AwesomePlayer"" by default. Can anyone confirm this please ? I may have changed this before but I don't think I did."
nexus4,32ny5r,Captain_Snowcone,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:41:15 2015 UTC,As far as I know nu player becomes default around when 4.4.4 was rolled out. You have to toggle it off. Once you have changed it back to the original awesome player it'll stay on even when reboots are done unlike some of the other developer settings.
nexus4,32og8s,Abbekeff,6,Wed Apr 15 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"So, what does that mean for us? That the nexus 4 is old and the nexus 6 has better power management? That's not really a surprise.

nexus4,32ocbd,speakxj7,2,Wed Apr 15 16:44:18 2015 UTC,There is another possibility that your device may be unlocked but not rooted. In this case you just have to flash a custom recovery like TWRP and flash SuperSU. It won't lose any data on your phone.
nexus4,32ocbd,lahirutarz,4,Wed Apr 15 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"no.  Unlocking the device will factory reset it, and unlocking is required to gain root.  But just turn on app backups in settings and backup your sms and you wont lose much."

You can use adb backup, root and then restore. This wont backup your texts or call log, I think, though."
nexus4,32o5gf,SuperIngamer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:33:37 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the finding of a replacement, unfortuntely.  But I can explain the difference between regular and gorilla glass.  Gorilla Glass has been specially chemically treated to give the glass itself both more flex strength (won't crack under a certain amount of pressure from a flexing action), and scratch resistance.  It also has a certain level of shatter resistance from impact, but this is largely due to the previous two factors mentioned combining.  Once gorilla glass is scratched, the likelyhood of a fracture or crack is put on the same par as regular glass, since the structure has been compromised.  that doesn't mean it will break in your pocket, just that it isn't as resilient any longer.  If you are careful with your phone in general, have a case and a screen protector on it, and don't drop it, then a regular glass screen will serve you fine.  if you run your phone naked, keep it in your pocket with keys/coins/other sharp objects, or toss it around/have butter fingers, then you are going to want to get one with official gorilla glass rather than traditional glass."

nexus4,32hdwv,stef_t97,3,Tue Apr 14 17:27:02 2015 UTC,OTA typically gets sent out before factory images go up.

nexus4,32ghfm,lonaysta,8,Mon Apr 13 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"That has always struck me as strange. If you're going to do a phased rollout of an update, it seems like voluntarily allowing power users to download and install the factory image ahead of the deployment could catch some of the simple obvious problems that have plagued Android releases in the past."
nexus4,32ghfm,vinsnob,8,Mon Apr 13 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"Left hand, right hand, etc."
nexus4,32ghfm,lonaysta,2,Mon Apr 13 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"It makes sense, actually. Phased rollout is a nice way yo give a statistically random selection of users with a statistically random usage pattern the OTA. This means users who raise a fuss are easy to spot and you aren't going to burn any bridges.   Think of it like this: if Apple releases a new version of iOS and it has huge problems due to an oversight in the development process, it kills trust. However, by using the phased rollout (and Apple's closed system betas) they iron out a lot of bugs before going final.  Likewise, Factory images are final, completed, ""this is the canonical version"" builds that are the standard to work against. The emulator has had an image for a long while because it has a limited feature set with a known environment. It can be tested by a machine.   Tl;Dr phones are complex. Software engineering is harder."

Ha, seriously?! It is totally a problem, a serious one at that. If this happens to your phone, then you can miss calls, alarms, and messages because this can happen at any moment. Imagine an emergency situation and your phone won't respond because of this or the muted call audio bug. I luckily found a workaround for the SoDs with the wake lock manager app, but come on."

nexus4,32i0x8,wangcarbonus,3,Thu Apr 16 06:54:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I've experienced two - one on each device - since flashing the OTA update for 5.1.  One device went several hours without an issue (though it was plugged in overnight, with the setting to keep the screen on while charging left enabled). It went to sleep and never awoke ~20 minutes after being removed from the power outlet this morning. A forced reboot was required.  The other Nexus 4 went about an hour and a half after the update completed last night before also experiencing the sleep of death, and failing to awake.  In an over all land of improvements and fixes (though I cannot speak to the issue of no audio in a phone call as of yet), this is unfortunately disappointing.  I'm now considering a full factory reset, though I'm wondering if I should even bother considering I don't know for sure that it will resolve the issue. I only know that I never had a problem with the sleep of death prior to 5.0 (though I know others have reported it). It's a shame, I like 5.x, but this is brutal."
nexus4,32i0x8,Dr_Midnight,5,Fri Apr 17 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"The 5.01 OTA brought major Sleep of Death issues to me; it was bad enough that after a couple weeks (and  a particularly bad weekend) I flashed the full factory image.   After flashing fresh, I significantly reduced the problem from 'oh man, do I need to buy a new phone?' to 'huh, it's been 3 weeks since it last did that.' 8/10 would flash factory again - in fact I'll probably sit back and let the early adopters do the testing for me, then flash a factory image when I'm ready (assuming 5.1 isn't horribly broken)."
nexus4,32i0x8,cuteintern,3,Tue Apr 14 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"I never had it before 5.0.1 either. Granted, it wasn't on 5.0 long.  Edit: I only did factory flash without wipes though (so essentially same as OTA)."

Pulling down the notification shade, swiping over to Google Now, and locking the device all feel consistently smooth now.  The recent apps stack is faster to navigate. Camera loads faster. Memory usage seems to be reasonable.  Very happy with 5.1 so far. The only thing that bugs me is the very low frame rate on the front facing camera preview (been like this since 5.0). If no nasty surprises turn up (sleep of death, camera reboots...), then this is the best release so far for this phone IMO. Android 4.x wasn't perfect either- I had problems with wireless charging wakelocks and home button lag; both of which are resolved now."

nexus4,32ito9,spartyboy33,3,Tue Apr 14 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"How much did you get it for? Because most of the appeal of the Nexus 4 has started to disappear, its update cycle is soon ending, it is still fast but just that you'll have to rely on ROMs for further updates. And the rise of 64bit in the future will also affect its performance (I'm guessing). You could get a used Nexus 5 for about $250 on eBay, or even a 2014 flagship for a little more.   But if you think it was the right decision, then great! I bought a used one myself last year in March and it's still going strong.

In your opinion, would you go for a new Nexus 4 or a used Nexus 5? I've always been iffy on used phones, but have also been looking at the 1g Moto X. Ideally I do want something future proof, but also affordable and in good condition. I'm no hardcore gamer or anything so as long as the N4 will do the basics smoothly I should be well off :)."
nexus4,32ito9,greatscott19,2,Tue Apr 14 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"Well $160 is pretty good a price for a brand new unit. I did find 32 gig N5s going for $250 and the 16 gig models are for less than $200 (edit - used of course). It might be worth considering because it's going to have a longer update cycle, it's faster, and has a 1080p screen too. Not to mention a better camera too.

If you install a factory image, it overwrites the entire system image wiping it clean. You'd have to redo whatever customizations you want.  If you're just doing a factory wipe from the phone, that just formats cache, Davlik, and data. It doesn't touch the system partition at all. So whatever, you've done to the system partition will stick."

I've had an N1, Nexus S, HTC Thunderbolt, Galaxy Nexus, N4, and currently a N5. I'm sick of feeling like a beta tester and feeling like every phone is a compromise and nothing holds its value. Sorry for the rant. I'm just a huge android guy that feels like I've been let down."
nexus4,3249j4,derfasaurus,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"Indeed about the possible iOS switch. I did considerably research years ago when I was ready to pick my first smart phone: iOS or Android. While I recognized that Android is an open environment for ROMs and such, I had no desire to learn how to do any of that. I chose Android over iOS primarily because of how high the silos are around iOS. A few very basic issues for me with iOS that pushed me to Android include that with iOS I can't use the same mp3 audio file I've used for about a decade on a few dumb phones as my ringer. A dumb phone can do it, but an iPhone can't. Also, I hate a cluttered screen all top/left aligned - yes, I like widgets, but moreso, I want to put things where I want them and make them look how I want. My home screen is pretty basic and I rarely change it, but it's mine and it's how I want it to be.  All that said, if my OS is unstable, there's no point in having a phone that can have the home screen how I want it and an mp3 ring tone. I just want stability. Don't push me an OTA until it's tested. I know I'm on a Nexus device, but that doesn't mean I don't need my device to be functional because Google can't adequately test pre-OTA. I have ""flashed"" or whatever the words are once - to get my N4 the hell off of Lollipop and back to stock Kitkat 4.4.4."
nexus4,3249j4,RambleMan,5,Fri Apr 10 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"I was a huge iPhone fan, had one for three years but when the Nexus One arrived I saw the light. All the jailbreaking and workarounds I could just do with a stock device! The ringtone thing, audio books the same, notification songs you couldn't even customize (not sure you can even now). All that drove me nuts. Now here I am five years later considering going back. There's apps for ringtone making, audio books apps, podcast apps, I don't have to use Apple's software if I don't want to. I can use a custom keyboard.   I don't need titanium backup because icloud  backs up app settings, I can share files across apps now too. Plus when I put the phone in my pocket and come back to it two hours later the battery hasn't moved, I know some android people can do this but never me. Still lacking customization for sure but I'm a different person from five years ago.  I guess I'm old now because the appeal to me is that I don't have to micromanage the device, which I used to love to do. I don't know, still trialling with the old 4s, not ready to make the plunge yet but I'm really thinking about it."
nexus4,3249j4,derfasaurus,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:14:35 2015 UTC,"I think Google made a mistake when it pushed Nexus devices as cheap gear for the masses. They are still development devices, not consumer devices at heart. If you want a happy consumer experience then look at the S6 or similar, updates may take much longer but because it's a consumer product they have to do more testing.  As for the iOS switch, I was given an iPhone 6. It's a very nice device but honestly iOS is just something of a pain to use if your an Android fan."
nexus4,3249j4,Ivashkin,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"The thing with the nexus is I use the developer side of things, I unlock, I root, I flash custom roms and maybe it is my bad for trying to use it as a daily device when it really is a developer device. The thing is in my opinion there is no other Android option. After my HTC Thunderbolt experience with Sense and after playing with some Samsung devices, all that extra junk just really cutters and slows down the underlying OS.   Plus the fact that if the company decides to never push an update you may be forever stuck with whatever bugs you had when the device was first released. Suddenly that $600 device you can't even sell for $100.   Maybe if I went to a premium phone it would hold its value and be great at everything but I'm having trouble deciding to commit lots of hard earned cash to a maybe. I dug out my wife's old iPhone 4s that we've been using as a backup phone and I can say that Apple had addressed so many of the things I hated about iOS years ago, if I'm honest though, to fully make it what I want it needs a jailbreak."

nexus4,32435l,wizard_of_gram,3,Fri Apr 10 15:58:28 2015 UTC,Yes the battery just does not compete anymore. Especially if you're buying a used one.

Get a 1 plus one... 30 hours of battery before you need to charge...  and then it only takes about an hour and a half to get it upto 90%... I am a 1+ fanboy, it's the coolest!  IMO it's like the new nexus 4.  I get the same feeling as when I first got the N4.  The build quality, the features... the price! it's all there."

nexus4,32435l,dihydrogen_monoxide,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:54:56 2015 UTC,The limited battery life is the biggest reason I want to upgrade soon.

Take a look at http://www.gsmarena.com/battery-test.php3 to try and judge if the battery will be sufficient for your daily use.

nexus4,32435l,quazy,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"Battery is a massive problem on the Nexus 4. Mine lasted usually, just under a day or so with moderate use.   If you're looking for a cheap, powerful device, I can only recommend the OnePlus One which is what I upgraded to. It's a really powerful device at a ludicrously cheap price. The Nexus 4 is incredibly outdated in terms of hardware and it's nearing the end of official software support. The device doesn't (officially) have 4G/LTE and the hardware is now what you'd expect in a low-mid range device.  If you're really really wanting a Nexus 4 then obviously it's your choice - go ahead - I can only persuade you to look into the OnePlus One"
nexus4,32435l,louisjms,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. Most definitely. Honestly I would not buy one at this point. The Moto G would be a nicer choice. The processor in the Nexus 4 is more powerful, but gets hot, draws more power, and is at the end of its life cycle in terms of updates. And for the price of a used Nexus 4 you can get a Moto G. The Moto G benefits from just being newer at this point and is a great choice if you're looking for a cheap phone. The Moto G also has a way better camera."
nexus4,32435l,weinerschnitzelboy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:12:38 2015 UTC,"Battery life is definitely a concern, and would be the #1 reason for me not to buy a new Nexus 4 now, let alone a used one where this is even a bigger issue. #2 reason would be the camera, which is just blegh  How much the battery life will impact you depends on your usage, it can be pretty decent if you stay on wifi but just being on 3G all day long will drain half your battery without you ever touching it. Playing games drains it faster than anything, of course, but it also heats up the phone a lot.  Speaking of heat, putting it on your windshield and plugging it in will overheat your phone making it shut down, especially if you use Google Maps (some other nav apps work better in that regard). You don't want to find that out while you're driving to a job interview.."
nexus4,32435l,fiah84,0,Sat Apr 11 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"Not at all. After 2 years sing it all day long, now my battery is lasting 1 day. At the beginning I could use it for 2 or 3 days without needing to recharge."
nexus4,322lx4,pjmazza,28,Fri Apr 10 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"That's because the Nexus 4 originally shipped with the AOSP launcher, which is no longer maintained/updated by Google.

Worse, the sellers do not explicitly state this so unless you know what you're in for the risk could be too high to run through this hassle. But on the other hand, if you do get your hands on a OEM-quality part then replacing the screen yourself(preferably with a new assembly for a new chrome bezel) then the process of replacement is straight forward for the newbish DIY'er. Recommend looking at this previous reddit post about screen replacement quality.  If you are not feeling up to replacing your own stuff, you can always buy another Nexus 4 off of Swappa since they go for very cheap (most expensive was $150 for 16GB) and sellers always compete around the $110 range."

nexus4,31qwhd,Inprobamur,6,Tue Apr 7 17:43:19 2015 UTC,The last 5.0.2 release of Terminus ROM has been running great for me for exactly one month straight now.  I'm waiting on Xposed beta and kernel/binaries for 5.1 before switching.
nexus4,31qwhd,athibanvasanth,6,Tue Apr 7 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"I've been using PA for the last year or so. It's AOSP-based (rather than CM-based) so you can avoid a lot of the wierdness of CM. The ""I can't hear anyone and no one can hear me in calls"" problem that some people have been getting with both CM and Stock doesn't happen either."
nexus4,31qwhd,BeastMode797,2,Tue Apr 7 14:47:52 2015 UTC,I was using PA for a few months on KK but then went stock LP; couldn't wait!

nexus4,31qwhd,athibanvasanth,4,Tue Apr 7 15:38:07 2015 UTC,LP PA exists now so maybe he's using that. I'm waiting for their next release before I try it myself
nexus4,31qwhd,lord_dumbello,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"Same here, but I believe we are over a month away from release considering the devs will probably wait for 5.1 AOSP source code to be released and build on top of that."
nexus4,31qwhd,EmeraldIsler,2,Thu Apr 9 04:43:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't felt like I'm missing out on much from LP. On PA (also with Xposed) I get a lot of customization options that I know work well. Stuff like:   Stable (if older) kernel options Custom gamma and screen color settings Double-tap-to-wake and slide-to-sleep SecureSettings (tasker plugin) works properly and I can automatically disable lockscreen while on home wifi Greenify and all it's features work well CM-Themes work (custom colors, icons, etc throughout, transparent navigation & status bars) LTE enabled modems battery percentage icon separation of ringer & notification volumes so I can mute notifications at night automatically.   I know some of these things are available on lollipop but last I checked many weren't (and some had issues). PA KK is just so rock solid I haven't felt a need to upgrade. I get solid battery life with very few problems and  rarely have to reboot my phone (like once every 1-2 months). I'm not opposed to upgrade to LP but it doesn't seem to offer a lot of great new features that I would really appreciate and use."
nexus4,31qwhd,gilliam86,0,Tue Apr 7 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"Happy that you are enjoying PA KK :)   But I should say that ever since Xposed released for lollipop last month, most of the customizations have been stable if not better. Unique modules are being added every single day to Xposed.   Also custom ROMs like Chroma, SimpleAOSP, etc are becoming leaner that stability and battery life looks better than ever."
nexus4,31qwhd,Eldmor,2,Tue Apr 7 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not opposed to upgrading to LP, just that I don't see a ton of advantages for the work involved. I already get 3-4 hrs SOT with Hellscore and have awesome stability so what will LP add for me?"

nexus4,31qbgw,cttttt,2,Tue Apr 7 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I used to be in that camp, but looking back, I think it was because each new Nexus completely eclipsed the previous one, in actually practical ways.  Chrome pretty much requiring a phone with 2GB of RAM moved me to the 4.   No such need now.    In fact the spec bumps lately (bigger screens, higher PPI, ridiculous CPU speeds, GPUs) are completely unappealing and off putting  If a manufacturer came put with a phone with the 4s specs and form factor (and without being made entirely of glass) I'd buy I in an instant, but its all about getting 4K video on a phone...in a world of tablets and laptops."

nexus4,31qbgw,yupReading,8,Mon Apr 13 22:50:33 2015 UTC,"Nexus 4 was my first smart phone. Bought it when the price dropped $100 to $249, I think September 2013?  I recently bought a 32Gb LG G2 from EBay for $190. After applying many tweaks to bring it more in line with the look of stock Android, I am loving it. Better battery life, better camera, 4G LTE, better feel in hand, bigger screen.   Honestly, I wouldn't have been tempted had it not been for persistent issues with Nexus 4: the Screen of Death and people not hearing me on calls (since upgrading to Lollipop); the ticking sound that I would often hear over headphones; the poor camera and battery life; and frequently bumping up against its 16 GB storage limit.   Will still hold onto it and use it to play around with ROMs. I'll use it as a backup phone, too. But yeah, time to move on."
nexus4,31qbgw,Onlysaysgodknows,3,Tue Apr 7 10:44:30 2015 UTC,I also just Upgraded to the lg g2. Major improvement. 32 gigs. Built in remote control for TV. Super fast. 5.2 inch screen. And literally one of the best cameras on a smart phone you can get. All for around $200 brand new.

nexus4,31qbgw,Svardskampe,2,Tue Apr 7 10:53:25 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm currently not thinking about changing it up. It still serves what it does. Unless there is a tremendous value in changing into another one. (Cheap, swappable batteries on-the-fly and about the same performance with nexus-like openness of the bootloader so custom roms aplenty and a good ruggedness, with a phone size that is still usable and not a monster like the OPO - The Moto E/Gs come close), I see no need."
nexus4,31qbgw,itsdipping,2,Tue Apr 7 12:40:49 2015 UTC,"I got my Nexus 4 mid-'13 and was super happy with it. I've put a few custom ROMs on it, gone back to stock Android and vice versa. It's travelled the world with me and done a great job for a couple of years.   But there were just too many things that annoyed me about it. 16gb simply isn't enough storage for caching music while travelling. The camera constantly crashing (not just with Snapchat either) regardless of what ROM I ran. The camera being slow and of mediocre quality. The phone randomly turning itself off at random times, both day and night and with battery replacement (caused me to wake up late a handful of times and miss important phone calls). I just couldn't be bothered with it any more, so last week it got replaced.   It was a great phone while it was good, but sadly all electronics have a lifespan, and my 4's days are up."

I'm just not at the point where it's isn't doing the job good enough for me.

Those are the core hardware upgrades I'm looking for.  The camera is really nice, too. I'm fine with 12MP as long as the sensor has good low light performance. (3:2 12MP is the minimum resolution for capturing 16:9 4K video.)  I really like that they have both Qi and PMA charging. I never wanna go back to plugging in a cable.  Other than that, I don't need the other fluff like a fingerprint reader or IR sensor.  So bring out a Nexus with a fast, efficient 64-bit chip and 4GB LPDDR4 and I will probably give it an honest look. Everything else like the camera and screen specs should fall into line accordingly if they're going to give us that kind of baseline."

At the time it was released, the only real drawback was its battery and camera. The UI was relatively snappy, I personally didnt, and still dont, need more than 16GB on phone storage and the clean stock android UI was a godsend. We could root easily, I personally LOVE the glass back and and I paid USD 380 after taxes and shipping.   2 years later there still isnt much that can compete with it at the under $400 after taxes and shipping bracket. But my phone is getting old. My battery doesnt last as long as it used to. I have money now, I can afford a $600 phone unlocked, i want a better battery and beyter camers.

I wanted a great phone for around $350 with support for T Mobile bands 2, 4, and 12, and there are just not a lot of phones that meet that criteria right now...Maybe the Oneplus 2 will have those things.  I went with the Moto E because of the solid user reviews and the fact that it has all of the 4g Tmobile Channels...If the oneplus one supported all 3 I would have probably went with that, or maybe the Zenfone 2 (which supports 2 of those I think), but that is not available in the US now and I just couldn't use the N4 any longer."

nexus4,31p3e9,Zouden,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply.  The phone and the battery capacity seemed to be very reliable, just as it was from the day I bought it.   You know how if the phone is on vibrate mode, then you plug the charger in and it gives off a little vibration to let you know its charging?  Well when I did this with 10% of my capacity left, it literally would not stop vibrating until I either unplugged the charging cable, or allowed it to drain its capacity totally.  Now when I plug the charging cable in (and the battery is now totally drained), the red light that normally pops up/flashes goes from a tiny dim irregular light to a flashing red light back and forth just as rapidly as it was vibrating rapidly before after attempting to charge it when it still had capacity.  Its almost as if there is a loose/broken solder connection.  I don't have the tools or know how to comfortably break into it and fix it myself.  I really hope it is not the battery because I have read how expensive the tech shops charge to replace them.  If anyone else has some more input before I take it to the shop, I would be most grateful."
nexus4,31p3e9,Zouden,2,Tue Apr 7 12:31:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah I had the constant vibration thing too. I had to be careful when charging it - holding the cable in the right angle etc. I thought my microUSB slot was broken, but mysteriously it kinda fixed itself after a while, so maybe it just had some dirt in it.  Your phone is probably charging slowly because it's not getting the full current. It might even say that it's charging by USB instead of AC (look in the battery stats screen).  You could try cleaning the USB slot but there's a good chance there's a weak connection inside. Good luck!"
nexus4,31p3e9,clockbox,2,Tue Apr 7 12:39:28 2015 UTC,I would try a different USB cable.  It's possible that the connector on the cable has worn out.  Micro USB was designed so that the cable connector would fail before the socket since it's easier to replace a cable than a socket.

nexus4,31i4zq,chr0m389,5,Sun Apr 5 09:35:55 2015 UTC,"2-3 hours on average.  When I have the phone on, I use it hard."

nexus4,31i4zq,_FluX23,2,Sun Apr 5 13:34:55 2015 UTC,That's horrifying
nexus4,31i4zq,Intuition17,2,Sun Apr 5 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I was fine with the N4's battery too until I switched to G3. I normally had around 2 hours of sot on regular day so it didn't matter that much, but I was always anxious to go anywhere if I had less than 60% charge. ATM I have over 3,5 hours of screen time and still have 50+% of battery left. I can't imagine switching back to phone with a worse battery life."

nexus4,31i4zq,Psychozoa,13,Sun Apr 5 14:58:59 2015 UTC,I love my nexus 4 but I need much better battery life than just 2-3 hours screen on time.
nexus4,31i4zq,Kwrzyx,3,Sun Apr 5 10:23:37 2015 UTC,"A factory reset might help; upgrading to Lollipop murdered the battery life on all my Android devices, and a reset fixed it on everything. You might also try installing a new kernal, like Franco or Hellscore. It really improves SoT."
nexus4,31i4zq,delongedoug,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:34:45 2015 UTC,Mine ran great and I loved it but the battery life just forced me into a OPO.

nexus4,31i4zq,smoothblueglue,19,Sun Apr 5 15:31:52 2015 UTC,Just get an external battery charger. This sounds like a horrible phone experience.
nexus4,31i4zq,delongedoug,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:03:48 2015 UTC,Carry a phone and an external battery? Why not carry one device that works? I had to bring an external battery to survive a day in the city last week. That's no way to live.
nexus4,31i4zq,smoothblueglue,2,Sun Apr 5 22:37:35 2015 UTC,I only carry an external if I'm going on long trips. I'd love a new phone with great battery life but I'll have to wait for the next Nexus. Hopefully it's not a giant expensive one.

Idk I just don't see the point in having a nice phone with a good screen, capable of background services and notification along with the good features that use location if I'm going to cut everything out, you could just buy a nokia :P"

Runs fast, almost no problems and battery life is 4 to 5 hours SOT which is enough to get me through the day. I'm anxiously waiting for 5.1 to see if I can squeeze another year out of this phone. If it would break I would be clueless about which phone could take it's place. To me it's perfect in almost every way."
nexus4,31i4zq,skooterz,3,Sun Apr 5 12:54:29 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with mine either. After the last update it feels like a new phone. Goes the entire day with moderate to little use.

nexus4,31i4zq,EmilioASStevez,2,Sun Apr 5 12:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, me too! My Nexus 4 is doing just fine.  I can't believe how much issues people seem to have! I've never experienced things like ""Sleep of death"", camera reboots (except for Snapchat, which I don't use), and such.   The only complaint I have is that the battery is starting to show its age. But hey, I don't think only the battery is a reason to upgrade, because it still provides a few hours of usage, and lasts for ages in standby. And to be realistic, I'm almost always near an electric outlet or a computer anyways. I also own a really cheapo powerbank, which also helps."

nexus4,31i4zq,MrLazyRichard,1 point,Sun Apr 5 22:09:21 2015 UTC,How many factory resets have you done? I would have said the same things about this phone as you did on KitKat but with lollipoo things have been quite the opposite
nexus4,31i4zq,box2925,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:36:47 2015 UTC,I haven't done a single factory reset since jellybean. Lolipop worked for me flawlessly.

nexus4,31i4zq,EmilioASStevez,1 point,Sun Apr 5 13:58:53 2015 UTC,I could but honestly the quality is always hit or miss for me. I have my GV number routed to my real number and quality is so much better over that.

nexus4,31jtjr,ISaidGoodDey,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"to help your endeavor, I'll say replacing the screen is very easy if you purchase the entire assembly.  I replaced my own in about 30 mins with no difficulty.  side note: I'm an ""IT guy"" so it may have just seemed simple to me but there are plenty of videos on YouTube that make sense of it.  all that's necessary is a torx (T6 I believe) screwdriver & some two sided adhesive (possible to purchase an actual pre-cut form specifically for the N4 on either eBay or Amazon).  it's still a great phone so anyone that buys will be able to repair for around $80.  I got an OEM LCD assembly for around $70 from etradesupply.com because doing just the glass itself seemed like it would be a nightmare if u don't know what you're doing & don't have an LCD separator machine (those themselves are around $300)"
nexus4,31jtjr,NYCsOwn,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:05:22 2015 UTC,Thank you! I had considered this however I couldn't justify spending that much for the repair when I had already been considering getting a new phone. Ended up with a z3c so the nexus has been a paperweight the past few weeks.

nexus4,31imxv,TrentonJ,4,Sun Apr 5 13:23:44 2015 UTC,Good to hear you are able to upgrade. The X is a great choice especially because it's like a Nexus. I am thinking of getting a Windows Phone to supplement my Nexus 4 usage but I don't know how that will turn out.
nexus4,31imxv,_FluX23,2,Sun Apr 5 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"did the same as you to try something new (lumia 520)...if you're not too invested in google stuff (gmail, music, drive, etc) then it won't be that bad.

nexus4,31imxv,_FluX23,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Just curious why would you want another device to use with n4? Does that mean you will carry two devices all the time?
nexus4,31imxv,tamrinkhan,2,Sun Apr 5 23:47:57 2015 UTC,Well for one I would like to test out the WP ecosystem and see how Windows 10 will work. Also I would probably use that phone for long distance trips because the Lumia 640 on T-Mobile supports Band 2 LTE (and possibly Band 12) so I can get better data in rural areas. The Nexus 4 only has Band 4 so I can only get data in urban areas and 3G isn't as widespread on T-Mo.  Also battery life is probably better so those are the main reasons I would like a better phone (and low cost).
nexus4,31imxv,_FluX23,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"ok dude, your money. at least do yourself a favor and get one with those good cameras, so it wouldn't be a complete flop."

nexus4,31jy3a,xbp13x,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing if it gets that drained, there was just not enough power to keep the clock going from a completely dead state. Similar thing happens if a CMOS battery in a computer dies or is removed."
nexus4,31h7z5,HURCANADA,2,Sun Apr 5 01:29:42 2015 UTC,Double check that your microUSB port isn't full of lint. That's what happened to me.
nexus4,31h7z5,Kichigai,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but what I did was try and clean the area out with a fine sewing needle. My method generally gets pretty sure results, but if you aren't careful you might risk a short along the USB power pins."
nexus4,31h7z5,Kichigai,2,Sun Apr 5 05:15:09 2015 UTC,You could also use a toothpick as an alternative to this since it's non-conductive.
nexus4,31h7z5,BigGigabit,1 point,Sun Apr 5 05:25:16 2015 UTC,My concern is that toothpick would be too wide to fit into a microUSB port.

nexus4,31f7t5,lahirutarz,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:00:06 2015 UTC,You don't have to. Just replace/twist the rubber gasket on proximity sensor. Inspect how it's glued with sound socket & you can remove it without touching the motherboard.

When I popped the back open, I saw that the battery cable had a small crack in it, and thus it was as if the battery wasn't connected at all. I had to replace the whole battery unit to fix.  I guess you should check all your wires? If you disconnect the battery completely, do you get exactly the same light patterns/restarting at recovery? If so, that's a strong indication that something is wrong with the battery or the battery connection."

It turned out that my battery was completely shot and had started to warp.  If you're having battery problems, it wouldn't hurt to either replace the battery yourself (which is cheap and not too hard) or get it replaced at a phone repair store.  All my battery and signal issues were fixed after the battery was replaced. Not saying that it might be directly related to your issue but if you go this route, worse case scenario is that you have better battery life but it doesn't fix the SIM issues."

nexus4,31cq6x,darknyan,2,Fri Apr 3 22:24:45 2015 UTC,Is Hells Doc better than Franco? I heard they both improve battery life.
nexus4,31cq6x,Sam5813,3,Sat Apr 4 09:16:12 2015 UTC,"You hear so many different opinions about stuff like this and there are so many variables that influence battery life that it's pretty much impossible to say unless you try both under equal conditions (which should be as close to your average usage scenario). Chances are that the difference is negligible.  I personally use Franco just because it was the first one I tried back in the day and I just stuck with it cause it always worked well and the app is pretty good, too (and I bought the non-free one). But from what I've heard hells doc is awesome as well, but just looking at the xda post, setting it up seems to be a bit more complicated if you wanna do more than just flash and forget."

Had to uninstall updated binaries, they boot looped my phone. Nothing abnormal.

The Moto X is pretty close to stock so other than a bigger screen and faster, the experience looks the same. Having said that, there's a level of subtle polish that makes this my favourite android phone ever. The moto enhancements are genuinely good, especially being able to wave at your phone to wake it up.  Battery life is better, but again not revelatory.

Nowadays, of course, I know to limit data usage (something I never had to do with my plan) but I'd still rather not have her ROM use all her data allowance on faulty ota downloads."
nexus4,31aijg,DonEliano,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:45:13 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the OTA is because of Google play services, and the only way to stop it is freezing the play services app. Which isn't a very good idea since it'll mess with other Gapps. Don't think PA has that OTA kill feature."

For SOD, no real fix just lots of things to try, clear Play Services cache, switch browser, avoid Netflix. Happens much less on stock 4.4.4 and below, if at all for most people.

nexus4,318m10,Smoeki,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"I had similar problems I was using CM 11 as well, Stock lolipop and stock kitkat as well.  My big one was SOD (sleep of death) 2 times a day on bad days :(...  Some of the problems you listed like the phone calls, there are known fixes for.  The crashes and SODs are another problem I see that many people seem to have completely different fixes for.  They did nothing for me, however I did find my own fix and seemingly the cause.  Long story short PVstar+ was wreaking havok on my phone and even after I uninstalled it I kept getting SODs.  I stumbled on my own fix by accident because google removed it from the play store and I didn't automatically install it this time after I would restored my device.  So basically an app with no root access f'd my phone up without me knowing it for half the year.  The only thing I can suggest is doing a complete wipe and reformat of your device with TWRP. Install stock lolipop 5.0.1, everything stock, Recovery, radio, etcc...   Reflash TWRP and root, make a backup in TWRP,  Install apps (and updates) 3 or 4 at a time and wait a day or two and look for problems.  Personally I waited 2 weeks to install other non essential apps and then started installing in small batches.   I made it to 3 weeks of up time, no crashes or SODs before I had to reboot from the memory leak bug in stock 5.0.1.  At that time I made another TWRP backup and 5 days later I made it to the problem app PVstar.  Crashes and SOD that very day.  I uninstalled it but the SODs continued,  I had to wipe (no reformat this time) and then I restored my backup with TWRP.   I downloaded everything I knew was working and I have yet to have another crash or SOD in 3 more weeks.  I'm up to date on all the normal google apps (hangouts, chrome etc..) and all my apps are reinstalled except for PVstar...  Smooth sailing so far :)  I'm pretty confident that the SOD and crashes are not just hardware related for most people, rather it's possibly some app screwing your phone up.   I'm going to see if I can keep my phone going as is for another 3 weeks, (3 weeks seem to be the limit before I have to reboot the phone because of the 5.0.1 memory leak bug) and if I don't get a SOD I'm going to look at installing Xposed or CM12 for more customization options.  Although I may encrypt my phone again and wait a few weeks to make sure that isn't a problem as well.  Best luck in finding your fix."

The only thing I do is to lower my idle frequency to 192 MHz and try different kernels. You addressed both these great points in your article. :)  A little bit about undervolting - I've done this on circuits and it has the potential to make your chip a little more unreliable. You are essentially decreasing the gate voltage of transistors here. I don't know what the power gains are from it, but it does not seem like it is worth the effort. It is also pretty hard to get right.  Undervolting and overvolting are not something you should do unless you know what you're doing. It is also not something you should trust somebody else did right for you (unless its the manafacturer)."

Download the Ubuntu 32bit ISO from their website.its labelled something like ""ubuntu-desktop-i386.ISO""  Download universal USB installer, and point it to the Ubuntu ISO. This will do the work for you.  Reboot your computer and mash f12 on the BIOS screen. Select ""USB: UUI"" and it'll boot Ubuntu. Pick ""boot live ISO"" and you'll be on the Ubuntu desktop in a few seconds.  From here you can plug in the nexus 4 and itll either detect the device or not detect the device.  If it does, its windows, if it doesn't its your phone, the cable or the computer port   If it doesn't, click the Ubuntu (start button) in the top left and type ""terminal"" open it.  Type ""sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb"" without the quotes.  This will give you adb.  When this is done, plug in your nexus again with USB debugging enabled and type ""adb devices"" you should see your device there.

I don't have encryption on. For the past year or so, I assume since fixing my screen, whenever I boot my phone there is a 50% chance it will go into this state of not letting me touch it. Yesterday I just figured out, just like you, that I can touch it, but it takes multiple fingers (how in the world did you figure this out?). So, I'm usually forced to hold the power button down for 10 seconds and hope for the best.  I also have the opposite problem, which I assumed was related. 90% of the time, when my battery gets below anywhere from 25-5% (it seems to be some random value), it starts producing ""ghost touches"" where it basically acts like I'm touching my screen over and over again. It makes the phone impossible to use. Have you experienced anything like that?

I didn't realize it, and I kept thinking it was the LTE enabler zip file that didn't work (it worked fine) rather than my settings.  Eventually, I tracked it down and everything is working great for me  (I'm on StraightTalk using AT&Ts network and I have a LTE tower on band 4 nearby)."

nexus4,30to9v,ItsNotRocketSurgery,3,Mon Mar 30 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"I looked pretty extensively, and I never had anyone tell me with any certainty that they found a replacement screen that was genuine gorilla glass. Certainly the screens from fixez are not gorilla glass. I know that because I personally broke 3 of them. One of them by leaning lightly on the back of the phone with the replaced glass facing my leg. Nothing ever even touched the replacement screen glass. More to the point, are you making a claim that the e-trade supply screens are gorilla glass? I've also been told that ""OEM"" does not necessarily mean gorilla glass, and that it just means the screen came from an ""original equipment manufacturer"". Meaning, the screen may have come from a manufacturer that does make the original gorilla glass screens, but this isn't necessarily one of them. I don't have any personal experience with e-trade supply though."
nexus4,30to9v,red_sky,3,Mon Mar 30 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"The screen that I bought from E-Trade Supply has LG markings on the inside of the housing, leading me to believe that it comes from them through a third party."

nexus4,30to9v,ProfessorPurple,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"I can't say for certain that the e-trade supply screens are gorilla glass, but they are decently sturdy.   My original screen broke from a ~4.5' fall onto hardwood flooring while inside the official bumper case. I bought a replacement front housing from e-trade supply; and as far as I could tell when installing it, was identical to the original. I don't know anyone else with a Nexus 4 so I don't know how the screen quality compares to the original screen. At the very least it is acceptable, nothing is obviously wrong with the screen quality. I have noticed that the digitizer grid, visible when the screen is off, is distinctly less visible than the original screen. I have one of the first batches, before the rubber nubs on the back, so maybe a less visible digitizer grid is normal for newer phones.  The replacement screen survived multiple falls onto concrete from ~3'-4' without a case. It finally broke from a very short fall, less than a foot, onto concrete. It landed on a single small rock which is really what cracked the screen. I bought another screen from e-trade supply (and a TPU case), so far no problems with it.   I noticed that e-trade supply sells two versions of the front housing, an OEM version and non-OEM version. I've only bought the OEM version so I don't know if the quality of the non-OEM version is similar."

I bought an aftermarket one and not only was the screen much weaker (it's already cracked by now), but it seemed to be less oleophobic than the original. One last hint, get a proper tool kit, as the ones that come with such screens usually are not exact fits and thus may wear down screws etc."
nexus4,30uxhq,passivevigilante,3,Mon Mar 30 22:29:10 2015 UTC,It is possible to replace just the LCD (which is the part you need to replace) but you run a high risk of breaking the glass/digitizer anyway.  I'd stick with the full display assembly on this. It SO much easier.

nexus4,30uxhq,parpat51492,2,Tue Mar 31 02:55:38 2015 UTC,"I've done a couple screen replacements and I find it best to buy the display assembly with the frame already attached (better dust seal, significantly easier installation). If you want to use your original frame through, you'll also need to buy the 3M double sided adhesive to reattach the screen.  As far as video on how to separate the LCD and Digitizer/glass it would be something like this  or this"

nexus4,30re5p,kenrenji,4,Mon Mar 30 01:39:40 2015 UTC,"This is unfortunately a very common issue with Nexus 4 phones. A lot of Nexus 4 CPUs have a hardware glitch where instead of entering sleep mode, they turn off completely, crashing the phone.  This is commonly referred to as the 'sleep of death', and the nexus 4 isn't the only phone that's had this issue. Some Nexus 4s encounter the glitch more often than others, and some don't encounter the glitch until you've had the phone for a while.   Some people have had success using custom ROMs and/or custom kernels, but it depends on how much effort you want to put into making your phone work, and how much technical knowledge you have.  Personally, I use Faux kernel and CyanogenMod 11. There are plenty of other solutions floating around, but all the ones that work work because they let keep your phone from entering/waking up from sleep mode as often. (Every time you wake up from sleep mode means you'll have to enter it again or your battery will drain really quickly)    Long story short, you'll probably never be able to completely fix this without buying a new phone."

nexus4,30lmkr,_FluX23,2,Sat Mar 28 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"The update from 4.2 to 4.3 slowed down this phone significantly. Pressing the power button no longer immediately shuts the screen off, and no longer immediately turns the screen back on. There was a slight lag introduced to everything after that. Then 4.4 introduced a slower notification bar, as well as an odd way of treating it as a single-touch overriding everything else on screen. When web-browsing you used to be able to scroll the page up, then slide the notification bar down (to see whatever stats you wanted) while continuing scrolling the page. This was a useful mutli-touch feature that was eliminated with 4.4. 5 is looking to be even further from what this phone should be, with many users complaining about wakelocks, extreme battery usage, sleeps of death and other various bugs. Google stopped focusing on the Nexus 4 after 4.2 and I'm not upgrading any further.  After a factory reset I'll likely flash a custom 4.2 rom to bring this phone back to its most stable update."

I have not updated to a later build which might have the changes merged but I really hope that the issue is fixed.

nexus4,30bst7,tendyfish,3,Thu Mar 26 14:46:12 2015 UTC,I ended up leaving for an N5 about a month and a half ago and I believe it was a good choice.  Letting the N4 go into the drawer of obsolete technology was the hardest shit ever. Its the first phone I had for over 2 years that I didn't feel needed to be replaced or have a deep burning hate for by the end of its run.  I wish the N6 wasn't so big and made by Motorola but rumor has it that LG and Google are back together for next year's nexus so my fingers are crossed that we'll see something as sexy as the N4 and N5 by the end of the year.

You'll have to decide if you want to flash anything custom in the future or stay on pure stock, if you cannot access your device via PC.   If you want OTA updates, find out if the stock recovery is installed, or flash it via custom recovery, as the last act."

nexus4,30847i,lalenavari,2,Thu Mar 26 02:23:33 2015 UTC,The camera does suck.  I bought my mother a MotoG for Xmas and even such a low end phone has a substantially better camera.  If i really needed higher quality photos i'd buy a $50 camera.  They beat the crap out of even the best phones
nexus4,30847i,ydna_eissua,3,Thu Mar 26 02:34:09 2015 UTC,Tried using an N5 - battery life was so much worse than N4  Tried LG G2 - didn't like non-stock Android OS and the button placements  Went back to the N4 after both experiences :) best phone ever

nexus4,30847i,ydna_eissua,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:23:36 2015 UTC,I did research rooting and custom roms but it all looked too tedious and I didn't like the increased probability of bricking the phone and threat to security etc. when I was just fine with my Nexus 4.
nexus4,30847i,very_crazy_idiot,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:55:42 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  It can seem a little daunting if you've never done it before.  I highly suggest when you are looking to replace your Nexus 4 have a go putting a rom on it.  The process is extremely streamlined thanks to the tool kits available.
nexus4,30847i,ydna_eissua,2,Fri Mar 27 05:03:21 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. Absolutely love the phone (going on 3 years)!
nexus4,30847i,jeepersnz,14,Thu Mar 26 05:58:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed the Nexus 4 is the most beautiful looking phone. Those curves and the glass back are gorgeous. I changed the battery couple of months back and battery life has somewhat improved, but not so so much. A better battery and a better camera is all I could ask for in this device. Finding an upgrade would be tough because the N4 was so low priced with such amazing features."

nexus4,30847i,atfsix,12,Mon Mar 30 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"This is my first Android phone; I used iPhone before because, frankly, Android took some time to mature and I needed a smartphone in the meantime. I'm soooo happy with Android now, I'll never go back. The N4 is a masterpiece (except for the completely unnecessary glass back, I mean wtf people?) and I love it. Looking at today's market, a replacement would mean either getting a much lesser phone, or an equal that is horribly expensive. So I hope it will last at least another year, preferably two or three, although that's probably pushing it."
nexus4,30847i,FinibusBonorum,8,Wed Mar 25 06:11:43 2015 UTC,except for the completely unnecessary glass back   The glass shiny back is what makes it so aesthetically pleasing.  Absolutely love it
nexus4,30847i,ydna_eissua,2,Wed Mar 25 10:47:24 2015 UTC,But mine has shattered twice and I'm not replacing it this second time. Ugh... A plastic back is just so much easier.   I'm considering to tear off the shattered glass of the original back that I still have and replace it with leather. It would be so much more pleasing! And a lot more durable.

Face first onto a pavement though?  Game over man.    Will keep it and fix it up for another year at least all being well.  The HTCs are shockingly expensive, even the 'old' M7/8 and then you're facing second hand devices with aging batteries - granted nowhere near as bad as the Nexus 4 even in its prime but still.  Thus the Nexus 2015 hope - if it's even a 5inch like the Nexus 5 I'd be likely buying one"

Maybe with another kernel preventing the sleep of death."
nexus4,30847i,hellsop,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:26:52 2015 UTC,I did exactly that with 5.0. I flashed the original ROM to do a full reset.  The usb port problem is me plugging a dirty cable in it (snow and salt)...
nexus4,30847i,oldmonkmgm,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:29:01 2015 UTC,"It's at least hardware-influenced.  The vast majority of the ""Sleep of Death"" reports surround the N4 running stock OS. There's some for N5, and a few for other phones using non-stock OS. But it's not 100% hardware because the problems reported increased with Lollipop's release. Maybe 5.1 will help. Maybe Google's closing the defect reports as ""obsolete"" because they'd rather you just buy a different phone.  (There's dozens and dozens of ""solutions"" in the comments on those defects, btw, all of which the posters claimed solved it for them. But they can't all be true because they all depend on turning off various things that others have zero problems are using like wifi, ""OK Google"" voice keywords, Android Device Manager, obscure tunneling software, rolling back to 4.4.2, etc. etc. etc.)"

Then, get to a computer, login to Cerberus and wipe the device remotely. I've already created a rule in Cerberus that if there are 10 incorrect pass code attempts, the device auto-wipes.

Well, I decided to clean out the charging port because at times it wouldnt hold on to the plug very well. Two years of pocket carry had gunked it up. Turns out, that was a couple weeks ago and, knock on wood, the once daily problem has not returned. All I can figure is that it was shutting itself down to avoid some type of cross signal over the pin connectors. It is once again, running just as expected. Hope this helps others out there."

Sadly the 'e' on the nexus of the skin has peeled off but it's hopefully kept the back crack free. I haven't had the courage to peel it off to check.  I can't believe this phone isn't rated higher. I think it's the perfect balance of ergonomics and specs. The display is unique (thanks to the extra 48 pixels in width) and I love it when the devs I work with (people who should know about this phone) remark about the resolution. I only wish the camera were better but I really don't take too many pictures anymore, so it's not that big a deal.   Have to say that despite what others are experiencing with their N4s, Lollipop has given this a new lease of life. And I am so happy that I didn't buy a new phone for the heck of it last year.   I intend to keep it for as long as I can. It's been such a trusty companion and no other phone has pleased me as much. Love it to bits and till it's in bits."

Pie Control and move them to the side with a swipe. This phone is a monster device that I have used the hell out of every day for 30 months and its still solid.

The module does exactly what its name says, meaning your screen will stay on when you connect a call.

nexus4,3056rb,CatsAreGods,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:00:57 2015 UTC,Greenify is good as well if rooted on xposed you can include system apps too. I have it set to hibernate at screen turn-off.  DS Battery saver will also allow a variety of settings from off then 'gentle' to  the most aggressive being 'slumberer' where when the screen is off everything is in deep sleep mode. I can get more than 3 days out of my N4 but you don't have to go that full-on...you can set custom to choose what apps will deep sleep and if wifi/data is on at all times.

Finally tried a couple Roms last summer, the added features are nice but there are always more problems with custom Roms.

nexus4,304wjl,jashsu,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"Note that even if usb debugging is enabled, adb might not help you. The reason is because when adbd detects a connection from a host it has not interacted with before, it will throw a prompt onto the screen asking the user to allow USB debugging for that host. If you can't touch the touchscreen, you won't be able to get past that hurdle.  If the device was not encrypted, you might be able to install a custom recovery (like CWM or TWRP) and use adb to pull files from there. Recoveries tend to be workable with just the vol up/vol down/power buttons. Google for more info about how to use those tools.  Good luck."

After much frantic Googling and trying various solutions, here's what worked for me:   Turn on airplane mode and click through the alerts until they stop. Go into Settings > Apps and find Google Play services. Tap Uninstall Updates and follow the prompts to restore the app to factory default. I had to remove Google Device Manager from device administrators to complete this. Disable airplane mode and enjoy all the apps warning you that you need to update Google Play Services. Update Google Play Services.   If this does not work for you, after turning on airplane mode, go into Settings > Accounts and remove your Google account. Then, after doing everything and reconnecting to the internet, re-add your account and log in.  I hope one of these methods fixes the problem for you.

But still...  If I do decide to upgrade again when the 2 comes out I figure I'll be able to sell the one for probably $200 when the 2 releases so it's a net loss of only $150... And it's totally worth $150 to have a functional phone with a good battery for the next few months."

Come on!) present in flag ships. Though usually the cheaper ones are total carbage and even midrange phones tend to see their support drop almost immediately.  I made around 400-500e my beeline, but after I got N4 for 250e shipped by a third party from Germany 2 years back, I really have hard time justifying these prices. I'd really like to get that 1+1 but right now I can't afford to wait for that long.  My Nexus slid so many times off the table by itself I had to get a vinyl skin to cover the glass back."

N4 has the best price vs spec ratio even now and you can't expect the same unless going with a Chinese developer. The 1+1 has it, but it's on a different price range. Also it has some overblown specs. So if I were you, I would go for the N5. You can find better deals on swappa. With N5 nothing can go wrong except for the battery, which can be fixed using a backup battery pack."

nexus4,2zgsii,altercreed,3,Thu Mar 19 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"My nexus 4 was having problems, I didn't want something with a huge screen, so I just upgraded to a used LG G2 for $180.  It's filled with bloatware but once flashed to cyanogenmod 12 it's the stock android lollipop experience that we all know and love.  Hardware wise it's solid improvement over the N4 in every aspect, 50% bigger battery, 1gb extra RAM, 2x larger hard drive, a few extra megapixels on the camera, and it cost me less then my nexus did.  The screen is .5"" bigger but the width of the phone is basically the same, it's just a bit taller but the G2 has much smaller bezels so even with the bigger screen the overall size of the phone is not much bigger."

At this size there isn't much, buying xperia its basically buying a phone that might not have any support soon since sony its leaving mobile altogether (that timing, just when they start releasing phones that aren't shit) and even medium sized phones are 5""+.  It sucks the N6 has a Note price but without the perks like the stylus. The N5 its already old and has a lot of the same drawbacks of the N4, besides the price its pretty much the same than when it launched nearly 2 years ago. I almost bought a OPO but the quality issues and problems with cyanogen gave me that bad vibe all 'premium' chinese phone have."

The Z3C's specs compared to the Nexus 4 are equal or better (mostly better) on all counts, even the Z1C is compared to the N4.  I've been debating between the Z1C and Z3C, but I haven't bit the bullet yet, I still enjoy my N4 setup.  I'm having trouble going away from wireless charging (though the Z1C/Z3C have a proprietary magentic getup I like).  I'm also unsure if I want a big phone or not, part of me likes the idea of a giant screen but I hate lugging them around in my pocket and losing one-handed control.  I'll probably end up going with one of these Xperia compacts if nothing better comes along in the next 6-12 months though."
nexus4,2zgsii,NeckbeardTheElder,2,Thu Mar 19 01:55:44 2015 UTC,"The Z3c is slightly better, but is it really worth the price difference over the N4? That's why I couldn't justify that particular upgrade even though the Z3c would be my #1 choice of the phones out right now. Not worth paying $530 new for though over what I have.  Z4c, if it comes out and is still actually small, will be the phone I probably get next."
nexus4,2zgsii,Omnibitent,3,Thu Mar 19 07:02:26 2015 UTC,"It's more than slightly better, it's a ~6mo old flagship phone...Sony is about the only company not knocking their specs down for their compact models.  The difference between the Z1C and Z3C is fairly minor, other than the slightly smaller screen.  I'm still pondering the Z1C for ~$300USD over the Z3C, but the longer I wait the cheaper they both get.  Just look at the benchmarks for the Z1C compared to the Nexus 4, it's not even in the same league comparable (generally ~2x better depending on the benchmark you use)."

The SoC has plenty of horsepower and RAM for performance, and Qualcomm has been pretty good about supporting it with drivers thus far. However, it takes a lot of effort to put together a release for legacy hardware, relative to the number of users who will actually benefit from it. And of course there are no immediate dollars to be gained.  I'd give it one in three odds that we see the next major release, and that high only because you still have brand new (midrange and low-end) phones being released with less powerful SoCs, and half the RAM and storage. That said, I really appreciate the support thus far, and I'm strongly considering getting a N6 over a Galaxy S6 because of it.

I will rank them in order 1,2,3.All are generally stable & unique. Also frank gives a closer to stock experience with added stability. However my current setup is Stock + Xposed. Mainly because I realized that whatever the ROM I flash, it keeps returning to stock in a catastrophic failure. Also the stock ROM is odexed - which leads to better stability IMO."

I'm not sure this is the memory leak, I don't have launcher redraws, filled ram, killed apps in the background. I've tried various kernels and settings and what not. I even had the phone locked on all 4 cores all the time at 1.5 GHz all the time and even then it lags. Restarting the phone only helps for a few hours. I fucking hate this phone."

nexus4,2zci8z,totalBS,5,Tue Mar 17 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"Google actually says they support devices for 18 months, that's why lollipop was so questionable"
nexus4,2zci8z,clgoh,3,Tue Mar 17 17:56:08 2015 UTC,But the Nexus 7 (2012) is older and still supported. I'm hoping that the Nexus 4 will get 1 version more.
nexus4,2zci8z,totalBS,2,Tue Mar 17 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the 18 months is what google has actually said it guarantees. The N7 and N4 are outside that range and they've been the first two nexus devices (actually three with the N10) to get support into their second year. All the other nexuses (nexi?) didn't make it to 2 years so there was no way way of actually knowing we'd get 5.0 because it hadn't been done before. The phone can probably handle another update but I'm not convinced it'll happen"
nexus4,2zci8z,tylercoder,-2,Tue Mar 17 19:14:48 2015 UTC,first two nexus devices  first two   Lol wut? You forgetting the previous 3 years of Nexus devices son...

None of them got an update after 24 months  Edit: The nexus one didn't receive 4.0 and that came out on month 21 of its life, the nexus s didn't get 4.2 which came out on month 23 of its life, and the galaxy nexus didn't get 4.4 which came out on month 23 of its life. Their last actual update was received (on average) around month 20. So the nexus 4, 7, and 10 were the first group to break that cycle"

nexus4,2zci8z,mikeymop,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:22:32 2015 UTC,I assume it's a maximum because support is expensive
nexus4,2zci8z,_FluX23,5,Tue Mar 17 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah :/ The thing is that in 2012, phone internals pretty much reached the peak of their evolution - newer processors might be faster or have 64-bit but the truth is that our S4 Pro is still just as capable.  If Google does not support the Nexus 4 for Android M, then it must be a huge change or Google has planned obsolescence."
nexus4,2zci8z,QuillRat,7,Tue Mar 17 13:43:11 2015 UTC,The thing that would really hinder it is Qualcomm ending support for the S4 Pro chipset.
nexus4,2zci8z,_FluX23,2,Tue Mar 17 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"True point, that would mean Moto X 2013 gets discontinued as well."
nexus4,2zci8z,TeutonJon78,2,Tue Mar 17 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"That's the real trick. QC definitely has no skin in the game to keep supporting old chipsets, other than the fact that they aren't really much different from a software perspective at this point other than number of cores and speed."
nexus4,2zci8z,ChromoZoneX,2,Tue Mar 17 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"the fact that they aren't really much different from a software perspective at this point other than number of cores and speed   This is not always true. The hardware is probably different today than what it was in 2012. Additionally, every chip that is supported requires some kind of engineering resources - resources that they could and probably should use elsewhere.  Honestly, at this point I'd be happy if they pushed out updates/fixes for the chipset only in the event of a security flaw."
nexus4,2zci8z,RambleMan,0,Wed Mar 18 04:04:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, the battery and camera flaws are there, but I can work with them. The biggest and really only significant problem I've had with my N4 is Lollipop. I wish Google had NOT pushed L to the N4. The whole process of figuring out how and then forcing my N4 back to 4.4.4 was irritating and demonstrated to me that I cannot trust Google to adequately test their products before unleashing them on the public. I don't want M."

nexus4,2zci8z,VirtualMontage,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:06:09 2015 UTC,There's still a chance. The only reason we wouldn't get Android M would be due to hardware limitations or Google merely not wanting to support it anymore.
nexus4,2zci8z,Garth_Lawnmower,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:26:33 2015 UTC,Why do you say that it almost didn't get Lollipop?
nexus4,2zci8z,bjacks12,2,Tue Mar 17 18:47:18 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I just feel that way.  I don't have anything real solid, but I think it was very much a late decision to go ahead with it.  I think that initial press release that omitted it....likely written at some point where they hadn't decided to green light the N4 and wasn't corrected by the time it was published.   Also given their whole 18 month 'policy'"
nexus4,2zci8z,physics4life,2,Tue Mar 17 19:44:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, the press release was correctly almost instantly, and dev builds if L had been showing up on the N4 for a while.  I don't think L was a last minute decision, but I do think that M is getting unlikely."

nexus4,2zci8z,tylercoder,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:10:05 2015 UTC,No.  Right now the hardware doesn't support the newest features of L and M will have even more.

For Franco kernel, you need to buy the app to be able to customize your settings. For mirage, you actually don't get any customization options... it is set to use the least amount of resources.  Personally, I prefer Franco kernel. It has a lot of options, and the app automatically installs the kernel for you.   Linkme: franco.Kernel updater  And yes, installed Xposed!

It makes the screen go so dim, that you can't hardly use it anymore, so it should be fine for whatever low brightness you desire.   If you want to dim it just a bit lower, you can install Gravity Box and Xposed, which allows you to change the minimum from 20 to 2 or 3.

nexus4,2z3m44,JPEGONE,5,Sun Mar 15 20:54:47 2015 UTC,Did it occur to you while writing that you used N4 for both phones...?
nexus4,2z3m44,Whyareallthegoodname,-1,Mon Mar 16 06:02:20 2015 UTC,no thats the joke... note 4 nexus 4 short-term n4 for both.
nexus4,2z3m44,delongedoug,2,Mon Mar 16 07:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, the battery is the only item that will end up forcing me to get a new phone because I absolutely love my N4 otherwise but worrying if I'm going to make it through the day or if I should charge up a bit before leaving is getting old. I'm doing what I can to help with Greenify, Llama and NFC tags to only use what systems I need."

nexus4,2z3m44,Omnibitent,1 point,Mon Mar 16 11:35:41 2015 UTC,This is false. I've used Moto X 2014 and it's so incredibly smooth in comparison to the Nexus 4. CPU/GPU is still very important. Not to even mention the camera in the Nexus 4....
nexus4,2z3m44,DarKnightofCydonia,12,Thu Mar 19 15:09:35 2015 UTC,That's the upgrade I'm planning on doing. Is the battery and camera worth the $500? Also what version of Android is it on?
nexus4,2z3m44,kubabubba,17,Sun Mar 15 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"I made the exact same upgrade. Honestly the battery life alone is worth the upgrade, it's pretty insane. I never would have dreamed of getting 7 hours of SOT on my nexus 4. That being said, the nexus 4 was a great phone as well, too bad its screen had to crack for me :/"
nexus4,2z3m44,ISaidGoodDey,6,Sun Mar 15 07:28:22 2015 UTC,"It's 4.4 now, should have 5.0.2 Or 5.1 this week"
nexus4,2z3m44,HeadphoneWarrior,8,Sun Mar 15 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was.  I'm also really cheap.  Don't get me wrong, it's a better phone in just about every regard.  I don't root and I can ignore bloatware.  The battery and camera are great but I just expected more considering it's been so long since the nexus 4 came out."

nexus4,2z3m44,lordeddardstark,2,Sun Mar 15 16:08:12 2015 UTC,Maybe
nexus4,2z3m44,DoctorSteve,2,Sun Mar 15 14:20:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you use your phone now. My main reason was because the Nexus 4 was ever so slightly too big for my hand, and the Z3C is way more comfortable despite the seemingly small difference in size. Battery life is great - even though I'm not quite getting the ridiculous SOT+standby others seem to have, I pretty much never have to worry about running out of charge by day's end anymore. Dedicated two-stage camera button is awesome for catching quick snaps, though if I have time, I prefer to unlock and switch to manual. Waterproofness doesn't mean I'm taking it in the pool (though it has survived playing music in the shower a few times), but I don't have second thoughts about taking it out in the rain. Plus now that you can root without losing DRM keys, I certainly don't feel like it lacks anything.  Basically it's a bunch of small differences that together have changed the way I use my phone because there's just a lot less to worry about."
nexus4,2z3m44,Endoroid99,7,Sun Mar 15 14:21:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. Form a guy too broke to upgrade
nexus4,2z3m44,jimmi114,5,Sun Mar 15 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Well you bought the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact, that's why. You bought a phone that is physically identical to the Nexus 4. All the upgrades are internal. The phone is faster, will last you longer, and has a better camera.  But, that's what it IS. I felt the same as you while handling the non-compact Z3. This is why I am setting my sights on the LG G4, as the G3 felt like a physical upgrade to the Nexus 4. A bigger screen in a similarly-sized package.  If you're under the return grace period, maybe keep an eye out for G4 news!"
nexus4,2z3m44,DoctorSteve,2,Sun Mar 15 10:04:36 2015 UTC,"What's the battery life like on the full size z3? My gf just got the compact, its a nice phone, and I'm tired of sod on my n4"
nexus4,2z3m44,themangeraaad,3,Sun Mar 15 18:39:50 2015 UTC,"I had a N4 and a N5. I recently got my wife a Z3C to replace her Iphone 5 and was blown away at the quality, battery lkife, and performance. I ended up getting myself a Z3 to replace my N5 as I was super fed up with the battery life. I can say that I loved my Nexus devices but I find my Z3 to be superior in almost every way. Sonys skin for android is actually really laid back and non intrusive. However the things I notice most are the camera and the battery life. I am a very gi user of my phone. I stream bluetooth audio on LTE and wifi basically all day as I work and do a lot of reddit and twitch streaming. I used to charge my N5 constantly because I could barely get half a day with it. With my Z3 I can go a whole day and have some left over. I used to get anxiety and charge my N5 to full before i went out all the time now I don't worry at all. My wifes Z3c is even better. She has told me a couple times it is wayyy better than her Iphone 5 for battery life. All in all I would say the Z3 is a fantastic phone and the IP rating so it is water proof is an awesome perk. If you have any specific questions I would be happy to answer them as Sony has really made a fan in me with their mobile offerings."
nexus4,2z3m44,LazyCouchPotato,-4,Mon Mar 16 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"I just tried it, didn't buy it. I'd assume it's like any new phone, the battery is pretty good.  Really any new phone's battery is going to be good. Even the Nexus 4, if the battery was replaced, would have really good battery life compared to what we're dealing with.  Don't concern yourself with ""battery life"" when buying a new phone. Battery size, maybe, but not the arbitrary term battery life. Look at the processing power of the device so you can guess how many months it will last you."
nexus4,2z3m44,themangeraaad,5,Mon Mar 16 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"I just got a OPO yesterday and it was definitely worth the upgrade. Battery alone is worth it... Almost 3 hours on battery with 1 hour screen on time and I still have 91% battery? This is awesome.  My biggest concern was the size since I didn't really want a 5.5"" screen but after half hour of using this phone it now feels fine and going back to the N4 feels small. And for the price? I can't complain"
nexus4,2z3m44,Dodgified,2,Mon Mar 16 00:06:00 2015 UTC,Really? Damn. I'm eagerly looking forward to the OnePlus Two now.
nexus4,2z3m44,sinetwo,4,Sun Mar 15 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"I thought about waiting but my N4 was just about useless...  Battery dying at 40%, random loss if signal,  random restarts,  etc...  Pretty much useless.   I figured that if I bought the OPO now I'll probably be able to sell it for at least $200 when the OP2 releases.  Only really lose $150 at most,  and $150 is totally worth having this phone for the next 3-6 months instead of fighting my N4 for that much time.   And honestly unless the OP2 brings some serious improvements I may stick with this anyway.  I never used the IT blaster, wireless charging,  or other features  that this phone is ""missing""  so I'm not exactly bothered by the fact that they are missing...  This performs well enough that I could see myself being happy for at least a year or 2... But I may upgrade to the OP2 just to get a new toy in a few months.  Lol"
nexus4,2z3m44,Zouden,2,Sun Mar 15 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you, got my OPO maybe 3 weeks ago now? The bigger screen was a concern but it feels fine now and the N4 just seems tiny!  The OP2 will have to have something pretty spectacular to make me want to upgrade because I think this phone is just good enough to last a few years at least!"
nexus4,2z3m44,Apathetic_Superhero,2,Sun Mar 15 17:10:12 2015 UTC,Isn't the z4 coming out?
nexus4,2z3m44,TeutonJon78,2,Sun Mar 15 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Later this year. The compact version will probably be out in October, if they make one."
nexus4,2z3m44,TeutonJon78,2,Sun Mar 15 08:08:51 2015 UTC,I've done the same update. Make sure when you take pictures you have it set to manual. Much better pictures that way.
nexus4,2z3m44,matsam,2,Sun Mar 15 10:39:29 2015 UTC,"N4 -> Z3c really isn't that much a change. The CPU/GPU is only like a 0.5 generation higher. Battery, SD card, and size are the really only important upgrades there.  I so wanted a Z3c. If it was like $300-350, I might have done it. Not at $530. I'll wait for the next gen ones and hopefully there is still a compact flagship to be found."
nexus4,2z3m44,matsam,2,Sun Mar 15 16:15:07 2015 UTC,I got mine on swappa for $400 with a few accessories.  It's very much mint.

nexus4,2z3m44,matsam,2,Sun Mar 15 22:30:08 2015 UTC,What?  If the seller didn't like it he wouldn't sell it for less than the going price.  Used phones are a lot cheaper and with a newer used phone it's been used much less.
nexus4,2z3m44,kvaks,2,Sun Mar 15 22:31:10 2015 UTC,"I did the same upgrade and, like you said, while the camera and battery are a huge improvement, I don't feel like it's worth twice as much. Plus, the UI feels snappier on the Nexus 4, perhaps Lollipop has something to do with it."
nexus4,2z3m44,theodeus,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:06:25 2015 UTC,I kind of feel like the Nexus isn't trying to impress with gimmicks which makes it run faster.  This is what makes it impressive!

nexus4,2z3m44,fakehalo,3,Mon Mar 16 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"The Nexus 4 is plenty good enough, still.  Poor battery life is solved (for me, at least) by having wireless QI chargers a few select places (me: office desk and night stand), so that the phone is always charged.   Camera doesn't matter to me. I have a compact mirrorless system camera in my shoulder bag, so I never use the phone's camera. My phone could be missing a camera altogether, and I wouldn't care.   The one thing I do miss, really miss, is proper USB host capabilities (w/ USB OTG cable), so that I could read my camera's SD card and not have to go through a computer. I'm considering upgrading to the Nexus 5 for this reason."

I just want to say that this notion that ""stock = stable"" can be heavily flawed, depending on the device. Very often, the latest factory images are shipped with bugs. The bugs are sometimes addressed internally by the OEM or Google in the case of AOSP, but you won't get the fix until they ship the next factory image. 3rd party ROMs can cherry pick these fixes for immediate builds.

I am not sure how much they cost at the moment but anyways here are my top picks:   Out There - Space strategy game with mining elements and a nice sci-fi story. Plays different each time. Game Dev Story - A game about making games. And destroying your free time. Gurk 3 - Old school style RPG, without a big story dragging it down. Life of a Mobster - Text based adventure with a nice UI and a rich story.    Also since you have Monument Valley, you might want to save up for its DLC. Its way better and difficult (in a good way) from the main 'story' puzzles."
nexus4,2z15o1,JakeyPotter,5,Sat Mar 14 16:39:45 2015 UTC,I'd flash 5.1 and wipe it in the process. All those things sound softwarey rather than hardwarey.

They arranged to have mine picked up and delivered me a refurbished one.  The battery life on the refurbished one is either new or next to new.

nexus4,2z0m65,tylercoder,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:43:18 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm just not giving it enough time/cycles. I've had the current battery in for a week now and I had the first replacement in for maybe a week and a half. Maybe it just needs more time/cycles to settle down.

nexus4,2z0m65,my-shins-itch,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:07:21 2015 UTC,Hi /u/roboobor. How's the charging issue going after 1 month? I believe your new battery has gone through enough cycles. Is it back to normal?  I just replaced the battery on my Nexus 4 (running 5.1) and observed similar issues though not as serious as described in your case. Umm for the past 10 minutes it stayed at 6% all through while keeping the screen on...It's weird around 95%+ and 15%-. but 15%~95% range seems fine. How's yours? Does time really remedy this?
nexus4,2z0fyy,Cowgothardscope,5,Sat Mar 14 12:01:17 2015 UTC,I remember a guy a while back who sanded it all off.   It actually looked pretty good. Gave the phone a clean look. Just be really careful around the glass if you do this.   edit: I don't know why i didn't look up the link. Here it is :)

Oftentimes it can seem like the Services code can go a bit haywire. After the new 5.0 update it was a shockingly huge battery drain until something happened server side and/or a Service update was pushed out. So when we get 5.1 then chances are there may be a settling in period with Services too. Hopefully not though

Maybe the last update we'll get for N4 but if it finally fixes a few unique bugs then that's awesome.)  What they may be doing is releasing it on the newer devices (N7 notwithstanding) to see if they have any other bugs they need to patch. Then they can do another .1 update and try again before getting to our venerable but not first priority devices. Or something.   Not sure, would that save them time and effort? It'll help keep owners of newer Nexus' happier which will keep the blogosphere happy.  I'm happy to see that's there's some meaty bug fixes at least. Granted there's 4 or 5 APN updates or other trivial XML or config updates that aren't functional fixes or updates but a least as many like this camera bugfix that will hopefully make the Nexus 4 better.   Also, with talk of Android M, methinks this will be the last update for the older devices. It'd be a good point to leave them, with a modern refreshed Android, the Windows 7 of Android if you will, before they start another chapter"

But, that's not stock android, and is a slim 5.2"" phone, so maybe quite a bit larger than you want as well.  Anyway, I'd seriously just check Slickdeals, and maybe use the GSM Arena phone finder as well.

Root your phone with WugFresh's toolkit. Go to play store and install 'Nexus 4 LTE Modem Flasher'. I found the YouTube video 'Unlock the hidden LTE data speeds on your nexus 4 phone' to be clearer than the video on the app page. I used 98/33 hybrid modem and now have LTE on T-Mobile on my N4.

With Device Protection, your lost or stolen device will remain locked until you sign in with your Google account - even if someone resets your device to factory settings.

nexus4,2yhgzr,RustyBader,2,Mon Mar 9 21:56:35 2015 UTC,Nexus 4 did not ship with 5.1 and is not listed with the 6 and 9 so it's highly unlikely this will be possible for Nexus 4.

nexus4,2yk0r0,kn1ght,8,Tue Mar 10 16:43:57 2015 UTC,Water evaporates and condenses.  You won't be sure of where it has 'moved' inside the hone until you open it up.
nexus4,2yk0r0,DAVIDSPZGZ,2,Tue Mar 10 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I dropped mine and it submerged completely for a couple of seconds. It is important if the water was fresh or salty/soapy (any other diluted substances). If fresh- generally don't need to clean it, otherwise you probably do because as the water evaporates the impurities stay and may cause short circuits. First thing is to remove the battery. I let mine sit completely covered in rice overnight. My phone still works great."

On 5.0.1, hardly using it brings it down to 80% way before mid-day after unplugging it from the charger around 6:30 am and I need my phone to work and battery has to be the least of my worries when I'm using it cause it is critical to my work. Even my LG G3 has taken a big hit to battery life on 5.0.1 and the G3 was one of the most solid phones for battery life when on KitKat.  I really hope this 5.1 update fixes the battery life on the N4 cause I prefer stock Lollipop over the LG version any day."

nexus4,2yfpm9,Procake,27,Mon Mar 9 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"The issue is related to Google Play services, specifically the  checkin service.  A reboot will temporarily fix the problem.  It may reoccur in 5 minutes of 5 weeks.    A workaround is to return your version of Google Play services to the original version.  Or root your phone and use an application to disable the service causing the problem.  This issue has been around for months.  I'm absolutely furious Google doesn't even acknowledge it as a bug that needs fixing."

nexus4,2yfpm9,shrivel,3,Mon Mar 9 14:48:50 2015 UTC,Check out my thread from a few months ago in /r/cyanogenmod   Given the seriousness of the issue I originally thought it was a bug in Cyanogen.  Turns out it was affecting stock and a couple of other phones.  Unlike Google HTC patched the One in a week or so of the bug being reported.

nexus4,2yfpm9,xenyz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't rooted my phone before, is there a guide I can use to do it that then shows me how to disable the service causing this? Thanks."
nexus4,2yfpm9,ydna_eissua,2,Mon Mar 9 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"Use something like this, or search for Xposed Amplify for more advanced service/wakelock blocking.   There are hundreds of guides on how to get root access, but the biggest problem you'll find is having to wipe all data in order to unlock the boot loader, if it isn't already unlocked.   And if you're going to wipe all data, you could try a factory reset to see if it solves your problem without having root access.   Since it seems related to Play Services, and I've been recommending this to users experiencing a different issue, it may just solve your issue as well. It's worth a try as a first step."
nexus4,2yfpm9,Skollgrimm,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"I chose to go back to the older version of play services.  You can roll it back to stock by going settings --> apps then performing the same process as an uninstall.  Only with system apps you can't uninstall, only roll back to stock.  This is the method I chose to combat this issue.  If you do this you will need to roll back your version of a lot of google apps as well.

nexus4,2yi2v5,aghatak,3,Tue Mar 10 06:41:03 2015 UTC,"Download the factory images, edit the flash-all.sh to remove '-w' from the last command, and push the new OS. That will not delete any of your data. I am rooted and have installed 5.0 and 5.0.1 by this method. I haven't used Nexus Root Toolkit, I have used the method mentioned below:  1. Download the appropriate system image for your device below, then unzip it to a safe directory. 2. Connect your device to your computer over USB. 3. Start the device in fastboot mode with one of the following methods:     a) Using the adb tool: With the device powered on, execute:      adb reboot bootloader      b) Using a key combo: Turn the device off, then turn it on and immediately hold down the relevant key combination for your device. For example, to put a Nexus 5 (""hammerhead"") into fastboot mode, press and hold Volume Up + Volume Down + Power as the device begins booting up.  4. Open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped system image directory. Execute the flash-all script with the deletion of '-w' in appropriate command. This script installs the necessary bootloader, baseband firmware(s), and operating system."

There are better options for similar prices, I'm not going to go into a bunch of detail because there have been a ton of these posts, just search for them. The camera, however, is dreadful. I thought a lot of people were being dramatic about it when I first bought the phone a couple years ago, but the camera really does suck, except in the best of lighting conditions.

This happens both on the charger and off the charger for me.  I'm hoping they fixed it on 5.1 along with the camera crashes.

nexus4,2yfcr5,Miggol,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:23:49 2015 UTC,"You should avoid charging by USB until you get it up and running again. I once had a scare like this and holding the power button while plugged in forced a full turn-off which got it back in the charging state.

nexus4,2ybrgx,TwinnieH,2,Sun Mar 8 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a Moto G would almost certainly do what I need because we're simply into ""shiny new toy"" here vs. the N4 not being up to the job.

I jumped the gun and actually already have the Note 4 Tech Armor Ballistic Glass and the Samsung case on my desk but I'm not sure if I'll finally pull the trigger on it yet with the G4 coming out soon and other choices. I just feel like the Note 4's power, removable battery + SD slot, huge screen and display draw me in most. Will the G4 have these features?  Sadly, fear of tripping Knox with my Note 4 when rooting scares me the most. Unless people figure out a way to ""re-seal"" Knox without the reseal method being undone."

The experience is smooth and aesthetically pleasing, something I can't personally say about Lollipop. I ultimately made the switch because my N4 suffered from the sleep of death 5-6 times a day and became extremely difficult to use. The one thing I won't miss about my N4? The camera.

I would lose like 10% battery per restart and it would sometimes restart 3/4 times a day. my screen got a dead patch. This is irrelevant to the N4 but that was the main reason for the upgrade.   If the N5 wasn't so expensive and didn't seem like it would forever be £300 i would have gone to that in a heart beat.  TL;DR - I fucking loved my N4 but its battery life and bugs led to its demise"

Also, Google killed Wallet on jellybean, and Okay Google everywhere never worked on anything but KitKat so currently I'm on 4.4.4 at least until 5.1 comes out and Xposed lollipop is stable.

nexus4,2y9to7,Kichigai,4,Sun Mar 8 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"I have no plans to replace my Nexus 4, but it does have some issues. Fortunately they're all in software, but they're incredibly egregious. Battery life is abysmal, GPS sometimes won't lock (even though it'll see several satellites) and the Sleep of Death is almost intolerable. In many ways I'm reminded of when the Nexus S got Ice Cream Sandwich and it just ruined the phone's performance.  All that being said, I'm quite impressed with how the phone has held up all this time. I'm notoriously rough on my tech, up until a few months ago I ran the phone completely naked, without a case. Sure I busted the screen twice, and the back is a total mess, but I'm more impressed that the tech inside is still fulfilling my needs.  It's the first phone I've ever owned that's remained fully functional, and providing satisfactory performance, more than two years into its life. My Blackberry Curve 8900 at 18 months was incapable of making or receiving phone calls or text messages at this point (restricting communications to Google Voice, as Internet was the only thing that worked right), my Nexus S was unbearably slow (no matter what ROM I loaded on to it), and my T-Mobile Dash (HTC Excalibur/s620) would refuse to reconnect to cell networks if lost contact at any point. And we won't even get into the library of non-smart phones I had before that with their myriad of issues (like randomly dialing 911).  Meanwhile, the Nexus 4, except for its somewhat buggy firmware (random reboots in some firmware versions, SnapChat-related stability issues, and recent issues with Lollipop) has managed to hang in there, even with me digging around in its guts so I could replace the screen. The only other phone that has matched its longevity is my Nokia N73 (bought in 2007, still my backup phone). LG built a fantastic chunk of tech to follow up on a device that had somewhat soured me on Android phones (the Nexus S) and marked the first time I bought two phones in a row that ran the same OS."

I highly doubt you'd encounter any problems because of 300mb of free ram since that can cover a number of new applications running (maybe not an intense game though). So you're not "" running low "" on ram and it seems like android is managing it fairly well, but if you're having problems with lag or restarts a factory reset or clean install can help.

Replaced my screen with a non-OEM one and it didn't have the piece of paper/foam that made the light less annoying. Dropped that phone and had to replace the screen again, bought OEM this time and was back to the small subtle light."
nexus4,2xspxj,gmr2048,8,Tue Mar 3 18:30:39 2015 UTC,Where did you get an OEM screen?
nexus4,2xspxj,AddNomAndHim,4,Tue Mar 3 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"At the suggestion of somebody somewhere on Reddit, I got it from etradesupply.com since they are (allegedly) a listed OEM provider of LG screens for the N4.   That said, the right 25% of the screen/digitizer failed within a month, and I had to contact them for a replacement. This just so happened to be at the beginning of Chinese New Year, so they were closed for ~2 weeks. This morning I got an email from them saying the screen is out of stock and they don't know if/when it will be back in, so they want to refund the $75 purchase price.   So I've been without my main phone for well over a month and now have to source a new screen. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend them (even if they could provide a genuine OEM screen)!"

It had the obnoxiously large notification light and was noticeably less accurate touch-wise than my original screen. That's why I went (tried to go!) OEM for the second replacement. Still deciding on what to do next. There are several ""OEM""s listed on ebay, but I doubt their actual OEM-ness. Tho their sellers have thousands of transactions and 98+% feedback. So I might just try that."

After that, try to mount the sdcard partition with the shell commands. To access the Android shell type adb shell and then you will be in control of your phone.  I think you can remount the partition like if it was another Linux machine. Look up the help of the android shell commands for mounting partitions"
nexus4,2xszcg,kauron,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that advice- I'm not sure why adb couldn't see it before, but it was able to interface now. The error I'm seeing, as some more searching has uncovered, is because CWM doesn't like how the Nexus 4 doesn't have a physical SD card. I was able to Sideload with ADB after formatting /data/, and successfully flashed the image.  Too bad I misunderstood the version, and found to my chagrin that  it was only a developer preview (just the interface and a bunch of fake notifications).   I ended up installing the latest release through Canonical's Ubuntu directions from a Trusty Live CD. That was much easier than buggering with the windows tools."
nexus4,2xszcg,kauron,2,Thu Mar 5 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"If you are interested in reinstalling or getting updates for the Ubuntu ROM you could use MultiROM, which you can install in an Android ROM to setup Ubuntu as a secondary ROM so that you don't brick your phone in the process (it is actually possible to break it, but the odds are lower). You can even install other ROM's as secondary to try them.  If you give it a try, it installs a modded TWRP to do the process, so you will lose the CWM recovery.

nexus4,2xpadk,xenyz,3,Mon Mar 2 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Technically, if you only flash the boot partition and don't root the phone, OTA updates should work, as the system partition has not been modified.   Be aware that some custom kernels make changes to the system partition as well. Mirage does not.   However, it's a much better experience to have things like Ad Away, CF.Lumen, Titanium Backup, Viper4Android, Xposed, etc. which all  require root access.   OTA updates won't work with root, but downloading and flashing the factory image for infrequent updates is quick and easy enough."

nexus4,2xjah8,LoThro,2,Sun Mar 1 17:44:18 2015 UTC,Its not bricked. I once formatted my phone and manually removed all files ( hidden or not ) . My phone then got bricked and wouldn't boot. I managed to fix it completely by manually mounting it on a Linux machine and dealing with it as a USB device and that got me some access through adb and I managed to flash a recovery and install a ROM.  Maybe you could try this if all else fails.

nexus4,2xjah8,IMMatthu,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:30:18 2015 UTC,"yes  Rename file to gapps.zip Hold shift in the folder with gapps, right click and open terminal adb push gapps.zip /sdcard/ This uses adb push to send gapps.zip to /sdcard/"
nexus4,2xjah8,IMMatthu,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"First question: what happens when you format /data? It sounds like /data may have lost something (selinux context?) And that's causing a problem.  Power it down. Hold vol down + power (gets you to bootloader).  If at this point it won't come up as a device, check the USB port for lint, grab a different cable, try a different port on your PC (does a flash drive work?)  use the volume rocker to get to recovery.   If that works, it's pa5 being lost. Had this happen, no big deal.  Wipe everything. I mean everything.  Use adb sideload to install the pa5 ROM. This will let you install Roms using only a PC. Use the micro gApps, sideload them too.  If that doesn't work, adb push (ROM) /tmp/ should.  I'm guessing you tried the stock gApps 5 package. Its too big."

We're on 5.0 now the navbar its still there and barely any apps add more functions, the menu button was moved to the upper material bar and all the navbar does is rotate the back icon at times.  I removed the navbar in 4.2 and added LMT, never looked back. Don't know what you were using for PIE but LMT runs really fast once you adjust the sensitivity.

Got my N4 jan 2013 and I love it to shreds and its kept its end on so much but having to reboot it everytime I get in my car on top of the infrequent dialer mute bug has me at the end of my tether.

nexus4,2xd153,Chewie_CO,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"No worries. I think it is a little a both, IMO.  During one of these episodes I did get the red light of death, but was still able to get it to turn back on. Flashing CM12 on mine fixed the SoD on my device, but caused some instabilities elsewhere. I am now running stock after a complete reformat and reflash (via adb) and have only had a couple SoD. I did this about 6 weeks back, so I am pretty happy with the results.  I can't speak to downgrading as I have stuck through it to stay on Lollipop. I will say that I didn't have this issue before Lollipop so there is probably some merit to the idea."

It isn't a straight upgrade, though; there is not wireless charging, and the OS is currently 4.4.4, though there is a pretty stable lollipop rom that CM has developed you can find on the xda forums.

nexus4,2x9ddu,turtleoftime,3,Thu Feb 26 20:51:21 2015 UTC,You broke the power button.
nexus4,2x9ddu,Whyareallthegoodname,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:28:47 2015 UTC,This is what I was afraid of.  I'm thinking of getting a replacement button.  How certain are you that the power button is broken?
nexus4,2x9ddu,turtleoftime,2,Thu Feb 26 21:36:52 2015 UTC,Sorry. Was thinking of gnex. Anyways. Yes it fits in a slot. Noticed I had lodged mine up and out of place slightly. Being able to get into fast boot but not being able to make a selection is indicative of a broken button.
