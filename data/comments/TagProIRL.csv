Apparently you can get external sound adapters that just plug in via USB for like $6 that should work with your headphones/external speakers (I guess).

I mention it whenever someone asks about similar games or team games, or just free online games that are fun.   Here's a write up I did about it in a similar thread recently:    ARC! Also known as Armor Critical and Spark.   Long storied history, but it's community is dying due to lack of publicity and I think the owners are more interested in purchasing advertisement than committing to grow the user base by word of mouth through interested communities. That and the user base isn't as open to new folks as it used to be, as most of the players are now veteran. I think /r/ webgamers would like it though.  That said, it's an awesome game!  Short but sweet description:  Top down capture the flag (or deathmatch or control points) with slow moving spaceships. Very simple controls (WASD or arrows, mouse to shoot with primary and secondary weapons, mousewheel to choose between the 3 secondaries). Work together as a team and outsmart and outshoot your opponents.  It's been around a long time, so there are plenty of guides to get you caught up. Here's the link:  Armor Critical"

I don't even need to get into the whole ""Its your money/life/whatever thing"". But I figure at least one person should ask you if that sounds like a reasonable thing.

CDC would be on lockdown and go through there ""Zombie"" protocols because they do have one.  The outbreak would end before it began. So maybe, just maybe, I might have to sit indoors for a few days while the National Guard does hourly sweeps if I'm in a hotzone.   However, if its airborne and everyone is already contaminated aside from the few who are immune. Well in all likelyhood I'd be fucked already. But if I were to be one of the few. I'd drive to my cousins house a few days after the chaos is over. Get his guns, and travel to the mountains where we have our family cabin and set up numerous traps. Continuously dig a big ass hole/moat for them to fall in so I can kill them with ease. All the while, making continous runs into neighboring towns to check for survivors and aquire a long-distance HAM radio for my news, food and other various supplies. Once I'm in my domain, no need for guns. All melee at that point so i'd have to stay fairly hydrated. Hope for rain."

World War Z zombies are the most op zombies and still i cant believe they would be in more than two cities and then taken down by militair.  But when i would be in those cities i would just make sure my house is safe and dont leave before its over.  Hmm also i would check on all my friends and family and for sure check the internet what is on there about it.

(I kid, kinda)  Truthfully though, what I hear is that you're terrified of rejection and failure.  You've always chosen the safe thing, and you're calling it laziness, but I'm not so sure.  What I'm hearing is more like apprehension - that you might go all out for something and not be enough.  No one's ever enough BBQ.  Ever.  Putting yourself out there and failing is the best thing you could ever do, because the more you do that, the more you'll realize that it's survivable.  There's an odd grace that comes with repeatedly facing the worst thing in the world.  The emperor has no clothes.  I struggle with similar things all the time BBQ - not the same things - but similar ones.  Laziness is really just a cleaner word for avoidance.  Figure out why you avoid, then challenge it.  Face the thing that makes you uncomfortable."
TagProIRL,3d75k0,brent12345,3,Tue Jul 14 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure whether or not I want to post it anymore.  I had a really good talk with a close friend last night about the whole thing and I'm feeling much more at ease today.  If anything I'd show it to her before posting to Facebook but that post is kind of in the past for me at this point and I'm not sure how much I really need to revisit it.  Anyways, I think you got it right with it really being fear of failure.  It's hard to get over, certainly it's going to take a while, but I guess so does anything worthwhile."

The most difficult thing about life is learning to live in gratitude and accept that you are exactly where you should be.  Your perceived laziness, etc.. are just your personal challenges.  We all have them.     The key is to accept who you are, weaknesses and all, and learn to love yourself for them.  And to take your challenges one day at a time, one moment at a time.

They thought the current would cover it well enough but a survey showed not enough coverage on top of the pipe and they don't want to wait. So we're basically reverse dredging now - going back over the pipeline and dumping in enough sand to bring the depth on top of the pipe equal to or greater than the depth of the surrounding ocean floor. We're filling in an area about 50 feet wide except for the connection to the pipeline and the exit pit, which are like 100 feet wide by 200 feet long each.  It was so good.

TagProIRL,3bz4ys,ko890317,4,Fri Jul 3 13:24:54 2015 UTC,"Ok - I'm back, and I do apologize for the downtime.  I did spend time with my family, and it was amazing, so I don't feel too bad.  I was Reddit-friends with /u/krispykrackers before she became an admin, so did have interaction with her when she was in that position.  I (either personally or through one of our spam-fighter mods have had numerous occasions to ping the admins with questions about users, suspected rings / groups, and a few other things.  I believe that I got 1 reply, from /u/cupcake1713 about suspected vote manipulation or brigading.  I think other than that I've never heard a peep from them.  They did buy us all a year of gold, a package of stickers, and give us a jpg of thanks or something a ways back.  I pm'd Krispy a few times when I didn't get a reply form the request to the admins and I'm pretty sure she replied back to all of those.  I suppose I'd chalk up my personal experience as one of feeling left out and ignored.  We have asked for big-picture things that would help us across the board and for small, specific things that would help us out with a single incident or ongoing problem like domain spamming, but they really haven't done what we've asked.  I will be totally honest, I understand where it stems from.  If I could ask 100 of you to take five minutes a day and do something for me, and you don't mind because it helps build something you grew (think a game you built, or a subreddit that you were passionate about), then isn't that 'better' than me hiring 1 person to work 480 minutes a day to do it?  They've distributed the labor, but when I needed a tiny toothbrush to polish the gunk off of my subreddit, we were good to go.  Now that we've got a huge community, and we are targeted by spammers and a host of other (frankly) cancerous elements, that toothbrush isn't nearly as helpful as if an admin rode by one day and passed out a few shovels.  We aren't asking for much - hell, much of the infrastructure and functionality already exist in the forms of bots, 3rd party tools, etc, we just want them to work on them in-house so we can get the benefit of everything they do know about.  Sorry so long - as I said - I'm back for a few days, so am happy to answer follow-up or other questions."

TagProIRL,3au032,bdubyageo,3,Tue Jun 23 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"Ii–V–I progression:       The ii–V–I progression (occasionally referred to as ii–V–I turnaround, and ii–V–I) is a common cadential chord progression used in a wide variety of music genres, including jazz harmony. It is a succession of chords whose roots descend in fifths from the second degree (supertonic) to the fifth degree (dominant), and finally to the tonic. In a major key, the supertonic triad (ii) is minor, and in a minor key it is diminished. The dominant is, in its normal form, a major triad and, commonly, a dominant seventh chord. With the addition of chord alterations, substitutions, and extensions (most often sevenths), limitless variations exist on this simple formula.

Some things that really annoy me are when people are really self centered/ego driven, when people smell really bad, and when my computer lags. Out of the three, I'd say the smell thing I encounter least frequently so I'd make that the third.   I hit the bomb multiple times daily.

TagProIRL,3atl1b,wrektlol,2,Tue Jun 23 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"ACL injury sucks. I don't know how much my words would help but I'll try.   Here's some bad news for you. ACL injury is strongly associated with development of osteoarthritis. Keep this in mind when you are doing rehab. As grueling and boring rehab will be, you have to do it properly so you avoid getting a knee implant when you are in your 30s, revision surgery in the 50s, and another revision in the 70s. Each successive revisions will not only cost money, but also compromise bone quality surrounding the implant, increasing the susceptibility to fracture.   Now the scary news is over, here are some good news. Many who have suffered ACL injury don't develop osteoarthritis with proper rehab and they resume to the competitive sports in about a year. Think of Derrick Rose. Or even Hines Ward, who played his entire NFL career without ACL. Use the time in rehab to master non-weight beating exercises, in this case is mostly swimming. At one point you'll find yourself on a stationary bike a lot. So when you are fully healthy, combined with your experience in cross country, get into triathlon! Also request those MRI images and surgery video for your own personal memoir. Good luck!"
TagProIRL,3atl1b,ko890317,2,Tue Jun 23 12:52:46 2015 UTC,"Those are the examples you went with? What about the greatest return from ACL EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. ADRIAN 'MOFUCKING' PETERSON.   He tore his ACL AND MCL in week 16 of the 2012 season and was back on the field for OTAs in early June. That's going from arthroscopic surgery to ankle-breaking, ligament-tearing cuts at full speed in SIX MONTHS.   Oh yeah also he was unanimously voted the NFL's MVP the next year.

TagProIRL,3atl1b,ko890317,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:25:05 2015 UTC,"Well, you also have to remember the Steelers defensive back Rod Woodson who tore his ACL mid-season and came back to play in the Super Bowl. Sure, he played well, but he totally ruined the surgery he got before and had to get it redone. I'm just worried because I don't want to further cripple myself after this. There's no rush, but I understand that some people do recover quicker than others, which good for him, that's impressive af :P"

My orthopedist did mention taking tissue out of my knee to make a replacement, so I shall heed to your forewarning. To address your second point, I have already been planning rehab schedules for my knee. Swimming, stationary bike, and leg lifts are the golden triad of exercises that will accelerate this rehab. I appreciate your advice, and I'll keep you updated :D"
TagProIRL,3atl1b,BeastMode3333,2,Tue Jun 23 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"We don't often get opportunities to redefine ourselves, but perhaps this is yours.    You were on a course where sports defined you - it sounds like every season was filled up with a sport or activity, and, in the absence of that, you might feel like your identity is gone for 8 months.  But this is actually a blessing in disguise - you have a chance now to develop other parts of your personality.  A chance many people don't get, because they're expected to continue on in the areas they already excel.  Use this year as a chance to really throw yourself into another pursuit, the way you used to throw yourself into sports.  Your rehab will still be a big part of your time, but you mentioned music - perhaps now you can really reach expert mode - what's your instrument?  Or maybe this is the year you become a serious writer, or the year you get interested in film.  You might emerge from this year with a totally different direction, or maybe not - but that's the fun of it!  Good luck and let us know what you wind up doing with your time :)"

TagProIRL,3ai7a3,djcookie187187187187,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:21:46 2015 UTC,"I perform all the time (music major).   Recently, I sang lead in a barbershop quartet and for the week before I was petrified. In rehearsal I'd done okay but the thought of singing on stage in front of people was horrifying. I once froze on stage during a solo in 3rd grade and that haunted me since then.   Usually, I play saxophone and there's a stand in front of me with my music but singing is another monster in itself. Especially with guitar since you've got to play two instruments at once- it's not as easy as people make it to be.   What I did was practice practice practice practice practice. You don't want to practice until you get it right, you practice until you can't get it wrong.   I remember when my quartet was going on after the choir sang and I couldn't remember the second verse at all. Once I started the song, muscle memory kicked in and I did fine. That's what you want in a performance. Just like athletes practice their pitch, or swing for consistency. Once you're comfortable with that, you can add in your flair to make not be a robot.   Also, when I played competitively I always worried about messing up, which lead me mess up, then I though about how and why I messed up, which caused me to mess up more. Mistakes happen, to er is human or whatever, but don't let it get to you- just keep going and finish strong."

TagProIRL,3aesdn,eatfrenchfries,8,Sat Jun 20 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"I found out your name and where you lived, researched all public and private schools within a 20 mile area of your residence, impersonated an English high school curriculum specialist, went through all your schools' records to determine what classes you were in each year, retrieved the syllabus and reading list for each semester, facebook friended all your friends (they all accepted once we found out I ""went to kindergarten with them omg our parents are like best friends"") to determine if you had actually read each book on the syllabus, played Tagpro for 800 hours and multiple seasons, and then co-founded a book club, prayed you would join, and rigged the voting so our reading list would contain books you read in high school  Huh. That's a weird coincidence."

TagProIRL,3a6zl3,I_mess_up,4,Wed Jun 17 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"I used to get migraines super frequently. At least once a week from 4th-7th grade. I got them often enough that i would go to school knowing that by the end of the school day I would probably throw up, because I couldn't afford to miss that many days.  My typical procedure was to take a hot shower, pop some advil, drink an uncomfortable amount of water, then take a nap. I almost always woke up feeling better. Also throwing up generally made me feel better but, you know...I probably don't recommend it."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,KobeMaybe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Well, I threw up several hours ago (through my nose!) then rested and even thallus ate dinner and I'm feeling a lot better now!"
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,MisterGone5,5,Thu Jun 18 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"I've gotten chronic migraines for about 7 years now. Their frequency changes every so often, with my longest stretch without one being roughly a month, and their most frequent being 2-3 times a week.   The best thing I can say to do is medicate AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If I let a migraine fester for more than even 20 minutes, it's here to stay for a few hours minimum. If you can get medicine in you early enough, it can severely cut down the pain and the length of the migraine.  Closing your eyes, blocking the windows, eliminating harsh sounds, and ice packs are all good ways to mitigate the pain. Something that works for me that I haven't heard much about, so it may be JUST me, but in addition to those above, a fan on low-medium pointed at my head helps quite a bit. I also play soft ambient music or nature sounds as well, seems to help me.  If you can find a way to fall asleep, that can also help, considering you won't be conscious for the most painful part of the migraine.   Hope you feel better! If they start to occur more frequently, I would highly suggest asking your family doctor for a neurological exam referral. It what I did and they've definitely been helping me.  Ninja edit: DRINK WATER. LOTS OF IT."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,ProTagonist_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:22:00 2015 UTC,I took ibuprofen but next time if I start to have symptoms I will take it at the start instead of waiting until later to use the medicine.  I was actually able to sleep for part of it too!
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,swagpotato,2,Thu Jun 18 12:38:38 2015 UTC,if it makes you feel any better i also get migraines
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,fooize,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"I got one a few months ago with no headache really, just blurred vision and numbness on the right side of my body. We went to the normal doctor and the eye doctor and they both said it was just a migraine.   This time I actually got a headache and I vomited. That has relieved most or all of the pain."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,125groove125,3,Wed Jun 17 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude, happens to me. I find paracetamol+codeine works the best. In Australia, you can only get that in 500mg+15mg tablets without a prescription but 2 of those tablets work. They will make you feel slower than usual so just be mindful of that.  I find that I get migraines when I haven't really been drinking enough water throughout the day. So try keeping your fluids up and you should be alright. Even then, I do still get migraines once ever 2-3 months. Also be cautious of coffee and chocolate (and a few other things that you can probably research about), they can stimulate a migraine just by being delicious."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,125groove125,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. It seems like dehydration may have been a leading cause. I went for a run in hot weather and might not have gotten enough water afterward.   I'm not sure if they sell codeine OTC in the U.S. but I have some ibuprofen so I'm gonna use that. Besides, I want to stay away from opiates if I can."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,Lysozyme_,2,Wed Jun 17 18:55:36 2015 UTC,They most definitely sell codeine OTC in the US. Try to get it without APAP. 50mg of codeine is effective for me but if you're taking 1.5g of paracetamol (APAP) regularly you're going to fuck up your liver.
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,Lysozyme_,2,Wed Jun 17 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"Stay off the computer/tv/books, take some ibuprofen, drink caffeine (will help open up your blood vessels and relieve some of the pain), and close my eyes. Migraines suck. Water helps sometimes, especially if you have coffee/coke for caffeine--stay hydrated."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,MostDeaths,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'll try some more ibuprofen (I vomited the first bit), thanks. :) And other than checking this ever 20 minutes I am staying off of screens."
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,halfmoon_kid,2,Tue Jun 23 04:39:40 2015 UTC,"I also notice that I get migraines when I don't sleep well or am really stressed, so maybe try to focus on that bit of your life once this one goes away. Good luck :)"
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,RubberDuckKeychains,2,Wed Jun 17 19:26:00 2015 UTC,"Do you have the weird aura thing with it? I used to have migraines with scintillating scotoma from around 15-19 years old, about once a month at the start then decreasing it frequency.  It would start where I would notice I had a small blind spot directly where I was looking, for example if I was reading, I would not be able to see the word I was looking at, only the ones around it. Then the blind patch would spread always to the left and up over about an hour, so for my example I would only see the word not the rest of the sentence. Just as the blind patch gets near to the edge of my vision the migraine would come and last for about the rest of the day. It would also made me throw up when the migraine first appears.  I was prescribed Ibuprofen and Metoclopramide and just lie in bed in the dark for hours trying to sleep. Luckily because the eye stuff always happened before the headache I had that early-warning signal to get my ass home and in bed :D  For whatever reason I haven't had them for nearly 2 years, they stopped around the time I went to university, I was really worried about getting them at uni and thankfully they just never came!  This kind of blindness, but progressing like this just to the top left and over a longer time. It's a bit hard to explain lol  Anyway sorry for the life story, hope you feel better :D"
TagProIRL,3a6zl3,FaithNHumanityStatus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"You just described pretty much what happens with my vision, except it goes up and right.   I also get tingling on the right side of my body first in my hand, then my mouth, then my tongue, then my throat.   Today I took some ibuprofen, vomited (including the ibuprofen), then took some more ibuprofen. I'm feeling almost back to normal now and hoping that the dinner I ate will stay down."
