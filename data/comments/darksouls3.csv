It really made the world feel connected like you really were fading in and out of other worlds.  Expand on that.  There's dozens of things you could do with this concept, which I think is brilliant.  I've often wondered about say a location in the game that was particularly ""unstable"" and you would just automatically run into other players who were there sort of like Journey.  Not a major part of the game, but placed there to help emphasize this concept."
darksouls3,3e40fh,Chettlar,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yes! There are so many creative ways one can create online mechanics to make untraditional multiplayer interactions, I think it's part of the reason why the souls series stands out so much from most other games. The ghosts makes everyone feel so connected even if you're just going through the PvE, and the bloodstains are a magnificent mechanic that can alert players to danger, or give them a quick laugh! One other mechanic I've failed to note is the petrified statues of other players, it's been said before but what if hitting a statue like that had some effect for the other person?"
darksouls3,3e40fh,Chettlar,2,Tue Jul 21 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"What if, petrifying let you live for just a couple seconds, but if your statue was smacked by another player within that time, you would be freed again in your world.  Just an idea.  I'm trying to think of ways you could extend that that would be annoying.  Oh! I thought of another one.  What about a certain traveling merchant that would show up rarely in your game at completely random locations as a phantom.  And some how interacting with him could affect when he shows up in other people's worlds.  He mostly sells items that you can get normally in the game but are very rare.  In my mind I'm envisioning him kinda like good old ""Aye siwae."""
darksouls3,3e40fh,Chettlar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"Ooooh nice! Love the idea of the traveling merchant. What if petrification halves your HP, but every player that cuts down their version of your statue increases your max hp til it's full again?"

It's beneficial to you as the victim rather than annoying.  And you could make it beneficial to the other person and do like my red phantom idea I had in the past (made a thread about it), where real people phantoms have a chance of dropping loot that is on their person.  Do the same for petrified statues.  They have a chance of dropping some of the loot of the person petrified.  So it's a symbiotic relationship in  this case."

Imagine if there was something called, say, ""The Eternal Battlefield"" (obviously something more poetic), and all players would be able to harm each other - but there were also groups of NPCs running around that they could fight as well. It'd be neat to run around something huge and insane like that.  I'd love more puzzles too, though."

Perhaps we could marry the two ideas then and have other players who are also playing get joined up with you automatically.  Both fighting with you and against you, depending on which side they choose to fight for."

It has 2 heads, which function as both a mouth and an anus to which it lays eggs via asexual reproduction and makes an ear piercing roar when its enraged. It will try to eat you, throw electricity at you, throw creepy off-springs to chip your hp. Its the grossest, nastiest monster ever.

If you use fast weapons, he will stay behind a shield and use a spear or something to protect himself while hitting you.  Or something similar, perhaps even more enemy types like this, that adapt to your playstyle, perhaps even after you kill it one time, next time he will use something else to defeat you. I just want a better AI and more interesting NPC's, because they mostly seem stupid and using the same things over and over no matter your playstyle, so making them adapt a bit to your character would be what i really want, to make them feel more alive."

If there was a specific weapon that did that (like say the scimitars kinda are) with the ready stance then i'd be ok with it. But completely different weapons? Doesn't really fit into it. It's not like in bloodborne you could switch from logarius wheel to blades of mercy mid swing...
darksouls3,3e3ki0,elementalwalruss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think there are some things you can pulls from Bloodborne that would still be appropriate.  I think they confirmed from the demo when the control scheme screen was up that you could charge heavy attacks, but I can't remember.  But if so, that's something Bloodborne did that makes sense to be in the game regardless of BB's existence."
darksouls3,3e3ki0,Chettlar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well, of course and i don't disagree on that. Actually i thought BB was kinda interesting with healing of invaders and hosts, but you could parry them while doing that and opening them up for a visceral attack. Also, backstabs could only be done with a charged attack. I thought that was interesting and i think DS3 could take advantage of this experiments to improve it's own gameplay. But, there is a different thing in improving it and just copy-pasting it.  I also would like it if, for example, some form of dash made it into DS3, but slower than BB, instead of rolling, because i for one find it kinda stupid, for lack of other words, that you can just roll into havel's with an ultra greatsword and greatshield and get up as fast as you do, not to mention actually being viable in combat instead of the enemy just sitting on you and preventing you from getting up. A dash would make more sense, in that you are already standing upright and can move more to the left/right/behind or towards your enemy, without making impossible moves."
darksouls3,3e3ki0,elementalwalruss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:03 2015 UTC,"Well what if you did something like the dark wood grain ring, but do what a bunch of people have suggested and make that separate from normal rings.  have a ring that ninja flips (but needs super low weight to use), and then a ring that lets you dash with slightly less weight restrictions.   but you could parry them while doing that and opening them up for a visceral attack   WAIT WHAT."
darksouls3,3e3ki0,Chettlar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I could get behind that. A ring with ninja flips, but another that for example if you have at most 50% weight you can dash. I like it, especially if it will feel weightier than BB. I just kinda find rolling useless to be honest. I highly doubt they were ever used in fights. Mostly because, if you wanted to have any kind of speed, you needed to be pretty flexible and not full with armor. Though tbh i just like the idea of dashes over rolling... Especially in heavy armor. Maybe there should be a break point after which you can't roll anymore (which makes sense).  I just found this http://kotaku.com/dark-souls-dodge-roll-would-get-you-killed-in-real-life-1641298311 don't really like kotaku that much, but this article is good.  Yeah, i noticed in some PvP streams that if a player heals, the other can parry him and he will stop healing and open up for visceral attacks."
darksouls3,3e3ki0,elementalwalruss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of a role is that your jumping out of the way of an attack and then roling so that you can recover.  I haven't played Bloodborne enough to know which I prefer.     Yeah, i noticed in some PvP streams that if a player heals, the other can parry him and he will stop healing and open up for visceral attacks.   I need to try that.  That is a fantastic mechanic."

darksouls3,3e3ki0,MisterKaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"Well, not really... Running while crouched would still be faster than rolling if you want to evade an attack, not to mention that the building-tall swords would catch you during your recovery time. Also, getting into a roll would be fast, but actually recovering from it took time, especially if in heavy armor, not to mention that unless the terain was flat and soft, you would actually hurt yourself quite a lot. I mean, just try jumping on the floor like the fast roll from DS1. If you don't break your neck, your arms and shoulders will definitely hurt or get dislodged since you put your whole weight on them. Imagine doing that on a hilly terain or stairs."

To me it seems like its not worth the tradeoff, especially when Bloodborne was sort of the same way, and look at how many weapons we got in that game.   I would rather them focus on one weapon art per weapon class or something along those lines, to enhance variety, but still give us a lot of choice as far as the amount of weapons go."

Cleric Beast  Gascoigne. Starts off as one of the typical imbalanced NPC hunters (i.e. infinite Quicksilver bullets and much greater health than the PC) that are everywhere. He's slightly larger and a bit easier to deal with. Then he essentially turns into the Cleric Beast. Use a pistol, parry his attacks, and this strategy can be repeated for every humanoid boss.  Vicar Amelia. Cleric beast + Occasional heal and shockwave.  Darkbeast Paarl. Cleric beast + Shockwave  Micolash. NPC that has to rely on ads. You basically just find him and kill him over and over. One of the most boring bosses I've ever seen.  Witch of Hemwick. NPC that relies on ads, you find them and kill them and like Micolash just avoid their pitiful attacks every now and then.   Rom. Same as above, kill the spiders by baiting one at a time. You can literally just run left to right to avoid every single one of Rom's attacks.   Shadows. Actually a good boss fight 10/10. Did group boss battle really well, a huge improvement on the Ornstein and Smough idea from DS1.  Bloodborne did a lot really well but I do not think the bosses were good at all. Many were repeats of the same formula with very little variation and they tended to spam the exact same attacks over and over.  Hell, One Reborn, Paal and Logarius can be fucked due to their pathetic poise and ease of staggering. I killed Paal today with my Arcane build (50 Arcane) using an Arcane Cane +6 (Arcane triangle gem). Just kept wacking away at him and giving myself a little bit of time to get my stamina back (Only had 14 points in Vit and End) and he never got up.  EDIT: Wow a lot of people didn't like this comment."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,-5,Tue Jul 21 07:46:42 2015 UTC,Since DaS2 is full of humanoid so BB have to compensate with its share of monster bosses. People love the monsters tho.
darksouls3,3e0c78,Mayomori,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:56 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the monsters but sometimes I found their design actually got in the way of good gameplay.  Like, for most bosses in DS1 and DS2 I can read their attacks and what they're about to do. However a lot of the beast bosses in BB have so much crap going on all over them that it can be difficult to read their upcoming attack.    A good example I think is how Vicar Amelias hair will actually obscure her swipes if you're behind her."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:21:44 2015 UTC,"I think that's more of a byproduct of ""big monster, little camera"" syndrome the Souls series in general has. The camera wasn't great when you were fighting Manus, it wasn't great when you were fighting Sinh, it wasn't great fighting Cleric Beast. I'm no game designer so I can't say I have a solution, but man, there has gotta be a better way to do the camera work than how it's done currently. At least certain bosses pull your view distance a little further out, like Velstadt."
darksouls3,3e0c78,ninthbelief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:31:38 2015 UTC,"I agree somewhat, I think its a mix. You definitely got this problem with bosses such as Manus but he was a pretty straight forward design. He didn't have giblets flying all over the place and blood showering across your camera constantly.  I think the camera needs improvement and that the bosses need to be relatively simple in design. Like, instead of a dog whose hair is made out of wacky inflatable arm flailing tube men and has intestines draped across his shoulders, maybe just a dog with visible bones/muscle?"
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind the hair physics, I think in extremely bad cases like Amelia it was a design choice to make it a little more tedious to sit on her ass like you do for most Souls bosses, and I never felt it was intrusive aside from that particular instance.  I'll argue against Manus' not having giblets flying all over the place -- he had a huge ass arm and plenty of telegraphing that was simply outside your camera view unless you fought him in an incredibly specific way, heaven forbid you try fighting him locked on -- he might not've had hair physics or blood spraying like a Kill Bill movie, but he was definitely all over the place in a way that made it a bit of a frustrated sigh to fight him."
darksouls3,3e0c78,ninthbelief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the solution would be to make the camera angles a bit more dynamic. Idk if that would be sacrilege to suggest among souls fans, but I think playing with camera angles could make for some interesting boss fights."
darksouls3,3e0c78,PacMoron,12,Tue Jul 21 11:01:04 2015 UTC,"Shadows of Yharnam was one of my favorite fights in any Souls game. In a way the PLAYER CHARACTER was the ""lone super powerful boss"" and it was the three shadows trying to use teamwork to kill you."
darksouls3,3e0c78,AndyLC,5,Tue Jul 21 03:59:25 2015 UTC,My favourite part of the fight is that the Supreme Gank Squad of Yharnam get stronger progressively but the second phase starts before you can kill even one of them. It adds a lot of strategy IMO because you have to decide who you can deal with in the second phase for longer and then focus 100% of the damage on the remaining foe so that you can kill them quickly once the snakes comeout. On my first try Ijust went in and split my damage between the two swordsmen. Learnt fromthat one pretty quick.
darksouls3,3e0c78,TheRecherche,3,Tue Jul 21 10:59:54 2015 UTC,Oh man so true. Just reading that made be giddy.

darksouls3,3e0c78,redtoasti,2,Tue Jul 21 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think it should be done as needed. If lore and progression dictates more multitarget bosses, that's fine -- and if it doesn't, that's fine too. I loved Velstadt and Artorias just as much as I loved Ornstein and Smough or Throne Duo, and I hated Dragonrider as much as I hated Shadows of Yharnam. There are good and bad boss fight designs, and even that is opinionated -- I don't think there's a right or wrong way to do Souls bosses, I'm just happy to take whatever Miyazaki throws at me. Opinions will always differ.  That aside, I think it's a bit of a sham to insult Throne Duo and then praise Ornstein and Smough."

When you summon Benhart and Vengarl it becomes a lot less of a chore boss fight and more like a brawl with your friends, which isn't something you get for many bosses unless you have actual friends"
darksouls3,3e0c78,Arkflame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a minority, just not part of the vocal majority. Throne Duo is an amazing fight, their OST is fantastic and the effort put into that two-enemy boss fight's individual members makes it memorable as hell. Its biggest problems came from being in an environment that they clearly weren't designed for and sharing said environment with a boss that was clearly designed for it. Had there been a few pillars in the room, and a little tuned up difficulty (less time before they resurrect each other and a grab for each of them, maybe?), it would've been the next O&S. Shame that between their environment and their lore they get so much hate, they really are an incredible fight."
darksouls3,3e0c78,ninthbelief,3,Tue Jul 21 10:26:29 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with ""gangbang"" bosses if they are done in an interesting way like Phalanx from Demons Souls."
darksouls3,3e0c78,Kilef,4,Tue Jul 21 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can't just be ""a bunch of dudes"". What's the reason, or trade-off? The Phalanx mobs are vulnerable on their back, so they form a .... phalanx.  4 Kings has more bosses show up over time, turning the encounter into a race.  Shadows of Yharnam are clearly a team, with different movesets to cover each other's weaknesses. The enrage mechanic was brilliant as well.  Rom is wimpy caster, so he needs body guards in place of actual melee attacks, dodging, or blocking.  The extra enemies need a specific reason to exist that provides compelling gameplay. They should make you think, instead of making you annoyed. You can't make a boss and say ""Oh, this is too easy. Just add another one and call it a day."""
darksouls3,3e0c78,Spyger,6,Tue Jul 21 05:59:32 2015 UTC,"""Oh, this is too easy. Just add another one and call it a day""  What bosses can you really say that for? I don't think that really happens, and for good reason. Adding more to a boss that is designed to be fought by itself just never works out. Look at dual Pursuers and Sanctuary Guardians. These fights are complete bullshit because they weren't designed to be fought with clones of themselves. Ruin Sentinels is a balanced fight because they were designed to be fought 2 at a time. I'm sure that the vast majority of bosses in any of these games with multiple enemies are designed with that in mind.  And, I mean, couldn't what you said apply to Rom? You said yourself he's wimpy, and needs adds to make him difficult."
darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,4,Tue Jul 21 06:43:48 2015 UTC,"Dragon riders, giant rat boss, freja, lud and zallen, elana, 3 npc enemies boss. Freja and rom are a perfect example how to make a giant spider boss wrong and annoying vs tense and good"
darksouls3,3e0c78,TenDeadlyVenoms,5,Tue Jul 21 07:02:23 2015 UTC,What exactly differentiates good implementation of multiple enemies from bad implementation? Cause I like Freja and Elana. Rat Authority and the gank are bad bosses but I don't think it's because of the fact that they had multiple enemies. Witch of Hemwick and Pinwheel are bad but it's not because of the fact that they have multiple targets. Correlation does not equal causation.
darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,2,Tue Jul 21 07:23:41 2015 UTC,"So far, we've seen two different formats.   Multiple bosses.   Bad examples of this are ones in which they throw in another boss just ""because"". Dragonriders, Pursuers, and Elana come to mind. There should be some sort of purpose, and ideally, an interaction between the bosses.  Good examples are Ruin Sentinels and 4 Kings. While the encounters consist of multiple identical bosses, it's a clear design decision. Ruin Sentinels coordinate their attacks, and fight at a slow pace because you have to deal with 2 at once. 4 Kings actually aren't intended to be fought simultaneously, so the encounter becomes a race against the clock.  Great examples are O&S or Shadows of Yharnam. Different bosses that interact with each other. Because they are different, and respond to the damage of one another, it provides the player with a sort of puzzle to figure out their own solution for.   Boss + adds.   There are a lot of bad examples of this in Souls games; Rat Authority, Tower Knight, One Reborn, Freja, and probably more I'm not thinking of. Throwing little trash mobs into a boss fight is just annoying, and can really frontload the difficulty. Struggling on the very first part of a boss is the most annoying, because it means you spend a lot of time loading and running compared to actually fighting. Then it feels even more silly once you beat the whole encounter as soon as you get past the first little part with the adds.  Adds should fill a niche in an encounter, something that the boss itself is missing. Rom does this, although I'm still not a big fan of him. Ideally, they should interact with the boss or the arena in some way. Rom technically does this as well, but the better example is actually the Skeleton Lords.  Hopefully they can learn how to do these types of encounters better. There is plenty of inspiration to draw from; MMOs have been doing these for a long time now.  TL;DR: Purpose and interaction."
darksouls3,3e0c78,Spyger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:34 2015 UTC,"I really can't see how you differentiate Rom and Freja based on their ads. To me both of them were wrong and annoying, Rom didn't do anything that actually threatened my attempt, you can dodge everything she does by sprinting in a circle around her at a reasonable distance."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:50 2015 UTC,"Rom don't actively participating in the fight while you are against the spider mobs, only occasional long range attack. Once the spiders gone you deal with Rom until she teleport and spawn new batch of spiders.  It's a fair fight, since average player's stamina and health during that level is enough to deal with the spiders and Rom.  Meanwhile, Freja actively attack you with laser which is almost OHKO, does knocking back swing, and slow you with the spider webs during the entire fight. The spiders also always there, they respawn at consistent rate. The spiders also move insanely quick, and can knock down 1/3 of player's health per hits, and they come in group.   Not the same.  The most extreme example I can find for gangbanging boss is Elana.   That fight is real bullshit - she can teleport, she can deal massive damage from long range, she have also damaging AOE attack in close range, she can cast her spell real quick, she can summon Velstald who is quick on his feet and have highly damaging attack which can plummet you down, to eat more attacks. Her trio skeleton summon also can be annoying with their parrying ability.  I spend my time the entire fight running from Velstald, I don't kill him since Elana can summon another Velstald quickly afterward, while dodging Elana's dark orb and lingering flame. Waiting her to spawn in my running path so I can get a hit or two, before continuing the marathon."
darksouls3,3e0c78,SilverStoneSlide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like them to have a very good selection of bosses, ranging from humanoid to beast to pure monster to a gimmick boss or two if its well designed and just plain cool, but the one thing that's important is that if its parryable, it should make sense, the way BB's parries made sense.  You had a gun, you shot the thing when it was charging or attacking and staggered it for a good hit.  That said, parries shouldn't result in more damage on the bosses."

darksouls3,3e0c78,Lack-of-FPS,0,Tue Jul 21 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"That's because DS2 PVE was shit (Oh no not the downvotes, oh the humanity!) and took the easy route with a bunch of humanoid bosses that had virtually the same move sets as basic enemies. They were absolutely lifeless and just boring to fight but then the DLC came out and Tanimura gave us some of the coolest boss fights in Souls history and they were all humanoid. Bloodborne speaks for itself, Gascoigne, gehrman, logarius, Shadows, etc were all amazing bosses. I believe that with Miura and Tanimura at the helm of DS3 we can get some pretty kickass knightly bosses again."
darksouls3,3e0c78,Gregory_Fontaine,3,Tue Jul 21 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"I believe your characterization of Dark Souls 2 PvE to be, well, incorrect.   https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/39is5a/critiquing_the_critic_the_matthewmatosis_dark/  Then this: https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkSouls2/comments/3cg8iv/critiquing_the_critic_the_matthewmatosis_dark/"
darksouls3,3e0c78,FLRSH,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"No it's 100% accurate. Excluding the DLC, the main game offers pretty pathetic boss fights  visually, mechanically, and lore wise. The Old Dragon Slayer should not have even been in thus game to begin with and his move set and model are just ripped from DS1 so he's also left out. In fact many bosses in this game are built off of previous boss mechanics but done in such an inferior way that it really didn't matter. The Throne Watcher and Throne Defender are DS2 version's of  O&S. However where O&S have complementary move sets (ones fast and has thrusts, the other is slower and has wide sweeps) Throne Watcher and Defender do not. They both just slash at you with the same speed and move set seen on Syan Knights and that's the extent of the boss battle. I believe it was Matthewmatosis himself that mentioned this. Then you look at the ""lore"" behind these two and that's it, there virtually non existent just serving the purpose as a boss fight."

darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,5,Tue Jul 21 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"Oh god I'm glad I'm not the only one.  Logarius is by far one of the most garbage bosses I have ever fought.  Lets have a break down  Resistant to all forms of elemental damage, i.e. Fire, Shock and Arcane. Whats that? You're an Arcane build? Too bad. You want to use consumables and be clever with your resources like every other boss in the game? Too bad.  Spams the same attacks over and over in each phase. You don't like big balls of energy constantly fired at you? Too bad, even if you sit right in front of him he'll either spam the exploding skull or the massive energy attack. Sometimes he'll use a variation of the exploding skull directly on top of himself to make sure you don't stay on top of him and then he'll spam the energy ball attack!  Whats that? You landed a good parry but he hit you? Well Logarius despite being a decrepit skeleton man as indicated by his cutscene is remarkably spry. He'll get up well before you can reach him and land a visceral attack on him. Sucks to be you right? All that health lost.  Want to get clever and try knocking Logarius off the edge of the arena like the Iron Golem? HAH What do you think this is? Some kind of fair game? Fuck no, there are invisible walls around the Arena, Logarius can't fall off. But he CAN get stuck in a corner where he'll spam either the huge energy ball attack or the exploding skull making it near impossible to hit him.  Logarius is a fucking terrible boss."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,3,Tue Jul 21 07:34:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the cutscene with Logarius shows him starting off as decrepit but by the end of the cutscene he is moving fluidly. I think it's meant to showcase how quickly he can awaken from his restive state to ""combat ready."" That's how I've always interpreted it, anyway..."
darksouls3,3e0c78,dargon_lover,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well first off, Logarius can fly so knocking him off the edge is a bad call anyway. Second I think the fight highlights what I think is a key principal in building your character: Variation. An arcane build is great, I love mine. However you can't expect to be able to face every boss on even footing relying on one stat. I built arcane and then put points into skill on the side so that I would never have to worry about my damage output tanking if I run out of QS bullets. I fought Logarius and yeah, not having my items to back me up made it harder but I didn't feel cheated because my contingency plan backed me up. In BB particularly you cannot rely on solely Arcane items to do the job. You need some solid damage output from a good weapon as well.  I get the vibe that you're just a little salty, considering you're complaining about missing viscerals and being unable to cheese/trap Logarius. We all get our asses kicked every once in a while, it's a From Software game, but that doesn't mean the boss is shit.  Furthermore, why do you hate Gerhman? That fight was on point for me, the perfect ending to the game in an awesome arena with some clever mechanics that work really well with the lore."
darksouls3,3e0c78,TheRecherche,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:24:50 2015 UTC,"""lol ur just salty."" Yeah, a boss could NEVER be unfair or just poorly designed. Clearly the fault is with the player, not this flawless game.  ""why do you hate Gerhman?""  I said that, not him.  I hate Gehrman because he's barely any different from all the other shitty spammy humanoid bosses like Logarius and Pthumerian Descendant. All he does is attack really fast. That's it, there's nothing to him. Might as well just parry him because again, he cannot be staggered in his second phase, which is pretty important for bosses that attack and move so quickly. Almost every single attack you do with him will be a trade. And let's not forget his attack which he artificially extends the windup of so he can catch you right after a dodge. He just does a ridiculous amount of damage too. Not to mention, just like Logarius, he has a stupid attack where he flies up into the air, completely breaks lock on, and does a ranged attack. This would be fine if the game's shitty camera didn't cause you to get disoriented.  Literally all there is to this boss's design is ""ATTACK REALLY REALLY FAST AND JUST GO FUCKING CRAZY LOL MIGHT AS WELL JUST PARRY ME CAUSE THAT'S REALLY FUN AND ENGAGING"""
darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Well first off, Logarius can fly so knocking him off the edge is a bad call anyway.   I still don't see why we shouldn't be able to knock him off and have him fly back up or something. It would prevent him from trapping himself in corners and would also give us cause to be careful around the edges. Which would introduce some actual challenge to the fight.   Second I think the fight highlights what I think is a key principal in building your character: Variation.   Not really. A pure physical damage build can get through the game with absolute ease, even the high phys damage resist enemies like the Nightmare beasts will still go down in about the same amount of strikes as regular enemies as they have really low health to account for the high defense.  Variation isn't required whatsoever. Roll pure strength or skill and you'll never run into the same problems an Arcane build will with Logarius. Fuck, you could roll pure Bloodtinge and probably wreck shit pretty easily with Evelyn + Bone dust hitting for over 500 damage on most enemies. You'd have to turn health into QS bullets quite often but its completely doable.   However you can't expect to be able to face every boss on even footing relying on one stat.   Roll a str or skill character and tell me that again.   I built arcane and then put points into skill on the side so that I would never have to worry about my damage output tanking if I run out of QS bullets.   Eh, QS bullets aren't required for an Arcane build. Put a fire/shock/arcane gem into your weapon of choice and all of its physical damage becomes that element. I  cycle between a Fire Ludwigs, Shock Tonitrus and Arcane Cane depending on the situation, and it wasn't until I reached Logarius that I had to revert back to physical damage because of his stupid resistances.   You get quite a bit of versatility with the Arcane stat. If you hit a fire resist enemy you can hit it with shock or arcane. As far as I know, Logarius is the only boss with huge resistance to all three elemental stats and thats ridiculous.   fought Logarius and yeah, not having my items to back me up made it harder   I actually don't rely on items in my fights all that much, I just like having the option. I found that Logarius took everything that made Bloodborne interesting and threw it down the shitter. His fight removed any real strataegy from it.   In BB particularly you cannot rely on solely Arcane items to do the job.    I don't. And if you run an Arcane build neither should you. Look into putting a fire/shock gemstone into Ludwig's holy blade. It has decent Arcane scaling so the elemental damage you get out of it is fantastic.   You need some solid damage output from a good weapon as well.   Once again, I don't rely on hunter tools. In fact I barely use them at all. The only three I use are Executioner's Gloves, Augur of Ebrietas and Beast Roar because they're the only ones with appropriate QS cost for the reward.   I get the vibe that you're just a little salty, considering you're complaining about missing viscerals and being unable to cheese/trap Logarius. We all get our asses kicked every once in a while, it's a From Software game, but that doesn't mean the boss is shit.   Actually no, I killed him on my second try. I took all of my elemental gems out of Ludwig's blade and replaced them to maximize physical damage.   He is just a really shitty boss. I'm complaining about missing viscerals because its more than a little irritating, I got the timing on my second attempt but the first time I was constantly hit as I parried him. He's the first boss I've had get up well before I can reach him for a visceral after receiving a hit, and I never complained about being unable to trap him. In fact quite the opposite, if you trap Logarius he'll typically spam his close range explosive and its very difficult to get him out of that.   I don't want to be able to cheese him either. I'd just like to be able to fight him with the same versatility I have with every other boss instead of being forced into using physical damage. If I wanted to play a Str or Skill build I would've done it.  The boss is shit, he's a terrible boss and he wasn't worth the five minutes it took to kill him. He's bloodbornes equivalent to the Clergy in terms of just being a pointless and stupid waste of time."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:32:57 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but your complaint is that he spams attacks in the first phase(admittedly extremely annoying), that his elemental weaknesses are non-existent(but Raime, Alonne, Elana, Artorias or Kalameet are the same), and that your visceral timing is off?   This all equates to a really shitty boss who threw everything good about BB's bosses down the toilet? I'm seeing a huge lapse in judgment there. Logarius is one of the fastest, most varied bosses in the game, particular in his second phase. He has a fuckton of attacks and makes Flamelurker seem passive. Then there's the OST and the visuals and the lore. He's a fantastic fight, however I just wish he were less of a backpedaling pussy during his first phase."

I'm seeing a huge lapse in judgment there.   Its fine that you don't agree with my assessment of this boss but please don't call it a lapse of judgement.   Logarius is one of the fastest, most varied bosses in the game, particular in his second phase. He has a fuckton of attacks and makes Flamelurker seem passive.   In my experience even in the second phase when he's aggressive his combo starts off with the same arcing swing from his left, followed up with a couple of jabs by his sword.   Occasionally he'll switch it up with that sword aoe crap which can be dealt with almost immediately.  I wouldn't really call that varied. And being fast and aggressive doesn't make a good boss.    Then there's the OST and the visuals and the lore.   These have nothing to do with the fight. Visuals, soundtrack and background lore don't make up for shitty mechanics and design.   that his elemental weaknesses are non-existent(but Raime, Alonne, Elana, Artorias or Kalameet are the same)   Non-existant is a really dishonest way of putting it. They aren't non existant, they are reversed. He has huge elemental resistance, arcane is at 290, fire is at 160 and bolt is at 180.   For reference Darkbeast Paarl has 75 arcane resistance, fire at 85 and bolt at 300.   As for the bosses you brought up, first of all Kalameet is resistant to fire and magic, leaving lightning a viable option. Because he's a dragon.  As for the rest I don't think theres any real excuse, especially Knight Artorias who is resistant to slash, blunt, magic, fire and lightning. Every single damage type except for thrust damage which is just stupid.  The Dark Souls 2 DLC was notorious for cranking up elemental resistances on all mobs and its something that I do actually think is ridiculous. The fact that I haven't mentioned them in my discussion of a Bloodborne boss is not ignoring their issues.  That said, I think every one of those bosses you mentioned has far superior mechanics and design to logarius. The high resistance to all elemental damage is a downside but they make up for it by being genuinely entertaining and interesting fights.  Logarius swings his scythe predictably and spams the same attacks continuously throughout his phases on an arena with invisible walls around it all with cranked up resistances rendering all usable items completely worthless against him.  That is why I think he is a shitty boss who threw everything good about BB's bosses down the shitter. Every other boss has some weakness that you can exploit as well as requiring greater preparation as you may bring various items with you to enhance the fight, Logarius doesn't, he's only staggerable during his first phase and then in his second phase buffs himself so he can no longer be staggered. The ONLY preparation is to bring quicksilver bullets and just parry him, he's essentially Bloodborne's shitty version of Gwyn lord of Cinder."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"He has far more moves than you're giving him credit for. There's about as many mixups between the scythe and the sword as there is for raime's longsword and UGS. The guide in front of me, which lists the movesets for every boss in the game, as well anecdotal evidence would also suggest that he uses FAR more than a single horizontal swipe combo ending in a thrust. If that was your experience with him thanks to RNG(he is known to get stuck in an animation loop, completely independent of the memory leak thing), I could see why you'd think it's a shitty fight.   His speed and aggression(which you're absolutely right, don't make for a great fight on their own), coupled with his moveset, makes me feel extremely panicked when playing, more so than a lot of the other bosses. For me, this is stimulating as all fuck. I'm weaving in and out of his attacks, just praying for an opening long enough to squeeze in a transform attack. and having done a no-gun run, I can verify he is perfectly manageable(and much more fun imho) without parries. I've also never had an issue with the invisible walls because I generally don't let him get over there, but evidently we have pretty different impressions of the boss and this discussion can just serve as a monument to the subjectivity of fun i guess"
darksouls3,3e0c78,Scrubstadt,0,Wed Jul 22 00:20:26 2015 UTC,"""He's fast (like every boss in Bloodborne) and has lots of attacks (no he doesn't) so that means he's good""  lol"
darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,0,Tue Jul 21 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"Then what's your criteria for a good fight? Thus far you've only really complained about minor issues and have been decrying the whole fight based on them.  Speed makes the fights more dynamic, pretty sure this is why BB was developed with speed in mind. After all, I'm slapping inputs on a controller. Increasing the number of inputs required naturally is more stimulating. Not sure that's even an arguable point.   He has a shitload of attacks, more than any Souls boss save maybe Allant, Artorias, Manus and Alonne. You saying he doesn't, doesn't somehow preclude the truth. So I'm not sure what your precedent is that Logarius somehow evaded. I'd love to hear what bosses you think are more tightly designed.  Your arguments for why he's a shit boss aren't convincing. You've made the same point I did about his magic phase being repetitive but beyond that have only really made arguments highlighting the errors in your approach to the fight. He recovers too fast? Stay closer to him.  He backs up into the corners? Manage your movement in such a way that he goes where you want him to. It's pretty easy, it's basically what governs your success during O&S. He has no elemental weaknesses? I don't have the guide onhand but I recall downing him faster with Tonitrus than any other weapon in the game. Could just be me though, but as I said before a lot of the bosses people gush over in this series have ridiculous elemental defenses, namely DLC bosses that From didn't want mages to cheese like Manus, Artorias, Raime or Ivory King. They're fantastic bosses besides that though."
darksouls3,3e0c78,Scrubstadt,0,Tue Jul 21 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yoy are yet to explain the Gerhman fight but whatever, you're clearly focused on shitting on an optional boss.   I'd just like to fight him with the same versatility I have with every other boss   Well you can't push other bosses off of cliffs so I'm not sure what you want. My entire point is that guaranteed versatility isn't something you should expect. The Rom fight is a piece of piss with arcane. Fire damage wrecks him and using pure physical means you get a lot less damage in when you go through the gauntlet of spiders between attacks. A physical damage build is more versatile but by no means infallable.   Variation isn't required whatsoever   Well if you get the minimum skill etc to use Kirkhammer then max strength you'll probably find yourself running into problems. The blunt force damage of the hammer is good but it's speed lets you down in a lot of fights as well as showing a noticeable decrease in damage against blunt resistant enemies. So you switch to sword mode to make up the difference. So now you have a quicker weapon that can only stun off of its R2 eats your stamina up with less damage than another weapon of similar speed. So now your pure strength build is starting to show some holes. So let's look at pure skill. You get the Blades of Mercy and max skill. You get solid combos and speed plus a stun lock off of R1s when transformed. But you have no range so fights like Gerhman are harder because you're so outranged and Paarl is harder because you can't just hit his belly like with Ludwigs. There are combat downsides to pure strength/skill but damage ones to pure arcane. Variation can nulify all of these so that they aren't issues. Bloodtinge is a little broken IMO because if you farm for the lost Chikage and tank gems then your damage output is just insane so a pure bt build has a few less downsides.  As for using items it's a matter of preference but when Logarius uses his storm of swords attack (one of the best parts of the fight that I love) I found my arcane items useful. Tiny Tonitrus did fuck all damage to him but game me a small stagger after he dropped the sword so that I could rush him to break the sword and combo him quickly before backing out. Complaining about his explosive skull is just complaining about getting hit. Of course he's going to smack yoy back. The point is that you aren't allowed to get greedy with your combos for fear of getting slammed. It keeps you on your toes, just like a good boss should. I got killed by Logarius a few times before I learnt the fight. There's no shame in it, he gave plenty of people trouble. He's hard but not shit. IMO there is nothing wrong with an optional fight that kicks you in the teeth for bringing the wrong toys to the party because if you refuse to learn from the experience then you can skip him or you can just figure out what he's weak against and use it against him, just like with any enemy in the game.   he wasn't worth the five minutes it took to kill him.   Fighting Logarius, dying, changing gems, running through Cainhurst and fighting him again takes longer than five minutes. Furthermore you unlock the Evelyn, Chikage, Vileblood rune, Cainhurst set and the next phase of Alfred's quest which lets you get the Executioner's rune and Gold Ardeo helmet. All of these are pretty good rewards for a boss you killed on your second attempt.  You said that you disliked how athletic he was for a skeleton. What kind of argument is this? He is clearly using all kinds of blood magic to aid him and he is a hunter. Gerhman (among others) is essentially able to blink and he has one foot."
darksouls3,3e0c78,TheRecherche,3,Tue Jul 21 12:28:57 2015 UTC,"you're clearly focused on shitting on an optional boss.   The entire game is optional. If it was put in the game, it deserved to be criticized."
darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yoy are yet to explain the Gerhman fight but whatever, you're clearly focused on shitting on an optional boss.   Gehrman is optional too. Honestly I don't have much to say about his fight, Logarius is one of the only bosses I think this poorly of.   Well you can't push other bosses off of cliffs so I'm not sure what you want.   What I want is no obvious invisible walls. Honestly all it would've taken is putting a railing there, but they didn't do that, they have a sheer drop which you magically can't fall off of.   My entire point is that guaranteed versatility isn't something you should expect. The Rom fight is a piece of piss with arcane. Fire damage wrecks him and using pure physical means you get a lot less damage in when you go through the gauntlet of spiders between attacks. A physical damage build is more versatile but by no means infallable.    You can decimate Rom with pure physical. There is not a single boss in the game where the damage is reduced to the same extent if you're using physical over arcane.    Well if you get the minimum skill etc to use Kirkhammer then max strength you'll probably find yourself running into problems. So now you have a quicker weapon that can only stun off of its R2 eats your stamina up with less damage than another weapon of similar speed. So now your pure strength build is starting to show some holes.    Holes, please, this is more akin to pinpricks. You could easily switch to any other number of strength weapons which have faster movesets and still do huge damage. Arcane builds rely on elemental damage and has three damage types to choose from, this is usually enough versatility however then Logarius comes along and shits all over that concept.  My point still stands, regardless of the flaws you can roll pure strength or pure skill and never run into this same issue.   You get the Blades of Mercy and max skill. You get solid combos and speed plus a stun lock off of R1s when transformed. But you have no range so fights like Gerhman are harder because you're so outranged and Paarl is harder because you can't just hit his belly like with Ludwigs. There are combat downsides to pure strength/skill but damage ones to pure arcane.   No, these exact same downsides apply to arcane because you should never be relying on hunter tools and you have to use the exact same weapons as someone using a str and skill build. The only difference is in your damage type, the movesets are identical.  You are not pointing out unique downsides to a skill or strength build, you're pointing out downsides in very specific weapons that an arcane build will probably end up using anyway.   Variation can nulify all of these so that they aren't issues.   How. The weapon movesets don't suddenly change if you put equal points strength and skill. I agree, vary your weapons and you wont have issues with a STR or Skill build, an arcane build boosts your elemental damage, you have very little boosts to raw physical damage. You cant simply switch weapons for an Arcane build and I shouldn't be forced into going into a Hybrid due  to poor design decisions.   Tiny Tonitrus did fuck all damage to him but game me a small stagger after he dropped the sword so that I could rush him to break the sword and combo him quickly before backing out.   Couldn't you achieve the same with a firearm? I know I used the pistol to do the exact same thing and it uses less QS bullets.   Complaining about his explosive skull is just complaining about getting hit.   Don't twist my words, my complaints are to the frequency of which he uses it. I watched in awe as he spammed it about 6 times in a row despite the fact that I wasn't even in range of it. It was amazing, really hammered in how shitty of a boss he was.   The point is that you aren't allowed to get greedy with your combos for fear of getting slammed. It keeps you on your toes, just like a good boss should.    Oh please. He spams the same attacks in phase 1 over and over to the point where I was barely even sprinting to get away from them, let alone dashing.   Then he enters phase 2 and you can literally just parry every single one of his swings due to how predictable they are.   He's hard but not shit.   I  disagree, he's shit but not hard.   I feel like you're reading my posts and assuming I had trouble with this boss. I didn't. There is no shame in dying to him because most bosses of the souls series tend to be challenging to most players, that doesn't mean that they can't be shit.    IMO there is nothing wrong with an optional fight that kicks you in the teeth for bringing the wrong toys to the party because if you refuse to learn from the experience then you can skip him or you can just figure out what he's weak against and use it against him, just like with any enemy in the game.   Yeah I dunno personally I prefer my games to let you get by on skill instead of making sure you picked the right build at the start of the game.    Fighting Logarius, dying, changing gems, running through Cainhurst and fighting him again takes longer than five minutes.    Oh come on. The second fight took 5 minutes total, thats what I meant.   Furthermore you unlock the Evelyn, Chikage, Vileblood rune, Cainhurst set and the next phase of Alfred's quest which lets you get the Executioner's rune and Gold Ardeo helmet. All of these are pretty good rewards for a boss you killed on your second attempt.   I don't see what the rewards have to do with it. I could have received a gold plated toilet seat that turned my character into a living god, it wouldn't have made Logarius any less of a terribly designed boss.   You said that you disliked how athletic he was for a skeleton. What kind of argument is this? He is clearly using all kinds of blood magic to aid him and he is a hunter.   I'm guessing you skipped the introduction cinematic where Logarius struggles to get out of his chair and walk unaided then?  And the cutscene that  shows Gehrman casually get up and get ready to beat the shit out of you?  He was introduced as this pathetic decrepit old creature that was practically frozen stiff. My dislike was that he gets up from a parry faster than most other enemies."
darksouls3,3e0c78,skabbo,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"Fucking thank you. Other shit things about him is that he's unstaggerable in his second phase which makes using a slow weapon completely useless because you'll barely be allowed to get one hit in. Also, while he's powering up into his second phase, backstabbing him will stop the animation and everything, but he's still gets powered up regardless. Fucking lame."

You can literally trap that boss in a corner by R1 spamming and she won't do jack fucking shit. Not to mention she just spams the same couple attacks over and over. That boss is so shit that it can't even be considered a joke boss. My god, I thought I saw the extent of Bloodborne fanboyism, but this is just absurd.  ""Then again, people overhype him and Raime even more grossly than their HP pools are inflated.""  Complaining about inflated HP pools in DkS2 while praising Bloodborne. Oh the delicious irony.  ""Objectively compare the number of moves and the types of movement required""  The number of moves does not matter. The types of movement? Every boss in Bloodborne involves nothing other than simple dodging.  ""shitty chalice fights like Beast-Possessed Soul or Brainsuckers to that of Lost Sinner or Velstadt.

darksouls3,3e0c78,LSDawson,-7,Tue Jul 21 18:54:27 2015 UTC,Lol yeah people do over hype those two but even Artorias isn't all that in a bag of chips. Still they do stand out from DS2 as being really fun an mildly challenging bosses that have interesting lore to boot.
darksouls3,3e0c78,Gregory_Fontaine,-6,Tue Jul 21 07:45:33 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.   I was fucking ecstatic when CotOIK came out and Alonne and Raime were both fantastic in addition to the great level design. I'm a big fan of Sinh and Ivory King as well, but I think even Raime is significantly weaker than most of the fights in BB. The first phase is largely circling his left and dodging the slow, telegraphed swing at the end of certain combos and the second phase as admittedly pretty dynamic but every hit does 60% of your health to compensate for being relatively predictable(except that AoE holy shit). I love the fight. I love almost all of the bosses in the series for their own reasons, even Dragon God and Bed of Chaos.  I think despite all the great shit that's present in DaS2, BB's a step above. At least with respect to the bosses."

And all but a few of the difficult ones are complete bullshit.

Those two worked together about as well as a blind man with a rabid seeing eye dog.   Ornstein would always dash well and truly far ahead of you. He was easy to isolate and murder because Smough took time to waddle over and telegraphed his attacks like mad. I didn't feel as though they complemented each other at all. It would have made sense to have two knights like Ornstein, one with maybe a sword and shield and the other with a spear. The shield one trying to get between you and the spear user in order to protect him.  As it was, you often saw Smough flatten Ornstein yet do no damage. Which is something that always irritated me.  I guess my only other complaint is the extendo arms of the Shadows of Yarnham, but like most boss fights, that one was made trivial by the speed of healing items and the pitiful stamina cost of dashing and rolling."

darksouls3,3dzoyk,survivor4321,18,Tue Jul 21 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"Definately sounds cool, but mechanically it creates inconsistency.  Rolls have to be consistent and should be the same for everyone cause it's a VERY important move that grants a player total invincibility while within its iframes. Stuff like changing it to an even more powerful move at low equiploads or Flip rings break that balance even more."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Perenthis_,9,Mon Jul 20 21:36:59 2015 UTC,"We already have light roll, med roll, and fat roll.  What's wrong with adding an extra roll speed?"
darksouls3,3dzoyk,falconfetus8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"In the case of dwgr, it was just kinda broken. Flip backstabs plus you weren't about to hit a flipper with a slow weapon, just too many iframes. It could probably be ok with an extremely low equip percent."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Jgwman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:54:03 2015 UTC,"It will just make all other roll speeds over it irrevant.   In DkS1 there was no reason NOT to flip if you had low enough weight and could afford to wear the flip ring, but at LEAST it was a ring (however bad) so it meant not everyone had to go there. When you integrate that as a roll speed, everyone will be forced to go there to be competitively viable cause dodging is almost everything in these games. DkS1 fast roll was strong enough, there is no need for even more powerful dodging.  As an extra bit of info, the extra iframes of even the flip ring caused a helluva lot of problems with shit like coming out of a roll animation while iframes are still active, being able to parry with iframes on, etc etc. If you make an entire new animation like in BB for example for realy light characters, only god knows the implications it could have, if it allows for much more mobility it would become essential.  EDIT: Also since the OPs wish is to implement BB dashes as an extra roll speed and according to the live demo instant backstabs are back, just imagine what the game would turn into. You'd just have dashing idiots circling you in an instant for backstabs. There is a reason only BB has these dashes, cause it doesn't have backstabs you can abuse with them."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Perenthis_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"Why not have it replace the fast roll, then?"
darksouls3,3dzoyk,falconfetus8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:15 2015 UTC,For the reason I mentioned on my edit. Dashes in a Dark Souls game with backstabs in it would just cause problems cause they make getting behind someone very easy.
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Perenthis_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:50 2015 UTC,What if it had the same speed and i-frames as a fast roll?
darksouls3,3dzoyk,falconfetus8,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"That is incredibly vauge.  It all depents on how the animation works, how do you dash around someone, what's the recovery on it, what direction it allows you to face in its recovery.  For example a roll goes one way and you will be facing that way at its end. That's important, as it allows punishment of bad rolls and panic rolls as it exposes your back.  If the dashing has you looking at the enemy at all times, you never expose your back with bad dashes and you are ALWAYS at the ready for an offensive, also a dashing animation would inevitably have less recovery and weird effects cause dodging iframes are tied to animations and their length.  Over all, it's not worth changing as rolls already work for this game and it's not Bloodborne. Balancing a roll speed, distance and recovery is already hard enough, balancing an entirely new animation on top of all that is almost impossible."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Perenthis_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"What I'm suggesting is that the overall behavior of the roll remain identical.  Just instead of it looking like a roll, it'd look like a dash.  A purely aesthetic change."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,falconfetus8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Imo it would end up looking weird if you tried tying a dash to the exact same mechanics as a roll, your character would end up dashing forwards for example and just stare in nothing as your enemy circles you or something, like.. you don't dash the same way you roll, when you dash, you do it while keeping your foe within your front if you don't do that, why dash forward past them?.."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,Perenthis_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"This how dark souls 1 and confirmed dark souls 3 and BB dash works... You keep facing you enemy when your roll/dash lock on, only dark souls 2 did that"
darksouls3,3dzoyk,aiden041,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"Poise and defense is the balancing point. Dashing/flipping lets you totally avoid an attack at the cost of stamina/timing while high poise lets you take and trade blows.  One of the bad points of DS1 for me was how everyone optimized to be flipping in shirtless havels, I'd want the game to have a balancing point where a poise monster (who doesn't need to even use his fatroll) is viable vs dashing ninjas."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,AndyLC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:58 2015 UTC,"The whole concept of poise is broken. You are comparing Stat stacking (Poise) to something that is still easy to do (roll/dodge) yet at least requires you to not mess up with the timing and direction and keeping track of your stamina.  These two should NEVER be equal. In fact I'd argue poise should be scrapped and replaced by a true hyper armor system for the big weapons that need it instead of the pointless stat stacking that poise is, as long as it's there, someone with a fast weapon can abuse it just as much as the guy with the big weapon (that might actually need the damn thing) which completely breaks its balance.  It's a bad system, they should focus on making bigger weapons viable through hyper armor on swings and more useful and slightly faster movesets instead of stupid stats."

darksouls3,3dzoyk,GuBrynS,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Considering what a big deal poise is in DS1 I'm for it. The moment a greatsword connects with you is the moment you're stunlocked to death, so dash dash dash.   A HIGHER STAMINA COST than Bloodborne's is needed though, you didn't even need to max out your stamina meter to get through that game."
darksouls3,3dzoyk,AndyLC,2,Tue Jul 21 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"BB dash feels like the character is way too nimble, like a weightless being, witch works in BB, but to keep the theme of Dark Souls you need more weight to the movements.

darksouls3,3dzoyk,TenDeadlyVenoms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe some kind of dash dodge would be viable taking the place of the flip. It needs to have very tight weight reqs so you don't run into poise monsters With the best dodge in the game, and should ahave higher STAM reqs than BB's of course. Tbh I'd rather they outright replace the roll with the dash for aesthetic purposes (have it function exactly like the roll, just the dash animation). I just think the dash looks better and more likely in combat then rolling around in 300 lb armor."

It IS not a fast side-step, he litteraly lower his body and do a few step sprint then GO up.

darksouls3,3dzoyk,skabbo,0,Tue Jul 21 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the dash, for a purely visual reason. Both dashes and rolls have iframes associated to them. The fact that you roll through an attack means that visually the area you expose to the attack is smaller, so more often than not it seem like you're actually dodging an attack. With the dash it really seems more often that you're going through an attack. I understand it's technically the same, but it feels less immersive to just go through sword swings like they're not there."

darksouls3,3dxasj,WanderingSpaceHopper,7,Mon Jul 20 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"With a keyboard you're stuck with 8 degrees of movement and moving quickly and slowly is essentially a toggle. Movement is huge in Souls.   The only advantage KB+M gives you is your entire arm for aiming. This makes sense for FPS and other first person games where the emphasis is on looking rather than third person games where the emphasis is on moving.   If that's your preference then that's fine, but it is objectively inferior in this case."
darksouls3,3dxasj,Jabnin,6,Mon Jul 20 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"It is not objectively inferior. The camera control is absolute shit with a controller, especially in combat when your thumb is on the dodge button most of the time.  You also can't perfom certain key combinations which you can perform with KB&M, such as sprinting with your shield up while switching weapons/spells/items and controlling camera all at the same time. If I tried doing that with a controller, either my hand would cramp up within minutes or I just couldn't do it at all.  There has literally never been a time in Souls games where I thought ""damn, if only I had more directions to move in besides these 8."" There have, however, been plenty of times (pretty much throughout every single game) where I appreciated complete control over the camera at all times.  There is also the fact that you can control direction movement by adjusting the camera.the only time you can't do this is when locked on.  Yes, there are advantages of controller, but KB&M also have it's advantages, and there is absolutely no way controller is objectively better."

This way you could not only buy them at a NPC, but also get them as drops or as a reward for cooping or something. This would be important  because many players would not be willing to sacrifice souls for that, but by earning some of those bounty tokens for free(and they wouldn't have any other use), they wouldn't have many reasons to not put a reward.

If player invaders against the ""host"" are too powerful NPC ""shades"" could be used instead but I like the idea of the three players interactions of the ""Attendant"" spreading both hope for the recently fallen ""shade"" and despair to the ""host""  Oh and if a shade kills a host a special ""tear pool"" (like bloodpools but blue) should appear so the attendant can see his minions butcher the host."

darksouls3,3dw4e7,TingTangWallaWallah,4,Mon Jul 20 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"A fashion covenant that gives you a variety of exquisite hats and masks. I'm thinking of a hat that will spontaneously change colors, or a top hat that is several meters tall. Leaving the covenant would cause all of the covenant items to vanish until rejoined.   Ranking up in the covenant involves collecting Scraps of Cloth, which you get by ""breaking down"" certain unique armor pieces located throughout the world. Some of these pieces might include an iconic hat from an NPC, whom you must kill in order to pursue your quest for fashion. Or it could be as simple as finding some fancy pants off of a dead body. These unique armors will still look good by themselves, but you will have to make the choice to sacrifice or keep them.   Finding and breaking down all of the unique armor pieces in one playthrough will give you just enough Scraps of Cloth to reach the max rank of the covenant, granting you access to the mother lode of Fashion Souls."

The catch is, if you kill them, they also become monstrous, and the only way for them to cure it is by invading someone else and killing them.  The effects of being monstrous might be something like:  - some NPCs are scared of you and won't interact normally  - increased damage versus invasion victims  - A unique attack kind of like the dragon covenant stuff from DS1  - Infinite free invasions until you cure it.    To keep it from becoming too obnoxious, I might limit it so the effects of the covenant only happen in a certain useful but not necessary area, like a shortcut or a secondary blacksmith or something."

""Instead of a havel's ring you get a royal soldier's ring"" Good. Havel's made too large of an impact on your character.  ""the fylnn's ring has too convoluted a mechanic"" Eh...no? Just low equip load. Pretty simple. I used it on many builds.  ""If Dark Souls 1 had 3 or 4 ring slots everyone would have been donning a FAP ring, an animal ring and any other ring they can get their hands on."" Well, only if that's the way that the rings were balanced. Obviously giving you 4 ring slots in DS1 would be absurd, but Dark Souls 3 won't have rings as powerful as those in DS1 to compensate for the extra slots."

Better a big equip load boosting ring to save me from wasting points on my endurance rather than a measly 10% ring that also weighs."

darksouls3,3dv62i,AndyLC,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:23 2015 UTC,Dark Souls 1 rings with 4 available slots would end in fap+havels+darkwood+wolf for me. Oh God that would be so broken. I have a character that's fast rolling with havels and a wolf rig and I have 84 poise. I think the ninjas flip on top of that would seal the deal on most effective build I have ever made. I hope DS3 has 2 normal rings like dark souls 1 but an extra slot for covenant rings or special rings that include covenants and things like the Orange charred ring.
darksouls3,3dv62i,hsapin,2,Mon Jul 20 07:50:26 2015 UTC,"2 ring slots, no durability, but preferably no effects like hornet and dwgr. I'm not saying either is overpowered,  (tothis day I still play DS1 and use both) but I'd love the ring to be a bit less defining. Significantly extra iframes is silly, and so is 30% more crit damage. Ring would be cool if they we toned down to the style they were in Demons'."
darksouls3,3dv62i,redtoasti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:57 2015 UTC,Having your equipment made from paper mache in general is annoying as fuck. I don't know who thought of that durability bullshit but it was probably the same guy who made your health decrease with every death.
darksouls3,3dv62i,Eden108,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:43 2015 UTC,Three would be OK but I'd be just as happy with two or four. I'm sure they would balance accordingly anyway.  All I need is havel and dark wood grain.  Bkflips 4 Eva.
darksouls3,3dv62i,redtoasti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"Why would you only use 2 of your fingers? You have 8 fingers and 2 thumbs to make use of.   Actually, how do people wear rings and gauntlets. They wouldn't fit over most of the clunkier gauntlets, and wearing them underneath would cause them to dig into your fingers.  Replace rings with pendants, is my solution."
darksouls3,3dv62i,Eden108,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno.  I've always thought it's a little strange that someone with 8 fingers can only wear 2 or 4 rings.    I'd want 8 ring slots, but a change in ring gameplay:   Ring functionality is powered by souls; the more powerful function, the more souls it consumes.  When a ring consumes all of its souls, you have to re-imbue it with more for the effect to continue.   So, rings with minor effects like the slow, slow health regen might only require a thousand souls and take hours to use those souls, but a gold covetous ring +3 would require 10k souls and burn through them in 30 minutes.  So, a player could have 8 effects at once, but they would all use souls as various buff timers.  I would add another use for souls, thus increasing the pain at losing them from dying, plus allow for a lot more crazy shit."

darksouls3,3dym4w,Torbid,4,Mon Jul 20 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"Of course, the typical use for this would be a large purchase, so that you wouldn't lose all of your souls on the way to the store.  But what if you used it for small stuff? Every 1000 souls you collect, you get a firebomb. Stuck in a dangerous area far from home? Use this talisman and pop some souls to get a homeward bone.  Cool idea. OP as hell, though. Fortune favors the prepared, unless you put this thing in."
darksouls3,3dym4w,Spyger,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"That would be insanely OP as you wouldn't need to monitor the use of any of your consumables, just go through the area healing whenever and use the souls to always replenish your healing wares and such right before a boss. Or every time you encounter something challenging you would just homeward bone out of there."
darksouls3,3dym4w,Gregory_Fontaine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"This would be OP unless Miyazaki actually implements DkS2 spawning rules where the spawning of enemies stops once it reaches a certain number of times the room was cleared.

darksouls3,3dvsvr,Gregory_Fontaine,18,Sun Jul 19 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem I had with crystal lizards in dark soul 2, besides the need for a vertical attack or jumping attack necessary for some weapons, is that even staggering them would not cancel their teleport. At least in demon's souls they would fall to the ground, and you could still keep hitting them once they got invisible for a couple of seconds."
darksouls3,3dvsvr,linusalmroth,8,Sun Jul 19 23:18:59 2015 UTC,"Also, there were some lizards in DaS2 that had a habit dying in impossible to reach areas when you killed them meaning that you lost their loot forever. I don't know how Demon's Souls or BB did it but I know that in DaS1 their loot was automatically added to your inventory so that that wasn't an issue."
darksouls3,3dvsvr,slayer4513,5,Mon Jul 20 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"In bloodborne they don't despawn the lizard unless you actually pick up the loot.  So if something kills you before you can grab it, or it ragdolls itself off a cliff, you'll get another chance at it.  It saved a lot of otherwise frustrating moments, and let them play around more with putting lizards in challenging spots without having to just give the loot away.  I hope they reuse the mechanic."

darksouls3,3dvsvr,linusalmroth,5,Sun Jul 19 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, hopefully they'll be less frustrating in Dark Souls III. They're a fun mechanic when they work properly though, since they can really lure you into some dangerous situations unless you're cautious."
darksouls3,3dvsvr,MisterKaos,5,Sun Jul 19 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"The thing with bloodborne is not about the creature itself, it's the fact that you can vertically adjust your attacks as much as you like."

darksouls3,3dvsvr,TheOnionBro,3,Sun Jul 19 23:18:30 2015 UTC,In DS2 I typically had to carry around a crystal lizard sword. Those things pissed me off so bad. They weren't so bad in DS1 tho.
darksouls3,3dvsvr,radbong69,3,Mon Jul 20 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the crystal lizards, and god damn were they cute. I almost felt bad for murdering them.  I do agree that you should be able to hit them a little easier, but every single weapon has a jump attack, and thus, can hit the lizards, so every weapon COULD hit and kill them.   What wasn't cool is that you can't cancel the teleport."

darksouls3,3dvsvr,GREBENOTS,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:06 2015 UTC,Be glad you didn't have to deal with Demons Souls crystal lizards. They had a limited spawn count (which went down even if you didn't kill them) AND some were required to complete a few weapon upgrade paths.
darksouls3,3dvsvr,Kilef,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"You know,  the lizard count going down even for a missed attempt seems pretty ""Dark Souls"" to me."

What I'm trying to say, it's that there are many methods to hit them, like vertical attacks, jumping attacks, unlocked attacks, pyromancies, miracles, sorceries. There's no serious reasons to remove those enemies(?) from the game."
darksouls3,3dvsvr,dks3hypeoverload,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:39:25 2015 UTC,It is but there's already too much suspension of belief going on in these games to justify such a specific hitbox on these enemies IMO
darksouls3,3dvsvr,Shroom_Soul,3,Mon Jul 20 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne's Wandering Madness creatures were also attackable as they were fading, and if you hit them they'd start moving around again and stop fading for a couple seconds. I liked this because it means you have to be careful about the enemies around you but still have an opportunity for their loot (which was scarce enough in Bloodborne, for Chunks anyway and especially Rocks)."
darksouls3,3dvsvr,MisterKaos,3,Mon Jul 20 12:14:24 2015 UTC,"I personally disagree, although I'd prefer a style identical to DeS.  I loved the dynamic of choosing to chase down a lizard in DeS, and the feeling of finding their nest in 2-2 was superb, along with the challenging fun of taking the entire nest out without spooking everything inside.  In fact, I'd say that the main thing wrong with lizards in the other games is that there isn't a logical place in the world where a lizard nest would exist."

DS1: Just give them another 1 to 3 months on Lost Izalith and that game's perfect.  DS2: Jesus where to even start? I guess Soul Memory, because it's the biggest affront to what I think Souls should be about, and because so many of the other problems are so entwined with the core gameplay that fixing them wouldn't be as simple as ""add this, take this out,"" and I don't think ""just make the game better"" is a fair request.  BB: Take all the time spent working on the Chalice system and put it into anything else. If DS1 or 2 had Chalices, then fine. They have more than enough hand crafted content. BB didn't.

GRS/RS got about the same treatment, plus the Abyss ring used to be +20% hex damage and it was changed to +7.5%. I think there were other item changes too.  In the first month or so, you could play a pure spellcaster and it was wonderful. You could use nothing but spells to kill everything, including the trashiest of trash mobs, instead of the current low number of low damage casts you need to save for big mobs. You could two or three shot bosses with the right gear and items. It was so incredibly fun, and people cried like little babies that people were playing the game ""wrong"". It was pitifully easy to counter in PvP and it didn't trivialize anything in PvE more than some of the super-OP melee weapons did, but because it was ranged the community threw a shitfit. The B-team clearly agreed and the no fun train started. It's clear they only want spells to be supplementary damage and not your primary playstyle - it's katanas or GTFO. The high damage and casts at launch was aimed at giving people who didn't optimize for spells a valid secondary option and they obviously didn't think anyone would be so crass as to actually try to be a pure caster in a Souls game.  Here's an early speedrun that has the un-nerfed hexes in it (also has bino-boost which is another awesome thing they shouldn't have removed): http://www.twitch.tv/elajjaz/c/4311407 Check Dragonriders, GRS does about 800 damage per cast."

Maybe a choice of where to re-spawn if a boss was what killed you?  At the fog gate or at the last bonfire you rested at?  My biggest gripe with the Souls franchise is the run to the fog gate avoiding enemies or having to defeat the same enemies over and over again while on a long run to a fog gate(I'm looking at you DaS1 DLC and the run to Artorias).  DaS2 tried to help by making enemies stop re-spawning after a while, but that makes it tough to farm without ascetic-ing everything and making the area tougher than I want it to be."

Sure, they mostly look varied and interesting, but many of them are static, uninteresting fights. Deepen their AI, move sets, and attack types.  I'd tell the devs to go back and redo DS1 after Anor Londo, as I do not enjoy most of the bosses and areas in their current form after that point in the game, they feel like a big let down.  I'd have DS2 scrap a bunch of areas that are currently in the vanilla game, expand other areas, create greater continuity with area transitions, and have them twist back on themselves and other areas to a greater degree.  Bloodborne. Either expand the stories/quests of the NPCs, make them more likable and/or more interesting with better voice actors, and/or give us more of them. People don't talk enough about how big of a problem NPCs are in BB, too few of them, too little to do with them, and not nearly a pleasure enough to chat with."

darksouls3,3dyzbl,secretogumiberyjuice,9,Mon Jul 20 19:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yes I have. I've played all of the games' pvp from demon's to blood. Bloodborne is incredibly fast, obviously the fastest. But I think demon's or dark souls 1 have the fastest pvp since, not only is the movement very quick and you have to make split second decisions. Since Bloodborne is somewhat of a spam fest in comparison (no offense to the game it's my 2nd favorite in the series), with DeS/DaS you have to also time things just right so you don't mess up somehow. There's no way you can ever spam if the person you're fighting is skilled at pvp. Although I will grant the falchion from darksouls 1 is bad spam"
darksouls3,3dyzbl,Hooksword95,3,Mon Jul 20 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"I admit I went back to dark souls 1 after 2 and I felt rusty as hell. I think the most off putting thing for me was the I-frames during rolls because unlike in 2 were I-frames had a more forgiving feel, in dark souls 1 the I-frames feel very short and require you to be almost precise on when you time your roll.

I'm used to having the instant sprint, animation cancels, and backsteps of DS2 so that I can keep constant pressure on my enemy. In DkS, it feels like you can only do 1 R1 then flip to safety, or try to get behind your opponent and BS.  I forgot how much of a thing poise was. I also felt restricted with the 4 directional movement. Oddly, when I first played DS2 it felt slow, but now that I know how the engine works, DkS seems like the slow, clunky engine."
darksouls3,3dyzbl,Meto1183,4,Mon Jul 20 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way having just started dks for the first time recently.

(Though tbf I'm not that far in)  Also, I can't use any weapons besides daggers/spears/small swords.

darksouls3,3dyzbl,gwaybz,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"I think you'll get a lot of flak for saying something like that  Fast rolls (and even moreso ninja flips) from DS1 have more i-frames  than fast rolls in DS2 until you reach high agility. You need something close to 115-120 to equal a dark wood grain ring flip, and something like 105 for a regular fast roll.  That means you need to be somewhat high level (and/or invest a lot in ADP) for the rolls to actually be more forgiving than those of DS1, and even then, by a small margin.  I just started playing DS2 again (trying out SotFS) after BB and holy shit am I failing rolls..I get hit so often, I'll really have to git gud again"
darksouls3,3dyzbl,teajellol,3,Mon Jul 20 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"This is right.   I'm posting this because for some reason someone down-voted your comment.  AGI - iFrames (DS2)  85 - 8  90 - 9  95 - 10  100 - 12  105 - 13  110 - 13  115 - 15  120 - 16  DS1:  Slow Roll - 9  Medium Roll - 11  Fast Roll - 13  DWGR - 15  You need somewhere between 95-100 AGL to match a medium roll and 105 AGL to match a fast roll, which means a 32 point investment in ADP.  You need 22~ ADP to match the medium roll in DS1. So the guy you're replying to makes very no sense in all honesty.  Disclaimer: I was not the one that compiled this info. You can find the original post here.  The numbers for ADP do not take into account attunement which also ups AGL. Each spell slot (~4 ATN) = 1 ADP."

darksouls3,3dyzbl,Wubmeister,0,Mon Jul 20 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"They are worse-but-not-worse. They are faster and travel more distance, since that is based on your equip load, so you don't spend more time trying to get back up than rolling, so they're better in that sense, even if there's less iframes during the base agi roll."
darksouls3,3dyzbl,gwaybz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah thats right, I was only thinking of i-frames when I said that.

Too many people shun mages and think magic should pretty much be made redundant because they enjoy using their swords and shields too much and believe that's a good enough reason why they need to get rid of magic, justifying it from one death and crying out ""magic op"" just because they weren't good enough to dodge the spell and kill the mage, which is a stupidly selfish approach to it. I get more angry against the damn phantom range on melee weapons sometimes... but do I constantly bitch about melee wepaons as a whole and believe they should be nerfed into hell? No, I just get on with it and continue using what I enjoy in all rpg's, which is magic. So if you enjoy melee weapons like how I enjoy magic, then that's all fine. Let's just get on with it and all play with what we enjoy the most."
darksouls3,3dwzsv,OccultVanguard,2,Mon Jul 20 11:14:41 2015 UTC,"Upvoted. I like all builds except dex, I could never get into them. I always love playing a faith/str character and I use both spells and melee combat almost equally. I have a sinking feeling that magic might be neutered in 3 after all of the nerfing that magic went through in 2. It's obvious magic trivialized Dark 2, but it should. Magic's more like the easy mode in Souls games and melee is more effective, but for more experienced players. I agree that the magic hate seems to come from players who can't get their heads around dodging spells. Very few mages would beat me in PVP in the end of my playing Dark 2. I would dodge virtually every spell and I'd just say to myself, "" Dumb move,"" because they couldn't get a hit off and I'd move in on them very quickly. I think kids just get mad that they can't win matches.  I do agree that heavy armor should have more stringent strength requirements. It is ridiculous to go up against a high def, high vit mage. That's exploitative of the game's armor system."
darksouls3,3dwzsv,TheCardiganKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"Ah I usually prefer Dex builds over strength to begin with, but I do end up making a pure strength build after a while and do enjoy whacking things with a monstrously sized weapon; it makes a change from using magic sticks and daggers all the time! Yeah I agree on all parts though, but I loved facing against the rare ""good pvp mage"" who utilised spell combos that really threw me off guard and wasn't just the flinging Soul Spears at you. You're also 100% right about the armour though, it should very much be tied to Strength and endurance, or maybe wearing heavier armour makes you cast spells a lot slower since you have to put far more effort into  casting your incantations when wearing such heavy, taxing gear. Who knows, all I care about is that From don't go for the lazy method and just make spells crap to being with (so they don't always have to bother adjusting them with most updates)."

It was very disappointing though, like I'm glad there was at least some form of magic (A Call Beyond) but it wasn't nearly as satisfying (or viable) as I'd hoped it would be."
darksouls3,3dwzsv,OccultVanguard,11,Tue Jul 21 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"The effectiveness of magic should be bolstered by appropriate armour - meaning that although it would be possible to see a havelmage, the spells wouldn't be as powerful as say someone wearing a sorcerer set of some kind.

darksouls3,3dwzsv,Rechamber,4,Mon Jul 20 06:57:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the only reason people bitch about magic being Op is because you get a bunch of heavy armor wearing tryhards who use magic in conjunction with their extremely high defense and poise."

darksouls3,3dwzsv,dks3hypeoverload,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:07 2015 UTC,no more stats please. I don't want another agility-like failure.
darksouls3,3dwzsv,Hexaped,4,Mon Jul 20 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe the developers learned enough from the past to mitigate those steps. Or they'll just give us new kinds of unfair things, and repeat the process. We shall know eventually!"
darksouls3,3dwzsv,AndyLC,4,Mon Jul 20 06:09:20 2015 UTC,"If they do, then all they need to do to teach players how to deal with magic is have red phantoms and enemies that use those spells fairly early on.  My first time dying to pursuers was unfortunate but I can't say its any worse than dying to a [insert hated melee weapon] or backstab fishing."
darksouls3,3dwzsv,dreamcankles,4,Mon Jul 20 06:26:04 2015 UTC,"People get salty about magic in PvP mainly because the lag occasionally causes stuff to hit you even when it looks like you dodged correctly.    Where magic has had real potential to break the game has always been PvE. They approached this in DS1 with a limit on casts, in DS2 by making the DLC enemies extremely spell resistant (or lightning resistant, at least), and in BB by gimping spells in multiple ways. I think they should think first about balancing spells in PvE."
darksouls3,3dwzsv,gwaybz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"Well, not just DLC enemies.   Have you tried killing old knights in Heide or the lions in Shaded Woods with nothing but spells? If you cant wield the Mace or morning star as a mage and go to heide very early, good luck killing more than 3 knights"
darksouls3,3dwzsv,Kamma999,4,Mon Jul 20 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 2 had magic good at the beginning, then the crybabies came in and FROM ended up patching it so bad that lightning spears and crystal soul spears are completely worthless now, and iron flesh has been garbage since ds1 patched it out too. FROM has no idea how to balance things when they patch stuff; they either buff something wayy too much or they nerf it to oblivion"
darksouls3,3dwzsv,gwaybz,2,Mon Jul 20 08:31:45 2015 UTC,"Lightning spears had no reason to be hitting so high when Faith and clerics in general have always been a support role. My issue with the nerfs they did to magic were when they started reducing the cast speed, poise damage and hitbox on spells"
darksouls3,3dwzsv,GothMAXMP,5,Mon Jul 20 11:37:52 2015 UTC,"I think the argument about faith and clerics in general having always been a support role  hardly has any weight, I mean have you seen the intro to DS1?  Yes, the majority of miracles are defensive/support, but the lightning spears are a murder tool. They killed the damn everlasting dragons with them.  Maybe make it so that the spears take up more attunement slots so that you cant spam them and heal like crazy, or any other fix, but simply making them useless is uncalled for"
darksouls3,3dwzsv,Kamma999,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:27 2015 UTC,"poise damage reduction was needed because stone ring affects spells as well and once people started realizing that we started to get some ridiculous bullshit with mega magic missile spamming.  the other stuff, idk.    if i'm honest, from a gameplay perspective, i prefer the DS1 balancing approach to magic.  a soul arrow should one-shot any trash mob enemy at whatever point you're at in the game.  however this ends up being pretty ridiculously fucking OP in DkS - i think the fact that casting costs lots of stamina and is so slow should have been enough to balance it out in DS2.  the overall damage nerf (in comparison to DkS and DeS) to magic on top of that was just overkill.    i understand they want you to play sorcerer different in DS2, that you have to move in on an enemy to finish them off with a melee weapon, but it's just not very fun unfortunately when you get fucked so hard any time you move out of like, football field range.  maybe with more mobility options it would be better in DS3 but i'd still like a return to that ""one-shot"" balancing of the earlier games."

darksouls3,3dwzsv,YokoAhava,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:37:53 2015 UTC,All of the spells designed to deal with rolls or backstabs were really bad in my opinion.

Although, not the bridge near the Old Iron King, that thing is too slanted for the SGS to dream of hitting anyone.

darksouls3,3drity,Vampok,3,Sun Jul 19 12:35:45 2015 UTC,So has it been confirmed whether or not we're back to 2 left and right slots? 2nd weapon showing on the back seems to imply that.
darksouls3,3drity,aiden041,3,Sun Jul 19 02:22:00 2015 UTC,What about bb's transformation attack das3 version ? It would involve performing a special attack mid combo to switch to your second weapon ?  A man CAN dream ...

darksouls3,3drity,AdhinJT,2,Sun Jul 19 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"So I originally thought that's what it was from the leaks. However, if you look both weapons are the same. Now take into consideration they now do dual wielding as a single item to balance it with 2H and to function with there new weapon techinques and... well, yeah thats just a DW set.  edit: As per your examples... 2nd one isn't Katanas. They both have the same hilt. As for the handle length that's purely a perspective thing. They are the same sword, and the 2nd sheath on his back? No swords in it. Same thing for the first pic, minus the sheaths.  re-edit: Does bug me though, why the balls is his right hand using the left-shoulder sword? That shits just... I hope they fix that. And I hope the other swords get sheaths."
darksouls3,3drity,ShivaTheTraitor,3,Sun Jul 19 07:32:56 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see the Ultra Great sheaths.

darksouls3,3drity,Hydrall_Urakan,3,Sun Jul 19 13:26:43 2015 UTC,"Using right shoulder for right hand weapon would make it rather complicated to pull out the sword, especially with heavy armor. Besides, it would be difficult with longer weapons too since you won't be able to move your body freely.   Whereas left shoulder gives you a wide arc to pull the sword out, as well as being able to quickly follow it up with a strike."
darksouls3,3drity,AdhinJT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't change anything. If you can't lift your arms up you can't unsheath the blade. Going over your left shoulder is USING up the extent of your arm in the first place, unless your gumbi. We're talking about 5-6 feet long swords here you'd have to pull that length from your shoulder... from your opposite shoulder.  It's all bullshit, regardless of which shoulder it's on in the first place. You just don't carry anything on your back like that unless your basically stowing it. If your going to unsheath it your taking the whole scabbard and sword off and taking the sword out afterwards.  This is a video game though where we swing giant stone pillars someone decided to shove a handle inside. So... I'm ultimately just complaining that it looks stupid and is actually counter to the way they layed on your back in past game.  If we're talking realism though all manner of shit needs to change... like a lot lol. I feel that would make for a generally less fun game though."
darksouls3,3drity,Hydrall_Urakan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"You're probably correct, honestly. Unless a screen shows up with two different swords, I'm going to assume this is just showing that sword-arts have a passive change to your character model.  Which is nice, it'd be silly to just pull a second sword out of nowhere. Not that we don't do that already, I suppose."
darksouls3,3drity,AdhinJT,2,Sun Jul 19 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly I'd love to see are 2nd weapons displayed. So if that ends up being the case that'll be nice but after learning how the dual wielding works this time around im keeping my expectations low on that front."
darksouls3,3drity,furqans,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"If it were possible, I'd love to see the possibility of doing away with weapon slots being abstracted and instead have them be an actual thing - y'know, you have two hip-slots, two back-slots, and two hand-slots. Or something along those lines. That way all the weapons would appear on your person."
darksouls3,3drity,1upand2down,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely be down for something like that, though I feel like if we're going that route it would make more sense to limit how the back slots work in so far as making it so extra large stuff takes up 2 slots.  Either way I'd be down for it, though plenty of people would be all pissy about being limited. :P"

I know some people thought the health/stamina bars were too small, but it was just fine for me.  Oh, but you know how when you set the DS2 hud to fade, it would first collapse the weapons and stuff in the bottom left to just the items?

In dark souls however, I feel a weapon like this would be very ineffective in most places.

Dark Souls 2 took a far more direct approach to story telling, and I don't think it played out all that well. I think one of the best parts of ds1 for the community was hunting down new bits of lore and cohering it into a full story. Vaati became so popular because he did this so well. The ds1 approach left so many things open to interpretation, it really contributed to the ambiance of the game imo. Dark Souls' version of story telling is one of the things that sets it apart."

darksouls3,3duj50,saint_riot,14,Tue Jul 21 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"I think that a major part of the game is that not telling you the story forces you to explore everywhere searching for it. If they tell you everything up front, there is no motivation to find every item for the descriptions and such."
darksouls3,3duj50,lastpawn,2,Sun Jul 19 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they should flat out tell you everything, they can keep a lot hidden in item descriptions and what not, but within the cut scenes and major points in the story I just think it'd be nice for them to make you care a little more than they have in the past. Give you more of the pieces and leaving you to put the together."
darksouls3,3duj50,Orphanblood,3,Sun Jul 19 17:04:46 2015 UTC,The point where the emotions pour out are the realization you get after putting pieces of the puzzle together. How many times I became flabbergasted after thinking more about the character motivations and exploring the enviroment!
darksouls3,3duj50,Orphanblood,5,Sun Jul 19 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"The history of the world is obscured because, like the story your character is being told, not everything you hear and see is as it seems.  Your character's motivation is usually pushed along by some NPC that tells you a story that may or not be true. If you're content to just play the game and have that story, then it's serviceable and your character is none the wiser. But part of the Soulsborne replayability is you digging around to get to the bottom of the actual story if it's something that interests you."
darksouls3,3duj50,ItsMagicalSteve,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:48:33 2015 UTC,Precisely. There's a wonderful meta-narrative that all Souls games have between you the player and you the character. As opposed to many other games (and movies) where you the player know everything yet your character is too dumb or clueless to figure out the obvious.

darksouls3,3duj50,dks3hypeoverload,22,Sun Jul 19 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, I'd rather have it vague and ""deep"" than being fed a story. Like in books or really good movies where you leave it going ""huh"" than it starts to hit you and you understand the subplot and themes. Dark Souls story isn't hard to figure out, you just have to pay attention. It being hidden gives it more replay value and is part of the reason the games are so good. So ""better job"" and directly are things I find incorrect because I view it's already doing a good job."
darksouls3,3duj50,Nprudym,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"That is a good point, perhaps ""better job"" is a poor choice of words. However, I don't feel the way from tells the story as comparable to hidden themes in movies. If I watch a complex movie, yes it is true that I realize a lot of things after I sit and think about it, but that's only because they give you plenty of meat to work with. I don't think they should straight up spoon feed you the story, but just give you more to work with.  Certain things are meant to stay hidden, but I don't think I should have to go scouring the wikis to fully understand what I just played. All the pieces should be available in game, imo."
darksouls3,3duj50,danblanchet,6,Sun Jul 19 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"All the pieces are in the game man. Where do you think the wikis got their info? Everything else that you see on YouTube is just fan speculation.  Personally, I think that unravelling the mystery as to what happened in the lore is much more fun than being given more cutscenes or descriptions that aren't necessary. It takes a lot of the eeriness out of the world and level design if you know why everything is the way it is from the get go.  But to answer the original question, no. It would be a horrendous idea to spoon feed us more lore than it has in the previous games."

Visuals can really put things into perspective more than reading text can. I get the shroud of mystery the game has and that it is completely intentional. However, there are too many things I feel that you learn about far too late into the game or even when it's already over. I don't mind digging for the whole story, but I don't think I should have to dig that hard for everything in the game."

darksouls3,3duj50,lastpawn,3,Sun Jul 19 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"I could see how you would want this, but a big draw for the souls games for me is being able to figure out things for myself (right or wrong) and feeling like I solved some big mystery! I would be sad if they directly told me the story, because then it would start to feel like every other AAA game with just a really good combat system... It also builds the community when we all get to come together and speculate about the lore and NPC's and item descriptions. All good stuff."
darksouls3,3duj50,slayerofkin,4,Sun Jul 19 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"Well they can still do that, I just feel that they need to provide more context sometimes. More dialogue with some of the important characters so we can understand why they are what they are. A good example of this is with seath I feel. There is so much about him if you dig into the lore and he is a pretty big deal in the universe. However, when you get to him it's just a mindless fight, he attacks you and you kill him. Then it's over. On to the next guy. I just didn't give a shit about him and I feel that's no what should happen. I should feel his pain of failure and betrayal, and I should feel bad about killing him. But I don't. That I think is the core problem I'm trying to describe"
darksouls3,3duj50,tishstars,3,Sun Jul 19 17:39:28 2015 UTC,The intriguing story is what makes it unique. Explain more and it becomes like any other rpg. Apparently there's a lot of people that enjoy digging to get more lore.  It's a more mature way of storytelling that forces you to go out of your way to grasp everything. That's what makes the souls games special.  Make it more obvious you'll hear a vast majority of souls fans deceived.
darksouls3,3duj50,redtoasti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:42 2015 UTC,"Why does from providing more meat to the story make it not intriguing anymore? You guys are acting like I suggested that from should completely overhaul the way they tell the story. That's not at all what I meant. All I was suggesting is for them to give us a little more context up front, mainly dealing with the characters. Sure, digging into someone's lore after the fact might make you appreciate them more than you did originally, but I feel that it's too late at that point.   I think it would be way more meaningful during a boss encounter if you knew right away where they were coming from, why they were there, and what attachment they have to that area they're defending. That would put a lot more emotion behind the fight rather than just simply ""Oh you need to kill this guy, he's important"". That way, you might feel more aggressive because this guy deserves it, or more sympathetic because they're someone who fell from grace."
darksouls3,3duj50,ASaltyTaco,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"More meat, yes. More info on a boss right before fighting him, not always.  In ds2 you only get to know more about the first boss fight at the very end of the game and that was part of the narrative. It was one of those ""Oh shit"" moments that would've been spoiled if revealed otherwise.  What I'm saying is that I'm trusting From to tell us a good story in their own way."
darksouls3,3duj50,GrammyOnReddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty certain from knows what they're doing with the series and will expand in areas they feel best. And I agree, the boss thing was just an example. The last giant made sense to remain unexplained until the end"
darksouls3,3duj50,Shroom_Soul,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:58 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd rather if in their next instalment after DS3 they tried to do this, be more direct in regards with the story. For DS3, I'd like it if they kept the same tone and ambigous story, at least for consistency's sake, though it should be a little more explained imo since you are the dark hero, so you kinda have to know what you have to do in order to break the cycle, i don't think it can be as ambigous as before. But we'll see i guess."
darksouls3,3duj50,Caravaggi0,2,Sun Jul 19 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"The one thing I've never been able to grasp is how much time has elapsed between the events of the story and when your character shows up. Could be a week, could be a hundred years. I've no idea."
darksouls3,3duj50,Brandonmac10,3,Sun Jul 19 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but personally I'm fine with that. It makes it more ominous and depressing, knowing that time is irrelevant, the cycle always repeats itself"
darksouls3,3duj50,AnchorGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"This is a very vague thing to say, if you want to be understood you must give an exemple (some story telling in previous games you would do differently).   None of us know a perfect balance between telling story and not telling story, not even fromsoft. We all like the style, but believe me, as much as many like you find it too hiden, many others find it too direct, and many are fine the way things are.  So i would like you to illustrate what you would think Would be à better balance (and explaine why)"
darksouls3,3duj50,BloodyBurney,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.   It's not that I mind being spoonfed the story, per se. I'm enjoying the Witcher 3 right now. Well, the story, I'm enjoying the story.  But what I love about Miyazaki games is that there is SO MUCH UNDERNEATH. So much hidden. It isn't being vague merely for the sake of being vague and mysterious. The mystery has a thematic role that works with the game as a whole. This is also the reason why Souls games have no easy mode. Because people at From understand that they're making a complete work of art, and the method of uncovering the lore is a part of that package.  Whereas most games reward you with exposition and cutscenes, lore in Souls games is a discovery. That is so rare, OP, so rare... why would you mess with it? :)"
darksouls3,3duj50,Clownprince101,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:12 2015 UTC,I like the point of giving us the basic info and allowing us to make our own theories of what's happening.

Bloodborne slightly took a step in the right direction but it still left too many questions unanswered, and the plot was unnecessarily convoluted. Case in point: the stories definitely need to be fleshed out more for the minimalist angle to work; as they are, the stories seldom catch the attention of most players, nor do they leave any good desired impressions."

I find it annoying that a large chunk of the story is presented through item descriptions, but I love searching and digging for the story.  Maybe if they could somehow translate the story into the actual game more, rather than item descriptions."

We would still get the vague storytelling element but they could use more audio cues.  Like lets say you take your white phantom into some new area and then you get attacked by a dragon and your phantom says ""Oh no! He found me again!"" or you kill a boss and your phantom says ""I'm sorry father."" You can then find out the actual full context in the normal way but it's generally introduced through audio cues."
darksouls3,3duj50,dks3hypeoverload,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:14 2015 UTC,"I like it when NPCs give you a fairly clear-cut idea of some lore element, but only bcause it happens rarely. After hearing guys rambling on vaguely it's nice for there to be maybe one line that adds some context. But if it was all like that then it wouldn't be interesting.  This might be a controversial opinion, but the DkS stories really aren't that deep. If DkS was presented in a way similar to Dragon Age, there really wouldn't be much to it. The reason the story works is BECAUSE it is so vague. Otherwise you just have this relatively generic story about a Thor clone who was afraid of the dark."
darksouls3,3duj50,mordiepants,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a question of how they should tell the story, most people like the subtle method, it's a question of how well they do it.  They tried the same thing in BloodBorne but it simply failed in some parts.  I seem to remember at least twice a message would just pop up after a boss that said ""now go do this"".  And then there were the notes just left around like journal entries - which felt weird in a FROM game.  I'm sure these things were put in at the last minute to ""fix"" the failings.  As long as the dedicate time to it, the old method should work fine."
darksouls3,3duj50,Deadboy90,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"I like the ""hidden"" story. It makes it more interesting when you come across a fan theory or explanation for the more vague things. It's way more fun to figure it out yourself than to just be told something.   I feel like DS2 didn't have as much of it as DS1 though. Like in DS1 a lot of item descriptions had background and I don't see much of that in 2.   I really hope they do add more story on top of the ""hidden"" stuff. I feel like the other two games just give you an end goal and then tell you how to open up the area to get closer (Anor Londo/4 Primal Bondfires) and then give you the next part (4 Lord Souls/Castle part I haven't beaten 2 yet though). I'd like there to be more NPCs that change the story and give you different reasons to do your next task."
darksouls3,3duj50,Ultimafatum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"Games about exploring, making your way through the world, and being part of it. You're not supposed to be omniscient. You're role-playing since it's an RPG. So if you want to be an explorer, you can be and figure things out yourself. If not, then you play the game to enjoy the game.  Overall, the game has always been about earning and learning by trial. The lore follows the concept of the game in which you must earn it by piecing things together. In the end you don't know everything, just like in real life. But your curiosity is what drives you to go further. So I like the story-telling."

It is what you make of it. No greater way to tell a story than that."
darksouls3,3do49c,bluesman7131,45,Fri Jul 17 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd prefer a DS1 style hub. I like being able to choose which area to go, and like you said, is something like a ""crossroads"". Being  placed in a central area and then exploring it from there is more fun imo. Now your making me curious what DS3's hub will look like this time..."
darksouls3,3do49c,tower_knight,5,Fri Jul 17 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yea, people say the nexus is the shit. But for me nothing is remotely close to firelink.  But again i never felt that firelink was a hub, it was rather a crossroads where you meet a few strangers, it never gave me the feeling of home... Hell i never felt safe there.  If we talk about feeling of safety and being at home, then i would GO with the hunter's dream. That place felt like it was my little house with Its little garden, my Alfred (gherman) and my cute and lovely maid (doll best waifu)"
darksouls3,3do49c,aiden041,3,Sat Jul 18 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to see covenant areas come to feel like home, but in instalments so far, they lack anything useful other than the obligatory covenant NPCs.

darksouls3,3do49c,aiden041,4,Sat Jul 18 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"The Nexus is the shit, but I think it worked better for that game.  I prefer the firelink in a Dark Souls game simply because it really does fit with the whole open world theme of design.  Now, if we got a Demon's Souls 2 with it's own nexus, well then.  That would be, in layman terms, the tits.  Or something similar.  If Bloodborne is what happens after the one ending of Demon's Souls (fan theory I know), DeS2 could be what happens after the other.  Or just have a completely new game that's basically DeS2 but under a different name."
darksouls3,3do49c,Chettlar,2,Sat Jul 18 01:50:57 2015 UTC,"If Bloodborne is what happens after the one ending of Demon's Souls (fan theory I know)   Since I'm a fanboy of Demon's Souls' lore and have read through this story faq on gamefaqs countless times, I kind off get Your idea, but could You elaborate or give a link to broad explanation behind this theory? Seems awesome."
darksouls3,3do49c,notrichardlinklater,0,Sat Jul 18 08:12:41 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the theory surrounds the ""good"" ending in Demon's Souls, where you kill what's-his-face and forever end all magical influence. If you'll recall, both magic and miracles were born from the same source - so ending the source effectively severs the connection to them both. Bloodborne, then, is assumed to be what the future Demon's Souls universe would look like without the influence of magic. The Hunter's tools and the focus on medicine is thought to be a direct result of this lack of magic.   EDIT: Vaatividya has a video on this topic, if you'd like to know more."
darksouls3,3do49c,Siegfreud,2,Sat Jul 18 15:18:14 2015 UTC,Yup.  Exactly what I was talking about.
darksouls3,3do49c,Chettlar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"I know so many Die hard nexus fans, and i CAN understand that. It IS like a refuge camp after a disaster for that it's close to majula, but much better and well axecuted, and it feel sacred and old, and again much better of a shrine than firelink would ever be.  For me dark souls 1 and 2 hubs have each half of what the nexus is, but neither realy got it right.  But again majula had that amazing village feel, and as we said firelink is that crossroad lordran fold itself into.  The more i think about it, the more i feel every hub has its charm and liking one over the other is pure opinion"
darksouls3,3do49c,aiden041,4,Sat Jul 18 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"I agree! I don't think that any one of the hubs are ""bad"", each one feels special in a way."
darksouls3,3do49c,tower_knight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yes this. Because we weren't able to teleport right away, and having to walk to a new area and finally coming back to fire link made me feel so relieved and safe."
darksouls3,3do49c,Excaliber77,10,Mon Jul 20 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"I want a DS1 style hub area. Traveling from there to somewhere else and then finding a shortcut back was incredibly awesome. However, certain areas were tedious to backtrack through (Anor Londo + Sen's comes to mind) so what would make the game for me would be an interconnected world like Dark Souls, but each area designed like Bloodborne- an interconnected level with multiple shortcuts. I would still also like shortcuts back to the hub occasionally. But that way, even if you're far away, backtracking to the hub wouldn't be as long or tedious. I don't know how they'll implement warping, if they even will, but this could allow one to play the entire game without warping."
darksouls3,3do49c,CaptainPick1e,6,Sat Jul 18 02:52:15 2015 UTC,I personally love the DkS1 hub. I love the fact that it was part of the world and though it was safe you know right around the corner was danger. Firelink shine was amazing and to me felt like the immersion of the world was constant but I think I heard their is going to be a separate hub in DkS3 though which to me is disappointing. And to note fuck going to one location to level up and everything else.
darksouls3,3do49c,WhoDeyVols,4,Sat Jul 18 06:42:23 2015 UTC,"I love Nexus, Majula and Hunter's Dream, but in Dark Souls 3 I want again to have interconnected world without warping up to some crucial point in the game. I love going back to safe hub, but in DS3 I want to feel as helpless as when I was stuck in upper blighttown bonfire."
darksouls3,3do49c,notrichardlinklater,2,Sat Jul 18 08:10:18 2015 UTC,Another perspective is that since we are nearing the end of the world then maybe a Firelink hub is more suitable from a lore pov?
darksouls3,3do49c,FLRSH,4,Sat Jul 18 13:16:34 2015 UTC,"I usually prefer a hub world, to be honest, like Demon's, DS2, or Bloodborne. However, since we have gotten that in three games now and DS1's style has only been used once, where bonfires or checkpoints are your hubs in the world, I'd like to give that a whirl again. Just for the sake of variety."
darksouls3,3do49c,acebossrhino,4,Fri Jul 17 21:49:40 2015 UTC,DS1 style hub.  Enough said.
darksouls3,3do49c,Dargonsouls,2,Fri Jul 17 22:43:40 2015 UTC,DS1 style hub with as few warp points between areas as possible (i.e. let me walk straight into Anor Londo)
darksouls3,3do49c,Jaujarahje,2,Fri Jul 17 23:55:55 2015 UTC,"Like DS1 style. With leveling at any bonfire. Just not BB style, loading screen on loading screen just to do 10 seconds of leveling was awful"
darksouls3,3do49c,e_0,2,Sat Jul 18 05:19:03 2015 UTC,"See I'm kind of torn on this issue in a way. Both in Dks2 and BB I've had some sort of weird connection with the person who helps you level up. While after 500+ hours, yes, they do get annoying; they also help you out. They're one of the few people in the game who look out for you and inevitably help you achieve your goals, all the while making you feel like they're depending on you to keep going.   On the other side of things, there's the loading screens just to level up. Why should we have to wait to level up when it can be so easily done at a bonfire?   I'm still kind of leaning towards another Emerald Herald / Doll character, simply for the connection, but bonfire leveling up would absolutely be a more efficient method."

darksouls3,3do49c,turroflux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:08:31 2015 UTC,"A pretty hub is nice but being forced to go back there to do anything is irritating, you suddenly dread needing to go back there for every single little thing instead of being able to carry on. Ds1 had it best, being able to do nearly anything bar upgrading stuff at the bonfire.  There should not be a loading screen between you and a series of menus which is what the hub essentially is.  So if it's mandatory to go there it becomes irritating and time consuming and if it's not mandatory to go back it becomes a waste of assets and dev time creating a decent hub area.  If you want something like firelink shrine where it's not hidden behind a loading screen and has a few interesting things now and then, I think that would be the best option."

darksouls3,3do49c,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"I love all of them. Nexus was awesome, but I feel like it was underused. It was enormous, but everything was on the bottom floor. I understand that from a gameplay perspective, but then why have so many more empty floors?  Firelink was atmospheric, but it wasn't much of a hub. It was a place you returned to, sure, but so was the Parish bonfire, or the one near the undead merchant. It didn't have any unique features you can't find anywhere else in the game.  Majula was pretty awesome. It had unique features and merchants and actually felt like a safe haven in a ruined land. What brought it down was the fact that you could just warp to it anytime. Made it less homely.  Haven't played Bloodborne, but I've seen ENB's playthrough. I love how the Hunter's Dream looks, but it wouldn't fit in with DkS. The Dream presented the surreal themes of Bb really well, but DkS needs an area that's more tied to the world. If that makes sense."

By that I basically mean: take everything from DS2 and make it so you can level-up at any bonfire. I liked having these permanent vendor NPCs who got more in stock as the game progressed, but of all tedious things in that game, having to teleport back to M'jula everytime just to level was really annoying."

darksouls3,3do49c,elementalwalruss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, DS2 didn't really have a hub either, it was kinda the same as DS1, you just had to always return to level up. If you had to return to firelink to level up in DS1, it would kinda be the same. Just that the level design was better. I mean, a lot of NPC's were gathering there as well, so actually it was like a hub if you think about it. Just without leveling at the bonfire.  But, what i'd like is, since space and time is convulted, a hub like world, but the same world to appear in 3 different parts, all at once.  So, let's say the first time you leave, you only have one door open, then after you travel a lot, you open a door and you end up in the same hub as before, but through another door.  Since ""space and time is convulted in drangleic"" i think it would be an interesting experience."

darksouls3,3do178,henry_kr,4,Sat Jul 18 06:27:44 2015 UTC,It's the only shield you can get in Bloodborne and it's pretty useless. It even says something about it being useless in the item description.
darksouls3,3do178,1upand2down,10,Sat Jul 18 07:52:34 2015 UTC,"this is the description:   ""A crude wooden shield used by the masses who have arisen to join the hunt. Hunters do not normally employ shields, ineffectual against the strength of the beasts as they tend to be. Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity.""   Its a jab at players of other souls games who never seem to take their great shields down."

There are some sets I really like, but most of the ones I can think of just wouldn't make sense to reappear - not generic or specific enough to warrant it. Like the Sanctum Knight Set in DkS2 - it's not a generic set so they can't just stick it in like Elite Knight, but it's not so fancy as Havel's that they could make it seem relevant."

The DeS dragons, the Hellkite and the Ancient Dragon are some of the silliest points in the entire series. Imagine if the bridge dragon in DeS would, instead of flying the same loop, divebomb you from all different angles, land on the little building temporarily to swipe at you, stick his head in the windows/doors and fill the building with fire, etc... They could have him mostly attack from the air until he's taken enough damage, then his wings would rip (or whatever), and it'd become a normal ground fight (like Khalameet). They could add a ballista or something like Stormruler for non-ranged characters to use at first."

darksouls3,3dlu89,rashandal,10,Fri Jul 17 11:48:42 2015 UTC,so? it was the same in DS and there players got an option to bypass the dragon without having to kill him.  i think it's likely that either we will get the same in DS3 or the dragon is weak enough that it's doable without cheese. you just shouldnt be able to cheese it with hundreds of arrows without any risk

darksouls3,3dlgpe,FLRSH,6,Fri Jul 17 14:13:16 2015 UTC,"Nailed it.  I can agree with all of these actually.  I feel kind of at a lost when people bring up Demon's Souls because so often they seem to want to bring back all the horrible things in it, like health reduction and equipment burden and scraping spear and all that.  Instead of mentioning what made Demon's so great, the atmosphere, and the creativity of the bosses, and the dynamic levels that weren't just places and actually had huge things that you could change in them, like 3-1 and 3-2.  The creativity in Demon's is what I want to see return."

I can return to Demon's Souls even now, with all the hours I've put into it, and still need to tread with caution through 5-1 and 5-2, or feel that oppressive Lovecraftian atmosphere while tip toeing through 3-1 and 3-2. It had missteps like all of the games do, but I still think it's overall the most consistent of all the four games."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,FLRSH,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's very definitely a ""first try of a talented person"" type of a thing.  There's pros and cons to that.  The cons are a bunch of good concepts that were implemented poorly.  The pros are, since it's a first try, there's no precedent, so there's a lot of imagination that goes unfiltered, resulting in a much more creative endeavor."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Chettlar,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"the health reduction in demon souls is one of its best features.   it puts much more incentivation for pvp and co-op.  youre not just invading for the sake of killing another player, you are invading so you can have back the rest of your HP.    ...the other half of your health bar is basically a reward for achieving somehing, be it an invasion, a boss or a suscefull co op session."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,gardenalli,4,Fri Jul 17 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"Except the whole world tendency thing encourages you to not be in human form.  That's bad design because two mechanics are pitted against each other.  And considering online is practically dead, there's even less incentive.  If you die in human form (and you will), you get punished.  I'm sorry but being punished for being punished is just not good design.  It's like in the 1800s a kid would get a beating from his teacher for getting bad grades and then he'd come home and his father'd beat him more for being beaten at school.  It's nonsense.  That's not how to encourage somebody to get better.  It encourages players to do less experimenting and less learning.  ""Oh you're bad? Let's make you worse.""  It only encourages cheesing.  I never felt compelled to cheese Dark Souls, even though that was the first game I played and I am bad at video games (seriously it took me a week to get past Taurus).  I beat the anor londo archers legit because the game didn't punish me for dying.  Actually, that increased the alure.  I lose nothing if I die, but I gain that enormous sense of victory (that the games are known for) if I continue on.  That is design that encourages play of the game.  it encourages fighting on.  Not giving up.  The games have never been about difficulty or dying.  They're about the victory.  Dark Souls was simply more conducive to that.  Good game design has a consistent vision, not mechanics that fight each other."

darksouls3,3dlgpe,Beerdrinkers,7,Sat Jul 18 11:07:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree, actually. Bloodborne does have atmosphere, for sure, however it is constructed in a very polished and calculated fashion, while there's something raw and natural about the atmosphere in Demon's Souls.   The elements that come together to create an oppressive atmosphere, like a grainy, layered, textered visual aesthetic that worlds 3 and 5 have in Demon's, the sound design and ambient noise, the more nuanced use of light and variety and shades of dark used in Demon's Souls, definitely give it an edge here over Bloodborne.  The best comparisons I can come up with for why I personally like the atmosphere in Demon's Souls more than Bloodborne is how some people love the sound quality of a vinyl record over a digital recording, or how a Hammer horror film from the 1960's can feel more oppressively atmospheric than most horror films made nowadays. Bloodborne has too much visual detail, it's too clean and crisp in its images, and it's use of light and dark is more stark, without as many middle grounds. And although there are many ambient noises in Bloodborne, I don't think any of them feel as primal and terrifying as going through 3-2."

darksouls3,3dlgpe,Inferno221,5,Sat Jul 18 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Yup. Compare, for example, the move set for Asylum Demon or Taurus Demon vs The Pursuer, all very early game bosses. Not only does the Pursuer have a greater number of attacks, but a greater variety in the type of attack as well."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,FLRSH,-5,Sat Jul 18 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"Not only does the Pursuer have a greater number of attacks, but a greater variety in the type of attack as well.   Bull, he does the three hit-combo attack and the charge attack which is easy to bait. That's pretty much it. Sure he can launch hexes at you, but only if he used his cursed sword attack. Also he has stupid hitboxes with his cursed sword attack.  Dark souls 1 had a lot of crap to it (reskinned demon bosses, low framerate gutter, lackluster areas after lords vessel) but it made up for it with memorable enemies and bosses. You have the build up in difficulty with the gargoyles, queelag, and the pinnacle fight with ornstein and smough. Dark souls 2 never reaches that level of difficulty, it more or less stays the same, and part of the problem with that is the similar movesets the humanoid bosses have.  The dlc proves this. Everyone had more trouble with the humanoid bosses in the dlcs than in the vanilla game because they had varied/unique movesets that contributed to their difficulty."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Inferno221,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"Simply not true. The pursuer has according to the wiki 6 attacks (if we dont count the triple swing variations) while the asylum demon has 3, not counting again the hammer swing variatons and the leap attack if you stand too long on the ledge. I completly agree with you that most of the humanoid bosses are really awful in DkS 2, but the Pursuer is not one of them."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Nakroma,-3,Sat Jul 18 21:47:14 2015 UTC,Simply not true. The pursuer has according to the wiki 6 attacks   His attacks aren't that complex though. They're really simple and have little follow up to them.
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Inferno221,4,Sat Jul 18 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"OK, let's take a step back here. Asylum Demon has the following attacks, and will be the first boss you face:   Backwards swipe. Float drop. Two handed overhead. One handed gap closing overhead. Pile driving attack. Horizontal swing.   Pursuer is potentially the first boss you will fight, if you climb up to the right area, and has the following moves:   Impale cursing attack. Blue projectile from sword. Dark magic attack. Gap closing upward diagonal swipe. Shield bash. Horizontal swing. Three hit combo where he is hiding behind his shield and poking at you. Three hit combo that ends with a leaping, 360 spin horizontal attack. Three hit combo ending with an overhead slam.   Now, we can see that not only does the Pursuer have more moves than Asylum Demon, but they are more complex. Asylum Demon does not have a magic, a dark, and a grab attack like Pursuer does, and lacks the variety of combos the Pursuer does, instead having mostly simple one hit attacks, or occasionally chaining two of its listed attacks together. The Asylum Demon's most unique attack, it's float drop, does not compare to the several differentiated attacks of Pursuer.  Now, let's compare the Pursuer to a likely next boss you will face in DS1, Taurus Demon. These are the Taurus Demon's Attacks:   Horizontal swing. Ground stab. Leaping smash. Standing smash. Platform destruction.   Even fewer attacks than the Asylum Demon, and no combos. No unique attacks outside of using his weapon for big one swings. One damage type only.  Now, just for making the point, let's compare Pursuer to even another early game foe in DS1, which you could face after Taurus Demon, the Capra Demon:   Leaping attack. Heavy side swing. Horizontal swings, going up to potentially a four hit combo.    Even less than Taurus Demon, and only one damage type, no unique moves.  Are you getting my point?  Edit: And the Last Giant could potentially also be your first fight in Dark Souls 2. Let's add him in the mix. His moves include:   Belly flop. Foot stomp. Foot stomping frenzy. Hand smash. Club hand smash. Hand swipe. Club hand swipe. When he leaps backwards or around the arena, getting clipped by him damages you.   So, The Last Giant still has a greater number of attacks than Asylum Demon, Taurus Demon, and Capra Demon. While he only has one damage type and is not as dynamic as the Pursuer, he at least has two stages, one involving a really cool dynamic of tearing his arm off as a club weapon, and the belly flop move."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,FLRSH,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I never said asylum demon/tarus demon were hard, but that doesn't mean the pursuer is a good boss. You're also forgetting that what made the Tarus demon ""hard"" for some was fighting him on a bridge.   Pursuer was pushover easy, even more so when you find out you can use the crossbow bolt and do major damage to him."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Inferno221,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't about whether a boss is tough or not, its about how complex a boss is in their attack patterns. Pursuer alone outclasses the first three bosses of dark souls 1 easily in complexity of how it fights."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Rileyman360,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And even the Last Giant, although he does not have the same variety as Pursuer, has a higher move set than the first three DS1 bosses, too."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,FLRSH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"OK, we need to clarify a few things.    I'm not talking about difficulty. Not in my original comment about what I want to see back in DS3 from DS2. Not in my last response to you.  I'm saying I want bosses in DS3 to have deeper move sets, meaning more of a variety of attacks and higher numbers of them. Generally speaking, DS2 bosses have higher move sets than bosses in DS1.

darksouls3,3dlgpe,Ralonne,5,Fri Jul 17 07:27:53 2015 UTC,"DS2: Netcode. Fucking please.   I respectfully disagree. Now, I've watched /u/damnnohtml's videos about the topic, and he did an excellent job of explaining the differences between the one-way hit detection of DkS 2 vs the two-way system of the other Soulsborne titles. He pretty much ended this 'broken hitbox' bullshit debate with those videos, and for that alone he needs to be thanked a thousand times.  However, while I appreciate his explanation and premisses, I do not agree with his conclusion. This conclusion seemed to be ""the slow hit registration in Bloodborne breaks my immersion, so the one-way hit detection is better"". Ofc I respect his perception of things, but mine differs significantly. My immersion was never impeded by DkS 1's or Bloodborne's slower hit registration to a comparable extent as it was in DkS 2 where I roll away from, say, a straight sword or small axe R2, find myself 10 feet away from my opponent who swings his weapon in the air, and I get hit. Even now that I know why it happens and how this can be avoided, I still yell 'bullshit' when it does happen. It also makes thrusting weapons like rapiers and spears absolute hell. We all know those cases where the opponent stabs the air 180 degrees away from us, and yet we get hit. In DkS 1, I can just step to the side of a spear thrust which misses me on my screen by a few inches, and no dmg is registered.  I think the one-way hit detection was the right system in the wrong game: It would have been perfect for Bloodborne, where stamina costs are low and dodge moves are quick and easily ""spammable"". This means that players can be in iframes for a lot of the time, so that the disadvantages of the one-way hit detection (phantom hits) weigh far less than in Souls games, especially DkS 2. There, the action is much slower and dodge moves cost much more stamina. The combat feels far less frantic and much more tactical, and so I feel a hit detection that relies on accuracy more than it does on quickness would be much more fitting.  Since DkS 3 seems to be very close to DkS 1 in mechanics, I sincerely hope for a two-way hit detection, although improvements to it are always welcome."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,DamnNoHtml,6,Fri Jul 17 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"Ideally they would have the two-way detection with the latency of Dark Souls II. Miracles happen, right?"
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Reapercometh,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:29 2015 UTC,"Do I sense sarcasm? ;) Ideally yes ofc, although you explained very well how the low latency (I guess you mean on hit registration) is pretty much a product of the one-way hit detection (at least that's how I understood you). So having the best of both worlds would be heaven, but probably a bit much to ask. I realize it's a trade-off, and the one-way hit detection is not bad in any way. It's just that given the choice for a Souls game, I'd prefer the two-way system, while I completely understand why you prefer DkS 2's system.  Or were you serious, and if so, do you see the possibility of bringing the best of the two together by optimization?"
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Spyger,6,Fri Jul 17 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know, Nyff-chan...  I've been hit (and have hit others) in some pretty damn wonky ways during DkS PvP. I can't remember if you saw that one vid I made (DkS gameplay), but there were more than a few cases of ""I'm waaaaaaay the hell over here, HOW did that hit me?"".  The thing I didn't mention in that video, was that 90% of the players I encountered that day were in Texas. The same state I live in.  Either way, I really hope DS3 optimizes netcode a bit more in-depth. Maybe some latency compensation/prediction."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Nyffenschwander,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, you will never hear me say DkS 1's netcode was perfect. It really wasn't, and shady shit definitely happened, especially when heavy latency was involved.  However, I think you know those examples I was giving and how DkS 2 differs in that from DkS 1. No matter what system they will be using in DkS 3, heavy optimization would be welcomed by us all, I think."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,Spyger,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know whatcha mean!  Here's to hoping for an improved multiplayer!"
darksouls3,3dlgpe,linusalmroth,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:37 2015 UTC,No sarcasm at all. That's what I actually want :P
darksouls3,3dlgpe,linusalmroth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:27 2015 UTC,If it's 2 way in bloodborne and ds1 and ds2 is one way then they'd have to make the latency much much smaller for 2 way to work as well as the 1 way would they not since it travels both ways. the 5 frames from ds2 quickly and easily become 10 add in a quick comparison logic to see if the hit should count and that could easily add more to it.  Ideally yes we hope they make it work
darksouls3,3dlgpe,AndyLC,4,Sat Jul 18 01:33:23 2015 UTC,"If your experience in DS2 was as bad as you say consistently, then I'm sorry to tell you that you have a terrible connection.  For people with bad connections, DS1 style is clearly preferred. It becomes a sort of guessing game, in which you try to play 2 seconds ahead of time. In DS2, laggy matches are simply races where each player dices up the other. I actually prefer the DS2 way, because you can finish it quickly and move on, instead of floundering about.  Additionally, the phantom range attacks in DS2 only happen when you are moving away from the target. In this way, it rewards aggression and skill (rolling to dodge instead of just to get away), and punishes runners.  It was so, freakin, hard to kill anybody who decided to run in DS1. And while it may be frustrating to get hit by a weapon that missed by 3 feet, it is way more frustrating when you nail someone in the face and they're just like ""nope"" and backstab you."

I know how the systems work and what their advantages and disadvantages are. And I never said my experience with DkS 2 is terrible, the system is just how it is, with all its pros and cons.  I'd simply prefer a two-way hit detection, ideally with reduced latency on hit registration through optimization."

darksouls3,3dlgpe,CryKat,2,Fri Jul 17 07:54:05 2015 UTC,"well of course there are some duds but they all have some super memorable characters, imo at least  and that really sucks.  i haven't had as many issues with it, most of my matches are either like one dash ahead of time pretty consistently or just a few frames off when it's good.    it helped a lot when i set my PS4 to a DMZ on my router as far as finding connections go though, so maybe that could make it a little more tolerable for you?"

DS1: The NPCs and side quests. They were the deepest and most fleshed out that we've seen from the series so far. I would like more of them and on an even larger/more ambitious scale.    DS2: The UI/HUD with a little bit of tweaking. The HUD of DS2 was sleek and sexy. I was very disappointed when I found BB had no auto-hide HUD. The grid based UI lent itself well to the plethora of items in the Souls games, and fixed the inventory problems of DS1. I do want it to be slightly tweaked by having larger icons for each item, and the ability to view stuff BB item description style with the press of Square/B.    BB: The fluidity/variety of animations. BB has separate animations for the way you've been knocked down and then roll out of being on the ground, and expanded weapon movesets. There's so many little details to the animation that just subconsciously make the gameplay feel that much better.   Overall, I really believe that DS3 has the highest potential to be better than any of the Souls-Borne games in just about every way. The developers just need to cherry pick the best things from each game and combine them in ways that make the most sense."
darksouls3,3dlgpe,eternal_wait,3,Fri Jul 17 13:28:31 2015 UTC,"i'm totally with you on the auto-hide, loved that feature.  BB's UI is so condensed though, it surprised me a lot when i first started playing.  and the first time i saw that rolling flip thing your character does, and realized you do a different animation for ALL 8 directions you can ""wake up"", i was sold.  so cool and so much fun.    i think DS3 is gonna be awesome - they know what we like and what we don't like, and have done an amazing job at delivering stuff we didn't even know we would like too.  hype is real"
darksouls3,3dlgpe,eternal_wait,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"I like the way BB's UI is condensed too, but they were only able to do some of that because of the smaller amount of items overall. I would enjoy it if when you pressed start a BB style menu popped up, and then when you went to select your item/equipment the grid would pop out. Seems like a win-win.   The wake up animations are like my favorite set of animations in the entire game. That extra level of detail goes a long way.   I'm pretty confident in DS3 too. I've never been disappointed by a Souls-Borne game and it just seems like the team has everything going for them this time around."

OR - what about this - what if when you're killed while human by say, a hollow knight, they actually take your humanity, become human and are then NPC level of difficulty?!?!  so you could reclaim it by killing them, but it would be much more difficult than fighting them while they're hollowed.  so it would be both more punishing and a little less frustrating at the same time possibly, like, your humanity will always be there waiting if you can work up the guts to kill that enemy (it doesnt just evaporate like DkS) but it's not gonna be easy reclaiming it."

darksouls3,3diulw,KeyBenji,11,Thu Jul 16 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"This definitely needs to be in there. Dark Souls also had some weapons which had semi-chainable R1-R2 attacks, but it never felt like a consistent feature. Bloodborne introduced it on a bigger scale, and I never experienced any problems with stunlocking. If anything, constant R1-mashing is what results in stunlocks. R1-R2 combos just makes the combat seem even more dynamic, and expands greatly upon the moveset of any given weapon. It just seems like a natural addition after being tried and tested in Bloodborne, and I think we can expect it to be in DaS3."
darksouls3,3diulw,Siegfreud,10,Thu Jul 16 18:08:17 2015 UTC,yeah I think From found a really good balance with stun animation timings and push back in bloodborne. Stun locks were still possible but only if you were really reckless and just ran into someones R1 saw cleaver spam.   I also hope they keep different attacks for rolling R1 and R2 and stepback R1 and R2. It adds a nice touch of variety like the chainable R1-R2 combos.
darksouls3,3diulw,RummyTummy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 2 had a few ""chain-able R1-R2"" weapons, as well. Not to mention a second R2 (different from the first R2).

If you're trying to just throw it out without charging it, it's slow/delayed, and not as fast and fluid as the rest of the combat. The L2 attacks partially solved this problem, and weapons without charged R2s were fine, but I hope DS3 has more fluid R1-R2 combos, like with the bastard sword or broadsword in DS1."

darksouls3,3dnu3n,philipmariekun,27,Fri Jul 17 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"Speculating here, I think it was their intention to create disincentives for low level PVP, because they saw it as synonymous with the problem of twink characters invading much lower leveled hosts in the early game.   Fire and lightning now scale off intelligence and faith which is very weird   nitpicky correction: all Fire damage now scales off of Intelligence AND Faith, and all Lightning damage scales off of Faith only. Conversely, spells that dealt magic damage scaling off of Faith in the first game (like Emit Force and Wrath of the Gods) do Lightning damage in DS2. I think it was intended to give each type of damage its own specific niche in the stat lineup.   and even then raw weaponry doesn't really do as much damage as say a claymore+10 on a 40/40 build.   Why should it do as much damage? 40/40 is an enormous stat investment compared to a weapon's minimums. Raw is a cool tool when scaling on a weapon is bad for your build, but it shouldn't be offensively competitive with dedicated weapon-DPS builds, since you have the ability to invest in defensive stats and secondary stats.  Also: Do you want Giantdads? This is how you get Giantdads."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,Stiqqery,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't MIND  a giant dad. If it's in the game (with the exception of tranquil walk of peace, the ONLY ONLY thing I feel should never have existed) I'm all for finding ways at countering it. It's just a zweihander, a high poise build with the ability to fast roll. it's SL 99 so it's not really that hard to fight against.  Again, I agree with raw weaponry, that not even chaos or lightning weapons should do as much damage as +10 weapons on a 40/40 build. I just wanted a 12 dex, 16 strength build to be viable. I wish they wouldn't had discouraged low level PVP; I want to bring back the days or Krazy and Red Rosie lol."

I get the goofy getup and the weirdly straightforward combat style, but you need to understand that giantdads existed as a feat of defensive optimization (combined with the fact that Chaos weapons scaled with your soft humanity and made successful PVP builds snowball, but that's another story.)  If something similar to DS1 Fire/Chaos weapons existed in Dark Souls 2, what we'd be dealing with is an entirely new level of Haveljester that can afford to pump so much into Vigor that even a victory would be tedious. Moreso than that's already the case, that is.  Do you remember pre-nerf Santier's Spear builds? Yeah, that, but potentially with any melee weapon in the game getting similar effects."

That is my main problem with 2, that you have to go to every place on the map to get the desired items you need for every single build. Youl will always need at least 2 fragrant branches, a merchant to buy a weapon from and the dull ember.   I wish they made it so that every path had its own resources like in 1 and Demons. In 1 Tomb of Giants was reserved for faith, Oolacile and Dukes for magic, Lost Izalith and Blighttown for chaos and pyromancer paths, new londo for melee characters. In Demons world 1 was for healing items, 2 for upgrade materials, 3 for magic materials, whilst 4 and 5 I'm not so sure about.   In Dark Souls 2, there isn't much rhyme or reason. Items ar ejust placed haphazardly."

Part of the issue was that not all the upgrades were worth much of the hassle of getting the items unless you want a platinum. Dark Souls 2 was extremely streamlined and I have a very large and general distaste for most of that game. I'm okay with having different blacksmiths for different upgrades. I wouldn't mind that, so long as it's not a bitch to deal with. From a lore standpoint, they worked in generally why each blacksmith did certain upgrade paths. It's a toss up. I want a blend of the two. I felt it to basic and just I dunno, ""un-dark souls"" (IMO) to me, but to each is own. Dark Souls 2 upgrading wasn't bad at all, and the general hate must stem from how people view it as ""souls-like"" it is as that seems to be the basis for everyones disagreements between the games."

darksouls3,3dnu3n,FLRSH,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:20 2015 UTC,In what way does this happen?
darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,15,Sat Jul 18 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"Some things should be complex. Like enemy AI. Or world layout. Or NPC backstories.  Other things should not. Like a ton of different embers for different upgrade paths, where there are different levels of that one ember for that upgrade path, often with different upgrade materials that get messy and even redundant. And a lot of those upgrade paths have extremely limited overall use in the game, or no use at all for your character.  And it's nice being able to just need one kind of ember for infusions. Infuse a weapon to match your build or damage type choice, then infuse it with something else once you're done with that.  DS2 did what really needed to happen with the upgrade system. It cut out a lot of tedium with intermediary steps that didn't need to be there (like upgrading a weapon just to turn it into another kind of weapon just to upgrade that, or getting different levels of a certain kind of ember spread out sometimes in very late game). It added flexibility to how you upgrade and then can un-upgrade, or then change your upgrade of your weapon. It also kept the specialization with the multiple kinds of damage types you can put into your weapon. So, it got rid of redundancy, uselessness, and tedium while keeping or augmenting flexibility, specialization, and simplicity.   It was a wonderful change."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,FLRSH,3,Fri Jul 17 21:44:56 2015 UTC,disagree 100%  i much rather have all the different types of upgrade materials.
darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,4,Fri Jul 17 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"Well, you get three upgrade materials for weapons in DS2: titanite, twinkling titanite, and petrified dragon bones. It's nice that they made upgrading all weapons simplified and streamlined by keeping it to three upgrade materials.   However, you're not losing specialization, variety, or highly differentiated upgrade materials, either. Instead of red, blue, green, white, blah blah blah titanite, you get faintstone, firedrake stone, boltstone, darknight stone, poison stone, bleed stone, etc. for infusions. They each have a bit more personality rather than just calling all titanite different colors, and you are still getting plenty of variety in your infusion choices and materials. It's a great system, really."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,FLRSH,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"yeah but the reason i dislike this is because the different types of upgrade materials added to the replay for me.  i guess its not the titante as much as the different blacksmiths,   i liked the side quest of getting the fire, and chaos weapons in darksouls1.  it made it so with different character builds i would run the game in different order so i can upgrade my character the quickest  darksouls2 ended up being the exact same path through the game everytime"
darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,8,Fri Jul 17 22:07:49 2015 UTC,"Red, blue, green, white titanite did nothing for me. Looking for the same embers in repeated playthroughs, did not do anything for me, personally. Did not feel very sidequesty, more grindy.   My issue with the blacksmiths is that none of them are very interesting NPCs, aside from maybe Andre, but that original lore significance of his was scrapped.   Dark Souls 2 gives a lot more to do than the previous two games, in terms of areas, tracking down things, etc. I'm definitely OK not having upgrading my weapons being that thing that keeps me running around like a chicken with my head cut off."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,FLRSH,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:23 2015 UTC,"running around with your head cut off?   there are actually less places you need to go with different titanite types like in DES and DKS1, that's the whole point, if you a mage you go to ONE area to upgrade him, if your dex guy you go to a different ONE area to upgrade-  instead of darksouls 2 where you have to go to all areas in the same order over and over to upgrade every character you ever create, no matter what build you choose   also good NPC?  darksouls1 were vastly superior....   and gotta say the areas were much worse in darksouls2 than in dks1, BB or even demons souls for that matter, there is pretty much no-one who thinks that darksouls2 improved the world design, and am surprised if you think it did.  that was a whole string of bad opinions sry."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,9,Fri Jul 17 23:09:25 2015 UTC,"What? Why are we talking about a comparison of NPCs? I'm not comparing anything, I'm simply stating the more blacksmiths we got in DS1 did not equate to a greater experience, partially because they're some of the least fleshed out and least interesting NPCs in that game.  Wait, why are we going to all areas in DS2? I'm confused, I'm not entirely sure what you're arguing. Why are we talking about world design? Are you just looking for an excuse to put down DS2? Because I'd rather not get into a discussion with you on the old DS1/DS2 argument."

IE skeleton blacksmith in catacombs,  giant blacksmith in anor londo"

darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,4,Fri Jul 17 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"You can specialize your weapon to a great degree with the infusion stones. Bleed, mundane, raw, etc. You get a total of 9 infusions, that's plenty to give specialization to weapon crafting in DS2.

darksouls3,3dnu3n,Jackist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:20 2015 UTC,why not do low level pvp?  they literally added the Agape ring just to fix not allowing low level pvp
darksouls3,3dnu3n,superlittlegirlyay,0,Fri Jul 17 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you that a raw or chaos weapon shouldn't do as much damage as a pure weapon, especially not after such big investment in both strength and dex. In 1 chaos weaponry still did split damage equalling it to doing less.  My problem mostly comes down to the idea that the only path I will be able to take on a low level character will be raw. I really wanted a lightning or fire weapon to fight against specific targets."
darksouls3,3dnu3n,BustaBen88,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think the problem boils down to you trying to have a low level PVP character in a game that uses SM matchmaking. With no benefits from not leveling up, From probably designed it that way because it is expected of you to level up(?)"

darksouls3,3dj09e,Shroom_Soul,20,Thu Jul 16 17:38:49 2015 UTC,What do you mean when you say that Aldia is part of the first flame? Isn't he just someone twisted by Chaos?  Edit: Downvotes? Sorry for asking a question to further discussion
darksouls3,3dj09e,Knight_Lunaire,11,Thu Jul 16 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to think he's twisted by Chaos, but nothing in-game suggests that Aldia ever had anything to do with Chaos.  He studied the First Sin, which was Gwyn lighting the First Flame. So that immediately means that he could have a connection to the First Flame. Plus, he can only materialise through Bonfires, yet is free to move around in the throne room, which is basically the Throne of Want. It seems clear to me that Aldia was researching the First Flame as a method for ending the Curse, and managed to fuse himself with it. He has nothing to do with Chaos."
darksouls3,3dj09e,WhoDeyVols,3,Thu Jul 16 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't played scholar of the first sin, does aldia story change or at least bring more light on him from the original?"
darksouls3,3dj09e,Knight_Lunaire,5,Thu Jul 16 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"No. Aldia as an NPC isn't changed.  I guess there's one minor thing. The Forlorn, who randomly invade you at certain points, are said to be people who were separated from their worlds by Aldia's experiments.  EDIT: Oh, you mean you haven't played the patch? For a start, it seems that Aldia managed to integrate himself into the First Flame, gaining a sort of immortality while sacrificing his human form. He can only manifest through bonfires and in the throne room (which is most likely the kiln). You beat him at the end, but he doesn't drop any souls, and continues to speak even after he's faded. This implies that he's still alive, and could very well have a role in DkS3."
darksouls3,3dj09e,Knight_Lunaire,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:25 2015 UTC,Aldia was in the original DS2?
darksouls3,3dj09e,SkippyLeDoo,7,Thu Jul 16 20:13:26 2015 UTC,He was patched in.
darksouls3,3dj09e,skabbo,4,Thu Jul 16 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense, yet it still isn't a clear connection. He may have connections with the flames in general, but what would make it the first flame, that originated thousands of years ago?"
darksouls3,3dj09e,SkippyLeDoo,5,Thu Jul 16 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Because the First Flame is basically the centre of everything. It's the source of the Curse, which Aldia wanted to put an end to. It was linked by Gwyn, which is what the First Sin is. The fact that he only really has power inside the Kiln is pretty good evidence that he is tied to it in some way."
darksouls3,3dj09e,skabbo,3,Thu Jul 16 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the source of the curse than the lack of it is.  As for Aldia, most speculation for him being linked to Chaos has to do with his aesthetic, though many don't realize that it is also the same as the archtrees, which existed aeons before the Chaos. However that aesthetic of Chaos might be due to it not obeying the same rules which the Flame abides by.  That being said, I still believe he was twisted some way by the Flame, if not a flame of his own creation, becoming similar to a demon. Though, since he was likely twisted around the First Flame itself, he is able to remain lucid while transcending the curse--true to its nature and unlike those touched by Chaos.  Furthermore, since he became tied to the Flame, by letting it go out, he will also likely cease to exist, not just go hollow."
darksouls3,3dj09e,10303816,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the source of the curse than the lack of it is.   I dunno about this, I reckon that the only reason the curse exists is as a symptom of the First Flame feeding off of the Dark Soul in all humans and thereby cursing a few of them to become hollow. I think what Gwyn did was ""link"" the first flame to Humanity, hence why it seems like predominantly humans present with the undead curse and nothing else other carriers of humanity such as dogs and rats.  I think this is further supported by the fact that after Gwyn ""linked"" the flame he himself turned Hollow. I think he had to have been carrying at least a sizeable fragment of the Dark Soul in order to Link the First Flame to it. Probably in the hopes that the First Flame would continue burning by using the Dark Soul as fuel.  However it backfired, and so now whenever the first flame is about to extinguish it instead becomes embers. As far as we can tell for 1000 years the First Flame burns and then it becomes embers, however instead of fully extinguishing it will remain embers and the undead curse continues to spread and intensify until it is linked again.  I think, the First Flame NEEDs the other three Lord Souls in order to be fully replenished, however it will now fall back on the Dark Soul in order to keep burning as embers."
darksouls3,3dj09e,falconfetus8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:42:49 2015 UTC,"The Flame burns all souls. Gwyn became hollow because he lost lost most of his soul and began to revert back to his original state from the age of ancients.  Also, I think embers are just the natural progression of flame dying. Each aspect of flame--light and dark--are no more or less a part of the Flame than the others."
darksouls3,3dj09e,Wubmeister,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"Embers are a natural progression but they aren't eternal. As far as we can tell the embers of the First Flame can last a very long time, even after Vendrick left it alone the flame was more or less in the same state as when it first went dim."
darksouls3,3dj09e,napoleon_wilson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  One thing people forget is that the Bed of Chaos was a failed replica of the First Flame, so it stands to reason that it would look a bit like the First Flame. The First Flame that we see in DkS1 is dying, so it looks like a regular bonfire, but in its prime it probably looked a but like the BoC, minus the twiggy person sticking out the top. Aldia looks the way he does because he was twisted, or became part of, the First Flame.  And yeah, you're right that if the Flame died Aldia would die with it. It's interesting that he seems to encourage you to let the Flame die. Adds an element of tragedy to his character; if the Flame died, his suffering would end."
darksouls3,3dj09e,ThatOneChappy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:18:46 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking off this, when you defeat Aldia, he says ""I lost everything but remained here patiently.  The throne will certainly receive you."" Which sort of affirms that Aldia entered the throne and resides there with the flame.

These are the roots of our world.  Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite…  A lie will remain a lie.   Aldia implies that, whatever Gwyn did, was responsible for how we humans are now. As in, once the flame starts to fade, we start to go hollow, which means that we can't have a true Age of Dark since we will all be hollows, which seems to be contrary to how it was originally meant to be.  It seems to imply that Gwyn possibly linked humanity as a whole to the First Flame, making us rely on it, assuming a ""fleeting form"", thus causing the undead curse (which only starts to happen once the flame starts to fade). The undead curse also makes humans almost willingly sacrifice themselves to the first flame to prolong Gwyn's precious Age of Fire, since the flame keeps the curse at bay."

darksouls3,3dm9mz,AngryBaby,12,Fri Jul 17 12:31:26 2015 UTC,I'm waiting to pre order until they announce the collectors edition

I think. Correct me if I'm wrong! I would wait in case they announce a collectors or stuff like that."
darksouls3,3dm9mz,TheSinrei,2,Fri Jul 17 12:38:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure for Dark Souls 2 pre-ordering automatically got you the ""Black Armor Edition"" which came with the steelbook case, soundtrack and certain weapons/shields unlocked early. The ""Collectors Edition"" had all of that and also a Faraam Knight statue and maybe a map of Drangleic."

darksouls3,3dm9mz,OldKingChump,-6,Tue Jul 21 23:02:56 2015 UTC,You should never pre-order. No matter how juicy the pre-order bonuses look.  And a collectors edition is most likely going to be there the whole time.   It boils down to being careful with your money. Applies to everything.
darksouls3,3dm9mz,skull_of_nito,16,Fri Jul 17 13:52:40 2015 UTC,"Ummm good advice I guess? As a huge DS fan though, I can assure you I will be pre-ordering the most expensive majestic grossly incandescent collectors edition they offer."

darksouls3,3dm9mz,skull_of_nito,2,Sat Jul 18 04:11:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that DS PC Port will echo through the ages
darksouls3,3dm9mz,Chettlar,0,Sat Jul 18 17:11:43 2015 UTC,"I think a better reason to not pre-order is because it encourages developers to continue to be lazy and release broken games (or maybe not so much laziness as publishers forcing developers to release their games in a broken state).  However, I will make an exception with souls games, and only souls games.  Because these games have always been complete, fantastic games (even if rushed sometimes).  And when they do DLC, it's great DLC that's better than the main game every single time.  And instead of releasing a half-baked game and finishing it with DLC later, FROM makes an entire game that stands on it's own, and continue to support the game years after release."
darksouls3,3dm9mz,falconfetus8,-2,Fri Jul 17 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"DS2 had some armor as a preorder bonus, but it was hard to actually locate it.  And when you actually found it, it was worthless.  So don't bother preordering; digital copies don't go out of stock."

But for Dark Souls you also have the whole undead, revive at bonfire idea. My idea is bosses dont just dissappear and even if they dont revive there corpse is still there. So they get buried or w.e and something is casuing them to revive."
darksouls3,3djvxz,Sarcastic_Red,2,Fri Jul 17 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting thought to be sure.  Obviously there are technical reasons for bosses disappearing (especially on the RAM), but the way they disappear seems to have some lore implications as well."
darksouls3,3djvxz,Chettlar,3,Fri Jul 17 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"What if the giant lord held the first flame, and thats what vendrick stole from the giants. the thing is, the first flame brings with it the curse, because light must always cast a shadow, and as such vendricks kingdom was brought down by the curse. so gwyn was a lord of cinder, so was the giant lord, and who else? maybe player characters, maybe other dimensions chosen undead, who knows. Ive assumed that the ""furtive pygmy"" is always the chosen undead."
darksouls3,3djvxz,shitsfuckedupalot,2,Fri Jul 17 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"The Giant Lord (yes, I strongly believe that's who it was) was a major threat who brought Drangleic to its knees. I think he would garner enough respect to get a proper burial.  Anyway, I believe that the new DkS2 ending will be canon in DkS3. I feel like they released SotFS to better connect DkS2 to DkS3; why else would they release it so soon before DkS3 was announced? So this means that the Bearer of the Curse is not a Lord of Cinder. So the only confirmed Lord is Gwyn, with the Giant Lord being a strong possibility."
darksouls3,3djvxz,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:44:04 2015 UTC,What is the new DkS2 ending .
darksouls3,3djvxz,ThatBlueHatGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, did you not know? In SotFS there's a new ending you can choose if you kill the new final boss, Aldia. Basically, you choose to not take the Throne, and Aldia's dialogue implies that you seek something beyond light and dark."
darksouls3,3djvxz,Shroom_Soul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:40:18 2015 UTC,"Wow I actually really like that being added to the game. I mean when I beat Dark 2 for the first time , I felt that all the incredible feats my character had accomplished really were not worth it for the pathetic reward of becoming the king or queen of the land the population of four dozen people at tops. But I really prefer this new ending. By the way is scholar of the first sin good enough to justify playing the game again ?"
darksouls3,3djvxz,ThatBlueHatGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 11:34:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes. If you have a PS4, XBone or PC with DX11 capabilities you should get it. The game is just so much better. Last-gen SotFS is just a Game of the Year; just the old game with all 3 DLCs.  Also, Aldia and the new ending were patched into last gen DkS2 anyway, so if you have it you can see all that anyway."

darksouls3,3djvxz,ThatBlueHatGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"Probably PS4, since the current-gen SotFS improved online features. I'd say a lot of people will have moved on to PS4.  Do you have DkS2 for PS3 already? If you do don't buy SotFS for PS3. You'll just be getting the exact same game. I'd get SotFS for PS4 anyway because of all the changes."

darksouls3,3djvxz,WhoDeyVols,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:22:56 2015 UTC,"If every new lord linked the flame, then yes, there'd only be one. But if some lords departed from the flame, becoming the Dark Lord and keeping their souls, then a number of them would have accumulated over the eras. The flame would always be relit by some moron and these Dark Lords would either die, continue living, or go hollow. Vendrick is an example of this: he did not link the fire as he was meant to, and he intentionally hides his soul to stop Nashandra at the expense of him going hollow."
darksouls3,3djvxz,Ex_Outis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"I see why the OP stated this question: Gwyn the Lord of Light turned into the Lord of Cinder AFTER he lit the First Flame.  But what happened after Gwyn linked the fire?  He essentially sacrificed what we would call his mind as fuel to light the flame.  In this sense I don't think being a Lord of Cinder means you HAD to have linked the fire.  I think it can mean that one of the original Lord Souls (Light, Dark, Death, Life) now resides in a completely hollowed form.  Then again depending on if you think the Furtive Pygmy split the Dark Soul among what would become humans then every hollowed enemy we see is a Lord of Cinder.  And Gwyn split his soul among Seath and the Four Kings so....  A hollowed vessel that contains x amount of the original Lord Soul = Lord of Cinder.  What is X?  30%  40%  More?  Less?  No clue.  That's what I take from it though."

Smart move that will be certain to help them drive sales. My problem is that these insufferable mini-celebs will be accepting heaps of free shit while doing promo work for DS3 and then expect everyone to accept their word about the game as gold.

darksouls3,3dgp7p,CrayolaAutumn,3,Thu Jul 16 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Problem with Bloodborne stats is that the soft caps are obscenely low. Such that by the meta level cap you can conceivably use every weapon in the game with reasonable strength, this translated into poor build variety.  It was completely oversimplified. It might be good for Bloodborne but its too simple for Dark Souls."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,skabbo,3,Fri Jul 17 06:49:21 2015 UTC,sounds like the wrong meta level cap was chosen.  how was it chosen?
darksouls3,3dgp7p,rashandal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:42 2015 UTC,"Dunno, but the current metal evel cap is between 100-120. You start to see diminishing returns in all stats at about 25, the ACTUAL soft cap is at 50 but you will see very little change in damage between 25 and 50 due to a combination of poor scaling on most weapons and the extent of diminishing returns for each level over 25.   Add to that that there are only 6 stats, Arcane is effectively useless and you have a huge amount of health and stamina even at only 20 and you get a game where your stat decisions almost don't matter and even if you balance every stat at about 20 you'll hit the upper metal level cap and will be able to use most weapons with minimal issues."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,skabbo,3,Fri Jul 17 08:03:16 2015 UTC,sounds more like the meta level shouldve been much lower than the usual 100-120 then.
darksouls3,3dgp7p,rashandal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its similar to dark souls as all skills can be raised to 99 however the way skills sort of work in conjunction with weapon requirements and scaling just means that your build will be pretty much done at level 50."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,skabbo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:38:06 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree.  Dark Souls is much more complex and much larger.  I definitely want it to remain that way, and I trust Miyazaki and his team to do something interesting based on how much they've learned so far.  But Bloodborne always felt more like an experiment, a novella as opposed to Dark Souls' epic poem-like quality.  I expected something short and sweet, and my expectations were wholly exceeded."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,CrayolaAutumn,10,Fri Jul 17 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne's system is over simplified. (But I also complain about Bloodborne lacking content.)  I prefer having more strategical depth and (build) variety.   However I do agree that luck, res and adp were useless or (even worse) mandatory. (You have to level adp to 20ish to get a proper amount of i-frames.)  Ninja-edit:  BTW Dark Souls 2 has 9 stats:   VIG (HP) END (stamina) VIT (equip load) ATN STR DEX ADP INT FTH    Because: DS1 had vitality (HP) and endurance (stamina and equip load)"
darksouls3,3dgp7p,1upplus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"Personally I think equip load makes the most sense being tied to strength. Stamina is okay, but having a stat dedicated to it sucked ass. I wound up playing through DSII as a dex build, just using the wanderer's set +5 because I didn't feel like dumping 20 points into VIT to not be overencumbered by wearing a fucking feather."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,VFB1210,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:46 2015 UTC,But str or dex would be bad as well. That would mean that you would end up always having a str or dex build because equip load is that important.
darksouls3,3dgp7p,1upplus,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:46:27 2015 UTC,Because 'streamlined' is a cop out. Bloodborne didn't even touch the sides of my dark souls hunger. It was fun for like three weeks whereas both of the souls games are still being played by myself. The only option you get REALLY is how you want to look and which weapon you want to use
darksouls3,3dgp7p,TheVagaKnight,8,Thu Jul 16 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"streamlined is not a ""cop out"".  this entire series has been built upon the philosophy of design by subtraction.  removing all the bullshit baggage to make the purest possible action RPG experiences is like the entire point.    it's like me saying that DkS's open world was a cop-out for them to not have to create a better hub area, or that poise is just an excuse for them to not to actually have to balance the game organically through hyper-armor.  it's just not true - it's a design decision and a very intentional one at that.    and the main option you get in bloodborne is pretty straightforward - how you want to play.  they gave us greatly extended and deeper combos and combat system overall that takes a lot of influence from straight-up character action games.  it's about player expression on a different level than just equipment and stats can offer.  i think the way DkS games give players choice is great, too, but it's just a little bit silly to disregard BB when it obviously has so much more technical depth in the moment-to-moment combat and the number of ways it gives players to react to any given situation.  in bloodborne, it's never, ""i died cuz i did the wrong thing,"" instead it's something like, ""i died cuz i got too ambitious/wild"".  as long as you can maintain your focus the world is your oyster in BB.  that's not how it works in souls.    just saying, different players enjoy different things and my time with BB has already almost surpassed my playtime in all of the souls games combined.  i hope they continue the ""streamlining"" approach because it makes the games more fun to play, which is what it's all about.  it's part of our job as players to be receptive to new ideas and ways of playing if we want to continue to get good games."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,GothMAXMP,2,Thu Jul 16 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"If Bloodborne was longer and had a lot more content then I would like it more than the first Dark Souls, but it is really lacking in stuff to do. I flew threw my NG+ in a few hours of playing Bloodborne because I knew what to do. If I tried a NG in Dark Souls without even dying once I probably still couldn't get to Anor Londo in that time doing just the main stuff. There's also a ton of side stuff in DkS.   The combat was a lot better in Bloodborne. I feel like that's what they spent most of their time working on and it really paid off. The combos are great and there's a lot of variety with the transformations having their own moveset. They should have made transformation attacks quicker though. The saw spear was the only usable transformation attack."
darksouls3,3dgp7p,Brandonmac10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"i can understand that.  i really enjoy the chalice dungeons and i like making tons of different weapon-specific builds and seeing how playing through the game is with each of them.  i've almost surpassed my entire combined Souls playtime actually and probably will in the next month or so.    i can totally see how it's just not different enough for some players tho, especially RPG-centric ones.  i actually play a lot of character action games and really enjoy them, which sort of necessitates playing them over and over and over and over and over again, with the approach to individual combat scenarios being the only real big differences each time.   in comparison to those, BB has an amazing amount of variety and depth, which has just it made incredibly addictive for me, as in i have a stack of other games i need to play, like witcher and DMC4 and batman, and still cannot stop playing BB even after several months of constant grind.  and actually, i think the only NON-usable transformation attack is LHB.  with almost every other weapon there is at least 1 B&B combo i use frequently that has transform attacks.  they usually are lacking the hyper-armor department but have great modifiers and range."

darksouls3,3dgp7p,rashandal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly you could make a good build that left ADP completely alone. I found it far more satisfying to learn how to play with minimal i-frames instead of just trying to max them out. In most of my builds I leave VIG and END at about 10 or 15 and put my levels into damage dealing stats such as STR, DEX, INT, FTH, whatever I need.   Puts me at a huge advantage so long as I remain careful, most people will waste points in their VIG, END and ADP and it leaves them weaker than me."

darksouls3,3dgp7p,Perenthis_,6,Thu Jul 16 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"How about a stat that controls counter damage, taking the stat away from weapons themselves, to balance out the VIT/END requirement heavy weapons have?  This way, faster, lighter DEX weapons would require investment in two stats to get the most out of them, just like INT, FTH and typical STR weapons require ATT or VIT/END to use them at all.  Either that, or make fat rolling not a death sentence, if that's how they want that type of character to play.    My UGS character in Dark Souls 2 has to have 50 VIT to have just a Greatsword equipped, and enough defense to make use of the hyper-armour and survive punishes.  I could switch that character to DEX, do more damage with combos from attacks that are easier to land, use much lighter armour and save myself 36 VIT points that I could use to give myself a weapon buff with decent duration to do even more damage, and GMB.

darksouls3,3dgp7p,GothMAXMP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:55:35 2015 UTC,Bloodborne streamlined the stats to  Vitality (Vitality) Endurance (Endurance) Strength (Strength) Skill (better name for Dexterity) Bloodtinge (a Bloodborne-specific stat) Arcane (magic + elemental damage)  I thought this was very simple and sensible -- 6 stats -- while still providing for diversity.
darksouls3,3dgp7p,lastpawn,3,Fri Jul 17 10:26:11 2015 UTC,"A big issue people have had in Bloodborne is the lack of build diversity and options with their characters, comparatively. I don't believe the Souls series should try and emulate Bloodborne's over-simplicity."

Vitality doesn't interact with any weapons or items in the game and is only there to make you more resilient, but then upgrading ANY stat already raises your defense.   If I upgrade STR, DEX, END, FAI, INT I am working towards a character build, and even Attunement is a tradeoff of versatility vs further specialization. Vitality is just ""eh I got some points left over to meet the Soul Level meta""."

Motoi Sakuraba does wonders with what he has, using those choir samples to their fullest potential(The trailer theme for Dark Souls 1 still sends shivers down my spine, despite the fact that it uses basic synthesizer strings and was recorded on a toaster that still had the toast inside) but hearing him do the Dark Souls style with a live 92-man and a real choir would probably send my erection all the way up to Pluto faster than New Horizons could ever dream off.   The trailer theme sounds live. Either that, or it's insanely well put-together. The female solo has a dynamic vibrato that's nigh on impossible to achieve synthetically without samples, but the tone transition again sounds way too natural for that to be the case.   Either way, wouldn't matter much. Listening to tracks like Ornstein & Smough, and Sinh, The Slumbering Dragon assures me that DS3's soundtrack is in the right hands."

darksouls3,3dh6p7,Chettlar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, there's an issue with that interpretation. Although Demon's, Dark, and Dark Souls 2 were all digital, I feel like if people got together and gave a close listen, the sound quality, that orchestra feel, was the best in DS2's score. So, when an OP points out DS2 as an example of how it would have sounded better with a live orchestra (which, of course, all three Souls games would), it kind of feels like he's unfairly using it as low hanging fruit to critique, when the sound quality is absolutely worse in Demon's and Dark Souls."
darksouls3,3dh6p7,FLRSH,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have clarified more. I'm not singling out just DS2, I knew that previous installments used digital instruments as well. It was just the first that came to mind since i played it more recently along with Bloodborne, giving me a chance to compare it together. Anyway, i agree with you on DS2's score."
darksouls3,3dh6p7,FLRSH,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding! I totally understand, makes sense. The big thing to remember on the Soulsborne subs on reddit, is that there are constant wars going on between fans of the games. A lot of people love DS2, and unfortunately because of some haters out there, they're forced to defend their game a lot. So when something like this happens, where it appears DS2 is being singled out unfairly, it triggers that defensive mode. It sucks that people have to keep this in mind in posting, but it may be helpful in the future."

Dark Souls 2 had really good ideas but they didn't mesh together very well, and in Bloodborne I don't know why they bothered at all. I want covenants to affect your PVE gameplay as much as your PVP.  I really want Dark Souls' lore style to come back. Dark Souls 2 usually either flat out tells you something, or doesn't give any hint of any explanation at all (like Old Dragonslayer). Bloodborne comes closer, but it already feels like pretty much everything is either known or unknowable at this point. Where with Dark Souls 1 people are still coming up with great theories that make perfect sense."

darksouls3,3dgksm,linusalmroth,5,Thu Jul 16 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"I want weird and quirky online mechanics, like the vagrants and bells tolling in DKS 1, such mechanics really increased the mystery surrounding the game. My favorite thing about the egghead mechanic was the characters automatic head scratching beforehand, I really hope we'll see something unique like that."
darksouls3,3dgksm,ANoobInDisguise,4,Thu Jul 16 12:07:36 2015 UTC,"The bell tolling in Dark Souls 1, yeeees. What a great way of giving a lone journey a small sense of unison."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Brenin_Madarch,3,Fri Jul 17 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the miracle resonant rings, I dunno I just really liked how few mechanics were explicitly explained to you. When you'd get more estus charges because someone else kindled your bonfire, before you understood how it worked, it made the whole experience feel magical. Hopefully Miyazaki brings back some secretive mechanics like that."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Meto1183,3,Fri Jul 17 09:58:08 2015 UTC,"Rat covenant but better and put it in a crucial area.  Loved the idea but it needs some work to not be ""toxic rats and hexes, have fun lol"""
darksouls3,3dgksm,linusalmroth,3,Fri Jul 17 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I want the map-design style of Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne, and it seems like we're getting that. I also want the much tighter movement engine of Dark Souls 1, which it also seems like we're getting."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Meto1183,2,Fri Jul 17 00:28:51 2015 UTC,I was happy to hear they were getting DkS1 movement back. I can't stand DkS2 movement.
darksouls3,3dgksm,bloodabeast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"Which part? I've just started ds1 and have had a pretty rough time with the movement, obviously it's a transition, but I don't see where ds2 is bad or what is so good about ds1's"
darksouls3,3dgksm,BustaBen88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered I believe Dark Souls 1's movement was animated from scratch whereas Dark Souls 2's movement was motion captured, correct me if I'm wrong please. Also in term's of rolling, you get to the top your fast roll quicker in Dks1 than in Dks2, resulting in a more satisfying ""Bunny Hop"" movement."
darksouls3,3dgksm,ph33randloathing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:06 2015 UTC,Dark Souls has tighter movement. But in particular it's about the lock on mechanics I believe. DkS2 has omni movement lock on and DkS1 has 4 way movement lock on.
darksouls3,3dgksm,ThatOneChappy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:13 2015 UTC,I don't understand..isn't rolling any direction better?
darksouls3,3dgksm,ph33randloathing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person. I love the 4 way rolling, makes the combat tighter."
darksouls3,3dgksm,ThatOneChappy,3,Sat Jul 18 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"Would love to see world tendencies make a return. They gave so much variety to the gameplay in DeS and much added replay to each stage. Maybe also,"
darksouls3,3dgksm,bmxisgoodforyou,2,Fri Jul 17 12:03:38 2015 UTC,yeah at least something to change an area and give reason to go through it again
darksouls3,3dgksm,Borberry,7,Fri Jul 17 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"More weapon attacks. Dark Souls 2 most certainly has more weapons. No denying that. But so many of them share the exact same attack animations, which means that you can very often just ""math"" certain weapons into uselessness.  While Dark Souls certainly reused some animations, I don't feel like the problem was as rampant (even account for the increased weapon options). At the very least, I'd like weapon movesets to vary a bit more (mix and match different ""straight sword"" moves depending on the sword).  Also, bring back my damn Warpick.  I'd like to see Poise mean more. Maybe it doesn't need to be quite as ""these are the break points"" as in Dark Souls, but it was so worthless in Dark Souls 2."
darksouls3,3dgksm,ph33randloathing,6,Thu Jul 16 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"The reuse of move sets was a thing in both the first and second game, if anything I feel the second game had more quirks to certain weapons."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Borberry,2,Thu Jul 16 10:28:29 2015 UTC,"Certainly both games reused move sets. Maybe it was an echo chamber effect from there being far more weapons but roughly the same number of animations. The DLC weapons varied things up a bit, to be fair. But there are plenty of weapons that are just meaningless that could be given life with movesets.  Take the Scimitar vs the Falchion. They are identical in every way except that the Falchion is just pants-on-head better from a math standpoint.  I'm not saying every weapon needs totally unique animations. But if you have a pool of attacks for weapon types, mixing and matching so no two weapons have identical ones could give life to EVERY weapon."
darksouls3,3dgksm,KeyBenji,3,Thu Jul 16 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, I just think its a wide spread problem in both games and not just DkS2."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Shroom_Soul,0,Thu Jul 16 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yes for example, many weapons in ds 1 only have one strong attack animation."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Vivit_et_regnat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:30:55 2015 UTC,"Poise is definitely not worthless. Unless you're talking about pvp in which I haven't seen poise matter much, yes"
darksouls3,3dgksm,BustaBen88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:13:28 2015 UTC,"Poise has some value in PvE, but certainly not as much as it used to. It is virtually meaningless in PvP."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Darrida2,2,Thu Jul 16 18:25:54 2015 UTC,I'd say it's extremely valuable for running through areas and going through fogwalls/ opening doors without getting knocked out of the animation. It's been helping me a lot on permadeath runs
darksouls3,3dgksm,LangisQc,5,Thu Jul 16 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"One thing from Bloodborne actually, linking R1 and R2 attacks so there's more of a moveset variety."
darksouls3,3dgksm,FLRSH,4,Thu Jul 16 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"Dual wielding and powerstance. The idea that I might only be able to dual wield scimitars really bothers me. I want to be able to use a greatsword and dagger, or even two shields. I don't want weapons to be restricted to right hand."
darksouls3,3dgksm,FLRSH,0,Thu Jul 16 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"I was sad to see only one set of shields could be powerstanced. That's one of the few ideas I liked about DkS 2. It added more damage, but not enough to make them super op, just enough to justify not using a shield."
darksouls3,3dgksm,prxncetxn,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Dragonslayer Spear.
darksouls3,3dgksm,FLRSH,2,Thu Jul 16 06:35:57 2015 UTC,"character movement from ,DES,DKS,BB, any but DKS2 really.  not to hate super hard, i think DKS2 did many things better than any of the games.  But the character movement was horrible and it hurt the game in the end."
darksouls3,3dgksm,SpirasGuardian,5,Fri Jul 17 22:48:44 2015 UTC,"NPCs with less exposition.   I like that D'ouls 1 showed me the story, and didn't tell me the story."
darksouls3,3dgksm,nfank,16,Thu Jul 16 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"""D'ouls 1"" seriously??"
darksouls3,3dgksm,V-Cliff,3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:31 2015 UTC,DS2 didn't have any weird armor sets?   http://darksouls2.wiki.fextralife.com/Moon+Butterfly+Set
darksouls3,3dgksm,RectalRagnarok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that weird. Odd, maybe. But it also doesn't belong. Egghead and whatnot actually fit into the game. And the butterfly set poisoned all the npc's and made it inconvenient to wear."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Grakniir,5,Thu Jul 16 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"That seems mightily superficial to differentiate odd and weird here. But that's just my opinion, I feel they're all in the same class of weird and goofy outfits that people wear for laughs and to amuse people they're PvPing."
darksouls3,3dgksm,theoneforgotten,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Nah dude, it's only good weird when DS does it. If DS2 does it it's bad weird."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Xethaios,2,Fri Jul 17 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Haha, right on."
darksouls3,3dgksm,Brenin_Madarch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:28:58 2015 UTC,Definitely to bring back unique covenants that have major pros and cons.
darksouls3,3dgksm,ANoobInDisguise,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:56:26 2015 UTC,"A connective world, like DS1"
darksouls3,3dgksm,ANoobInDisguise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:09:54 2015 UTC,Useful Llyod Talismans.  Pls.
darksouls3,3dgksm,Xethaios,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Polished, sharp graphics. Doodads. Proper reflections.  Basically make it DS1 with better models and textures."
