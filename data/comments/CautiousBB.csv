CautiousBB,3e4kp1,smutsmutsmut,4,Tue Jul 21 22:22:20 2015 UTC,We had our last RE appt today.  I have an OB appt next week... they don't need to know I had an ultrasound today.  I need all the tummy scans!!!
CautiousBB,3e4kp1,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"Oh that's brilliant! Today was my ""graduation"" appointment from the RE, as well. I need to find a new OB, though, because the one I was seeing before we went away to IVF Land goes to a hospital that I don't love. So I can't turn around and call on my OB, I have to find them first..."
CautiousBB,3e4kp1,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"We are in a shitty situation with our OB Office. We have a brand new gigantic hospital. Which over the past couple years has sort of taken over. They are almost the only medical providers in our city now. They have everything from therapists to dentists.  Which seems convenient, everything is linked to the hospital, but it allows them to provide medicore care.  I'm worried that after fertility treatments and having a high risk pregnancy I won't get the care I think I need. I had my RE go through my time line for finishing my Prometrium and asked her everything I could, because I'm scared my new doctor won't care.  And a huge CONGRATULATIONS to you!"
CautiousBB,3e4kp1,Catty_Mayonnaise,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:21 2015 UTC,"You could get a little Doppler from Amazon. My husband can't take off work for OB appts, so I picked one up for like $40 so he can hear the heartbeat whenever he wants. It's not as exciting as a US, but it's a quick fix when you're jonesing lol"
CautiousBB,3e4kp1,k2p2,2,Wed Jul 22 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly like that picture!!! Lol! I'm getting extra scans next week (28 weeks), 32 & 36 weeks to check her growth as apparently I started with a low BMI (rubbish! I calculated I was bang on healthy BMI when I got pregnant!). She's always been bigger if anything so I'm sure she's fine, but getting to see her again makes me so so happy :) Come on Monday :)"

Nice to see you here! :)  As for feeling hot, that happened to me at 4 weeks, too. I'm a whole whopping 5 weeks now, and I'm managing the heat with a fan directly on me almost 24/7. I think you can blame almost anything on the change in hormones when you're pregnant. And as long as you're not running a fever from the heat, the baby should be fine!"

CautiousBB,3e2lsf,naners225,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:42 2015 UTC,Thank you! So this was actually my second appointment. They gave me an early ultrasound since we had a loss last time around.

CautiousBB,3e3l1v,naners225,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hey! Not that similar but I was born with a congenital heart defect. It's called a ventricular septal defect, basically a hole in my heart. It's tiny now but caused me problems as a very young baby & child.   It never closed on its own as it was meant to & surgery seems pointless as it no longer bothers me as my heart has grown & the hole has not. But I still go blue if I'm cold & pushing certainly scares me! With not as much oxygenated blood going round I'll get exhausted quickly & I really want to try for an intervention free birth...if I'm that wiped out if I'm in it for the long haul, it worries me I may need help.  It's genetic apparently so I had a fetal echo scan to check if my daughter had inherited it...looks like she hasn't!   I also have ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease which I am on meds for & have been in remission for a couple of years.  So I hear you on being nervous about having health problems. I can't help but know you're not alone :)   Edit: I am SO rude! I meant to start off with MANY CONGRATULATIONS!!!"

It also kind of sucks that my birthing process won't be natural in any way shape or form, but that's just how it is.   It must have been great to see that your daughter didn't inherit the condition! I'm ""lucky"" I guess in that mine isn't genetic, so I don't have to worry about that. I just got it out of bad luck, which makes me constantly think that more bad luck will come my way.

CautiousBB,3e02xn,HazMat68W,18,Mon Jul 20 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath.  It takes immense amounts of stress to affect your baby and it's very unlikely to cause a miscarriage. Right now, your baby is pulling nutrients from the yolk sac while the placenta forms. The placenta doesn't take over until the 10th week of your pregnancy, so your baby isn't getting any of the cortisol (stress hormone) and is completely safe in your uterus. During the first trimester, there's nothing you can do to avoid a miscarriage. If it happens (which is much less likely since you've seen a healthy heartbeat), it's not because you were stressed or because of something you did.  ♡ I'm so sorry about your dad. It's hard to lose a family member, especially a direct family member like a parent.. my dad died in 2006, so I can only offer you internet hugs! Good luck."

I'm so sorry to hear this!   Seriously, though, unless you express grief in an incredibly self-destructive and bizarre way (like recreational methotrexate or risky parkour without any training), you are not going to cause a miscarriage by your emotional response. There is just no need to pile that guilt on top of the scary shit going down. Grief is a normal part of life, and plenty of women have had healthy babies in some pretty awful circumstances."

I don't think you need to worry about losing your baby due to this stress.  But the best thing you can do to get through it is practice really good self care.  Be kind and forgiving to yourself.

At about 12 weeks along, I was visiting him when he had a heart attack.  I raced him to the hospital.  He survived, but we've found out he has a SUPER rare form of cancer.  Since then, he's had at least two more heart attacks, the heart surgeon says there is nothing to be done, and there is no prognosis or protocol for his cancer.  He's not on chemo pills that I cannot go anywhere near.  Some days, we think my grandpa will not survive the night.  I am currently 25w6d.  Baby is still doing fine.  She's kicking all the time and growing at the correct rate, even though I've felt indescribable grief.  Breathe.  Continue taking care of yourself and baby.  Try to sleep as much as you can.

While the situation is similar, I cannot imagine how you feel. Take a deep breath. Hug some friends. Think of happy memories. See if your mom or someone else can hold a phone to his ear so you can wish him well.   Take care of yourself. Be sure to eat. Be sure to sleep.

Also, as long as cramping isn't severe & you're not bleeding fresh red blood/filling a pad....you're more than likely okay.  I read a lot of books, I crochet (although I haven't done that for a while actually), I play with my cats.

It's hard to wait, and I do feel like getting excited is going to jinx it. Even though I don't believe in jinxes! Ugh.

CautiousBB,3e0b2l,hopefaithandlove,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:22 2015 UTC,I peed on one then stuck another in the toilet water. The toilet water one was much stronger than the directly peed on one. It's like a pee stick graveyard.   I also only have one left. I'm holding on to it until next week. Even though I'm sure it'll be useless by then anyways.
CautiousBB,3e0b2l,FluffykinsDontCare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:02 2015 UTC,I still check the toilet paper every time I go to the bathroom - not sure when this stops :(   Our first appt with the midwife isn't until Aug 18 because the midwife assigned to us would be on vacation. They left a msg today that they need to switch us to another midwife but left the appt the same week. I'm going to call tomorrow to see if I can get an appt the first week in Aug at 10 weeks instead of waiting until mid Aug! I'm not great at the waiting either.

CautiousBB,3e2b91,septicidal,3,Wed Jul 22 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"Hormonal changes throughout pregnancy can trigger or exacerbate issues like anxiety and depression, and other mood issues.  Please talk to your OB and see if you can get a referral to someone who specializes in pregnancy and mood issues to see about some additional support.  You don't need to feel this way!"
CautiousBB,3e2b91,tinatrying,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"So first of all, older ladies have a way of ""knowing things"" sometimes.... BUT that doesn't mean a random encounter should have ever ended with someone touching you without permission. Here's the thing...if you weren't pregnant and she did all that, how would that make you feel as well?  Her behavior was totally inappropriate.   Don't feel bad about lying.  It was never her business to begin with.   As to the anxiety, believe me, you are not alone. Talking to someone does help sometimes (I previously went to a babyloss counselor after my daughter was stillborn and I am starting back again today because I am also very anxious about this working out, and I know it will help me).  Is there anyone you feel comfortable talking to in real life about your miscarriage fears who can give you support?  Many states also provide counseling when you are pregnant, even if your insurance doesn't cover it most of the time, because prenatal and post partum depression is so real for so many women. If not, maybe join a few more online boards to get different perspectives from different groups. Even though you may feel that way sometimes, you aren't alone."
CautiousBB,3dyt67,cheddarkitty,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"Try not to feel guilty.  It is normal to feel hesitation or reluctance to engage emotionally with a pregnancy when there are concerns about how things will go. Your heart is trying to protect itself from the possibility of heartbreak.  If you haven't already decided to do so, I would recommend moving forward with genetic testing (the non-invasive prenatal testing doesn't carry the miscarriage risks of CVS or amniocentesis) so that you know for sure if there is a chromosomal issue.  Even if it doesn't change your feelings about the pregnancy, it will help your medical team best prepare for birth and any potential complications arising from chromosomal issues.  It is also easier emotionally to cope with a diagnosis if you have time before birth to adjust to it. I think it will also help you be more excited about the pregnancy to know for sure what is happening.  Whatever happens, try to be kind to yourself.  It sounds like you have had a rocky road thus far with this pregnancy, and everything you've described sounds like a very normal, human reaction to it.  Your baby is not going to be harmed because you weren't deeply emotionally invested from the moment of conception."
CautiousBB,3dyt67,septicidal,3,Mon Jul 20 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"I second this.  CfDNA tests are non invasive and have ridiculously good data for a test that is just a simple blood draw for the mom.  As Insurance figures out the best methods for these tests, the individual labs (Progenity, Maternity21, etc) often make deals with OB offices to provide them with a max out of pocket for you.  In my case last year it was only $25 out of pocket to both know the gender of my baby at week 12 as well as have much better information regarding chromosomal outcomes."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,mrs_zpc,2,Mon Jul 20 11:02:18 2015 UTC,"Here goes. It's my birthday tomorrow. I'm 18 weeks and 5 days. I still just look fat. I have to try really hard to look pregnant. I've been wearing tights and things to round out my cake bump.  And with my extra insulation and anterior placenta I'm still waiting to feel some decent movement. There have been butterflies and goldfish flutters in there. But nothing consistent or really feeling like definite baby.   I have to watch my weight or be classed as high risk. I've eaten half a bag of natural confectionary company snakes and 2 reeses peanut buttercups that my hubby picked up for me to have for my birthday because he got me a voucher.  Really, I have nothing much to moan about. I'm reasonably healthy and so far so is this baby.

I'm probably the youngest healthiest looking person that gets in and I'm waiting for someone to tell me to take the stairs because I don't need the lift. But I've been standing on my feet all day and I am pregnant tired on top of normal tired! So while waiting for the lift I push my tummy out as far as I can so no one says anything!

My left hand is hardly useable at this point and my left foot is killing me, on top of all my other joints getting sore. Basically no anti-inflammatory meds are safe for pregnancy so I can't take those like I normally would. I see my midwife on Friday so I'll ask her then what I can do to help get this under control again, as well as talk to my rheumatologist as a next step.  And I would really like to take a bath to get a half hour of relief, but our bathroom is currently getting remodeled and we have no bath tub.

I can't find any correlation with daytime activity - for example, my husband and I took a decently long walk yesterday but I also had the pain the night before when I hadn't taken any walks. Makes me sleep horribly. And I poked husband in the butt with the pillow I had between my knees and woke him up. Oops. Felt bad about that.  Also, maybe I should have saved this for TMI Tuesday, but - I'm so sick of all the friggin' discharge. Blech.

CautiousBB,3dxldf,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"The only problem is that we're really short on people this year, and have more work than usual to do. I think they'll be fine, especially if they can wait a week for one guy to get back from vacation. He can go instead.   Part of the problem as well is that I work with almost all men, nearly none of which have kids. The one pregnant woman that they worked with in the past had a unicorn pregnancy and was happy being in the field practically until she gave birth. So that's all the experience they have with it. I'm having to teach them that I'm really not 100% anymore."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"I would check with your OB but then honestly tell work, ""My doctor is not comfortable with me being outside in the heat at this point in my pregnancy, in the type of weather we've been having.""  And leave it at that.  Obviously check with your OB first in case someone later demands documentation, but... You need to take care of yourself.  The risk of dehydration in pregnancy is very real, and can contribute to preterm labor or other issues.  Plus you would be far from your normal medical team if there were a problem.  I've had to learn how to say ""no"" a lot more firmly.  It's hard to be in a position where you want to be part of the team and do what's needed, but have to respect your physical limitations."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah the main thing my doc said was to stay hydrated. It isn't super easy doing that in the field, especially when bathrooms are nowhere near readily available. I do need to learn to say no, to stick to my guns and not feel bad about it. This stage won't last forever."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,FluffykinsDontCare,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:06 2015 UTC,"This seems so silly and stupid, but I am getting increasingly frustrated with not being able to figure the true age of this pregnancy. I'm having a couple of problems; I ovulated on sometime between 8am on cd13 and 8am on cd14, which is when I temped each day. My husband and I had sex on CD12 and CD14 (am, after I saw the temp spike on CD14), so conception had to occur sometime late on June 30th or early July 1st. So, to figure out the true age of the pregnancy, would July 1st be day 1 plus the previous two weeks (2w1d?), or would it be day 0 plus the previous 2 weeks (2w0d?). But since 7/1 was a Wednesday, and 6/18 (CD1, but really pregnancy day 0??) was a Thursday, my ""weeks"" don't reset until Friday. So all the charts and apps and everything say that, based on my LMP date, I am 4w4d today, but I don't think that's true. I think it's 4w6d based on my approximate conception date. I know it's only a difference of 2 days, but it makes a big difference for a) decreased chance of loss and b) stage of development. My other problem is that none of the apps and websites for tracking development make any sense. I really enjoy tracking the development process, but all the resources seem so off! A week ago, when I got my BFPs, the apps all said the egg was maybe just getting fertilized and there was no way I would get a positive test for a week. Now they're saying that the egg just implanted just now?? How is that possible when I got a BFP over a week ago? I'm sorry, I know this is so petty and unimportant in the scheme of things but it's really making me feel so frustrated and crazy! I just want to stop staring at calendars and trying to make it all make sense, but I can't let it go."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,jwad1246,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in your boat too lady. I O'd on July 3, BFP on July 11. So I've KNOWINGLY been pregnant for 16 days. Does that mean I'm 4 weeks or 5 weeks along? Ugh it's driving me crazy. I know all will be worked out at first scan, but WHEN can I do my first scan is my question? I want to go in asap!"
CautiousBB,3dxldf,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"The difficult thing is, even knowing the minute you ovulated... The egg can live for 24 hours and could have been fertilized at hour 20 or later.  Or immediately after ovulation.  So there would still be a 24 hour window for conception, even knowing the precise ovulation date.  I had an early ultrasound through my RE that measured perfectly on track with my IUI date, but my subsequent ultrasounds measured one day behind that (possibly because the baby was super squirmy on the NT scan and they had difficulty capturing good shots to take measurements).  And the IUI was technically the day after I ovulated.  So based on my ovulation date, my due date is 11/26, but based on ultrasound at 7 weeks it's 11/27, and based on later ultrasounds it's 11/28.  My OB is unworried about it and will use the later date for determining induction, etc. but the dates are all so close it doesn't make any difference for any other testing/monitoring.  I guess the only advice I have is to use whatever due date/gestational age you feel most comfortable with.  I have been mentally using the 11/26 due date because it lines up with my ovulation and it's Thanksgiving, and it's just plain easier to remember Thanksgiving than ""the Saturday after Thanksgiving"".  I also try to remember that the baby really doesn't care about his due date.  He'll decide to make his entrance whenever he's good and ready to, so ""late November"" is what I've told work and other people who have asked."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,FluffykinsDontCare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much worried about the due date, since babies can be born a week+ on either side of the estimated due date... I more want to figure out whether it's still just a ball of cells that just implanted (which is what my apps say... Even tho it had to have implanted at least 10 days ago!) or if it's an embryo and developing organs (which other websites say), or what is going on in there!"
CautiousBB,3dxldf,Empiricalbaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"The usual dating scan happens around 11 weeks, and this can give a more direct date.  However, unless it is off more than a few days, they usually stick with the due date.  Mine is about two days off from the date based on LMP, which makes sense knowing that I ovulated on Day 15 or 16, instead of day 14."
CautiousBB,3dxldf,mothergoosetobe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"Right now I've been going based on my ovulation date (cd20 for me!), which means I'm almost a week earlier than predicted based on lmp.

Everything below my hips hurt especially my groin, I feel like I have done 100 squats. I am also in a crabby mood because DH is leaving town this weekend coming to go to his grandparents vow renewal 7 hours away (without traffic) and he didn't want to leave me but his MIL guilt tripped him and she doesn't seem to even acknowledge how hard this is for us. Yesterday he told her this was horrible timing and he wasn't happy about it and she replied with ""Well I am not doing this for me I am doing this for me, they only get one 50th wedding anniversary"". Well who the hell is thinking about me? I only get ONE birth of our first child and I swear if I go into labour while he is gone there will be hell to pay!!  End rant. lol.

Eggs kind of gross me out too, but not to the point that I can't eat them. I force them down because apparently one should not subsist on carbs alone.  You could make a burrito with just veggies, maybe? And sub refried beans for egg? Then it would be more of a quesadilla/fajita-ish thing. But man, who knows. We're all pregnant here.

Maybe I'm just having a hormonal day but I feel like a bad Mummy, don't even know what my daughter is meant to be doing & when!  I haven't felt a proper kick for ages. A bit of pushing maybe but no real smacks or kicks. I know she's probably tired or growing but I can't even begin counting any kicks if she won't kick me!!   I'm having a diet coke to try & wake her up a bit. Lazy baby girl likes to make Mummy worried I guess...she has kicked once since I started drinking the coke! So now I feel silly for writing all that but I'm still going to leave it.  Also, no midwife or doctor has mentioned kick counts, this is all off my apps...should I even be trying to do them?!

And more than doing a count, I heard that it was more important to know your baby's movement patterns, that you know better than anyone if something is off. Like I know talk at my little guy is most active right after I've eaten or when I've drank something cold. I'm sure you're a fantastic mommy and you'll have her patterns properly figured out if you haven't already. She might also just be having a big growth spurt!"

CautiousBB,3dxldf,consciousdear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"So prior to getting pregnant, I had gotten all this paperwork switched over to a new OB/GYN doctor. (I didn't mind the one I was going to, but I was frustrated with their response to a health issue earlier in the year) So I called Thursday to inform them that I had a positive HPT and was informed to wait till my next cycle was a week late before calling back. I call today. Apparently whoever I spoke to when I first transferred my records over made a mistake because their office doesn't handle obstetrics anymore.  So now I'm back at my old doctor's--although seeing someone new since my original one doesn't handle deliveries. Which was fine. I ask to get transferred to speak to a nurse to make sure I'm doing things okay in the meanwhile before I get in for my appointment. No response. Ugh."
CautiousBB,3dw38n,Rainbow2k15,7,Mon Jul 20 00:42:01 2015 UTC,I had an early loss and still feel like you do. I'm terrified of setting things up and coming home empty handed from the hospital. Seeing her nursery finished without her in it would be too much for me. Do what feels right.
CautiousBB,3dw38n,lubbys,5,Mon Jul 20 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"Late loss too! at 39 weeks. I totally get how you feel. My nursery was already fully prepared for my first baby (which was supposed to be a little baby girl). My due date was in the summer, so I had all these little cute dresses, untagged, all washed, ready just for her.   This time I'm pregnant with a boy. My due date is in January. So as you expect, I have almost no clothes for him. I don't think I have the mental energy to go inside baby shops again. I decided I will not buy anything. If this baby makes it, I'll send my mom to the nearest shop and ask her to buy few items while I'm still in hospital.   I specifically told my friends no baby showers allowed this time around. We will celebrate when the baby is here.   I also decided not to think about baby names. I'll do that before I have to make the birth certificate. I don't want to give the baby a name and get too emotionally attached.   Some people think I'm crazy, and I'm overdoing this. But those people didn't go through what I've been through and don't understand how that loss broke me forever. So I don't really care what they think, I'll do what's best for my sanity."
CautiousBB,3dw38n,sbrib,4,Mon Jul 20 07:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm an early loss as well so although I feel the same as you - i think I feel it to a lesser degree. For me the two big humps this pregnancy were getting past where I was when I miscarried and getting past 12 weeks. Even now I still question how everything is going in there and have little panics. I don't think that will ever go until I am home with my baby. I'm guessing it's like that for you - except the goal for you is just to get home with your baby.   At the end of the day, if you don't have things set up and pretty it doesn't really matter. What matters is that you get home with a healthy baby (and a healthy you!). As long as you've got your car seat in and somewhere for baby to sleep you're on the right track. The rest will come along in time."

CautiousBB,3dw38n,tinatrying,3,Mon Jul 20 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"My loss was 22 weeks, now I'm 36 weeks. My nursery is mostly piles of stuff laying around waiting to be washed and sorted.... Idk if it ever goes away. I didn't put the crib and cloths and dresser back in there until maybe 30 weeks? Idk. Once the baby comes we'll probably do it. Some days I'm super excited and some days I am depressed and am not getting my hopes up, just in case. Even though all logic says this will be a take home baby.. I think it's a normal part of the grieving process that can be different for everyone."

My face is bigger, my feet swell, my bump starts directly under my boobs & does that amusing ""B"" shape at the Belly button. I am in no way ""glowing"" with my dry skin & spots.   Basically she looks adorable ~ I look like Quasimodo as I ever so fetchingly waddle around at work! So, yeah, I get that jealous feeling often. But meh.

Hopefully in a few more weeks I'll look pregnant and flabby instead of just flabby (I'm 4-5 weeks behind you).

I had my husbands cousin and my apparent best friend announce their pregnancies about a week after I miscarried. They are due on the same day. I have different personal issues with both these women but the big thing for me is being a ""better pregnant woman"". I want to be prettier and more pregnant looking than them. I want a nicer bump, and a cuter baby and  a nicer nursery etc. And the crazy thing - because somewhere deep in my crazy female hormone filled mind I feel like I deserve it more than them.  I have worked so f-ing hard for this. My husband and I waited and put off having children for a couple of years to make sure we had a good house, marriage, and we're financially secure.  I have gone through so much these last couple of years that it's my turn for some joy. I lost my mum, then I lost a baby, and I hated them for having such an easy time. I hated them and their pregnancies because they hadn't earned it.  Then my logical husband pointed out to me - i dont know what they've been through and they don't know what I've been through. As far as everything appears on the outside they're having a wonderful time getting pregnant by accident and everything's so great for them.   While I still hold in my mind that - i can't assume they've had an easy time getting pregnant or are having an easy pregnancy to keep me sane. I still can't get over the fact that somewhere deep inside me makes me want to be a better pregnant woman.   You you bet when I got to her baby shower in four weeks (just one of them) I'm going to make sure I look like the hottest pregnant lady there ever was - because being that kind of petty makes me feel better."
CautiousBB,3du9tg,septicidal,4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:09 2015 UTC,"Something my therapist has reminded me about is that externally, people only project the ""good"" stuff.  So all of the cute nursery pictures and flattering maternity photos, etc....  We don't see that the rest of the house/apartment may be a mess and they're puking all the time, or aside from those 2-3 angles they look just like everyone else.  I think social media makes this exceptionally difficult - everyone is posting flattering angles and pictures with filters to make everything look happy and nice, which may or may not have anything to do with reality.  It think it plays into instincts to compete with one another, too.  I've been focusing a lot on just enjoying my life as it is.  A bunch of our friends just moved from condos to single family homes... But we have a great condo with space that works well for us and (mostly) good neighbors, and we've worked hard to make our space our own.

I feel like a high schooler.   Their relationship is SHIT, him and her, I wish I could divulge but won't. I know they have not had issues yet, and I just would die if they got pregnant on first try. And of course extra die if something happened to my pregnancy while those losers stayed okay.   I know life is unfair, I completely know, but having someone in my life that I don't enjoy, someone that probably should not have a child, I would just die. Mostly, I feel like I would so be disappointing my husband, if it worked out for them but not for us, ugh. I would hate to see the look on his face seeing them and her happy and with a healthy bump and me, broken."
CautiousBB,3du9tg,autumnx,5,Mon Jul 20 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"It might not be a pretty feeling that you are feeling, but it's totally normal. I feel jealous of women who haven't had a loss because they can have ""easy"" pregnancies that aren't filled with anxiety and panic. I think that we sometimes forget that we don't always know the whole story with other people too. They may have had a loss they haven't shared or they may have ttc before with no success. Don't be down on yourself for feeling envious of others, but keep in mind that you are pregnant! That's awesome!"

Then she bought her first house right when we started looking for our first house.  It's a bit petty and jealous, but we all feel that sometimes.  Your feelings are totally valid.

But I will say that most likely the weight LOSS journey us now on hold for a bit, especially with your height/weight.   What you can do is eat well, manage your intake, keep exercising moderately, and talk to your OB about managing your weight gain. That way you go into pregnancy with a plan and you can gain a safe amount that will be easier on you when you get started after baby!"
CautiousBB,3duvce,melissarose8585,6,Sun Jul 19 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"You don't need to change your calorie intake in the first trimester. You need an extra 300 for the second, and then depending you need 500 extra in the third."
CautiousBB,3duvce,dizzyvonblue,3,Sun Jul 19 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"Second this! All the guidelines I've read actually say gaining too much wait in the first trimester (when you don't need to gain any) puts you at higher risk for gestational diabetes.  As for calorie total, that varies depending on height and weight, so it's best to ask your doctor what plan is best. Usually, doctors will tell you to just eat a healthy, balanced diet, and lay off trying to lose weight."
CautiousBB,3duvce,Qwertyz13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"I'm 8+1 today and I actually lost 5 pounds now that my bloating is less severe.

No fast food and I walked 2-5 miles 5 days a week."
CautiousBB,3duvce,dizzyvonblue,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"This is what I was told too, with the understanding that calories would be at maintenance for the trimester. Which, if we're on the same page, means OP would need to push her calories from 1500 to whatever her maintenance is."
CautiousBB,3duvce,crapeau,5,Mon Jul 20 00:33:30 2015 UTC,"The guideline my OB gave me for eating during pregnancy is that you should eat 300 calories more than you would normally need.  That being said, no OB will advise losing weight during pregnancy. Keep in mind that some of the weight, especially in the first trimester, comes from increased blood volume.  The best thing you can do is keep being active and eating healthy foods in moderation. I would advise staying away from the scale until a few weeks after birth (you can retain a LOT of fluid immediately after giving birth so you shouldn't use a weight from that time to gauge anything)."
CautiousBB,3duvce,septicidal,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:40 2015 UTC,you can retain a LOT of fluid immediately after giving birth   The fluid retention in my legs and feet the first few days was insane. I didn't have a scale at home back then to torture myself with but my postpartum weight wasn't too awful at my postpartum checkup 6-8 weeks out. Everyone's different so please don't be hard on yourself if it takes some time to get back to losing weight after your baby's born; if you'll be breastfeeding it can take a little trial and error to find the balance between what you need to eat to maintain milk supply and the amount of exercise and diet to support your fitness goals.
CautiousBB,3duvce,ubergrun,2,Sun Jul 19 22:42:13 2015 UTC,This is untrue. Some OBs will advise losing weight for women who are obese and morbidly obese.
CautiousBB,3duvce,allthecaramel,4,Sun Jul 19 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"And those OBs are wrong.  Guidelines for women who are obese are 11-22lbs gained over their base before pregnancy, though they arent as concerned with a lower weight gain.  There are some conflicting studies that show that weight loss leads to lower birth weight babies and the associated risks with that.  It is probably better than gaining too much."
CautiousBB,3duvce,Empiricalbaker,3,Mon Jul 20 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"Mine didn't. I was 77lbs down in the middle of my weight loss journey when we got our BFP. My OB put that immediately to a stop, even though I am still in morbidly obese range. She advocated that it is much more important to worry about nutrition than calories. I had been on a 1700/day calorie diet to lose weight and she bumped me up  to 2000 a day.   I would listen to the OB's direction. Losing weight isn't  your goal during pregnancy, your goal is to grow a healthy baby."
CautiousBB,3duvce,ReigningPotatoes,2,Mon Jul 20 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"The minimum calorie intake is about 300-500 above total daily energy expense (TDEE). However, you can get away with TDEE during the first trimester."
CautiousBB,3duvce,greentea1985,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"Focus on nutrition and getting good foods in.  Proteins, health fats, lots of vegetables, etc.  There are some studies that show that women who lost weight before pregnancy may gain more than expected during (rebound weight gain along with pregnancy stuff.)  There also may be issues with nutrients (women losing weight may not be getting as many nutrients as we could use), so start with a prenatal if you havent already :)  My weight was mostly stable before getting pregnant, and I lost weight during the first trimester due to hyperemesis Gravidarum.  The projected weight gain is based on your pre-pregnancy weight.  Dont fear getting fat :)"
CautiousBB,3duvce,Empiricalbaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"When I found out I was pregnant, I was about 60 lbs down (still tons more to go).  I was eating around 1500-1800 calories depending on my activity for that day (I was marathon training).  I didn't change my eating really until about a week or so ago.  I have never been so hungry in my entire life as I have been since hitting week 12.  I didn't have really bad morning sickness and maintained my weight the first trimester.  But I've been out of control hungry since then.  Not to freak you out or anything with my anec-data, but I've seriously woken up in the middle of night this past week about every other night just because I was too hungry to sleep anymore.  I've decided to stop counting calories because it drove me absolutely batty one day when I got to my old calorie limits and it was only 3 pm.  And I was absolutely ravenous  I'm terrified about gaining weight because I'm still pretty heavy (~270).  But I also acknowledge that I can't sit here starving either.  I've got a well stocked house with nutritious food/snacks (seriously want to eat all the fruit).  I'm putting good stuff in, but just more than I used to.  I think part of the hunger is that I am officially allowed to do activity again (small subchorionic hematoma and huge ovarian cyst for the first several weeks).  I've added back in daily walking, swimming and my more vigorous vinyasa yoga classes.  I'm going in next week for an ultrasound to see if I can start running again.  I really really miss it.    Sorry to hijack your post! I wanted to kind of share with you this part so maybe you won't be as distraught as I was when the hunger thing happened. But, I'm here with you with a pregnancy in the middle of weight loss!  It's hard to wrap my brain around food in the same way.  Especially with the new demanding hunger thing.  If I don't eat, I start getting nauseated and crazy heartburn."

CautiousBB,3duvce,crapeau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of people have chimed in, but I was in virtually the same boat as you so I wanted to say hello! I kept exercising as much as I could, when I felt not-too-sick to do it. I also upped my calories to about 1800 a day while still logging. Don't do low-fat foods to stay calorie restricted though, baby needs lots of protein, fats, and vegetable micronutrients to help build that developing nervous system.   You're not going to be given the ok to lose weight, but if you can maintain weight through the first trimester (instead of gaining overall) you will be set up for success. I gained about 6 lbs by 8 weeks, then dropped it all at 10weeks because it was all just bloat, so spend more time looking at your diet log than you do the scale."
CautiousBB,3duvce,crapeau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Heaps of good advice here, but the more, the merrier, right?  I would focus on maintaining your weight through the first trimester. I don't think any doctor is going to give you the green light to keep losing, especially as you're pretty much in your healthy weight range now.   If hearing what other people are doing helps, here's my story. I'm much shorter than you (5'2""!) and tend to sit near the top of my healthy weight range (BMI around 23-24). When I got pregnant I was eating around 1600-1700 calories a day and had already figured out that my maintenance was around 1850. I weighed in at 58.6kg (129 lbs) when I found out I was knocked up.  I've since set myself a goal of 1900 calories a day and even on reduced activity, I maintain on this. I'm not suffering from nausea, but my appetite is definitely not what it used to be (which is WEIRD for me, I'm usually the hungriest person in the world), so sometimes I only manage to come in at 1600-1700 calories. I've lost about a lb from my pre-pregnancy weight which I'm trying to make back up.  Anyway, my point is, you're taller and younger than me, so if I maintain on 1900 calories a day, there is no way that 1500 a day is enough for you - especially if you're maintaining your activity levels. Do your baby a solid and work out your maintenance and aim for that. You might be surprised at how much you have to eat to maintain your weight, especially if it's all coming from good, healthy foods!   Sorry if I sound bossy ... But I stand by it. You've done brilliantly to get to where you are and now you've got all the tools to eat well and exercise throughout your pregnancy, and to get the baby weight off afterwards. You might not have much to take off afterwards anyway! But please don't worry about losing weight now. Maintenance is where it's at :)"

As for the bleeding, I'm definitely no doctor but my first thought was that your poor cervix got irritated. Everything is in such close quarters in there that I'm guessing it could easily have irritated what was already a very sensitive area. I really hope the doc calls you back soon. Best of luck!"

I had a CP in April, so of course I'm pretty nervous about this now. I have a blood test set for tomorrow and I'm hoping the HCG is at a good level.

FF said I o'd 1st on June 20th but then it changed to July 4 so I have no idea. One of my biggest concerns is I have a low thyroid issues and have been on synthroid to treat it. Last time my TSH was checked was back in March where it wasn't where we wanted it to be (3.37) so my dose was doubled. I'm super hoping a big difference was made for pregnancy reasons.

I had a few minor symptoms in late June and some very light bleeding July 1, which I assume was implantation.   Three stick tests have said yes, as did a blood test, which dated me a week behind what I thought (HCI levels were 4-5 weeks, counting backwards from period I should have been 6w3d).   I went for an ultrasound at 6w4d and wasn't told a thing throughout, and then finally just ""it's too early to see baby, your doctor will call you.""   There was a big sign on the wall that said ""I cannot tell you anything, ask your doctor"" so I didn't prod, though I sure wanted to. She was measuring something!

Maggie came home and we were adjusting perfectly to having two new family members at home.....until Friday. The doctor called and gave us yet another piece of news that literally ripped the rug out from under us. Both of my babies failed their newborn screening for something called SCID. They were tested a week apart and thus, the doctor thinks it's unlikely it's a false positive. We are not to have guests nor take them from the home. He ordered me to stop breast feeding. We are to watch them for any sign of a runny nose or rash and take them immediately to the hospital but we are to have someone warn the hospital staff first so they are quarantined. We had them retested Friday afternoon for confirmation. We thought we were in the clear FINALLY. We can't believe this is happening but we are fairly calm after freaking out the first day."

I'm also suffering from a shortened patience- hard because I work with actual toddlers. :p  I'm so jealous that your maternity leave starts so soon- my boss and I had originally planned that I stop work at the beginning of September, but now it's looking closer the end of September, when I'll be 36/37 weeks. I'm a nanny and have to carry a chunky monkey up and down stairs... I don't know how it'll go when I'm that pregnant!"
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,TheFinalFrontier47,3,Sun Jul 19 16:10:59 2015 UTC,"22 weeks today! Only 2 weeks until viability. I've been feeling Miss Hazel all over the place - she finally moved up out of my pelvis area some this week, where she seemed to have taken up permanent residence, haha. I've been feeling her kicks and rolls all over my belly now, which is awesome. She even kicked hard enough one day that I saw my belly move! Best of all, my husband finally felt her kick last night - she likes to be a troll and stop moving as soon as he touches my belly, but she gave him a good smack last night :). It's so cool feeling her move, makes this all seem more real. I'm feeling pretty queasy today for some reason, but hopefully it'll pass. Also discovered that one of my favorite pre-preg dresses is very close to not fitting right anymore - it's flowy with an empire waist so I thought I could wear it for awhile. Apparently not, haha. Going to have birthday lunch for my FIL later, hopefully it'll cure my queasiness :). Have a lovely day, ladies!"
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,Notsimpleenough,2,Sun Jul 19 16:22:38 2015 UTC,I am currently 7w1d. I was just recently in the E.R. due to pretty severe pain on my left side. Found out I have several cysts on my left ovary. So that stinks. I have my first prenatal and ultrasound appointment on Tuesday. I'm excited but nervous. I'm hoping I will get to hear or at least see the heartbeat to calm some of my fears about baby not having one.
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,Semirelatednonsense,2,Sun Jul 19 13:58:53 2015 UTC,6 weeks tomorrow. All day sickness has set in. Just spent an hour bawling like a baby on the couch telling my husband he hates me. I'm being a total complete bitch. I apologized. But I have to quit acting like that completely. I just feel freaking helpless and pathetic right now and it's very much making me feel isolated from him to some degree. I know it's painful for him to watch and be able to do nothing. I need to start being more aware of his feelings and not just mine. I just hope we get through this rough shit without choking each other.
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,justcurious12345,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"It hit for me right around 6 weeks.  I'm 8.5 wks today and starting to feel better.  I've lost 8 lbs without puking!

CautiousBB,3dtqe3,Tinyprogeny,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:35 2015 UTC,"26+5. Still pregnant!  Lots of nesting this weekend- yesterday I inexplicably felt the overwhelming desire to detail clean our bathroom- I used a toothbrush. It was bizarre. I also reorganized our closet, the kitchen cabinets and refolded all of the baby stuff.   We've bought a lot of stuff that we will need- getting down to just the boring stuff. We decided not to have a baby shower (because space- we live in a studio!) so we've been slowly buying stuff as it has been on sale. I also did a big ikea order this weekend for our new bed frame with under bed storage and lots of other little things.   My mom comes to visit the second week of August and we will be moving furniture around the week after that. Phew!   I'm feeling fine- some pain at night if I roll away from my belly propping blankets. I had two elevated fasting numbers this week (GD), so I'm hoping they'll let me increase metformin to see if it helps before moving to insulin.   I also had one high post meal number but it was a really dumb meal- white rice and no protein- so I'm not too concerned about it. Either way I've been testing every meal since then to make sure it was a one off.  That was long!"
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"I had one spree of nesting a few weeks ago, where I deep deep cleaned our master bedroom. Everything from the ceiling to wiping down the walls to scrubbing the baseboards. I never clean baseboards. It was really satisfying though, and I'm betting you're feeling great having your home clean and organized!"
CautiousBB,3dtqe3,jessercas,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm currently 39+1.  I've kinda retreated lately and haven't been posting. Last Wednesday, at my weekly check in, we discovered that our little dude had flipped breech. He's been head down for weeks so we were surprised. We had been planning a natural birth. I have been working my tail off for months making sure to monitor my weight so he wasn't too big (we have family history of giant babies) and had already submitted my natural birth plan to my doctor. Everything looked good to go.  Well now that he's breech we've had to switch gears. I'm scheduled Tuesday for an ECV to try and turn him in hopes that I can avoid a c-section but if it doesn't work I go straight in for one.  I know it could be sooooooo much worse but I've been feeling bummed having gone from ""everything is actually looking normal and your going to be good"" to ""yeah he's breech and we're going to have to intervene"".  It's been tough changing gears."

CautiousBB,3dtqe3,lancealittle,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm 33 weeks now, and yesterday I had my first (and ONLY, I hope) ""pregnancy is for the birds"" day. My back was so incredibly painful I couldn't walk upright all day, and I had to work a 12-hour shift. In addition, my symphysis pubis pain kicked into high gear for the second half of the day and my belly kept getting in the way of examining/taking care of patients. Feeling much better today, thankfully. This week we tour the NICU and get to see the brand new L&D wing at the hospital where we are delivering."

CautiousBB,3dr7i9,fattymcflurry,5,Sat Jul 18 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"From what I understand and was told by my OB, your numbers look great. As long as they double or at least increase by 60% in 48 hours, you are in the clear. Once the Hcg is high(I guess in 1200 to 6000 mIU/ml) the doubling time slows to 72 hours.   You can try a hcg doubling calculator like this . Just to ease your worries. When I put in your numbers they all said doubling time was 1.2-1.3 days, which is awesome!! Good luck..."
CautiousBB,3dr7i9,auntluv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yup -- no worries as long as the doubling time is under 72 hours. And it will fluctuate, especially if you're not getting the draws at the exact same time each day. After you had 3 good ones, why are they still ordering more? Do you have an US scheduled?"
CautiousBB,3dr7i9,lancealittle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:05:19 2015 UTC,No ultrasound yet. I had a miscarriage last month so just wanted to make sure they got higher. My doc hasn't seen any of the results yet as she is away.
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,palmtree23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:56:22 2015 UTC,Ugh girl I hear Ya. I had some random bleeding at 7 weeks and have been put on pelvic rest until 13 weeks. Two weeks to go!
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,Scandinavel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:56:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no, that's the worst! I hope the remaining two weeks fly by."
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,autumnx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not posting this to scare you, but to give my experience in case you experience the same thing.  At 10 weeks, I got a pap smear done by the OB. My pregnancy was very high risk so I went from an RE (weeks 4-10), then an OB, then also seen a MFM at a perinatal center. During the pap smear, I did bleed a bit but it was brown and they said that was expected. Around 12 weeks, I got up to use the bathroom and there was a gush of blood. A lot of it. Bright red. I went to the ER and got a bunch of tests done. They said I had a threatened miscarriage and to go home to take it easy. I spotted for a month. It was horrible.   Long story short, I went to the MFM and he said unless cervical cancer is very prevalent in your family, pap smears are not required or recommended during pregnancy. It's acceptable to skip them.   It was stress and anxiety for nothing. If you do experience any more bleeding, I would assume that's why and don't stress out about it. Just make sure to bring it up with your doctor or any specialist you see that you got a pap smear done. That way they'll know."
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"I'm turning mine down. I had one last October at my regular family doctor. There is no need for anyone to be scraping anything off and or out of my pregnant cervix.   I am so sorry you went through that. That's traumatizing.  I think doctors try and get in as many procedures as possible. When I was miscarrying they made me do a urine test, then a blood test, then put a fucking cath in and did a pregnancy test that way as well. Then an ultrasound. While I already had the pregnancy doctor confirmed. They could have skipped to the ultrasound."
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't had one in a year and I'm really nervous my doctor is going to want to do one when I go in next week. I've had one abnormal pap 3 years ago, and a coloscopy that came back normal afterwards. Bleh. Doing one and NOT doing one both make me equally nervous."
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:09:13 2015 UTC,If I'd ever had an abnormal one I'm sure my tune would be totally different.
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,autumnx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you sharing this! I'm seeing MFM on Wednesday for the NT scan, so I definitely plan to at least mention the issue there. And now that you mention Pap smears aren't really required or recommended during pregnancy, it makes me somewhat annoyed with my OB. Messing around with a pregnant cervix seems iffy at best, and I have no history that would indicate it's a good idea. Ugh. Well, thank you!! I'm glad your situation worked out okay, despite lots of unnecessary stress."
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely mention it. When I had mine, I was very nervous but trusted my doctor. He kept saying that cervical cancer is dangerous and I wouldn't want that. Obviously. However, the pregnant cervix is way more sensitive. And I don't know if there's any correlation but my cervix became very short during my second and third trimesters. It made me mad thinking ""high risk pregnancy, let's do a pap smear!"""
CautiousBB,3dpzcp,sbrib,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"The OB did a pap at my first appointment as well. I thought it was weird, because it had only been 6 months since my last one. But it was at a new practice for me, and I guess they just wanted to do their own. I definitely spotted heavily for a few days afterward, but everything ended up being fine. I see the midwives site of my practice now and I like them a lot more than the OB.  Best of luck on the NT next week! Glad you were able to see your little bean."
CautiousBB,3dp4pq,maddiecoleman,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"I'd reckon it will be slower than you expect.  You're six weeks and some change, yes?  Radiopaedia says ~110bpm around 6 weeks.  This PubMed article says by 7 weeks it should have risen to 120bpm.  The 130-160 bpm figure is for later in pregnancy.  I'm even seeing some cites for as low as 90 bpm; the second linked article seems to consider 90 bpm the floor of normal for early pregnancy.  So don't be surprised or worried if it's only like 110 or so."
CautiousBB,3dp4pq,Grave_Girl,2,Sat Jul 18 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"I know at just past 6 weeks ours was 118, so definitely lower at this stage (20 weeks today)."

CautiousBB,3donip,tinatrying,10,Sat Jul 18 00:03:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your loss. People are always talking about how they have to get to 8 weeks, 12 weeks, or 24 weeks but really the truth is there is no safe time.   <trigger:sad>  I was reading on here about a woman whose best friend had lost her son in a car wreck at 18 yrs old and another woman who's baby died from meningitis at 3 months. It's all sad, your can't be safe from everything forever.   Every time I hear about someone's loss I think I have to be thankful for the days I have and take every day on its own. It can be overwhelming especially when you start thinking that anything could happen, you are so brave for trying again and you have to proud of yourself.   So remember to be brave and if logic helps your odds are very good for this baby and all your doctors are watching you. This baby will be such a blessing when it gets here.   Hope that helps and it's not too sad."
CautiousBB,3donip,notantisocial,7,Sat Jul 18 02:08:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, I am so sorry about your loss. I have only had early losses and those were difficult. I can't imagine what you've been through.   Secondly, congratulations on your pregnancy! I'm at 8w3d so we are basically due date buddies!   I can understand why you would be paranoid through this whole pregnancy. Have you been to /r/ttcafterloss? They have an alumni thread for people who have successfully conceived after a loss and the ladies (and gents) are amazing. I know there are some people in there who have been through a similar situation as you and are currently expecting. If you haven't been there yet, I can't recommend it enough."

I'm 8w5d today and had an ultrasound that went really well, so as I do, I'll probably feel good for around 3 days and start panicking again by the end of the week.  lol.  As to TTCafterloss, thank you for sending me over there.  I thought it was only for those trying, and that the Alumni was for those with babies (not for those betweeners like me who are currently pregnant).  Only after your post did I realize that ""alumni"" was merely those who were actually pregnant, and I've gotten a lot out of reading posts over there.  Thanks so much for the tip!"
CautiousBB,3donip,sbrib,4,Mon Jul 20 19:15:50 2015 UTC,"First I'm very sorry about your loss. Second I know exactly what you re going through since I went through exactly the same thing.    I lost my daughter at 39 weeks.  Placental abruption which lead to baby losing a lot of blood.  I had to undergo emergency C section.    Fast forward 6 months I'm pregnant again.  I ignored my Dr recommendation for waiting a year and was able to convince him that my sanity won't wait 12 months.    Now baby 2 on the way.  I'm 13 weeks and we got to know it's a boy.  When the technician told me the gender I cried like someone had died.  I wanted a baby girl because that's what I was supposed to have the first time.  I cried the whole day until I came to realize that what I'm doing is not fair to this current baby or to my angel baby.  I shouldn't be bearing a replacement but a brother to my little baby girl.  I told my bump that I'm sorry for acting so selfishly and I DECIDED that I'll try my best to enjoy this pregnancy.  First because stress is not good for baby.  Second because when I look back at this pregnancy I want to look at it with same happiness and excitement as first one.  I owe it to our little baby boy.    Some days are harder than others to be honest.  Especially since I'm having problems of all sort and because I have higher risk of placental abruption and risk of uterine rupture if contractions start before my scheduled c section at 37 weeks.    But then there isn't really anything we can do expect hope for the best.  Take your prenatals ,go to your Dr, take it easy. I have been referred to one of the most known Doctors in high risk pregnancies and he told me that sometimes stillbirth happens as a nature fluke and noone will be able to give you answers on why and how to prevent it.  Quoting : Just relax enjoy your pregnancy and hope for the best.   Wishing you a boring uneventful pregnancy.  And hopefully next year we will both be holding our little rainbows. Feel free to pm me for some one to one chat !"
CautiousBB,3donip,sbrib,2,Sat Jul 18 06:52:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry for your loss as well.  To be honest, I'm afraid of finding out gender because I really don't know how I'll feel.  Sometimes I think finding out it's a boy will be easier, because then I'll have another difference between this pregnancy and the last, and all those differences are currently giving me hope... but then I think how much harder it will be exactly for the reasons you said... that I was ""supposed"" to have a daughter.  We are getting cfDNA done in a few weeks, so I'll know gender early like you do, so fingers crossed I can decide to be strong like you have.  A (non-alcoholic) toast to you hitting 37 weeks in stride and me hitting 38 without issue as well."

I was reading a quick article by Tamera (or Tia) Mowry and she said that she puts coconut oil all over to help prevent them. I just so happen to be using coconut oil to fight the itchiness on my belly and boobs. I am focusing more on my previous stretch mark area with the oil now in hopes it is some miracle and I don't get any (although I'm pretty sure I am starting to get one). I'm definitely going to check back to see other suggestions!"

CautiousBB,3dob52,sucumber,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:50:25 2015 UTC,My idea I have about stretch marks is there is nothing you can do to stop them from happening. But once you get them you can slather up to help the itching and scarring. I didn't have any until about 30 weeks with my first. After that they just exploded. The marks are finally silvery scars but I'm pregnant with number two now. Not sure if they will be as bad this time but I've been slathering on the cocoa butter since I got my positive!

CautiousBB,3dmzfs,jwad1246,4,Fri Jul 17 16:14:50 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, okay, so I'm 5 weeks tomorrow, but I actually demanded that my doctor husband confirm my understanding of this, too.  Let's see if I can explain this with my weak medical knowledge. The moment your egg is fertilized it starts multiplying its cells. It keeps growing no matter when it implants. Early implantation just means your egg attached early, and nothing else. It's still growing at the same rate it would have if you implanted at 9 DPO. It's more important to know when you ovulated.  I'm frustrated with my EDD because I know I ovulated two days later than my LMP would claim, but since it's only two days, my husband said they'll still probably date me from my LMP and won't believe my temping data as ovulation. Annoying doctors.  I say pick either your LMP or conception date for your EDD and then wait to see what the doctor ends up deciding your EDD is."
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,Qwertyz13,2,Fri Jul 17 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm sorry. I ovulated on July 4th, got my BFP 7DPO on 7/11.   What would you think my embroyo stage is?"
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,Qwertyz13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"Using a calculator, you're probably 3 weeks 6 days, EDD: 3/26/16.  Also, I thought of this. Depending on your app, sometimes it's showing the week you've already completed, so it's a little off. I set one of my apps to show me the current week I'm on. It might make better sense for you to think of yourself as in the middle of week 4.  Hope that helps!"
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,Qwertyz13,2,Fri Jul 17 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm asking. So even though I'm 3w6d, my little embryo has evolved as far as middle of week 4? Truly?"

CautiousBB,3dmzfs,Qwertyz13,2,Sat Jul 18 01:56:44 2015 UTC,I did the same.  I know when I ovulated (2 days later than usual) so I just adjusted my LMP by 2 days.  At my first ultrasound I was measuring exactly on with my fake LMP!
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,Luca_overthemoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:31 2015 UTC,"But, doesn't HCG not show up until it implants?   So if I implanted and got my BFP on 7DPO, and another girl with same conception and O date as me tested daily until getting her BFP at 14DPO, didn't mine implant a full week before hers did?"
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,FluffykinsDontCare,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It would depend on how sensitive the tests were, if she even tested earlier, and lots of other things that are different from woman to woman.   However, your due dates would still be the same if conception was the same day."
CautiousBB,3dmzfs,FluffykinsDontCare,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"It takes an average of 6-12 days for your fertilized embryo to implant, so if it implanted at 5DPO, you would have enough hCG to get a positive at 7DPO - if your ovulation date is in fact correct. Unless you're using OPK's, your ovulation can be earlier (or later for ladies who got a late positive test). Also remember that there are TWO LH surges, so in order to pinpoint ovulation, you'll need to start using OPK's from the last day of your menstrual bleed until you get a positive test.   Suggesting you're at 14DPO, on a 28 day cycle that's exactly 4 weeks from LMP.   Go by your LMP until you have an early dating scan. Embryos grow at the same rate of 1mm a day after 66 weeks so the measurements taken at the first ultrasound are the most accurate."

CautiousBB,3dmzfs,FluffykinsDontCare,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Ok I had this exact confusion. This is what I figured out: according to the helpful link in the sidebar (""how to count the weeks of pregnancy""), the ""first week"" of your ""pregnancy"" is really the week of AF, so you're extremely not pregnant that week and, until the 7th day of that week, it's considered ""week 0"". This was confusing to me before I understood that, because I was thinking that the 7th day of the first week would be the start of week 2, and thus... ""2w0d"", then the next day would be ""2w1d"". However, that's not the case. The seventh day of that first week is ""1w0d"", and the 8th day is ""1w1d"". So your 3rd week of pregnancy is ""2 weeks, x days"", your 4th is ""3 weeks, x days"", etc. Still with me? (I'm not very good at explaining!!). The pregnancy apps use this correct calculation to predict your due date and tell you where you are in your pregnancy, HOWEVER... They seem to display the corresponding ""your baby"" and ""your body"" information incorrectly - for me, when I was 3w 5d, that meant I was truly in my 4th week of pregnancy, but the app was saying ""oh 3w5d? That means you're in youre 3rd week of pregnancy!"" Which is not correct. It was telling me I wouldn't have possibly had a positive test yet (I had 4 by that time), and that I wouldn't miss my period until the next week, etc etc. I was so freaking confused until I realized what was going on. Still with me again?? Good!! So what I ended up doing was lying to my pregnancy apps and saying my LMP was the week before it actually happened. That way it shows me the correct information for, for example, what is happening during the 5th week of pregnancy, which is where I'm at now, even though my true gestational age is ""4 weeks, 1 day"". Edit: I realized from your responses to other ppl's answers that I might have misunderstood the question, but I'm still going to leave this wall-o-text post up in case it's helpful to you."

CautiousBB,3dme4s,maddiecoleman,5,Fri Jul 17 13:19:38 2015 UTC,"Pregnancy is a stressful time.  Yes, it's normal to maybe feel a bit more emotional.  But if you are feeling very distressed, anxious, or depressed, please talk to your OB.  Some women experience prenatal depression and/or anxiety as a result of hormonal changes affecting brain chemistry.  It also may be helpful to find someone you can talk to comfortably about your pregnancy and plans for the baby, like a therapist or counselor.  Most OBs can refer patients to someone who is used to dealing with pregnant women and the issues surrounding pregnancy.  That being said, maybe you would feel better if you were just honest with your mother.  It's fine if you're not ready to - obviously, you know your mother better than a stranger on the internet - but hiding the pregnancy from her is likely increasing your feeling of isolation.  Pregnancy is a time when you need as much support as possible, and by not giving people the opportunity to support you, you may be missing out.  People may surprise you.  If you don't feel comfortable telling your mother, is there a good friend that you trust and feel you could confide in?  That might help."
CautiousBB,3dme4s,septicidal,3,Fri Jul 17 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"Pregnancy is huge news and it's very normal to experience all kinds of emotions. Especially when you think about the hormones adding to all of this! Miscarriage nightmares are sadly also quite common, both for people that have experienced it and those who have not. Even though my pregnancy was very planned it didn't stop the emotions coming. You didn't say if yours was planned or not but I can imagine unplanned can throw in some other types of thoughts and emotions as well.  You are definitely not alone! And first tri is often quite isolating. If you don't feel comfortable sharing with people just yet this place here is a great way to connect with other people anonymously (sorry I have no idea how to spell that word) and hopefully get the support you need :)"

Really the whole first trimester is the worst: you feel terrible, your hormones are all over the place and it's scary telling people. I didn't tell my mom until 11 weeks. She is excited, but I think she's also weirded out to be grandma in her 40's.  There's really no normal. I was already in therapy, so I kept going for the first 10 weeks because being pregnant is one of the most emotionally and physically exhausting experiences I've been through and I needed support. My husband didn't want to talk about the baby in case we lost it and I wasn't ready to tell my family or friends in case I miscarried. My therapist was a safe person who could also help me separate out my reasonable anxieties and fears from the irrational ones, and coach me on coping techniques. 10/10 would do it again."

And I've been informed they will just turn into nightmares of something happening to your baby once it's born. It's better to deal with these feelings now and learn how to cope with your fears. It really helps to have someone to support you. Do you have any friends (aside from us here) that you could talk to?  It's one thing to be emotional in the first trimester, it's another to be overwhelmed by it. If you don't think your mom will be supportive, I hope you can find someone who will be. I know I've had a few emotional episodes and I'm glad I decided to go crazy and tell my immediate family about the baby. It's helped so much.  Hang in there!"

I also decided to start taking vitamin b6 because the nausea was just getting to be too much. I don't have an appointment until Tuesday in which I'll discuss a diclegis prescription or otherwise what dosage to take in general. I thiiiink I am feeling better but it's hard to tell so far because it normally comes in waves! But I'm trying to be optimistic because I can't do 6+ more weeks of this!

If all good at our ultrasound on Tuesday I think I can survive until the 2nd tri starts.  I printed the chart and highlighted the days as they went by.

I'm 7w1d and I'd say my symptoms have picked up in the past few days but still aren't super bothersome. My boob soreness isn't severe compared to some pre-period boob soreness and comes and goes. My nausea has started to ramp up a bit but I've been learning ways to lessen its effects. Beyond that, I'm not really having any symptoms besides uterine stretching. Hang in there and know that you're not alone!"

CautiousBB,3djxmy,La_plant,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"You know that show ""I Didn't Know I was Pregnant""?  It exists because some people really don't have symptoms!    In seriousness, I am with you because I've had two losses and never have a lot of symptoms.  I would definitely welcome some nausea if it meant everything was okay in there. But in reality some people have all the symptoms and still miscarry.  It doesn't guarantee anything.  So I guess we should just try to be grateful that we feel okay for now.  P.S. You don't have NO symptoms if you are having indigestion and bloating. Those are symptoms! embrace them! ;)"

And I was tired and lazy (possibly not related to the pregnancy) That's it. Completely normal not to have symptoms, or to not have many, it is no indication of how the pregnancy is going :)"
CautiousBB,3djxmy,HazMat68W,2,Fri Jul 17 10:59:07 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but this makes me feel a lot better. Week 5-6 I was feeling nausea, super fatigue, sore breasts....the works. Week 7 (and first ultrasound monday) and all I feel it uterine stretching and by boobs are a little sore when poked. It's making me uneasy but hopefully that's just me being paranoid."
CautiousBB,3djxmy,autumnx,2,Fri Jul 17 13:23:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   The only symptom I have other than gas/bloating is peeing a lot. But I think peeing too much is a really deceptive symptom. I'm supposed to be drinking at least eight hours of water per day, which I am, so naturally I would pee more - pregnant or not. Am I wrong?  Also, have any of you been taking prometrium (progesterone) as added protection? I've been using it for several days now and am noticing a brown discharge occasionally which is starting to freak me out BIG TIME. Called my doctor and it's hopefully nothing, but we will see next week. I've never had a more positive outlook my entire life."
CautiousBB,3djxmy,brycedoula,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"I had 3 miscarriages before having my daughter. With her, I was on 200mg of prometrium oral and baby aspirin as I tested positive for Factor V Leiden, a blood clotting disorder. They weren't sure that's what caused my losses as normally FVL carriers have losses later (not first tri) but they wanted to be cautious and that was fine with me.  Not having symptoms, especially so early, are not indicative of a miscarriage. Just like having symptoms is not indicative of having a healthy pregnancy. With my daughter, I didn't have any symptoms until I was 9 weeks. With my previous miscarriages, I had every symptom at 4 weeks.   It's going to be a long, long pregnancy for you if you obsess over your symptoms. It's hard to do but you just have to let it go. Speak to your doctor if you are having continual cramping that gets worse. Some cramping is very normal."
CautiousBB,3djxmy,Grkgdss00,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:53:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I didn't even feel pregnant until at least 6+3 - and that's when the nausea hit. Whee! Up until then, I only had burping, slight tiredness, a slight...um...GI slowdown and tender breasts. But I probably only noticed because I was paying extra close attention. If we hadn't been TTC, or if I'd been super busy with life and not paying attention? Meh, may not have noticed at all. Take it day by day for now, and in a few days you may be waking up to barfing your guts out!"
CautiousBB,3dju6f,greeneyedlife,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"The exercises could have made it come back again. When you're active, anything that's left can get shaken loose. I would take it easy until you're seen by your OB or the blood resolves. Bleeding can be normal. I bled with my daughter. However, clots are not so something is going on. That doesn't mean it's a miscarriage but could be a SCH. Is the blood pink or orange? Or just dark?"
CautiousBB,3dju6f,autumnx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes sense, and I hope that's exactly what happened.  It has been only dark, so that is hopeful."
CautiousBB,3dju6f,Grave_Girl,2,Fri Jul 17 11:10:43 2015 UTC,"I hope you hear back from your doctor soon.  These things are so scary, and it's hard to give a good answer.  It is probably not a big deal.  I've been told that brown blood is usually old blood and so not particularly worrisome; I'd guess (though I don't know for sure) you probably just dislodged it with your exercise.  If it's reassuring for you at all, I had brown bleeding for like three weeks when I was pregnant with my son.  It's scary!"
CautiousBB,3dju6f,Vak0915,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:54 2015 UTC,"I'm 7 1/2 weeks. Started bleeding/spotting at 6 weeks. Went in to the ER and they did an ultrasound. I thought for sure I was miscarrying. BUT we saw the baby's heartbeat and the doctor pointed out a spot near my cervix that was where the bleeding was coming from and that so far, baby was fine. I've passed a couple clots. Some red but mostly brown. Unless you're soaking through a pad in an hour, try to not freak out. It's hard I know, but stress will make it worse. I also find that when I stand or walk around for long periods of time, the bleeding gets worse. Take it easy and drink lots of water."
CautiousBB,3dj615,TheFinalFrontier47,3,Thu Jul 16 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"Ask your doctor for a prescription. I got a good one with a lower belly band, back band, and across the top of my belly band for an 18 dollar copay. Instead of a 50 dollar one that didn't feel great from the store."

CautiousBB,3dj615,singwejoyous,3,Thu Jul 16 19:44:44 2015 UTC,I would second the suggestion to ask your doc. I know a lot of people on here swear by them but when I brought them up with my OB/physical therapist/chiropractor they all said support belts are a last ditch effort. They worried about my muscles getting dependent on them.   It sounds like you're just looking for a little of support but I thought I'd throw out what I'd heard.   Hope you get some relief!
CautiousBB,3dj615,tinameri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's good to know. Did they give you any suggestions of what you could do in place of using a band/belt? You're right, I am just looking for a bit of support, so if there's an alternative to a band/belt, I'm open to it - a band/belt is just the first thing I thought of."
CautiousBB,3dj615,singwejoyous,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:08 2015 UTC,I've been doing physical therapy to help strengthen pelvis muscles and ab muscles. I can only do pool stuff but it's been great. I also had some pre-existing hip problems so it's possible it was just me!  Luckily we met our deductible and I'm off for the summer so PT is free and I'm able to get in twice a week.
CautiousBB,3dj615,tinameri,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"That's fantastic! I'm glad you're able to get the help you need. Yeah, I suspect my pain is just due to the area about my section scar stretching, but certainly wouldn't hurt to check with the OB."
CautiousBB,3dj615,autumnx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:15:30 2015 UTC,My ob actually recommended getting a band/belt for support.  I guess it varies.

CautiousBB,3dj507,Wolf_Lady,3,Thu Jul 16 18:38:43 2015 UTC,Good to know; I will definitely request a different color. I don't know why they wouldn't go with green or blue --- drug-makers are idiots!

The yellow ones are just as bad, they keep making me think I have an infection and then I'm like nope, prometrium!  Stupid pills.  Just as a heads up, some people get really itchy from them (myself included). I'm currently using hydrocortisone cream to help the itch, and additionally, wash off quite well in the mornings (assuming you're using them before you go to bed) and that should help."

CautiousBB,3dicrn,FluffykinsDontCare,4,Thu Jul 16 14:44:42 2015 UTC,"I would go on ahead and call. Some clinics (like mine) won't see you until you're 8 weeks, and I was also informed they actually prefer the transvaginal US around that time because it helps them date the pregnancy better. But this is just how my clinic does things. I would call and ask yours for a more specific answer."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,Qwertyz13,3,Thu Jul 16 14:50:43 2015 UTC,I would call your doctor since every clinic is different.  My 1st one was at 7w3d and they used the transvaginal to check on baby and date the pregnancy to match with my last period I recorded.  Most clinics will wait till you are between 8-12 weeks but I had previous losses so my doctor wanted to see me when she knew she could see a sac and heartbeat.  Congrats and good luck!
CautiousBB,3dicrn,in2thewoods,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"My OB office did my first ultrasound transvaginally at 7 weeks.  I didn't return for 5 more weeks, but I got the abdominal one then, at 12 weeks."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,rcrumbsinmybed,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"What's your history? If this is your first pregnancy, no losses, they'll just do a pregnancy test and blood draw to check your HCG. Most places don't give you an ultrasound until 9 weeks. It does depend on the office. I went to a RE because I was high risk so I got a trans-vaginal ultrasound every week until 10 weeks. Around 12 weeks, they did it on my stomach."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,autumnx,2,Thu Jul 16 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"If you're sure of your dates then you may reasonably decline the TV ultrasound. They're not exactly the most dignified thing in the whole world, and kind of uncomfortable, so unless you're desperate on seeing a little blob...Talk to your OB, see what he/she says."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,brycedoula,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:48:08 2015 UTC,When I had my early ultraounds they were able to see without a wand at 9 weeks but used the wand at 12 weeks for a better view.
CautiousBB,3dicrn,epiclady,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"I've had 1 CP (lost it before I even got an appointment).  For my current pregnancy, I had my first appointment at 9 weeks.  At that appointment there was no ultrasound or tests other than blood pressure maybe.  I scheduled my first bloodwork and U/S (NT screening) for 12 weeks.  If you have complications or were seeing a fertility specialist or if it is standard where you live, you might have an early ultrasound or a dating ultrasound.  Around here (Ontario, Canada) the only standard ultrasound is around 20 weeks, with the optional NT scan at 12 weeks."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,Shortkaik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"Im in Canada so not sure if it's different.   I went in at 4 weeks to confirm pregnancy (just a pee test). Then he gave me all my US requests and told me to go in around 7/8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18-20 Weeks.  My 7 week was basically just to confirm a viable pregnancy (we had just begun fertility testing) and was done externally."
CautiousBB,3dicrn,CollectionOfThoughts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:27:17 2015 UTC,I called mine right when I got a positive test and they won't see you until at least....8 weeks I want to say? They never asked me to come in for blood test to confirm. First appointment only for me was transvaginal - gird your loins.

CautiousBB,3dicrn,mcbarkenshire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"I went at 11 wks and she still used transvaginal.  I did a urine test, breast exam, and pap smear as well.  She took family history and we discussed any questions I had and that was it!"
CautiousBB,3dicrn,uhmv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:11 2015 UTC,"My OB said they can try to use transabdominal scans after 10 weeks but even then the vaginal scan gives clearer views.

CautiousBB,3dk0xf,autumnx,2,Fri Jul 17 00:01:02 2015 UTC,How many pregnancy tests have you taken? Is it possible you had a bad batch? It sucks because most of the symptoms for pregnancy are also symptoms for period. Fingers crossed it's good news for you :)
CautiousBB,3dk0xf,ShinyArcanines,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"What pregnancy test did you use?  Some of them are not very sensitive at all.  Are you positive about your DPO (ie, were you charting, using an OPK or something)?  Strangely enough, the cheapie Dollar Tree tests are more sensitive than a lot of the pricier tests.  If AF doesn't show within a day or two, I'd suggest taking one."
CautiousBB,3dk0xf,Grave_Girl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"This is what happened to me during my last pregnancy (miscarriage).  Apparently I randomly missed a cycle (i.e. didn't ovulate), so I was nearly a full month behind what my LMP EDD would have been.  Unfortunately, I never got to the dating scan before my miscarriage started, though they estimated I ovulated right when my period would have been due.  My doctor said it's not abnormal for women to occasionally skip a cycle or even ovulate twice in one cycle.  EDIT:  So to extrapolate a bit more:  I thought I was pregnant since I didn't get my period and I started having all of the symptoms up until I tested positive which was exactly 6 weeks from my LMP, or about 28 DP(what I thought was)O.   Hope that makes sense!"

CautiousBB,3dhqhl,Semirelatednonsense,3,Thu Jul 16 11:02:18 2015 UTC,Anxiety. Anxiety. Anxiety.   Ended up telling my cousin we are pregnant. She knows we've been trying and struggling for a long time. She confided that they also just started trying. Now I'm afraid something will happen to my baby and she'll go on to have a healthy one. Which is kind of ugly of me to be worried over.   Getting annoyed with foods sounding good until I eat about 4 bites of it. Then I don't want to even look at it ever again. Still getting minor cramps. Boobs can't make up their mind.   I'm going to have a panic attack if my obgyn makes me wait longer for an u/s. I need to see something in there and know it's ok.   I think I'm slowly losing my shit.

This worry is understandable, but know there is no merit to it. What happens to others has zero effect on you. She could give birth to a lizard, and while it may shock those around her - including you - it will not effect YOUR pregnancy.  That being said, I've been there, and it's hard to avoid those feelings. I'm also waiting on my first u/s (happening monday with a band new doctor) and I'm nervous as hell. Why must the first trimester go by sooooo slow?!"
CautiousBB,3dhqhl,Semirelatednonsense,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"We've had a slight competition our whole lives. Not that having children should EVER be a competition. But it's there. We've just in the last 5 or 6 years gotten to a point where we can discuss things and be close without always feeling like we're in a race.   That being said, it would be really cool if we both had babies around the same time. Especially for our grandparents.   I go in for my first actual appointment next Wednesday. Feels like it's 10 years from now. I don't know what the plan is for that appt but I intend to push to get an early u/s. For my mental health."

It is a duplex but their home flooded in a different year then ours. I hate being rude but the chick isn't in her right mind (like actually).

I'm scared of losing my job, even though they all know I'm a good worker, in general. My coworkers, however, drive me nuts.

Even the Zofran only goes so far. I don't have HG, and for that I'm very grateful, but being on the far end of the spectrum for nausea and vomiting is still awful. And on top of that, the never ending exhaustion and dizziness and general feeling of malaise.... it's brutal. I don't have the energy to do anything I enjoy. I can barely make it through work most days, and I'm falling behind in my workload. Yesterday I took a nap on the couch in the student center (I work in a university). Today, I drove my car instead of taking the bus so I could sleep in my car at lunch.  I honestly don't know how people do this gracefully and survive with work, life, and relationships intact. I've been nauseous and exhausted and miserable for eight weeks now, and I'm at my emotional breaking point. I've tried to have a positive attitude for so long. I wanted this pregnancy- badly. My last pregnancy was mostly asymptomatic, and I hoped and hoped this one would be different so I'd feel more relaxed. I got what I wanted and am so miserable.  Anyone else reach this point? Any advice for making it through? I'm 11 weeks tomorrow and hoping the second tri will bring better feelings..."

I started feeling taps a bit above my belly button, so I poked at her a bit ... and she kicked back! Twice! Even better ... she started kicking so hard I could actually see my belly move a little! I'm just kind of in shock, I mean I'm only 21 weeks + 4 days. I didn't expect so much movement so early. I guess having a posterior placenta this time vs anterior the first time really makes a difference. Anyway, it's a lot of fun, I'm loving feeling her move so frequently.

Explanations I had told to me were that it could be residue from implantation, a result of the fetus growing, so on and so forth.  Brown means ""old"" blood. You shouldn't worry, but if it would ease your mind, ask your OB for a blood test/untrasound to check on things. When I had mine, I got a blood test and everything came back good."

I don't know why companies get away with not having at least one HR rep.
CautiousBB,3dew4l,Pamzella,6,Thu Jul 16 11:53:13 2015 UTC,"This is so incredibly unprofessional. The first thing I would do would be to call the state Labor Board for any professional advice they can give you.   The president of the company IS HR if there is no separate HR person. So I would go park it in his office tomorrow until he sees you and demand an apology, and a retraction, as in a public apology to the company for releasing private information he did not have the authority to release. It needs to be absolutely clear in the wording from him that it is not to be mentioned in your workplace again.   I think you need that to protect yourself in the office, but also to make sure that it doesn't get back to your friends and family.  (I hope you aren't friends with anyone at work on FB or other social media.)  While I know you don't want to think about the worst case scenarios, I want you to take every single worst case scenario to that MAN in his office, explain all the possibilities of things that can happen when you are 6 weeks pregnant, and how many of those things no woman should have to share with her coworkers because a MAN in a position of authority did not keep information provided in confidence because you were legally required to confidential.  Shame the shit out of him with how unprofessional he was and how exposed you feel.  It doesn't matter that this is number 2.   Do it for you, and do it for every woman after you.   Then address the breach of etiquette in all situations, which he is obviously oblivious to.   Explain the part where news of this nature is no one but the pregnant woman's to share when and where she wants, and if it isn't the future grandparents news to tell ever, it sure as shit isn't your bosses' boss/president of the company."
CautiousBB,3dew4l,Tomkhagai,2,Thu Jul 16 02:56:19 2015 UTC,"I'm very tempted to go have a talk with management today, but I'm not sure what it will accomplish.  We talked at length when I informed them of my pregnancy about how tentative it still was and how I wouldn't be disclosing yet if I didn't have to.  I was reassured that they would not say anything until I did.    This sadly isn't the first breach of privacy I've had at this work place, and I can't even say that I'm that surprised.  If we had an HR I would definitely be filing a formal complaint, but filing a complaint with the person who has done something wrong gets trickier.  I'm worried it would more or less be career suicide to pursue this.    Any idea what the labor board would do with this information?  It would be pretty obvious the complaint came from me, so if they will just send off some sensitivity pamphlets or something as the solution I would imagine that would only make my life harder instead of better."
CautiousBB,3dew4l,Tomkhagai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:37:49 2015 UTC,"You talked about it, which is really unfortunate - lack of records. Put what they said in written form.

Whoever has the best records does better long term."
CautiousBB,3dew4l,autumnx,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I meant I talked about it with them in addition to in writing.  I gave them a letter in writing notifying them of pregnancy because of legal clause 'xx' and the letter states it is confidential information.  Both myself and management have signed this and I have a copy.    Filing a formal complaint would be an option, but would have to be filed to the guilty party.  It's a tricky decision as it would almost certainly affect the rest of my career at this company.  While they can't retaliate for something like this it's pretty hard to prove why they gave a 1% raise instead of a 5% raise for example."

CautiousBB,3dew4l,bangarang_bananagram,6,Wed Jul 15 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"My experience with the Labor Board is that they don't do anything without you, but they were happy to give me info in two different instances about my rights as a worker.   You can simply ask what the consequences would be in a situation like this and if they have any advice for you, because realistically in the US and in a not so respectful (or ethical or legally minded) workplace you could be subject to discrimination by coworkers, or have your job responsibilities taken away from you, etc. in ways that could be upsetting or negatively affect the money you expected to earn before you went out on leave.  If there is no HR, then this must be a very small company, and so you don't have as many protections as a company much larger the way the laws are written.   If there were legal ramifications and you took that info to the president and said, look this is what you did, and this is why it's a bigger deal than hurting your feelings.  You can make clear that anything besides accommodations that allow you to keep doing your job later in pregnancy could result in an interaction neither of you want. Not a threat, just a conversation about your rights and that you aren't going to look the other way if they are legally violated again.   If you do want to be snarky, then you suggest it's time to get someone to run HR at this place, because if they had, there might have been someone paying attention to the law in this case and not exposing you to potential hardship.   I agree with the other poster, when people comment, say, ""thanks, but that information s still supposed to be confidential at this point."""

In some states I believe you have to go through your local (state) employment discrimination office before going to the EEOC as well. However, if OP actually wanted to she could talk to someone at the EEOC about her case. If they were willing to take it I believe they'll appoint a lawyer to the case.  I am an attorney, but my practice field doesn't even come close to this area. I have helped someone file an EEOC complaint before and I believe they put an attorney in charge of his case, he didn't have to hire a private attorney."

The evening test was fainter because her urine would have been more diluted.  There is not much you can do at this stage apart from make an appointment with her doctor. I'm 8 weeks 4 days into my first pregnancy and if there's one thing I've learnt, it's that the first trimester is all about waiting. Some women get lots of symptoms. Some women don't, and it's hard to believe there's anything going on in there. But if the test is positive, she's pregnant.  That's not to say nothing will go wrong - no one can guarantee that for you - but your chances are good! Once again, congratulations!"
CautiousBB,3dg0ry,crapeau,3,Thu Jul 16 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"A faint line means she is pregnant.  When I had my chemical pregnancy, the line was so faint that I had to squint and check if I was crazy.    Unfortunately, mine was a chemical pregnancy (either fertilized and not implanted or implanted and miscarried almost immediately.)  When I did get pregnant two months later, I didn't believe the first pregnancy test and took another one a week later to confirm it.  I still didnt really believe it until my first ultrasound when I heard the heartbeat :)  You can go to your doctor and get an HCG test if you are concerned, they can check to see if it is doubling like it is supposed to.

CautiousBB,3dfab8,mariabutterfly,11,Wed Jul 15 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Waiting before TTC is what's best for you and for future babies. Having another ectopic is likely if you haven't given your body time to heal. In the meantime, perhaps try getting some testing to see if there's any reason for it. Specifically an HSG test. I also suggest posting over at /r/miscarriage."
CautiousBB,3dfab8,autumnx,7,Wed Jul 15 20:43:07 2015 UTC,So sorry hon about this and loosing your mom...  I had a couple ectopics and my oast one was just like yours.  They asked me go wait 3 months after the second shot.  There is some research that says that if you concieve earlier there is a higher risk for birth defects so it's not worth risking it.  I never heard of waiting for 6 months but I guess your doc is being cautious.  Bed rest until your HCG reaches zero?  It took me almost a month to get it down to zero.  I did spot and bleed for almost a month also but I was able to work and live a relatively normal life.    I lost my mom when I was very young.  There is something to be said about becoming a mom when your mom is gone.  I totally get it.  Keep your chin up.  It's going to be hard few weeks ahead of you emotionally but you'll pull through.  If you need anything please PM me.   Take care!
CautiousBB,3dfab8,vibeee,4,Thu Jul 16 00:04:50 2015 UTC,"I am so, so sorry for this scary experience, the loss of your pregnancy, and the loss of your mom.  What an awful lot to go through :(  I was not familiar with the requirement to wait 6 months after an ectopic.  I agree that sounds like an awfully long time to wait, when all you want is to try again for a healthy baby.  Maybe it would help if you ask your doctor to explain why that delay is medically necessary?  After a miscarriage, we are usually told to wait 1-3 cycles, but perhaps there are other concerns with an ectopic that he can explain.  Some doctors recommend more time to give us time to emotionally recover, which is just a personal decision and shouldn't be given as medical advice IMO.  In addition to /r/miscarriage I recommend you head over to /r/TTCafterloss.  It is a really supportive community and I know there are some ladies there who have gone through ectopics."

CautiousBB,3dfab8,Monpetitsweet,3,Wed Jul 15 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard the recommendation for 6 normal cycles before TTC after ectopic.  It wouldn't be a recommendation without reason, so as much as you really want to TTC sooner, I'd wait.  I highly doubt you want to repeat this experience."
CautiousBB,3dfab8,summersintheair,2,Wed Jul 15 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug but is also used for ectopic pregnancies. It's incredibly cytotoxic (it kills cells) and the effects can linger. I've heard of waiting to conceive anywhere from 1-6 months after stopping methotrexate, because the risk of birth defects/miscarriage is too high so the risk far outweighs the benefit. It sounds like your doctor is erring on the side of caution which is not a bad thing. It's incredibly frustrating for you and I understand that 6 months must feel like eternity to wait, but it's to lower your risk of birth defects back to your normal range before trying again.  I'm very sorry for the recent losses in your life, by the way x"

CautiousBB,3dfab8,Ironbornsuck,2,Wed Jul 15 22:40:47 2015 UTC,"I'm so incredibly sorry about everything happening to you right now. I hope you have a good support system in place to help you. My deepest condolences about your mother.   As far as the ectopic, I can just tell you my story and maybe that will give you some information even though my situation was a bit different from yours. I didn't have any bleeding or weird cramping. I had no idea anything was off until my dating u/s during my 7th week and there was nothing in my uterus. They did blood work (hcg went up but didn't double, low progesterone) and another u/s a week later confirmed an ectopic, location unknown.  I had a methotrexate shot the next day and five days later woke up to bleeding and labor like cramps. I have one child and it was seriously like being in labor. I know it isn't the same for everyone but it was pretty awful for me. Percocet helped a lot though. After the initial two days of strong cramps, it turned into just kind of a regular period with extra tissue.   I was told to wait three months or three full cycles before trying again. I had to go in for weekly blood work until my hcg went below 3.5 and that took a few weeks. From what I've read it's pretty standard for doctors to put a patient on a six month wait once they have had more than one shot and even though some doctors feel it is an unnecessary length of time, if the pregnancy was in a tube, it could be to also give your body time to heal.  How have you been feeling? If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Anything I can do to help, just let me know."
CautiousBB,3dfab8,Ironbornsuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:50 2015 UTC,"Fine, more pain from the shot then the ectopic. It's weird they keeping asking if it hurts and it's like no but the other side does (2.6cm x 2.45cm cyst on other side). It's on my ovary. The bleeding was old trapped blood. 3rd day after each shot was horrible terrible pain, and tiredness. Past three weeksish has been light bleeding and clots. I have pcos so waiting too long is scary for me."
CautiousBB,3dfab8,chels213,2,Wed Jul 15 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that shot is no joke. My butt was sore for days. Did they say where they thought the pregnancy attached? If your doctor thinks it was in a tube that could be the reason for the six month hold. I know three months felt like forever and I can only imagine having to wait six.   From what I read, two shots shouldn't mean doubling your wait time, it's just a standard doctors started doing and there isn't much of a medical reason for it. I am not a doctor though. I would definitely talk to your doctor about it again and maybe do some reading in the meantime. If he is just worried about the drug leaving your system, you may get him to reduce the number of cycles. I'm pretty sure I found medical articles about this very thing."

CautiousBB,3de60a,Semirelatednonsense,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"So this totally happened to me last week. I'm around 7 and a half weeks. Last Sunday was my birthday, and I guess I'm a glutton for punishment. Took a test and it was totally lighter than the control. Freaked out. Cried. Called my mom. She told me that they tell you not to test after 6 weeks. I'm stubborn. She told me to dilute my pee. First I did 50/50 water and pee. Darker test line but still not as dark as I needed it. Then I did about 80 water/20 pee and it was super dark and I could finally calm down. I felt like I definitely needed some sense slapped into me, thank goodness for moms."
CautiousBB,3de60a,rachelisalilly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:18:10 2015 UTC,I'm just worried that it's too early for it to be happening. My hcg rose from 73 to 346 at my first and second beta when I was about two and a half weeks. Haven't had a beta since. I just need to quit testing and wait for my appointment but it's so hard not knowing.
CautiousBB,3de60a,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:05 2015 UTC,I'm almost 8 weeks and I feel like my lines are going back to being as dark as the control line.

CautiousBB,3daau7,thesnugglypuppies,6,Tue Jul 14 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"How far along are you supposed to be? If I do my math correctly on the calendar, you got your positive test on 6/18 and that would put you at about 7 weeks from LMP?   It may be a blighted ovum but it may also be too early to tell.. Here's why:  Even if your tracking ovulation, you ovulate for 24-36 hours, and from there it takes another 1-3 days for the sperm to fertilize the egg, and an embryo doesn't actually implant until an average of 6-12 days.. So that gives you about a 2 week window for your actual dates to be off from your LMP, which is just a guesstimate.   So given that, that could put you closer to 5 weeks and some odd days rather than 7 weeks and some odd days, and before 6 weeks, it's likely that you may not see a fetal pole or detect a heartbeat which doesn't start beating until the 6th week. :)   I'd wait it out! There's still hope.   I suffered a miscarriage with my first. I'd prepare yourself for either outcome."
CautiousBB,3daau7,Luca_overthemoon,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:44 2015 UTC,"I should be between 6 and 7 weeks. My LMP started 5/20, but my cycles are notoriously bizarre. I'm concerned mainly with how big the gestational sac was with nothing inside.."
CautiousBB,3daau7,Luca_overthemoon,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:49 2015 UTC,Week 5 scans generally have a gestational sac size of 6-12mm and week 6 would have 14-25mm. So your gestational sac is actually in the 5-6 week range for measurement.
CautiousBB,3daau7,Luca_overthemoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"That's encouraging, then... right?"
CautiousBB,3daau7,jwad1246,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yup! It means it could still be too early to detect a fetal pole or heartbeat, not necessarily that anything is wrong, since you're in the 5-6 week range. :)"

CautiousBB,3daau7,Bebe-love,8,Wed Jul 15 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry... it doesn't look good to me.  If you got a positive on 6/18, the earliest you might have been on that day was 3 weeks (and even that is extremely early to get a positive). Assuming an early positive at 3 weeks, you should have been 6+4 yesterday.  At that stage, you should have seen a yolk sac, fetal pole, and most likely a heartbeat.  I have been in your shoes so I kinda know what you're going through.  The doctors got my hopes up a lot, but I knew when I did the math that there was just no way... unfortunately for me it didn't work out.  That said, there are always miracle stories, where the baby does grow and thrive, even when the dates just don't add up.  I would definitely encourage you to not take the misoprostol until there is ZERO doubt in your mind that this is a blighted ovum. The follow up ultrasound should definitely help confirm.  (I had three because I was in denial and I wanted to be absolutely certain!)"
CautiousBB,3daau7,autumnx,5,Tue Jul 14 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the honesty. It really doesn't look good to me, either, but I just realized I also have a retroverted uterus, and it makes me wonder if maybe that hindered the tech's view of it all.

CautiousBB,3daau7,autumnx,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"Ah, happy to hear you have a retroverted uterus, and coupled with a lousy tech!  It could definitely just be an oversight.

I wouldn't trust an abdominal ultrasound that early, but I have heard of clinics doing that. 14mm is a pretty tiny blob to see, especially with a retroverted uterus. Sorry you're in purgatory; tolerating the unknown is SO HARD, especially when you don't even know when an answer may come."
CautiousBB,3daau7,motherofdragoons,2,Wed Jul 15 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we did both. Transvaginal was when they saw the 14mm. I'm anxiously waiting hcg results tomorrow morning."

Then someone says I can pay $50 to reach my hand in blindfolded and grab the red marble. If I grab it, I get my money back. Do I really want to risk $50? Nope, because the chances weren't in my favor.  For you, the chances are in your favor of your baby being perfectly normal. I wouldn't worry about it, if you can."
CautiousBB,3d9l0a,Qwertyz13,12,Tue Jul 14 16:34:22 2015 UTC,"You need to think of these genetic screens as what if scenarios. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they aren't.

I also want to say that some of the most amazing people I've met have Down Syndrome."
CautiousBB,3d9l0a,autumnx,5,Tue Jul 14 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"The cell free DNA testing is really quite accurate, though you are right that it's not 100%. I think you need to keep in mind that until you get that back, you have a 98% chance that your baby doesn't have Down's.   Once you have a more accurate picture, you can start taking whatever steps are necessary--if you are in that 1%, you can have more monitoring, see a MFM, plan to go to a hospital with a well rated NICU, etc. For me, at least, nothing is more calming than having a plan that you can research and implement."

When you call to cancel, tell them you tested positive on HPTs and want to know when schedule your first appointment.  Every provider is different; mine let me come in around 6-8 weeks, but others wait longer.  The earliest you can hope to see a heartbeat on a transvaginal ultrasound is usually 6 weeks (or maybe a day or so earlier).  You might also ask about getting hCG betas for some peace of mind until your first appointment.  For me, the blood tests are no cost as part of prenatal care, but that will probably vary depending on insurance.  More extensive genetic testing can be done later on in the first trimester, but I haven't gotten that far yet.  Those test can be pricey (in the thousands of dollars), but of course depending on your insurance, it may be covered to some extent."
CautiousBB,3d9qfe,La_plant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:11:06 2015 UTC,Thanks! I think I might wait a couple more days then cancel. Seeing my OB for HCG bloodwork 6/20 then I think she'll be willing to see me as early as possible. Did you see heartbeat easily at first appt?
CautiousBB,3d9qfe,justcurious12345,2,Tue Jul 14 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"I had an ultrasound at 5w 6d and there wasn't a heartbeat.  The nurse thought she saw a flicker, but to me it just looked like the embryo was coming in and out of focus a little.  I have another ultrasound today (7w6d) to confirm cardiac activity.  The doctor wasn't at all concerned by the lack of a heart beat at that first appointment."
CautiousBB,3d9qfe,La_plant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"A couple more days is a good compromise :) I understand not wanting to jinx things.  My first pregnancy I had my first appointment at 7+3 and they found the baby and heartbeat right away!  Second pregnancy I came in around 6 weeks and there was no heartbeat, but also no fetal pole or yolk sac. It ended up being a blighted ovum confirmed a few weeks later.  If things were on track, they should have been able to see a heartbeat.  Now here we are, third time around. I am going in Friday when I should be 7 weeks and they should be able to see a heartbeat if baby is on track!"

CautiousBB,3d8rva,HazMat68W,3,Tue Jul 14 11:45:06 2015 UTC,I'm glad your hcg is great :) did they talk about maybe get suppliments for progesterone? At least just in case? I know nothing of progesterone levels so I can't say if it's supposed to be higher or not.
CautiousBB,3d8rva,Oneofthese3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:20:58 2015 UTC,"not at all. My OB hasn't said anything to me in regards to this pregnancy. I have an ultrasound set for monday, but I decided I want a new OB and scheduled another ultrasound the same day with a OB with great reviews (and recommended by other people i know who used him).  I haven't cancelled my original appointment yet....but I will b/c I'm having to go to Google for my questions."
CautiousBB,3d8rva,hopefaithandlove,3,Tue Jul 14 12:26:05 2015 UTC,Glad you are taking it upon yourself to get a new ob. This is an important person on your pregnancy journey and you need to feel supported!   I've not had my progesterone level checked. I'm on so many supplements I wouldn't know what normal is :( I hope you get your progesterone question answered.
CautiousBB,3d8rva,dancer331,3,Tue Jul 14 14:15:17 2015 UTC,"I would push back on your doctor if you're concerned. I also had spotting around the same time and started freaking out. It lasted several days and when I went in, my progesterone was 17 and they added additional supplements and all worked out well. Yours seems significantly higher but I can understand worrying about it dropping. I've read spotting is pretty common in pregnancy but it can definitely scare the crap out of you so don't feel bad asking the doctor more about it."
CautiousBB,3d8rva,dancer331,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:30:42 2015 UTC,"I would push back on your doctor if you're concerned.   I'll do this. You think I should go with my existing OB with this question, or the new one I'm planning on seeing Monday?"
CautiousBB,3d8rva,Qwertyz13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:04:27 2015 UTC,"If you keep spotting, I would ask your OB and not wait until Monday but definitely bring it up Monday as well. When I had spotting I was freaking out and would literally tell any nurse or doctor I spoke to. It's super scary and concerning when it's happening to you so they should understand your anxiety."
CautiousBB,3d8rva,Shortkaik,3,Tue Jul 14 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"It's normal for progesterone to fluctuate a little throughout pregnancy. I also have a theory that maybe it's a tad lower now because your corpus luteum cyst has been producing your progesterone, and soon the placenta is going to take over. I have no idea if that's true, but it could be one explanation. But still, I would ask a doctor about it. It could be nothing, but if it's bothering you, ask your doctor (and your new doctor too if you want).  If it helps, each sample the doctor takes from you is different from the last. Slight differences are normal from test to test. At least, this is what my doctor husband told me when I wouldn't stop taking HCG tests. :)  Good luck with the new OB!"
CautiousBB,3d8rva,chels213,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:37 2015 UTC,"Good luck with your new OB, I hope he is as good as the reviews you've heard say and that your ultrasound goes well!"
CautiousBB,3d8rva,septicidal,2,Tue Jul 14 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"Hey girl, my progesterone started at 30 and one week later it was down to 17. I had to go on progesterone until 13W. It is an easy fix, and I would just demand your doctor to test you weekly/a couple times a week to make sure it doesn't drop too low."
CautiousBB,3d8rva,septicidal,2,Tue Jul 14 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"Progesterone fluctuates throughout the day, especially if done after eating (it is likely to be most accurate if done while fasting).  I don't think your progesterone level is anything to be worried about at this time.  The one thing you might want to push back on, if you are still having spotting, would be to have an early ultrasound to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy and determine if a subchorionic hemorrhage is present."

I'm horrified I might get those for another 14+ weeks?!?!   I can't eat bananas for potassium or whatever simply because I hate them. I already drink a ton of water.

CautiousBB,3d84ve,Monsterandmayhem,2,Tue Jul 14 13:09:16 2015 UTC,"Happened to me too :/. It literally feels like my nostrils are smaller. I'm pretty much stuffy 24/7. This has been going on since about 13 weeks or so for me, and still going strong at 21+2. I do have allergies, and I switched from Zyrtec to Allegra, which helped some. But the majority of the stuffiness is still there - I sometimes get winded going up stairs just because I can't breathe right. I've just accepted it's going to be this way until I deliver. I highly recommend using Breathe Right strips at night to help you sleep - I'd wear them 24/7 if I could, lol."
CautiousBB,3d84ve,TheFinalFrontier47,2,Tue Jul 14 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"Pregnancy rhinitis is a real thing! Quite common, too. This link has some info about it as well as some safe treatment options."
CautiousBB,3d84ve,summersintheair,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"CONGRATS!!  Your body is producing so much more blood to support the little one, it often results in a seriously stuffy nose.  Can confirm, am 19 weeks deep over here."
CautiousBB,3d84ve,TomahawkDump,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:14:36 2015 UTC,I had this too. Apparently progesterone/ estrogen can exacerbate a post nasal drip. If you already have one like me it's not fun waking up in the morning.
CautiousBB,3d84ve,reidiate,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:22:24 2015 UTC,"Can confirm it's totally normal.  I don't have allergies either but have had a sorta runny nose the whole pregnancy,  in addition to the extra ear wax and discharge (tmi). I feel like I'm leaking out of every orifice lol"
CautiousBB,3d84ve,tinameri,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone! So does that mean it could be causing the nose bleeds as well? They aren't bad, but they have been happening off and on for about the past week or so."

I forgot to tell husband they told me everything was fine over the phone and when we opened the envelope together for the gender, he worriedly searched through every line of the test results thinking something was wrong. I was like ""Hun! We're having a boy! Look!"" he was like ""but what's all this other stuff??? is our baby okay???"" Oops. Major wife fail."

CautiousBB,3d6tqe,artipants,5,Mon Jul 13 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"I wish I could find it again, but I read some article last week that said both MaterniT21 and Verifi makers have worked out something so that no woman will have to pay that much for it. I think the max is less than $250 even if your insurance doesn't cover it."
CautiousBB,3d6tqe,dizzyvonblue,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:35 2015 UTC,"Well shut the front door. I was just looking into it last night, I saw the price tag, and was like we can do our whole nursery for 2 grand. I'm going to look into it again now. As long as it's <$500 I don't care to pay out of pocket for it."
CautiousBB,3d6tqe,Arrowmatic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"According to my OB out of pocket is between $25 and $200. I think your practice has to have an existing deal with the testing company, though."

CautiousBB,3d5jpn,Ironbornsuck,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:03:31 2015 UTC,I was right around 50 at 14DPO -- looks like it's rising great!
CautiousBB,3d4shx,AnnotatedAlice88,9,Mon Jul 13 15:00:13 2015 UTC,"That heart rate is a little low, and the most likely reason for that is because it had only just recently started beating.  It usually starts around week 6 and gets progressively faster. At 6w2d my girl's heart rate was 118. Now it hovers at around 140. It sounds like you have a great doctor who is keeping an eye on things."
CautiousBB,3d4shx,summersintheair,0,Mon Jul 13 15:19:06 2015 UTC,That's what I'm hoping for as well. I googled it (worst mistake) and they were talking about the fetal pole. My US tech didn't mention that to us at all. she just kept saying everything looked fine.
CautiousBB,3d4shx,summersintheair,3,Mon Jul 13 15:21:36 2015 UTC,If there was a heartbeat then you have more than a fetal pole so it's looking promising! Fetal pole develops around 5w - if that's not there then it's an empty sac which will sadly just not develop into anything.
CautiousBB,3d4shx,summersintheair,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"So because there was a heartbeat, then I'm looking good?"
CautiousBB,3d4shx,Luca_overthemoon,2,Mon Jul 13 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"Well it means you've progressed beyond a fetal pole which is great news! They say once you see a heartbeat the risk of miscarriage drops to around 5%. A heartbeat of 112 at about 8w would be a concern but my non-expert brain says everything sounds promising. You have a heartbeat at the right time, sure it's a little on the low side but if it only started that day or the previous day that is totally normal but your dr just wants to check to make sure the most likely scenario is the one that's actually happening.   I'd be anxious too, but still very hopeful and reassured that all signs are pointing to a normal experience."
CautiousBB,3d4shx,susanmack,3,Tue Jul 14 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"The presence or absence of symptoms are not an indicator on how healthy your pregnancy is. Morning sickness is a result of your body adjusting to the rapidly rising hormones, and not everyone's bodies handles this hormonal change the same which is why some women don't get morning sickness, some women have a little nausea, and other women get full on HG. Please don't think that because you're not sick that something is wrong with your baby. It's normal for your body to adjust to the hormones and for symptoms to weaken or disappear completely.  Since you mentioned your appointment was only 6 weeks, it's very likely that your baby's heart rate was low because (as another user said) it had just started beating. :)   I think the odds are most definitely in your favor!"
CautiousBB,3d4shx,Semirelatednonsense,0,Mon Jul 13 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your positive thoughts:) Honestly, I've been having the heavy uterus feeling for a while this morning, and to me that is a very POSITIVE sign:)"

CautiousBB,3d348a,jwad1246,7,Mon Jul 13 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"I would ask to have your blood drawn to check your progesterone levels and your HCG levels.  It wouldn't hurt to ask for progesterone pills since 9 is a bit on the low side for 7DPO.  I might be wrong, but at this stage, it wouldn't be an incompetent cervix.  I think that only happens when the baby starts to put pressure on the cervix and then it starts to dilate."

CautiousBB,3d348a,rcrumbsinmybed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:44:07 2015 UTC,"You can have all your hormones checked and I would imagine that supplements would be provided if needed. My friend had two MCs due to low progesterone, and when they figured that out, they gave her those suppositories (used through the first trimester). She had a healthy baby girl last month.  For me, they did an early blood test (13DPO) and then followed up a week later to ensure the levels were increasing at an acceptable rate.  I had spotting at 6w3d and I came in for bloodwork...should be getting the results today."
CautiousBB,3d348a,howverycleverofyou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:17:20 2015 UTC,I don't think 1st trimester spotting is really related to an incompetent cervix.  My mom had an extremely incompetent cervix and I don't think ever experienced 1st tri spotting.  They can't diagnose it until you in the second trimester of your pregnancy generally.

CautiousBB,3d22u9,howverycleverofyou,3,Sun Jul 12 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"I would be straight with him. Let him know you want him to initiate next time he's in the mood and you'll go along with it (that way it feels more spontaneous). I know my husband needs me to be direct. We had a frank discussion about sex while I'm pregnant, and then we just went for it to overcome both our nerves.  I won't lie, it took more effort to enjoy myself feeling bloated and tired and nervous. I had to concentrate on him and what felt good. I even asked him to ""talk"" to me, so I could keep my head in the game and not worry about every little bump to my cervix. But afterward, I felt great and more confident--especially after a trip to the bathroom to make sure I wasn't spotting.  Whatever you decide, I'm sure you two can figure something out. Just remember to communicate. Things are going to be a little different with a baby growing inside you, but that's okay!"

CautiousBB,3d22u9,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 13 19:28:23 2015 UTC,Mr HFL is also ready to be intimate again. Poor guy has sex dreams last night. I'm just not quite there yet. Every time I am something happens to set me back. The first time my sexy hormones kicked in I had my bleed before I could follow through. Then this week the spotting finally stopped and we just went for ... and of course I had some blood after. I know it's normal and it spotted right away but man does it kill my drive.   I'm glad to know your drive came back around 10 weeks because I'm only at 7 now. Maybe that will be a little how for Mr HFL.   Through all our ups and downs and years of treatment our sex life has gone through many phases as well. We've both learned to be open about our feelings. It's really important to communicate. I've been there with the awkwardness of trying to initiate after a dry spell. It sucks. It really helps if your partner ups his game. Lots of touching while watching tv and letting him initiate. Once you feel desired you'll get your groove back!
CautiousBB,3d1kur,hopefaithandlove,3,Sun Jul 12 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"So, I work really closely with registered dietitians, and one of them is FASCINATED with how pregnancy affects diets/palate/texture sensitivity etc. So I got grilled last week! I told her everything, how the nausea started and at first it was worst in the mornings, and then around 8 weeks it became all day with morning vomiting, then how I started waking up at night to vomit, pulling over on my way to work, basically every 4 hours. Then diclectin, then metallic aftertaste for like 10 awful days, and how I went from a total foodie (from scratch cooked everything) to only being able to eat french fries, potatoes with sour cream, pb+j sandwiches, popsicles and runny instant oatmeal. Which she said makes sense. Refined/simple carbs don't sit very long in our stomachs (which means our body has a chance to absorb the nutrients before our stomachs reject them) and don't require a ton of digestive enzymes etc. Plus they are easy energy for our bodies to metabolize-which would have been important in less food secure times. She then sent me a package of hemp seeds to try and stir into my oatmeal as they are (relatively) high in protein and omegas but don't taste too strong or affect the texture enough to turn me off. She also encouraged me to follow my gut, and eat what I can, when I can. Our bodies feed baby first.  Today I discovered that I can eat pulled chicken and pork-i think because the texture is less...chewy?? I was proud of myself I ate like 1 full serving of meat!! And it tastes awesome and I still feel great 5 hours later! I totally put pickles on them tho haha.  I used to be all about planning/prepping and cooking meals. It was my favorite weekend activity (I know..I'm the coolest). Since my food aversions were to all foods I just told my husband to buy what he wanted to eat, and I'd figure out my own stuff. So my advice is if you can not worry about it, don't. Just get through the worst of it and hope your not in the 10-20% that has nausea through their whole pregnancy... I never know what will agree with me or be appealing meal to meal. I had a solid of week of living on toast and carnation breakfast shakes. I'm starting to feel better though, I cut back to 2 diclectin a day and walked around a grocery store without puking yesterday. Putting that in a win column."

Tomorrow I'm going to try a protein bar with a piece of fruit and a glass of rice milk for lunch to see if that helps because yesterday I slowly munched on a protein bar mid morning and it seemed to lessen the nausea.
CautiousBB,3d1kur,littleblueowl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:53 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good plan. For some reason I haven't even thought to try smoothies. I think I'll have one for breakfast myself!
CautiousBB,3d1kur,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"I second this, I started packing Special-K protein bars (bc I'm allergic to oats and nuts) and having them mid-morning... Finding that I'm feeling much better for longer periods before the nausea returns, and have more of an appetite for foods that aren't totally carb-based later in the day."
CautiousBB,3d1kur,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:17:09 2015 UTC,I have high intolerance to a lot of foods and I'm wondering if that makes it all worse. But protein bars might be my saving grace right now.

CautiousBB,3d1kur,notantisocial,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:31 2015 UTC,"The last 2 years I've done small class special education. Basically 10 students with multiple exceptionalities in grades 4-8. This past year most of my students had autism. Next year I'm going to a new school because I was surplus this year. I managed to secure another small class but this one is grades 1-6 associated. Again, mostly autism diagnosis but lower functioning. Some of the students are non verbal and they work on very basic language and math skills. I'm going I will like it as I loved my class the past two years and I'm really going to miss the kids and staff I was working with.   What do you teach?"

Our school has the district autism unit and those teachers are some of the most patient, involved people I've ever met!  I team teach 2nd grade math/science. The year prior we looped from 2nd to 3rd with our class but our principal decided to end it this year. It's kind of a bummer because I really enjoyed seeing the kids grow so much.

With my daughter it only lasted a week or so but I also wasn't as sick then as I have been with this one. This is my third pregnancy in nine months though, so I am happy about being sick...?

CautiousBB,3d1kur,dizzyvonblue,2,Mon Jul 13 00:50:45 2015 UTC,"I have had morning sickness since the middle of 6 weeks and I am 10 weeks last Friday. I have thrown up almost every day during that time.   Today after spending another listless miserable day at work I tried to think of there has been ANYTHING that was helpful during this time. That worked every time. I realized the only thing that had been consistent was the being sick. I laughed in that morose mourning way.   My husband said to me today,""The what do you want to eat question is like trying to answer a riddle that is ever changing.""  So now that my ray of sunshine and positivity has been delivered. There actually has been a few things that are less likely to make me vomit. Here is the brief list but I wrote a full list for another redditor, you can probably find it in my history if you care to:   Gatorade is a gateway food if you sip it you can usually eat something else in a bit Popsicles, fruit or fugdsicle grapes, cherries, or clementines someone said Luna bars in the morning before you get out of bed, these are a yes the broth from soup, chicken noodle or beef and barley   Good luck fellow bumpers. Also I am on diclegis (expensive unisom and b6) it helps."
CautiousBB,3d1kur,TheFinalFrontier47,2,Mon Jul 13 01:32:31 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't think of Gatorade. I'll have to pick some up today. Thanks.
CautiousBB,3d1kur,TheFinalFrontier47,2,Mon Jul 13 12:42:34 2015 UTC,Try Pedialyte if you want the electrolytes with less sugar!
CautiousBB,3d1kur,DeFlee,2,Tue Jul 14 03:27:14 2015 UTC,"I just ate whatever sounded appealing to me.  Sometimes, I'd still throw up but sometimes, it'd stay down.  I noticed fruits and vegetables didn't like to stay down.  For a while, I didn't enjoy meat either.  Boxed mac n' cheese, potato foods, pasta and the like were my main ways of staying nourished.  Sometimes I could count on string cheese as a protein source.  During that time, I stuck with an iron-free gummy prenatal when I was feeling a lot less nauseous, or I'd take some folic acid at least.  Now I can take the regular horse pill prenatals just fine.  I lost a couple of pounds in the beginning.  Still haven't gained any at almost 16 weeks but haven't really lost any worrisome amount of weight either.  I want to say around 12 weeks or so, my aversions were almost gone and I'm able to include more protein and produce in my diet.  My stomach got used to lesser portions so I don't have a ravenous appetite, but for me, that's a good thing.  I wouldn't worry too much about eating some perfectly balanced diet.  If all you can eat is crackers and PB one day, then so be it.  Or if all you want are pretzels and ice cream.  The baby will still get what it needs for you and there will be a day when you'll feel you can eat more variety.  Even refined junk foods are fortified so you'll make it those few rough weeks.  Also, your doctor may be able to prescribe something to help you out.  And on that note, OTC-wise, sometimes, a half a Unisom and some B6 would work or I'd take a Dramamine.  Either will make you groggy though until you build a tolerance.  Also, my stomach is very acidic while pregnant, so Pepcid has helped out, too.  My OB office considers these safe to take during pregnancy.  If you think you are throwing up due to hunger and low blood sugar, a Jolly Rancher or other hard candy might be enough to keep your nausea at bay.  That's also worked for me at times."
CautiousBB,3d1kur,brycedoula,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:44 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. I'm definitely finding carbs the easiest!
CautiousBB,3d1kur,smf88,2,Mon Jul 13 12:39:18 2015 UTC,"I had all sorts of diet issues in the beginning, including not being able to handle any carbs, sugar, or dairy. I lived on vegetables, lost weight, but after I got dairy back I started with a suggestion from a pregnant friend, a smallish piece of dark chocolate and a glass of (whole) milk. It really helped, apparantly it has decent proportions of carbs and proteins and whatnot. I would have it first thing in the morning, during the day as needed, and usually before bed. After that, I slowly started being able to eat more food and felt less nauseous (was also doing prenatal gummi, b6, and unisom). I also started eating every 2 hrs regardless and I tried to make them protein focused snacks (nuts, seeds, cheese, yogurt, hummus was big for awhile, roasted chickpeas). Still puked everyday until basically 20wks and still have nausea flare ups but I've been gaining weight and everything is looking good.   During my first pregnancy, I lived on Kraft Mac N Cheese, saltines, and ginger ale for 3 months and everything turned out fine. Eat what you can, when you can, and have a good variety of healthy snacks on hand. The worst is when you're slightly hungry but you don't have food or the right kind of food. Good luck! I hope it passes soon!"
CautiousBB,3d1kur,crapeau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:36:23 2015 UTC,"Oh and water also made me puke, but sparkling water was AMAZING!!! I would drink a whole liter of that every night. I think not being dehydrated was a big part of feeling better too."

CautiousBB,3d1717,bebe0216,2,Sun Jul 12 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely call your doctor.  Your bp will go down due to the additional blood volume as will your bg, that's a very normal thing to happen even during first trimester.  But you'll want to keep talking to your doctor regularly to adjust your meds as things progress.   I can't speak to the bp but know that as you get closer to second and third trimester (around 20 weeks for me) your bg numbers will go up and continue to until you give birth.  The demand on your pancreas goes up a lot later in pregnancy."
CautiousBB,3d1717,tinameri,2,Sun Jul 12 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"The first trimester is notoriously a glorious vacation time for diabetics. Lots of diabetic mamas will see a ""remission"" of sorts for some or all of it. But the first poster is correct--the demand on your pancreas goes up and up no matter what you do. Are your providers not following your blood sugars weekly? If so, trust their interpretation of them. If not, you need to find yourself an endocrinologist, diabetic nurse specialist, or high risk OB who will follow your sugars weekly and help you know when it is time to treat them differently.

CautiousBB,3d1717,allthecaramel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:55:35 2015 UTC,The ob is getting me an appointment with a diabetic specialist but as of right now not extremely concerned.

I hate that my first reaction to her being in labor was jealousy.   It's been unseasonably warm here so I'm sweaty, our apartment is hot and almost nowhere has air conditioning. I'm thinking about trying to find a mall today to waddle in comfort.  So anyways I was grumpy all day yesterday. I planned my one weekly GD treat- I wanted a bowl of ice cream- and then I didn't even want it! Grump grump. My husband has to work from home today. Grump grump. My SIL who got pregnant the second she was married and had a unicorn pregnancy has her beautiful baby and all I have is heartburn and hip pain and insomnia... Grump grump. I'm starting to feel like I will never find my replacement at work... Grump grump.   So, today I am grumpy. I cannot imagine what the third trimester holds...  But positive...  Everyday I carry my baby I help baby grow bigger and stronger! I love feeling baby roll around inside me. Baby favors the transverse lie still, but sometimes moves up and down  Pregnancy sex is awesome! I got a new dress and it's adorable. I feel like I'm smuggling a watermelon in it!

Even though I can see her movements and feel her every day the idea that I will have a child at the end of this still blows my mind.

My first official prenatal appointment is Friday afternoon, at 11 weeks on the dot. I'm thinking they might change my due date, because our little one has measured ahead at the last two ultrasounds (was measuring 8+0 at 7+5, and then 10+2 at 9+5). I know exactly when I ovulated, so that idea is bugging me because I want my weekly pregnancy apps to be accurate. If I know exactly when I ovulated because I was charting, the baby may be measuring ahead, but should be progressing the same developmentally, right? Like, it's not going to sprout eyelashes two weeks earlier simply because it's an inch longer. So wouldn't changing the date in my apps change the accuracy of the information? Or am I thinking way too hard about this?"
CautiousBB,3d05wv,Oneofthese3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:26:36 2015 UTC,Will you have a 12w or NT scan? I've heard at those they can make the best assumption of the gestational age and people often go by that date. I know midwives and OBs in my country prefer to go by scan dates than ovulation dates. Maybe that scan will clear things up for you?
CautiousBB,3d05wv,palmtree23,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying; that's a great point. I'm sure we will have one, and I think my OB mentioned it. I get the sense everything will be figured out on Friday. Which country are you in, out of curiosity?"

An hour and a half left to go before I can go home and sleep.  I have a pre-pregnancy prescription for Maxalt, but it's a pregnancy category C so I'm concerned about taking it.  I even spent a stupid amount of time on pubmed/up to date reading journals about triptans during pregnancy (weekend nights are slow in the pharmacy in my neck of the woods).  I've indirectly left a message with the OBGYN on call to see what I could take.  My clinic delivers at my hospital, so I left a message at the nurses station.  No one in L&D progressed to delivery last night, so hopefully I'll have a message when I get back to work tonight.  At least about what to do for next time as mine very rarely last more than 10-12 hours.  But upside!

I've mentioned before we now know the gender, and we've had our gender reveal party, so I'm loving getting to say ""she"" finally!  My next appointment is in August and will just be routine, although I do want to talk more about VBAC v planned section. I got my post-operation report from the hospital where I had my son, and found out I was in fact officially diagnosed with arrest of labor and cephalopelvic disproportion. Obviously the CPD may not be a factor this time if this baby isn't as big (my son was 9 lbs 7 oz with a 14 inch head, and I'm 5'2""), but the arrest of labor diagnosis I'm guessing means my OB is going to be reluctant to do a VBAC. It concerns me, too - the last thing I want is another emergency section after labor since according to ACOG that's the riskiest situation of all. So I have a lot of thinking and research to do in the next few weeks so I can be prepared. I just want to do whatever is safest for me and Hazel, I'm not invested in any particular delivery route."

I have had some very mild pregnancy symptoms (mild constipation, mild food aversions, mild nausea, mild food cravings, etc), but for the last couple of days they seem to have eased off entirely.   I worry because during our last pregnancy we found out that we MCed at w9, but according to the OB we probably MCed week 6 due to the size of the embryo. I remember having lots of nausea the last time around w5-6 and that it started to subside around week 7. At the time I thought it was a good thing, but looking back now it was probably a result of my hormone levels decreasing. I know I'm being paranoid, but I was really hoping for some strong symptoms this week to make me feel pregnant!   Uhhhhg.

CautiousBB,3d05wv,simplysarah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"14 weeks. It was a rough week for non-pregnancy reasons... :( But in good news, I feel so happy to leave 1st trimester behind. I'm loving maternity clothes. I'm eating healthier (finally getting back to normal). I just barely had my integrated screening ultrasound on Monday, and it was lovely to see the little one from  so many different angles. Even a ""footprints"" shot, so cute! The ultrasound tech didn't say anything, but I think there was a bum shot and I think it's a girl (I know it's too early to tell, but my fingers are crossed!). :) She was moving her mouth like a fish, it made me laugh!"

CautiousBB,3d05wv,TryingMaybeNow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:58:39 2015 UTC,Emotionally.... I am now in the shitter.  My dad screwed up our visit when we were planning to tell him. He has know we were coming and what dates for a month now. Now he's telling me hes going to be out of town to move his mid life crisis girlfriend who is super young (and I have never judged) to a city near mine. He knew we were coming... and is trying to rewrite history saying he'd always said it might happen that week but that's simply not true.   I've been dreaming of telling my dad for a long time. He knows we hit roadblocks ttc health wise. And he would have cried when we told him and there would have been much hugging.  My mom knows nothing because honestly she probably won't care much.  We don't have a good relationship and she lives faraway.  That's why telling my dad in person meant so much... he's the one parent that cared and now he's gone and screwed it up.

It's suuuuper early - Aunt Flo isn't even late yet, and the pregnancy apps are all telling me I won't have even gotten a positive test yet! I've had a chemical pregnancy before, a couple of years ago (3?), so I am feeling cautious right now. But I'm excited to be here! We conceived on our 3rd try, which was truly our first try that we were actually able to have sex at the right time. I feel very lucky, but gosh did that feel like a long 3 months (especially since I've had baby fever bad for over a year). I am happy and excited, and want to tell everyone in the world but, again, it is SO very early. I've told my husband and my best friend... everyone else has to wait at least until AF is late! Happy to be here, and looking forward to sharing this time with everyone! Best of luck!"

I got a BFP at 10 DPO last Thursday on our second cycle trying. Feeling super lucky because my mom and sister have PCOS, and I had never been checked for it.   All of the women in my family have had at least one miscarriage (not always first baby), so it's been a struggle to be optimistic.

Symptoms include HUGE boobs (and they just got bigger over the weekend), bloating, occasional cramping, and as of this week...nausea. I've been tired since a week after conception.

Just enjoy feeling normal today (but don't over do it). If you have bleeding or cramping contact a health care provider.  Edited to add: that's how my nausea was around 6 weeks. It seemed to be more related to how well i was taking care of myself-if I didn't sleep enough or overdid it phydically, I'd pay for it the next day. Then I hit 8 weeks and I was sick and puking all the time (as in every 3-4 hours). Some days my boobs are DDD and so sore, other days my normal DD and feel fine. There is no rhyme or reason."

Some people have symptoms constantly. Some people feel better than they ever have. And then there's everyone in between those two! It's made it easier for me to realize I'm doing everything I can to keep this little pickle safe.  My body is changing and hormones constantly fluctuate. Today, I am pregnant.

CautiousBB,3cvwi8,wordswerdswurdz,3,Sun Jul 12 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"I got the blood test that checked for abnormalities for Trisomy 18, 21, and Down's Syndrome, and then further abnormalities if any of those popped up positive. In the test I took, results were either negative, to indicate no presence of abnormal chromosomes, or positive, and then provides a percentage of how accurate each individual component of the test is, e.g. ""99.4% accurate"". Background: I was 37 when I became pregnant and SO has one near relative with Down's. I liked the test option as one diagnostic tool that, in conjunction with the NT ultrasound at 12 weeks, could indicate whether invasive testing was needed.   A couple of points though: the doctor' offices will say the blood tests are ""99% accurate"" but in doing my own research I found that number to be exaggerated. It depends on the test, but it's more likely to be 85% accurate or even only 70% accurate. Since we were looking for something that would indicate whether invasive testing further on was necessary, I felt comfortable with the test's accuracy at the reduced numbers I found through independent research.   Second is how the test will influence your decision to carry to term or not. In the latter case, you want to do more independent research on the actual percentage accuracy of the test itself. If you're going to carry to term no matter what, then skip the test completely. It wouldn't make a difference and may cause more anxiety than would be helpful.   To me, it's important to be clear on what you would do based on the test results before you pursue the test. In the past few years, among my girlfriends who had the option for fetal DNA testing, a couple of them said they would terminate right away if the test showed a high likelihood of the baby having a chromosome abnormality. One of my friends said she was okay with a Down Syndrome baby, but not 18 or 21. And another couple of girlfriends said they wouldn't terminate no matter what so they didn't pursue testing at all. We're all above 35 and mostly FTM's. A lot of different factors played into everyone's decision, ranging from harsh practicalities of being ""older parents"" and not being able to raise a special needs child, to religious reasons for not terminating, to TTC for a number of years, to family support systems.   The bottom of the list of reasons for testing was finding out gender early, at least among my girlfriends and I. Sure it's fun, but the above reasons were much more compelling and necessary.   I'm in the US, by the way, and my SO and I determined beforehand that we'd pay out-of-pocket if insurance wouldn't cover the test. I expect the cost to be around $800 - $900. Pretty steep but we felt it was worth it and necessary for us.   Hope that info helps."
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,Sky9299,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:30:32 2015 UTC,21 is Down syndrome
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,mrswhiskerson,3,Tue Jul 21 02:25:23 2015 UTC,I really wanted the test but wasn't offered it because of my age. The benefits of it over standard first trimester screening is it looks at more chromosomal abnormalities that might not be picked up until the anatomy scan or even after birth (like sex-linked abnormalities). The nts and standard blood test are only looking at tri 21 & 18. So only you can really decide if you want to do it but I would jump at the opportunity but I thrive on lots of information (not everyone does).
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,Arrowmatic,2,Sat Jul 11 13:21:20 2015 UTC,"I got it and it was totally worth it for me. Great peace of mind, cost less than $200 and we're having a girl (no problems found)! I am 32, in case that matters, but have had one previous miscarriage. I would definitely do it again."
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,Bibbityboo,2,Sat Jul 11 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"For me it was worth it for the peace of mind. I had a rough pregnancy: IVF, SCH that bled out for a month with three weeks of bed rest, and now I have a tear in my placenta and more bed rest. So, my husband and I weren't feeling lucky and thought it would be worth it. Came back low risk (1 in 10,000) for everything. Meanwhile my doc recommended also doing the free screening (called SIPS in Canada) because it also looks at the placenta and how it functions. So sure, why not? It has a high false positive rate (5%?) so we knew harmony would trump it. Well the sips test came back 1 in 14 for downs. They can't give results over the phone in Canada, so I got a phone call asking me to come in that same day. If we hadn't done the Harmony test, we would have then, and would have had to wait almost 2 weeks for the results. I'm glad we already knew it wasn't a concern."
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,allthecaramel,2,Sat Jul 11 19:40:20 2015 UTC,"I think it is really, really important to remember that this is a SCREENING, not a test. It will not, and cannot, tell you definitively whether your fetus has chromosomal abnormalities. All it can tell you is the risk, relative to your maternal age, that the fetus has abnormalities. Emily Oster explains this really well in ""Expecting Better,"" I think.  That said, we will be taking advantage of cell-free DNA screening for this pregnancy. I will be 35 when I deliver and because of certain health conditions, the baby is at higher risk for neural tube defects and other disorders. If we were to come back with a high risk of a certain disorder, we would choose to have the more invasive tests (amnio, etc) that can confirm for sure."
CautiousBB,3cvwi8,cool_side_of_pillow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think we are very close (at least in all of Canada) to eventually getting that type of testing (NIPT) for free. I know that for women over a certain age the test is already free in Ontario. I had to pay $650 for it in British Columbia. Was it worth it? For me, at 40, yes. However, even at 33 I probably would have had it done too. It's as they say -- non-invasive and more accurate.  I find that the stress of having to wait and then have the testing done over a series of weeks isn't worth it. We were also prepared to make some difficult decisions were the results positive, so best to get the news as quickly as possible.   One thing we didn't care so much about was finding out the gender. We could have had all this information in our hands by week 11! Felt so early to me :). Anyway, cost was a factor but not a deal breaker for us. I think the covered/free option is still just as good in terms of outcomes, it's just something you wait longer to receive etc. Good luck!"
CautiousBB,3cunz0,howverycleverofyou,4,Fri Jul 10 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"My first inkling that I might be pregnant was because of dreams. I'm usually a pretty serious dreamer, mostly nightmares about dumb stuff. Wrecks. Falling off stuff. Being trapped. Standard scary dream.  But a few days before I tested I dreamed I had a baby and my dogs were puppies again. Instead of breastfeeding the baby I was breastfeeding the puppies. I could FEEL their dog mouths on my nipples.

One of my favorite pregnancy dreams was when I walked down to the river completely naked and slowly walked in with my huge belly and I sat on the bottom of the river like a mermaid, spread my legs and an enormous goldfish floated out of my vagina and swam away.

CautiousBB,3ctpre,2dotsandadash,10,Fri Jul 10 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue with chemicals like that is for YOU. Your skin chemistry changes when you're pregnant, so you are more susceptible to reactions from the stuff.  I can't imagine 2 minutes being an issue; if it was, it would specifically say on the bottle not to use it. But I'd wash it off really well, cause you didn't mention a patch test, so I'd be a bit concerned about possible allergic reactions/irritation because of it."
CautiousBB,3ctpre,Aari_G,5,Fri Jul 10 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Your baby is just fine, don't stress. I wouldn't use it again just in case, but 2 minutes really won't do any harm to your baby, especially not that early in the pregnancy. Alot of women drink and smoke at this stage because they don't even know they are pregnant and their babies turn out perfectly healthy. Your baby is well protected in there, don't worry."
CautiousBB,3ctpre,Melisara,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:29:16 2015 UTC,"In the early stages of pregnancy, the embryo is living off of the yolk sac and very well protected. If there were a serious concern about use of the product during pregnancy, there would be huge warning labels on it to protect the manufacturer from lawsuits...   In general, pregnancy hormones can do weird things to your skin so you may find your skin is drier or more sensitive than normal. But your baby is absolutely fine and not going to be affected."

CautiousBB,3csony,HazMat68W,3,Fri Jul 10 13:33:57 2015 UTC,Brown blood is old blood so I wouldn't be worried. It's probably still left over from implantation. I just had my scan at 6w4d and the doctor mentioned a bit of blood near the sac and told me I might see a little brown and not to be freaked out. I told her I had a seen very light pink a few times a week before and she said it was totally normal. She said she wouldn't typically be worried unless the blood is bright red. As long as it's just brown and you're not cramping try not to worry!

At my scan the heart rate was ""low"" and they wanted me to come back in a week. Well I've been a mess ever since and got them to move it a day earlier! Woo! Hopefully you can schedule a scan soon and you'll have some peace of mind.  Edit: also, if you can afford it you can go to the walk-in and have an ultrasound done there a lot of the time if you can't wait until Monday."

It freaked me out, but I tried to stay calm, drink plenty of fluids, and wear a panty liner to track color and amount. It stopped after 24 hours and I'm still pregnant at 7w3d.

The only change she recommended was for me to spread out my carbohydrates more throughout the day.  She emphasized that a certain amount of carbs are needed during pregnancy as the fetus only processes glucose and the effects of ketogenic diets have not been studied in pregnancy so the current recommendation is to avoid severe carbohydrate restrictions while pregnant.  Ultimately, I most likely need some medication changes, since I had significant insulin resistance (in the pre-diabetic range) prior to pregnancy, though I don't have full-blown gestational diabetes."

Future nursery clean-up is slowly moving along, I will hopefully make some more progress there this weekend.   I have been crying at EVERYTHING all morning. Mostly laugh-crying, thankfully. I couldn't go back to sleep after my 4am pee, so I was redditting and discovered the toronto raccoon. I definitely woke my husband up with my hysterical laugh-sobbing."
CautiousBB,3csb4d,theanonymousdame,2,Fri Jul 10 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Good morning, all!  37+2 today.  No sign of the babe, but that's just fine.  I bought some pH test strips so that I could reassure myself that I'm not leaking amniotic fluid, and it gave me peace of mind.   I'm a big sluggish today, most likely due to the fact that I nested well into the evening.  I'm looking forward to getting home and washing my curtains and cleaning the window sills.  Destroy all the filth!"
CautiousBB,3csb4d,hopefaithandlove,2,Fri Jul 10 16:50:05 2015 UTC,Knowing there is a heartbeat the fear is beginning to subside. I let myself walk in babies r us yesterday and bought the cutest little pair of socks. One step at a time.
CautiousBB,3csb4d,Dr_Vivaporu,2,Fri Jul 10 17:05:16 2015 UTC,I had a mini panic attack last night because the bf didn't check in after work. I kept thinking of everything that could've gone wrong and omg am I going to be a single mom?! Like super through the roof thinking of the worst possible things. Turns out his phone was on the fritz and all is well today after a visit to the Sprint store. He came to visit for lunch and I even got some Haagen-Dazs! I also get to see my bestie who I haven't seen in AGES later today. I'm having an amazing friday so far :)

CautiousBB,3cqyst,meganlove,2,Sun Jul 12 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Totally normal and a great feeling to know your boobs are working properly thus far :) I'm about to hit 27 weeks and have had some minor leakage for about 10 weeks! Definitely freaked me out at first but now I think it's pretty cool.
CautiousBB,3co7s3,whatgoesup56,12,Thu Jul 9 13:05:36 2015 UTC,My doctor couldn't even find the heartbeat with a doppler at around 20w.  I definitely don't trust myself to find it at home!
CautiousBB,3co7s3,BananaBoggle,3,Thu Jul 9 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, half the time my doctor has to search and search and search forever to find a heartbeat. He had even warned me against buying a home doppler because of how inaccurate/difficult to use they were and how much stress they cause when they don't work."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,violetvgn,7,Thu Jul 9 14:48:12 2015 UTC,"At my 12w NT scan, the ultrasound tech pointed out the heart and said to me ""It's about the size of your pinkie finger nail right now. Amazing, huh?"". And that's the size you're trying to find at 12w so for you it's marginally smaller. Your uterus is still very low down, you might have an anterior placenta, lots of factors. I got my doppler out at 13w and took about 5 minutes of very slow, painstaking searching where I'd hold the wand in place, then slowly angle it different ways. Sometimes holding it straight down did nothing but then angling it 45 degrees found the heartbeat. Then the little one didn't like being spied on so wriggled away, every time. It must be loud for them or something.  Also when you say you can hear the placenta, it might be your abdominal artery you're picking up, that also sounds like wind and would be higher up."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,summersintheair,6,Thu Jul 9 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"I got mine and tried on 10+3 I think. I didn't find anything. Waited 2 days and tried again and found the heartbeat. Now at 11w I tried again and couldn't find anything. I think it's just sometimes harder. The baby is still so small and so buried in there so it takes a while to find it. Remember, we always just see the ones that find it easily because they other ones don't post a video!"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Oneofthese3,4,Thu Jul 9 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Oh girl - step away from the Doppler! I have one, but I wasn't allowed to use it till 13W. Even then it was hard to find. I am 23W now and it's hard to find it."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,chels213,3,Thu Jul 9 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"For my first pregnancy, my initial midwife appt was at 10+3; she didn't get out the doppler because she said it's not a sure thing to find the heartbeat and it creates more anxiety than necessary. At 10 weeks your uterus isn't even out of your pelvis yet, so it's completely within reason that you can't find the heartbeat.  (Also, try digging down low and center, right over your bladder. You may be trying too high.)"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,lancealittle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try again, which is strange because I can hear the placenta up high, it sounds like wind"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,palmtree23,2,Thu Jul 9 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just a few days behind you and mine is crazy low. Basically right on top of the pubic bone. It's almost impossible to probe too low, especially at this stage."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,agnesb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Did you see the other post suggesting you might have found your abdominal artery instead?  Your placenta has to be in your womb which is still in your pelvis.   Don't panic, breathe, read up on the anatomy and growth of both baby and you and chill out.  I can't believe how many times I googled to find out my uterus size :)"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,female_engineer_here,3,Fri Jul 10 05:58:50 2015 UTC,"My doctor couldn't find the heartbeat using a doppler on me at nearly 12 weeks, we got an extra ultrasound because of it.  Everything was A-ok.  This is the same reason I haven't bought a doppler - I think it would drive me insane!"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,female_engineer_here,2,Thu Jul 9 14:26:09 2015 UTC,I just don't know if I should go into an urgent care and calm my nerves or just wait for 2 weeks :/
CautiousBB,3co7s3,natural_seattleite,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"I really think it's just not picking it up.  But, if it will calm your nerves go ahead and go to the urgent care.  Then put away the doppler til you're at least 15 weeks."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,palmtree23,3,Thu Jul 9 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"It's not always easy to find the HB, especially in 1st tri.  Somewhere around mid-way through you should be able to find it consistently.  Before that, it's okay if you can't - just frustrating.  Try laying on your back with a bunch of pillows under your butt.  The decline position will slide your uterus up and clear of your pelvis in the best case scenario - you might find it's easier to locate the HB that way.  Try not to get distressed in the meantime - the doppler will yet make you glad you bought it."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,palmtree23,2,Thu Jul 9 21:52:53 2015 UTC,No luck with the doctor either but he said my pregnancy test was still positive he gave me a referral for an ultrasound but my nt is in less than two weeks so I think I'm going to wait.   In the mean time apparently I have a uti
CautiousBB,3co7s3,palmtree23,2,Fri Jul 10 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the individual. It can also depend on that particular pregnancy. I found it at 8+5 and it's been a little easier to find every day since then. Once you find it and have an idea of where to look, it becomes much easier. Also, I'm pretty sure the wind sound is the gestational sac. The heartbeat should be somewhere around there."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,sejinshi,2,Thu Jul 9 14:10:29 2015 UTC,Yeah there's nothing but the wind and my pulse
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Arrowmatic,2,Thu Jul 9 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my comment came off as flippant and braggy. I wrote it in a hurry. I meant to say, try to stay positive (I know it's easier said than done!). The majority of people can't find it consistently. I know there's going to be a day soon when my baby moves and I can't find it and I'll freak out. When is your next appointment so you can get some reassurance?"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Arrowmatic,2,Thu Jul 9 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"I just decided to go to an urgent care rather than the ER, I only have a Gp currently and no ob.   My nt scan is in 2 weeks"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,JShell329,2,Thu Jul 9 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"Well, definitely keep us updated! Since you've already had a good couple of ultrasounds, statistics are wayyyy in your favor that everything is fine, and hopefully this will be some good reassurance that helps you relax until the NT scan! I know how freaky it is to have no symptoms. It's basically impossible to feel comfortable. Crossing my fingers for you!"
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Lyssabex,2,Thu Jul 9 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"I bought one thinking it would be fun and interesting to check once in a while. Nope. At 23 weeks, could only find it once out of 4 tries. Tried again at 24 weeks and still took a couple of tries and I could barely hear it. I'm returning it."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:25:24 2015 UTC,"I guess my biggest issue is a I bought the sonoline b which is supposed to be decent and I get that it's terribly hard to find.   But do I just take a step back stop freaking out and move on or do I give myself a piece of mind and go to an urgent care.   My boyfriend would murder me if I went but,  I'd rather know the baby is okay, 1 because I've had zero symptoms."
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Bibbityboo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:29:58 2015 UTC,I have the Sonoline B and it still took me 3 tries over 3 days to find the hearbeat for about 10 seconds and 4 tries to actually get it properly. There's definitely a learning curve with dopplers. You have to be down a lot lower than you might think and angling it properly. Once you find the baby a couple of times it gets a lot easier though because you know where he/she likes to hang out.
CautiousBB,3co7s3,MarshmallowGuru,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:15:31 2015 UTC,Yeah no luck at the doctor either still pregnant according to the test they did.
CautiousBB,3co7s3,Oohthatsright,2,Fri Jul 10 00:07:57 2015 UTC,Did he just do a pee test? Those can't tell you much. I'm surprised they didn't give you an ultrasound.
CautiousBB,3co7s3,septicidal,2,Fri Jul 10 01:06:06 2015 UTC,Wasn't a hospital he referred me to get an ultrasound buy the soonest is next Wednesday and my nt is the following Tuesday.
CautiousBB,3co7s3,justdogethings1,2,Fri Jul 10 01:13:16 2015 UTC,I just figure if they are so  close together if I can hold it together for a few extra days. He said he wasn't worried I've had no cramps no bleeding

CautiousBB,3co7s3,meganlove,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:55 2015 UTC,Took me days of trying to actually find the heartbeat. My LO is down very low and to the right... Practically on my hip bone. Don't give up!
CautiousBB,3cny8k,reidiate,18,Thu Jul 9 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"I would be so insanely angry at the doctors staff, that is so wrong and inappropriate. I would also be pissed at the Doctor because timeliness is clearly an issue for her. That being said I'm really unclear why you're angry at the other woman? Did they tell her she was taking your appointment? After an hour of waiting and with errands to run I would have done the exact same thing as her, and I doubt i would've realized I took someone else's appointment in part because it is so hard for me to imagine a doctors staff ever doing something that ridiculous."
CautiousBB,3cny8k,susanmack,10,Thu Jul 9 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the receptionist and doctor were wrong, the lady was not. Op is taking her anger out on the wrong person."

She could have walked outside. I'm also super pissed she complained she had to leave and happily took MY appointment to return a parka. She was so pleased with herself after she got it. She bounced right in. She KNEW I was ahead of her. She had asked so she KNEW she was taking my appointment. I hope the death stare I gave her gives her nightmares.

I wouldn't give them any more business. Then write an honest review online or something. That is unacceptable and there is no excuse for it.

CautiousBB,3cny8k,Lyssabex,5,Thu Jul 9 15:26:25 2015 UTC,WTF. I got angry for you just reading this!  I'm sure you're tired of shopping around for OB's but I would stay away from this one. If this is an example of patient care I would not want to be putting mine or my baby's health in their hands whatsoever. Who knows what other crap they'll pull down the line.  Inexcusable.
CautiousBB,3cny8k,Sharra_Blackfire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:46:42 2015 UTC,I agree so hard. OP shouldn't put her and her child's lives into the hands of someone that unprofessional and who has no qualms with obviously lying off the top of her head to cover for her staff
CautiousBB,3cny8k,hopefaithandlove,2,Thu Jul 9 18:42:26 2015 UTC,I can't believe they switched the appt like that! If you were late or there was an empty appt sure but they were running behind and You were there for your appt! You are right it's completely unprofessional.

They're also testing to see if I need progesterone supplements since our last pregnancy was a loss. Overall I felt better leaving the appointment than I did going in. The OB was very conscious of my fears and worries, which I really appreciated. Love my OB/GYN."
CautiousBB,3cnwnq,motherofdragoons,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"anyone want to talk me off the ledge?  had anatomy scan yesterday and everything looked great! (yay). Tech commented on how active she was.  I've been having trouble sleeping and last night was no exception. I woke up at one point partially sleeping on my belly, I woke up because it hurt. My tummy is sore today, don't know if its from that or from the ultrasound. Gracie is not nearly as active today I think I've only felt her once.  I'm terrified of harming her from turning over onto my stomach in my sleep."
CautiousBB,3cnwnq,vibeee,2,Thu Jul 9 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"There is not way you could have harmed her.  I'm 32 weeks and there are days when I feel him poke me once or twice during the day.  They do sleep and they go through growth spurts.  If I listened to my OB and did proper kick counts I would be in her office twice a week.   I also had a scan on Tuesday - it was one of the days when he was pretty quiet, not much movement.  He was bouncing up a storm in there and I didn't feel anything.  I also have anterior placenta so it blocks most his movement.  Garcie is fine!  Stop worrying!"

My doctor hasn't put any restrictions on sleep positions unless they make me uncomfortable.  As for soreness, I was way sore after my anatomy scan... They did lots of jiggling to get baby in view. :)"

CautiousBB,3cko3b,Threebearsmomma,2,Thu Jul 9 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"I'm normally a lurker but I had the exact same fear when I was pregnant with my twins.  They were spontaneously conceived after dealing with infertility with my oldest.  Go figure.  I was so terrified of a vanishing twin....  But I think it's definitely a case where google makes it seem so much more prevalent than it is!  My goofy, silly pair were full-term at 38 weeks and are amazing 8.5 year olds now (who still don't know they are going to no longer be the youngest come December).    I had an incredibly easy pregnany with them, no complications, and they were 6 lbs and 5 lbs 12 at birth.  Have faith that it really can be that easy.  As for registry items, if you plan to tandem nurse make sure you get a pillow specifically for that.  I used  - and they still make I believe - the ez-2-nurse twins pillow but boppy has one for twins too.  It was a lifesaver (we nursed exclusively for 4.5 months until I had to supplement while they were at daycare bc I couldn't pump enough so they got formula during the day.  Weaned them at 9 months only bc I broke my ankle and had to have surgery!)  As an older twin momma, I can tell you that it's hard in the beginning, but I consider it the best gift the universe ever gave me!  The bond they share is truly amazing.  Enjoy the ride!"

CautiousBB,3cklat,luvkraft314,4,Wed Jul 8 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Hi there. At almost 7w my progesterone was 14. They put me on 200mg suppositories, two times a day. I did it until 13weeks to be sure. I didn't get my numbers again but the doc seemed pleased.   I've never had a miscarriage but it took 3 years to get pregnant with this one so we weren't taking any chances. I'm 15w tomorrow. I hope this helps and congrats!"
CautiousBB,3cklat,FireyLily,3,Wed Jul 8 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I was put on Prometrium during my previous pregnancy, that ended in a miscarriage and the current one. During my last time I was spotting and had very low progesterone at 2-3 and was on 200mg prometrium. Unfortunately it din't help and I lost that one. CD 21 blood work showed low progesterone after ovulation so I was asked to start prometrium every cycle after ovulation.   This pregnancy too, my progesterone was low, but still at 15-20 ish, but my doc was not too happy and I continued with it till 12 weeks. I don't know if prometrium helped or not, but for me I was at the stage where I would try anything to make the baby stick. As the side effects were low and very rare I decided to go with it. Good Luck!"
CautiousBB,3cklat,auntluv,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:48:07 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad to hear that your pregnancy is going well this time!   Out of curiosity, were you on 200mg of Prometrium just once a day?"
CautiousBB,3cklat,auntluv,2,Wed Jul 8 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yes, it was just once a day. BTW, they were vaginal suppositories."
CautiousBB,3cklat,bioengnerd,2,Thu Jul 9 03:02:16 2015 UTC,"First, congrats! I've never suffered a miscarriage before, only a chemical pregnancy. But, we were having trouble getting pregnant and my doctor found I had PCOS and low progesterone after ovulation. I was put on 200mg prometrium pills (oral) from 3 dpo (we had trouble getting pregnant and were on fertility drugs as well and had ultrasounds to time ovulation precisely) until 12 weeks. I'm still gestating at nearly 37 weeks. Not sure if progesterone helped, but it certainly didn't hurt :) Best of luck!"
CautiousBB,3cklat,bioengnerd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"Congrats to you as well :)! I'm really glad to hear that everything is going well with your pregnancy.  If you don't mind me asking, do you remember how low your progesterone was when it was tested? I am mostly just curious because I've read about some people with progesterone higher than mine still getting put on prometrium, and about some people taking a dose as high as 900mg, so I was curious to attempt to find out if I'm really on a high enough dose."
CautiousBB,3cklat,Ironbornsuck,2,Wed Jul 8 17:49:29 2015 UTC,She never gave me a value. I wasn't pregnant when she measured it. She was getting baseline bloodwork to figure out why we were having trouble conceiving. I think 200mg is the normal dose. I'm not sure that more helps. Your body probably only absorbs so much.
CautiousBB,3cklat,littleblueowl,2,Wed Jul 8 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Congratulations first of all : ) Secondly, I've also had an ectopic followed by an early miscarriage/CP so I understand your worry. My OB just wanted my progesterone to be over 10 and was happy with anything over that. My ectopic and CP both had low progesterone (9 and under) and my levels just went down obviously.   With this pregnancy my levels started at 16.8 went down to 13 and then back up to like 15.3. My OB was happy and didn't put me on a supplement. So far, so good! I think it really comes down to what makes you feel best. My cousin's OB thinks they don't help and my OB has you get on them if your levels don't seem like they will go up on their own.   I know what you mean about feeling like they're low. I read a bunch of things online and women saying they had progesterone levels of like 62 made me feel like there was something wrong with me. In all of my reading I came across a fertility specialist and his thoughts on progesterone and it made me feel 100x better about the whole thing. I'll look for it and if I find it I'll link it for you."
CautiousBB,3cklat,in2thewoods,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the info! If you do happen to run across that article you mentioned, I would absolutely love to see it."
CautiousBB,3cklat,in2thewoods,2,Wed Jul 8 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"After 2 CPs and a MC, my dr. put me on 200mg prometrium 2x a day, even though my progesterone levels looked typical every time. I think they decided to throw everything at this pregnancy to make it stick, and it seems to be working so far. They also put me on 2.2 mg of Folgard (folic acid plus some other stuff) due to my MTHFR dx, and learned that I was SUPER hypothyroid this time around (on thyroid meds too). Not sure if it was any one of these things, or the combo of them all that have made baby keep on growing into my 12th week, but I'm thankful! Add'l fact, though, I was on 100mg of progesterone my last pg which ended at 6 wks (always wonder if we kicked it up to 400mg like this time around if it would've stuck?) who knows. A happy&healthy 40 weeks to you!!  edit: took prometrium suppositories until week 11, dr. said the placenta kicks in around week 8 and anything after that is just for peace of mind. So happy to be off the nasty things! Energy returning a little bit, boobs less sore, and things actually ah hem moving again more regularly :D"
CautiousBB,3cklat,dizzyvonblue,2,Wed Jul 8 21:26:28 2015 UTC,"Welcome and congrats!!  I was put on 200 mg/day of prometrium for this pregnancy until 12 weeks.  I believe my levels were 4 as well starting out.  I am 12w3d today and I still have prometrium so I will take mine until they run out, my doc said there is no benefits of it after 12 weeks but that is doesn't hurt either if I take the rest of the bottle.  Currently I take: 1 Pre natal, 1 folic acid and 1 prometrium.  Hope that helps!  Best of luck!"

CautiousBB,3cjupg,bebe0216,8,Wed Jul 8 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"It could be you have a sensitive cervix and it bleeds a little if irritated.  I know it must be very scary and alarming, but the fact that they saw an embryo and heartbeat on ultrasound is very good and bodes well.  The odds of miscarriage drop dramatically once a heartbeat is visualized at 8 weeks.  One thing that helped me in the earliest days of pregnancy was reminding myself that whatever happened, nothing I could do would change the outcome, and if a miscarriage did occur it would most likely be due to a chromosomal issue which was determined at fertilization."

I'm ok with waiting until the appointment to be seen but thats just because I know there isn't much they can do if it is a miscarriage. I'll look into the doppler, I didn't know you could get them for home use."
CautiousBB,3cjupg,Sharra_Blackfire,3,Wed Jul 8 16:12:08 2015 UTC,Yeah! They're only about $50 US. Mine helps me feel less paranoid

CautiousBB,3cjupg,Sharra_Blackfire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"7 weeks, but don't take that as the hard rule of how early a heartbeat can be detected. It just varies, and also of course hospital grade equipment is more sensitive than home-use. But once there's a strong heartbeat from week 9 onwards-ish, it's just a really nice, comforting tool to have"

CautiousBB,3cjupg,Aari_G,4,Wed Jul 8 20:48:51 2015 UTC,"You may have a friable cervix (one that bleeds easily thanks to all the hormones).  I had one.  Going to the bathroom, sex, heaving too hard when throwing up, transvaginal ultrasound, pretty much anything would cause it to bleed.  At 12 weeks I had it cauterized with silver nitrate and while it temporarily bled worse than had it before the cauterization, after a week it completely stopped.  I also passed two clots.  The uterus is stretching, the placenta is attaching itself.  Sometimes the uterine lining gets knocked out.  If you aren't seeing a lot of clots, it's probably nothing too serious.  I don't know how to not worry about it.  I get freaked out before every OB appt.  I just know that I have no control over it and if something does happen, it was determined at conception most likely."
CautiousBB,3cjupg,reidiate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:12:25 2015 UTC,I did bleed after the initial visit pap. The ultrasound didn't cause any though. I have been pretty swollen and puffy and tender down there so maybe it is just sensitive.

CautiousBB,3cfmrk,k2p2,2,Tue Jul 7 15:29:30 2015 UTC,Super excited! I had to get on here and make it known! I'm assuming I'm around 4 weeks right now (weird ovulation) and will be going for my first appt the 22nd. Here's praying everything keeps trucking along until then!
CautiousBB,3cfmrk,k2p2,2,Tue Jul 7 15:33:06 2015 UTC,I'll have my fingers crossed! :D

CautiousBB,3cguev,AnnotatedAlice88,3,Tue Jul 7 20:22:30 2015 UTC,"Just hit my third trimester and I'm still going usually a few times a day. Not always the gassy/runny stuff either, sometimes it's just a lot of poo. I wish you much poo in your pregnancy, as being backed up sucks from what I've read."
CautiousBB,3cguev,fancythenancy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Hahaha!!! I guess your right. It could be worse, lol"
CautiousBB,3cguev,septicidal,3,Tue Jul 7 23:17:58 2015 UTC,My lactose intolerance went into overdrive and caused this. My OB said its common to experience lactose intolerance or a worsening of preexisting intolerance during pregnancy.
CautiousBB,3cguev,chels213,3,Tue Jul 7 22:32:25 2015 UTC,O great!! I was lactose intolerant before the pregnancy:( guess I know what to avoid from now on!
CautiousBB,3cguev,epiclady,2,Tue Jul 7 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't have runny butt, but in my first trimester I had great BM. Now in my 2nd they aren't so great and I have constipation. Maybe take some probiotics to help make you solid?"
CautiousBB,3cguev,female_engineer_here,2,Tue Jul 7 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"I had chronic diarrhea for years off and on. Turned out I had a very defunct gall bladder (no stones... Just straight up dead). After that was removed? Much better. I had to go on metformin for PCOS and that tore my stomach apart again. I stopped taking that at 14 weeks and thought ""I've never been constipated.. What an interesting change this will be...."" NOPE. Still content constant issues. I've tried every food sensitivity and allergy I can think of, at this point I just think ANYTHING affecting my stomach will send me to the bathroom... Maybe after the baby comes? :/"
CautiousBB,3cguev,AleeriaXKeto,2,Tue Jul 7 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I was like that in the first trimester.  Now it seems to have calmed down some.  But, I definitely had some runny poos at first, apparently it can go either way!"
CautiousBB,3cguev,k2p2,2,Tue Jul 7 21:43:10 2015 UTC,No you aren't!! I am right there with you. It has settled into constipation now that I am starting the second trimester though. Some women get runny poo during the first trimester a lot it seems. Mine was in conjunction with god awful morning sickness as well. Remember to try and keep as hydrated as possible and be on the look out for symptoms of dehydration.
CautiousBB,3cguev,sbrib,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:10:21 2015 UTC,Morning sickness just started yesterday. It's an all day kind of thing but I get waves of it so I can still sneak some food in there. I have noticed that I'm not drinking as much water and replacing it with sprite. I'll try and work on it:)

CautiousBB,3cevqa,whatgoesup56,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:11:20 2015 UTC,Peppermint tea!! Was getting sore and tried this tonight
CautiousBB,3cevqa,knirbe,4,Wed Jul 8 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"Nothing especially gross this week, but today is 24 weeks!! I can't believe it! Unfortunately I have a headache and I'm SO exhausted this morning.   My baby either hates or loves the sonicare toothbrush. It wakes her up every time I brush my teeth... Is baby being too quiet? Time to brush my teeth!!   I'm having a serious dilemma with the current Target sales. I'm really tempted to go ahead and buy the carseat/stroller combo I want, because I doubt there will be a better deal on it before October, but... it's a major purchase!"
CautiousBB,3cevqa,aintnochickenwing,2,Tue Jul 7 12:01:46 2015 UTC,"Ooo I had no idea about that sale! Now I want to spend money... But do remember that if you register with them, you get the completion coupon at the end. I think. So it might be cheaper to buy then, assuming you don't receive it as a gift before then."
CautiousBB,3cevqa,knirbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:11:29 2015 UTC,"I think their completion code is 15%, but you can sign up for their baby list to get 10% on top of the $40 gift card. And I think the 5% for red card is on top of everything.   I'm really skilled at talking myself into buying things :)"
CautiousBB,3cevqa,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:29:53 2015 UTC,Haha excellent! Just as long as you know the best deal for you! Luckily I can resist this sale since I don't currently have anywhere to put baby stuff (sister currently living in baby's room) so I don't have to think too hard about it.
CautiousBB,3cevqa,septicidal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:47:54 2015 UTC,"The completion discount for a Target is 15%, I believe, but I'm not sure how that stacks with other discounts."
CautiousBB,3cevqa,aintnochickenwing,3,Tue Jul 7 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"It's only been about 5 days since I was put on pelvic rest, but I'm sick of it already! My second trimester libido had really kicked in the last few weeks and I want my husband more than ever, but I can't do anything about it. Even more frustrating is that I feel great, and have never had any other signs of the previa besides it showing up on the ultrasound.   Sigh. I'll do anything to keep my baby safe, but damn if this isn't frustrating."
CautiousBB,3cevqa,whatgoesup56,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:36:01 2015 UTC,"I've never been on pelvic rest, must suck.   But in terms of your libido are you a fan of blow jobs? Is that allowed?"

CautiousBB,3cevqa,whatgoesup56,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:59:57 2015 UTC,This is True.   Hopefully you're off of pelvic rest sooner rather than later
CautiousBB,3cevqa,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:03:30 2015 UTC,"I really hope so! Both for the being off pelvic rest bit, as well as getting that placenta to a safer spot. Odds are in my favor, but it is still worrisome until I know it has moved."
CautiousBB,3cevqa,knirbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:08:40 2015 UTC,Boo!! Are they giving you more frequent ultrasounds to see if/when it moves? I hope it gets out of the way quickly!!
CautiousBB,3cevqa,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:03:26 2015 UTC,Next ultrasound is in 5 weeks. Wish they'd do it more often. Maybe I can beg one at my next appointment in two weeks. Really hope it moves!
CautiousBB,3cevqa,septicidal,3,Tue Jul 7 12:07:19 2015 UTC,"Pooping all the time. I don't even know how my intestines have more in them. I stepped up the probiotics in hopes that helps.  Other than that, just chugging along. Two days away from the halfway point!

I'm pretty sure that just means he's dropped (36+5 today) but it coincided with the news that I'm GBS positive.  I'm terrified that I'm leaking fluid, and I'm Humira which suppresses the immune system of both mom and baby, and no one can tell me (not even the Internet) what GBS + Humira might mean.  I messaged the nurse practitioner and she was no help whatsoever.   I'm one frazzled mama.  I hope he's okay."

CautiousBB,3cevqa,edition,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"Just had my first OB appt at 8 weeks.  There was actually a baby in there!  Measuring at 8+2 with a hb of 173.  The office had a field day with the news after the initial confusion of them seeing my 36 week pregnant wife and wondering if she was the one with the appointment.  My wife even cried happy tears at the ultrasound.  I'm still in absolute shock (we began this journey over 6 years ago).  I had no feeling about the sex until today and now we're both going with girl, which would probably make it easier for our 5yo daughter to digest having two babies 5 mos apart with this one due 2 days before her birthday.  I'm super excited but mostly I just want to sleep..."
CautiousBB,3cdvt5,Monsterandmayhem,5,Tue Jul 7 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, but are you sure it's not sweat? I had a similar scare a few weeks ago. Turns out being pregnant has more disgusting side effects then I thought."

For now, you could put on a pad/liner and see if the fluid is clear or has a honey/yellow/brown look to it. My OB warned me that the latter signified possible fluid leaks. It will also smell sweet."

CautiousBB,3cdvt5,theanonymousdame,3,Tue Jul 7 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with your gut about whether to go into L&D, typically though an amniotic leak will increase with standing and bearing down (like when you pee) so it sounds not likely. Good luck!"
CautiousBB,3cdvt5,autumnx,2,Tue Jul 7 04:54:48 2015 UTC,I have the same concerns.  I'm going to swing by Walmart today and pick up some PH strips so I can test at home and ease my mind.
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,illogical_newt,3,Mon Jul 6 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"I am a carrier for cf as well.  It was hard for my husband to get tested because he had to go through his doctor who didn't know the proper blood test to order.  If you have this issue,  have your ob give you the codes to give to his doctor.   Until we received the results we decided that no matter what we would keep the baby.  That is the first decision to make.  While having a child with cf is hard,  it is much easier knowing before hand and we could get the proper doctors,  child care,  etc.  set up before he was born. We (I) try to make contingency plans when stressed.  Once a decision was made we concentrated on getting my husband tested.  The time goes surprisingly fast, especially when you are trying not to yell at nurses.    In the end my husband tests were negative and our son is now a healthy 8 month old.  I hope your husband tests are negative too."
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,Aelfgifu,3,Tue Jul 7 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"Somehow my husband and I are both carriers for a genetic disorder (with a 1/4 chance the baby would have it, just like you guys) - we found out he was one after moving forward with testing after I found out I was a carrier. We chose to do an amnio after learning more about this disorder (usually not compatible with life) and it took five weeks for the results of that to come back.  To pass the time, we watched a ton of Netflix - The Good Wife especially. I read mindless things online, tried to dive into work, etc. Most people did not know (I hadn't shared the pregnancy with work yet) and that was really nice for me - I didn't want to talk about it all day.  It was rough for sure. No other advice aside from trying to keep your mind on other things as much as you can. While waiting for results, I didn't want to do anything or go anywhere, so holing up with TV was a nice distraction.   I hope you get negative results back soon! Like you said, the odds are definitely in your favor. I know its agony waiting to find out if you have a healthy baby. Thinking of you!"
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,givingsomefs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, waiting for the results just makes me want to mindlessly pass the time. I'm glad I'm not the only one with that approach. Thanks for your words!"
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,brittpotter,3,Tue Jul 7 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"Like other posters just BC your a carrier doesn't mean baby will have it.   Just from personal experience: treatments/meds for cystic fibrosis has come a long way since years ago. My husbands cousin who is 11 has it. He is amazing. Is basically like any other 11 year old. Yes he does his breathing treatments, takes enzymes prior to eating anything but it's a much more live able disease then it was years ago. I've gone to a few events for cystic fibrosis and have come across people in there mid 50's who are doing really well."
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,GottaGetToIt,3,Tue Jul 7 01:15:02 2015 UTC,"Expressed differently your kid had a 0.0086 chance of having it if I did my math right.  Not bad odds.  And CF can range a lot in severity.  Some kids will be very ill.  Some people aren't even diagnosed until they are in the 40s because their symptoms are so mild.  I knew a guy who we diagnosed in his 40s after a sperm analysis showed funky semen.  (men with CF often have fertility problems,  the women usually don't).    Best of luck!"

CautiousBB,3ccfzr,natural_seattleite,2,Tue Jul 7 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"Simply being a carrier does not mean your kid is going to have CF, as you know. Try to just let it go until you get more information. When you're pregnant, all you really want to do is jump ahead but you can't. Even if your kid does have it, the steady “aging” of the CF population reflects the remarkable progress that has been made in understanding and treating CF. Just don't jump ahead. I went through genetic testing and completely ignored the results until everything was gathered. My MFM then sat down with us and discussed our results, which were normal."
CautiousBB,3ccfzr,bitterred,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:04:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, first it was ""just need to get through the first ultrasound."" Now it's ""just need to get through the results of this test."" But you're right, then it's going to be something else. Need to try to let it go."

I know they're super excited, but by the end, honestly, I was just nodding and agreeing while being completely tuned out. I probably accidentally agreed to name my child after some obscure relative and didn't even realize it. I texted my best friend after we were finally on our way home and said that I didn't want to talk about the baby or being pregnant ever again.   With in-laws, I didn't say anything, because I knew they would think I was being ""snappy."" I probably wouldn't have said anything to family friends either. But had it been my own family, I definitely would have said, ""ok, let's spend ten minutes talking about my career/friends/hobbies/dog/hair/anything else."" I mean, sometimes it's just TOO MUCH."
CautiousBB,3cd79y,crankerpants,2,Tue Jul 7 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"I feel you. For us it's the future baby comments. Like you know what we went through to get pregnant, thinking about gender this soon in the game is naive."

I'm 25 weeks now and showing for all the world to see, I hate having strangers know something so intimate to me and making comments, asking questions. I like to not be noticed, all of that is apparently out the window. All conversations end up about the pregnancy/baby, I'm starting to forget what people used to converse with me about.

CautiousBB,3cb2lz,schwarzhasi,3,Mon Jul 6 14:53:17 2015 UTC,I'm also a super smeller and like to keep a makeup pad soaked with peppermint oil in my scrub pockets- it's easy enough to grab and strong enough that it helps with smells for a while. I know a lot of other hospital workers that do Vicks vapor rub under their nose to help with blocking scents.  Good luck!
CautiousBB,3cb2lz,Tinyprogeny,2,Mon Jul 6 21:26:40 2015 UTC,Oh wow those are both good tips. I'm going to have to look into those!
CautiousBB,3cb2lz,Tomkhagai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:07:39 2015 UTC,Vicks sounds brilliant. I also clutch Kleenex Eucalyptus Oil tissues everywhere I go (do they have them where you are?)

CautiousBB,3cb2lz,Sharra_Blackfire,5,Sat Jul 11 07:01:43 2015 UTC,"Yes! I keep thinking it will let up, but at 12 weeks, the sniffer has breached into superhuman territory. I was gagging today in a work seminar when the girl in front of me kept fanning her face with a pamphlet, blowing her smell directly in my face. She didn't stink per say, but definitely did not smell freshly-bathed. I need to just keep some scented oils or something like that with me at all times. It was all I could focus on, super distracting!   Edit: I also work in a hospital. Breathing through my mouth has been the only thing that works at times, though then I start picturing the stink molecules touching my tongue and go into mega gross-out mode. fml lol"
CautiousBB,3cb2lz,Bomber_Girl,2,Mon Jul 6 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"It'll ease up soon! In the meantime, you can do things like rub fresh rosemary on your face so you have a constant, soothing scent :)"

CautiousBB,3cb2lz,notantisocial,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:45:44 2015 UTC,Well I'd rather I had no symptoms yet if Im going to have to smell everything so well. Haha
CautiousBB,3cb2lz,Ironbornsuck,2,Tue Jul 7 06:06:33 2015 UTC,"My poor husband. Everything smells. If he hasn't freshly showered and brushed, something I used to really not care about.  Towels that have been used 2-3 times, some pants that maybe got left in the wash a bit too long. The kitchen sink is no longer a safe place to get sick. Even the car has a funny smell or washed tupperware.  The toilet has to be in a constant state of cleanliness to be sick in or the smell makes it worse. I have to stop I am gagging lol."

CautiousBB,3c9vxf,bamabunny,2,Mon Jul 6 06:10:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry.  I've had losses as well and this is my 4th pregnancy.  Some days I honestly do feel like my babies are a time bomb and I'll lose this one eventually too.  I thought it would go away after 12 weeks but I feel there's always something to worry about, and it feels like the worry will never end.  I hate it.  It's very difficult for some of us to be optimistic after loss, but this is a great community for support!  I really hope this is it for you.  Hang in there!"
CautiousBB,3c9vxf,Pregosaur,2,Mon Jul 6 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for understanding. I'm sorry that you do though.   I've been debating announcing it now or waiting it out until 13 weeks. The people that do know say I should announce. They tell me I have a right to be excited after everything I've been through,but then it almost feels like announcing would be jinxing myself in a way. This one really has been so different though.   I spotted off and on from about 3 weeks to 7 weeks, but it was all brown. Now it's just the normal pregnancy discharge. I've been nauseous, even got sick once, which I never even had nausea with the other two. I've had several food a versions. I've had cramps every day. My breasts are extremely tender. I'm constantly fighting taking a nap. This one seems perfectly normal in every way.   I just wish I could relax."
CautiousBB,3c9vxf,Grave_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:01 2015 UTC,"Do what will make you feel comfortable with announcing.  I hate the ""rule"" that you shouldn't announce until you are out of the first trimester (mainly because I had a miscarriage diagnosed at 13 weeks, when I should have been safe), but there's no rule that says you have to do it by X weeks, either.  Heck, I've known a couple of women who don't make a public announcement at all, and that's awesome too."
CautiousBB,3c9vxf,autumnx,2,Tue Jul 7 01:20:23 2015 UTC,"I announced at 15 weeks simply because that's when I felt comfortable (3 losses prior to having my daughter). For me, the whole ""bomb in my face"" feeling didn't go away until way after she was born. Try to enjoy your pregnancy. You will miss it one day."
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,3,Mon Jul 6 11:02:18 2015 UTC,"Damn you, reflux. I know it's only going to get worse, but I had bad reflux pre-pregnancy so things are just really bad now. I think a lot of my nausea is reflux-related. The worst is that I get this uncontrollable burping, which lately has morphed into throwing up at the back of my throat.  Aside from that, just waiting for another ultrasound on Wednesday to see if they can determine the sex. The baby was NOT giving up anything at my anatomy scan the week before last.  Oh, and my kitchen cabinets FINALLY shipped. These things better be amazing once they arrive..."
CautiousBB,3cag41,TheFinalFrontier47,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"I've been having nasty reflux, too :(. I was diagnosed with GERD prior to pregnancy and have been on Prilosec ever since - but unfortunately, it seems the preggo reflux is overwhelming the Prilosec. It really sucks, I feel for you."
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 14:31:43 2015 UTC,"My OB had me switch from Prilosec to Nexium (they're the same class of medication but there is more data available on the safety of Nexium during pregnancy) and also approved adding Zantac twice a day to the Nexium, which has made more improvement.  I would ask yours about doing that to get some additional relief.  I wish my OB had approved staying on Prilosec - it's available as a generic for SO much cheaper via Costco.  On the really bad days, I have Nexium plus Zantac when I get up (before eating), then Reglan (which may also help with GERD aside from the nausea/vomiting), then a second dose of Zantac a little before going to bed, then sugar-free Tums if the Zantac doesn't calm down the reflux enough to sleep."
CautiousBB,3cag41,TheFinalFrontier47,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know you could take Zantac in addition to another med. I just kind of assumed Prilosec was it. I've taken Zantac on its own, but it did jack shit, lol. I'll definitely ask about it if the reflux doesn't improve ... I'm going to make some lifestyle changes first, like making extra sure I stay away from trigger foods. Because I'm sure the doc will ask me to do that first before approving another med, haha. Thanks so much for the suggestion!"
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"Zantac is listed on the ""safe for pregnancy"" over-the-counter medication list my OB gave out with a welcome packet, she said I didn't need approval to take anything on that list as long as I followed the dosage instructions.  I only checked because I was concerned whether there would be a problem taking both the Nexium and Zantac at the same time.  Sleeping with extra pillows, so your chest is at an angle, may help a bit with reflux before bed, as well as having some Tums before bed.  I got the sugar-free ones just because A) I prefer the orange flavor of the sugar-free ones, and B) I try to avoid excess sugar when I can because of insulin resistance. Plus I don't feel so awkward chewing them after brushing teeth."

CautiousBB,3cag41,alfalfasprout,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:36:21 2015 UTC,Ugh I feel you on the uncontrollable burping and mini-throw ups that come with it. I then get an uncontrollable urge to cough or clear my throat and I know it's irritating for my coworkers and husband but I can't help it! Anyway I find Zantac really helps with at least preventing the back of my throat from burning after every burp.
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:34:00 2015 UTC,I'm on Nexium plus Zantac plus Reglan plus Tums.  Basically my OB is throwing everything safer-for-pregnancy at the nausea and reflux.  It does help but only to an extent - there's really only so much that can be done with pre-existing moderate to severe reflux that worsens during pregnancy.  This kid better have the best head of hair ever.
CautiousBB,3cag41,alfalfasprout,2,Mon Jul 6 14:42:34 2015 UTC,Damn. I found Tums to be beyond useless but maybe they'd help if I took it with the Zantac. I only had mild reflux before so I never took anything for it.
CautiousBB,3cag41,CrazySheltieLady,3,Mon Jul 6 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I have strep. Between morning sickness and possible strep (plus getting like 30 minutes total of sleep last night), I don't think I've ever been more miserable."
CautiousBB,3cag41,edition,3,Mon Jul 6 12:10:34 2015 UTC,My wife lost her mucus plug last Friday after three days of blood and has been contracting all weekend.  The babe is moving as much as usual but it looks like things are moving.  She'll be 36 weeks Thursday.  She wants to hold off until I'm out of my 1st trimester (8 weeks today) but we'll see how that works out. :)

I'm just worried and anxious, moreso than I've been since the first trimester.  I just want to keep my little one safe."
CautiousBB,3cag41,Grave_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"If you stay pregnant a while longer, see if they'll agree to retest you closer to your EDD.  Apparently GBS is something that can come and go, so if it's gone before you have babe, that will spare you the antibiotics.  They're really not too bad, though--you'll have an IV for fluids anyway."

Thankfully everything else was visible and looked good, but the OB ordered another scan just to recheck a few views and see if they can't get a better look between the legs.  The second scan is scheduled for the afternoon, so I plan to have something sugary beforehand in hopes the baby is feeling more acrobatic (and less modest!) on Wednesday."
CautiousBB,3cag41,TheFinalFrontier47,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Oh dear, I hope the next scan goes better for you! I've actually been kinda worried that they won't be able to see everything needed on the scan, partly just because I'm a worrier, lol, and partly because this baby seems incredibly active. I swear I feel him/her so much more than my first pregnancy at the same stage, and the last time I was at an appointment where they checked the heartbeat, it took forever because baby kept squirming away. I hoooope he/she is more cooperative tomorrow!"
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,2,Mon Jul 6 19:12:34 2015 UTC,"The tech said that active is actually good because they can more easily get different angles - they pause the image to take the detailed measurements.

I try to sleep on my side, and successfully do but somehow usually end up sleeping on my back which makes it really hurt when I get up in the morning.  Also yesterday was a good day but weird.  I started getting very weird stomach pain and tenderness and I felt my baby's movements were weaker.  I began to freak out because the pain was worse when I'd moved.  I was afraid of a placental abruption and was just about ready to call my OB and prep for the ER and decided I had to pee.  After I did the pain stopped almost instantly.  I also never bled which reassured me more.  Maybe this is more of a uti-related thing but I'm letting my OB know when I see him next week, that was unusual and terrifying.  I was already sobbing out of panic, it was ridiculous.  Her movements being weaker seem to have just been coincidence because she's fine now."
CautiousBB,3cag41,septicidal,3,Mon Jul 6 12:26:20 2015 UTC,"I would recommend calling about lower back pain, especially if you have had or currently have a UTI.  That can be a sign of kidney infection, which is very treatable but is best addressed as soon as possible.  I would not advise waiting until next week to get that checked out if it occurs again.  My OB has emphasized over and over that they would rather get a dozen calls about stuff that turns out to be nothing than not get the one call that turns out to be a serious issue.  As for movements feeling weaker, it is most likely just a combination of the baby shifting positions (so you're not feeling the same body parts in the same position, or the baby is pressing more against the placenta which dulls movements) and the baby getting bigger and having less room for huge, strong movements against the uterine walls.

I do have a problem with a uti (this will be my 5th one this pregnancy, it's ridiculous), but my back pain is more my sacrum and usually hurts when I'm getting up and out of bed."
CautiousBB,3cag41,tinameri,3,Mon Jul 6 23:43:06 2015 UTC,I've found that my pain always gets worse when I have a full bladder.  It took me a few days to correlate full bladder with increased pain but when it starts hurting more I've started with bathroom trips and it has helped.  Hopefully yours is nothing too serious but always good to check with your doctor about a possible uti.
CautiousBB,3cag41,Sharra_Blackfire,2,Mon Jul 6 22:43:41 2015 UTC,Did you eat anything weird that could have been responsible for the lower abdominal pain? :(
CautiousBB,3cag41,Pregosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"No, it was a weird stinging/burning pain that was pretty high up, on either side of my belly, so I knew it wasn't a food-related issue.  It was probably just a complication of a uti but I'll check in with my OB just to be sure :/"

We're too early to have told any friends yet so she didn't know, but it was torture having to walk by the delicious deliciousness all day. Then to be nice she left the leftovers with us and it's still in my fridge! Now I get to watch my hubby polish it off my favorite dessert food of all time while I nibble on clementines... Pure torture I tell you!"
CautiousBB,3cag41,aintnochickenwing,2,Mon Jul 6 16:51:40 2015 UTC,Would it be okay to at least have a few bites of it? I'd go mad having my fave dessert sitting in my fridge and not eating any of it.
CautiousBB,3cag41,Bomber_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"She was a little heavy handed on the rum, so I'm not sure how much would be ok. If you open the container there is a pretty intense aroma o'booze."

CautiousBB,3cag41,Grave_Girl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"I have an extreme aversion to vomiting, so I almost never do.  Like, everyone else in the family will get a stomach bug and throw up several times a day; I'll get one and just will not throw up.    Guess what I've been doing daily?  I know it's perfectly normal for most people, but for me it really isn't; I don't throw up unless I'm pregnant, and sometimes not even then.  I just go around feeling on the verge of it constantly.  Which sucks in its own way, but the throwing up is worse, because aversion.  And it reminds me of the last pregnancy in a very bad way even though I know that the vomiting didn't rupture the amnion and lead to the other issues, the monkeybrain doesn't know that.  The monkeybrain is all ""If you're throwing up this soon, something else bad is going to happen.""  Beyond that, the exhaustion has hit full force, which is bad 'cause I've got a half mile to walk to the bus stop any time I want to go somewhere, and kids who don't understand that Mommy now takes twice as long to make the walk.  I didn't get the chance to sit & rest on the way home and had that ""fun"" thing happen where your vision grays out and you almost fall over.  So, yay.  Six weeks."

Hahaha  I read the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy and that was incredibly informative without being too scary. If you haven't read it, I recommend it. You can buy the kindle version through amazon for instant gratification."
CautiousBB,3c9enu,ZenithFell,2,Mon Jul 6 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!!! How exciting :)  Most people have their first appointments ~8 weeks. I'd probably call your OB/midwife tomorrow morning so you have more of a selection to choose from for appointments.   For exercise, you can pretty much just keep doing what you're already doing! And if you've been doing nothing (like me... whoops) I'd suggest walking. I'm so tired that I can't really imagine doing anything more. My OB said I could do the elliptical or whatever for cardio if I wanted, as long as my heart rate stayed under 140bpm.   And for food... My OB has a pretty lax attitude. No raw meat, fish, or eggs. And no unpasteurized milk/cheese. Everything else in moderation is fine! Hell, they gave us our choice of Starbucks or Subway gift cards at Christmas last year.   I read What to Expect with my first pregnancy, and I'm hoping to get my hands on a copy of Expecting Better this time. I think it's more my vibe."
CautiousBB,3c9enu,bionerdgirl13,3,Mon Jul 6 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"Oh and I forgot to mention if you aren't already on a prenatal vitamin, now would be a good time to start! I take the NatureMade Multi Prenatal with a separate DHA supplement. I only do them separately because I'm a huge baby and the combo vitamin was gigantic and I couldn't get it down."
CautiousBB,3c9enu,bionerdgirl13,2,Mon Jul 6 04:33:26 2015 UTC,Thank-you for your reply!!  I presently dont have an OB or a Midwife here.

And yes Ive been taking a prenatal for about 4 months :)  Thank you again for the advice!!

CautiousBB,3c9enu,septicidal,3,Tue Jul 7 12:13:45 2015 UTC,"Most U.S. insurances don't require a referral for OB/GYN appointments, but you should call your insurance to check. If you need a referral, you'll need a primary care doctor to put the referral through.  As for choosing a midwife/OB: the advice I was given was to pick where you want to deliver and select a care provider that uses that hospital. If you want to go with a midwife/birthing center, ask them about how they deal with referring patients to OB/hospital care if something arises during pregnancy or labor.  As for everything else - use common sense, raw meats can be fine depending on preparation (sushi in the U.S. is required to be made with pre-frozen fish, which kills off the parasite that is of concern) and solid cuts of meat like steak that are seated on the outside are fine. Ground meats, poultry, and pork always need to be cooked through completely. Lunch meat should be heated to 120 degrees Fahrenheit before consuming.   Something some women overlook - greens/fruits/vegetables need to be washed thoroughly before preparing and consuming. The biggest E. coli outbreaks recently have been from poorly washed greens, and listeria was found in ice cream and hummus of all things.  Caffeine is fine in moderation. The current recommendation is 200mg a day, which is a medium coffee or a few cups of caffeinated tea (depending on how strongly it's brewed)."

CautiousBB,3c8bku,lubbys,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:37 2015 UTC,Poking mine usually gets their attention and stops whatever it was that they are doing.  I haven't had any punches to the cervix yet but one of my twins kicks me in the sternum constantly.  I've been able to get her to stop with a quick poke.
CautiousBB,3c8bku,cordsniper,2,Sun Jul 5 23:07:45 2015 UTC,"Try things that help her get into birthing position. I was getting kicked in the cervix until baby boy flipped at 35-36 weeks (procrastinator baby). I tried a few things from spinning babies. The most comfortable, easiest, and pain-relieving thing I did was to get on all fours and tuck my chin down, stick my butt up a little whenever he was really active. I felt like it gave him more room to move around and get comfortable. I also tried the breech inversion, but I think it's too early for you to do that and it was a horrid experience."
CautiousBB,3c8bku,bioengnerd,2,Mon Jul 6 12:40:49 2015 UTC,"I am due a week after you.  Same situation, she's a wiggly, kicking, flipping maniac. They still have a lot of room for another monthish, so they're acrobats. I will try switching sides if I am lying down, lie down if I am standing a lot, and tap on the bottom part of my uterus to get her to move up. Then she annoys my ribs instead for a while.  Good luck, the cervix kicks hurt!"
CautiousBB,3c8bku,megananimous,2,Wed Jul 8 13:34:57 2015 UTC,"Lol -- don't get pregnant! I don't have any advice for how to encourage polite behavior in your fetus; at this point I'd trade a lot just to have 3 good hours of non-sociopathic behavior from my 4-year-old.

I for once do,  because I've been through the same experience.  I was told I can't have a child without IVF and after years of trying we gave up and went with IVF. I got pregnant,  and our whole life changed.  We set up the nursery,  we put ourselves in parents mode.  I even got my husband a father day present for he's gonna become a father.  Unfortunately we lost the baby at 39 weeks due to unexplained placental abruption.    My baby was beautiful full term.  I held her in my arms and I couldn't believe she will never open her eyes.  She looked exactly like her dad just like I always wanted her to be.  That day broke me forever.  And i don't think I'll ever be the same.  I don't think I'll manage to love any more babies like I loved her.  I hate all moms with healthy children. I hate all pregnant women who go through a pregnancy like it's a walk in the park. I hate my nefews and nieces and can't manage to have a normal relationship with them.    Here I am pregnant again.  And there's no day that passes by that I don't worry about when something wrong is going to happen.  I'm detaching myself completely from the baby.  I try not to think about the whole issue.  I don't mention my pregnancy to anyone although obviously I'm showing. People understand I guess because what I've been through.   I try to take it one day at a time.  So far I've managed to get away with one ovarian torsion.  I hope my story helps you realize you're not alone dealing with this.  As angry as I was for my situation,  knowing that it does happen all the time helps release some of the anger I have.  I think we all need support in one way or the other.

So strong, in fact, that the doctor says I can get off the progesterone and estrogen. As you can probably guess, the pregnancy wasn't done in the bedroom. This was our first IVF. My husband's sperm can't fertilize an egg because they lack the enzyme to break through the shell, so we did a little forced introduction with ICSI. I have my second beta on Wednesday. With something like IVF, how do people calculate their week and day counts? Do you count from the egg retrieval or the transfer date? (We did a 5 day transfer.) What's neat is that I heard the news today, and today is my birthday."

CautiousBB,3c5qrk,AlbertaRagsnRiches,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:45:26 2015 UTC,I feel like our early bumps are more obvious to us than to others. We didn't announce until around 15 weeks and people were surprised- IDK if this tip helps but I wore things like high waisted skirts and tucked in shirts and it helped disguise the bloat. I feel like most young-ish people are tactful enough not to mention it if they suspect it... That said every time I saw my grandparents they insisted I was pregnant.  It's really hard though- I felt very protective of announcing the pregnancy.

Added mozzarella and black beans for protein. I dressed it with a simple mustard vinaigrette. I had a big bowl of it for lunch and dinner- for dinner, I added a bowl of strawberries. (92 1 hour for lunch, 106 for dinner.)  I desperately wanted berries and whipped cream last night but had to wait for shelf stable whip cream to cool down so i may have it for snack this morning- I sweeten the whipped cream with a touch of vanilla extract.

I had a powerful craving for seafood last night and so we went out for Cajun (I had scallops, crab, shrimp, and crawfish). Unfortunately, I was so tired and sick-feeling, I kinda ruined the date vibe for my husband :-( Also, I had a Granny Smith apple yesterday and it was AMAZING!

CautiousBB,3c1670,littleblueowl,9,Fri Jul 3 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"You can use whatever you feel is most accurate. Unless it's a difference if more than 5-7 days, the office won't change your due date. I know exactly when I conceived (fertility treatment) and at my NT scan the baby measured 2 days behind... My anatomy scan showed everything is fine and perfectly within normal ranges for my gestational age. Technically I'm telling everyone a due date one day before the IUI due date, because it's easier for me to just tell people ""Thanksgiving"". In the grand scheme of things, the due date doesn't mean a whole lot. It's a ballpark estimate and only something like 5% of babies are born on their due dates. The important thing is that testing is done at appropriate times, but a difference of a few days doesn't matter for the testing milestones (like NT scan, anatomy scan, etc.)."
CautiousBB,3c1670,septicidal,3,Fri Jul 3 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I've heard that those measurements are usually within a week, but not necessarily spot on.  However, I hear you with the Sunday turnover (it just makes calendar sense).  In my opinion 3 days doesn't matter very much."

CautiousBB,3c1670,kaceface,2,Sat Jul 4 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"The new ""rule"" in Canada is that a first-trimester ultrasound should be used for dating rather than the LMP whenever one is available. There was a new guideline published for obstetricians within the last year or so, but not everyone is up to date with this information. LMP dating is notoriously inaccurate, since (a) no woman has a perfect 28 day cycle, (b) many women cannot recall when their last period was, and (c) many women conceive on birth control or just after coming off it, which means that ovulation could have occurred at any time in the cycle. Accurate dating is super important, not just for booking a post-dates induction, but also for diagnosing intrauterine growth restriction and for determining whether a baby might survive at the limits of viability (ie. around 22-24 weeks) if the woman comes in with preterm labour for instance."

It made me feel more reassured even though it was just a mental thing. Then at some point I changed it back so I wouldn't be disappointed if I went into labor late. The doctors I've seen have always kept the original LMP due date."
CautiousBB,3c1670,sucumber,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:08:14 2015 UTC,"At 9ish weeks I measured three days behind my LMP, but one day ahead of my self-measured O date. My doc did acknowledge that the measurement was more accurate due to my slightly longer cycles, but since it was less than a week off of my LMP dating, she wasn't going to change my due date in their records.   Things change over time, too. Slight differences in growth rates and in how exactly the tech measures things can easily add or subtract a day. At my 18 week anatomy scan, the kid was measuring a day bigger than LMP dating. I wasn't too surprised since big babies run in both our families.  I use the 9 week measurement date for growth apps, but LMP due date for  countdown-to-baby tickers. Yes, plural because I'm an obsessive FTM."

CautiousBB,3c1670,cheddarkitty,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"With our daughter, the ultrasound measured her 6 days ahead of my LMP date. My doctors didn't change my due date on file but I stuck with the ultrasound date. She arrived 5 days earlier than that date or 11 days earlier than the LMP date. I tend to think my ultrasound was closer to accurate because she was a good weight and well suited to being born when she was.   With this current baby, the ultrasound measured it 3 days behind my doctors calculation of my LMP and 5 days behind mine. I came straight off birth control and got pregnant (and got pregnant on the second cycle with our daughter) so I don't know for sure how long my cycles are. Default is 28 days which makes the LMP date January 20, my doctor measured off 30 day cycles which makes it January 22, and the ultrasound puts us at January 25. In this case we decided to split the difference and use January 22.   Like others have said it's not really important until you are talking about a possible induction. Where I live you basically have to get an induction at 10 days over. So I'm comfortable using our middle ground date which would give us between 7 and 12 days overdue depending on who's date you use."
CautiousBB,3c1670,sbrib,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:22:02 2015 UTC,Those ultrasound measurements are not accurate to the day.  I know exactly when I conceived because it was IVF.

He told me the 7w ultrasound was right on time with what I said. He had already talked about how lmp can only be accurate if you have a textbook cycle anyways so he doesn't like it. He's a PCOS specialist so I guess he gets a lot of women with lmp dates off. At the hospital I hadmy 2nd scan and when I registered to midwife I told them my lmp and my dating from ultrasound. They accepted the ultrasound date as that should be more accurate. I am abouta week off from my lmp. Lets see what they say at 12w.

They don't say whether or not the baby has a problem, just that additional tests might be helpful, which I think isn't communicated well enough to patients.  My philosophy is the more data, the better. It's easier for me to have concrete data than ""what ifs"". I felt a lot of relief once I had the NT scan and then the blood work also came back low risk, but prior to that I constantly reminded myself that whether or not there is a chromosomal issue is completely out of my control, it was already determined at fertilization. The wait is just for me to know what has already happened. That and reminding myself that the vast majority of pregnancies result in healthy babies. My baby already beat the odds stacked against it (5th and possibly final medicated cycle, IUI with a 5-7% success rate) so I know percentages/odds really don't mean much. Either everything will be fine or it won't, and if it isn't I have a good medical team and support system that will see me through it.  I don't think there's anything wrong with acknowledging that things don't always turn out well. But agitating yourself over it isn't good for anyone. I spent most of the earlier parts of pregnancy focused on projects and things completely unrelated to pregnancy. It helped in a way that my office was short staffed at my busiest time of year, so work kept me very occupied, and at home I've been working on a kitchen renovation where I have been the designer and we are not using a general contractor, so we are coordinating all the details and subcontractors ourselves. (Not only is it saving thousands of dollars, I get an all-immersive project out of it... Though I will be glad once it is over!)  It may help to step away from searching for all the information. All the statistics in the world can't give you data about your pregnancy, only your medical providers and time will be able to do that."

And why on Earth is he already talking about an amnio?  It's invasive, carries a risk of miscarriage, and there are other options that don't have those issues.    I'm a big believer in midwifery care; I've had my last two babies with a nurse-midwife practice and will be going back to them this time around too.  Midwifery care in general is very woman-positive.  But even if you are more comfortable with a doctor, it needs to be a doctor with whom you are actually comfortable, not this dude."

Condescending is an immediate nope out of there. One lesson I have learned this past year is that these doctors are not there to help you. They just want you to do as instructed.  There's no reason to be pushing an amino right now... Jesus.  Our doctor was very open about it as an option but that we should discuss it as a couple and she recommended it as an option only if other concerns presented.  We had an actual conversation... not a lecture at all. I would have just walked out of an appointment if it was like OP's."

But ignoring your partner when you clearly want him included? No way, not cool. Your husband is just as much a part of this as you are. Perhaps a serious talk with your OB is in order?

Are there other practices that might work for you?  I'm really happy with my OB and she and her team have been very responsive and supportive. They also made it clear that partners/support people are very welcome at appointments, though due to work my husband only had come for the initial appointment and my ultrasounds so far. The OB and nurse made a point to ask both of us if we had additional questions, and weren't condescending at all. They have also been wonderfully accommodating after it turns out I get bad rashes from the standard conductive gel they use for the Doppler and ultrasounds, and found an alternative that doesn't irritate my skin. Other doctors could have brushed off my complaints but they took me very seriously and made sure the information was highlighted on my record so anyone who sees me there or in labor and delivery knows what alternative to use.  I think it sounds like you would be very unhappy if you stayed with this OB. There will be someone better out there, and trust your gut. When you call to say you're switching practices and want records sent to a new place, tell them it's because you felt that your partner wasn't welcome at appointments and the OB didn't view you as an active participant in your care."
CautiousBB,3by8ig,septicidal,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:15:32 2015 UTC,I think it's just him. I think he is the practice. In his welcome letter he makes a big thing about how he takes on fewer paitents to give more one on one care although there is one other OB who might deliver if he's with another paitent. It was kinda weird. I felt like I was being auditioned as a girlfriend more than a paitient.

One thing to be aware of is that when they check for varicella (chicken pox), vaccine induced immunity will NOT show up in bloodwork. But you still have protection if you received two doses of the vaccine 30 days apart. It's on the CDC webpage about the vaccine. It kept coming up in my bloodwork that I didn't have varicella immunity, even after getting two more doses of the vaccine... I have now gotten the vaccine five times. Once at age 11, when the vaccine was brand new, then two more doses at age 17/18 because the new recommendations indicated two doses were necessary to provide better immunity. And then two more doses in 2014 because the OB/GYN was unaware that it doesn't show up on bloodwork and insisted that I get the sequence of two doses.  TL;DR: You can get bloodwork to check for many of the major vaccine-induced immunities (like rubella, etc.) but if they do the test for chicken pox it only shows positive for immunity if you actually had chicken pox and not the vaccine. Most doctors don't know this - I had to print off the page from the CDC website and highlight it, along with my vaccination records, to get my RE to stop harping about it."
CautiousBB,3bxoe2,septicidal,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:40:14 2015 UTC,Wow. I'm really lucky I guess. I'm immune to chicken pox somehow on my own.  Confirmed it like 5 times over the years now with blood work.
CautiousBB,3bxoe2,k2p2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:49:25 2015 UTC,You probably had a mild case that wasn't identified as actual chicken pox. I was exposed several times before vaccination but never contracted it.
CautiousBB,3bxoe2,k2p2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:01:27 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear this :( I hate needles. Hope you're okay. I know I have to get a certain vaccine at about 27 weeks (whooping cough?) but hadn't thought of any others. I see my midwife Monday so I'll check with her what I should have :) good luck with your jab!
CautiousBB,3bxoe2,Grave_Girl,2,Fri Jul 3 04:22:07 2015 UTC,Lol. It's my own stupid fault really. I'm amazed at how I stabbed myself with tweezers that were on a counter and I wasn't even using them.

CautiousBB,3bx1ym,lancealittle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"After 8 hours at the hospital diagnosis is subchorionic hemorrhage. For a small town hospital the Dr was thorough and very swamped last night. Ultrasound showed gestational sac, yolk sac, and what they think is 2 mm fetal pole putting us at 6w0d. I think we're supposed to be a few days shy if that so that seems good. No fetal heart sounds yet. Beta was good and his exam showed cervix is closed, no tissue and bleeding was stopped. Keeping my fingers crossed."

CautiousBB,3bx1ym,Semirelatednonsense,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:25:35 2015 UTC,Radiologist who liked at my ultrasound noted what he thinks is a subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding stopped on its own and everything else looks okay. I'm hoping it resolves itself without bleeding again!

CautiousBB,3bx1ym,ivf_lizz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:09:12 2015 UTC,Thanks. Dr said first trimester bleeding is common and usually resolves itself. Blood work and pelvic exam were good.

CautiousBB,3bw2jp,mrsbiggern,3,Thu Jul 2 16:57:28 2015 UTC,Numbers just have to double. Was your ONLY HCG 136? You need it taken again to see what the numbers are. She should have emphasized that to you. Useless worrying.
CautiousBB,3bw2jp,autumnx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Yes, this was my first and only test.  I will go back in next week to see how the numbers are increasing."
CautiousBB,3bw2jp,autumnx,4,Thu Jul 2 18:36:03 2015 UTC,I'd honestly be mad at her. That's unnecessary. She's reacting to something that isn't definitive. It just needs to double. Ignore it until you go back and try to enjoy yourself.
CautiousBB,3bw2jp,Arrowmatic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, good.  I thought it was a little inappropriate of her too, so it makes me feel better that I wasn't just overreacting.  Thanks for your advice."

CautiousBB,3bvktv,Bomber_Girl,6,Thu Jul 2 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of things that could be happening!  Not every test will have as dark a line, it actually varies depending on that specific test (even in the same brand/package!) Even the fancy hospital ones do the same thing.  Also, when HCG gets to a certain level, there's something called a ""hook effect"" where the test can't read the HCG as well (my scientific explanation sucks). Try diluting your pee with a little water and see what happens!  Of course, the best thing to do is to speak to your health care provider, because there are other things that could be causing it. Stay positive though!"
CautiousBB,3bvktv,Cyndragosa,2,Thu Jul 2 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"So I just tried this after drinking a ton of water and the line is much darker now! That is so weird! Thanks for the tip, no more tests for me."

CautiousBB,3bvktv,autumnx,2,Thu Jul 2 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't only have to worry about bleeding . Last year we had a MC at 9 weeks, but according to the ultrasound we had most likely MCed at 5-6 weeks and I never had any bleeding, cramps, or other symptoms. We were supposed to see a heartbeat and instead we didn't see anything, not even a pole.  It was a totally out of the blue, so I'm pretty inclined to worry about anything and everything... haha.   I will stop taking the tests though, you are right. No reason to be freaking myself out any more than need be I suppose."

CautiousBB,3buzmc,Semirelatednonsense,2,Thu Jul 2 12:20:42 2015 UTC,They feel a little different than regular cramps. Almost like I need to use the restroom or it's in my lower stomach or lower back.

Baby was moving around a lot while Dr was trying to get her heartbeat but everything is looking good still so far! I also got the OK to dye my hair, which I wasn't too concerned about initially but wanted to ask more for peace of mind. So I can finally make a hair appt wooooo!! Can't wait.  I've gained 6lbs since my last appointment 4 weeks ago :/ but, at my last appt the doctor said I was about 5lbs behind with the weight gain they like to see by the midway point so I guess it's good that I'm catching up. I'm nervous to take my GD test in 2 weeks though!"
CautiousBB,3buzmc,rpsychnurse,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:50:46 2015 UTC,I ate ice cream after work to make myself feel better and now I feel worse because I shouldn't have eaten ice cream. Boo!  I just want to go on maternity leave already- my job is really exhausting me and I'm not sure if I can do three more months!
CautiousBB,3buzmc,EriApples,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:25:19 2015 UTC,6 weeks today and barely any symptoms still. Trying not to freak out. Still trying not to freak out..... Don't have a doctors appointment for another week and I don't get a dating scan... typical as I have fairly regular periods and well Australian public system..don't want to do stuff unless they have to. So unless something unusual comes back in my blood I don't get to see the baby until 12-14 weeks. So long.
CautiousBB,3buzmc,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:47:50 2015 UTC,"My symptoms have disappeared!! I hit 6 weeks tomorrow.  I had tons of cramping, heavy/sore breasts, some nausea, unusual discharge.  Over the past 3 days everything is gone. My nipple are just the teenist bit sensitive if I touch them.  My stress is real right now. I am going insane."
CautiousBB,3buzmc,meepmeep1357,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:04 2015 UTC,"Just had my eyes checked, and there's no improvement - I have central serous retinopathy in one eye due to pregnancy, and I'd thought it was getting better, but apparently it isn't, and my vision in that eye is actually getting worse.    Fortunately, this is a self-limiting condition that goes away a few months after childbirth, but it's still a nuisance."
CautiousBB,3btm2k,thetrufeisoutthere,5,Thu Jul 2 01:20:08 2015 UTC,There's still hope! Mine didn't start to let up until after 20 weeks and didn't go away completely until week 23. My midwife said for some people it doesn't start to ease until the second half of pregnancy. I'd totally resigned myself to 9 months of sickness.

CautiousBB,3btm2k,speaksincolor,3,Thu Jul 2 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"Mine got briefly worse at around weeks 15-16. I went from feeling moderately nauseated all day to actively gagging at just about everything, but then it eased off just as quickly as it peaked."

At this point, I'm almost USED to throwing up! I've heard from quite a few women that 20 weeks can be the magic number for FINALLY feeling better. I'm banking on that for now!"
CautiousBB,3bsshl,Semirelatednonsense,3,Wed Jul 1 21:19:32 2015 UTC,I feel like that hcg is really high for 9 dpo. Mine was only 228 on like 16+/-dpo.
CautiousBB,3bsshl,dizzyvonblue,2,Wed Jul 1 21:30:23 2015 UTC,I'm reading that it varies widely apparently but as long as it doubles it's good? Charts that show the normal ranges are crazy alllllll over the place!
CautiousBB,3bsshl,dizzyvonblue,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:36:38 2015 UTC,Right. I saw one chart and it had like 5 as a normal number. Rising numbers is what counts.
CautiousBB,3bsshl,whatgoesup56,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:44:56 2015 UTC,You've got it.   Numbers vary all over the place.
CautiousBB,3bsshl,Grave_Girl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there is a pretty huge range of normal when you're early.  It's the rise that matters, more than the exact number."
CautiousBB,3bsshl,La_plant,3,Thu Jul 2 03:08:18 2015 UTC,That is perfectly fine! There's a huge range for hCG and you're safely within normal.  Doubling time is what matters most!
CautiousBB,3bsshl,thesnugglypuppies,2,Thu Jul 2 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"I got a positive test 2 weeks ago, and did a beta right after... it was at 13.5. A week later, I was at 72.5. One week later (yesterday) I was at 1020!"

CautiousBB,3bscw8,Tinyprogeny,4,Wed Jul 1 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Have you been checked recently for a UTI? The urgency to pee with very little coming out is a classic sign and they very common in pregnancy.  That aside, having white noise helps me a lot with sleeping. Exercising a few hours before bed (walks before or after dinner are a good low impact exercise) may help.  The dry mouth could be from breathing through your mouth - have you tried a neti pot to clear out congestion? It's helped me."
CautiousBB,3bscw8,septicidal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"No UTI fortunately and we use a white noise machine (our neighbor is learning to play the accordion, oh my!). I tried a humidifier last night- I hate Neti pots and have always been a mouth breather. Thanks for the advice!"
CautiousBB,3bscw8,speaksincolor,2,Thu Jul 2 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"I'm at almost 33 weeks and my sleep has been super iffy off and on for most of the pregnancy. :( Right now I can't get cool enough, and I have to pee at least 5x per night. The snoogle got way too hot for me as soon as May rolled around.   No real tips - I just grab sleep when I can and crankily do without the rest of the time. :("

CautiousBB,3bscw8,TemporalParietal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:45:57 2015 UTC,I've had the Snoogle for a month already- I love snuggling with it on the couch but sleeping on it causes hip and knee pain for me. Thanks!
CautiousBB,3bscw8,panandacub,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:49:06 2015 UTC,Just how DO you use a pillow for your head along with the snoogle?
CautiousBB,3bscw8,panandacub,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"I have a very thin pillow (at least, it is thin compared to what I usually like). It sits on top of the top curve of the snoogle--the more sharply rounded one. For me, it puts my neck at the right height. A snoogle alone was too low."
CautiousBB,3bscw8,theMstates,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Snoogle did not work for me at all! It made my ear hurt from being firm and I would sweat even in the winter in RI, there's no way I could use it in the summer in CA! At 29 weeks, I can say there are really good weeks of sleeping well and then weeks where I sleep like crap the whole week. You could try your nightly routine on the couch (that's one of those classic treating your insomnia things, might not hurt to try at least). Have you thought about essential oils? When I was sick with my head cold (x2), lavendar helped with sleep and peppermint helped with congestion!"

CautiousBB,3brpvk,GeLioN,8,Wed Jul 1 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"I've had probably 10+ internal ultrasounds at the same hospital and only once did a tech have me insert it myself. Maybe it's their personal preference. Maybe they feel weird putting it in you. If so, they should get a different job haha."
CautiousBB,3brpvk,evemachine,3,Wed Jul 1 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I find that odd.  My first appointment, the tech inserted it and in previous ultrasounds, the tech had inserted it.  Guess each doctor office is different."

CautiousBB,3brpvk,simplysarah,8,Wed Jul 1 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"I've always had the opposite! They always insert for me but with plenty of warning.

""I'm inserting the wand now'   OKAY I GET IT. PUT THE DAMNED THING IN MY LADY BITS ALREADY."
CautiousBB,3brpvk,ReigningPotatoes,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:03 2015 UTC,"I've had two and they inserted it both times. With excessive amounts of warning, just like yours did! We all know what's happening here, get on with it!  Also, is it wrong that I noticed that the female tech had to move it around a bit to get it in whereas the male one got it in super-smoothly first try?"
CautiousBB,3brpvk,crapeau,3,Wed Jul 1 22:57:55 2015 UTC,It's for their legal safety.   That you're not u comfortable with another person putting a forgien object into your vagina.   Also you know your vagina what will hurt etc.   I had a male ultrasound tech for my first ultrasound same thing I had to insert it.

CautiousBB,3brpvk,digitabulist,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"I went through a year of transvaginal ultrasounds with fertility treatments, sometimes multiple per week. Some of these were done in the special ultrasound office (where they do all the imaging), and those were the ones where they asked me to insert it myself. I think it's because you're dealing with an ultrasound tech vs. an OB/GYN."
CautiousBB,3brpvk,PancakesForTurtles,2,Wed Jul 1 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"I've had a couple transvaginal ultrasounds and they made me insert it myself. I'm not entirely sure why, but it didn't bother me any."
CautiousBB,3brpvk,Ironbornsuck,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:05 2015 UTC,I had one at the hospital then my OB did one a little bit later. I stupidly made the comment to my OB that he was so much more gentle than the tech. Oy.
CautiousBB,3brpvk,reidiate,2,Wed Jul 1 21:13:43 2015 UTC,At my OB office their tech has always had me do it myself. I guess I had never really thought about it before!

To me inserting something into your self while someone watches on is so more awkward than them just doing it to me. It's almost like they're trying to say there's something wrong with them doing it, like its sexual, only really its so medical and impersonal it really isn't."

After that I was with RE offices and, well, it's over faster if they just do it and at that point you do not care in the slightest. I have had to have ultrasounds on my heaviest period days. It's unpleasant for everyone but the techs at fertility clinics are used to it (or they damn well should be)."
CautiousBB,3brpvk,La_plant,2,Thu Jul 2 00:39:05 2015 UTC,They have always had me insert in the 3 I have gotten. I like that better much less resistance and less painful than someone else shoving it up there.
CautiousBB,3brpvk,rcrumbsinmybed,2,Thu Jul 2 01:44:47 2015 UTC,I had to insert mine and honestly I was really grateful.  She said it was because I could guage my comfort better than her.

CautiousBB,3brixs,thefatladysingeth,7,Wed Jul 1 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't have to do a sex reveal.  You can well say ""Well, we know which we're having, but we've chosen not to share the news.""  I've known several people to do just that.  One of the reasons I don't find out sex before birth is it gives me a break in the aggressive gendering of my kids.  (It's an entirely different sort of horror for boys, I have discovered.)  You'll get some blow back ""Oh, I have to know what you're having so I know what to buy!"" but the truth is that absolutely no baby gear is operated by your baby's genitals, and so there's no real difference in what can be bought.  As far as letting them have their fun...Well, my mother-in-law keeps sending or bringing over boxes of stuff and I keep saying thanks and then weeding out the stuff I won't let my daughters wear once she's gone.  Once a gift is given to you, it is yours to do with as you please (this is an etiquette thing); you're not under any obligation to do a thing other than be gracious.  You don't have to use it, you don't even have to keep it.  If you think your wishes will be respected, by all means say ""I'm not really into the frilly girly stuff for my daughter"" and hope they listen.  If they don't, pass it on."
CautiousBB,3brixs,Grave_Girl,2,Wed Jul 1 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"Very fair point. I'm still debating not telling anyone, although I'm debating that against my sanity given that this is our first, the first grandchild and the first great-grandchild on both sides. We're under a bit of a microscope right now.    Mother has already started in on sending clothes, but since she doesn't know boy/girl yet, she's sending clothes for me instead. I've already had to institute yes and no categories for those, I'll just have to expand them for LO. Grace and patience will be the keys, I think. Thanks for your thoughts."
CautiousBB,3brixs,Nesting_Hen,6,Wed Jul 1 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that you're already thinking about making sure she's her own person and worrying about ways to help her grow up strong and independent shows that you're on the right track!  Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it too much at this point. My mom heavily pushed frilly girly pink things on me but I ended up hating pink/Barbie/etc. And when I was old enough to have a choice, she usually let me choose. That's important too. And just because someone likes frilly girly things doesn't mean that they're also NOT a strong independent girl.   So if you wanted, you could always tell people that you don't want pink things or that you're trying to stay more gender neutral, (which is what I plan on doing if I have a girl), I also wouldn't be too worried or upset when someone inevitably gives you a pink tutu dress or a Barbie castle.   You'll be a great mom! :)"
CautiousBB,3brixs,travel_and_champagne,3,Wed Jul 1 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"It's also funny to see things go the opposite way, at least for now. My sister-in-law has been trying to raise my niece very gender neutral-- encouraging her that colors are for everyone, avoiding too much pink, watching the language she uses in terms of what she praises, giving her a variety of types of toys, etc. Recently my niece has turned super girly in some of her preferences and always wants to wear pink dresses and be a princess. She still likes science and figuring out how things work, too. I'm sure she'll still grow up to be a very independent minded and smart young lady. It's just funny to see her end up in hyper girly land even with my SIL steering her the opposite direction.   So, for the OP, I wanted to support the fact that your girl will be smart, independent, and strong even if she wears pink or plays with girly toys. What's more important is your encouragement and love."
CautiousBB,3brixs,epiclady,2,Wed Jul 1 16:20:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your support. Love and encouragement I can promise!    Part of what I'm most excited about is finding out who she is - how she's like me, how she's like DH and how she's not like either of us at all. And if she wants to be every princess in the Disney catalogue, then so be it; I will try to make sure she has a choice to make in the first place. :)"
CautiousBB,3brixs,tinameri,3,Wed Jul 1 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the vote of confidence! And oof, I hadn't even thought about a Barbie castle yet...    I like the idea of letting people know we're trying to stay more neutral in colors. We're already painting the nursery neutral colors so we'll be registering for things that match. Hopefully that will send some subliminal messages as well.    And thank you for the good reminder - pink/frilly/etc. does not discount strength or independence!"
CautiousBB,3brixs,FunnyLittleDuck,7,Wed Jul 1 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Pink is my favorite color, so my little girl is wearing pink (and blue and everything else). My rule is nothing that says ""cute"" ""adorable"" ""pretty"" etc or anything that implies she is flirty. My baby is a baby and is wonderful without all that. I read an article that said 80% of girls clothes with words had nouns while boys had verbs. Description over action. My daughter is not just a noun. She's a baby girl with a very nerdy mother. That's the message my little girls clothes will have lol.  I found a onesie that says ""my favorite princess is xena"" and that may be the coolest thing ever. Also one that says ""my mother isn't raising a princess she's training a Valkyrie"". These may or may not have made me squeal for way too long."
CautiousBB,3brixs,FunnyLittleDuck,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"I love your rules. Simple and clear. What an interesting statistic as well, and not terribly surprising. Here's to raising girls more interested in verbs and adjectives/nouns!  And don't get me wrong - I love pink too (have it on today, in fact). However, it's a reality that my room at home is still decorated with pink and white flowers...    Also, I'm just going to leave this here for you."
CautiousBB,3brixs,shadowfaxian,4,Wed Jul 1 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"I felt this exact moment when we told everyone we were having a girl.  6 people immediately started calling her princess and it took every ounce of tact to not blow up.    Like the others have said,  the fact that you are conscious of it makes you ten steps ahead. If my little girl happens to love pink I will support her,  if she prefers green,  even better. I think sometimes we get too overwhelmed with trying to be gender neutral. It's about balance.  She can have dolls and still love building things.    I have the same fears as you about passing my insecurities onto her,  but at the end of the day she will be her own person.  Hopefully a well balanced one. You're not alone in your thoughts,  we're all just doing the best we can."
CautiousBB,3brixs,shadowfaxian,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. I think DH and I might both have a hard time holding back if ""princess"" becomes the default nickname upfront. We haven't decided on a name yet, but Princess is probably not in the running.    Thank you for the reminder about balance. I think you are completely right, and I don't want to go so overboard with neutrality that I keep her from enjoying anything pink or ""girly."" That's a great reminder to keep myself in check through this process.    Clearly, I'm struggling inside my own head here. You echo something my dad has always told me - ""you make the best decision you can at the time."" I think it's the same sentiment as doing your best. Thanks."
CautiousBB,3brixs,septicidal,2,Wed Jul 1 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"We don't know the gender of our child yet, but I am already struggling with almost these exact feelings. My MIL wanted a daughter so badly, and she never had one. I feel like if she gets a granddaughter she is going to push the super pink/frilly/princess crap. Ultimately that is not my style, and even though friends/family may choose to gift us those types of things it doesn't mean I have to use them. You can politely accept all the stuff they give and then pick what items you want, and give the rest away to charity."
CautiousBB,3brjd9,Nesting_Hen,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"I have had 0 symptoms! I'm still super early (two days short of 5w), but I have had absolutely no indication that I'm actually pregnant other than the absence of ol' AF.

I'm hoping this isn't the start of ""morning sickness"", as I thought I had a few more weeks before that kicks in! Right now I don't even know what to do with myself. I went to a family event this morning and put lox on my plate, only to realize I don't think I can eat lox! I feel like I need a cheat sheet of all the things I can't have anymore and why. (also yes, I have read expecting better... But maybe it deserves a reread!)   Is it ridiculous that I want to pee test every day until my first ob appointment on the 21st?!"

CautiousBB,3brjd9,schwarzhasi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:04:54 2015 UTC,At least we don't have to wait until they are darker than the control line to confirm pregnancy - like ovulation tests. That would be even more torture!

I was also told to have some caffeine every day to help prevent them.  Benadryl is also safe to take and some migraine sufferers have reported that helping."
CautiousBB,3bqeaq,septicidal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:12:49 2015 UTC,You can take panadol/tylenol. What usually helps your migraines? Some people find a strong cup of coffee helps them so you could try that safely. I'd avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen if possible (even though you don't yet share a blood supply with the baby I'd still be reluctant to take it if panadol/caffeine worked).
CautiousBB,3bqeaq,summersintheair,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:28:46 2015 UTC,Panadol/caffeine doesn't work.

If I didn't know...I wouldn't know.  Every pregnancy is different & I count myself incredibly lucky to be having such an easy time of it. I've got a friend, also pregnant, who is having such a rough time!   So, I think we're just a couple of symptomless lucky ladies :)"

My boobs and/or nipples hurt on-and-off, but nothing consistent. I have been having some pinchy/stretchy cramps, but I don't notice them if I'm otherwise distracted. Otherwise, if it weren't for the lack of period and positive pregnancy tests, I wouldn't even know I was pregnant. I keep wondering if I'll get more symptoms. It's helpful to hear of other people having healthy pregnancies with few symptoms, because it's been worrying me."
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,CrazySheltieLady,3,Wed Jul 1 01:13:21 2015 UTC,6w4d and pretty much symtomless. My MIL told me she found out she was pregnant at 12 weeks because of irregular periods. No other symptoms. We're the lucky ones! (I just hope I stay lucky as it's still early days for me!)

I didn't have morning sickness...gagged once at the smell of broccoli in the microwave at work, felt mildly queasy a couple times. My boobs hurt a couple times, but not constantly or anything. Somewhere around 12-14 weeks my back started to hurt a bit, I got a snoogle and that took care of it.   Honestly, now I'm just bragging, but all in all this pregnancy thing has been mostly pleasant so far. Baby boy kicks me all the time these days, so I'm confident everything's going well, but at least in my case a lack of symptoms has not been worrisome. Just a lucky surprise. Try not to worry. :)"

I still get worried now especially since the teeny tiny symptoms I did have are gone. I can stay up past 10 pm now lol. But no symptoms may just mean you are not the type who will get sick. I get it though,  especially if you experienced a loss previously it can be worrisome. Good luck :)"

Occasional appetite changes, a few pimples, and I sleep longer (but I'm also on holiday). I'm pretty sure I'm between 5 and 6 weeks and don't have an ultrasound for another 2 weeks so I'm dying for symptoms. While I keep telling myself it's early and normal to not have symptoms, it's so nice to see so many other people had such minor symptoms."
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,hopefaithandlove,2,Wed Jul 1 13:15:15 2015 UTC,Me! I basically forgot I was pregnant until around 18 weeks.
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,digitabulist,2,Wed Jul 1 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"I had a good bit of soreness, but no sickness and no significant food aversions. My main symptom was and remains tiredness (like, I need to put down my head on my desk right now tiredness). I'm still honestly feeling pretty good compared to many of my friends in the same place (22 weeks tomorrow). It helped me a lot to see the posts that said ""right now, you are pregnant"" and it continues to be a mantra even though I can feel kicks now!"
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,thefatladysingeth,2,Wed Jul 1 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"I had two symptoms: severe fatigue and sore boobs. Also, some constipation, but that was a problem I had before pregnancy. I wasn't hormonal or emotional, nor did I have morning sickness. Consider yourself lucky. It worried me a bit too, but I was told by women who did deal with those symptoms that I should be grateful. I'm 20 weeks now and I'm very happy that I've had an easy pregnancy. I still worry though. I understand that propensity. I think most of us expecting do worry. It's the nature of becoming a mother.  I got the impression from medical/pregnancy literature that you should only worry if you've had symptoms in early pregnancy and they abruptly stop. If that's the case, then a call to the midwife is probably the right course of action."
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,rosekayleigh,2,Wed Jul 1 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"Same. I'm 8 weeks 5 days with super minimal symptoms. I have some constipation/gas, some tenderness on my boobs near my armpits (but only if I'm pressing on them), and no nausea. I think I feel more tired? I feel mostly normal. But I saw the heart beat last Wednesday so there is something going on in here!"
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,illogical_newt,2,Wed Jul 1 18:52:23 2015 UTC,We are just lucky. Please see a post I made last week: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/3ayrp8/did_you_have_no_morning_sickness_and_go_on_to/
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,Lula5000,3,Wed Jul 1 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"When I had my daughter (many moons ago!) I had no symptoms. Not a one. I've always had irregular periods - could go months at a time without one. The only ""symptom"" I had was I was gaining weight and no dieting or exercise was fixing it.   When I finally figured it out, I was 4.5 months pregnant.   Whoops."
CautiousBB,3bp6c4,babbetteateoatmeal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:14 2015 UTC,Had my 8 week ultrasound today. 1 happy wriggly baby measuring 8 weeks 5 days. Obviously lack of symptoms means nothing.
CautiousBB,3bowww,waywardmoon,4,Tue Jun 30 23:22:46 2015 UTC,"Ugh I am so sorry you are going through this.  I've been there and it sucks so much.  I feel like you don't need to lose all hope just yet.  Since you know you ovulated late, you are only measuring off by three days.  I feel there could be a conceivable (hah) explanation for that... like maybe you just implanted late? Sending good vibes your way."
CautiousBB,3bowww,La_plant,3,Wed Jul 1 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"I've had both of those done. For me, the blood work for recurrent loss was the most helpful. They found my clotting disorder and this time around, I'm being treated and appropriately monitored. So far so good. For the blood work, they took about 14 vials of blood and tested for a variety of issues. It wasn't a huge deal. For the histo, I think that's the HSG? They insert a catheter and run dye to check for any blockages and other noticeable uterine abnormalities. It was uncomfortable and made me a bit cramps, but IB profen fixed that right away! Best of luck to you!"
CautiousBB,3bowww,Bhotel21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"Just want to point out that acetaminophen is considered the safest pain killer to use while pregnant. It's best to avoid any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen or aspirin, though occasional use is not likely to cause any issues. As someone who had suffered a loss in the past, I did a lot of research into this before taking anything. What can I say, I'm a little paranoid now!    Edit: just realized you were not pregnant while taking the ibuprofen. But I'll leave the comment considering it is good advice :-P"
CautiousBB,3bowww,letsgosmokess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"LOL, definitely not pregnant while getting my HSG! Having suffered losses myself, I am all too aware of the paranoia. To point that I stopped using IB Profen all together when trying to conceive. Just would like to point out though for women with diagnosed clotting issues, baby aspirin is typically part of the regiment to help conceive and maintain a pregnancy."
CautiousBB,3bowww,Bhotel21,4,Wed Jul 1 22:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm sorry to see this...but it's super early still. As far as I was aware it's quite common not to see anything but a sac at that point...& measuring behind by a few days is also common. I say - it's not over til it's over!  It's good to prepare for the worst but hope for the best. You have my hope! Good luck!
CautiousBB,3bowww,k2p2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I keep going back and forth and thinking well maybe its fine, I mean the measurement might just be off.  Fingers crossed!"
CautiousBB,3bowww,mego3304,2,Wed Jul 1 13:51:36 2015 UTC,"I am in the same boat. According to my last period, I was 6w4d, but after doing bloodwork my numbers were supposed to double and then went down a little. I go today to find out what that means and to have another ultrasound. I am praying that everything is ok even though I know numbers going down isn't good. The positive side is I now know I am able to get pregnant, which is a plus since we have been trying for two years. Praying for you!"
CautiousBB,3bowww,mego3304,2,Wed Jul 1 12:50:18 2015 UTC,"Good luck on your ultrasound today, I hope its positive news! Keep me updated?   I am trying to keep the same silver lining outlook - atleast we know we can get pregnant! Now its just a matter of keeping it."
CautiousBB,3bowww,mego3304,2,Wed Jul 1 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for caring. This site has been a blessing because it being so early I hadn't told many people so it is hard to discuss with anyone and this site has really helped me talk things out this passed week. I did unfortunately tell my mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom, inlaws, brothers & sisters, and grandparents. It is going to be hard if I have to go back, but there was no way with a first pregnancy that I could keep it from them for that long. And they are my family so I know they are my support team, but it is nice to have other women in my corner."
CautiousBB,3bowww,mego3304,2,Wed Jul 1 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like I'm not pregnant anymore. My numbers went down instead of doubled. On Friday they were 40,000 and on Monday they were 28,000. The doctor said I had something called a chemical pregnancy or a blighted ovum. I am still being positive in knowing that I can get pregnant and it will happen when it is time I guess. But the next time will make me very cautious to tell people."
CautiousBB,3bowww,Arrowmatic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry :(  I wish you two the best of luck going forward, your HCGs are higher than Ive ever seen mine so thats amazing!  If you need someone to talk to in the future, since telling people is bad luck so early, feel free to message me hugs  My doctor called me back after my betas and is worried its ectopic so now I have to go to an urgent radiology appointment tomorrow to check if its ""ectopic or just a miscarriage"" so sounds like Im out either way as well"
CautiousBB,3bowww,BananaBoggle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Well try to stay strong... And I will be praying for you. And I really appreciate the chat since it hasn't been an easy 4-5 days!
CautiousBB,3bowww,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"I was measuring 2-3 days behind on my first scan at 5w3d (we just saw a sac measuring around 5 weeks), but was measuring 2 days ahead with a healthy bub by 10 weeks. Apparently that's pretty common since you're talking millimeters when it comes to measurements and it's easy to be off by a few days. I would try to stay calm and see how your other results look. I'm so sorry you have to go through this stressful time."
CautiousBB,3bowww,septicidal,2,Wed Jul 1 02:30:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Your story sounds similar to mine so I am crossing my fingers! I just get nervous with the bleeding on top of it, I think thats why my OB is so pessimistic about it all."
CautiousBB,3bowww,pinkfern,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're going through this.  Personal story of hope: I was measuring something like 5 days behind at my first ultrasound, and my doctor said it was absolutely nothing to worry about.  By the 10th week, the little thing was completely caught up and on track."
CautiousBB,3bowww,Grave_Girl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:53:00 2015 UTC,Yay! Thats good to hear :D
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,dutchqueen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"I seem to recall reading that sudden, massive swelling is cause for concern. If yours is gradual, particularly @ the end of the day, that seems likely normal. Have you asked your doctor or midwife if compression stockings/tights would be appropriate?"
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,brycedoula,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:21:27 2015 UTC,"It's mostly all day.  Evenings are a bit worse, but not much.  I'm not sure I'd classify it as sudden, that's why I'm not too worried.  My doctor don't seem concerned, at all, when I mention it.  But it's just getting difficult to move my joints nicely.  I mean, I only have 2 weeks to go, I might just tough it out."
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,brycedoula,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:51:33 2015 UTC,"My friend had considerable swelling with her first pregnancy, but it wasn't nearly as bad with pregnancies 2 & 3. Sorry to hear that it's so uncomfortable for you, but you're right - only 2(-ish) more weeks to go. That's so exciting!"
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,Indirya,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:02:56 2015 UTC,"Ditto that sudden swelling can be cause for concern but gradual is generally not. My feet ballooned in the last 8-10 weeks and they shocked everyone who saw them. By the end of the day it hurt to walk they were so swollen. I had a desk job and spent a lot of time sitting down. My midwife was never concerned as it was only my feet and it wasn't sudden onset.  My sister had pre-e so I was really paranoid about it. I never had proteins in urine or high BP until 38 weeks when my BP started rising but nothing to cause major concern and when I was induced at 39+6 my urine tested positive for proteins (like the pee stick went as green as it could possibly go). Because I was being induced anyway I wasn't diagnosed with pre e but seems like I must have just got it because the few days before there was no proteins in my urine.   As for reducing the swelling, keep those feet moving through the day and put them up at night, like vertical. My feet were better the days I stayed active. My midwife suggested sticking my feet in a bucket of cold water but I couldn't bring myself to do that! I'm now 3 weeks post partum and my feet have finally come back to normal and every time I look at them I can't believe how small and skinny my feet are!   Edit: words"
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,maybebabyg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"My legs swelled pretty bad in the last three weeks of pregnancy, doctors and everyone enjoyed telling me it was normal and not to stress even when it was so painful I couldn't walk or bend my legs.  When I went into false labour at 36+4 the swelling had gone up to my thighs and I had traces of protein in my first urine sample, but not my subsequent ones and my blood pressure was fine so the midwives told me it wasn't worth worrying about.  When I went in for my induction t 37+1 the swelling was up to my hips, belly and back (they needed a longer epidural needle to accommodate for the swelling). I had +1 protein in my urine consistently, my blood pressure was slightly high on and off and my bloodwork confirmed pre-e.  I never swelled on my face and my hands were within the normal pregnancy swelling range.  If laying down doesn't work, try some light walking, if that doesn't help talk to your doctor, especially if you start looking sausage-y."
CautiousBB,3bpdnw,moccasinspaws,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"I have a question similar to this one, because I'm worried about my feet/ankles swelling too, except I'm only at 20 weeks. I know that's unusually early for swelling. Should I be worried? I'm going to mention it at my appointment next week, but is it the type of thing I should call about? My hands are a tiny bit swollen (had major trouble getting my rings off and they wont go back on) but it's mainly my feet and ankles."
CautiousBB,3bob1s,HazMat68W,3,Tue Jun 30 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"Yay for supportive SOs!  I'm 10 weeks now, but I swear weeks 5 and 6 were the worst for my anxiety and worrying so I feel your pain!  I just wanted to chime in to let you know that I didn't get bad morning sickness until 7 weeks. And all my other symptoms up until then, the same you're having, came and went. So don't rely to heavily on those to make you feel better.   Sending good vibes your way!"
CautiousBB,3bob1s,Adsailor,2,Tue Jun 30 22:11:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!! Crossing fingers :)
CautiousBB,3bob1s,TheLibraryLady,3,Wed Jul 1 00:27:06 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. At 5-6 weeks, it's really early to be telling people, so you don't have a support network yet and there are no visible changes so it's hard to believe it's really happening and symptoms are off and on. That point is HARD.   I used to tell my husband all the things I had read here and he would grab my face and say ""today, we are pregnant"" which helped me calm.   Good luck!"

CautiousBB,3bmwkb,k2p2,5,Tue Jun 30 14:56:05 2015 UTC,Thanks! Just hoping it sticks knowing it's so early. I've had mild cramps the last few days which has been a little worrisome. I asked my doctor to order an hcg and progesterone lab due to pcos. Time will tell! But holy shit I can actually get pregnant even with non existent mucus and a cervix that always seems clamped tight!
CautiousBB,3bmwkb,k2p2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:25 2015 UTC,So exciting :D I'll look forward to reading updates when you've had your appointment & results :)

CautiousBB,3bmwkb,Cyndragosa,2,Tue Jun 30 18:48:46 2015 UTC,Eee that's the same one I took!! I actually tested the day my period was supposed to come BECAUSE of the cramps. They just felt different somehow!  Keep positive! Yay!
CautiousBB,3bmwkb,Baron_von_chknpants,2,Tue Jun 30 15:43:00 2015 UTC,Hahah! I took about 3 different manual ones before getting a digital! I haven't had cramps in aggggges. So it's been kind of weird having them! From what I've read it's common so I'm trying not to worry until I have an appt.

We are planning on getting a gender ultrasound at a place near us at 15 weeks because my OB's office waits until 22 weeks for the anatomy scan. Too long!"
CautiousBB,3bo8t2,Ironbornsuck,2,Tue Jun 30 21:06:36 2015 UTC,Go for it. Ultrasounds are safe and won't harm you or your baby in any way. It would actually be a good thing if it helped keep your stress level down.

CautiousBB,3bnlvf,mego3304,6,Tue Jun 30 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"I think there's a really good chance that it's just too early. We date a pregnancy from the day of your last period right? But if you have A slightly longer cycle, or if you ovulate a little later than the so called average (is anyone actually average, I suppose enough must be) then your dating won't be right. Like, a woman with a 28 day cycle who ovulates on cd14 will be further a long than someone with a 30 day cycle who ovulates around cd19. It's only a few days but at 6 weeks it's a big difference as that is when the heartbeat is just starting.   I know it's hard but try to have a little optimism or at the very least keep really busy."
CautiousBB,3bnlvf,Bibbityboo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"Well crap now I am really freaking out. I just got a call from the doctor's office and they want me to come in tomorrow. Like I said in my post, I had blood work done. The nurse said that she is going to discuss my numbers. I asked if there was a problem and she said it looks like the numbers went down a little.   I am completely freaking out. And how can I not think this is bad?"
CautiousBB,3bnlvf,JaneDarkmagic,3,Tue Jun 30 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on what number she is talking about.  If it's your hcg, yes it is bad for it to go down.  If it's your progesterone or estrogen they might just give you some supplements.  I hope it's the latter!"
CautiousBB,3bnlvf,ghoastie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm not sure what the numbers were. I assume HCG but I'm not sure because she was talking about them doubling."
CautiousBB,3bnlvf,La_plant,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"We had gestational sac at 5 weeks and a heartbeat at 6 wks, 1 day.  HOWEVER, we absolutely know date of conception and are pretty close to knowing date of implantation because my LO is an IVF baby.  Given all that, even though we had a heartbeat, we couldn't really see squat.  If your period isn't incredibly regular, your LO could be at 5 weeks, and you wouldn't know.  The waiting is the hard bit, good luck.  <3"

CautiousBB,3bnlvf,violetvgn,2,Wed Jul 1 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what happened to me with my last pregnancy.  This may upset you, but I feel you might want honest answers so I will give you my experience.  I went in around 6+4 for my first appointment and there was only a gestational sac.  At that point, they thought it might just be too early, maybe dates were off, etc., so I went back the next week to see if there was progress.  Unfortunately for me, there was still no fetal pole or yolk sac, only the gestational sac (which had grown slightly, but not significantly).  Ultimately, it was what they call a ""blighted ovum.""  However, during this ordeal I did a ton of research, reading zillions of forum posts by other women, and I really think it really could go either way.  There are plenty of positive outcomes that happen due to the ultrasound simply being too early.  I will hope for the best for you."

CautiousBB,3bmm18,haiyouguize,6,Tue Jun 30 13:09:57 2015 UTC,"What you want to remember with betas is as long as their doubling that's good.    While 19 is low, maybe you got the day of conception wrong etc.   I find with tests that depending on your urine, the dye strength they will continue to be dark or light.   Fingers crossed sending good vibes"
CautiousBB,3bmm18,whatgoesup56,3,Tue Jun 30 14:15:12 2015 UTC,"While 19 is low, it's not out of the range of normal. According to the chart at http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/hcg-levels.aspx it's within even the 5 week range. He could just be a slow grower.  Yes, it's possible that things could go wrong. But you're not bleeding, you're not in pain, your HCG was within range.. there's every possibility things could go right.

CautiousBB,3bmm18,Cyndragosa,2,Wed Jul 1 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the line darkening and lightening can mean nothing... Might just be the way that particular test is. I know that mine would vary, and my nurses told me its just the way the tests are.  I had a few done at the hospital, after experiencing weeks of bleeding and spotting. My nurse would kindly do the urine tests each time to make me feel better. Some days the big plus was right there bold as anything, and some days it was super faint.   Keep positive, hard as it is, because the stress won't help either way."

CautiousBB,3bmbe9,pinkfern,6,Tue Jun 30 11:09:18 2015 UTC,"Miscarriage should never be diagnosed based on one ultrasound alone. 6w5d is VERY early to visualize a heartbeat on ultrasound. If there was flickering seen it was likely the embryo's heartbeat but the positioning and ultrasound quality could have affected the ability to visualize it clearly.  Whatever happens, please try to remember that early issues are largely chromosomal and there is nothing anyone can do to affect the outcome.  If a tranvaginal ultrasound next week shows no change, talk with them about whether you can wait to see if you miscarry naturally rather than immediately going in for a D&C. Either way, see about having blood levels done to make sure the miscarriage is complete."

What are the benefits to letting things occur naturally? According to my obgyn they prefer to go the medically managed route here (Germany) and at the moment I'm pretty keen to move the process along."
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,ShinyArcanines,3,Tue Jun 30 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"With my MC, I had a D&C. I cried all day before my appointment and even more so when they had to put a tablet inside me to soften my cervix. I was put under and woke up to my partner and mom fussing over me. The risks of infection were very low (less than 1%) but I managed to score a mild one. Had pain, went on anti-biotics that made me feel like shit. I'd still choose a D&C over natural because it was so relieving to know I didn't have to worry about anything being left over, I could mentally heal. It's best to look on both sides as some people find doing it naturally very healing, giving them 'closure' but I don't think I could deal with that. So sorry for your loss x"
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,Grave_Girl,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:53:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for letting me know your experience! I didn't know that it was done under a general anesthetic. Were you in hospital long? Can I ask how far along you were?
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,TheLibraryLady,2,Tue Jun 30 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"I was out the same day. Had to stay overnight (about 16 hours) with the infection, but that was because I was admitted at 10pm-ish and had to wait to be discharged/my medicine to be ready. I was 7 weeks but baby stopped growing at 5. I don't want to go into the details of a D&C (refused to let the doctor tell me too after I read briefly about the procedure) but if it wasn't offered under general anaesthetic I don't think I would've gone through with it.   Best of luck whatever you choose :)"

CautiousBB,3bmbe9,motherofdragoons,2,Wed Jul 1 09:13:38 2015 UTC,"The benefit to allowing the miscarriage to happen naturally is that you don't have the risks associated with medical management.  They are very slight risks, but they are there."
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,motherofdragoons,2,Tue Jun 30 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for letting me know that's a possible route.
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,Grave_Girl,3,Tue Jun 30 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry things don't looks good.   I had a D&C with my first missed m/c. I have written about it on another post on this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/34ze45/introduction_and_bad_news/ - with a response to questions I was asked. I'd rather not type it all out again, so excuse the copy and paste but it might have some information you find useful in making a decision about medically managed or natural m/c.   ""I've tried to give as clear a description as I remember, as knowing what to expect might help you make a decision on what next. Hope it's not too much.  I had a missed miscarriage at nine and a half weeks in November. It was caught quickly (just days after the heartbeat had stopped) as I had been in for close monitoring and I remember feeling devastated. I was told I could wait for the m/c to pass naturally but I had been on progesterone and potentially it could have taken up to 3 months for it to complete and I was eager to try again as quickly as possible, so when the doctor recommended a D&C we went with it. I had a D&C within a week, which was my doctors advice. I was pretty lost so his guidance was really appreciated. The procedure itself was simple and quick and they did pick up on my irregular heartbeat which was helpful as I have been able to see specialists since. On they day of the D&C I had to have another ultrasound to confirm no change (the first u/s was Friday, the D&C was the following Monday). The doctor showed me the u/s and showed how there was no bloodflow and no heart beat, so we knew there was no hope. I was taken down to the pre-surgery area, the doctor popped a couple of tablets inside me to open my cervix, I waited a while for those to work (I asked for my iPad so I could read as my husband was instructed to wait outside and I needed a distraction) then I was given the anesthetic and taken in to the theater. When I came round from the D&C anesthetic I was very woozy. I had to ask to see my husband (I'm in SEAsia and this was a womens problem, so it didn't occur to anyone that I would like to have him waiting for me). They brought him in, then ushered him out again super quickly. My back was agony and I couldn't understand why, I thought it where my legs had been in stirrups. The nurse had to explain it was contractions and they would ease. That really shocked me as I hadn't realised that would happen. They did ease and it was fairly brief but I felt so angry at having to go through the motions for NOTHING and I felt sad and empty. I bleed for a little while afterwards, lighter than a period though and it eased fairly quickly. I was glad of my Ipad, (It gave me a distraction and they made me wait a couple of hours afterwards before sending me home). I was glad I had worn soft trousers with a loose elasticated waist so it was easy to redress. I wish I had taken headphones (the beeping of machines meant I couldn't sleep but they wanted me to sleep off the anesthetic for an hour or so before I could go home. I wish I had taken warm socks (the a/c on the ward was freezing) and I wish I'd taken baby wipes and sanitary towels (I was given one when I asked but it was horrible). In fact I wish I had prepared a pair of knickers with a sanitary towel all ready so I could have just slipped those on when I was redressing. It was a tough time and I really feel for you going through it. I was really eager but my husband was really anxious about trying again. We waited a cycle and spoke to the doctor, he recommended waiting another cycle to check on the fibroid which appeared at about 8 and a half weeks pregnant. MY husband was really shocked by the whole procedure, he hadn't seen anyone close to him go through this and didn't feel he had anyone to talk to. For a while he thought he would rather have been childless that watch me go through the pain again but he knew how much I wanted to try again and so during the wait he'd agreed we would. It was a brave move on his part as he was terrified. I had the physical side but the emotional side (less so the baby but more to do with loosing me) scared my husband and while friends who knew spoke to me, no-one really asked him how he'd managed. We we taken by surprise earlier than we'd planned e.g. before the second cycle was up (D&c's seem to be often followed by a fertility surge and the rhythm method is not an effective contraception for us) and we're really, really pleased (20 weeks today) but we did need to talk about all whether things would be OK and what to do if they weren't. It was tough times but we're stronger for it. I am sorry for your loss. I hadn't realised quite how common m/c is until I started using this forum. It doesn't make it less painful but it does mean you have people to call on and people who are more likely to understand your pain."""
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,motherofdragoons,2,Wed Jul 1 04:04:22 2015 UTC,"That was the most well-written and comprehensive answer I could've hoped for. My doctor told me yesterday that the process here is to go the medically managed route and I am keen to try again as soon as we can, so your information is infinitely relevant to my situation.   I've been hoping all day that I start to miscarry on my own - I realise what a horrible thought that is but I want to just start this process and put it behind us. I'm an optimistic person by nature and I can't help but feel that as terrible as this is, it's another step in the right direction (at least we were able to fall pregnant very quickly this time)  Definitely surprised about the contractions, but I'm glad everything else seemed to go fairly well for you. Also, thank you for the list of things you would've prepared (clothing-wise, distractions, etc) - I feel like these are things I will be able to plan/organise if it does come to this next week, and I will definitely feel more in control of the situation because of it.   Best of luck with your pregnancy, and again, thank you so much for sharing your experience. I hope I can be as consoling and helpful to somebody else in the future."
CautiousBB,3bmbe9,howverycleverofyou,2,Wed Jul 1 09:29:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a planner. Going into this blind was hard so I hope the suggestions are useful and makes the process less of a shock.  It was tough and it has made me very anxious about this pregnancy - which was something else which took me by surprise. I thought I would have a relaxed pregnancy, in reality I am a bundle of nerves. At each appointment (now 28 weeks, the original post was written a while ago) I have to scan before my doctor and I discuss anything. Until I have heard the heartbeat, I can't  focus.   I do feel like you, I was fortunate to fall pregnant (both times) quickly, which is obviously half the battle.   Something I forgot to add, I had terrible, terrible headaches for about a week afterwards. I am prone to migraines which can be made worse by the hormonal changes. I used Tylenol or paracetamol and was signed off for about two weeks. Most people don't need that, a friend who had the same procedure about a week later had it on the Thursday, was off Friday and back at work on Monday. I was still a sobbing mess and really couldn't have managed that. ,  I hope it goes as well as can be expected and when the timing is right (a cycle, a year, whatever works for you and your partner) you make it back here easily.

But I have read multiple times you can experience spotting early on because of the implanting process, which made feel a little bit better. I think it is just weird to see blood because we have always been taught that blood is bad. And we have been trying for 2 years and I just think every little thing is  bad, but I try to stay as positive as possible.

We have to push it to 7/13, which in my eyes is probably go because that will give the baby plenty of time to grow and we can hopefully see more and hear a heartbeat. (I'm hoping, but I don't really know what to expect.) I did have to do some blood work to see where my pregnancy level are. I did blood work Friday and then I had to go back to more blood work 48 hours later and I guess the numbers are supposed to double, but I don't know when I get to know those numbers."
CautiousBB,3bmqqz,rosekayleigh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"I had bleeding early last pregnancy which ended in MC. When it happened this pregnancy, I was inconsolable sobbing until I went to get checked with an US. Saw my little guys heartbeat flickering! My point is, sometimes it's just one of those inexplainable things. In her first trimester, my sister had a gush of blood that soaked through her trousers. She got rushed to A&E where even the doctors were convinced she'd lost the baby. They only performed the ultrasound because she insisted. My nephew is here now, a healthy little 14 month old! I know it's extremely difficult (damn near impossible) but try not to worry!"
CautiousBB,3bmqqz,ShinyArcanines,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"I had some light bleeding throughout my first trimester. The midwife never seemed that concerned. There was no blood in my uterus (in my dating scan), nor any cramping, so they chalked it up to a sensitive cervix. I noticed it would happen when I would try to go number 2. I was constipated and the straining would cause light spotting. My midwife told me that this wasn't an uncommon problem and I that I needed to drink more water. I'm 20 weeks now and it's been over a month since I've had any spotting. I hope it stays that way. Even when you know everything's okay, blood, however light it is, is a troubling sight. It doesn't always mean the worst though. Some women just bleed a little. My mom had the same problem with my siblings and me."

CautiousBB,3bmo1a,mariabutterfly,2,Tue Jun 30 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Here's hoping for the best.   Nothing was visible during my ectopic, either. They told me by the time my HCG was over 1500 they should be able to see something on the transvaginal, but all they could find related to my pregnancy was my corpus luteum. That combined with the fact that your levels should double every 3 days and mine were only doubling after about 7 days gave them my diagnosis.   I had spotting, also. I didn't know I was pregnant at first. I found out when I went in for my annual pap smear. At first the blood was pretty red and they said it was probably caused by irritating the cervix during the pap. Later when it was brown, they said it was probably old trapped blood. Apparently that's not incredibly abnormal even during normal pregnancies.  By the time I had the surgery, my tube had started to burst. I had no pain whatsoever. I've also had cysts before, but this didn't even feel like that. I just felt bloated, not in pain at all.  I really do hope you're just not as far along as you thought and everything turns out alright. But if ectopic has even been mentioned, I think you should mentally prepare yourself. It's not an easy thing to go through.  Best wishes."
CautiousBB,3bmo1a,artipants,2,Tue Jun 30 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely hoping for the best! Still-Please keep on them to monitor everything. My sister had no idea her first was ectopic until it burst. No pain, no fever, no bleeding. She thought she was having ovary pain for the same reason - a cyst. She wasn't trying to get pregnant though so she didn't seek medical attention because she was used to cysts. It destroyed her tube. She has a great baby girl now, but it was a tough time for a while.

Personally, when I had really sore nipples/breasts doing it from behind was out because they just ached so much I hormonal-cried. Not sexy.   FYI sometimes sex can make you spot bleed. It doesn't mean the baby is in danger, just that your cervix got a little bit irritated. It's very common but can be alarming if you're not aware of it (or even if you are aware)."
CautiousBB,3bm9wa,summersintheair,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:58:49 2015 UTC,"In the first trimester everything can continue as normal. You don't really have any restrictions based on a big belly - the only change in sex is you sometimes feel nauseous or some cramping/pain and need to accommodate that.   In the second/third, though, it gets a little interesting finding a comfortable position for all parties involved!"
CautiousBB,3bm9wa,melissarose8585,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:11:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely okay to have sex unless your doctor puts you on pelvic rest for some reason. Pregnancy has made my already high sex drive even higher. I can't keep my hands off my husband! All positions were good for us up until week 28ish. I'm 35 weeks tomorrow and still get on top, but it's definitely easier with him behind me. I've also asked him to massage my boobs and nipples countless times. It gets me even more ready to go while also releasing some of the pressure."

My pregnancy was hell on earth, but even through the difficult moments my baby is the best. I promise it's worth it, and this is coming from someone who seriously considered what life had been like if I had an abortion because I was THAT sick.

I don't hold a lot of hope for an easy baby. But at least everything looks healthy/normal so far.  Have you been able to talk to your OB about anti-nausea medication? My OB told me to start with Unisom and B6, but when they stopped helping prescribed Reglan. It's made a big change in my quality of life thus far... Unlike every woman I've talked to, my nausea/vomiting got significantly worse at 16 weeks and hasn't let up yet (nearing 19 weeks)."

Is there a good reason to increase vagal tone, or is it just an unwanted side effect of the hormonal changes?"
CautiousBB,3bklne,doc_mc_schufins,2,Tue Jun 30 02:28:53 2015 UTC,I think it's just an unwanted side effect. it's also to blame for the dizziness a lot of women get (especially with position changes) when preggers.

CautiousBB,3bjkdv,digitabulist,2,Mon Jun 29 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"If they do a cerclage, progesterone and bed rest it'll be either once you're lower than 2.5cm or 2cm depending on your doctor.  Mine was about 2.4cm at 20 weeks, I reduced my activity, drove to the grocery store rather than walk, walked to the bus stop at the end of my street and took a bus one stop to the train station rather than walk the 10 minutes to the station, that sort of thing. By my 30 week scan it was back up to 3cm and was over 4cm at my 34 week scan, the doctors were joking I'd never go into labour."
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,maybebabyg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks. That makes me wonder if it could be my fault for overextending thus far?"
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,maybebabyg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"Unlikely, my doctor says it's probably a coincidence that reducing my activity worked. He said there's not a lot of evidence that bed rest works, he feels it's more for safety in the event something goes wrong."
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,IVIacNasty,2,Wed Jul 1 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"It was a Friday and my wife was 21w2d when we went in for her scheduled cervical check (twin boys). Her cervix measured at 1.5 cm and she was put on strict bed rest for the weekend then told to come back in Monday for another check. Monday morning her cervix was down to 1 cm in length. She had a rescue cerclage that day at 6 pm.  Before the cerclage our doctor told us that with twins the statistics are pretty inconclusive, and that there was a risk of her water breaking during surgery as well a risk of going into labour for the next 48 hours. However without the cerclage our doctor felt we would go into labour in the next week or two.  She was put under for the surgery (due to an unrelated blood clot a week before) and everything went perfectly. That night was a little rough, she had what felt like severe cramping all night and a lot of discomfort with the catheter, but after a couple days she was completely fine. I just asked her as I'm writing this and she said that was well worth it, a tiny price to pay.  A week after the surgery we had another cervical check and her length was up to 1.9 cm! As of today we are 25 weeks and are still going strong :)  My wife has been on strict bedrest in the hospital ever since but we are making the best of it. She has taken up cross stitching and we've been abusing our Netflix account.  It hasn't been an easy ride, and everyone's experience is unique, but we feel like the cerclage has saved our pregnancy so far. We have another cervical check this Friday which will really tell us where we stand, but we're a week past fetal viability and I feel like we have both the cerclage and my wife's determination to thank :)"
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,smileywran,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:40:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. Your positive outlook and perspective is inspiring! I don't know if I'd be saying the same thing - I'm really not looking forward to the possibility of surgery and bedrest.
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,tehjill,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:03:55 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the cervix is usually about 4cm for FTMs, until late in the 3rd tri when it begins to shorten in preparation for labour. For me, my cervix was down to 1.5cm at 37 weeks, which was considered great as it showed my body was preparing for labour. I'm not sure about bed rest, it would depend if it continues to shorten or if it stays at that length."
CautiousBB,3bjkdv,Wolf_Lady,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"(on mobile, sorry for any errors) Typically, they want to see anything greater than 3cm in length, with 4 being ideal, IIRC.   As for the cerclage and bed rest, it depends. I had an emergency cerclage at 20 weeks because I was fully effaced and had nearly no cervix. I was put on strict bed rest, even though I had a previous successful pregnancy and no indication of having an incompetent cervix. This meant only getting out of bed to use the restroom and shower, and no sitting up.   A friend of mine, however, had a cerclage put in at 16 weeks as a precaution due to some complications and has just been told to limit her activity (no long bouts of standing, no heavy lifting), but can otherwise go to work and live pretty normally.   I hope that answers some of your questions, but I think the level of activity will depend on your doctor and how little cervix you have. Like I mentioned, I was funneling and my water bag was exposed, so I was really in a bad spot and strict bed rest was my only option, although I've read that there's no empirical evidence that supports that laying down prevents premature delivery.   ETA: I forgot to mention about the surgery. First,  I had to get an amnio to make sure there was no indication of an infection. For the cerclage, it takes place in the OR, so it's serious business.  The anesthesiologist gave me a spinal, and I was awake for the entire 30 minute procedure. Recovery wasn't bad at all, but i did have a 5 day stay at the hospital, but I'm pretty sure that was due to how far gone my cervix was.   If you need more info, look up incompetent cervix boards. Lots of women on those boards end up getting a cerclage, so you might get more varied responses."

I wanted him to be healthy and perfect (spoiler, he is :p).   We went for extra scans and they took really good care of us.

CautiousBB,3bjee6,hasavagina,6,Mon Jun 29 18:36:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like fundal height is kind of bs, based on my experience. When I was not quite 32 weeks, they measured me at 34 weeks and said the baby was probably big. I freaked out about it, worrying that I would have a huge baby that I couldn't deliver naturally.   When they did an ultrasound 2 weeks later, baby measured exactly average, and she was born at 7 pounds 7 ounces at 38 weeks 5 days, so slightly big, but not huge at all. My worry was for nothing!  Is your doctor concerned?"
CautiousBB,3bjee6,Sellae,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:42:08 2015 UTC,She's getting an ultrasound but she was really calm but i feel like she may be worried or I'm projecting.   She did at the baby could be hiding a little better than most.   Also I am small in stature (5'1.5 and 108lbs before pregnancy) and i was a small baby so maybe that could just be it. I hope
CautiousBB,3bjee6,natural_seattleite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:07:25 2015 UTC,There are always outliers.  There are some women who never even know they're pregnant.  I don't think this is something to worry about - it's one wee metric with very limited predictive ability.
CautiousBB,3bjee6,jessercas,3,Wed Jul 1 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"I've been measuring small according to fundal height for awhile now.  I had an ultrasound 2 weeks ago showing that I have a perfectly average sized baby. At 36 weeks I'm still told how tiny I look, actually on Friday my doctor measured my height and said, ""well you have a normal sized baby in there, you're just hiding it well.""  I guess sometimes it just varies on your body type."
CautiousBB,3bjee6,Grave_Girl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:22 2015 UTC,I hope. Although I have no idea where my baby could be. I'm short (5'1.5) and at 25 weeks I'm 125lbs (started at 108lbs) so there's not much space to hide.
CautiousBB,3bjee6,MarshmallowGuru,2,Tue Jun 30 00:11:22 2015 UTC,"Fundal height is not a terribly great indicator on its own.  The way the baby is lying can affect it, your hydration can effect it somewhat, and user error can affect it quite a bit.  (Yes, even very skilled providers sometimes make mistakes.)    An ultrasound is the proper followup here.  Have you already had the 20 week anatomy scan?  Was everything normal then?  Some babies are just smaller than normal; I'd like to think anything major would have been found at the anatomy scan, but at the very least it will give you a baseline to measure growth.  Sometimes babies are smaller, especially when Mom is smaller, and so the ultrasound followup will hopefully be reassuring.  Worst case scenario, probably, is that you will need closer monitoring."
CautiousBB,3bjee6,Melisara,2,Tue Jun 30 01:42:11 2015 UTC,Yeah. I had my anatomy scam at 18 weeks and ended up measuring 5 days behind then but still well within normal measurements and everything came up perfect aside from a lower laying placenta. I get lots of kicks and nothing seems off on me elsewise. My blood pressures perfect and baby's heart rate is perfect. It just his you hard when something isn't perfect and you fear the worst.   Thankfully after a day of reading I'm feeling more confident. And a scan will put me at ease. Plus I get to see baby again so that's a bonus.
CautiousBB,3bj2ag,hopefaithandlove,6,Mon Jun 29 17:09:27 2015 UTC,"I'm 17w3d pregnant with an IVF baby. I'm fortunate in that I've never experienced a miscarriage, but I know well the struggle to get pregnant and the fear and anxiety involved with seeking treatment.  I have found the fear has never gone away. But, it does change. For me, infertility feels like PTSD, and I can't just relax and enjoy my pregnancy the way someone else might be able to -- I'm far too aware of what COULD go wrong, and I'm far to aware that we're not a lucky couple. But, as we hit different stages, the fear changes, and in some ways is a little more manageable.  I still feel a lot like the shoe is going to drop and something will be wrong. I had a huge bleed early on and ended up bleeding for a month solid due to a SCH and was on bedrest. I was convinced that was it. But it passed. Graduating from the fertility clinic eased some of my fears, but it never went away, just changed to what else could go wrong.  Gettnig our chromosome testing back and hearing that we are absolutely low risk (1 in 10,000) for the major issues was very reassuring, and again, my fear for that has gone, but it has not left. I am still worried about what will go wrong next, with my latest fear being about the anatomy scan on the 17th.  But, I will say I found the first trimester the hardest. Maybe it was because we had the big bleed? But really I think a lot of it has to do with how unknown it is. The baby is too small to feel movement, and usually the only way we know its in there is to hear the heartbeat or see an ultrasound.   I will say this: People like us need to make sure we push through some of our anxiety. You don't wnat to look back on your pregnancy and say ""I wish I could just have enjoyed it."" That doesn't mean you get mad about your fears, or that you feel bad about them, but htat you manage them. In the first little while, its ok, its hard until you've had your ultrasound, but as time goes on, make sure to check in with yourself and make sure you're not letting fear guide you too much.  And find ways to manage your fears. For me, it helped to buy a home doppler. I had some spotting the last two days, but being able to hear that heartbeat? I'm not nearly as worried as I would be otherwise."

Everyone says that the first trimester is the ""dangerous"" trimester, and for some (read: a lot) of people, I'm sure that's true.  But I won't stop being scared until they're headed off to university. Ok, I might be exaggerating a bit. Just like /u/Bibbityboo, I got a home doppler, and it helps a lot. I still get the spotting, I still go to L&D (I swear they are getting sick of me there), but at least the doppler means I don't have to be freaking out on the drive there."

Their policy is that both mother and baby get checked at every appointment.  I've been having bad skin reactions to the ultrasound gel they use for the Doppler and ultrasounds and was told at my last appointment if they couldn't find the heartbeat via Doppler with the alternative gel, they would send me over for a transvaginal scan. Thankfully the alternative gel they found doesn't give me a rash, and worked well for both the Doppler and at my anatomy scan.  If you're really concerned, call and ask them about their policy, and just stress that you are anxious about the pregnancy and would like the reassurance of knowing the heartbeat is fine."

The only conditions would be to not push to  increase weight on freeweights the same way you would if not pregnant. Also, as pregnancy progresses, ensure you aren't doing as many lifts that will engage your abs.   Source: my personal trainer and OB! Weight training has been the one thing I had the energy for. My cardio went down the drain."

I may have thrown up about 3 times overall at the very very beginning of my pregnancy, around the 6-7 week mark. After that, nothing. Sore nipples on occasion but I didn't buy a maternity bra til waaaay too late so that was quite possibly my own silly fault.   Not all pregnancies have symptoms :) hopefully you'll see that reassuring little bean on that screen on Tuesday & it will help you be calm.  I think worrying is just part of being a Mum...I think everyone got that symptom! Good luck :)"
CautiousBB,3bh14z,k2p2,4,Mon Jun 29 04:05:40 2015 UTC,Hang in there. I know it's hard. I've been in the same asymptomatic and anxious boat since I got my positive. I'm 7w4d now and we just saw our Sprout and heard their heartbeat last week. Still feeling very little in the way of nausea etc. Just think positive and stay occupied. All the best!
CautiousBB,3bh14z,howverycleverofyou,4,Mon Jun 29 04:19:17 2015 UTC,"Symptoms always come and go, I find. I remember with my last pregnancy I got terrified when my nipples stopped hurting. Then it came back with a vengeance and I was like ""whyyyyy didn't I enjoy it while it lasted?"". This time around I thought ""I'm way more experienced now, I know to relax"". Ha! After being diagnosed with hyperemesis I had a couple of days where I had no nausea and could actually eat. Did I? Hell no, I was too worried about something being wrong that I completely lost my appetite. As soon as the nausea came back I thought ""whyyyyy didn't I enjoy it while it lasted?"".   You're always going to worry, people will always tell you that everything is most likely fine. The joys of pregnancy! But do keep trying to tell yourself ""statistically, everything is fine. Worrying won't change anything. Enjoy feeling good!"".  Good luck xx"

DH, whom I love dearly (or at least keep telling myself that), has decided that now is the perfect time for him to fulfill his dream of opening his own business. A business that will be located 2.5 hours away from our current home, and will be officially opening one month before I'm due. Over the next 3 months, he will be living 2.5 hours away, going to multiple week-long trainings at various places all over the country, and spending every last penny of our savings to get this business up and running. I love him to death, I am so proud of him for doing this, but holy shit I want to kill him. Worst. Timing. Ever. I can't move yet because I'm under contract at my job for three more months, so we will be living apart for pretty much the rest of the pregnancy (I'll be joining him a few weeks before my due date if all goes as planned). He is officially moving up there as of today and I'm trying to pretend like I'm cool with it but I'm a hot hormonal mess. I know he's only a few hours away if I really need him or if any emergencies come up, but he's not going to be able to come to most of my doctor's appointments and clearly isn't going to be around day to day. This is our first kid and I am totally heartbroken about it. I know it could be worst, and I'm trying to stay positive about everything, but today sucks."

Unfortunately, my round ligament pain decided to show up pretty soon after, and it hurt so much to move or bend over that I knew I couldn't keep trying clothes on.  So I went home and curled up on the couch until it faded. Guess I just won't look very patriotic this Saturday. Oh, and the local goodwill mixes in their maternity clothes with the plus size section, and after five minutes of looking I couldn't find a single maternity item. So I gave up.   And I noticed today that I'm getting some new stretch marks on my inner thighs. I still haven't even gotten back to my pre-pregnancy weight so I don't know where they came from.

I'm also trying to look at the progress of my lines (even though I know that won't really tell you anything) and they are not really helping. Two tests (dollar store ones) taken with the same urine have two very different lines. Ugh. I've had light cramping but no spotting. I can't go back in for a repeat draw like I'm supposed to because I'm on vacation in another state. :( I'm trying to hold out hope but that low first number has me worried.

Every night for the past week I wake up with pretty bad pain in my left hip and knee. It's enough to often disturb my sleep and leave me limping for the first hour or so of the day. I've tried sleeping differently and with pillows in various spots, but nothing makes it stop completely. Ugh. Any advice? Yesterday we went to run some baby errands, but nothing was really working out. The car seat that I wanted because it was ranked super well on safety doesn't fit in our small sedan without the passenger's knees literally touching the dashboard-- we tried the floor model at Babies R Us, which was super convenient. Most other car seats aren't much smaller. So we had to go on a wild internet search to find a smaller seat, which of course isn't rated as well on safety. But our only other choice would be to buy a new car, and that really wasn't in the cards for the next couple years. Also, I thought we were going to buy an Uppababy Vista stroller, but I don't even know if it fits through our front door! It's like half an inch too wide.  Does anyone else find it a little annoying when someone wants to know your EXACT due date? I'm trying not to focus too much on the exact date, since my little guy will likely make an appearance before or after that date. And, since my due date is in the middle of the month, I just like to think that he'll arrive in October, since those odds are pretty good. I've started to just say ""mid-October"" to keep people from asking more details. I just hate when people try to calculate back to when we had sex, etc, etc....    Okay. I feel better. THANK YOU!"

Our new choice is the Combi Coccoro, which is smaller, so it won't last us as long because of the compact size. But it's apparently one of the smallest seats of its kind.

The first trip to the dentist, the hygienist didn't take my pain seriously.  I went back the next day demanding to see the dentist, and they thought the pain might be from the crown being too high so they drilled it down.  That offered absolutely no relief.  I've been taking way too much Tylenol (how i really wish I could take 800mg of ibuprofen!) and worry about my poor liver.  I wake up 2 times every night in excruciating pain.  Let's get this over with!"
CautiousBB,3bhy28,simplysarah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:22:36 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry! Tooth pain sucks! I had a new crown placed when I was 6 weeks and I had to take tylenol for a week (including every middle of the night when it would wake me up) and was planning to get a root canal. Fortunately the pain subsided for me after a week. I hope you can get this over with soon! :(

CautiousBB,3bhrha,Idontknowhowtopregnt,2,Mon Jun 29 09:25:03 2015 UTC,Depends on what you like to do but if I need to stay put for some amount of time I always have some kind of knitting/crocheting to do. And at the same time you can make something nice for baby! I've been crocheting bibs recently which take not that long time (so it won't get as boring) and is something I can actually use later. There are many videos on youtube that teach you how to :)
CautiousBB,3bhrha,Oneofthese3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:12:46 2015 UTC,Sorry I should have been more specific.  I do crochet yes so I would need something to watch while I did that to keep me occupied.  I'm currently working on a corner to corner blanket for the baby.
CautiousBB,3bhrha,MyNameIsFU,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:24:54 2015 UTC,Netflix and a tablet or laptop. Play games and watch/listen to the TV.  Crochet is also very fun and easy to learn.  There are tons of videos on YouTube.

CautiousBB,3bh43h,maddiecoleman,5,Mon Jun 29 04:17:46 2015 UTC,"I suffered with Anorexia since I was 16. With my daughter, I gained the lower end of the spectrum (about 20-25 lbs) but she was very healthy because I had to force myself to eat. My only suggestion is to think of baby first. Eat, eat, eat. It could just be the types of food you're eating that isn't causing you to gain weight. Go see a GP who can refer you to a nutritionist/dietitian."
CautiousBB,3bh43h,autumnx,3,Mon Jun 29 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"Hey,  First congratulations on your pregnancy!  Its pretty scary for the first bit (ok its maybe scary for lots of it, but once you feel things, at least you've got a little indication that things are ok). So, know that your worries are normal, and that worries can't make something go wrong. If somehting goes wrong its due to chromosomes or something out of your control. Do not beat yourself up about anything. Right now, you're going to do your best, but that's all you can do.  You didn't mention if you do have an eating disorder or if your'e just naturally very skinny. I can't tailor my advice to your situation so I'm going to have to be a bit vague. But you'll sort it out!  First off, be realistic. If you're only 75 lbs, and you tell yourself you have to gain that 40 lbs you're going to be beating yourself up even if you ARE gaining (i.e. ""I'm up 10 lbs, but that's no where near where I need to be! What am I going to do???""). So, take what the doctor said as ""You need to increase your weight"" and set yourself some goals. Maybe it will be number oriented -- see if you can gain 2-3 lbs this week! OR if that is triggering for an eating disorder, or stressing you out, instead focus on what foods you are eating. Instead of thinking calories think ""I'm going to have some cucumber slices for the baby. This will give me some much needed vitamins."" or maybe ""I'm going to have a glass of milk, calcium will help my growing baby."" So instead of thinking about yourself and your body, you're thinking of this third party -- your child, and eating healthy for it.  Don't stress too much about morning sickness, it really is different for everyone. For me, I'm 17w3d and I've never had any. I'm one of the lucky ones who has been fine. Others will get it fairly mildly and a small handful will have it pretty bad! Often times, it sounds like its a matter of finding the foods that work right. (Maybe its having a banana as soon as you get up, maybe its chomping at toast or crackers). It'll be a bit differnet for everyone.  Get yourself on some good prenatals, this will help supplement anything you may be missing in your diet, and ensure you're getting your folic acid which is really important at this stage of the game. I take extra Vitamin D as well, so if you're ok with pills you can always do some research or see if there's anything extra that you need.  Overall your body will prioritize for the baby. Your baby gets first dibs on everything. So if you're fairly healthy, you should be fine. And if you're struggling, just know that you will suffer before your baby will (I find that comforting I don't know why).  Hang in there and good luck, this is really one day at a time. Deep breaths. You've got this."
CautiousBB,3bh43h,Bibbityboo,2,Mon Jun 29 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all baby is healthy, so that's great news!  Secondly, given how hard this has been for you, I really think you should tell your mother as soon as possible and get her on side so you have her there for support.  I also think you need to not worry so much about the eating thing. Skinny women have babies all the time! I am skinny too, and have always been skinny, and even lost a bunch of weight due to morning sickness, and baby is fine. Baby is designed to take what it needs from you, and as long as you are keeping something down and taking your prenatals, I don't think you need to be too concerned. If you are really worried about your weight, perhaps keep a food/calorie log and ask to get some tests done to check that your thyroid and other bodily functions are running smoothly.  Do you have a partner or friend or relative who can be there with you at your appointment to back you up and be your advocate in this? I think that will make a huge difference in dealing with doctors and their intrusive questions. Hugs, and good luck. Remember, baby is healthy and that is wonderful!"
CautiousBB,3bh43h,Arrowmatic,2,Mon Jun 29 05:34:58 2015 UTC,"I've had a really hard time and haven't been able to keep any food or fluids down; even bland foods to try and ease my vomiting but turn pale and nauseous when my stomach is empty. I'm also feeling extremely dehydrated. I try to snack occasionally but worried that I won't gain enough. The OB decided  40 lbs to bring me up to 115 would be reasonable.  Dating scan will be at 6 weeks (currently 4w) but I'm scared something bad is going to happen before then  I planned this first appointment secretly by myself. I'm really worried I'll be upset by her reaction, even though she is supportive, so I've been going alone. I don't know how to tell her or what to say but she is still wondering :( :(  Thanks for your advice and please keep me in your thoughts"
CautiousBB,3bh43h,TheLibraryLady,5,Mon Jun 29 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"40lbs is a difficult target. I am sure it is reasonable but if you do have an eating disorder, that might sound overwhelming.  For losing weight (something I am a little more familiar with) you're told to set lots of small targets to keep you feeling like you're making progress. Maybe for gaining weight, you can break it down into smaller, more achievable amounts?  I am glad the baby looks healthy, remember you're doing the best you can, making your appointments and trying to follow advice. It might be good to tell your mum sooner rather than later so you can get the support you need."
CautiousBB,3bh43h,TryingMaybeNow,2,Mon Jun 29 07:22:23 2015 UTC,I just want to second that skinny women have babies all the time.  My mom is 5'3 and always weighed just under 100 pounds.  She barely gained weight that wasn't actually just the baby.  And she had 4 kids this way. All of us are healthy much to the doctors of the days' disbelief.
CautiousBB,3bh43h,touchyfeely,2,Mon Jun 29 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! hugs   Also, it looks like from your other post that you found out you were pregnant two weeks ago when you were three weeks late? So you should be much further along than 3w4d pregnant today, since the pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the last actual period you had."
CautiousBB,3bh43h,Arrowmatic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"For telling your Mom, I would just turn to her during a quiet moment and say something like: ""Mom, I have something I need to tell you. I recently found out that I'm pregnant. I'm happy, but I'm feeling really scared right now."" and go from there. Tell her about the nausea and ask her advice, she has been through it herself so I am sure she will understand. Even if she is shocked, she loves you and if you ask for her help and support I am sure she will give it. Good luck!"
CautiousBB,3bh43h,motherofdragoons,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"If you are suffering from morning sickness get on meds sooner rather than later, it will make the difference in your early pregnancy in whether or not you are able to eat and keep food down.  I used over the counter Unisom but Diclegis is one that is prescribed a lot."

CautiousBB,3be5a8,allthecaramel,5,Sun Jun 28 11:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'm new here! I'm slowly weaning myself off of TFAB and splittling time here, r/plussizepregnancy and r/babybumps. I am 34, this is my very first time being pregnant and I truly never expected to get pregnant, if I'm honest! I have PCOS and Type 2 diabetes and hypothyroid, which can all combine to be a total shitstorm when it comes to fertility.  I started preparing for conception in January by working really hard to get my blood sugar in good condition (it was 5.5 at conception, yay!) and have lost about 30 pounds since then, too. Never in a million years did I think I would get a BFP 43 days after I had my IUD removed in May.   Because of the T2D, I will have a LOT more appointments and tests than most pregnant mamas do. I'm 5 weeks on Wednesday, at which point I suppose I might stop the compulsive morning pee-in-a-cup habit I've developed and start trusting my body a little more. We have our first appointment with my OB (who is a high risk OB and will be my primary for the pregnancy) at 7 weeks. I am already sending weekly blood sugars to my diabetic nurse specialist, who will put me on insulin when it's time and follow the blood sugars for my whole pregnancy. The pregnant body becomes more and more insulin resistant as time goes on, so some diabetic mamas end up on a LOT of insulin by the end of the pregnancy. Insulin doesn't pass the placenta, but blood glucose does. There are significant risks for a large baby or birth defects if your blood sugar isn't tightly controlled (A1C ideally below 6, 2 hour after meal checks below 120, etc). My blood sugar is in great shape so far, but there will be lots and twists and turns in this adventure, I am sure. Adding to the list of medical professionals helping me have a healthy baby is my endo, who will watch over my diabetes care and watch over my thyroid. The thyroid right now is right where we want it to be to avoid miscarriage risk.  EDD March 2, 2016 but diabetic babies are rarely allowed to go full term. Time will tell! Thanks, all, for being here for this cautious mama!"
CautiousBB,3be5a8,haiyouguize,3,Sun Jun 28 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"Copied from my intro post. 4 weeks today, EDD according to Fertility Friend is March 6th. Praying I make it there :)   Hello! I am excited to be here! I started getting faint positives at 10 dpo and finally got a positive digital at 12 dpo, yesterday.   I went in for a confirmation with the OB, their urine test was negative (as I thought it would be, as I was only 12 dpo and had just used the restroom an hour prior). They did a blood draw and I should get the results soon! I took a digital three hours later and it was positive, as was another one this morning, and my lines are progressing (which I know could mean nothing). So right now I am cautiously optimistic. The doctor wanted repeat betas next week but I will be on vacation. So I plan on taking more tests over the next week just to keep any eye on things, and I will go back in on the 6th for another draw. She said we will keep doing betas until my levels get high enough to see something on an ultrasound (if that happens). I'm glad to hear that! I'm glad they're not just going to see if it's positive and then tell me to hang out for three weeks.   I am also cautious because my first pregnancy four years ago ended in a chemical pregnancy shortly after four weeks. Oddly enough, I went to the ER with bleeding from the CP four years ago to the day that I got my positive digital this time around (yesterday). It's a strange coincidence! I'm hoping this little guy or girl decides to stick around!   Sorry for the novel, but I am glad to be here and I really hope I get to stick around!"

They don't hurt as such, just feel odd. They come & go & can feel like sudden sharp poking pain or just a sort of muscular pulling sensation. I'm assuming it's just stretching as Aoife seems to be growing & wiggling like mad.

I didn't find out for 2.5 more weeks. We had had an ultrasound at 6+4 and everything looked good. At 8+2, we went for an elective one, because my symptoms had been minimal and I was really nervous. We saw the little one and it did have a heartbeat. I remember wondering if it should be moving more, and wishing we could measure the HB. Since it was a boutique ultrasound place, not a medical one, they didn't give us the option. As we left, my husband was like ""so, are you going to calm down now?"" and I sheepishly said ""...yes...."" because we were past 8 weeks and that's supposed to be such a huge milestone. At my appointment 2.5 weeks later, the doctor said the baby was measuring 8w1d. I was so confused because we had seen it alive after that. He was like ""yeah. it probably passed that night."" He could have been wrong. Now that I type this out, it feels like a pretty bold statement for him to make. Maybe it had stopped growing at the rate it should have, but held on a little longer. Who knows. All I know is, despite my preparations, this day is very hard.  I had been having really brutal MS between 5-7 weeks and last week it started to be a little less consistent. Under the circumstances, I can't say I'm thrilled. Trying to be calm about it, but I'm wondering if they'll let me in to listen to heart tones next week. I am lucky to work for the healthcare group where my OB is. At 9+5 he's sneaking me in for an US, just to calm me down. And then my official first OB apptmt is 7/17 at 11 weeks exactly. I don't know if I can hold out that long with my symptoms fluctuating again!  Sorry for the wall of text. I hope everyone is having a better weekend than me."

I'll tell you what someone told me this time, I'd had an early loss so when I got pregnant this time I was a nervous wreck. ""today you are pregnant, try to enjoy it"". For me, that helped. We can't control what is happening at this point and sometimes we just have to try to let go of the obsession (easier said than done I know)."

My appetite is not back and I'm not enjoying eating. Decided to weight myself and I'm down 4lbs since I got pregnant :( Thankfully I have the day off so I can just live in the sofa and watch tv.   I have a NT scan booked at 11w+6 on 14th of july and first midwife appointment on july 21st! Can't wait!!

I've been feeling better but I didn't sleep well last night and feel like 5 miles of bad road today, physically and emotionally. I'm thinking of canceling all of my things I have to do today and hiding with a book.  I think my good blood pressure readings of last week were a fluke, we're back down into the mid-80's over low 50's again, the dizzy spells are not as bad though so maybe my body is adjusting to the new low.  Heading out of town by myself for a 9 hour (each way) drive to my hometown over 4th of July weekend, a little nervous about that. I usually love my alone time but the past couple weeks I want to be right next to hubby at all times.  Maybe this trip will be good for me. Stopping at a friend's in Nashville to pickup some hand me down baby stuff including a car seat and a breast pump.   Been feeling Gracie move a bit more definitively in the past week, went to a birthday party at a sports bar on Friday and the loud music had her tap, tap, taping away on my insides.

CautiousBB,3bc87j,namethatworks,2,Sun Jun 28 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"I am so so so sorry you had to experience this! I had kidney stones at weeks 24 and 39.5 in my first pregnancy. It turns out that if you have a predisposition to kidney stones before you get pregnant (most women aren't told whether or not they do), you have a high chance of having an attack while pregnant. Many of your organs slow down a lot to put the emphasis on growing the tiny human, and sometime this causes problems.   My stones were also mostly calcium. It basically means that we have a faulty filter. Drinking water is great, obviously. But there are a few other things you should do: avoid calcium supplements of all kinds first and foremost. Get your calcium from dairy and other fortified foods. Limit your leafy greens like kale and spinach, but if you do eat them, follow them up with a glass of milk or a slice of cheese to help with the calcium absorption. Add vitamin B6 to your regiment, and try to get one that is food based.   Did they do an ultrasound on you to tell you if there are other stones in your kidneys? If they did, and you do have stones, or if they didn't, I highly recommend finding a urologist in your area with experience with pregnancy and kidney stones. S/he will be able to keep track of you for the rest of your pregnancy. OBs rarely know how to manage kidney stones.  Disclosure: I've been helping my urologist get started with his study on pregnancy and kidney stones. My OB made it seem like my first round of stones were NBD. He was wrong.   Happy to discuss more if you have any questions!   And yes, stone contractions are way worse than labor contractions :)"

My first trimester though I started getting morning sickness christmas eve and all my favourite Christmas foods tasted awful, I am so hoping I can love them again this Christmas!

CautiousBB,3b7joh,thesnugglypuppies,3,Fri Jun 26 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"To add to this, my RE had a guideline for where the HCG should be before they can see anything on ultrasound.  Again, just a guideline, but it can help them figure out when they should see a heartbeat etc."
CautiousBB,3b7joh,female_engineer_here,3,Fri Jun 26 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"Though those numbers are low & slow, I plugged it into a doubling-time calculator (just google ""hcg doubling calculator"" and you will find a bajillion of them) and your doubling time is about 69 hours. Normal is considered 48-72 hours in early pregnancy, but I think we can all get freaked out by so many people who have numbers that triple in a day, and they're up at 10,000 by 4w 3d or whatever absurdity. My doubling time between my first two draws was 60 hours and my initial level was something like 45 (this was 13DPO, I got a positive test at 11DPO). I am 30 weeks and things are fine with my pregnancy.  But as for your question, getting repeat beta draws is totally standard. Not only does one draw tell you no information whatsoever, sometimes the only way they can get an idea of what is going on is by tracking levels over time. With wonky numbers or nothing found on ultrasound, some people get betas done 6, 8, or even 10 times. All depends on how they're changing."

This morning I did not want to get out of bed, so when we got to the office (husband has a 7am meeting every day so we get here early) I decided to stay behind and nap in the car.

CautiousBB,3b6rnj,whatgoesup56,2,Fri Jun 26 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"There is correlation with a 16DPO hCg level over 300 and a higher rate of viable pregnancies, so as long as your number is increasing appropriately you would be well over that threshold by 16DPO.  For reference, my 4 weeks/16DPO hCg level was 37... My 17DPO level was just under 300.  But I'm doing well now at 18+1 weeks with a very healthy, wriggly baby.  So not hitting the 300 at 16DPO is certainly no indicator that things won't go well.  In the earliest days, it helped to remind myself that nothing I did at that point in time would make a difference in the outcome.  Losses that early are by and large chromosomal, which was already predetermined at fertilization. I didn't let myself believe things would really go well until the NT scan, but I did start to feel a little better when a heartbeat was visible at 7 weeks and a heartbeat was found via Doppler at 10 weeks."

I talked to two friends, one who bleed out at 7 weeks and her little one is 2 years old and the other one bleed out at 20 weeks and he's 4 months.   Use a pad and see how much, if you're filling it in an hour I'd go to the emergency if you're not, as hard as it might be try and relax."

CautiousBB,3b4rui,whatgoesup56,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:14:23 2015 UTC,I know sometimes it's hard. And it's hard to just breath and be excited.   Of your pain is too much definitely go in and if you're still concerned a call to the health link or if you have something like that won't hurt. Usually they are over cautious and send you in but don't panic.   Here to chat if you need to keep your kind occupied

I'm wondering if something like anti-itch cream would help at all.  What I've been doing so far is using one of those peri bottles with a really dilute vinegar solution (1 T white vinegar to 1 cup water) cause I read that it could help with a yeast infection until I got in to the doctor (that's what I thought it was at first).  It seems to help a lot; I think the biggest issue is that your discharge is filled with the hormones, so it irritates your skin. IDK if the vinegar is needed; the water alone might be helping, since you'd be washing the discharge away.  When I go in on Tuesday, I'm going to ask if something like topical benadryl cream or vagisil cream might help; once I get an answer I'll get back to you, just in case :)"
CautiousBB,3b4f3y,Sharra_Blackfire,2,Thu Jun 25 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"I definitely find some days my skin is really irritated by the progesterone. I wear a panty liner during the day and try to ""air out"" as much as possible when I am at home. I always pack extra panty liners and some vaginal wipes in my purse. This way if I can deal with any discharge quickly and don't leave my skin exposed. At home I just use a clean washcloth and some water to clean the area. Every time I shower I make sure I get a good rinse so there is zero residue for a least a little while! Good luck."

CautiousBB,3b3wwu,futurecompanion11,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:15:34 2015 UTC,I feel you on this. I never got any extra energy in the second trimester so far. Also my nausea and vomiting still hasn't gone away completely. hooray for HG :/ But yea I'm a little over two weeks away from the 3rd trimester and I still feel very tired all the time.
CautiousBB,3b3wwu,septicidal,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"Have your iron levels been checked? (Not just your complete blood count, but the actual ferritin level.) Low iron can affect energy before it becomes outright anemia, and it's very common in the second trimester.  I hear you on the home remodeling woes.  We have planned a kitchen renovation for this summer and everything is horribly delayed.  And all of the other around-the-house projects have been put on hold ""until the kitchen is finished""... Which now won't be until mid-August.  I would suggest trying to cut yourself some slack.  If there's anything you can do to take some stress off of you - a friend who's willing to come over and help do dishes and put in laundry, using a grocery delivery service like Peapod so all you have to do is put the groceries away, a cleaning service... Go for it.  You are growing a human AND working full-time!  You are a rockstar! Of course you are tired.  My husband and I started using a cleaning service once a month while I was dealing with the stress and side effects from infertility treatments, and it was the best decision ever.  I don't have to worry about mopping the floors or scrubbing the tub (which probably should be done more than once a month, but that's what we can afford and I'm too tired to do it).  I've used Peapod for grocery delivery a number of times, especially when planning for holiday meals, and it has saved so much time and stress.  It's more than worth the $15 delivery fee for me, especially as a once-in-a-while thing.  If you have people using TaskRabbit in your area, you can also just post looking for someone to do certain tasks - say, $20 to spend an hour washing dishes and cleaning up part of the house.  Or picking up dry cleaning, or whatever other errand might be easy to pass along to someone else."
CautiousBB,3b3wwu,meepmeep1357,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:47:04 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain.  I maybe had about a couple of weeks during this pregnancy when I felt normal.  That's gone now.  My blood pressure is fine, but my energy level is zero.  The house is a pigsty, and I've been canceling all non-essential commitments because it's hard enough to just get my work done.  We've already hired a cleaning service to come in every couple of weeks to clean the place, but at this point, even the minor cleaning things are too much for me.  The dishes haven't been washed in at least 4 days."

CautiousBB,3b2v95,whatgoesup56,2,Thu Jun 25 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest that ER doc was a complete asshole.   (trigger warning)  I get he was trying to let me know all my options but he said ""you're hcg levels are too low for how far along you think you are and we can't find the baby on the ultrasound. This almost always results in a miscarriage. Or, you could just not be as far along as you thought. But don't worry miscarriage is normal and very common and not your fault.

They really space those out, even when you have a history of MC's and you're anxious :(  but I totally agree. I think when a girl gets her period and she goes to the OB for the first time, it should be a discussion if her blood type shows negative. In fact, it's not standard procedure for people to even be told their blood type unless they ask, which is a whole big WTF on its own"

CautiousBB,3b2v95,in2thewoods,3,Thu Jun 25 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more!!  I was also in the same sad situation last Christmas Eve when I was in the hospital with pregnancy #2 then just hours later being rolled into the ER for an ectopic.  Rhogam was never discussed in my 1st pregnancy and it was until I was having issues with #2 that my blood was taken and they noted I would need a rhogam shot.  Sometimes I wonder if my blood type and low progesterone caused my first MC.  But I have read that it is common to get the shot later in the pregnancy, about the 28th week."
CautiousBB,3b2v95,in2thewoods,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's common to get the shot later in pregnancy when you've already had a shot before, or your pregnancy is already proving to be successful with no spotting. My OB said that since it's been such a long time since I had my last shot and child, that if I were to start spotting they would give me a new shot right away (and they had no answer when I asked them why they shouldn't just do it right then, preventatively, just in case)  The problem that I've seen, anecdotally, is that women aren't told before they even start TTC, or even when they have a MC they aren't asked their blood type or told about the possibilities of the Rh factors involvement, maybe because if they told someone who just had a MC that it might have been due to something preventable, they would have trouble on their hands.  Like, I don't know. It just seems shady and weird to me that it isn't on the lips of every OB out there."
CautiousBB,3b2v95,in2thewoods,2,Thu Jun 25 15:14:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly!!  Now that I know what I know, this pregnancy is going much better.

CautiousBB,3b2v95,vibeee,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I think we will wait for the standard ultrasound.

CautiousBB,3b2v95,vibeee,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"You're both right. You typically get the shot around 28 weeks, and then after you deliver (in a ""normal"" pregnancy). Source: birth doula, 3-peat client needed to get the shots all three pregnancies."

If I didn't ask for it, remind my nurses it wouldn't been missed on multiple occasions.    I also think they should look into a better solution than to send a woman in the middle of the miscarriage to L&D to get the shot.  Most OB/RE offices don't administer the blood unless they are located in the same building as the hospital."

CautiousBB,3b2v95,Devioussmile,2,Thu Jun 25 15:44:29 2015 UTC,It's an experience.  It was rough at times.  But after 2-3 losses you just go on and keep fighting.  It really changes your expectations and becomes a process like getting rid of cancer.  The worst part is that I never found out why it didn't work.  I ended up using donor eggs and succeeding on first try.   You can't win if you don't fight!

CautiousBB,3b2v95,frkfrosk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:15:41 2015 UTC,I always tell people that I aced my blood tests too since my blood type is A+
CautiousBB,3b2v95,rcrumbsinmybed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:29:36 2015 UTC,I'm Canadian too and my family doctor (who will be delivering my baby) told me about it when we discussed trying to conceive. The hospital also made sure I had my shot when I miscarried last time so I am feeling pretty fortunate they were on the ball! Although I guess I didn't Ace my blood test.. O- :P lol
CautiousBB,3b2v95,rcrumbsinmybed,2,Thu Jun 25 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"The only reason I've known my blood type since I was 18 is because I'm a blood donor and the Red Cross gives you a donor card with your blood type on it. Otherwise, I know I've had a blood type test run every time I've been pregnant but only one doctor has mentioned what it was to me (I'm A+). At least they were checking.  If you're interested in RhoGAM and Rhesus disease, read about James Harrison, ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" who is the reason we have RhoGAM shots to treat Rh- pregnant women, thanks to his unusual plasma.  Like you, I don't understand why information about Rhesus disease is not more commonly known especially now since we have an effective treatment for it."
CautiousBB,3b2v95,melissarose8585,2,Fri Jun 26 12:04:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't had this experience. I'm type B- and the hospital made sure to give me a rhogam shot when I miscarried (unrelated to blood type). During this pregnancy my doctor let me know after my first round of blood work to go to the ER immediately at the sign of any blood and that I will receive another shot at my 27 week appointment which is scheduled.  It's unfortunate that many others aren't educated about it, because you're right, it can literally save a life!"
CautiousBB,3b2v95,melissarose8585,2,Thu Jun 25 16:38:23 2015 UTC,Were they able to figure out what did cause the miscarriage with that one?
CautiousBB,3b2v95,melissarose8585,2,Thu Jun 25 16:52:07 2015 UTC,It was a blighted ovum and most likely was an issue with the sperm or egg or both during fertilization but there's no way to know for sure. I didn't have any indication that anything was wrong until my 12 week ultrasound so I'm pretty sure rH factor wasn't at play in that case.  I haven't had any bleeding issues this pregnancy either and I'm at 24+3 thankfully. My husband is rH+ so rhogam is a must!
CautiousBB,3b2v95,Arrowmatic,2,Thu Jun 25 18:03:38 2015 UTC,I'm so glad your pregnancy has been issue free and that you're so far along!! I'll keep positive thoughts for you :)
CautiousBB,3b2v95,Arrowmatic,2,Fri Jun 26 12:57:04 2015 UTC,My OB told me as soon as she found out my blood type was O- (First apt after blood tests). She told me I will be getting the shot at about 28 weeks and likely again after birth. This is my first pregnancy.

I am calming myself by listening to Milky Chance on my lap top. It's so surreal. I am scared, grateful, petrified, nervous, happy, sad, excited, frozen in fear, giddy, relieved, frustrated, uncomfortable, ready, not-ready......None of that matters though, because I am about to meet my twins regardless!!!

Sorry about the awful symptoms but hopefully you can relax knowing hormonal things are happening!
CautiousBB,3b26x4,Oneofthese3,2,Thu Jun 25 14:08:40 2015 UTC,My mom has a theory. I went home from work because I felt so awful and I decided to call her to cry on the phone for support. Anywhoo she's amazing and her theory is that because I was so scared my baby was not alive I didn't let myself feel anything for days.  Now that I know  everything is fine she says I somehow opened up the floodgates and am finally allowing myself to have all the symptoms.   And honestly inside I am screaming with joy of how awful I feel.   I hope you will have your good news soon too :)

So I've sunk to a new low: overall shorts. But hey, our plans today include strawberry picking and swimming, so if you can't rock the overall shorts there, where can you?"
CautiousBB,3b26x4,edition,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:31:20 2015 UTC,Oh mind sharing where you got them?  I would love those!  Have fun strawberry picking - we're doing the same today!
CautiousBB,3b26x4,lancealittle,2,Thu Jun 25 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Lol I got them in the fat man section of Walmart (seriously -- this might be the only thing I've bought at walmart, after checking every other store in town and figuring that overalls are out-of-style enough to be virtually unfindable). Also, I got them circa December 2010 when I was in the exact same part of my last pregnancy and they were real overalls until I cut off the legs this morning. So I guess that makes them even cooler -- overall cutoff shorts.  Also also -- picking strawberries in the third trimester sucks balls. Sorry for your partner. Probably will suck for you too if you feel shitty and dizzy. I already went last week so I was prepared for the suckage today, but bending over/squatting/crawling are all pretty awful for me right now. But we got another 11 pounds of strawberries to put in the freezer so it's not all bad!"
CautiousBB,3b26x4,edition,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"Ha!  As a former art school student, I have an affinity for overalls but haven't owned them in years.  They just seem so...functional.  Kudos to you for making them work for you all this time!  I might go to one of those uniform stores and buy some painting ones.  You're right.  The strawberry picking was a lot of work.  Our 5yo loved it but it was definitely the peak of physical activity for the day for us.  Envious of your 11 lbs though (we managed about 2)."

She's 34 weeks today.    We've spent the last week framing a wall and hanging drywall for baby's new room...all by ourselves.  She got zapped twice trying to reroute some electrical and scared the hell out of me in the smelly fog of burnt wires - so I called my dad to come over for the rest of the wiring.  He's a contractor but very much about us learning these things - he did offer to help us carry the 8 ft drywall up the stairs, but we declined.

CautiousBB,3b26x4,palmtree23,5,Fri Jun 26 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Such a rough 12 hours. Yesterday I had a very successful ultrasound: baby measured 8 weeks at 7+5 and we saw a glorious HB in the 150-160 range. Should have been reassuring, right? And I get queasy but not enough to justify a Zofran... first day in two weeks I could go without. Well, last night, my boobs decided they were done being tender. I battled extreme nausea and ate a bowl of pasta for dinner: holy shit, I ate an ENORMOUS bowl like it was nothing, it tasted amazing with no nausea immediately after like I get every time I eat. I fell asleep and woke up at 1am feeling PERFECT. Not a trace of nausea, I couldn't get my boobs to feel anything with the most vicious purple nurple attacks, etc... I was panicked. I told my husband I knew something was wrong. All of my symptoms had totally disappeared. He gently tried to coax me into sanity and failed... so he got a little frustrated and went back to sleep. I played unsuccessfully with the Doppler for a while. Finally I fell asleep, feeling certain that I'd have to email my doctor in the morning and address my concerns.  Woke up this morning and have been viciously vomiting ever since. Everywhere. Train station, work, etc. And my boobies are killing me. I choked down a Zofran and am feeling sheepishly relieved. I knew that I'd have a tough week as I approached the time I lost the last pregnancy, but this is just too much. We are going on a trip next weekend and I'm hoping that helps distract me until my next ultrasound in 13 days!"

I call the place, they say there's been a paperwork issue, they'll call me right back.  11 am I get a call back and they will deliver first thing tomorrow morning.  Awesome.  I go to bed, planning to sleep from like 11:30 to ~6pm.  2 in the afternoon, the dogs barking like crazy and someone's banging on the door.  It's the delivery guy.    By the time he gets stuff installed, broken one taken away, I get the dog settled down - It's 3:30 pm and I cannot get back to sleep.  Point is, it's going to be a loooooooong overnight shift at work after ~3 hours and change of sleep.  I miss being able to mainline coffee."

We told them as I work for my FIL and needed the time for the cycle and didn't know how to get it without being honest. What happened was they found out right away but we told them we weren't telling until after the harmony test. End result? When we started telling there was so much pressure to tell and who to tell and how to tell and why am I not acting excited?? (This included tears from MIL). For them they'd been keeping it a secret for two months, and were cracking. It was too much pressure for me and it's been hard!"

I know it isn't the result you wanted but maybe in those 10-12 days, when you get your next ultrasound you'll get to see a reassuring little blobby in there! I've got fingers & toes crossed for you."
CautiousBB,3azaug,k2p2,2,Wed Jun 24 19:06:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just need to try my hardest to stay positive until then, that will be my biggest obstacle."
CautiousBB,3azaug,waywardmoon,2,Wed Jun 24 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Meh, that's difficult :( But if your OB didnt seem concerned at all that sounds good!!  Do you track your ovulation at all? I am sure I will be in your place next week, I know my first one is too early!"
CautiousBB,3azaug,autumnx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"I half-heartedly tracked ovulation. My cycle has always been irregular and the one time I used a couple of opks I only got a ""close but not for sure"" sort of test. I didn't temp because my 18 month old was nursing (this is before he weaned this month) and I was up and down a lot through the night."
CautiousBB,3azaug,panandacub,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes just a sac can be a blighted ovum, which I had, but those almost always bleed on their own. If you see no blood until your next appointment, that's great! Stay positive. A lot of women miscalculate."
CautiousBB,3azaug,palmtree23,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:21:53 2015 UTC,Well I haven't bled any so hopefully that means nothing bad yet.
CautiousBB,3azaug,neontygerr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I was hoping for good news! Try to stay busy these next 10-12 days, although that's way easier said than done!"

Talk to your doctor-- mine assured me that as long as I'm not in pain and not bleeding, I should relax, and it's likely everything is fine. All the best!"
CautiousBB,3azs2n,howverycleverofyou,2,Wed Jun 24 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you :-) I ended up calling my doctor and they told me the same thing. That I should enjoy the moments with no fatigue or nausea, that if I'm not bleeding I shouldn't worry."

CautiousBB,3az3a6,neontygerr,5,Wed Jun 24 17:34:28 2015 UTC,Call your doctor! Could be nothing or something but they'll tell you what they want and it'll put you most at ease knowing exactly what your doctor's advice is!
CautiousBB,3az3a6,mrswhiskerson,2,Wed Jun 24 17:40:18 2015 UTC,I'd def say to call.  Please update!
CautiousBB,3az3a6,waywardmoon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"If in doubt - call! I hope everything is alright. It's probably nothing, but always a good idea to err on the side of caution."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,k2p2,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:59 2015 UTC,"If you had sex recently, this could be very normal. I had a gush of blood at 12 weeks that was unexplained. Definitely call your OB but don't freak out about it. I would rest until you hear back."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,autumnx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"I am still spotting and have been for almost a week now. I am waiting it out. Brown, rust colored and small clots. I am still sick as a dog so I am pretty sure I am still pregnant. I decided to worry when it is red and a lot. That's just where I am right now."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,notantisocial,2,Wed Jun 24 23:38:12 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping our spotting stops soon! I'm the same, I am trying not to worry until it turns red."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,notantisocial,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:08:01 2015 UTC,Mine seems to have more or less stopped. Morning sickness however has continued.
CautiousBB,3az3a6,Grave_Girl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'd call, this far in.  There are reasonable things that could have caused it, but extra reassurance isn't a bad thing."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,Arrowmatic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"If you saw the doctor yesterday and they were poking around in there, it's possible your cervix got irritated. I had a little bit of spotting a couple of days after my last TV ultrasound and apparently it's not uncommon."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,cool_side_of_pillow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"Did it subside? I wanted to say that after one of my ultrasounds I had brown spotting and discharge, due to them irritating my cervix. The technician pushed hard! Then it went away."
CautiousBB,3az3a6,cool_side_of_pillow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:12:15 2015 UTC,It hasn't subsided yet...and I didn't have any sort of vaginal exam done at my check up. The only thing that could have irritated my cervix was sex a few days ago. Did you end up going in to get it checked out?
CautiousBB,3az2gh,MakinABaby,3,Wed Jun 24 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"I'm currently 8+1, and my nausea started on 6+3. I spent that whole weekend lying on the couch, trying to sleep away the nausea (LPT: it doesn't work). I find that 100% cranberry juice (as it's both sweet & tart) helps with nausea immensely, especially first thing in the morning.    I had brown spotting on & off my last pregnancy too (which ultimately resulted in a complete MC @ 8+5), so the teensy little bit I had this Monday & Tuesday was very anxiety-producing. Thankfully it has stopped for me. I really hope your body chills out & yours stops too!"
CautiousBB,3az2gh,brycedoula,2,Thu Jun 25 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"Closing in on 7 weeks here too, just starting to get a little nausea here and there... Hope your preggie pops help!! It's so frustrating to not feel yourself at work.  I wish I could offer you some advice or comfort regarding the rest of it, but I know how hard it is to relax. Have you talked to your doctor?"
CautiousBB,3az2gh,howverycleverofyou,2,Wed Jun 24 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"I emailed my regular nurse practitioner. She doesn't actually do OB, but I am with her until after my ultrasound. Her nurse answered and said if I was bleeding I should go to the emergency room.  Since I'm not actually bleeding I thought that was a gross overreaction. I'm just going to wait it out unless I start actually bleeding."
CautiousBB,3az2gh,howverycleverofyou,2,Wed Jun 24 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh, that is so tough. That's what they told me too until I must have annoyed them so much they figured they better placate me. :\ I hope all is well."
CautiousBB,3az2gh,Grave_Girl,2,Wed Jun 24 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"I hope the bleeding is nothing.  It's something I can't be sanguine about either; I have spotting quite a bit, but the miscarriage started out just the same as the ones that went fine.    I hope the preggie pops help you.  From reading the package at Babies R Us, the key ingredient seems to really be the citric acid, and that's present in a fair amount of other things if you want to try something in the interim.  I've had fair luck with lemon juice in water (as good as anything else) and know some people who've had luck with Seabands.  They didn't work for me, but since you just wear them it won't hurt to try."
CautiousBB,3az2gh,lancealittle,2,Wed Jun 24 23:39:52 2015 UTC,bleeding is . . . something I can't be sanguine about   Pun intended? Because I snorted a little bit . . .
CautiousBB,3az2gh,Grave_Girl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:03:07 2015 UTC,I couldn't resist.
CautiousBB,3az2gh,notantisocial,2,Thu Jun 25 01:04:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I love lemon juice in water, so I definitely think I'll give that a try."
CautiousBB,3az8uz,howverycleverofyou,3,Wed Jun 24 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"For whats its worth, we saw a heartbeat once at 6w, and once at 7.  With levels that high, chances are good there will definitely be something"
CautiousBB,3az8uz,dutchqueen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the optimism! I hope so :)
CautiousBB,3az8uz,waywardmoon,2,Thu Jun 25 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, I know how you feel - I am still peeing on sticks and its really annoying DH. He keeps warning me that its as probably as dark as they will get and if one has less dye I'll probably freak out.  Good luck on your ultrasound! Those HCG levels sound great!"
CautiousBB,3az8uz,whatgoesup56,2,Wed Jun 24 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds weird but if one is faint, dilute your urine with water and it will be darker.   Did this myself"
CautiousBB,3az8uz,k2p2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"If you can, I highly recommend stopping yourself from peeing on things!! It's only served to make me a nervous wreck :)  Check out some of these articles if you're nervous and good luck to you!"
CautiousBB,3az8uz,autumnx,2,Wed Jun 24 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Let's hope your far enough along that you can see something! I know how nervous I was before my first scan (at 8w). Good luck!!
CautiousBB,3az8uz,palmtree23,2,Wed Jun 24 19:08:08 2015 UTC,Don't take any more pregnancy tests. No point. Your HCG level = beautiful!
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,omnomkittah,3,Wed Jun 24 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely that you'd still have HCG in your system from a month ago, but not completely impossible. I'd wait another week and go see your GYN."
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,autumnx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:31:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,ls1006,3,Wed Jun 24 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"No personal experience. I'm sorry you had  a bad doc office experience. I've read it can stay a while, but varies by individual. Maybe test in a couple days to see if the test gets darker? This might be a time to push to actually see a doc. Maybe they can confirm buy blood work to get a more accurate result. Seems like you wouldn't ovulate if HCG was still strong enough to give a positive....but that's just how it feels to me. Sorry I can't help!"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,ls1006,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:10:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input!  You're probably right that it's time to go to the doctors to get things confirmed.  I feel like the line is darker today than it ever got before my miscarriage.. so maybe that's a good sign?  I can't imagine the line would be darker this far out.. but I'm also scared to get my hopes up if its just residual hcg from last time :(
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,ls1006,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:27:31 2015 UTC,"I would also be inclined to think darker is better, but I think pushing for a doc is important! I've never understood why OB/GYN's are the only ones that decided when to see you. Every other doctor's office I ever call just gets me in. I feel like from a gynecological not OB perspective you should be able to make sure all is well with your body! Be your own advocate (something they should assist with but don't)!"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,waywardmoon,2,Wed Jun 24 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"Your absolutely right for sure.  I think I'll wait a few days and if it's still positive I'll push to see my doctor.  She's actually a really great supportive doctor, but getting past her secretary to get an appointment in the first place is a totally different manner.  If I didn't like my doctor so much I would switch for that alone."
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,Sharra_Blackfire,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Office staff can make a huge difference, I'm glad she's good in general!!!  Sending lots of love!"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,Arrowmatic,2,Wed Jun 24 16:16:55 2015 UTC,"My last CP didnt make it to five weeks but I remember the tests went negative really quickly.  That morning I took a test and it was barely there and then a few hours later began bleeding.  My HCG was checked and it had went down to 34 so she rechecked 2 - 3 days later and it was 4, so it seems to go away pretty quickly but I am sure it can vary from woman to woman... I would think your positive is legit though.  I hope it is! Grats!"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,Grave_Girl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  I'm so nervous to be optimistic, I hope that's the case!"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,maybebabyg,2,Wed Jun 24 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd switch OB's to an office that's more caring before going in for this one"
CautiousBB,3ayb7s,SuckingDiesel,2,Wed Jun 24 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it could go either way, but the easy way to confirm is HCG betas to see if your levels are rising appropriately. I was still testing positive a month or so after my miscarriage but that was at 8 weeks."
CautiousBB,3awacu,rocket_lady,15,Wed Jun 24 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be anywhere but where you are. You certainly don't owe it to anyone to work up bubbly excitement over an experience that has brought you nothing but sadness and physical discomfort thus far. I hope this pregnancy is the one. There will be no day or moment when you can be certain you're bringing home a baby, but as the weeks slip by you will realize that the notion isn't so crazy anymore. And you know what? It's also ok to be hopeful for something that so many people get to experience in a more effortless way. As you get (hopefully) reassuring news month after month, it's ok to think about baby things and names. If something goes wrong, it will hurt and be hard either way. I hope you can find some little things to enjoy about this pregnancy because you ARE pregnant.  That said, why do seagulls fly by the sea?  Because if they flew by the bay they'd be bagels."
CautiousBB,3awacu,lancealittle,2,Wed Jun 24 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Oh dear lord, I want bagels something fierce now."
CautiousBB,3awacu,ReigningPotatoes,2,Wed Jun 24 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"So much all of this, I had 3 losses before this pregnancy and at 25 weeks I'm just more cautiously optimistic and feeling a little excited. Every scan and doctor's appointment has made me nervous. Over time though it will hopefully get better and you'll settle in to it."
CautiousBB,3awacu,nonspecificwife,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:01:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing! I feel a lot of anxiety every time I go to the OB and it shows in my blood pressure. Glad I'm not alone!
CautiousBB,3awacu,nonspecificwife,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:26:33 2015 UTC,I have an anxiety disorder that I stopped medicating as soon as I found out I was pregnant. It's been so hard to not freak out constantly but I'm getting there. I have a little celebration every week that progresses.
CautiousBB,3awacu,Scandinavel,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:41:48 2015 UTC,I love that joke! It's also a favorite of my father-in-law. He is a funny guy.  I am so jealous of all the effortless pregnancies that seem to surround me. So. Very. Green.

CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,2,Wed Jun 24 15:26:11 2015 UTC,Thank you!
CautiousBB,3axucr,tinameri,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:47:37 2015 UTC,It's barely 80 where I am and I'm already over the heat.  Lol it's gonna be a long summer!
CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"It's in the mid 80's and humid, which is not typical for Colorado. It's going to be a VERY long summer!"
CautiousBB,3axucr,panandacub,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:47:33 2015 UTC,Ew! That is NOT typical for CO (I grew up there and miss it all the time). You're looking great though!
CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:50:08 2015 UTC,You did?! Thank you so much!
CautiousBB,3axucr,panandacub,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"I did! I grew up in Highlands Ranch and went to college at CSU! My husband is in the Navy so we're moving around a lot right now, but we hope to end up there when he's done!"

CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:13:01 2015 UTC,It has but it still has that great feel about it.

CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,2,Wed Jun 24 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"I love it here, but summers are definitely different when you're told no hiking or 4-wheelig. Oh well, it's totally worth it.  Thank you so much!"
CautiousBB,3axucr,aintnochickenwing,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah last time I was there a few years ago, my arthritis was really bad and I couldn't do any hiking. So I mostly just drove around to all the cool places I could (Mount Evans was my fave). But I just love the atmosphere there! So different from Atlanta."
CautiousBB,3axucr,TheFinalFrontier47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"Adorable pic! My hair has pretty much been permanently up for the last 2 months, haha. And I don't see that changing anytime soon, considering the regular 90+ temps and ridiculous humidity."
CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,2,Wed Jun 24 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I wish I could tame my wavy/curly hair, but it's so much easier just putting it up."
CautiousBB,3axucr,TheFinalFrontier47,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, mine is wavy, too, and super thick, so I just give up in the summer. I have even fewer fucks to give now that I'm preggo. Haha."
CautiousBB,3axucr,chels213,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Haha! Me too! It takes every ounce of strength I have to get out of bed and actually get dressed for work
CautiousBB,3axucr,lancealittle,2,Wed Jun 24 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"29 weeks and feeling suddenly, undeniably, and irrevocably pregnant. Now if baby would stop flipping in and out of breech I would be thrilled -- not only am I SO over the full cervical assaults, I'm starting to get stressed about how much I want to try for a vbac, and that having a repeat c/s because of positioning might send me into a tailspin after this delivery just like it did with my first. I am already going to have to be separated from the baby for at least a day after delivery, we can't start BFing right away, we're going to be hours from home & friends, there's question about whether the baby will even be healthy at birth, I just want this one thing to go OK."
CautiousBB,3axucr,tinameri,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"Just breathe!  I'm sure baby will cooperate eventually,  they just love to keep us on our toes.  Good luck mama,  I hope the vbac is an option for you"

CautiousBB,3audfk,ls1006,2,Tue Jun 23 16:28:54 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry! I hope the shot goes fast and sweet baby holds on a little while!
CautiousBB,3audfk,humanistbeing,2,Tue Jun 23 18:51:38 2015 UTC,Your description sounds awful (but nice writing!).  I had a hard time just with IV antibiotics for GBS with my first and that was mixed with a bunch of saline on a slow drip to make it better.  I hope you don't have to have any more for a while and/or that your placenta heals up and you're no longer at risk of pre-term labor.  Hugs!
CautiousBB,3audfk,chels213,2,Tue Jun 23 19:55:31 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I've heard that antibiotics hurt loads too.
CautiousBB,3audfk,k2p2,2,Tue Jun 23 20:03:54 2015 UTC,Sending you lots of love and prayers that baby is great and stays in there as long as possible. I hope you're ok and your placenta isn't ruptured!  Xoxo
