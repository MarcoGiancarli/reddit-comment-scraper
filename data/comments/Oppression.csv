Oppression,3do0ok,eberkneezer,8,Fri Jul 17 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"Haha astute observation.  I don't know but it's quite terrifying isn't it? He escalated so quickly and easily into despicable abuse that I felt like I was on 4chan or xbox live, but I was actually talking to a moderator. Really big eye opener.   I checked through some of his comment history and /u/anansi73 definitely enjoys throwing his weight around. You'd expect /r/racism to be more open-minded and liberal, but they ban people even talking about matters such as reverse racism - something that I observed from a brief peruse of the offending mods comment history. I was never a participant in that subreddit before posting the comic.  I think the worst thing about this is that I thought anansi73 was some sort of rogue mod. A rotten apple that had somehow continued to prosper, but after having received no response from any of the moderators on that subreddit I'm starting to think they could all be the same. Power corrupts and all that."
Oppression,3do0ok,ChaosMotor,6,Fri Jul 17 23:43:01 2015 UTC,they ban people even talking about matters such as reverse racism   Tut. There is no such thing as reverse racism. There is only racism. To even try to create a special class for racism against whites is itself a type of setting-apart that is racist by its nature.

Oppression,3do0ok,stupernan1,11,Sat Jul 18 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"I posted a comic to a subreddit that I believe was unfairly deleted. When I questioned why I was instantly banned by /u/anansi73. His tone was very condescending, authoritarian and he was clearly high on power.  Here are the initial responses  I was banned immediately afterwards. A group mod mail was sent as of 24 hours ago and has been ignored by all of the moderators. That is when I received the hate mail from /u/anansi73.  I replied to him that I had reported his behaviour and was met with childish responses.  Are these the kinds of people allowed to moderate subreddits? It just goes to show that the ones who seek power are usually the most sociopathic.  There are around 8 moderators on /r/racism and not one of them has replied yet either. I had faith in them that they would keep order in their house.   Maybe /u/yellowmix , the head moderator would be willing to comment in this forum instead of privately."

Also, I never said I would report you in the original mod mail. I requested an explanation as to why I had been banned whilst simultaneously pointing out your bad behaviour to the other mods.

My sense of authority is not false.  It's actually based upon the fact that I'm a mod of the sub that you posted on.    Your comic was about how staring at Muslim women isn't necessarily racist, as you're most likely wondering what their tits look like under their burquas.  Not only is that an immensely sophomoric joke, its punchline, objectifying women, completely contradicts the ideals of intersectionality that /r/racism is based upon.  The way that you present your actions is immensely disingenuous.  I honestly can't tell if you are intentionally obfuscating your assholery, or if you really are just kinda dumb and tone deaf.  Either way, there is no place for you at /r/racism.  Your ban will not be overturned.  The other mods will not feel sympathy for you.  Shit . . . I'm one of the more lenient mods.  I even told you in the thread that I was giving you the benefit of the doubt (we often ban for first offenses due to the levels of trolling and brigading that we receive).  You couldn't just leave it at that, you had to have the last word.  This is how you responded:  The benefit of what doubt? This sub is about racism and the comic takes the issue of the perception of racism and tackles it. How dare you be so condescending and patronising. My post was not trolling or racist.  I give you a second chance and you throw it back at me.  You call me condescending and patronizing.  So . . . fuck you, you're banned.  You don't have a right to post on /r/racism.  Your sense of entitlement is blinding you to reality.  But anyway, by all means, report me.  Go see what that does for your situation.  Now fuck off, you petulant little shit."

Oppression,3do0ok,GypsyPunk,7,Sun Jul 19 15:15:44 2015 UTC,"The punchline and your opinion on it is irrelevant. /r/racism deals with the issue of race, not gender issues -although I would argue against your claims that this is offensive but that's not connected to this particular discussion.   If your sophomoric mind chose to only see the punchline then that is another example of your over confidence with regards to your intelligence and decision making abilities. There are many people in the world who are so afraid of being labelled as a racist that they are too terrified to converse or interact with others who are different from themselves. This is a huge issue that gets overlooked by the groups of people that believe they are the victims of racism. They often fail to put themselves in other people's shoes. The people who aren't racist, aren't malicious but are so terrified of putting their foot in it because it's been turned into such a sensitive issue that the fear that is instilled in them changes their behaviour, makes them seem weird and consequently, make the usual victims of racism perceive that person as racist.  The comic was using light-hearted humour to illustrate a very serious issue concerning racism. I'm not surprised that the broader, more serious issues that this comic highlighted went completely over your head. You, a person that resorts to abuse and swearing as a first port of call.  I asked multiple times for an explanation as to why I was banned:  1) In the thread itself.  2) In multiple group mod mails.  3) In private.  You ignored a simple, understandable request and sent me hate mail. Only now that you have been called out in a public thread do you attempt to provide an answer, yet still you attack me even then. Anyone here can see your true face that showed itself in the private messages compared to the semi-reasonable face you have brought here."

Oppression,3ddgxp,eberkneezer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:03 2015 UTC,"Nice find.   Don't you think Voat is doing the same thing of saying stuff related to free speech and no to censorship simply for the purpose of marketing?  When the time comes who knows what the reality will be?    There has already been some reality there with the closure of a few of their subverses and bannings.    A lot of the stuff from voat and voat users looks like propaganda to me and lacks substance and this poster could easily have had a goat on it and told people to go to voat. At the moment, Voat just looks like another time bomb mirroring reddit.  It now has investors expecting a return on their investment in the long term and the original owner slowly loosing control to share holders, partners and commercial interests.    A credible free speech platform would be able to explain its claims.  e.g. it might take the form of a non-profit foundation like Wikipedia with clear principles.... or maybe it might take the form of a technologically decentralised system.  Even just a reddit copycat with a clear and absolute member charter (independent of CEO) outlining the ""free speech"" guarantees would make sense to differentiate it from other attempst.  I'm sure they will come but then we will also witness how most people don't really care enough about absolute freedom to support it."
Oppression,3ddgxp,eberkneezer,-1,Wed Jul 15 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"No, Atko genuinely believes in free speech, and is doing what he can to establish a viable, sustainable free speech community while getting attacked from all sides by some very unethical and hateful people and groups. Part of the design of the site, from the bottom up, is intended to slow down or prevent attacks by such people and groups.  Also, if you can seriously claim that the SJW-controlled propaganda mouthpiece that is Wikipedia has any credibility whatsoever, you've already lost the debate."
Oppression,3ddgxp,eberkneezer,0,Wed Jul 15 13:51:06 2015 UTC,", Atko genuinely believes in free speech, and is doing what he can to establish a viable, sustainable free speech community while getting attacked from all sides by some very unethical and hateful people and groups.    What actually makes you think Atko believes in free speech?  What makes you believe he just isn't saying what he needs to and using the negative attention on his project to his advantage.  Voat wouldn't have any market differentiation if it did not go down the route it has.   Voat would get no press attention or reddit attention if it did not suffer various attacks and difficulties.  So good luck to him for defining voat in the marketspace but I don't see how that relates to his personal beliefs.  e.g. Do you have evidence of him protesting about reddit and driving transparency on reddit or elsewhere in the same way like /u/go1dfish.   That would support your character reference.  Remember, voat has evolved to include partners and investors.  This is the result of the funding model he has chosen.  So even if you trust an individual, you have to look at the business model they are setting up.   I'm not confident he has chosen a sustainable model if the aim is free speech in the long term.  There certainly isn't enough public information to make the marketing/propaganda type claims that I often read about voat.  Also look at reddit.  Alexis or Steve Huffman and before that Ellen Pao are at the mercy of the board.  So individuals do not matter that much but the system is everything.   Also, if you can seriously claim that the SJW-controlled propaganda mouthpiece that is Wikipedia has any credibility whatsoever, you've already lost the debate.   I'm talking about the business model and funding strategy.  So a donation funded reddit-clone similar to wikipedia with a clear aim of allowing free speech. This would get away from things like the need to please advertisers and grow massively.   Shouting ""SJW"" to dismiss stuff just shows a lack debating skills on your part."
Oppression,3ddgxp,eberkneezer,0,Wed Jul 15 16:02:16 2015 UTC,Everything he's said and done so far aligns with a genuine desire for a free speech community. Do you have any evidence otherwise? No. So you're just poisoning the well.  The funding model doesn't matter. Wikipedia has that funding model and has been infiltrated and corrupted by SJWs. That funding model clearly can't protect an institution.

That is when a loud segment of the population will start rattling the cage bars.  I tell you one thing though. Yishans most recent post did not help the situation. It made things far harder for spez and kn0thing to get fair treatment.   As far as people being tired of rioting, I doubt it. We will have had almost 2 weeks to recover."

My first thought was, ""Maybe that's because Ayn Rand fans are so annoying.""   Bear with me. What I mean by that is, ""far more annoying than Rand herself and her work.""   Really, bear with me--just a sec. I went to Hillsdale College. You can imagine how she and her work are all but universally adored there. So much so that having an ""Ayn Rand Society"" student group seems really redundant which brings me to my point. Anyone who would join such a group at such a school is, be honest, probably intolerably obnoxious. The phrase ""rabid fan"" comes to mind--like sports fans or Tolkien fans.   For example: Someone put up mock flyers around campus promoting an upcoming meeting stating members would exhume her corpse and have sex with it. Even if you love Ayn Rand (as I do) you can see how funny that is but they had no sense of humor about themselves which reinforced the ""Ayn Rand fan"" stigma.   In many cases, it may be unjust but we kind of just have to accept it. As long as ""Christian movies"" and ""Christian rock"" suck (for the most part ... at least the stuff the general public is exposed to ... I know there's great stuff out there) and no one seems willing to make a good film adaption of Rand's novels, we can't fault others for thinking we're all nutjobs."

In the state of nature, your property is that property you are able to defend. That is truly a noble pursuit for a race and earns her a seat at the table with all the mental giants in history.  But still, fuck /r/philosophy for banning her. When someone has a dumb idea, tell them. Ayn Rand is an idiot. You should take every opportunity you can to remind anyone delusional enough to think that they are so independent that their life would be better in the complete absence of the state and hold them up as an example to other people.  Preaching bad philosophy is like preaching bad religion at a party.

Oppression,3cb33j,KrustyKoonKrackers,3,Mon Jul 6 15:31:03 2015 UTC,The user interface is his.  The moderation log itself is just an RSS feed from reddit.  It could be pumped out to twitter or google docs easily.
Oppression,3cb33j,eberkneezer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly and it's not even the only solution. The way we do it in /r/european is a double layered transparency.   Each moderator is required to always leave a distinguished (make it easier to see) comment underneath any comment they remove with a reason to the removal and what rule was broken. The same applies for any removed submissions Each removal is posted by a bot to /r/removalseuropean   This means that any removal will always have an explanation to it. Each removal will be shown in the transparency log. Any subscriber can at any time go to the log and see what is removed and for what reason. If they disagree they can message the mods. If the mods don't agree and there's no consensus the user can make a public thread in the subs bringing the matter to the community.  The only reason we keep ourselves in the transparency log as moderators is in case personal information is shared. That cannot be allowed to stay in the log either. This is a weak link and we know it, but thankfully we have users who monitor us all the time and would notice if anything just got deleted from the moderation log. I've also made it clear that if I catch any moderator deleting anything from the mod log they'll be kicked.  A solution I've thought about to this dilemma is to ask a completely neutral party to be the mod of that place so that there's no way in hell the mods could remove anything. I had intended to ask go1dfish to be that but he's now shadowbanned. But for now we do it like such that if someone wants to see a screenshot of every incident in the mod log we provide them with that.  These are all the actions in the moderation log of our transparency log now: http://i.imgur.com/5ILYssE.png"

It's the only way to ensure that the sub stays true to its cause. There are many who'd fit that bill. These two I can vouch for with own experience that would fit that bill:  /u/mcctaggart /u/erowidtrance    It's another question if they'd like to if asked. I could take a non active role if needed (man that sounded bias). All my moderation and /u/erowidtrance's in /r/european are visible in our transparency log: https://www.reddit.com/r/removalseuropean  A transparency log like that is also needed for SRC. On top of that the rules need to be written so that they are clear and do not leave any room for mod-mood-swings or their personal opinions.  This whole new ""what is cancer is extremely flawed"":   What isn't cancer: Getting banned for breaking a sub's rules. Modding a lot of subs. Unless the mod is using their position to affect change sitewide, the number of subs modded is of no consequence. A mod removing current reposts and off-topic submissions, or removing content to enforce a sub's theme. Don't go to /r/aww and expect to be allowed to post something better suited for /r/wtf.     It's like it was written to ensure that some of the SRC mods wouldn't be called cancer themselves. All the other holes in those rules I already mentioned over at SRC.    Fact is that SRC is currently in the state where it still can save itself. But if that isn't done quickly it's gone and done. We've seen this happen before on reddit. Once you let shit like this get a hold, it grows and takes over."
Oppression,3c6les,RamblinRambo3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:14:03 2015 UTC,Who do you think is moderating to enforce political correctness? You have an odd view of the intentions of the mods- no one is PC police and that would never be tolerated.   I'm fully in support of a public modlog.
Oppression,3c6les,KrustyKoonKrackers,0,Mon Jul 6 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"These new changes can only be seen as an effort to form the community into a brainless mod through rules that are vague. It's the first step in any sub going belly up.   Who do you think is moderating to enforce political correctness?   I don't know. But these changes are an indicator that someone is pushing for it. The only way to make it 100 % sure that there aren't any such moderators is to take new ones with a solid track record of being absolutely against it.  What makes me be even more sure about these changes being a push to force the sub out from its original mission is the fact that when these rules are criticised the only responses the users get is more vagueness. I mean just look at these answers:    Assume this is explicitly breaking reasonable rules.    It is our business when you post a link complaining about it. We don't ban for outside activity, nor do we care. You make a link about it, it pertains to us.    Go to a chan if you want shitposting. It's too common right now.    Shitposting will earn you a ban regardless of who you are.     They can't even define shitposting. Fucking joke.   As long as you didn't break any rules, and you weren't a dick to the mods, your story is welcome here.   Still not addressing the issue that rules are in much the source for cancer. Where mods erect rules that are catch-all. To use when they want to kick someone who is annoying, disagrees with their political opinion etc.  One mod who now has deleted his comment after realising that it would look bad had only this reply to my opposition: ""Do you do anything else but complain?"""

Does president Obama count?   https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/19/president-obama-launches-its-us-campaign-end-sexual-assault-campus  This outrageously distorted number is such a popular feminist meme that even our president parroted it.

Didn't notice I typo'd that until after I saw the reply.  Anyway the focus here should be on what is being reported as the things reported are the most likely to fall into actual crime category and some obtuse unquantifiable category.  The bottom line is that in reality, the actual number is not 12 X what was reported.  That is the subjective propaganda aspect that is so outrageous.  I could produce a survey that showed that 100% of people are subject to online harassment.  While these figures may be ""true"" in the context of the study designed to demonstrate harassment.  They are not a representation of reality that deserves any credence and only exist to inflate a narrative supporting censorship.  Feminists are not interested in protecting women from actual harm.  They are interested in furthering a political agenda.  Claims of ""rape culture"" are used to scare young women into believing that men are evil and to create a flag of righteousness to rally behind.  Are feminists in the Middle East fighting for women who are truly oppressed?  Fuck no.  They are busy wasting millions of dollars in public funding to prevent ""manspreading"" on the subway."
Oppression,3bpavx,cojoco,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:25:35 2015 UTC,Feminists are not interested in protecting women from actual harm.    I know for a fact that many of them are.
Oppression,3bpavx,ProtoDong,2,Wed Jul 1 08:32:42 2015 UTC,"So inflating rape numbers to the point of absurdity is going to help their cause?  No.  In fact it makes most reasonable people see them as cult of hypocrisy, who blatantly attack all that is male, so far as to where they literally blame everything wrong with the world on men.  How is a group telling young women that they are they are victims and gives them status for the more ""victimized"" they are, in any way empowering?  How is it beneficial to women to skew family law to the point where sane men won't even consider marriage?  How does it help women to make them afraid of men who would never even consider harming them?  If we step back and take a more detached view of the situation, feminism will directly cause the things they claim to be against.    Marriage has declined to record lows in 2015 primarily due to family courts being heavily skewed against men.  Every guy I know who has married friends, knows one or two that have been completely and unjustly eviscerated and forced into financial slavery due to a divorce.  It's gotten so bad that you would have to be utterly desperate or borderline retarded to get married.  It is also no secret that 80% of rapists are raised by single mothers.  Likewise, it isn't much of a leap to hypothesize that a dramatic increase in single motherhood will correlate to a dramatic increase in the number of rapists.  Of course these types of outcomes aren't exactly apparent when feminists are petitioning lawmakers for laws that push men out of the home.  The big picture is never something that radical ideologues consider.  But now that women are unhappier than ever before by every known metric... feminists will just blame us for that too."

I accuse  /u/cojoco of dedicating most of his ""work"" on reddit to creating honeypots and here he admits to it. He didn't create or help create antiSRS as a community for the people who are against SRS, as the name would imply to any reasonable person. He created it as a trap. He could keep a lid on ""gullible"" dissenters while disguising the absence of a community sincerely created for the purpose of dissent. That is some movie villan level treachery. I'm sure he has some perverse view of free speech which justifies him creating sham communities to contain dissent. But that view is exactly that and just that: perverse.

At least the rest of the power hungry asshole mods in our moderation team are sincere in their positions. You can debate them and learn a different opinion. Cojoco, on the other hand, is a snake. The purpose of debate with him is to distract you from more deserving targets of criticism. He will say whatever suits him to preserve his buffer position. He will probably even try to defend that, the need for a buffer. But I said he will say whatever suits him to hold onto that position.  While lying to others to stifle their expression might be the pinnacle of free speech to him, I take it slightly more seriously. That might be because I come from a country that devotes  significant resources to perseve liberty and he comes from a nanny state. Oppressing the speech of others for political gain is a valid strategy for an Aussie. Letting my political opponents spew nonsense is my strategy. Cojoco depends on guile. I depend on persuasion.

Oppression,3baniz,go1dfish,3,Sat Jun 27 11:21:33 2015 UTC,/u/blackstar9000 was one of the most dedicated users this site has ever seen.  /u/cojoco I changed my mind.  Keep the shit green theme at /r/PoliticalModeration to honor his memory.  I think it is the only active sub that still carries his colored theme set.

Oppression,3babdm,go1dfish,4,Sat Jun 27 07:51:12 2015 UTC,/u/bipolarbear0 liked to shit on me for bringing this up in /r/modtalk claiming that I was somehow trying to compare myself to MLK.  You'll be happy to know I've moved on; and I'm quite content to idolize Malcom X instead:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2S3ShBexMs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsWyZ0mLAA&feature=youtu.be&t=98  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEO05mrLdQ&feature=youtu.be&t=126  Why don't you do reddit a solid  http://i.imgur.com/zKiytRh.png

Oppression,3babdm,eberkneezer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:57:58 2015 UTC,"Hey LordVinyl  why don't you go DIE IN A FIRE   This shouldn't have been removed as it clearly has meaning and makes references and we have estalished what admin think about telling people to kill themselves.  However, I don't want to reapprove it as I think it will generate another username mention for the admin. So I will just quote you ."
Oppression,3babdm,eberkneezer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:06:17 2015 UTC,It won't: /u/eberkneezer  https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/3bb1pd/no_cancer_sub_network_mods_of_subs_read_this/cskoc59  But even without ripping my tongue out the admins could individually block me and provide a space safe from dissent in their own inbox.
