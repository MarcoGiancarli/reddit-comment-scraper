EliteOne,3e3yyh,retribution002,8,Wed Jul 22 00:37:02 2015 UTC,I literally just closed the /r/EliteDangerous tab I had open because the negativity was horrible. I understand that the PC guys have been playing a lot longer and waiting on stuff a lot longer. But there are people on there who have sunk 100+ hours into the game and are then complaining that they hate it?   Can I make a plea that we never become like them?  Remember: This game is a work in progress. It may or may not change over time and may not release as a final product.

EliteOne,3e3yyh,tha_dood,4,Tue Jul 21 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"Moment of devil's advocacy: I imagine a significant portion of the PC crowd were early adopters and crowdfunding backers of the game, and have this notion that they somehow get a lion's share of the say in how the game is made. Not being actual developers though, I don't think they understand how a development roadmap works combined with the need to market the game to as many people as possible.   With No Man's Sky coming out for PC and PS4, Frontier snagging and proceeding on the XB1 deal for E:D was the smart move, even if it means delaying some long-promised features.  Besides, this isn't a subscription service - they've already got your money, so being negative doesn't make the game fix itself any faster."

EliteOne,3e2dj6,thebige91,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:29 2015 UTC,How do you check how many tons of cargo space you have? Is it the number of cargo slots you have? I only have 24 slots of cargo on my cobra right now but want to get it higher if possible.
EliteOne,3e2dj6,bigheadzach,2,Tue Jul 21 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"Slots = tons. Your ""Cargo"" tab on the right UI panel gives you a full manifest. That means your ship performs more sluggishly when you're full, as you'd expect."
EliteOne,3e2dj6,thebige91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"That's what I figured, how would I get it up to 40 slots (tons) I've bought cargo racks but the biggest cargo racks I can buy only give 4 extra tons. Like I said I'm only up to like 24-28 tons can't remember exactly. Got the stock 16 tons that came with it. And bought a few extra slots that add 4. But I don't see how I'll be able to get it up to 40 unless they offer bigger cargo upgrades that I'm just not seeing."
EliteOne,3e2dj6,bigheadzach,3,Tue Jul 21 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"If you look carefully at each internal slot (especially if its empty), it will indicate the size-class of the compartment. You can fit any module inside an internal slot that's of the same or lower size-class (you can put a Class 1 thing in a Class 2 slot, but not a Class 2 thing in a Class 1 slot), and the outfitting interface won't even show you modules that won't fit in the slot you're currently configuring.  Cargo containers hold 2t at Class 1, 4t at Class 2, doubling in space for each class you go up.  Therefore, if cargo space is your priority, use your highest-class slots for cargo containers, and the smaller ones for other modules. The smaller modules may not work as well as their larger counterparts, of course (and in some cases, like the Shield Generator, you need a minimum size-class to even function given the overall mass of your ship)."

EliteOne,3e2dj6,retribution002,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"There are specific stations in specific systems that have commodities considered rare in the universe. These become increasingly more valuable the farther you travel, to the point of absurdity.    Players have mapped out routes, by which you can travel from station to station, system to system, and continuously load up on these rares, selling them at predetermined locations on the route.    There are things along the way you must do such as refueling or avoiding interdiction that make it eventful, but at the end of each leg when you sell your goods you make amazing amounts of credits.    Here is the one I'm using, and once you get to it the whole thing takes shape and begins making sense. It's from Navonce to Witchhaul, with available detours and optional stops if desired."

EliteOne,3e2dj6,ImaFrakkinNinja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:33 2015 UTC,details on the sidebar. you need a jump range of 15ly minimum for it to not be too much of a ballache.
EliteOne,3e2dj6,jmacncheeze,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:15 2015 UTC,How do I determine what my actual jump range is? I seem to have an issue determining what it actually is.
EliteOne,3e2dj6,ArmadaZero,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"When you're in outfitting, check the FSD Jump Range row. It tells you what the distance is without cargo, the distance ""laden"" (with all cargo and fuel maxed), and your current one.  You can also see it in the left column of the Galaxy Map when plotting a course, beneath the checkboxen for Economical and Fast routes."
EliteOne,3e2dj6,ArmadaZero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:36 2015 UTC,And the only way to improve that range is to upgrade FSD right? Can a cobra even make a 15ly jump range?
EliteOne,3e2dj6,jmacncheeze,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:00 2015 UTC,Most definitely can. I've made 20ly+ jumps in it. It's all about upping the FSD while keeping your weight down by using lighter parts elsewhere. (They may not be the best rated ones. The weight change going from E-rated parts to D-rated parts is a big difference.)
EliteOne,3e2dj6,mrolfson,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:30 2015 UTC,"This. D ones are the lightest, period. So for modules that aren't that critical for you, change to a D rating."
EliteOne,3e2dj6,donttreadonme14,2,Tue Jul 21 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"Did my first two circles from Zaonce to Witchhaul and back yesterday with my DBE. 40T of fuel, 32T of rares, and an 18ly jump range. Upgraded to a class 4B Powerplant and next on the list is a 4B FSD (and a sweet 27ly jump range). Saw my first twin-star and my first brown dwarf star. Ran into a couple white dwarfs, which still scare the hell outta me when I'm not expecting them.  Then, with the route becoming ""shorter"" I'll be raking in the credits.  Also, I'd highly recommend listening to Lave Radio when you're trading. Keeps me entertained across all the jumps."

EliteOne,3e2kx7,retribution002,3,Tue Jul 21 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Think I want to go the Pirate/Bounty Hunter route   If that's your choice I'll give you some ship advices:  For Pirating you'll want either a combat ship (if you have no problem getting only a few tons before returning) or a multi-function (those have more cargo and are easier to equip (less energy problems, don't rely so heavily on shields etc.))  Bounty hunting is essentially a bit like pirating but it's not illegal and you don't need cargo space. That means you can use combat ships better for bounty hunting than pirating. I recommend Bounty Hunting for starting as you don't have to hide from the cops.  You can count Explorer ships as multi-function so I'll list some possible choices of your next ship:  1) Get a Eagle and do bounty hunting (only 6T cargo with shields)  2) Skip the Eagle and go for the Adder (18T with shields; Essentially a multi-function ship but it doesn't take much damage, awesome starting pirating ship, good heat signature (silent running)) With the Adder you can also do some rare trading runs if you are in the mood.  After that get either:  1) A Cobra MK III. (44T with shields) Multi-Function workhorse, viable up to Vulture / ASP. Enough power+ compartments for shield cell bank + FSD interdictor (24T) Also viable for some trade runs.  2) A Viper (not recommended; 14T with shields). This ship isn't that good for unexperienced players, it has a small power plant and relies heavily on it's shields. It also has poor jump range but it is the fastest ship in the game, so you can get away from everything (police, bounty hunters, some Anaconda)  3) A Diamondback Scout. (20T with shields) It's as agile as an Adder/Sidewinder, has plenty of jump range, a large fuel tank, a large enough Power Plant and 4 utility mounts. That means you can add 2 shield boosters some time later as soon as you have the needed credits.  Final advices: 1) Use chaff to hide from cargo scans (Ship scan detected) 2) Don't kill innocents. Just shoot there cargo hatch until cargo comes out 3) The first million is hard, from then on it's easier."
EliteOne,3e2kx7,retribution002,2,Tue Jul 21 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's some great info. Much appreciated man, hopefully get some free time to do some bounty hunting tonight!"
EliteOne,3e2kx7,retribution002,3,Tue Jul 21 20:34:43 2015 UTC,Bounty hunting and pirating are two different things and you will need different ship specs for each.   I would start with a few courier missions to get your piloting skills up a bit (if your like me...i was shiiiit). Once your ready and eagle is a good bounty hunting vessel. Simply drop into a resource extraction site (you probably want to start at low intensity) or a nav beacon. When a target comes up wanted start shooting. Theres alot more tips but im on my phone at the moment. I will try to get back here tomorrow to post some real info if someone else hasnt already done it (currently midnight here...about to go to bed)
EliteOne,3e2kx7,OatsNHoney01,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"Lol no worries, thanks for the post! I gotta figure out where to find RES and nav beacons."
EliteOne,3e2kx7,OatsNHoney01,3,Tue Jul 21 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"Res spawn in asteroid fields or rings on planets. (Careful with rings, i had one around a dwarf star which i thought was a purple gas giant. Got cooked pretty bad before i made it out. This doesnt happen often though).  NAV beacons you will find on your nav computer (left hand side first tab) and are generally very close to where you jump into a system."
EliteOne,3e2kx7,bigheadzach,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:08 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks
EliteOne,3e2kx7,bigheadzach,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:52 2015 UTC,No worries :)
EliteOne,3e2kx7,ElCulebra81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"For bounty hunting the eagle is where you want to go next. I didn't even wait, first thing I did was buy an eagle."
EliteOne,3e2kx7,tha_dood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:58 2015 UTC,The only thing holding me back is there doesn't seem to be a lot of missions available for newbies that aren't trade missions.
EliteOne,3e2kx7,knivedm,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"No not that many, but if you're going bounty hunting you don't need missions, find Unidentified signal sources, Resource Extraction Sites(around rings), or conflict zones (go low intensity) . kill anything wanted and head back to a station to hand in your bounties through the contacts tab.  I ended up buying a hauler when I felt like trading or smuggling. They're real cheap."
EliteOne,3e2kx7,tha_dood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:59 2015 UTC,Cool. Does turning in bounties have an effect on your reputation? For power play and factions and what not
EliteOne,3e2kx7,tha_dood,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"Killing wanted ships will increase your reputation with whoever put out the bounty, I believe.  Killing ships aligned with a local faction will reduce its influence (and since it's a zero-sum game, you will give each of the other local factions a piece of their loss).  Killing ships pledged to an enemy leader in Powerplay earns you Merit Points (some would say more than is appropriate compared to other tasks)."
EliteOne,3e3raq,bigheadzach,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"TLDR, The Dark Wheel was a secretive subfaction within the Pilots' Federation whose purpose appeared to be the investigation and exploration of supernatural phenomena in the galaxy. The original Elite game came packaged with a novella of the same name which describes a story involving this illuminati-esque organization, and the search for the planet of Raxxla which was said to be the key to unlocking a gateway to other universes.  Spoooooooopy!"

EliteOne,3e4jef,DruggistJames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:31 2015 UTC,I'll invite you in a sec go ahead and add me.
EliteOne,3e4ilu,chowder007,2,Tue Jul 21 22:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's really simple. Take a look at this trade route (or any other trade route):  http://i.imgur.com/8VcqjC9.jpg  Pick a system (bold letters) that's nearest to you, and go to the appropriate station there (2nd line). Pull up the commodities market and buy anything you can that is in yellow text (rather than the standard orange). The number underneath the station (e.g. 14t) tells you about how much tonnage you should be able to purchase of that item (sometimes there are two items), but I've noticed that varies quite a bit since this chart was done up a while back on PC.  Once you've bought it, go to the next stop, buy the rare items there. Only sell when the route tells you to (Zaonce, Witchhaul, etc).  To maximize rare trading, outfit a ship (e.g. a Cobra is a good start) with 50+ Cargo space, enough fuel tanks to go 200ly on a run (~48t), and the best frame shift drive you can afford. That's all there is to it."
EliteOne,3e3yzf,badnewsbeasley,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:58 2015 UTC,Also don't get stuck on trying to complete the harder fighting training missions. Move on to the ones on docking and hyper travel.
EliteOne,3e3yzf,chowder007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to just get good practice in during the first training mission where there isn't any pressure. We were all in your shoes once, just take your time and get a good feel for the controls. Get comfortable with them and make adjustments if you need to."
EliteOne,3e3yzf,Bumblebee__Tuna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing for me was changing from default controls to the other option (not sure what it's named). But that allowed me to get supercruise down and generally feels better. Other than that, good luck!  Ps: an autodocker helps a lot."
EliteOne,3e3yzf,RuroniKen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:31 2015 UTC,Classic and this is what i use.
EliteOne,3e3yzf,retribution002,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:35 2015 UTC,Try turning off yaw to roll in controller settings. Really helped me out. Also when on approach clicking the left thumbstick off is essentially strafing and fine tuning. Helps espeically at landing. Whereas regular flight controls are more apt for open space. Just what what worked for me.
EliteOne,3e36ou,spence_mgence88,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"You can definitely do it all in a cobra. If you want to bounty hunt, throw some gimballed pulse lasers on and/or gimballed multi canon. Gimballed will aim at your target for you so very helpful."
EliteOne,3e36ou,OatsNHoney01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"Where are the best places to find the pulse lasers and MC's?  The MC's I'm finding are all pretty low damage.  Also, beam or pulse?"
EliteOne,3e36ou,moxin84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:59 2015 UTC,I prefer pulse due to lower power draw and you can fire them longer before you need to recharge.  As for multi cannon they are all relatively low damage gimballed but it fires alot so it evens out. If you want more damage try regular cannons gimballed but to really get the most out of them you need to be close to your target.
EliteOne,3e36ou,OatsNHoney01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"Sweet, tons of great info. I have a pulse and beam laser but I'm trying to find something other than beam. Anything you recommend on the utility hardpoints? I think I have a Kill Warrant Scanner and a Heat Sink Launcher right now."
EliteOne,3e36ou,OatsNHoney01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:57 2015 UTC,I cant remember what goes in which spot but when i get home from work ill update you on what im currently using.
EliteOne,3e36ou,jmacncheeze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"My Cobra had 2x Multi-Cannon (gimballed) for medium hardpoints and 2x Cannon (gimballed) for small hardpoints. I wrecked on all kinds of ships, from Eagles to Diamondbacks to even a Python (once and it was a harmless NPC). Only issue you'll have is it will take longer to get the shields down with now laser weapons (however the cannon still did work) but once you do you'll rip their hull to shreds."
EliteOne,3e36ou,moxin84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"I've got some sweet beam lasers on my Cobra...I forget what hey are but they cost about 1.2 mil each.  My small hardpoints have 506k cred cannons.  Yes, it takes some maneuvering to make sure those cannon shits hit, but they do some sweet damage!    If I could find some decent MC's instead of cannons, I think I'd go there."
EliteOne,3e36ou,jmacncheeze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:01 2015 UTC,My Multi-cannons were the Class 2F cannons. Super cheap from almost any station.
EliteOne,3e36ou,Captain_Kahn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"What do you think of turreted? I bought an Asp but the four lower hardpoints are kind of in a blind spot so I was thinking of doing four small turreted weapons, 2 pulse, and 2 multi cannons. That way I could put Missle Racks on my medium points."
EliteOne,3e36ou,OatsNHoney01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with them but i believe they increase power consumption however you can lock them in different orientations, as forward firing turreted(like gimballed), fixed and fully turreted, I believe. Hopefully someone comes and confirms."
EliteOne,3e36ou,Quidditch3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:19 2015 UTC,Absolutely. The Cobra is an awesome multi purpose ship was my first smuggler. Kind of fitting considering she is the size of the millennium falcon
EliteOne,3e36ou,knivedm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:16 2015 UTC,"It might be a bit of a challenge trying to spec for all types at once. If you know you are going out for exploration, you'll want a Detailed Surface Scanner and at least a Basic Discovery Scanner (although an Advanced Discovery Scanner is better in the long run.) You'll need a fuel scoop, and a Class A FSD."
EliteOne,3e36ou,kan3abl3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. Yeah it can be all of those things just not at the same time. You'll need to switch up your loadout depending on what you would like to do. The good thing is that modules don't depreciate, so you get the same money back that you spent on them."
EliteOne,3e36ou,knivedm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"Okay good to know. If I want to do less exploring (right now I have just a BDS and it's fun to scan planets and such when I find unexplored ones and I'm okay with that) how should I equip? Right now I've got multi cannons, pulse and beam lasers, a Heat Sink Launcher, and a Kill Warrant Scanner.   I don't know the mechanics of the game very well so I don't know what is relevant to what on my ship but I do have a decent amount of cargo space, what seems like a decent fuel tank, shields, and a BDS. I do have one open spot where a refinery was so I can put something there. I've got smuggling down (or at least I think I do) but I'm not keen on what's necessary for bounty hunting."
EliteOne,3e4bm4,hyoostin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:16 2015 UTC,I'm not 100% on this but I think you need to find the canisters in Rasalhague and pick them up using your cargo scoop. Fly around in supercruise and drop into Weak and Unknown Signal Sources to see if you find it that way.
