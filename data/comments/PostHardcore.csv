PostHardcore,3e3dcd,emjayar08,4,Tue Jul 21 19:14:08 2015 UTC,think anthony and saosin are recording a new album and will then tour.  No more cove.

PostHardcore,3e3zy9,OfmiceandGuillo,4,Tue Jul 21 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"Cove is probably saving children in Africa. He is not only the best vocalist in PH of all time, but also a saint and a scholar. In his free time he enjoys trying to end world hunger as well as going in the ghetto and showing young boys and girls the secret to majestic dreads. Cove hopefully will one day grace upon us new music, once he thinks that everyone is the world's eardrums are strong enough to handle his voice, as well as detect notes that humans never knew existed. Until then we must wait patiently for our savior Cove Reber. Relievers unite!"
PostHardcore,3e3zy9,theharvestwombs,3,Tue Jul 21 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like you are a fellow Cove Reber Believer (Reliever as I like to call us!). But to answer your question, sometimes geniuses need a little time off. Do you think that Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa and then got straight to work on another masterpiece. The answer is no; he took some time off to pursue other interests before once again astounding the world with his drawing of the naked man with two arms and two legs (you know the one).   Genius is much like the Smash Ball from Super Smash Bros Brawl. You beat the ball like it owes you money until it bursts and fills your body with immense power and pleasure. After you use your special power up move, however, that power and pleasure no longer resides within you. For Saosin, Cove received that power up before releasing the S/T and again when releasing In Search of Solid Ground. Saosin may be the greatest post hardcore band ever (At least Cove era Saosin), but one bad release could send the band spiraling into oblivion. Cove is waiting until the Smash Ball once again appears in his life before returning to the music industry.   Make no mistake, though, his return will be great. I will end this comment with one more analogy. When Jesus died, there was a three day period before he rose again from the dead. In terms of Cove Reber, this is the period we are in now. He released some stellar tracks, then went away much like Jesus did when he died. But, much like Jesus, Cove Reber will rise again and show the world that there is still hope. Cove Reber's voice will once again ride the radio waves. Cove Reber, truly, is the GOAT. Relievers Unite!  EDIT:  Added more Cover Reber fanboyism."

PostHardcore,3dzany,mking22,2,Tue Jul 21 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that Acceptance Speech is far and beyond their worst album. There's something weird about Tilian's voice throughout the album, and the screaming portions of songs don't blend well with the clean vocal portions. I thought I just didn't like Tilian's voice, but I realized, upon listening to Instant Gratification, that it wasn't his voice, and that it was something they did on that album."
PostHardcore,3dzany,Vensuad,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:42 2015 UTC,Maybe the shit production on it. The bass isn't even audible and there's a weird techno vibe to a lot of it (sometimes purposefully and satirically but still).

I am not saying he didn't do it, or that he did, because I have no idea what happened, none of us do.   Some people has resulted to calling him a rapist, which there are no evidence of, but to many that is warranted simply because they do not like him. To me that is extremely problematic, and kind of frustrating because I don't think that is a word anyone should just ever throw around.

PostHardcore,3dzs5m,RatRebellion,2,Mon Jul 20 23:45:10 2015 UTC,Are you saying he shouldn't have addressed it then or have been vague about it?

PostHardcore,3dzs5m,moshlyfe,-4,Mon Jul 20 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"No, but it seems a little more fishy to say he was innocent of rape when that wasn't even the allegation levied against him by the tour."

PostHardcore,3dzs5m,moshlyfe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:19 2015 UTC,sigh Apparently not.
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,JSBUCK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:42:20 2015 UTC,The music news is guilty of it too.. all of a sudden today the articles I'm seeing are accusing Jonny of sewage dumping.  If it was that easy rumors wouldn't be dropping out of thin air haha
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,moshlyfe,3,Tue Jul 21 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Jonny got drunk, made a girl uncomfortable in a way that absolutely qualifies as sexual harassment, and is somehow not a bad person, nor relapsing, nor worthy of being tarnished.  Let's face it, if anyone else on this got drunk and sexually harassed someone, they'd be kicked off too. It's not a witch hunt against Jonny. It just so happens that Jonny is a compulsive liar and has earned a reputation for being untrustworthy. Of course his bandmates are going to stand by him."
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,Runeon12,5,Mon Jul 20 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"Let's face it, if anyone else on this got drunk and sexually harassed someone, they'd be kicked off too.   Are you serious? How are you so naive to believe these kind of incidents don't happen on a DAILY basis in the music industry? Men are pigs, I'm sure /u/moshlyfe is the utmost gentleman that would never harm m'lady, but the average man when drunk will say/do stupid shit.  I'm not saying what Jonny did was right or ""okay"" it was without a doubt inappropriate, but did it warrant them getting kick off the tour? I am certain that if this was anyone else on the tour their band would not have been kicked off. Hell, if it was some nobody from some small band it probably would never be brought to anyone's attention.   I'm not arguing the point that Jonny offended the girl and crossed a line with her. If she was made uncomfortable that's her right, and an apology should have been all that was necessary in the situation. Or if she was really that offended by his drunken dry humping she could have pressed charges, but I doubt she'd see the light of day in any court.  If you honestly think they deserved to be kicked off the tour for this incident you are a total fucking prick."
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,longhair_dude,0,Tue Jul 21 05:45:40 2015 UTC,"Women have different levels of comfort, especially around men they work with. For some women, the way Jonny behaved would have been totally fine. For others, it's uncomfortable and invasive. Sexual harassment is still a crime. I'm not saying they should do jail time or anything, but for Jonny to be a recovering drug addict and make a mistake like this kinda shows that he's not ready to be on tour again. How many chances does he get, and where's the line for him to make mistakes? Is he just allowed to get away with things like this solely on the basis that he was drunk? I get mistakes are made. I get he's only human. But he's clearly not helping himself by getting wrapped up in shit like this. If anything, they deserve to be off the tour so Jonny can meet with whomever it is that's supervising his recovery, if such a person even exists."
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,Runeon12,-13,Tue Jul 21 13:52:13 2015 UTC,There was no sexual harassment and he's allowed to drink. The girl went on tour with five guys and she thought they wouldn't act out a little bit? Don't be naive
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,moshlyfe,12,Mon Jul 20 22:53:46 2015 UTC,The girl went on tour with five guys and she thought they wouldn't act out a little bit?   Is she not allowed to take a job as a merch girl then? That's the stupidest thing I've ever read.
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,CORPORATECATS,8,Mon Jul 20 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"Just image that logic in the office, a lady working with 5 guys should expect to be harassed. Gross."

She can also call the guys out if they do something she doesn't like.  Does she need to get the band kicked off for it? No, Jonnys not a rapist the band never assaulted her sexually it was bad behavior that probably should've been discussed with the band and Kevin Lyman not a ""town hall"" of people who are biased to Jonny Craig.  Their old merch girl was able to call them out on their bullshit but still expected to be treated like one of the guys"
PostHardcore,3dzs5m,seventhousandmiles,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think her intention was to get the band kicked off the tour, to be frank I don't think any one of us knows her intentions. However, what we do know is that she didn't like what Jonny did to her and reported him to a higher up like anyone else in her position is supposed to."
PostHardcore,3dyggr,KayongoMutumba,10,Mon Jul 20 15:44:19 2015 UTC,I always feel like I'm the only one that is always disappointed in. Slaves by how boring Johnny is. He does have a very nice voice but he ALWAYS holds his notes too long and does weird stuff. I think that he would benefit from another singer in the band. Not that I think he would do well sharing the spotlight. It's like watching/listening to a post-hardcore Whitney Houston or mariah Carey
PostHardcore,3dyggr,Awww_Yee,11,Mon Jul 20 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"You know, I keep trying to give the first Slaves album a proper listen, but all the songs just sound the same. Similar song structure, similar riffs, and no variation in the vocals on a song to song basis. It's just 11 or 12 versions of the exact same song. I like the sound, but damn I'm disappointed."

PostHardcore,3dyggr,Trainnnnn,8,Mon Jul 20 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"In February 2011, several of Craig's fans accused him of being involved in an internet scam. According to the alleged victims, Craig would claim to be selling a used MacBook through his Twitter account. After accepting an online payment on average between US$600 and $800 for the product from at least 16 individuals, Craig was reported to have discontinued communication with the buyers, and no MacBooks were ever distributed. He initially denied the accusations and claimed that his Twitter had been hacked and he had no involvement.[43] However, the following week it was announced that Craig had dropped off his current tour in Emarosa with Chiodos to enter detox in order to treat his ongoing battles with heroin addiction. Rise Records and the Artery Foundation assumed financial responsibility for the internet scam and intend to reimburse anyone who had been victimized. Tilian Pearson, formerly of Tides of Man, substituted for Craig during his absence from Emarosa.[44] A public apology was issued after his detox treatment was completed on March 8, 2011.[45]  From Wikipedia.  I've heard other stories of him being a complete asshole to fan's/people but maybe a lot of it is when he wasn't clean livin."

PostHardcore,3dyggr,teamwrk,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"It goes back further than that. He always had that ""rockstar"" attitude, treating other people like hey were guests in his reality show. He burned all his bridges in his hometown, got kicked out of his original band Ghost Runner on Third, and moved to Sacramento because he had nowhere else to go. That's when he met the guys that would form Dance Gavin Dance."
PostHardcore,3dyggr,Statue_left,5,Mon Jul 20 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"He scammed money out of his fans. He injured someone (I think it was suicide silence's bassist?) on all stars tour. His drinking has ruined many live performances, his drug use has heavily affected those around him. He joined DGD again, which led to kurt leaving/being removed, and then barely showed up on the album. He's managed to make Craig Owens, someone who is notoriously kind of a douche, refuse to do more Isles and Glaciers with him involved. Now it's coming out that his drinking and possible sexual harassment have gotten his new shitty band kicked off Warped. He has literally zero redeemable qualities in his public life aside from his voice. He's a grade A douche bag. Even in his fucking songs he sounds like an asshole."

Half of it is the boring instrumentals and the other half is him changing something with his voice. He doesn't sing as high anymore so it just sounds like the same thing over and over and over.

There were NOT drugs involved nor was anyone in our band looking to buy, or sell drugs.  There was NO RAPE or any forceful sexual harassment, no woman was ever touched or even spoken to, just felt uncomfortable by our behavior.  We NEVER agreed to Warped Tour, Or to Colleen that we would not drink on this tour.  We did NOT empty our non existent sewage tank from our bus all over  Let me make it %100 clear that we are not continuing Warped Tour because we were voted off because the opinions of certain people who believe that since Jonny drank, despite his success getting clean, will lead to his relapse.  This band has been under a microscope for everything we have done, we have had to bite our tongue for every completely twisted story that hits the internet, and are now being called rapists for something the internet doesn’t know about, all of this is because of what people have read about Jonny’s past instead of what people KNOW about who Jonny is.  We aren’t the people you have read about, if you would take the chance to get to know us you would see that every situation isn’t what you read of it online.  Our first merch person was a very attractive girl whom remains to be our very good friend. You can read her statement here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn3q90  We stood by jonnys side the last year, we stood by his side last night and we will stand by his side this morning. because we KNOW the truth.  This is all we are going to say about this situation.  cheers.

PostHardcore,3du15b,andreasmiles23,19,Sun Jul 19 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Not trying to start a fight but a lot of people in recovery would say that him drinking is already a relapse. The statistic is that returning to a secondary substance (though he was kicked out of DGD after DBM 1 for drinking so maybe not secondary) can result in a likelihood of primary substance relapse of 3-8 times that of the person who does not.   Speaking about people in my own life, former heroin users can be some of the heaviest drinkers that I know."

PostHardcore,3du15b,mouthEXPLOS1ON,15,Sun Jul 19 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"You don't just ""get sober"" on one substance and then be a heavy drinker and everything is all fine and dandy. Johnny Craig is a substance abuser, and it doesn't really matter what substance it is. It's self destructive behavior and it's going to persist until he's 100% sober and no longer getting fucked up on anything, and I feel so bad for him nobody close to him seems to understand this. And yes, it may be an unpopular opinion but as long as he's getting fucked up you can absolutely judge him on his past. His problems are not over, and he wasn't voted off of Warped Tour by an angry mob of people that don't know him. He was voted off by the people that have seen him every day this summer. His peers know all of this and that is why he was voted off, not because he made one rude comment. There are bigger issues here than what he said to some girl."

I'm sick of all these opinions and comments from people that do not understand addiction or recovery at all, yet they still feel the urge to type out a bunch of bullshit like they know what they are talking about. Let me give you all some facts from someone who has far too many experience points in addiction and recovery. A little background on myself; I am 30 years old, started drinking and smoking pot around 14, graduated to LSD, benzodiazepines and cocaine in my late teens, and started doing OxyContin in my mid-20s. I quickly became addicted and started banging them along with dilaudid and heroin. I've been a heavy opiate addict for around seven years now so I have the right and experience to tell y'all what's up. Drinking IS A RELAPSE. Smoking pot IS A RELAPSE. My first time I went through recovery I thought I could smoke pot still which quickly led back to heroin. My second time in recovery I made it six amazing months. I was happier and healthier than I had ever been and thought I was strong enough to occasionally have some drinks with friends. Can you guess what happened? That's right! It led back to heroin. I'm now begging for a third chance at recovery and know that the only way to stay clean is to stay clean from everything. If Johnny is serious about his recovery (which he obviously isn't) then he wouldn't be drinking. If drinking hasn't led to him booting dope again yet, which i can almost guarantee it already has, it ultimately will. Opiate addicts brains are wired different than the average drinker/smoker. A couple drinks or a couple bowls will never be enough because we know how high we really can get, and that's the only high that satisfies our sick minds. When Johnny actually wants to change his life and be seen in a different light then he needs to do what he already knows what needs to be done, which is to stay clean of ALL mind altering substances."

PostHardcore,3du15b,JimmyMcShiv,3,Mon Jul 20 14:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of people here commenting saying ""he never quit drinking but he's still sober"" are fucking brain dead and its people like that that surround Johnny Craig and make him think he's doing the right thing. Anyone who thinks a recovering heroin addict can have alcohol AT ALL can promptly go fuck themselves. (and yes, some former addicts can drink and not relapse. Please people, learn the difference between exception and rule).  That being said, you sound like you're in the right mind state and I really hope you stick to it this time. Third times the charm! Good luck dude!"
PostHardcore,3du15b,mouthEXPLOS1ON,2,Mon Jul 20 02:06:56 2015 UTC,"Just to add a little nuance...  I am still in the camp that he isn't clean, but it is worth noting that drugs have around a 10% capture rate. Generally speaking, most people won't develop an addiction and there are large numbers of people who can use a secondary substance without experiencing other similar issues.   That said, it isn't worth the risk in my opinion. If there is a 30% chance that drinking would mean full relapse, it is too high and any treatment program will tell you the same thing. Having that knowledge and still doing it is a lot like getting in a car and having a 30% chance of getting in a fatal accident. I'd stop getting in cars."
PostHardcore,3du15b,JimmyMcShiv,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"With heroin being his main addiction, it is much much more than 30%."

My thing is though that, while it does suck for him, it isn't crazy to understand why people can't just assume he isn't in the wrong. He has ripped off tons of people and in the grand scheme of things, hasn't done a whole lot to reverse that. Sure he isn't doing heroin, but his behaviors due still seem to be causing problems."

PostHardcore,3du15b,JimmyMcShiv,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"We actually have no idea if he was drunk during the incident. We know that A) Warped got mad Slaves had alcohol and B) it can be reasonably assumed that Jonny made a stupid comment to a female worker. Now it can be assumed that A leads to B. However correlation does not equal causation here. For all I know, a manager at Warped approached the band about the alcohol in their possession, and Jonny retaliated with a rude/objectifying response. Now, he obviously shouldn't have said anything on those lines. But we have zero idea if he was under the influence. People are assuming he was because of his past as a drinker/drug addict."

If Jonny Craig still has a drinking problem then A. his old antics will probably continue into the future (Which is why every other band on Warped voted them off of the tour) and B. abusing one substance dramatically increases the likelihood of relapsing with other substances.  I don't know why Slaves was even booked for this tour. JC has been an issue almost every single year one of his bands has played Warped.

Staying sober means being sober, Jonny wasn't sober, it was only a matter of time before he would've relapsed and gone back into his old ways.  Them bringing up the merch girl is a moot point, it could've been an ugly girl it has nothing to do with the girl who felt uncomfortable with their actions, she's still a human being and it just seems that they're writing her off completely.  Fuck Slaves, and Fuck Jonny Craig, I feel like a lot of you can agree that this dude has been given WAY too many chances, and continues to disrespect people in a way that shows he literally does not care. It's a shame that someone with such a beautiful fucking voice is literally falling off the deep end right before our eyes.

As in, there's lots of 15 year olds who think actually trying to punch someone in the pit is acceptable and support bands have typically gotten bad responses from the crowd. One night in particular that was bad was the 2nd night in the Roundhouse, Camden when Cancer Bats were supporting. I left that gig early just from how pissed off I was getting with the crowd."

I, being used to the younger crowds at hardcore shows and warped tours, was happy to see that most people at this particular ES show were all in their 20's for the most part. However, there was still one or two assholes who were completely drunk and just being belligerent and obnoxious the whole show, but no annoying moshers or youngsters raising trouble. But this was just one experience and in no way can I say that it was a normal ES experience and have the evidence to back up the claim."

PostHardcore,3dpx63,ktm57ktm57,0,Sun Jul 19 22:36:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, Jon said in this interview that he wrote all of the lyrics for DBM 2  http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dance-gavin-dance-jon-mess-interview   When I came back, I went on the last tour with Kurt and we were going to break up the band if we didn’t get Jonny back to try out the Downtown Battle Mountain II thing. We didn’t know at the time his drug situation, so during recording I made all the lyrics probably the most out there of anything I’d done, and reflect the situation being with him. That period was like, “Guys, I’m not sure what’s going on. This seems hopeless.”"

PostHardcore,3dpx63,BigWiggly1,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:49:58 2015 UTC,Jon is most likely referring to his own lyrics there.

Same goes for bands like Your Demise, We are the ocean and Lower than Altantis. Big UK bands that could headline warped tour UK kinda size, but barely scratched the U.S. Market.  Architects were a prime example, they broke into America on their 2013 warped tour appearance, successful earlier tour with enter shikari that year and it helped promote them, and then sign with epitaph. (They were considering giving up on the U.S. scene before their shikari tour) Lost prophet signed with fearless records before going on warped to promote their newest album and as a result get more exposure."

Jonny might be able to sing well at times but his behavior has been the downfall of DGD more times than it has been the spotlight. If I remember correctly, he was kicked out almost right after they went on for for DBM1 and again for DBM2.   I get that you want his signature but he, just like Ronnie Radke hurt this scene and distort the views of impressionable young girls in the scene (a thing that is growing all the time).  Sexual harassment isn't okay and I think it's ridiculous to hope that he doesn't get shown that it isn't okay."

PostHardcore,3doud6,sirjohnbonham,4,Sat Jul 18 02:02:53 2015 UTC,Detroit has a fantastic scene. So many good bands out of the surrounding areas and Michigan in general. I live in Cleveland and I absolutely love the scene here but I do find myself making the drive up to Detroit quite often
PostHardcore,3doud6,shmate4L,2,Sat Jul 18 04:39:25 2015 UTC,"Man, I remember how vibrant the scene was around here back when bands like The Chiodos Bros were comin' up(noticed your flair). There were all kinds of great local bands no matter what genre you were into, Bear Vs Shark, Fordirelifesake, The Black Dahlia Murder, The Suicide Machines, The Weakend, and later on La Dispute. It seems it's died down since the early/mid 2000's, but there's always great local talent that comes and goes.   Somebody actually wrote a book about that early 2000's scene that I was into in Metro Detroit because it was huge and it embodied the DIY ethos. Playing shows at Knights of Columbus halls that bands would rent out or inside kids living rooms. You can check out some of it here or buy it here"
PostHardcore,3doud6,thegodawfultruth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that's so cool. Yea that was a great time for our scene, some incredible bands you listed there.

I was actually just up there at the Crofoot for I The Mighty haha. I have to say, that's probably one of my favorite venues. I just love the setup there and the feel of everything."

And I only listed bigger name bands that came out of this area, but the best shows were the smaller local bands during that time. If you're really curious I can shed some more light on that time.  One band in particular called Forever Ending had a show at least once a month and everyone would pass flyers out and talk about the next upcoming show all month. Forever Ending only released one split CD. They broke up and some of the members formed The Weakend who actually achieved some national recognition. But I think this video shows exactly what I mean by that vibe that could only be achieved by local bands and their strong following of fans. This was at the release show for their split CD and all the kids already knew all the words to their songs. Wish I could go back to being young like that and reliving all the fun that the music scene had to offer. This was pre-youtube and pre-camera-phone so only a handful of videos exist of these guys but this shit will be the nostalgic soundtrack to any metro-detroit scene kid's youth. Hoping that kids nowadays find their music scene and live it up because there is always a tremendous amount of talent cooking up great music throughout metro-Detroit."

They have such a cool sound. Ours has a growing indie/post hardcore scene. Kind of like new Tides Of Man since they lost their vocalist. But it's got a bit more grit. It's pretty similar to new Pianos Become The Teeth a bit. These guys will spit out material with average production and everyone digs it."

There is so much going on in the scene! Here are some links for you :) Hopefully this will help you get into the scene.  Bands:  nanashi  With Iowa In Between  Infinite Me  Victor Shores  Remo Drive  Wanderer  City of the Weak  Household  Groups:  Twin Cities Hardcore  Minnesota Punk  Join these groups and follow bands, we all play shows with one another all the time, so going out to even one show you can leave with a bunch of new bands to listen to. Also most of the people in the scene are super nice and will chat about bands all day if you want.  For real, this list is super off the top of my head, but let me know if you want to talk more.   Shameless self plug! Our next show is with Wanderer, Infinite Me, and La Luna before all of us leave on tour. August 12th at Hymie's Records. Come check it out and say hello!  Hope this helps, Kyle"

PostHardcore,3doud6,Shadow_Burger,2,Sun Jul 19 05:56:47 2015 UTC,There are actually many dhows were I live. It overlaps with metal-core and melodic-hardcore. However over here in Germany post hardcore often gets confused for emo since that's what the emo kids in 2009-2011 used to listen to.
PostHardcore,3doud6,Thatkidyouknow420,2,Sat Jul 18 09:19:48 2015 UTC,"Melbourne, Australia reporting in. Yes but it is divided like straight down the middle at the moment. The lighter side has got super fucking lame at the moment aside from a couple of bands. Every one is just playing the same shit now. 5-7 years ago it was fantastic, hearing a new sound with every band. Now every one is either trying to be Emarosa, Pierce the Veil or the next Djent hero's.  The more old school / punk side of the scene is hitting next level here though. Really cool stuff coming out that I've never really heard anything like before. Would be surprised if at least 3 or 4 of these bands don't break out.  High Tension, Batpiss"

PostHardcore,3dpl9h,stunnedpanda,2,Sat Jul 18 13:02:30 2015 UTC,"That was fun, thank you! Midnight Matinee reminded me a lot of Emarosa, he had a tendency to shy away from the high notes in favor of falsettos though.  Colours reminded of Poison the Well, specifically the song Apathy is a Cold Body, although this song was kinda mellow.  Far From You, well.. this song was kinda cute  Embracer had some touching lyrics, and I loved his yelling near the middle of the song  Ella Sera, the energy had my bouncing around here at work with my phone up to my ear, I'll be coming back to this one later.  Oh, Clemency was great too, I love the top-of-your-lungs style singing.  Proceed was kinda meh, maybe I'm starting to get burnt out, maybe I'm still reeling from quality of the last two bands, I'll come back later.  Living Like Ghosts, there's something about this song that makes me feel good and pay attention, I'm intrigued  Donella Drive, I wonder if this is what Mars Volta would sound like if they were sober and uninspired   Atlas Uncharted, fucking christ, didn't expect this after listening to the others, no whisper screams here, definitely appeals to my harder side, I had to resist the urge to listen to more so I could finish the list.  Violet, I have mixed feelings about this, with the previous song the juxtaposition was kind of surprising and with that it was refreshing, with this song I feel that either vocalist would do great on their own, I love them both just not together. I really really like the clean vocals and wonder if there are any acoustic songs so I can hear him better.   In Oceans, wow these guys are all over, very unstructured and hyper, there could be something here if they got a different drummer and the guitarist took a xanax.. or ritalin  Oceans, this song started out another oddly intriguing feel good rock song, and then as my interest was waning they threw in a bridge and guitar solo, kinda reminiscent of newer Killswitch... aaaand then back to the hook.. again. However..  Don Vedda is awesome. I'll be listening more to this also.   I don't think my s.o. will be too into a lot of this but I certainly found some good new music, thanks introducing me to all of it! :)"

PostHardcore,3do8tw,hxc_Everycore_hxc,6,Fri Jul 17 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"It's a lot more complex than having a nice camera. Most shows are going to be dark, but the subjects are going to be moving, which makes it pretty difficult. You're going to need a camera with pretty good low light capabilities (high ISO without a lot of grain) and a fast lens. You're also going to need Lightroom or some other professional editing software for post production. I would highly recommend working with your camera for a while and shooting a bunch of different things before diving into concert photography. It's really important to understand the triangle between shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Unless you have a really high quality camera and a super fast lens, you're going to have to learn to manipulate those three things, along with planning for post production, to get the shot you want. For example, I can bump my ISO suuuuuper high in order to capture a moving guitar player, but the photo will come out very grainy and unappealing. Or I can slow my shutter speed to allow more light in, but the image will probably be blurry. Finding a balance and understanding of these things before going to a concert will help a lot."

I know one of the guys who worked on that album worked on Lana Del Rey's first release, but it's a different producer. I'm pumped because that means the production is going to be out of this world good.  Also, Kenji told me his style is a mixture of 70's soul (think Michael Jackson) and 80's metal (not crushing guitar solos, but big, iconic chords) and he will be adding those elements to the album.

PostHardcore,3dn58a,mrstuprigge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:08:07 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive it was England as I remember hearing them and seeing their dates were consistently small English clubs for like 3 years straight. Their sound was like a cross between thrice and moving mountains. The song I have of theirs that is stuck in my head has a melodic line of like a vibraphone. I also want to say one of their album covers has a red balloon on it but that may not be correct.

PostHardcore,3df08p,JohnFoxpoint,2,Wed Jul 15 21:07:11 2015 UTC,Saw them open for secret lives of the freemasons when they were still called Harvard. They were perfect live. I regret not seeing them more.
PostHardcore,3df08p,Destructo-Spin,9,Thu Jul 16 13:45:59 2015 UTC,Rumor has it they broke up.
PostHardcore,3df08p,RufinTheFury,5,Wed Jul 15 20:32:38 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed their stuff. Their live show was amazingly weird and entertaining as well.
PostHardcore,3df08p,bloodxandxrank,5,Thu Jul 16 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"I saw them nine times I believe, over the course of several years. I was lucky enough to see them collectively play every song off of the two LPs between those shows, and I even got to see Jesse play as his side project, The Bear Romantic (check it out if you haven't already). After finding Harvard, I never missed an opportunity to see them when they came to Maryland or DC.  They were always the coolest guys and their live shows were so beautifully haunting. To this day Jesse's stage presence is unparalleled in my mind by almost any other band or performer I've seen. I will always remember his flailing hands pointed at the crowd in songs like ""French Girls;"" the weird masks he would come out in; the creepy trucker voice with which he would tell seemingly fabricated stories to the crowd in between songs; how he once told a very attractive friend of mine that he wanted to ""put her teeth in a jar and sleep with them over his bed.""  Guys... Jesse, Lee, Jason, Garrett, and Tim... I don't know if you'll ever read this, but your fans miss you. I hope you all decide to play again someday. Until that day comes, however, I will continue to spread the good word that is Harvard/Hrvrd/HRVRD."
PostHardcore,3df08p,jam_pudding,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"I've reached out to them over social media a few times, and received no answers. This band was the reason I began playing in a post hardcore scene, and they've influenced my playing so much. I don't want to say they broke up, but from everything circulating on the web, it seems like they've called it quits. Jesse, Lee, and Garrett the newer drummer they had towards the end of their days have been doing a new project that Jesse posts a lot about on instagram, I don't think their other guitarist Jason is very active on any social networks, and the bass player Garrett moved to Singapore to teach. This is as much info as I've been able to gather. Hope they're just on a hiatus till the bass player comes back. I'm dying to hear new stuff. A new song by the name of howl was all the new I got from them. Come back hrvrd!"

PostHardcore,3de5b2,ja524309,2,Wed Jul 15 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"I definitely hear a bit of circa. Very briefly in small parts. Just my two cents. Remember, music is so subjective, people do truly experience it differently."

Sure it may be their opinion, but that doesn't mean it isn't right.   /u/ja524309 is right there are hardly any similarities between this song and Circa. Both bands have singers with a high pitched voice, but so do a lot of other bands not even in this genre. There's no need to dismiss what someone's saying just because they are speaking their opinion that is different than yours."

PostHardcore,3dd2s7,moshlyfe,4,Wed Jul 15 15:48:36 2015 UTC,Last thing I remember hearing was Jason joined back up (I think it was him at least). But that was way back at the end of 2014/beginning of 2015. Nothing since though. Craig's doing solo shit and he seems to really be focusing on that as of late. Although he's obviously still doing stuff with Bradley as he was on Craig's one single that got released.   I've been holding out hope for an AWTEW 10 year anniversary tour. It would be an awesome way to come back after all this silence. But at this point I'm just hoping they're not broken up.

PostHardcore,3d6gsz,Highelf04,2,Mon Jul 13 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"Ladcore.  They are a band that have changed a lot over the years. They did a DJ set list a few years back and it was one of the best club nights I've ever been to, they played a good mixture of Pop-punk and Post-Hardcore. You can definitely tell their earlier influences could arguably be post-hardcore.   They've always been a weird band, who give off a real lad-ish vibe but end up being heavier than you would expect.

PostHardcore,3d21a8,daymankarate,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:21 2015 UTC,Yup. Those three are by far the best.
PostHardcore,3d21a8,shipwrecked9,4,Mon Jul 13 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"There are two ways I listen to Silverstein: (1) song by song; (2) taking the album as a whole. A Shipwreck in the Sand is my favorite album, and it has a lot of my favorite songs (A Great Fire, Vices, Broken Stars, American Dream, Born Dead, A Shipwreck in the Sand, I Am the Arsonist). Discovering the Waterfront is one of my least favorite albums, but it has some amazing songs (Your Sword vs. My Dagger, Smile In Your Sleep, Fist Wrapped In Blood, My Heroine, Call It Karma). That is not to say it isn't a great album, but when I think of it as a whole, it's behind their concept albums. I've enjoyed their concept albums more than the rest. To me, I Am Alive In Everything I Touch is their third best album (First: A Shipwreck in the Sand, Second: This Is How The Wind Shifts). It has some great songs on it, and taking it as a whole, the songs fit it perfectly. Maybe looking at individual songs it isn't their best work, but it's hard to take songs from a concept album on their own.    Buried At Sea is classic Silverstein to me, and one of my favorite songs off the album, along with Milestone, A Midwestern State of Emergency, Heaven Hell and Purgatory, The Continual Condition, and Toronto.    Silverstein got me into this genre, and I thoroughly enjoy this album. They've been consistent throughout their career (yes, I know, Arrivals and Departures), and I think they've mostly gotten better with time.    This is my take."

They were ultra friendly about it and were more then happy to send me a copy. I ended up having a conversation with the guitarist via email about future tours to Canada and he really seemed to appreciate his fans.  Things like this go a long way and I will always be a fan of theirs because of it.

Their sound is so introspective and their music insights deep thought for me of life and where I'm headed. I've got so many amazing memories attached to their melodies and different smells that I remember. I would give anything to find a band that sounds exactly like them and still is active.  I have found quite a number of bands with an almost identical sound though, if anyone would like any!"

PostHardcore,3d25sm,xxx_guccimane_xxx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:02:44 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on the smell thing. I know that smell is tied SO greatly to memory, which is why I went to the store and bought many different herbs before listening to this album. I would smell a different herb for every single song, so that I could tie that smell to that specific song. For example, I would smell oregano while listening to Fireflies (Light Messengers), so now when I smell oregano I think of this song. Whenever I go grocery shopping with the fam, I can always catch a faint whiff of cumin or thyme and think of Saosin's amazing melodies. I always think about what the genre would be like if Cove never left Saosin. They could have transcended music as a whole and become true legends of rock. Peace fam."

I wasn't a big fan of Letlive at the time so the sight I saw stuck with me. I remember Jason just going crazy. Jumped onto the bar and started kicking empty cups, would place the mic on the amp and kneel down, bend over and sing into it. My favourite moment was when he flung the mic onto the balcony above the stage, ran up the stairs, grabbed it, started singing, threw it back down, then attempted to climb over the edge of the balcony and jump off, realized it was too high, and ran back down again. It was hilarious to watch, I was so confused. I wish I had looked into them a bit more or else I would've totally loved it."

PostHardcore,3cww7k,highvoltorb,5,Sat Jul 11 14:10:02 2015 UTC,This definitely was not one of my favorites when I heard it on the first listening of the album. Probably since I don't enjoy that original song. But it has since grown on me. :)

PostHardcore,3cwfsl,lifeanddecay,2,Sat Jul 11 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"""This album was written between July and October of 2011. In the 4 or so years since the creation of this album, Idle Satellites went through member changes, botched live performances, arguments, fights and failures, ultimately leading to our disbanding in 2013. This project made me feel like I could accomplish anything, and that my success in the music industry was inevitable; yet it also completely took the wind out of my sails, and left me feeling broken and discouraged for over 2 years. We were 6 people who, together, were able to grasp at something greater than we could have achieved alone, if only for a moment. These demos are all that is left to show for the years of work that we poured into that band. Hopefully, you enjoy it as much as we did. """

So awesome show in general, but they closed with TAAATD. And as Teppei is playing the intro hook to the breakdown, the guitarist from UO runs out and grabs Dustin's guitar and plays his part while Dustin jumps into the audience and crowd surfs while screaming the ending. Fuckn epic, possibly only topped by Davey Havock literally walking upright on the crowds hands, but that's more physically impressive than epic as fuck impressive."

PostHardcore,3ctkfc,pretty_dirty,2,Sat Jul 11 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia: On December 22, 2014, the band posted an image on its website showing the view from behind the mixing desk, facing the band performing, overlaid with the text ""Thrice 2015.""   Two months later, Thrice began announcing their inclusion in several 2015 music festivals, including New Jersey's Skate and Surf Fest in May; Montebello, Quebec's Amnesia Rockfest in June; Folkestone, UK's Hevy Music Festival in August; and three sites for Riot Fest, Denver in August as well as Chicago and Toronto in September."

PostHardcore,3ctkrh,thedeafpoliceman,8,Fri Jul 10 17:50:59 2015 UTC,This has been my problem with Jonny in every band. He has a great voice but there's no variety at all.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,mrstuprigge,3,Fri Jul 10 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I think I'd like anything JC does.  Even if his melodies sound the same, they're melodies I'll always enjoy.    With that said, anybody hearing some crackling in the song? Sounds like some possible production issues.  I hope that's fixed in the final release."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,ImBored_YoureAmorous,4,Sat Jul 11 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"Well it was produced by Cameron Mizell, who IMO is one of the worst big producers in the genre. I'm honestly confused why anyone goes with him any more. At least he didn't totally ruin this album from the sounds of it."

PostHardcore,3ctkrh,escobizzle,13,Fri Jul 10 17:54:08 2015 UTC,dope song title br0  kinda sucks. Jonny's voice doesn't work with boring instrumentals
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,ktm57ktm57,7,Fri Jul 10 18:00:22 2015 UTC,when you have experienced will swans guitar mesh with jonnys vocals pretty much all guitarists are screwed trying to match up.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,8,Fri Jul 10 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but matching up to the likes of Will Swan isn't what needs to happen for him to make good music. He just needs a decent band of musicians behind him. Emarosa and Isles & Glaciers are leagues above Slaves instrumentally."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,charminions,3,Sat Jul 11 00:37:04 2015 UTC,i totally agree. Im not in love with it either. I was politely singling out the guitars.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"Even his two emarosa albums had great instrumental support. Slaves is stil great, but not as good as emarosa with jonny ever was."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,w00tthehuk,7,Mon Jul 20 09:42:45 2015 UTC,I love Johnny and I like Slaves but this song is so fucking boring it sounds like the same 30 seconds were on loop the whole time. I actually forgot what I had playing 3 times while listening to it and browsing. Really hope the rest is better than this.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,coolbad96,7,Fri Jul 10 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people will be quick to hate on this, but it's not bad by any means. Peoples expectations for JC are just so extremely high that any but Relativity or DBM quality will disappoint.   I love the vocal harmonies on this track, and I think Jonny's voice sounds incredible here. I am disappointed in the fake drums once again. This would be so much better if they got a good studio drummer and recorded real drums. Also wish they'd add another talented guitarist because Lyman's style of song writing is getting stale."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,JSBUCK,7,Fri Jul 10 18:14:24 2015 UTC,Agreed on all points. They need more guitar variance and to use real drums.  I think they need to deviate some standard song structure. Jonnys voice is best when telling a story not verse chorus verse chorus.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,2,Fri Jul 10 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"Many verse chorus verse chorus songs tell stories. The Dear Hunter does it all the time.  Edit: that song's verse verse chorus chorus XD but they have lots of other ones that do. In fact, their albums Act I, Act II, Act III, and Act IV all tell the same story and have recurring themes across albums."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,OlanValesco,3,Sat Jul 11 10:39:35 2015 UTC,"Im a huge fan of them, but even they diverge from the standard format. My Point is Slaves tends to follow a format and I think Jonnys best work is when there is no structure and just go with the flow. I wasn't stating songs cant be good but that his best work is done with out it."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,2,Sat Jul 11 10:59:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and I really like this song personally, but it's understandable that people will dislike this and compare him to his old work. The fact is, the band itself is not as talented as DGD nor Emarosa in songwriting/musical talent- not to say they're bad, just not as good... So it's kind of disappointing to hear a top notch voice without a top notch band."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Amazingness905,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I like the song a lot too, but then again I liked Slaves first album. I understand why people are disappointed, I am too for the same reasons, but Slaves is in no form a bad band. People on here are quick to say it sucks when if this was some no name band with some no name vocalist people here would be all over it.  If that makes any sense. After listening to this song a few more times I'm really starting to enjoy it, and if more people weren't so quick to hate then they would probably enjoy it a lot too."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,JSBUCK,4,Sat Jul 11 07:15:16 2015 UTC,He sounds plenty more powerful here.  I'm someone who has Relativity and DBM in his top three records of all times haha but I can appreciate that he's maturing and branching out as a musician.  I think this is gonna be a killer album! The critics will still be at all the Slaves shows anyway
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Toka_Rahzar,5,Fri Jul 10 18:22:45 2015 UTC,Love Jonny Craig but there isn't really anything unique with this single. Will still hold out hope that the album will surprise me.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,coldjeanz,4,Fri Jul 10 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty boring. I'm sure the album will have some good tracks just like the first one did most will probably be like this.   Honestly Jonny makes me laugh. He was surrounded by so much talent in DGD and Emarosa, but threw it all away because he couldn't stop being a head case. He complains that being in a band was limiting him so he goes solo and after about a year of that realizes maybe being in a band wasn't so bad after all and creates Slaves. Only now we just get this boring rehashed stuff   I miss how the old Jonny sounded too, there used to be so much more versatility."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,teasizzle,2,Sat Jul 11 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"I like it, a bit too samey but you're gonna get that from a band like this I guess.   It's also the first time I've found out about a new song thanks to a push notification on Spotify."

PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Dimitri1033,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:47 2015 UTC,"Compared to any track on the last album, this is much better. The song seems more cohesive, and there's actually layering with the vocals."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,JackJuice,2,Fri Jul 10 22:03:33 2015 UTC,"I can dig this. The production touch is definitely a bit heavy, but I think it works well. Sounds like they either improved greatly as songwriters or got some outside help. Jonny sounds controlled here, picks his moments.   You ask me, it's a banger. I loved the first single off LP1, then snoozed through the rest. This has me hopeful for the new thing."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,2,Fri Jul 10 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Solid song but I wish they experimented a lot more and got funky like dgd. This is too purely in the vain of just rock. I don't hear a lot of variance. Everyone got an opinion, I like slaves. I just wish they took more risks and made weirder music."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,coldjeanz,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:23 2015 UTC,You need very talented musicians to do that. Most bands have average musicians that aren't very original so they stick to being safe. I used to be one of those people who thought Jonny would make any band amazing but there is just no getting around boring instrumentals and it's made worse by Jonny not being as good as he used to be.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,caseharts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:48:13 2015 UTC,I agree they arent nearly as good as his previous bands.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Theappleofsauce,2,Sun Jul 12 09:38:05 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty dope. I dug the production way more than their first album, like I can actually tell the guitars/drums apart. Jonny sounds strong. Really looking forward to the rest of the album."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Vomiting_Winter,2,Fri Jul 10 18:24:13 2015 UTC,I guess it's marginally better than the previous album.  I still like Jonny with more DGD-ish stuff.  His voice adds a smoothness and cohesion that really balances out crazy guitar stuff; having smooth/tame guitars (like SLAVES do) tends to make everything mesh too much.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Ley_Line,3,Fri Jul 10 20:16:23 2015 UTC,Im hoping Jonny's next solo record gives us a little DGD throwback

PostHardcore,3ctkrh,thesewordsarefake,4,Fri Jul 10 18:04:48 2015 UTC,In terms of rnb style vocals they do the same for me. They obviously have different styles but are in similar vein. Tyler's a much better songwriter though.
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,shmate4L,2,Fri Jul 10 18:08:08 2015 UTC,"Only heard a few songs from them, but the singer for Issues appears to sing more with his head which makes him sound nasaly where as Johny sings from his chest or what ever which sounds more powerful/soulful."
PostHardcore,3ctkrh,Hendrik4L,2,Fri Jul 10 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"Tyler is definitely more nasally but Jonnys song writing is so lackluster that I can't get into it anymore, that being said I really liked the blueprint for going in circles . He actually played with some new melodies on there. Dude should really work with a new producer who pushes him, not just the regular industry dudes.

Adam's sings well, but he sounds like every other vocalist in scene. Ben had this unique voice which kinda separated you guys from every other band. I hope this isn't the direction you guys are taking because what you guys did with Sleep... was great.  You guys would be better off expanding on that sound. Ricky is a beast as always though!"

PostHardcore,3crkpq,hardiflex_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"As a band we've had an extremely tough run over the past 2 years. With more than half the band leaving (including vocalist Ben Blondel) we've been trying to rebuild In League, and being based in the most isolated capital city on earth, we have fairly limited resources :(. With new members comes new creative inputs and varied writing styles. Pair that with being a few years older, we are a completely different unit. We all agree Sleep was a great achievement for the band however replicating a sound that was quite popular in 2012 we felt wouldn't be relevant to our fans in 2015, and more importantly, to ourselves. As I wasn't in the band when Sleep was released, I'm allowed to say that it's honestly one of my favourite albums and it's nothing short of a pleasure to play live. Hopefully there is something for everyone on the next release :). And from what has been tracked so far, Ricky has only gotten better!!!! - Ben"

It would be cool if you started a subreddit, maybe call it /r/learnasong for this type of thing.  Anyway, good luck dude. It takes a lot of dedication to get good, which most people don't have. My band's first guitarist (playing since he was 7) had a friend who started playing guitar about a year ago and the dude just practiced a lot and within 9 months was learning technical stuff like Never Meant by American Football and Atlas Novus by Scale the Summit. 3 weeks ago he joined the band.   Make sure you learn songs but also theory, it helps me a lot. Learning scales, chord shapes, timing, etc. so you aren't just regurgitating what you hear will do you good."

PostHardcore,3ckd9t,Borpan,2,Thu Jul 9 05:10:51 2015 UTC,I see this complaint a lot on here and while i do agree with the production (screams sound like they're far away from the mic) i enjoy the album way more than Discovering The Waterfront. I think the songs on this album are way more fun.  That being said they've knocked it out of the park with their latest stuff. In my opinion their two latest albums are their best ones.
PostHardcore,3ckd9t,uberhaxorowen,3,Thu Jul 9 08:16:43 2015 UTC,"Its rare to see someone dig this album more then DTWF but I have no ill will against the album and its not by any means bad, just not my favourite! but yeah TIHTWS and IAAIETIT are their best work to date!"

Softened metalcore, POP + Metal, poetrycore, funkycore, classic phc, rock w/ a little bit of screaming...  IDK, sometimes I want to just drag bands out of the genre because they feel out of place. However, the name of the genre itself allows so many variations that I end up accepting the majority of the labeling and life moves on. :P"
PostHardcore,3cmi23,veilsvs,2,Thu Jul 9 02:19:39 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like it's a broad term, but that's something I like about it. Part of what I like about being a fan of ""post-hardcore"" music is that I feel like there's so much variety. There's a lot to discover, and the genre itself is constantly evolving in many different directions. I think that keeps things interesting."
PostHardcore,3cmi23,comicbook_koala,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:42 2015 UTC,"No, because it's cool to be unique but when people start overclassifying bands because they ""dont believe in genres"" it gets stupid as shit"
PostHardcore,3cmi23,moshlyfe,2,Thu Jul 9 06:18:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, I go the opposite direction and prefer to keep my genre classifications in my own music library far simpler, with most things under the umbrella of ""rock"" and whatnot.  The problem with genre classifications is that while they do serve the useful purposes of a) helping people find bands with sounds they like based upon bands they already know and b) helping to simplify discussion of musical style, ultimately every single person's cutoff points and definitions of every single genre and subgenre are totally different.  I try to mostly just not worry about it, personally."
PostHardcore,3cmi23,japr,2,Thu Jul 9 06:45:10 2015 UTC,Yeah it's broad as hell but that's why I consider it an umbrella term these days. There's Post-Hardcore and under Post-Hardcore we have:  First Wave  Second Wave  The Dark Ages (kind of an emo genre joke there tbh)  Poetrycore  Swancore  etc.

Defeater is next because the story of their discography is so sad. listener's lyrics are really complex and difficult to interpret some times, but they can be just as personal and depressing as Hotel Books if you put the time in with them. Personally I only like Wooden Heart by listener, but you may like the other one as well.  Honorable mention:  The World Is A Beautiful Place And I Am No Longer Afraid To Die  Mouthful, but I like their second to last album a lot. They are a pretty talented band."

Or once they tried to start it again, fucked it up again, then skipped it. Fucking embarrassing, so many of their fans of pissed off that night. Super amateur."

I'm hoping the rest of their music sounds more like ""hands like houses inspired"" and not ""hands like houses rip off"".

I have always had this deep down feeling of struggle and not quite having an answer for it. This album has opened my eyes and finally given this struggle a face and how to respond.

PostHardcore,3c7moz,coldjeanz,4,Sun Jul 5 19:52:21 2015 UTC,They had three really strong tracks in a row on the debut album (tracks 5-7) and then the Vic Fuentes song was actually pretty good. I am hoping they go in the direction of those songs because everything else on the album was completely generic and almost unlistenable.

PostHardcore,3c7moz,thesewordsarefake,4,Sun Jul 5 18:08:48 2015 UTC,I imagine half of them of working titles. The only ones named legitimately seem to be the features. And I wonder if this is what Tilian was hinting at during the ama. That Garrett rapp song is probably a reworked version of a scrapped song on the first album as they hinted at something in 2013 before slaves and when I asked about it garret replied with a winky face. Hopefully it is an old recording cause his voice has gone to shit.
PostHardcore,3c7moz,rjgoathead,2,Sun Jul 5 18:33:58 2015 UTC,Care to explain what Tillian hinted? I didn't read the AMA

It sounded sort of like Waves-era Moving Mountains. This sound seemingly came out of nowhere, as I don't think their other songs/demos sounded as close to MM as ""Lost"". I was super excited for the whole EP to be like this, but the other songs just don't hit as hard. The EP is definitely worth checking out though."

Here's the full list of bands that have their singer featured: The Dear Hunter, Portugal. The Man, Mewithoutyou, An Angle, The Audition, Saves the Day, This Providence, Say Anything, The Hush Sound, Panic! at the Disco, Gatsbys American Dream, The Matches, Man in the Blue Van, and Forgive Durden."

If you like the theatrical/concept album vibe of Razias definitely check out MWW's full length, Anchor - it's all great heavily World War Z inspired music about monsters (Blane's EP This Is My Town is also really good but hard to dig up).

PostHardcore,3c7e01,soggydave2113,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely not, but they were local to Seattle and managed to get on a lot of bookings with bigger Seattle acts and had tons of connections that way. They also got signed by Fueled by Ramen which makes up most of their other connections to better known performers.   I used to see them opening for Gatsbys, Danger: Radio, This Providence, etc all the time but they never really took off. You'll notice their two albums don't have much in common aside from lead vocals, there was a massive falling out between albums and he got the band name in the split and kept it (out of spite I think) though I don't believe he's ever performed much since the Wonderland album. Last I heard he was living in New York trying to stage Razias off-Broadway."

Shit's expensive otherwise. Make sure the backpack you bring is completely closed and/or locked. Bring a few water bottles so you can refill them. Bring plenty of cash. If you sweat a lot like I do, bring some towels. Don't buy drinks there if you're 21. They're awful and expensive. Drink beforehand. Bring a portable charger (or make sure your phone has insane battery). If your phone dies, make sure you and your friends have a meet up spot at a certain time or for certain situations.   It's really not that much; I just said a lot to be cautious. Warped Tour is a ton of fun, honestly. Just prepare for it how you would a normal road trip. If you're the pit kind, there's that for you.

PostHardcore,3c6pgu,IronTau,2,Sun Jul 5 15:11:20 2015 UTC,"People have given great advice on water and staying hydrated. I went to warped tour and I had expected my venue to do the bottle cap removal, but surprisingly they didn't (they do for other shows at that venue). They let me in with full waterbottles. Inside there is a water bottle filling station set up by warped tour I think so you get free refills on water. I feel like Warped Tour is very concerned with keeping people hydrated so that is nice. This was what happened at my venue, but it may also turn out like other people have described.   Other tips: they sell schedules for $2 but I just walked up to the big schedule sign by the main stages and took a pic with my phone. That was sufficient. If you are interested in seeings a bunch of bands, find out where the stages are located (easy enough by walking all around) so you can match it up with your schedule.   If you like guitar or bass, ernie ball music man had a stand set up that let you play guitars and basses plugged in to iPad amps. It was pretty cool."

PostHardcore,3c6pgu,rawshawn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:48:46 2015 UTC,you can't bring any type of drink except water. which is the most important thing at a warped tour  make sure it isnt open when you go in cause they'll make you dump it out. but for real get some snacks to eat cause you'll be hungry. also dont blow you energy at one show spread it out throughout the day and plan your attack and plan what bands you wanna see.     mostly just look up a video they usually cover everything

PostHardcore,3c6pgu,BDalyxx,2,Mon Jul 6 03:15:21 2015 UTC,"Adding to the water thing: just bring a refillable water bottle. Warped now has free stations to fill water bottles. It's unlimited. The lines are always busy, but it's well worth it! Cool Gear is the company that provides it, so look for that!"

The only reviews I found myself actively disagreeing with were The Bones of What You Believe, Hypersleep Chronicles, and Instant Gratification. I also dislike how he writes off most modern prog metal for having ""too clean production"" (he used that excuse for Periphery) and thinks CHON over indulges in ""noodlely"" guitar work (Polyphia is way worse in that regard, there's no riffs).   I feel like Fantano knows he doesn't like something and then proceeds to generalize other things based on those dislikes. He ventures out of a comfort zone (he did this with Instant Gratification) and then proceeds to rail against the fact that the new stuff he listened to didn't have anything he liked. He's too stubborn when it comes to certain genres to really give non-biased reviews about them, some of his best reviews are rap and a lot of his worst is the stuff on this end of the music spectrum."

PostHardcore,3bsyhu,Eezeebee,24,Wed Jul 1 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Worst: For the first two weeks I got terribly sick / was feverish because I drank some bad water or something and it was pretty hard on my morale, A Scopare Ma Non Sentire was actually written in this state and I feel like you can tell haha  Best: Probably the last day when I had the relief of completing the record and knew my friends were just a long drive away. Also, I decided to swim across an unpopulated lake one day and had an asthma attack halfway through and almost drowned. When I made it across I felt affirmed somehow that I could pull off my goal/could do anything. I swam across it every off day after that."

PostHardcore,3bsyhu,YourphobiaMyfetish,9,Wed Jul 1 22:22:38 2015 UTC,What was the hardest part about living in seclusion for alone.? Also any word on some new ALLB music?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,benjimangrec,13,Wed Jul 1 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"I hate to have such a boring answer, but the lonliness obviously. I really found out just how extroverted I am. Also, not being able to show what youre working on to your friends or get feedback kind of fucked with me. I dealt with A LOT of self doubt / had no idea if anything I was doing was any good."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,mrblahblahblacksheep,12,Wed Jul 1 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"And as far as ALLB:  Jams for LP IV are going to begin again this month, we have a new incredible musician in the band named Matt Coate and I am very excited to see what he brings to the table. We are hoping to get into the studio this winter."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,tobyTobias89,3,Wed Jul 1 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you don't compose most of the music for ALLB and then have drums filled in and teach everyone their parts? Not sure where I read that, but I thought that was how it worked."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,mrblahblahblacksheep,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:19 2015 UTC,Yas kween! Matt is just mesmerizing to listen too. You guys were already perfect. Just keep adding more perfect haha.  Also I love Danika in your new album. Will she be included with Matt?  Ok bye :)
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,GalacticCatt,6,Thu Jul 2 16:48:43 2015 UTC,I absolutely love this album. I can't wait for my pre order to finally ship.  Is there any thoughts of doing a solo tour with these songs? Maybe a Kurt Travis/alone. tour thing?  What kind of things did you bring with you when you were alone?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,Butt_Washington,9,Wed Jul 1 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"I would love to tour with this project, but unfortunately the album would have to be pretty successful for me to be able to pull that off financially. Unlike with ALLB where we are all in it for the long haul and willing to suffer a shitty tour pay out as an investment for our future, this band would entirely consist of hired musicians that I would have to pay fairly. Pulling that off with a brand new band that's never toured would be Very difficult. There's no money in this damn industry.  I brought my computer / recording equipment and instruments obviously, lots of books, downloaded lots of movies (most of them being sad movies that I never watched because I was too afraid of how they would affect my mood), cooking supplies/food, used the mattresses from our tour van to sleep on, lots of cigarettes (I actually started smoking again because of this album), a fishing pole, a bike, a projector and a sheet to project on, camping stuff. It was kinda like summer camp, except without friends."

PostHardcore,3bsyhu,TheHeedmeister,6,Fri Jul 3 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"Is there some sort of story or significance  behind How I Parted The Red Sea, or is it just a cool song with a lot of parts?  Also I think it's cool you're so involved with your fans, because obviously all musicians are grateful for them in some way or another, but you seem to take extra care to be open with them.  Keep up the good work and crazy guitar shit!"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,StutMoleFeet,6,Wed Jul 1 22:22:09 2015 UTC,"How I Parted the Red Sea is probably the Oldest ALLB song, besides maybe Sesame Street is no Place for Romance. As far as the title, I think I honestly thought it would just be really funny to take credit for and event in the bible. I can't remember what I was even going for with that song, I wrote it when I was like 17 and have forgotten what the process was even like. Listening to that song now is like listening to a friend's music, it's very foreign to me. I will say, to this day im still proud of that little bluesy wah wah solo."

Also, I tried to help you guys set up your Myspace page when you released Plan B. I just wanted to say that I've been following ALLB since, and I'm pumped for LP IV cause I can listen to No Place on repeat the whole way through and I'm sure another amazing album will come from you guys.  Keep it up, and tell Andy Westside hi."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,mrstuprigge,8,Wed Jul 1 22:23:25 2015 UTC,hahah get out of here Andy
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,Dogma3721,7,Wed Jul 1 23:22:57 2015 UTC,Do you ever see yourself writing more experimental music for ALLB like with Plan B ( my favorite recird of ALLB).
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,mrstuprigge,10,Wed Jul 1 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"I've seen a couple comments like this and it's always confusing for me. I think ALLB has stayed pretty consistently weird if not weirder than Plan B in recent history. Most of Plan B was in straight 4/4 or 6/8 and to me at least, was a fair bit less experimental than songs off No Place like Recluse or No Nature off No Place. I guess my youthful inexperience with writing music made for some weird structures, and all the movie quotes and weird noise stuff could be considered experimental. Definitely not opposed to being weird in anyway with ALLB records haha."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,NillasInTheRain,4,Wed Jul 1 23:21:11 2015 UTC,Well I guess what made sound more experimental was the guest horn parts. It seemed like more songs had less of a standard verse/chorus vibe and the random sound clips helped too.
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,C115551,5,Thu Jul 2 00:03:49 2015 UTC,"I've got two for you, Mikey:  You've written some absolutely crazy guitar riffs in your time. Is there any one that you're particularly proud of?  Which musician of your own generation do you draw the most inspiration from?"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,gyrorobo,6,Wed Jul 1 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't really pride myself on being a good at guitar, I've always been more focused on song writing than riffage. But the intro to ""Vanity's Fair"" seems to be the crowd favorite, it's like the go thing people cover. I like the intro riff to ""Orange Time Machines Care"", the tapping verse to ""Connector"", the intro riff to ""Please Try"" on the alone record, intro riff to ""Your Ex Marked My Spot"" and ""Sesame Street is no Place for Romance"" are very fun to play, really liked the lead melody for the chorus of ""Shaking of the Frame"""
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,ExistentialistCowboy,7,Wed Jul 1 23:36:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, and as far as inspiration, I guess ill be typical and say omar rodriguez lopez has always been a big inspiration for ALLB. The man is an incredibly hard worker and is probably the most influential modern musician I can think of. I have no met a band dude who can't say Deloused changed the way they think about music.  Aaron Marsh of Copeland and Mike Sullivan of Russian Circles were a pretty big influence on alone."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,tirasleen,5,Wed Jul 1 23:49:11 2015 UTC,"Hi Michael, thanks for doing this AMA!   What song(s) would you recommend to someone who had never listened to your work in alone. and Sianvar?"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,JAD210,7,Wed Jul 1 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person honestly, when I show people my music and care if they like it I try to pick the song that I think would suit their taste.   but for the general public, I'd say ""Close Without Closure"" and ""Redundant, Redundant"" are a good starting point for alone.  ""Substance Sequence"" is my favorite Sianvar song to show people, but I was not a part of the Sianvar EP, who knows which song will come out the best once the LP im on is done being recorded!"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,DavidR525,9,Wed Jul 1 22:31:07 2015 UTC,"Considering your little logo next to your name is Hands Like Houses, Im guessing youre into heavy stuff, in which case I'd recommend ""A Scopare Ma Non Sentire"" or my minor key cover of ""You Are My Sunshine"" off the alone. record."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,DavidR525,7,Wed Jul 1 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"Do you think the release of Somewhere in the sierras will in any way effect the sound of the next A Lot Like Birds album, for example, less ""softer"" parts and more ""heavier"" stuff?  Also any chance of a pedalboard update?  Lastly I'd just like to say that I've given somewhere in the sierras multiple listens and it's a masterpiece front to back. Congratulations on such a successful release and thanks in advance."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,GalacticCatt,8,Wed Jul 1 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"I have no idea honestly, we will have to see. It would be extremely difficult for me to write an all ""heavy"" record, I like using ""heavy"" as a dynamic and not so much an exclusive style. I will say I think this next record may have less screaming and more singing from Cory though. He's been working on his voice and it sounds great. I really can't say anything for certain, because it's always different once the songs start happening and you can to see what they call for.  Oh man, my board is a mess right now, maybe once I get it all set up and ready for LP IV jams I will post a pic or something haha. Theres some additions I need to make to it for this next record for sure.  Thank you so much! It has been such a relief to hear people aren't let down after a goddamn YEAR of hype haha."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,comicbook_koala,4,Wed Jul 1 22:41:55 2015 UTC,How was your experience doing a crowd funded album and would you recommend it as a good way for other bands to fund an album?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,comicbook_koala,6,Wed Jul 1 22:25:53 2015 UTC,"I have very mixed feeling about it. Sites like Indiegogo provide a cool platform and really help with organization and presentation of a campaign, but after all the IG and Paypal hidden fees, I only took home 10,500 out of the 13 grand I raised. This record actually put me into 4 grand worth of debt (after paying for all the vinyl, cds, and tapes up front and shipping all the rewards) so I'd recommend anyone considering doing a campaign to price everything high enough to cover fees and shipping and make sure everything you offer has a very high profit margin. Offering stuff with value to your fans but doesn't has cost of goods is the best way to really raise money. If I could go back, I'd probably research making my own website and having the money go straight to my paypal, bypassing the need for kickstarter or IG."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,RobVanished,3,Wed Jul 1 23:09:34 2015 UTC,Just finished the Vox Vocis kickstarter. Thanks for the words of wisdom. When you guys going to come crash again in Houston?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,russianbear28,4,Thu Jul 2 01:58:26 2015 UTC,Has it been weird playing bass in sianvar? Have you had much experience with bass in the past or has it all been new to you?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,fuddlez,5,Wed Jul 1 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"I love bass, I have always written bass for ALLB and did all the bass on alone. It is weird having that be my actual role in the band, but they are all so damn talented and fun to play with that it would be hard not to enjoy. I'm an extremely rhythmically minded musician, so being the link between melody and rhythm really plays to my strengths"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,atom_atom_atom,3,Wed Jul 1 23:15:46 2015 UTC,I've been listening to the album all week pretty much on repeat and it's simply amazing. I've also been reading the liner notes so the only thing i really want to know is;  Do you think you'll ever make any more alone. music and if so would you want to work with the same musicians or would you want to expand more and work with different people for a different sound.  Thanks.
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,atom_atom_atom,7,Wed Jul 1 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"It would have to be a ways down the line, but I'd love to do another alone. record and isolate myself in a completely different setting/way. Maybe go to a country where no one speaks english or a small island or a desert, etc. And I have no clue about musicians. I think it could be cool to change it up but I had some damn good musicians on Somewhere in the Sierras and they would be hard to top."
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,lordfuzzywig,3,Wed Jul 1 22:35:36 2015 UTC,Hello! I saw you in New York when A Lot Like Birds played support for Enter Shikari on tour. It was my first time seeing you guys and can I just say your performance is incredibly inspiring + mesmerizing? My question is... Why do you play barefoot?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,afrojacksparrow,5,Wed Jul 1 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"you Can say that, Thank you!  It's because I have a lot of pedals and I'm too goddamn clumsy to utilize them with shoes on haha."

Edit: actually I'll throw in a question. Any hints or info on anything new with ALLB? Or is everyone a bit too busy to be focused on it right now?
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,MaceWinnoob,4,Wed Jul 1 22:25:44 2015 UTC,Hugs are cool with me.  LP IV jams begin again this month. I pretty stoked to do so because we recently acquired a STELLAR musician by the name of Matt Coate in the band and i cant wait to see what he brings to the table.
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,Niksono93,3,Wed Jul 1 22:53:37 2015 UTC,If you could keep getting crowd funding for these sorts of projects would you do it again? (be it in the forest or not) I feel like you could contact other artists in both the Posthc and other music genres and have many concept albums like this with all different vibes and feels.

I've always loved the solo on Sesame Street Is No Place For Me and thought your note choices were excellent. I'd like to know, do you plan on having any solos on LP IV?"

As mentioned above, I've never really prided myself on being a good guitar player, I focus more on composition than riffs or being a guitar virtuoso or something. I am not opposed to solo's being in future music, I just don't really connect to solo's a lot of the time and they seem to be a dead art. Solo's have always just felt super self indulgent to me."

Close without Closure is a fantastic song and the lyrics on Redundant, Redundant are one of my favorite parts of the album. Both those songs are my favorite so far.  I feel like being alone for that long must have given you tons of time to contemplate life. What do you think the most important thing you learned, about yourself or otherwise, from this experience? Also, what are some of your favorite parts of the album? Are there any parts that really stick out to you as being extra special?"
PostHardcore,3bsyhu,Niksono93,6,Thu Jul 2 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think the most important think I took away was being forced to learn how to be ok with being left with only my thoughts to entertain me. I think the induction of the smart phone has all but killed this necessary life skill in society. Being distracted and being numb does not make for great art or self reflection. I think just being forced to have everything in my day be purposeful was extremely beneficial, and it taught me some tools for being more productive in my life. It also made me really appreciate all the wonderful people in my life, I re-fell in love with every dear friend of mine.  Fav parts of the album:  Ill just do it song by song. All my answers will probably just be expanding on the track by track, so check that out here: http://newnoisemagazine.com/exclusive-stream-alone-somewhere-in-the-sierras/  A Scopare Ma Non Sentire:  Pulling off that operatic Italian and having it achieve the effect I was going for/not sound cheesy was no easy feat. I knew it was going to be a pretty ballsy move to not only sing like that considering the vocal styles people are used to with A Lot Like Birds, but then also having it be in Italian making it extra off the wall so it had to be done right and im proud of how it turned out.  Leave Me: The vocal arrangement in the verses was the first thing I did vocally for this record (at the time I wasnt even sure I wanted to sing on the record) and it somehow turned out to be my favorite. The harmonies make no sense in the best way.  An interlude for andrew dammar/ close without closure:  singing in this falsetto style is really easy to make nasally / not relatable. Im really proud of pulling it off in the way I did. Also, the end is the most emotional i felt tracking besides Maternity Leave. I was quite literally singing my heart out and from what I've gathered from response people can tell.  Please Try:  I love that I wrote a pop song I don't hate. The ending of this song came out as powerful as I had hoped and I'm very grateful for it.  1 (800) 273 8255  This song is really special because it happened on accident.  It came about when I was teaching Joe all the songs in preparation for him tracking, and we kind of just had one of those moments where we got bored and branched off into noodling on our instruments. I starting playing this chord progression that kind of sounded as pretty as it was sad to me and Joe was sort of just free form solo-ing to clear his head. As this went on for a while I got to thinking about how it could be interesting to contrast a really beautiful song with something chaotic and tension ridden. The drum performance  on the record is raw and unedited and was basically just a stream of consciousness on joes part. It is one of the more experimental ideas I had, and im pleased with how it turned out because it could have been waaay too weird haha  More Fiend:  Super proud of my vocal melody/performance on the choruses. Also really love the ambient bridge at 2:24. We referred to it as the ""Under the Sea"" part in the studio  You are my sunshine:  This song and A Scopare have the most fucking heavy bass tone i've ever achieved on a record. Kudos to Dryw for getting it to sound the way it did. I also love that when the song goes into the acoustic verse, we got it sound as if your being sucked into a vortex or something and my voice has this pinched filter effect on it once the verse comes in.  Maternity Leave:  Definitely the most emotion i've ever put into a song. The strings in this song, especially starting at 2:34 are my most prided arrangement."

PostHardcore,3bsyhu,packalip,3,Wed Jul 1 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"Joe begins recording drums for Sianvar this month, I track shortly after. We are going to try to put it out as soon as possible after we record it, probably this winter.  As far as writing, Sianvar is a completely different process than what I'm used to. All the songs are written completely collaboratively, and almost like stream of consciousness jammed out. Sergio or Will just bring some ideas to the table and we hammer them out, some are even just thought up on the spot. They are all killer musicians, so we all just go with our gut reactions and trust in our abilities enough to be cool with what comes out."

PostHardcore,3bsi1k,FUK_UR_FAITH,3,Thu Jul 2 02:56:13 2015 UTC,You should just make a sequel to the EP with redone versions of each song

It was like, 2008 I think and I went camping with some friends and one of the guys had this cd and knew i liked atreyu and put this on. The opening riff had me hooked and i've never looked back."
PostHardcore,3brdzn,teamherosquad,2,Wed Jul 1 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"My first listen was in 2006, I was a sophomore in high school and was heading over to hang out with this dude after school. His older friend came and picked us up and was listening to this CD and I was just kind of letting it go in one ear and out the other until this track came on, suddenly I was super interested. I asked the older dude and he gave me a copy of the CD and I haven't looked back."

But the coolest thing that I remember was Craig walked out into the crowd and people just help him up. He walked out a good twenty feet or something and back and people just held him up like it was nothing.
PostHardcore,3brdzn,Iammandough,2,Wed Jul 1 21:38:58 2015 UTC,"I fucking love when he does that. It's so cool to just see him on top of everyone belting out whatever song they're playing. Some of the stuff he does during their sets is just incredible to watch, he's got amazing stage presence and really demands your attention."

PostHardcore,3bsd0p,fumblefinger,3,Thu Jul 2 02:22:19 2015 UTC,Thats heartbreaking
PostHardcore,3bsd0p,uberhaxorowen,3,Thu Jul 2 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"Did r/posthardcore just COMPLETELY ignore the new album they dropped yesterday? The news of their reunion was met with little attention here and since it dropped on youtube a week ago, I haven't seen so much as one word spoken about it here.   I for one, like it a lot. Decidedly milder, but still good. My biggest gripe is the missed opportunity to comment lyrically on their place in the canon of human culture. More politics and in a less relatable direction. Still good."
PostHardcore,3bsd0p,JeffroTheMan,2,Thu Jul 2 06:08:26 2015 UTC,"This is just my personal observation, but /r/posthardcore passes over a lot of the classics in favor of contemporary names like DGD, Chiodos, ADTR, etc. etc. There are a few folks on here who appreciate the classics, but we're in the minority here."

It's just not what I expected from Senses Fail at all even with them venturing into hardcore... I love it. But yeah it's either this or Unlived Life.

Look, I like the guilty pleasure and I love DGD and Swancore as much as everyone else but can we please get some more exposure to newer/different artists?   I love it when a far out band like Ling Tosite Sigure gets posted, I love it when someone releases their own project and posts it here (shout out to Adventurer), I love it when someone shares something I've never seen before.  But all these mid 2ks bands? Bleh. It's just boring."
PostHardcore,3bndou,RufinTheFury,5,Tue Jun 30 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"I like it when bands post their own work on here but it always seems like they get downvoted into death or little to no attention at all (some of mine were treated this way personally but that's just reddit, I guess). Whereas we love to upvote and discuss on the same old bands.   This sub has lead me to loving some great new bands though, so, I forgive it. Looking at you, Adventurer, Stolas, and I the Mighty."
PostHardcore,3bndou,VismundxCygnus,3,Tue Jun 30 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I won't deny that this sub has gotten me into some really great music. I wouldn't be listening to Circa Survive or a lot of the Swancore bands if this place wasn't around. It also introduced me to Juneva who I love so I'll always like this place.  But yeah, like you said, people love to downvote OC for some reason. I think they view it as a self-promotion and want to punish it for whatever reason (and yes it is self-promotion but no that's not a bad thing imo)."
PostHardcore,3bndou,RufinTheFury,2,Tue Jun 30 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, it is but so long as it's not excessive I don't think it's a bad thing. I've posted here twice promoting my own projects in 3 years (one was acoustic, so maybe that's why it was voted down, idk), I think that's cool or even a few more if it's good actual content.   Like you said though, it can be tough."
PostHardcore,3bndou,VismundxCygnus,3,Tue Jun 30 23:35:17 2015 UTC,I vote them up even when I don't like them unless it's spam because someone might be a new fan.
PostHardcore,3bndou,caseharts,4,Wed Jul 1 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but exactly my point.  I remember when ""post-hardcore"" was a genre assigned to bands with heavier, hardcore inspired instrumentals and mostly clean vocals. Bands like Emarosa, Balance And Composure, and Make Do And Mend (granted the latter has a huge punk influence). Hell, I even consider Chiodos to be post-hardcore now, even though their latest album is terrible. But again, heavier instrumentals, mostly clean vocals, etc. etc. etc."
PostHardcore,3bndou,LeStephenHawking,5,Tue Jun 30 17:53:06 2015 UTC,IDK about that definition of post-hardcore. Rites of Spring and Fugazi basically had 0 clean vocals in their music. On the other hand At the Drive-In is basically only cleans.  Really there's not a set formula for being post-hardcore outside of sounding like a Hardcore Punk band but with more guitar wankery.
PostHardcore,3bndou,RufinTheFury,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"I think that's why it bothers me. I have zero issues with emo, in fact I still listen to a lot of it with nostalgia today. But that said, I feel like ""post-hardcore"" is a label that is now (it didn't used to be) thrown onto just about any rock-ish band that is hard to define. It's so loose a definition that it drives me crazy.   Sorry for all the ranting folks :)"
PostHardcore,3bndou,LeStephenHawking,2,Tue Jun 30 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that post-hardcore has become an umbrella term all on its own, like saying ""rock"" or ""metal."" Within post-hardcore we have a bunch of subgenres created by the fans and these are usually pretty accurate. Swancore, Poetrycore, Mid2ks, First Wave, Second Wave, etc.  Meanwhile emo is a pretty solid term. If someone says emo I can usually imagine what kind of band is gonna play depending on whether it's First Wave, Second Wave, or Emo Revival. That's only three different branches to pick and choose from."
PostHardcore,3bndou,RufinTheFury,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"There are two different kinds of hardcore punk nowadays. One you'd refer to as ""hardcore punk"" - eg. Minor Threat, earlier Black Flag, Descendents. And then just ""hardcore"" which are basically just fast metal songs with screamed vocals.  Because of these two different kinds of hardcore, there are two different kinds of post-hardcore. I'm not a fan of one of them, myself, but I understand why they would call it that."
PostHardcore,3bndou,Tazmily228,2,Thu Jul 2 10:35:57 2015 UTC,"Vocals don't define post-hardcore in my book.  A Lot Like Birds is definitely first and foremost post-hardcore but they are at least half unclean. Or Alexisonfire, their first album had A LOT of unclean but it's still considered a definitive post-hardcore band.  Post-hardcore is very hard to define in itself and I usually use it as a blanket term for many things. It's an ever changing/growing genre.  I mean look at NoMeansNo's ""Wrong"" and then compare with DGD's ""Instant Gratification"". You wouldn't even guess they would be considered the same genre at all, but times change and terms become more flexible."
PostHardcore,3bndou,gyrorobo,3,Tue Jun 30 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"if you consider their ""prime"" when they made the most money (last 8-10 years) than you may be right.  But I would say thats a horrible definition of a band's prime, and in that case, you couldn't be more wrong.  AFI helped define post hardcore....yes with their earliest stuff, but also with black sails and art of drowning.  I can't tell you how many post-hardcore bands have said AFI was a major influence. everyone in the mid 90s knew what post hardcore was, that's when bands like AFI began defining the genre.  Not going to downvote you for having an opinion either way."
PostHardcore,3bndou,afihavok,2,Tue Jun 30 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I think I'd go ahead and classify their early work as straight up hardcore punk, it was somewhere around the Art of Drowning/Sing the Sorrow albums that they started to sound like less a hardcore punk band and more of a post hardcore band. It's really just being pedantic though, I don't see a reason why they can't flirt between genres."
PostHardcore,3bndou,poopfeast,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"No worries, and I'll admit that I stopped listening to AFI in middle school, somewhere around 2003ish. So I don't know where they've gone since then, and frankly do not care. But from what I remember their lyrics were very dark and what I would definitely consider emotional."
PostHardcore,3bndou,LeStephenHawking,3,Tue Jun 30 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"they were writing their best, true post hardcore stuff when you were in elementary school. at any rate, there were/are lots of dark, emotional post hardcore bands..."
PostHardcore,3bndou,afihavok,2,Tue Jun 30 18:01:37 2015 UTC,I don't consider any music emo really ask that music falls under post hxc for me now.  Emo was more of a era for me that went beyond music for better or worse.    I watched go by in a weird way it was sort of surreal.   But to the punt posy hard core is just a basket we throw heavier bands that don't lean towards the death metal etc.  Maybe it's a sub genre. At this point I just want to listen to music afi us connected to many of these bands so don't throw a fit enjoy it.
PostHardcore,3bndou,caseharts,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"Nah emo is a very distinct and identifiable genre. Usually characterized by mood and musical passion taken from hardcore punk, but with a heavier emphasis on instrumental technical work taken from alternative and indie. Usually with high-strung, often ""twinkly"" lead guitar lines."

PostHardcore,3bn2ee,SergeantFartbox,6,Tue Jun 30 18:12:07 2015 UTC,I think this and their EP are miles ahead of the following two albums. The second JC album sounds like a JC album featuring Emarosa. The new one is good but it doesn't sound like either of the EP or Relativity. I also think that the keyboards are so boring in everything past their first EP.
PostHardcore,3bn2ee,JimmyMcShiv,-3,Wed Jul 1 01:56:22 2015 UTC,Totally agree. JC has a habit of ruining a band's future.

PostHardcore,3bn2ee,the_cat91,2,Tue Jun 30 20:35:38 2015 UTC,yeah you're right! I don't want them to lose their singer but the new album it's very boring musically (the singing it's very good IMO).

PostHardcore,3bn2ee,caseharts,2,Wed Jul 1 06:32:22 2015 UTC,The biggest issue I think with the new album is Jonas leaving. Jonny is great I love him but Jonas is a great guitarist and people forget he left.

But very few albums are able to please me with every song. I still think No Place is one of the best, most comprehensively written albums I've ever heard so I was probably expecting a little too much from alone. Still very good and very different."
PostHardcore,3bopfg,DanceShomoDance,2,Wed Jul 1 15:20:09 2015 UTC,I didn't like that song on my first lesson buts in grown on me. I would suggest reading the track by track and listening to the album a couple more times. It seems to get better each time.

PostHardcore,3bjw6n,xxthanatos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"This whole album is incredible. Nick DePirro is probably one of most talented guitarists in PH today, the amount of space he fills being the only guitar player in the band is insane."
PostHardcore,3bjw6n,EliteCombine07,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:20:18 2015 UTC,I really wish this band would get more recognition. Instrumentally they are beyond phenomenal in my opinion.  I randomly saw the sleeping opening up at a concert without knowing who they even were. I left that concert more excited that I saw them then the headliner. Doug has so much energy.
PostHardcore,3binci,smashinmuffins,4,Mon Jun 29 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'm in love with this album. It's far from their best imo, but it's still a great album. Favorite songs are Dying Words (Senses Fail Mathcore wtf?!), Wounds, and My Fear of an Unlived Life. Can't wait to see them play some of the songs on Warped. Anyone know what songs off this album they play?"
PostHardcore,3binci,Chicken421,3,Mon Jun 29 16:57:29 2015 UTC,Just saw them Saturday. The only ones they played off this album were The Three Marks of Existence and The Importance Of The Moment Of Death. Phenomenal set though!
PostHardcore,3binci,cekovsky,3,Mon Jun 29 18:55:20 2015 UTC,Oh nice. The Importance of the Moment of Death has grown on me a lot in context of the rest of the album rather than as a single. Can't wait.
PostHardcore,3binci,Chicken421,2,Mon Jun 29 20:08:18 2015 UTC,Same here...and getting to hear it live has helped even more. Buddy's stage presence has never been better.

PostHardcore,3binci,BreezyF_Jamie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:54:10 2015 UTC,"I might be crazy but am I the only one that feels like this album is really sub-par? The lyrics are not as well written as they have been on previous albums. The word courage is re-used probably 1000 times. The guitar work, while heavy, seems very bland to me. It lacks the amazing riffs that Garret brought to the table. Ill even say Zack had better guitar work on Renacer. I do enjoy some moments on here. I actually find it odd because previous to this album, Senses Fails heavy shit has been whats drawn me in but my favorite parts on this record are the softer songs and slower parts in the songs I.e: Wounds, Surrender, etc.. Im going to keep listening (because I refuse to give up on this band) and hopefully something will open my eyes. But so far nothings really doing much for me on this one."
PostHardcore,3binci,DjentDavinDjent,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah some motifs are overused. But Seriously Dying Words thats thier hardest song, and I think this is a great album"
PostHardcore,3binci,headbanger1186,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:55:00 2015 UTC,"I fall in love with every album they have, since their shift to a more hardcore sound with Renacer, it just goes to show you don't have to get soft with age. Plus the recent articles about Buddy and his struggle with male prostitutes, hiding things about himself and everything just brings all this anger together in one beautiful album."

PostHardcore,3bby8k,ImBored_YoureAmorous,16,Sat Jun 27 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I have a question about your songwriting process. I was wondering what everyone in the bands level of involvement is in creating a new song, music and everything?  And a specific question for Jon: I know you get questions about how weird your lyrics are, I was wondering if you have an idea in mind when you're laying out a song, or if it just comes to you at that moment?  Til I love your voice and I want to adopt it and raise it as my own."
PostHardcore,3bby8k,moshlyfe,42,Sat Jun 27 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I do like to map out the phrasing first, but i will often write parts ahead of time and have ammo to fit things in if need be. Could hear an instrumental and get ideas real quick. Other times I might go into the bank cause I knew something I had would fit. Sometimes I can't work out shit and drop gibberish to draw out phrasings, and then just let it cook in my head as I switch out words, maybe hit up the rhyme dictionary to move through the options faster. The process can vary, so there are pre written and concept stuff that I do, and other times its intuitive fun percussive stuff, it depends on what the instrumental sounds like, if you've ever listened to the instrumental demos of the band, that's what Im getting to write off, those songs already have a personality before I write over them, so for a lot of my most nonsensical shit is sometimes a reaction to what sounds to me like some quirky ass shit. But then another example, Dbm2 I went pretty far out there a lot of the time cause the situation with Jonny at the time made the album a bizarre experience, maybe Will's best and most technical album, and I was struggling with the writting cause I had to take over and fill shit up cause Jonny was deep in the hole mentally."

PostHardcore,3bby8k,Turbobutts,14,Sat Jun 27 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"Will:  I've seen some pictures of this guitar and couldn't determine what kind it was. Could you go into more detail about it(i.e. brand, history, body/neck composition, pickups/electronics especially that funky looking knob above the neck pickup) because its definitely an interesting looking guitar.  For all of the instrumentalists:  Are there specific qualities you look for in your instruments?  Or do you tend to keep them varied? DGD has an extremely unique but diverse catalog which really sets you guys apart from the vast majority of other artists, so I was wondering if a diversity of gear contributes to this.  Tillian:  Your vocals are incredible and I honestly think your mastery of the falsetto register provides an excellent contrast to Jon's vocals and melds beautifully with the instrumentals.  However, I have seen that it is generally believed there is a severe diminishment in timbre when men sing in falsetto over modal.  Is achieving timbre in your vocal range a challenge to achieve, or do you try to focus on the production aspect instead? (i.e. a ""ringing"" sound as opposed to a ""breathy"" sound)"

I thought a lot of your lyrics were less narrative-oriented and were more intended for flow, conveying a message through unconventional metaphor, or things that sound good (alliteration, rhyme, consonance, assonance, that sort of thing more within a single line rather than the verse/stanza as a whole). Do you go for both that and narrative at the same time when you can, or do you have a certain structure you like to work with? Basically, what percent blend of meaning vs. nothing do you like most?"

He's very clever and knowledgeable, but it's also painfully clear that a lot of the tropes and standards of these kinds of genres are things he doesn't enjoy. Even in hip-hop, he seems to admire more forward looking acts like Death Grips compared to things like J. Cole, who seem to refine their sound more than simply pushing forward incessantly. Which for me, I enjoy the push and pull of a musician working to truly refine and perfect their own individual voice rather than just marching forward and never developing any of their initial ideas.  I dunno, just my feelings that maybe these kind of albums aren't right for his reviews."

PostHardcore,3b3haj,chevello,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:31:12 2015 UTC,I dig this more than their debut CD. I could only get into a couple songs on that album.
PostHardcore,3b3haj,knowhope4L,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:03:25 2015 UTC,I like this a lot but I feel like the vocals are mixed a little too quietly compared to everything else. Don't get me wrong the instrumentation is beautiful but I think this song could have used a little more oomph from the vocals. Just my opinion but I still loved this song and I'll definitely be checking more of these guys out now!

PostHardcore,3b356p,prima_vista,11,Thu Jun 25 16:14:21 2015 UTC,One of those 'gone too soon' artists that disbanded after just a couple of records. They put out some really awesome stuff before they went though; love the production and the metallic edge to this one.

A hurricane hit the day before the show. I decided to not drive to Tampa because traffic is unpredictable and people go nuts buying all the gas they can right before and after storms.  I told myself that Bear Vs. Shark will be back, they just put out a new record.  Then they break up 2 months later.  Hurricanes are the worst."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,abandoningdoug,5,Thu Jun 25 13:19:13 2015 UTC,I've noticed that these guy's are not as popular as they should be. Any theories?
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,Jrocker-ame,8,Thu Jun 25 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"People have negative connotations about this band. ""Oh its only for the scene/emo kids."" They aren't ""heavy"" or ""hard"" enough for the tough guy crowd, meanwhile they're too dark/story driven to really attract girls who wanna hear poppy break-up songs. They really are a talented band (especially in terms of storytelling) but I've found the only people I know who enjoy them, were people who heard them with an unbiased opinion going into it."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,andreasmiles23,7,Thu Jun 25 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"Also, I personally feel like they were a lot bigger a few years ago than they are now. Just time going by and losing fan base"
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,Pickle_Jr,4,Thu Jun 25 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. I think people were really let down by A Place Where the Sun is Silent (I was as well), especially after the hype of The Emptiness. Then there was such a long break between that album and Confessions that I think they lost a lot of steam."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,andreasmiles23,3,Thu Jun 25 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those people. Listened to everything they released before realizing I didn't like APWtSiS as much as the others. The Emptiness was really damn good and even the music videos were, too.   I don't know, should I try to get into them again?"

PostHardcore,3b2j4w,desutruction,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:36:15 2015 UTC,"Which is strange because I loved the fuck out of APWtSiS (after giving it a couple listens to be fair). It was so theatrical and full of catchy instrumentation despite being not as heavy as the Emptiness. Certainly a different direction though. I've come to like all their albums just because they all sound different enough to be fresh, but still at the core have the band's sound."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,waict,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that it has the band's sound, and I love the instrumentals (I listen to the instrumental versions of the songs all the time) but I just felt that the story was too forced that album. And that showed up in the really bad melodies/vocal patterns."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,andreasmiles23,2,Fri Jun 26 03:35:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, the story itself was a bit forced and did not compare to emptiness. It was kinda cool, but im more for the instruments and music in apwtsis."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,waict,2,Fri Jun 26 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah they spent too much time not releasing music, touring, or being active on social media and kind of faded into obscurity."

PostHardcore,3b2j4w,Iammandough,3,Thu Jun 25 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I used to just be dumbfounded as to why so many people would rag on them. I never understood, then in talking to other friends who like this music, and people at shows or whatever, I came to this conclusion."
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,andreasmiles23,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:13 2015 UTC,They were my favorite band for the longest time when in middle school. I remember when I had The Emptiness on cd and it came with the little story. I was so moved with how amazing it was.
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,Iammandough,3,Thu Jun 25 21:30:23 2015 UTC,I remember demanding my mom to drive me to Target immediately after school the day that album released. Then I remember curling up in my bed and reading the story as I listened to it the first time. One of my favorite memories ever.
PostHardcore,3b2j4w,andreasmiles23,3,Thu Jun 25 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah guys, The Emptiness was incredible. The best thing was is that I heard this album first- then The Emptiness landed them into one of my favourite bands.  Haven't listened to the new album much though."

PostHardcore,3azr0o,Emandiputs,2,Thu Jun 25 06:42:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course.  We started as a group of friends at school (although we cycled through a few line-up changes since then) but id say we've all got pretty varied musical influences, so when we write a draft for a song, we have plenty of ideas of how we can craft the track or where we can take it... I'd say our core sound takes a fair amount of influence from deftones, finch, oceansize with just a touch of djent in a couple of the tracks. But we write music we feel is slightly different which is why we're still a band. Although we're unsigned and can't meet up or gig as often as we'd like, we enjoy what we do and love getting feedback from people who enjoy our music."
PostHardcore,3azr0o,YWAG,9,Thu Jun 25 07:01:07 2015 UTC,www.wearetheaccident.com/albums  We're playing with letlive in July and working on our full length. We gig with Adventurer a good bit too since we're in the same Detroit scene. You guys will be seeing us around a lot this spring ;)
PostHardcore,3azr0o,sirjohnbonham,3,Wed Jun 24 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Man, I was not expecting  the rapping. Who influenced you guys?"
PostHardcore,3azr0o,YourphobiaMyfetish,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"That's a fun question to answer. That old EP is lackluster in general and especially compared to what we're doing now, but Over The Edge is the only one we still play from it. That one in particular has a lot of generic metalcore influences (that we have since moved away from), but Enter Shikari influenced the bridge a good bit. The guy who did the raps was huge into Linkin Park and still is. I think all of us grew up on Linkin Park. Like I still love their new material."
PostHardcore,3azr0o,sirjohnbonham,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:50:17 2015 UTC,That's great. The first thing I thought if what Mike Shinoda when he started rapping. Linkin Park was my favorite band up until Minutes to Midnight (so from when I was about 3 until I was maybe 10) and I still enjoy their old stuff and Fort Minor. What kind of bands would you say influence your next release?
PostHardcore,3azr0o,YourphobiaMyfetish,2,Fri Jun 26 05:22:36 2015 UTC,"I hated Minutes To Midnight and 1000 suns or whatever, but I actual dig their last two releases a lot.   Our new stuff has been influenced by a ton of bands. We tried our best to move away generic breakdowns, but there will still be a few in the album. That encompasses our metalcore influences. On the drumming end of things, I have been listening to a TON of Swancore. Although my parts are nothing crazy technical, it has pushed me to dig deeper into my craft. I have been hanging out with the drummer of Wolfshark and learning tricks from him that will be on the second half of the album. That guy is a beast. I generally try to incorporate as many influences as possible in my drumming. There will be tracks with influences from The Neighbourhood and tracks with influences from Every Time I Die, or even songs with influences from both ends of the spectrum.  In general, it is heavily rooted Taking Back Sunday, but with classic Sum 41 and Blink 182 roots in there. From there, we pushed ourselves to be creative and mixed in some of the metalcore/post-hardcore stuff, as well as a ton of indie and pop influences. From Indian Lakes has influenced one of our songwriters a lot. We all go out to an absurd amount of shows, so I guarantee there's some of that thrown in there. Although we listen to a decent bit of the same music, we also listen to a lot of different music within ourselves, so that helps.  I think the result of all of this should be something that sounds familiar from the Taking Back Sunday roots, but I think it will also offer something that most people haven't heard yet... hopefully haha."
PostHardcore,3azr0o,sirjohnbonham,2,Fri Jun 26 13:15:42 2015 UTC,That sounds great man. I'll be waiting to hear it.

PostHardcore,3azr0o,ImBored_YoureAmorous,3,Thu Jun 25 02:37:52 2015 UTC,Awesome band name. I listened to Link Time Optimization and it was awesome--seriously. Is instrumental music a desire or are you just lacking a capable vocalist?
PostHardcore,3azr0o,ii386,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:45:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude!  Here's a quick collab of an older song of mine with a vocalist that never got finished.    Here's the original instrumental  I'd love a vocalist -- I think it could really complete the sound. Unfortunately, I just haven't been too proactive on getting one.  Every one I've tried out ends up never being a good fit for the music (I'm probably really picky, actually).  But the search continues!"
PostHardcore,3azr0o,ImBored_YoureAmorous,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:52:21 2015 UTC,I'm just amazed that this is all done by you. I've gotta wonder since you are able to compose all the other instruments: do you also get a good feel of what vocal melodies you'd want in your songs?   I wish there was a subreddit where an instrumental track is posted and vocalists put a track over it.
PostHardcore,3azr0o,ii386,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:52:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks again!  I identify mainly as a bass player.  I'm not much of a guitarist.  I also can't play drums, so I learned how to program them (It's really fun, actually!). Anyway, I just try to get ideas down when I'm feeling it.    I can't really sing, so I never really think of it when I'm writing, but after the fact, I'll sit there and try to sing melodies to it, but they generally suck.  Usually any high-register ""easy"" melody you hear in a song is what I think could be substituted as vocals.    I wish there was a subreddit where an instrumental track is posted and vocalists put a track over it.    I think there is, but I can't remember what it's called.  I remember feeling very intimidated by it because it seemed to mostly be hip-hop and electronic music."

I think maybe we first played with them on a show with our mutual friends in a band called Sharkbait (from Lafayette, LA) 4 or years ago. We just kinda hit it off really hard and would book shows from them, play shows with them, and house them any chance we got. When we recorded that EP we were looking for a label and also already planning on doing a tour with them that spring. So they pitched the split idea to their label and the label ran with it. They put it out on tape which was fun. I actually ran across a few of the other day. Ah, nostalgia."

As someone already said, a lot of DGD stuff with Tilian gives me a ""happy"" feeling. I've never really gotten into them before, but I'm liking their new album. Listen through Instant Gratification.  Our Last Night - Road to the Throne  Too Close To Touch - Pretty Little Thing  Icarus The Owl - Ignore Check Engine Lights (check out some of their other stuff too)  I the Mighty - Artful Temptress  Hands Like Houses - No Parallels  You could go through some ADTR stuff too. They've got a handful of songs you'd probably like.  That's some of the stuff I can think of off the top of my head. Maybe try out some pop-punk stuff too? I think you'll find something you like there.  EDIT: Look up the Our Last Night song elsewhere because that video kinda blows. Someone fucked with it. Spotify would be your best bet :) I swapped the link out anyways, so hopefully that one is better!"

Craig has been awfully quiet for awhile now though. Not like him to stay out of the limelight for toooo long so I imagine they have something in the works.

PostHardcore,3ayxsa,glowsox,7,Thu Jun 25 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"I think Devil was a really nice album. It had some more ""radio ready"" songs that could have brought a ton of mainstream success.

PostHardcore,3ayxsa,beachdude42,2,Wed Jun 24 18:36:03 2015 UTC,I agree with the D.R.U.G.S statement. They album they put out was amazing. But Devil was good as well. I'd rank it above Bone Palace Ballet but below All's Well that Ends Well.

PostHardcore,3ave79,B0mb-Hands,2,Wed Jun 24 04:38:00 2015 UTC,"So does the album have a song by song concept or is it individual stories connecting to various cities, at least that is how I am picturing it?"
PostHardcore,3ave79,Ghitre27,5,Wed Jun 24 00:43:54 2015 UTC,"This is another conceptual album. They put a lot of thought into it, and I think it works well.   The album is split into 4 chapters: ""Borealis"" (North), ""Austeralis"" (South), ""Zephyrus"" (West) and ""Eurus"" (East). Each track’s setting is a different city that geographically falls into that region, with real life recordings of each city incorporated into the songs   And here is what Shane Told said:   All the city clips we recorded, the transitions, and making sure the concept really worked and told this story of loneliness despite being surrounded by so much excitement. As much as I’ve put myself out there over all the records we’ve done, there’s something more real about this one. At times I almost stopped myself and said, is this going too far? Am I going to say something I’m going to regret? And after taking a step back and a few breaks from writing, I decided I needed to do this.   Source"
