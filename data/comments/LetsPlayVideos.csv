How old's your kid sister by the way? She doesn't sound all that young"

LetsPlayVideos,3dxavk,fuzzydice_82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:26 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I wasn't aware. Is that an unspoken rule?
LetsPlayVideos,3dxavk,fuzzydice_82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"somehow, yes. using celebrity names is a great way of getting sued and/or your channel taken down."
