JustEngaged,3dxw27,CandlelightingPanda,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! He was so sneaky about the proposal. It was hot and I was sweaty and we had reservations but he was dragging us all over the riverwalk (he admitted later he got lost trying to find the spot). I was on the verge of tears because I had thought maybe he would propose and had really gotten my hopes up, but when I asked him earlier to be honest he said he wasn't. Needless to say when he got down on one knee I started practically hyperventilating. I said yes of course and kissed him without realizing we had an audience until I heard clapping."
JustEngaged,3dudsd,wakapacman,38,Sun Jul 19 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"Most hospitals and clinics do not allow hand jewellery inorder to reduce the spread of infection, but also like your concern, it might be annoying if she has to constantly put gloves on and off.   I would say, just get her a ring that you think she would love, and a matching chain so that if she wanted to wear her engagement ring at work she could do so on the chain as a pendant."
JustEngaged,3dudsd,dandue,9,Sun Jul 19 16:16:34 2015 UTC,I think nurses and doctors are allowed to wear necklaces so this is the best option to have a pendant that you can easily hook your ring into for easy access after work.

JustEngaged,3dudsd,Veloziraptor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:00 2015 UTC,I'm a nurse and our hospital allows wedding bands and engagement rings. We did go with a low profile ring just so I could wear it with gloves. We got Krikawa's Carved Wave. My coworker got a gorgeous but very high set ring she can't wear at all to work. Some people can just flip them upside down before they put on gloves but hers just stabs through her gloves anyway unfortunately.
JustEngaged,3dudsd,CodenameSparklepants,13,Wed Jul 22 12:23:05 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm on the same boat! My girlfriend is an OB nurse, and she does not wear jewelry to work.  With that in mind, I just picked out the ring I think she'd love the most with no other considerations. She will not wear the ring while working and I think that's much preferable than rupturing gloves, or losing the ring from taking it off frequently throughout her shift!"
JustEngaged,3dudsd,LindeLou,8,Sun Jul 19 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a nurse and while it's technically not allowed many of my coworkers wear their wedding rings and other jewelry (ssssh, don't tell JCAHO). I don't both because I think it's gross and because it rips my gloves and generally gets in the way. When I am being that busy with my hands I don't want to worry about losing or damaging an expensive and sentimental piece of jewlery. I do have a very simple plain band with no engraving or stones (read: no divots for collecting gunk) that I sometimes wear at work as a placeholder and it was like $20 on Amazon. I would recommend just getting her a ring you think she'll love without worrying about work because really there is no nursing-friendly engagement ring.  I would, however, consider that many women prefer a lower setting simply because it snags less in daily life as well."
JustEngaged,3dudsd,merry_all_the_way,6,Sun Jul 19 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Does she wear other jewelry at work?  Some hospitals have policies against wearing rings because of infection control issues, so if I were you I would try to find out if she will be able to wear it at work.  If she is able to wear it at work then a low profile would probably be best,  but if she'll have to take it off anyway then go with what you'd think she'd prefer."
JustEngaged,3dudsd,Mmsm101,6,Sun Jul 19 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"Worked as a CNA at a nursing home. I was constantly pulling gloves on and off, and for a lot of places you can't even have fake nails, let alone wear hand jewelry.  So she may not be allowed to wear any ring regardless of style.  I would recommend trying to find out what the rules are at her work regarding jewelry on the floor, then work from there."
JustEngaged,3dudsd,pookaspingu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:06:13 2015 UTC,Get something that you think she might like. However maybe look at stone alternatives that might be cheaper since she won't be wearing it. My mum was a nurse and ended up wearing her ring on a necklace and eventually stopped wearing it. My cousin who is also recently got engaged had a beautiful moissanite ring that looked like a real diamond- no one could tell the difference! On top of that moissanite was less than half of the cost of same quality diamond rings.
JustEngaged,3dsfsl,corvus7corax,11,Sun Jul 19 00:36:29 2015 UTC,Pricescope is your one stop shop.

JustEngaged,3dsfsl,besttype,3,Sun Jul 19 12:18:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Pricescope is absolutely fabulous and the best place to go for diamond info.

Don't be rude and post about a different stone that no one asked about, it makes you look like an asshole."
JustEngaged,3dsfsl,turbodsm,-2,Sun Jul 19 11:48:56 2015 UTC,"I just don't like blanket statements. I'm sure you could find a diamond that has a warmer tone than a moissanite. You made it sound as that wasn't possible.   Seems the circle jerk is strong is this thread. I just came here from frugal which probably would love to hear about moissanite. And if you we ""justengaged"" its probably too late to get one."
JustEngaged,3dsfsl,rusrslythatdumb,2,Sun Jul 19 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you could find a moissanite more expensive than a diamond, but on the whole that's not true, is it?   I'm sure /r/frugal would love to hear about it, but you obviously realize that that isn't where you are. Even if you are ""just engaged"", there are people who aren't happy with their stone. Perhaps their SO tried to save money by buying a moissanite when what they really want is a diamond. It's still rude and snotty to comment on someone's post comparing apples to oranges. OP didn't ask for suggestions or advice. They were posting about saving money on a diamond, which is expensive to begin with. You could replace your original comment with ""a sapphire"" or ""an opal"" or ""a pebble"". All are less expensive than a diamond.  It's not circle jerk down voting, you're being down voted for the reason reddit intended; your comment isn't appropriate in this thread."
JustEngaged,3dsfsl,turbodsm,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"I posted because this is another thread was another facet of the diamond industry which people refuse to believe is a huge scam.

If you're so worried about it, maybe you should make your own thread instead of attempting to hijack someone else's. Or maybe don't view posts in a subreddit called /r/justengaged where there are very rarely posts about anything besides diamonds. Why are you even here?"

Have the invite comeback to your lady as a beach party to celebrate  ending of summer, then when you show up,  you can be all like, Bam! Lets get hitched!  Okay, the ending part isn't actually suggested. /u/yaimc already wrote the cute thing about having them hold up signs, so I had to delete my suggestion of the same thing.  Eitherway, proposals are beautiful and intimate things, that should be tailored to each couple. If your star trek fans, profess your love in klingon, and if she hits you, its a yes. If your kinda geeky, have a string of LED's planted in the sand in the shape of a heart, or a big diamond ring, or a tardis.  Or have each of her friends start giving her flowers to build up a little bouquet.  As a guy who is also planning on proposing next month, I think we both are over thinking things. We love our ladies, they either love us, or our pokemon teams, cause they are still with us. We aren't asking them to marry us, we are supposed to be ""proposing"" a new life, bound together by love and shiny round things.  Goodluck!"

JustEngaged,3dqbit,Jseiden12,21,Sat Jul 18 12:23:44 2015 UTC,I went through the same situation! I took mine to a well known jeweler in my area and they put 2 small dots of rhodium (or some kind of metal...I forgot which) on the inside of the band along the bottom. If you held the ring in your hand with the main diamond being 12 o'clock...the shots (small dots of that metal) were around the 4-5 o'clock and the 7-8 o'clock areas. These shots keep the ring from spinning! I found a great deal of improvement from this although my ring still spins (but it doesn't go completely upside down anymore). I thought the $95 price tag for the shots was worth it. And they are completely removeable in the future if/when we gain weight. :)

You then put your ring on sideways, as your knuckle is oval shaped, and then spin it round to the position you want it in. The pips will take some time to get used to, but they should grip your finger and keep it from spinning around.   Although it can be pricier than other options, it's really the most effective."

JustEngaged,3dalrz,TheDukesMistress,22,Tue Jul 21 21:10:50 2015 UTC,"I think it will help to think about what's giving you anxiety and making you feel impatient.   Are you worried that if it doesn't happen NOW it won't happen? You guys just moved in together! Enjoy getting to know each other on this new level.   Is it the wedding planning? Or dress shopping? Is it proving to your family or friends that you guys have solid relationship?   Whatever it is... is it really more important than your sanity?  That being said, you're hearing from the queen of anxious over-planning and preemptive worrying. I know it's not easy.  As for the ring, I think you guys should have a pretty frank conversation. Show him styles you like. Remind him that YOU will be the one wearing it for the rest of your life, but that you love him and trust his judgement (unless you don't... haha)  That being said, the ring doesn't have to be a surprise for the proposal to be a surprise. I've always thought that ""Will you marry me?"" is one of those questions that should never be asked unless you KNOW the answer.   My FH and I had lots of conversations about what marriage means, what we wanted out of a wedding day, and what we wanted out of a marriage. I also picked out the EXACT ring I wanted. And you know what, it went just fine!! :)  So, take a deep breath. Register for a class. Sign up for yoga. Go on a quilting retreat. Get your nails done. Look at pictures of adorable kittens online.  There are a lot of things you can do today and tomorrow and the next day even if he doesn't propose. Your life is full of happiness and potential. An engagement (and engagement ring) will just be icing on that cake."

Maybe lets check out a few rings. He was always for it, I just don't know think he knew where to start and was nervous I would say no.   He started casually looking at rings and I knew of a jeweler so I suggested we go. From there I picked out the diamond I wanted and told them what kind of setting I wanted them to make. So I had an idea what it would look like but never saw the final product.   I also knew when the ring was finished but the engagement would be a surprised so he held onto it for a little more than a month and we got engaged this past Sunday. I was very surprised as it seemed nothing was going right that day, I guess it was all part of the plan.

JustEngaged,3dalrz,Mustangbex,8,Tue Jul 14 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"My opinion might not be very popular, but here goes... you are planning on a life together. FOREVER. Communication and honesty are going to be two of the only things that get you through some of the stuff that may come your way- remember FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE- and in the best marriages, the worst still comes. So now, when things are amazing and you're full of love and hope and rainbows, is the time to practice your communication skills.   Talk with him. He might be trying to ply you into giving hints, or he may already have the ring- you two should have an idea of what your expectations are. Not just about when, but how much, what you like, what you picture, etc. If he's thinking he's got to compete with your brother's bestfriend's cousin's Uncle who rented out the a stadium and hired Bastille to sing a specially composed song in order to propose but you really just want private and personal, he should know that. If you LOVE diamonds, but hate solitaires, or you want pearls, or you have always dreamed of rose gold, he should know that. If you have always imagined a certain carat or stone size, but he has a $1500 budget, you two need to talk about it and find what will work best for your life together. If you're waiting waiting waiting but he's not sure yet or has concerns, YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. You're partners, you need to be able to talk to one another.   The ""romantic"" surprise engagement is a modern construct; before it was handled by parents, or community elders, or even later on by the couples, but it was something that people talked about at length. Don't worry, even after all this, his stomach will still be full of butterflies when he goes down on one knee and your heart will still skip a beat when he asks you to be his wife. I know- my fiance' and I had a great night laying in bed hashing it all out, and when he proposed, it was still beautiful, and romantic, and still overwhelms me with emotion to think on."

(Well not any moment.) But it's kind of like waiting to open gifts at Christmas - it is so exciting before! I don't know. I am interested to see what he will do. We've joked that the expensive dinner would be a dead giveaway that it was going to happen because my ideal date is generally pizza or barbeque so... yeah.

I also joke with him that the longer he waits, the higher the bar gets since he's been ""planning"" this for 10 months now (reality: he's procrastinated for 8 months and planned for 2), and more people are getting engaged in these elaborate manners.

It will happen when everything is right.  We had been talking about marriage for over a year (like every few weeks) by the time we got engaged. You need to make sure you are ready for it and have discussed all different kinds of questions in regards to finances [retirement, current, etc], savings [rainy day, vacations, etc], and how you will deal with bills once everything is joint, any debt you both have and how that will be paid off, kids (when you will have them, who will work, who will stay home if anyone, how they will be taken care of, how they will be raised [religiously or not, rules for the kids, parenting styles, etc]), living together in your own dwelling without parents, plans for the future [jobs, money, cars, schooling, etc], not just what kind of wedding you would have and everything else.   I'm not saying you haven't had these conversations. They won't always be comfortable and they may be hard to talk about but that's what marriage is. I'm just giving you another warning about having these discussions. It's good to have them frequently too (like once or twice a year) because people do change and opinions may change. I was once set on not having kids but now I'm looking forward to having children with my fiance.  I am only typing this wall of text because I know several couples that never had these discussions before getting engaged or married and are now divorced or broke up before the wedding that they had already started spending money on and I just want to try and help save another couple from potential heartbreak because of these issues."

JustEngaged,3cordf,wishforagiraffe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:36:07 2015 UTC,Custom jewelry can be surprisingly reasonably priced
JustEngaged,3cordf,MsBluffy,3,Fri Jul 10 12:32:15 2015 UTC,"This is especially true because your jeweler will get 100% of the profit (less expenses obviously). Let's say it costs Kirk Kara $700 to manufacture the ring. They still need to make a profit, so when you go to a jeweler and see the setting in his case, he may have purchased it from Kirk Kara for $1400. That means when said jeweler sells it to you for $2,400, he's only making $1,000.     When you ask a good jeweler to make a custom ring, it may still cost him $700, or even $1000 in expenses and labor, but he's raking in $1,400 when he sells it to you for $2,400. Final advice: look for local. Big chains don't do custom. Or if they do, there are so many middle men that the savings I mentioned won't make it to you. Deal with a jeweler that owns their own store, based in your community. Anyway that's my spiel. Good luck."

A good jeweler will also be able to do custom work, at almost any price range, which is generally out of the question with chain stores.

(Thankfully it was not an e-ring.) From the medical side they have a specific tool they could slip under and cut it off with no pain to me.  I'm assuming its the same thing the jeweler used.  Question though: I know a lot of places offer free resizing, but do they also include the cutting off then resizing?

The jeweler used a cool little hand crank rotary cutter that made a perfectly clean cut. She would have included the cut in the resizing fee but their turnaround time was two weeks and we're traveling, so that wouldn't work. Instead she just charged us $10, which I thought was pretty fair! I'll be getting it fixed at our next stop. :)"

JustEngaged,3c4qgl,Setsukilove1,11,Sat Jul 4 19:39:48 2015 UTC,I care far more about clarity and cut than the size of the ring. I would prefer a smaller more brilliant stone in a cool setting than a giant less brilliant one.
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,bart_burgers,5,Sat Jul 4 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is something any of us can answer for you. What do YOU find important? Do you like bigger diamonds (or whatever type of stone you choose)? Do you like elaborate settings? Do you like rings that sparkle? Is there a particular cut you prefer?   I personally like medium sized diamonds, so not giant 4 carat ones, but something above .5 carats. I like round brilliant cuts because of the way they sparkle, but I also want my ring to have a bit more personality than a plain setting. People around me have been getting engaged left and right, and I think they're all gorgeous. But some of them just aren't for me, whereas they're perfect for them. Start with a cut you like, the figure out how complex of a setting you want, and then work up from there."
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,stormeegedon,2,Sat Jul 4 23:31:51 2015 UTC,I was more just curious on what everyone's opinion is on this.  I like medium with antique setting and want a blue stone.
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,stormeegedon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"Those are all really good starts! You might want to pick a couple different settings you like and talk to a jeweler about stones. Some are softer than others and may not work with the settings. Or vice versa, you could pick the stone you like the best and get a setting that fits it best. I'm not well versed in how to judge quality of stones, but that's where a good jeweler comes in! Find someone who is willing to walk you through each step and get you want you really want."
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,iHmS81023,3,Mon Jul 6 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"I like the wow factor. My husband and I upgraded the diamond in my ring last year. It was our 10yr anniversary and went from a .56 flawless round to a 1.26ct vvs1. Try not to buy it online. Take the design you like and go to a local jeweler. No matter what stone you choose, you'll get a nicer stone at a better price. The shop we go to has been around for 100yrs in the same location and are highly regarded. Amazingly the prices are awesome.  When going to a local jeweler they will wow you within your price range."
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,Turns2Foam320,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I think its very personal. But for me, I would rather have a smaller stone with less inclusions. Rather than one that is larger and discolored or cloudy."
JustEngaged,3c4qgl,m0llywobbles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"I knew I never wanted to ""upgrade"" my ring--the one that my fiance proposed with has a heavy amount of significance to me. Being able to withstand a reasonable amount of daily wear matters more to me than being flashy, and it worked out nicely that the family ring he wanted to propose with was one that matched what I wanted exactly. It's such a big personal decision, though, that I can understand every side of it."

JustEngaged,3azv53,ppcrack646,2,Wed Jun 24 23:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy it worked out, actually your bad experience (with the minie) lead me to choosing a different designer for my ring as well, since originally I wanted one of her other rings and decided for the money it wasn't worth the risk. I actually follow the designer on instagram and she (at least I believe it was the same ring) was trying to sell your old ring last week and you could definitely see the crooked bezel and unevenness. You made a smart choice that ring you have there is beautiful!!"
JustEngaged,3azv53,ppcrack646,3,Wed Jun 24 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"Oh man! The photos she posts are flawless, so maybe I just got unlucky. Still, I would hate for someone else to have to deal with all of that. And yes, I still follow her Instagram and it was definitely my ring she was selling. It sucked dealing with it but I'm so much happier with the ring I have now. What ring did you end up getting? I would love to see it!"

JustEngaged,3az1cv,LMBiebs,3,Wed Jun 24 18:26:44 2015 UTC,"My ring is from Brilliant Earth. It's not lab created, it's from Canada. Sorry that's not more helpful, but I do really recommend the company. The sales people were very helpful and my fianc√© said they didn't work off of commission so they weren't pushy or anything and were very friendly. They even sent him lots of pictures with different stones in the setting so he could choose exactly the one he wanted."
JustEngaged,3az1cv,TourmalineTart,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:56 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I've had my diamond appraised by a local jeweler, but I CAN say that my ring is the most f***ing gorgeous thing I've ever owned in my life.  I had no idea diamonds could sparkle so many colors! Here's a link to my post right after my SO proposed, the specs of the diamond are in the comments.  I say GO FOR IT!"
JustEngaged,3az1cv,orangebluegreenred,2,Wed Jun 24 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a geologist (not a gemologist, but I know a thing or 2 about gemstones.) We have a gemstone and faceting lab at my university, and several of the most beautiful gemstones I have ever seen were lab created.    Also, if you're willing to go lab created, check out Amora Gem.  It is freaking stunning--like seriously, I have no words to describe it."
JustEngaged,3az1cv,pacificplayland,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"My FH and I had a great experience with Brilliant Earth, especially because we were able to go into a showroom (Beverly Hills, the other is in San Francisco I think) and compare diamonds, sapphires, and moissanites ourselves. I don't know if we compared lab created and natural ethical diamonds, but I really doubt a layman can tell the difference. We didn't use a loupe, though I wish I still had mine from geology classes, ha :) The only obvious differences we saw were the sparkle (""fire"") and temperature (warm/cool leaning).  The center stone is an enhanced moissanite and the side stones are ethical (non-lab) diamonds from Brilliant Earth. There is a slight temperature/color difference that is only noticeable in certain lighting (and some of these indoor pictures).

Keep in mind though, that these are rings that you'll be wearing forever, so it has to work with your style.

My husband and I do not have matching rings. I have platinum for mine (gold allergy), but we found that platinum, and even white gold, did nothing for him. So his ring is dark titanium and rose gold.

I would get this for your wedding day and then save the dream topaz ring for another time (5 or 10 yr anniversary? Push gift if you have a baby?)  I have a band that coordinates, but does not match exactly, my E-ring. There is something so lovely & symbolic about having the set. It shows people I'm married(!) and not just engaged. From this perspective, I prefer the raw diamond band. But that's just my opinion - you do what you think will make you happiest! After all, you are the one who has to wear it every day!"

Maybe a special pendant or bracelet? Something that would be special but not take away from your ring.

So I ended up getting a tinsel cut wedding band. My set is from etsy.   Also I feel like you should go with your dream ring. My dream ring was a raw diamond, because I think my husband would have done something emerald,  but I love the organic look of a raw diamond.   You're going to wear it forever right?

JustEngaged,36mg73,anorlien,13,Wed May 20 13:38:14 2015 UTC,You can get a sizing bead put in. It doesn't matter how the ring is structured because it's just a little bead that goes inside the ring and can be taken out after you resize. Here's an example of what that might look like.
JustEngaged,36mg73,rissm,4,Wed May 20 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"My friend has sizing beads on her engagement ring - had them for as long as she's been married (9 years?), doesn't bother her in the least.  I personally find that my fingers kind of... adapt to new rings and tuck in a bit more than my other fingers. It's been happening my whole life, and doesn't really have anything to do with weight loss or anything. I don't know why it happens, it just does. Maybe it's similar for you?"

I have had the same piece tied on since the weekend after our engagement, so roughly 2 months, and still going strong! Plus, the cord is purple and that's my favorite color, haha. The only real downside is the you have to scrub it (the cord) a little extra when you wash your hands, or else the soap/bubbles tend to stick around."

You can get it in earthy colors, or they sell dyed colors (like I've been using, and the color hasn't bled or anything). Mine came in a package of maybe 8 colors, maybe 10 feet of each? It wasn't expensive, and it's good for crafting!"
JustEngaged,36mg73,kimbeary,3,Thu May 21 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"Amazon carries DipSize. One of my best friends had to wait until September to get her ring sized, so I bought her a tub.

JustEngaged,36c8tu,OhSoTheYIsSilent,37,Mon May 18 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"Take it back to the man you bought it from and have him fix it. He's human, and mistakes happen - it's not necessarily his fault the stone is loose, but he is the best one to fix the setting before you lose the stone entirely. A loose stone is not being nit picky! It's being careful and watchful of an expensive and significant part of your life. Don't be embarrassed for taking care of your ring."

JustEngaged,36c8tu,Ryslin,4,Mon May 18 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"As a man, I wouldn't be offended if you brought it back to me, as long as you didn't emphasize any ""shoddy craftmanship."" In fact, I'd probably be more upset if the diamond fell out and you had noticed it was loose. I'd recommend saying something like ""Hey, I think this diamond may be a little loose. What do you think? I just want to make sure that I don't lose it.""  This way, you let him make the call (you already know it's loose, but he'll feel less guilty if you don't force it on him), and you move the attention away from the craftsmanship, and toward the sentimental value that it has for you.  Of course, I'm sure most men will be fine with. ""Hey, I think this is loose. Will you take a look?"" But, you seem nervous about this, so better to be safe! =o)"

JustEngaged,36c8tu,stormeegedon,2,Mon May 18 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"That ring sounds absolutely gorgeous and I hope you post it soon!  But definitely take it to the jeweler. Prongs are a finicky thing and are the number 1 reason stones are lost. If it is already loose, keep it locked up tight in the box and take it back asap to have him fix it. That ring is a work of art to that man, and he would be just as devastated to learn that the center stone fell out as you would!"

JustEngaged,35f623,1newworldorder,-1,Fri May 15 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"the ring is out of our rather meager budget   Im close to question day...ive got her finger size and i know what she likes, but i just cant seem to make enough money to get her the dream ring.  Enter: moissanite!  Its about 1/5 the price of diamond. It has many similar properties of diamond. If you research it on wikipedia, you will learn it isnt as hard as diamond (moissanite is a 9.5 just above ruby on the hardness scale), but it is rated as being more ""fiery""  (imagine shinyness). Read what other people have to say about them, these babies are the real deal. Nobody will be able to tell that its not a diamond.  You also have the added benefit of knowing that none of these precious stones were harvested by a  ____________ (ill let you fill in the blank) since most of the moissanite in society is made in a lab. My concious is clear.  Best of luck."

JustEngaged,3511i7,kryrinn,1 point,Wed May 6 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"I second going to a jeweler. I prefer independent businesses over chains. They're more inclined to work in your price range, do special orders, or even custom make a setting (again in any price range). In my experience the chain jewelers will just try to shove something down your throat and charge you a bunch of money. If you haven't bought the stone yet, I would also recommend going to a jeweler for this. They can bring stones in, explain the cuts, and show you a variety of stones in person. That way you're not buying sight unseen. A lot of people have had great experiences online, but personally I wouldn't trade a good relationship with a well educated jeweler for anything."
JustEngaged,3511i7,MsBluffy,4,Fri May 8 19:32:47 2015 UTC,You can go for this store http://www.diamondere.com/d/jewelry/engagement-rings

JustEngaged,3511i7,salt_and_linen,3,Wed May 6 18:03:16 2015 UTC,Any jewelry store will do this. The stones in store displays are generally CZ stand ins - typically the stone and setting are purchased separately. They'll also have equivalent sized stones so you can get an idea of what it would look like.
JustEngaged,3511i7,SwtSthrnBelle,2,Wed May 6 19:54:39 2015 UTC,Stuller. I picked out my semi-mount from them. They have a product finder to locate nearby jewelers who sell/work with them.

Usually the advice is to upgrade the side stones/melee to get sparkling sets. I've done quite a bit of research on them and a lot of people like them for the price/quality ratio (pricescope site in particular uses them a lot - they also have a sticky in the coloured section forum with other setting sellers).

JustEngaged,3503u5,vespria,2,Fri May 15 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"You can get mystic topaz that is also a nice orange/pink sort of thing. However, mystic topaz is not the best stone to have as a forever type of ring to wear everyday because it is heat treated and can become damaged. I can't remember the specifics, but it is definitely something to look into.   Concave cut gems are very unique and beautiful, and you can get ones that are more durable, like sapphire, cut that way. I'll try to get some examples with stones that are similar colours as a mustic topaz."
JustEngaged,3503u5,shayfoxx,4,Sat May 9 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"Topaz is a nice idea, but keep in mind, it will need a protective setting, so it doesn't cleave when struck. I would recommend reading up on a few different stones and their suitability in regards to daily wear (take into account hardness AND toughness). Here is a website I frequent, and their information in mystic topaz. If she likes mood rings, perhaps consider alexandrite. Alexandrite actually changes colors entirely depending on the light it is exposed to. I'm not sure what your budget is, but considering how expensive natural stones are, I would consider lab grown. Lab grown alexandrites are chemically identical to a mined stone, but can be bought for much cheaper, in larger sizes, and more vivid and pure color saturation. They typically changes from bluish green in natural light, to purple and raspberry red in incandescent and candle light, more info here. Plus it is very suitable for every day wear. Here is a reliable site to purchase them."

JustEngaged,3503u5,BeardedBlacksmith,1 point,Wed May 6 07:52:40 2015 UTC,"I would propose with a mystic topaz, and if she feels like it's too soft a stone, or wants a different look, incorporate the mystic topaz into an eternity ring or something like that, so she can have both the ring/stone you proposed with and the exact engagement ring that she wants.   Edit: while I'm sure that sounds like a lot, if you keep the eternity a simple metal, like stainless steel, that would keep the cost down.  I have a friend who majored in geology, and if you go to a local gemologist you'll get a higher quality stone for a lower price, than going to say, Kay's or Riddle's."

JustEngaged,34op0k,carriedaway2,11,Sun May 3 03:08:29 2015 UTC,"Hi. I work at a jewelry store and earlier this week I ordered a Moissanite and a Diamond Hybrid so I could compare them for a customer. To me the hybrid looked more like a diamond and was clearer than the moissanite. Both are hand cut by a diamond cutter which helps them look more natural but the biggest difference is a moissanite is a type of polymer but a hybrid is 85% lab created diamond with only a tiny portion of it not being molecularly identical to a real diamond. I also found the hybrid to be a little less expensive. If I were you I would go with a hybrid diamond. They are sold commercially through Mia Donna. Hope this helps :)  Edit: also I probably shouldn't be telling all of reddit this because my mom would probably kill me but she actually has a 2.5 carat diamond hybrid in her engagement ring. It's over 10 years old and still looks amazing. The technology has changed a bit since then so I compared a new one to hers and it looks slightly better, but I still can't tell hers isn't a natural diamond."

JustEngaged,34op0k,Anangel84,1 point,Sun May 3 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would try to go to a brick and mortar store to see moissanite in person. There aren't a lot of places in my area that do sell moissanite but I do think it's worth it to see it offline.   If you look around this sub and the weddingbee ring boards there lots of examples of moissanite and morganite. Here's one of the moissaniteco threads and a morganite thread. You might also want to pay attention to what kind of moissanite was used - unenhanced, amora, etc.   I had actually considered white sapphire myself but was told that it can get ""cloudy"" - not sure how true this is, but in the end decided not to that route. I had also considered other diamond simulants like amora or asha, not sure if you'd be interested in those.   Good luck searching around!   More moissanite threads: 1 2 3 4"
JustEngaged,34op0k,rissm,2,Sun May 3 03:48:56 2015 UTC,Aww thank you that's exactly what I was looking for!! Just out of curiosity what did you end up going with?
JustEngaged,34op0k,rissm,3,Sun May 3 04:13:42 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm actually still thinking about it but I went looking at some antique and consignment jewelry. I didn't want to get a diamond originally at all because of ethical concerns but felt that antique would help ease some of those concerns for me. Diamonds also don't hold their value well so I thought I could also find something I liked with a budget exactly the same as yours. I fell in love with a warmer yellow coloured diamond there and I think I want to go with that. It's funny because originally I was looking at what grades of moissanite would be as colourless as possible but I love the warm colour of the diamond and how it looks with my skin and contrasts with the cool colour of the white gold. To me, it has a lot of character.   Oh and just to note I was told by two different brick and mortar jewellers that they could order moissanite for $500-600 per carat so it is a really good deal!"
JustEngaged,34op0k,_Discard_Account_,2,Sun May 3 04:23:31 2015 UTC,"I got my half-carat moissanite for under $100 from the actual company that makes them. If you're willing to buy from other websites that order in bulk from the creator company, you can get an even better deal. I've seen them as low as $82 for a half-carat classic Charles & Colvard moissanite. And you can return them for a full refund after 14-30 days, depending on the seller, so you're not stuck with the stone if you end up not liking it. Do not buy from a retailer unless you're willing to pay an inflated price or unless they agree to match the online price+shipping. Most jewelers will be happy to set a stone that you order yourself and bring in to them.   P.S. I just checked. Charles & Colvard sells individual round-cut 1-carat classic moissanites directly to consumers online for $179, and 1-carat Forever Brilliant moissanites for $399. Other places can offer even better deals. $500-$600 per carat is not a good deal if you're looking for the best price. Just so you're aware."

My ring was custom made, so the jeweler recommended a Forever Brilliant moissanite and I love it. For 1.2ct it ran about $1200 for the stone, which is a fraction of the cost of a similar diamond.

JustEngaged,34op0k,_Discard_Account_,2,Sun May 3 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"The stone itself cost $1200, or was that including the setting?

Since they own both companies,  they said they'd be happy to upgrade me to the moissanite down the road for only the cost of the stone! The Asha is more clear than Moissanite,  but the Moissanite is a tiny bit harder than the Asha,  so I might upgrade later.

No problems. The ordering process was totally easy,  they were prompt to respond. It too a bit longer than they normally quote,  but that's because we ordered it during the horrible East coast blizzards so everything got delayed a little.

JustEngaged,34op0k,Amanpreeetkaur,1 point,Tue May 5 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I picked out my ring together (today!!)! Because of ethical reasons, we both didn't want a diamond. We went to the cutest little jewelry shop and the jeweler just happened to have a moissanite in the size we wanted handy. He brought it and a diamond out, and we literally could not tell a difference, even he couldn't, and even one type of diamond checking weird machiney thingy couldn't!! It is absolutely beautiful!!! We were thinking of ordering something off of moissaniteco.com, but weren't comfortable with ordering online for something so precious. Also, it made us nervous that we couldn't verify the quality and everything before we got it. The jeweler we went to used the amazingly high quality moissanite to create the exact ring we wanted off of moissaniteco (with a few tweaks to make it PERFECT) and it wasn't that much more expensive than the online. To us, it was completely worth the extra couple hundo to have it uniquely made for us, with high quality moissanite especially since some of them can turn yellow/green/greyish if they aren't made right. I would suggest doing some research about little family owned shops in your area to see if they can do something custom for you, with you involved in every step of the process :) Good luck and congratulations!!   Edit: The jewelery shop also gave us a lifetime warranty with free sizing and cleaning forever, so that's a plus. I will never go to a 'chain' jeweler again. The small, family owned jewelers are where it's at!"

I didn't want a diamond for the ethical reasons (and the lower price is a bonus!) and I'm happy with what we picked. I got a forever brilliant, and 99% of the time it looks clear - and boy, does it ever sparkle in the sunlight lol.

JustEngaged,340qdy,miss_misery83,12,Mon Apr 27 11:42:23 2015 UTC,Ring sleeve/ring snuggie! They're little rubber knobs that slide onto the band after you get the ring past your knuckle to tighten it up and stop it from spinning. In the US they cost like $6 on amazon.
JustEngaged,340qdy,adrun,7,Mon Apr 27 13:10:07 2015 UTC,"Some of the reviews for that product recommend just buying your own tubing and cutting it to the right width. A lot cheaper and you can get a flexible tubing rather than the hard PVC they use (which reviews say can get uncomfortable). You had the same idea as me though, I had just forgotten what they're called :)"

JustEngaged,340qdy,vespria,6,Tue Apr 28 10:58:45 2015 UTC,"Have a jeweler put sizing beads in the band to help with the knuckle issue. Also have him try on some different styles (thickness can make a huge difference) to see what he feels most comfortable with. Have fun with it! I took my FI to Jewelers to test out styles, and it was hilarious to see the looks on the sales associates faces when they realized we were there for him, and not me. Write everything down that you learn about what he has a preference towards. My FI broke his finger in high school, and was sad that ""all rings"" made his broken finger look chubby. It took 7 shops, and a few cheap rings (in the $10 range) that we ordered to test, to find something that he liked. He ended up discovering that a comfort fit looked and felt far better than all of the rest. Now he's super excited about it! Just approach it from the standpoint that there is a good ring out there for him; he just hasn't tried enough options yet."
JustEngaged,340qdy,Dutchy85,2,Mon Apr 27 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, comfort fit has already been settled on, both because of comfort for wear on the finger should he do so, but also because he feels it will ""glide"" easier on the chain if he wears it around his neck.  I stumbled across a small, family-owned jeweller that does custom work in-shop and with several decades of experience. My boyfriend is so excited about it now because he can bring drawings of his ideas into the shop. It's fun to see him so excited about this. Your suggestions are great and that link I will print out and bring with us when we go in for our orders. Thank you!  And I'm very happy your FI found the fit for him! I never thought I'd feel so strongly about a piece of jewellery, but I suppose if anyone understands, it's the people in this sub. :D"

JustEngaged,33vjfw,salt_and_linen,0,Sun Apr 26 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"So they were happy tears? Cool. I was wondering if people cried because maybe they were thinking about all their previous relationships that didn't work out that kind of led them to the one that did and so they felt overwhelmed with a thought like ""So this is what it was all for.

(Kristen Bell does the same thing, there's a clip of her on Ellen receiving her birthday present that's hysterical and worth watching.

Here's how he proposed: he told me that we were going to an early dinner at a fancy restaurant that I hadn't been to before. He got a nice car to pick us up and he said we were making a stop first. We went to the Lincoln Memorial, which was great and surprisingly not that crazy because I'm a big nerd and I love Lincoln and we've been doing a bunch of Lincoln related things lately because of the big 150th anniversary. Anyway, we toured around the monument and walked around a little, and then he pulled me off to the side where there weren't any tourists around and it was quiet with a great view of the Mall and the city. There he made this really sweet speech about us and how timeless our love is. The. He got down on one knee and proposed! It was so sweet and amazing and I couldn't stop crying, I was too excited and a mess that I forgot to actually put on my ring! Then he pointed out the photographer he had hired who had taken pictures of everything, and we walked around and took more pictures. Then he told me that dinner wasn't for a few more hours and he had a limo waiting with a couple of bottles of champagne and a box of chocolates to take us around the city while the sunset so we could ride around and call all our friends and family. It was awesome! Then we finally did go to dinner :)"

She pretended she was doing a piece on the Christmas Village and wanted to take our picture under the LOVE statute. She took a few and then he moved and pulled out the ring!

When I first started dating him, he and his friend had just returned from Iceland for a gaming convention (as we're both pretty nerdy). Over the years, I began going along with him.  So March 2015, it is my 3rd trip to Iceland, and his 4th. We were accompanied by some mutual friends. We were on a tour bus to venture the ""Golden Circle"" (to see the national park, geysers, and waterfall). Gullfoss -- the waterfall -- being my favorite. Well, we got lucky and it was the last stop.  He proposed to me in front of tourists and friends alike, where his friends could capture a few photos. It was freezing and super windy so you can't hear anything on the video, but still nice to have.  Funny story is that his parents knew he was proposing before hand -- the ring he proposed with he made by hand with the help of his family. Story here. So, his dad contacted the head-honchos of the gaming convention, and somehow got our proposal photo added to the closing ceremony in front of our 2,000-3,000 fellow nerds. We had a reddit thank you for how awesome it was. We ended up picking out a diamond ring before we even left for Iceland, so I had no idea that he was going to propose. Here's a picture of both rings."

JustEngaged,33j0us,squishmi,2,Thu Apr 23 02:03:21 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! My fianc√©e designed it himself.
JustEngaged,33j0us,insanelycrazyoo,3,Thu Apr 23 02:54:18 2015 UTC,What a very interesting and unique ring! I've never seen one just like it! What kind of wedding band do you think you will go with? :)  Congratulations on your engagement!
JustEngaged,33ji4o,laydaypray,13,Thu Apr 23 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"For some people, a simple solitaire is 100% true to their personality! Timeless, classic, and emblematic may be the words they aspire to in their sense of style. For me it's more like grounded, clean lines, and everyday elegance. Try to think of the words that would describe your ideal fashion/style/personal image and then look for a ring that fits that."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,adrun,7,Thu Apr 23 02:09:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I like to indulge in ""fads"" in small ways, but my wardrobe, my hair, my nails, everything about me is simple. I hate looking back on photos and thinking ""oh god, you can tell it was the 90's"" etc. So many I do need to go with a solitaire !"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,imrightorlying,9,Thu Apr 23 05:04:54 2015 UTC,I saw someone with a three stone ring where the middle was diamond and the side stones were blue sapphire and I just loved it. So when I was looking at rings that's the style I ended up coming back to. We ended up getting a center diamond from my FH's mom so that narrowed it down because of the shape. I just keep browsing online until I saw the perfect setting. Now there are other styles I like and would have been happy with but I also know that because my style is relatively classic I'll be happy with it forever.   pic for reference.
JustEngaged,33ji4o,salt_and_linen,9,Thu Apr 23 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"There does exist a middle ground!  My ring is a simple solitaire, but in a bezel setting that has a lot of milgrain work, and the stone is round and colored. A bit of both worlds. I work with my hands a lot, so I wanted a low-profile, secure setting for the stone. I hadn't planned on a bezel setting, but when I tried it on I was thunderstruck. It was the only one I kept coming back to.  We settled on a yellow sapphire because yellow is my favorite color :) My SO liked the idea - he likes the warmth of the stone.  Here are a couple photos - the color of the stone is more 'true' in the second image, the first was just to pick out the detail work."

JustEngaged,33ji4o,shesurrenders,6,Tue May 5 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"I knew I wanted white diamonds, and I knew I wanted them to be lab created. Since there are only like 2 companies that make actual lab created diamonds, that narrowed it down a lot! But it still took a good month to pick the perfect one. I have never regretted it though, it's 100% me."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,shesurrenders,2,Thu Apr 23 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"A month, you are amazing! I wish I could be that decisive. I am also looking at lab created diamonds,that or moiss."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,attacktheblock,2,Thu Apr 23 05:09:31 2015 UTC,"Haha well I also knew I wanted a side diamond like I ended up getting and I narrowed it down to Gemesis (now called Pure Grown Diamonds I think) as the company, so I was really only picking between like 6 rings or something!! Ridiculous."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,carrotsabound,6,Thu Apr 23 05:21:00 2015 UTC,"I went through the same thing. My boyfriend and I discussed getting married and it was important to him that I get a say in my ring design. I had the same indecisiveness you describe. I ended up making a private Pinterest board of engagement ring settings I liked. Initially I thought I would want a simple setting for an oval diamond because I wanted something different and everyone I knew had round stones.   So I started populating my board and finally, as I was looking over it one day, I realized that nearly every ring I had put on there looked very similar. Round stone, halo of colored gems, antique-style setting. So I figured that there must be a reason why I kept coming back to the same design. We went to a family jeweler that my boyfriend's family adores and gave them some of my inspiration photos. It's been about 1.5 months now, so I am definitely getting excited!   Anyway, like a lot of the other people have said here - just go with what you like. If it takes a Pinterest board to discover the pattern - then go for it. No need to steer away from solitaires! I knew a solitaire wasn't for me, but I have plenty of friends who have them and it couldn't look more gorgeous."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,wishforagiraffe,6,Thu Apr 23 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"I always knew that I wanted a diamond. I love the sparkle and I love that they just go with everything and honestly I just wanted the symbolism of the diamond engagement ring, I had tried on a ton of rings over several months just to get an idea of what shapes and styles I liked. I spent a ton of time browsing antique jewelry on Esty.   It was amazing to me how some styles that I loved looked bad on my finger but others I hadn't considered looked phenomenal. After figuring out what I liked actually on my body helped me to have an idea of what to tell my boyfriend as far as shape/style. In the end he picked the perfect for me ring that fit all my wishes--antique, wide setting that fit the scale of my finger, and something with a low profile."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,carrotsabound,4,Thu Apr 23 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"My FH and I had been talking about getting engaged for a long time, and I had a ring that my dad had made for my mom for their 1 year anniversary, so I suggested we use that ring as my engagement ring when we got engaged. He loved the idea, we got officially engaged about 2 seconds after that, and had the ring reworked by a jeweler shortly after.  I knew I didn't want a diamond (the ring had a white topaz in the centre and a sapphire halo), and I love the vintage look and feeling if the ring (plus my mom found the white topaz while scuba diving around a Portuguese shipwreck off the coast of Nova Scotia, which makes it extra cool - booty ring!).  I would have gone for something super similar even if I didn't have that ring. It's my style, unique and a bit vintage, classic, and crazy sentimental, lol."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,y0urbabysmama,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:41:36 2015 UTC,"Dang, that is such a cool story about finding the topaz!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,kelly52182,6,Thu Apr 23 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"I've long known that my parents are WAY cooler than I'll ever be - my dad was a race car driver when they started dating, and she was all: ""hey, I'll give that a shot, too!"" Romantic adventurers. They're the best. She was a scuba diver in the late '70s, before she met my dad (the only lady on a scuba crew of 5 or 6)."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,_Discard_Account_,3,Fri Apr 24 01:19:54 2015 UTC,"I struggled with my engagement ring because there are so many different styles! I have to admit, before we got the ring, I went to websites and designed a ring I would want. I did so many different styles and see which one I'd like. I went to a few jewelry stores and tried on different styles to see which complimented my finger better. It definitely took a while but I think once you try a variety, you see one setting and style you absolutely fall in love with and go with it! I think a lot of people go with diamonds or cz, or moissanite or any white stone because it just looks simple and clean (that was my personal reasoning for why I picked white sapphire). I have a three stone sapphire with diamonds on the band, love it and it wasn't so expensive. I also love three stone engagement rings. But this is again, why you should go with your fiance to a jeweler and try on a bunch of different styles!!!! Also, it's super exciting and fun. And you might find something that you didn't think you'd ever like or find appealing!   Sorry this was so long lol! Good luck!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,kelly52182,5,Thu Apr 23 02:10:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying! Ive tried on a ton, and I fell in love with solitaire but I am always worried I'll have regrets. But I guess if you are drawn to one, then that's what you should stick with!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,_Discard_Account_,3,Thu Apr 23 05:08:05 2015 UTC,I decided on a morganite ring with a diamond halo in rose gold (the stone doesn't look as pink in the picture as it actually is).  I knew I didn't want a diamond as the main stone because it just wasn't me.  I had looked at sapphires and some topaz rings but morganite really stuck out.  It's different but not too off the wall (like me!).  A lot of people in my family said it fit my personality perfectly.  I tried on lots of different rings and done a ton of searching before I found the one that was perfect.  We actually got mine from this Etsy shop and they have fantastic service.  It definitely takes time to find one that you know you'll be happy with for the rest of your life.  That's part of the reason why I chose one that was simple.  I didn't want to have something that looked like it was a fad from 20 years ago.  You'll find one that you love and it'll be perfect :)  Good luck!!
JustEngaged,33ji4o,kelly52182,3,Thu Apr 23 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"I browse the jewelry subs every once in a while, and this is the first time I've seen someone with an engagement ring from the same seller on Etsy as mine! I could tell as soon as I saw your ring that it was extremely similar to mine... even though mine is moissanite, round brilliant cut, and set in white gold. So it's a little more traditional-looking, but I love the uniqueness of yours, too!   It was surprisingly difficult to find something that both looked good AND didn't have stones in the shank (my fianc√© let me choose exactly what I wanted). I didn't get the matching wedding band, though, because I figured I might end up preferring something more intricate to contrast with the plain shank of the engagement ring. What did you do, if you don't mind saying?"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,usb_donglegoblin,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"That's amazing!  I never thought I'd find someone that used the same shop either!  And thank you :)  My fiance let me pick mine too, he said he didn't want to pick something and have me not like it.  I didn't get the matching wedding band either.  I just got a small, plain rose gold band and I really love it.  I didn't want anything fancy.  I sometimes just wear my band without the engagement ring because the setting and band are both pretty thin and I'm terrified of breaking it.  I think something more intricate would look really pretty with it though.  It would look great with the halo setting!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,CodenameSparklepants,3,Thu Apr 23 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a little wary of accidentally breaking or losing my ring, as well, but since it's not an expensive diamond, it won't be such a big deal if that ever happens, anyway! I've worn another, much thinner, gold ring for over 15 years, and nothing's happened to it except getting the tiniest bit bent - and that's with me never taking it off even for rougher activities. When I first saw my engagement ring in person, I thought it was actually really thick and sturdy-looking in comparison - so I think we're pretty safe in that regard!   You're right that this Etsy store has great customer service - if anyone else is reading this and looking for a ring, I definitely recommend Gene. He was willing to set a stone that we bought separately and shipped to him in New York. Since we got a great deal on the moissanite and he gave us a discount for not having to source the stone himself, the ring only cost ~$430 in total (including the stone)... which is still a bit much to me personally, but it was a great price compared to most other sellers, for sure!  I'm probably going to go to a jewelry store and try on a bunch of different wedding bands to see what looks best with it. Definitely something simple, to keep the focus on the gorgeous halo setting! Also, I haven't cleaned my ring in ages so it's a bit on the dull side now, but here's a photo of it anyway if you're curious. :)"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,bostonkreamdonut,2,Thu Apr 23 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"I WAS curious, that's beautiful!  An intricate band would look really great with that setting.  Best of luck to you!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,weddingbee124,3,Thu Apr 23 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"My husband and I picked out my engagement ring together. We looked at rings about six months before he popped the question, and then after the proposal we went back and picked out ""the"" ring. I tried on a ton of different styles, knowing in the back of my mind that I wanted something antique/vintage. We eventually found the perfect ring, and I love wearing it every day! It's a little unique looking, and I get compliments on it often.   That being said, I often see simple solitaires that I think look absolutely lovely. That type of style is always timeless and classic. It all depends on what makes you feel happiest!"
JustEngaged,33ji4o,OhSoTheYIsSilent,3,Thu Apr 23 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"I actually picked out a top 3 with FH (and found that it's definitely true that it's different on your hand than online or in the case!) and then left it up to him. They were three fairly different styles, but with common elements (eg all yellow gold). He picked one and proposed, and I love it to death because he picked it and then asked me to spend forever with him. I would have loved any one of them even though they were really different. I don't think there's just one ""The Ring"" out there for people or that I need to search endlessly for the perfect one. The ring that fits you 100% is one you like, and that carries the amazing meaning of the proposal."
JustEngaged,33ji4o,bitxilore,3,Fri Apr 24 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"I wanted a solitaire but also wanted a cool band that wasn't too flashy, so this is what my finance picked out for me: pic.  You could totally still get the solitaire AND get something that fits your personality :)"

JustEngaged,33ct9m,CouldBeBunnies,16,Tue Apr 21 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"I know someone who actually got half off their ring because the couple had discussed sort of a unique idea that he ordered it out his girlfriend knowing. She and a friend were walking by the jewelers counter and she was telling her friend about this dream ring and the salesgirl went, ""Oh, you must be John's fianc√©!""  Which she wasn't yet. So the manager got a pretty irate visit from boyfriend, and the surprise was ruined but they got a slamming deal.  I'm sorry though. That really does suck. As someone who wanted a surprise and didn't really get it, I can promise it will still be so special."
JustEngaged,33ct9m,CodenameSparklepants,7,Wed Apr 22 03:25:01 2015 UTC,"Social media faux pas. That's terrible. If he'd been designing something new for his store, sure, post the rendering, but when you're designing something FOR someone, you absolutely cannot publish it before it has been picked up. Dumb move on the part of the jeweler. I'm so sorry some element of the surprise was ruined."
JustEngaged,33ct9m,carrotsabound,5,Thu Apr 23 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"I know that it will still be amazing when it is actually mine, and seeing it in the flesh! I guess preserving the element of surprise was just something I had been going out of my way to do, and I had some of that taken from me. I know now which stone he chose as well as some other design elements that I'm trying to forget but they're ingrained! It won't take away from the moment at all, like I said just a frustration I wanted to vent about."
JustEngaged,33ct9m,backl_ash,6,Tue Apr 21 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"The same thing happened to me, but it wasn't complete, so I wasn't that upset. He made a link on his page for my fiance to go and pay for the finished product that autoposted to his fb page like ""Latest edition to store"". The photos in the link were of my ring in assembly, like still mounted on the machinery, so I actually got -really- excited.  The proposal was seriously a surprise, and actually my ring in real life looks SO different from any of the renderings we worked on together and even the picture of it about 60% created with no stones. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised once it's actually on your finger!"

JustEngaged,33ct9m,justminick,6,Tue Apr 21 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"My engagement ring was my grandmother's. When I received it, it needed a lot of work--the center stone needed to be replaced, along with some of the small diamonds, and it was missing a band. There were also some small details I wanted to change to make it suit my personal style better.   I actually didn't know that this ring even existed until a few months before we got engaged. I had always wanted the ring to be a total surprise, and had been sending my now-husband pictures of rings that I liked (at his request) so he could pick out something himself. When I discovered my grandma's ring, everything changed.  I had been so worried that neither the ring nor the proposal would be the surprise I had always expected (we had our venue booked before we were engaged so that took a lot of the element of surprise out of it!). Luckily, my clever husband managed to find a way to totally catch me off-guard with the proposal, and finally seeing the ring all finished was absolutely thrilling. Not at all the anti-climactic moment I had been dreading. I couldn't stop staring at it all night, and nearly two years later I still catch myself constantly admiring it.   That jeweler is a freaking idiot, and I know you know it won't take away from you enjoying the moment, but take it from someone who understands that it will NOT detract from how much you will love your beautiful ring!!!"

I'll be honest, the jewelry store was actually a bit negative about the ring and it made me nervous because I had no clue what it would actually look like. Supposedly pearls are not traditionally used in engagement rings because they are less durable or may lose their luster? My FH said that the sales lady tried talking him out of it but he was headstrong about ""knowing what he wants."" I'm thrilled and can't wait to see it with the wedding band."
JustEngaged,339nzr,carrotsabound,5,Tue Apr 21 03:14:09 2015 UTC,I totally know what your husband went through.   I have a non slightly non traditional ring as well. Five smaller stones with a sweeping bezel setting. I absolutely love it. I've never liked a piece of jewelry more! But some people have... had a hard time accepting that my taste wasn't the norm.   Edited to add: I would also be interested to hear your thoughts on its durability after you've been wearing it a while! :)
JustEngaged,339nzr,carrotsabound,3,Tue Apr 21 03:17:01 2015 UTC,May I see your ring? It sounds pretty and not obnoxious.   I'll try to remember to update on the rings durability in the future! So far (one full day in) it hasn't gotten knocked on anything or been in the way. The jeweler did an impressive job making it sit low in the band. I had a large solitaire diamond ring from an ex (my daughters dad- live and learn ;) ) and it was always snagging on things and getting in the way. I'm really digging this ring.
JustEngaged,339nzr,carrotsabound,3,Tue Apr 21 03:30:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Hopefully this works, I'm on my phone:   Here but it's both my engagement ring and wedding band. :)  I re read your comment - my big thing was I wanted a ring that wouldn't snag, too.

JustEngaged,32vn4w,ga_girl,2,Fri Apr 17 14:54:42 2015 UTC,How many carats is that center stone? I ask because I inherited a big diamond from my grandma and if I get it recut it will lose 28% and end up at 1.6 carats. I ultimately want to create what you have here and need a comparison. Is your center over or under 1.6? Thanks and congrats

JustEngaged,32un9x,consuellabanana,6,Thu Apr 16 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from. I have a terrible relationship with my sister. In fact she was the last family member I told when I got engaged. All I got from her was 'Oh. Congratulations I guess.' And then she promptly told my parents she didn't even want to go to my wedding. Family sucks some times, but they are your family. Unfortunately you can either except them how they are or cut them out. Which is what I did with my sister. She will be at my wedding but only because my parents are dragging her. However her and I don't speak any more."
JustEngaged,32un9x,KetoThrowaway222,0,Fri Apr 17 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that. Was it only between you two, or her vs. your family?   The weird thing is that my sister and I have a good relationship. I know her deepest secrets and if I have any, she would know mine too. She texted me yesterday about a random thing like there nothing happened - it's just inexplicable."
JustEngaged,32un9x,KetoThrowaway222,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"She is nasty to everyone sometimes but it is the worst with me. We would go through the cycles of abuse where everything was awesome and then like jabs at me would occur, then it would get more frequent until finally she blows up at me and yells and berates me for no reason. Then it would start all over again.  My sister and I used to be ok too. This has happened over 12 years now. It started with her taking shots at me and then never apologizing for anything. My only advice is to start seeing boundaries now for how you will and won't accept being treated by her."
JustEngaged,32un9x,jbear,4,Fri Apr 17 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I'm sorry you went through that with her. Just ignore it. Do you think she's jealous?   Sisters aren't always the best. When my husband and I announced we were going to get married (no ring, we decided to use the money toward a house instead) everyone was very happy but she just said ""We expected, so why would you expect me to be jumping up and down excited?"" (We had been together almost 10 years) I was FURIOUS. I was even more upset when, three days later, she sent out a mass text showing off her ring and making a huge announcement to everyone that she and her bf of less than one year (nothing against it, just in her situation I am for certain reasons) were engaged. I stopped talking to her when she told half my family, especially the older ones in my family, that I was getting married. They all ""lost respect for me"" for not telling them- which I was going to, but was waiting until we were together in person versus over the phone.  ....I'm still mad at her for all the crap she pulled."
JustEngaged,32qw8c,littlemunchkin5,8,Thu Apr 16 00:05:23 2015 UTC,A lot of jewelry stores sell just the setting even if it looks like a ring with a stone already because often they sell them separately so people can set them with different quality of stones depending on budgets.
JustEngaged,32qw8c,imrightorlying,4,Thu Apr 16 00:36:32 2015 UTC,I'd recommend going to a local jeweler with your ring and a budget. You can check out ring styles from their store and talk to them about the kind of setting you like the most! We did this with a family stone that was in a broken setting and it was so much fun designing something new from something with so much meaning. I went in with an idea of what I wanted (bypass half bezel) but checked out other settings they had on hand without a centerstone. They ended up popping the diamond out of the old setting and showing it to me in a pink mold that they then used to cast the setting. My FH had already called around and visited this shop earlier to make sure they were great to deal with. Goodluck!!
JustEngaged,32qw8c,coloradodreaminn,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"This. With your request I would say to steer straight clear of chain jewelry stores. At my jeweler, 90% of the rings he has on display are filled with CZs, so you pick a stone and setting independently. Your situation should be no problem to any competent jeweler. If you find a good one, he or she can even make you a custom setting if you don't find what you want in their cases."
JustEngaged,32qw8c,MsBluffy,3,Thu Apr 16 16:23:31 2015 UTC,the center diamond in my ring used to belong to my future mother in law. My fianc√© was able to purchase just a setting from a local jeweler and he told me they were really helpful through the whole process. I don't know how much it cost and I don't wanna know. Look online too!
JustEngaged,32qw8c,supkaaaar,2,Thu Apr 16 01:52:23 2015 UTC,"Look into jewelry conventions! They have an endless variety of settings to choose from, from all different sorts of vendors. Prices are very good because it's wholesale.  My fianc√© had looked for a setting at upwards of a dozen jewelry stores (and a million Etsy shops) without success. We found the exact setting I wanted at jewelry show for less than $400. It's a great option and I highly recommend it!"
JustEngaged,32qw8c,weddingbee124,2,Thu Apr 16 03:07:02 2015 UTC,Have you checked out James Allen or Whiteflash? You can also look into someone like David Klass who custom designs settings at a reasonable price. Keep in mind the setting is usually made to custom fit your diamond's specs.  I found this one on the James Allen site just now. They can also set the diamond for you. Might be worth looking into.

He  said ""I know how long you've wanted this, I'm so sorry it took me so long."" and put a box in my hands. I opened it, and it was Chromecast (hahaha). Before I could even process that, he got down on one knee and popped the question. Our friends all knew it was happening, and they were all out waiting on us. It was great to be able to celebrate with everyone. :) He picked the ring out on his own (with a little help from my Pinterest board). It's perfect for me.
