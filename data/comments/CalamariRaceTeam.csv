I picture some guy, just trying to get ahead in life, things never really working out for him, stuck in traffic commuting from his shitty job.  He gets buzzed by 4 bikers, then suddenly wham, his car mirror explodes, and the biker just keeps going, now he has to go home to some wife he feels like he barely knows anymore, and explain that the car needs to be repaired for a couple hundred bucks.  She asks him incredulously if he called the police, or did anything at all, which makes him question his manhood and self-worth, all while eating a reheated pasta dinner in silence.  Later, he sits alone watching late night television, drinking a glass of medium grade whiskey, feeling the great unfairness of life."

There were only two lanes here, and so we decided to pass the slow ass truck in front of us - tucked in and cracked the throttle. As we came up from the tuck, I looked over in the opposite lane and saw a cop slam on his brakes off the side of the road. My buddy pulled up beside me and was frantically tapping his helmet - I just gave him a nod and we kept flying down the highway a bit quicker than we needed to. Never saw the cop again, nor any backup."

Edit:   the reason it's her last ride is because she was on a trailer without a ramp, but the bike shop down the street has a berm for loading and unloading.  i brought her there and rode her home, then trudged, broken ribs and all, back to get the truck and trailer.    edit edit:  this parking lot is the same place i bought her from.  kinda fitting that the last time i throw a leg over her is in the same place i did the first time, huh?"

A bloody tram ticket inspector no less. And because its early and I'm pissed at him blocking the traffic I decided to rev bomb him. I rev it up towards redline and dump the clutch and attempt to fly past him as he moves out of my way.

CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,Sergetove,5,Mon Jul 20 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"This is just my experience but after having several ""oh fuck I'm going to loop this"" moments at the same height, I realized that I was bitching out prematurely and progressively loosened up. Then pushed it a little higher or further the next practice session. Rinse and repeat. YMMV of course, but you're usually nowhere near as high as you think you are.   Also clutch ups tend to be safer from full on looping."
CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,Caffinz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Im more worried how sometimes I come down with the front not completely in line with the direction of travel. I'm pretty tight in the bars, so sometimes I jerk it to the side or I'm a little stiff when I come down, the bike tries to straighten out and I end up ""fighting it"". Sorry if thats confusing, I'm still a pretty new rider in general.   But thanks for the advice. I'll definitely keep that in mind when I get scared and think about chopping the throttle. I'm wanting to learn clutch up here pretty soon, but power wheelies seem more accesble. Would you recommend learning to do clutch ups first?"
CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,ridethepiggy,2,Mon Jul 20 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Loosen up on the bars, you don't want to add a bunch of additional inputs especially on landing. Just keep it straight and spinning, you'll be fine. Don't ride out wheelies too long the SV, it'll suffer from oil starvation issues. Don't chop the throttle. Ease off it and use your rear brake. Your rear brake is your ""oh shit"" emergency escape button as well. Be friends with it. Crank it, whip it and get it high!"
CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,insectplum,4,Mon Jul 20 12:37:37 2015 UTC,Grip the bike with your legs.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,IzoAzlion,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:50 2015 UTC,I'd be interested in knowing this also I'm in around the same position.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dwoox,imusbbored,2,Mon Jul 20 04:02:34 2015 UTC,Practicing wheelies on a bicycle will help get the feel of the balance point.  There are some excellent How to wheelie videos on youtube. Some bikes are more prone to slappers on landing than others. The softer yah landing the less likelihood you'll slap. Number 1 rule: Have fun.

CalamariRaceTeam,3dtx2p,l_Am_That_Guy,5,Sun Jul 19 23:33:34 2015 UTC,"Story time.   So around mid February I was riding around doing squid things when going into a tunnel I decided to downshift to do a mating call, and my revs went crazy. Like past rev limiter crazy. Next thing I know my acceleration disappears and there are no good potential mates around. I didn't know exactly what was wrong, but I could feel that something had fucked up. I gauged the situation and decided that I didn't want to walk back home, and my insurance had just expired(yea I know), so I made the logical decision and kept riding. I rode on at least one demolished piston for 30 minutes(taking many breaks, not going over 25mph), to a small time motorcycle shop that I thought looked decent enough and honestly I didn't want to ride for another minute. It sat there for 2 months because these dumb asses didn't check my warranty, after I told them I should still be covered. THEY TOLD ME IT HAD EXPIRED BUT THEY NEVER CHECKED!   So fast forward the two months where it was just sitting in the shop, when I finally get smart and decide to stop wasting my time on them and have it picked up. Now when we go to pick it up there were quite a few scratches that weren't there before, but I didn't even really care because they were on an already scratched up fairing. But still! How you gonna scratch my girl?!  I take it to the main shop in my area and they tell me my warranty had expired 2 weeks before(-_-). They still submitted the warranty claim to Kawasaki, and 2 weeks later they approved it! Called it a ""good will"" claim I believe, but I didn't fucking care, my bike was getting fixed for free!   After a month and a half of ""welllll we got all the parts in, mechanic should have it done by this Saturday.....then on Saturday....oh never mind jk, we don't have all the parts"".  Its all good now. And yes, I am covering the rear brake, notice how you cant see my other leg? Going out for some more riding...."

The thing about the DRZs is that you'll need to do the little mods to make it a better bike, airbox mod, re-jet, loctite, etc. Not saying it's a bad bike, but what made you want a brand spanking new one? I'd check out some classifieds to see if you can get something cheaper, for the money you'd spend on a 2k15, you could get something much better. I really don't mean to be a debbie downer here but I'm just being honest.  I picked up my Husky in pristine condition for $5k, and before I had seen it, I went to a dealership to price out a 2014 DRZ400SM. They wanted a little over $8500 out the door for it, I was SO close to pulling the trigger on it. Now I'm extremely glad I didn't, it would have been a huge mistake.  There are better sumos out there that are already tweaked right for much less than a new DRZ.  That being said - Supermotos are the most fun you can have on 2 wheels, just don't get yourself in trouble ;)"

CalamariRaceTeam,3dohvk,MathewC,34,Fri Jul 17 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about this all wrong.   Next time they do it, talk to them about riding. Be enthusiastic. Tell them what got you into riding. Relive your first ride with them and build that connection that riders have. Then plant the seed. Start by showing them how low bikes can MSRP. Then start slipping craigslist links to them. Send videos of awesomeness from YouTube. Hell, even gfycats. When they inevitably give in a few months later and buy a bike, go with them on their first big ride. After that, invite them out for another ride then offer lunch on you to celebrate their coming into a new lifestyle. Then go home and bust the biggest nut you ever have into a sandwich bag. Stow this away. Fast forward to the ride. When you guys reach the halfway point and you're hours from home, stop for a break. Make sure you stop somewhere scenic or somewhere they can stop to go take a piss. Offer to hold their helmet whilst they deal with it. Then take that sandwich bag full of your DNA and slip it between the liner and EPS in their helmet. Then ever-so-slightly open the end. Make sure that you're sweeper for them so that you can see the exact moment that it hits, then pass them and blast the fuck off. The next time that you say them, you say: ""This will teach you to keep your sweaty ass grease fingers off of my helmet."""

I don't mind riding with others, it's just that when it gets over a few and becomes a giant group ride, tends to be lame with hiccups, people riding over their limits, and bumping egos.  Also the pace is usually inconsistent reminds me of taking a slinky down some stairs.    I hear north of the cities is good, and I dig 60 and O in Wisconsin."

CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,xawesome,17,Fri Jul 17 00:19:49 2015 UTC,"You are supposed to completely release the clutch once you got the tire spinning, if you keep it halfway engaged it's going to eat your clutch really fast."

CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,denach644,6,Fri Jul 17 11:11:45 2015 UTC,This seems too much like common sense.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,DreamTheUnimaginable,5,Fri Jul 17 05:48:51 2015 UTC,First time doing it simply because the tire was being retired. Now it slips on anything past 3k rpms :(..... At least I got a cool slo-mo video out of it.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,ridethepiggy,11,Fri Jul 17 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"I KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENS. The exact same thing happened to me on my ninja, seriously, same exact situation same exact slipping past 3,000 rpm, it sounds like your bike is revving but the engine just isn't getting any catch. Your clutch plates rubbed together too quickly/tightly and got too hot. If you drain the oil and take off the gasket to your clutch assembly you'll see some neato rainbow streaks all over your clutch plates. Sucks, but you gotta replace them now. I did and my bike is right back to working in tip top condition. There is no other way to fix your bike from slipping past super low RPM besides doing this.  The reason this happens is you've probably been riding on your clutch for a pretty long time now, 15-20k miles, and the plates just hit a breaking point after being thrown through the gauntlet via burnout. By not letting out the clutch fast enough when you do this, it ends up putting some serious ware on those things VERY quickly. Next time you wanna do a burn out, rev up with the front break on and let out the clutch faster instead of holding it in. This compresses the plates and instead of sliding against each other at quick speeds like what you did, it's more like it's actually in gear so it doesn't fuck them quite as quickly.  Good luck dude, if you want me to send you instructions on how to do an assembly yourself instead of paying a shop hundreds of dollars to do it send me a PM and I'd be glad to give you a step by step just for you."
CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,Mr_Bignutties,2,Fri Jul 17 01:17:31 2015 UTC,Nice burnout clip though!

CalamariRaceTeam,3dkhe2,DiscoPandaKungFu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:45 2015 UTC,I've not had to do this yet on mine but I've read on certain bikes there is a clutch adjustment somewhere. If you ate some of the clutch away you might still be able to adjust it closer without a full replacement. Check for your specific bike before doing all that work.

CalamariRaceTeam,3dle7r,Hipoglucido,3,Sat Jul 18 04:02:06 2015 UTC,I have this saved from when this question appeared in another thread
CalamariRaceTeam,3dle7r,scar-tissue,3,Fri Jul 17 07:22:23 2015 UTC,How hard are the early 2000's carbureted bikes to work on. As in are the carbs themselves a pain and always need tweaking or are they able to be left alone between tune ups?
CalamariRaceTeam,3dle7r,climbingrocks,5,Fri Jul 17 07:43:42 2015 UTC,Only time I needed to mess with carbs is when the bike sat for too long and the gas got dirty in them. If you ride often or just turn your bike on once a month you'll be fine. Depending on the bike getting the carbs off could be a pain but cleaning them won't be.  Another thing to note is you might need to re jet the carbs to add or subtract gas if you mod it with aftermarket exhaust and air filters but that depends on how big of a mod it is and how the bike runs after you do it. That would be the really hard part in my opinion.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dle7r,satanic_pony,2,Fri Jul 17 09:43:10 2015 UTC,Thank you for the information. That wi allow me to expand much search to older bikes. Saw a few 2000-2002 gsxr600s for like $2k or so.

CalamariRaceTeam,3dgs0i,ImNotAPowerUser,3,Thu Jul 16 08:43:03 2015 UTC,"To select a Gear motorcycles use something called dogs, they are like little teeth that sick out the side of the gears to engage them. If the dogs don't fit together then you can't get it into gear, letting the clutch out a little will help to line them up allowing you to change gear again. This video shows it pretty well https://youtu.be/vq11CusULlk"
CalamariRaceTeam,3dgs0i,Rheem,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:40:38 2015 UTC,Hold down the clutch and roll forward a bit next time. Reduces pressure on the fork and allows you to shift again.

CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,squidofsteel,16,Thu Jul 16 19:51:12 2015 UTC,Kind of ironic complaining about someone doing something stupid/against the law in this sub...
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,Knoxie_89,4,Thu Jul 16 20:18:26 2015 UTC,I think it's because this is a special kind of stupid.
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,windowpuncher,3,Thu Jul 16 23:00:48 2015 UTC,As a cyclist....  I completely agree.
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,Knoxie_89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:29:01 2015 UTC,The real irony is I have more upvotes here than in /r/motorcycles!  But irony is just human behavior.
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,Sto_Da_Dio,13,Thu Jul 16 20:43:54 2015 UTC,HEY GUYS IM GONNA RIDE ON A PUBLIC ROAD  BUT NOT FOLLOW THE LAWS OF SAID ROAD  FUCK THE POLICE
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,loves_2_sp00ge,8,Thu Jul 16 21:59:44 2015 UTC,Hahahah... Wait.
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,loves_2_sp00ge,7,Fri Jul 17 02:12:21 2015 UTC,They teach you to walk against traffic so you can see the cars. I guess he took that rule and applied it to a bicycle?
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,broken_cogwheel,2,Thu Jul 16 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"It's the opposite for bicycles because if you are in a line of cars, go to make a right turn (or left turn in left-hand countries) you can see down the right side via your side-view mirror. You cannot, however, see past the cars in front of you.  If a bicyclist is booking it AGAINST TRAFFIC then you can't see them until they hit you or fly in front of your car and get turned into red paste."
CalamariRaceTeam,3djiot,rustbe1t,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"This way if a texting driver is going to ram you, you have a chance to see it coming and bail into the grass.  Pretty simple.  Modern urban areas are rarely designed for bicycle and foot traffic, so he probably doesn't have a choice about riding on this road if he has a specific destination in mind."

CalamariRaceTeam,3dfmxm,Trooper636,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:23 2015 UTC,Can't pull me over if they can't catch me.
CalamariRaceTeam,3dh20y,broffesorpabst,2,Thu Jul 16 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"dude... you should mount one on each side of your fairings pointing either toward you, or in front and then one on your wind screen on your tail. Record one wicked session of corning hard on both sides then edit it. BOOM action shots of your awesome session. Then post it here because I want to see it."
CalamariRaceTeam,3dh20y,HoodoftheMountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:56:40 2015 UTC,"i placed a mount just in front of my passenger holds and on my chainside swing arm, now if only I had friends, I could make it look cool, like as if the SV was faster then them."
