I reread it thinking that the twist was different,  but I'm not seeing anything else. It just strike me, if it's not supernatural,  that it just doesn't work. The ""illusion "" couldn't be maintained."
shortscarystories,3dvgr2,timetock,5,Mon Jul 20 04:50:20 2015 UTC,"I did think about that and honestly I think it could work. When I wrote this I thought of her as a crook with a small operation which just got massive. And just like any crook she sees everything as business and investments to future business. I mean not everyone she does readings for she plans on killing someone. Maybe sometimes she's says they'll find love, so she pays one of her goons to threaten the person they have a crush on, or if she says they'll come into some money and make a small anonymous donation to them. Basically I see her as a kingpin type character with a tight operation."

shortscarystories,3drzzu,Cereborn,3,Sun Jul 19 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy about it, either....I'd been messing with it for a couple days, and not getting it to do what I wanted. I just got annoyed with it--you're right, though, it just kind of drifts off into him possibly hunger-hallucinating.  Sometimes, a story just won't cooperate ;p"
shortscarystories,3drzzu,TheOneTrueJeebus,3,Sun Jul 19 11:09:03 2015 UTC,"I think the story itself is bloody magical. Great job! However, the mention of rescue teams seemed insignificant and thus not much good in a short story where every sentence matters.   Perhaps the ending could be Kyle imagining a sunny, bright beach where he's laying in a hammock until the light gets so bright that he just follows it to see where it's going. To show that he's using his imagination to be in a better place until the italicised words stop to show that he is no longer imagining, and going towards the light (dying)."

Sometimes you struggle with a story so much, the obvious just doesn't come out till someone else points it out. The idea of being trapped like that after a natural disaster has always terrified me, even more so now that I have kids.  I reckon it's a good thing I live in mild-mannered Pennsylvania, where an ice storm or snowstorm a couple times a year is the worst we get :)"

shortscarystories,3dr2el,Dove_of_Doom,20,Sat Jul 18 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"If anyone's interested, here's what I was thinking when I wrote this: The attack and harvesting of Earth tie thematically into the narrator's mindset. He (or she) was consumed by grief for his mother, and now he's grieving everyone. His mother died of lung cancer, and a swarm of ""black masses"" slaughters everyone around him, with Aunt Sophie, the only person he was close to, killed when ""tendrils penetrated her chest."" He was cut off and unable to connect with people, and now he never will. At the beginning, his aunt wanted him to get out of ""that empty house"", and at the end he's trapped in an ""emptier world."" To me, the creatures, besides whatever they literally are, serve as nightmarish manifestations of the narrator's depression, social anxiety, fear of abandonment, and survivor's guilt. They leave him alone because, as far as he and they are concerned, he's already dead inside."
shortscarystories,3dr2el,LORDSANTAENGLISH,8,Sat Jul 18 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"It was nice without having a deeper meaning.  I'd thought it had refused to go after the guy because he was an introvert. They only went after the extroverts, social media types, people that share and seek out connections and are open.   Someone closed off like that wouldn't be able to sate their hunger for knowledge and memories of being a party animal and stuff, as well as the souls of the extroverts. They'd have nothing to offer the things.  And so the world is inherited by the quiet ones that would rather not go interacting with each other, screwing the planet over."
shortscarystories,3dr2el,The6oclocknightmare,2,Sat Jul 18 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Your take is pretty close to what I was thinking. It's not necessarily about being introverted, but it's certainly a part of it. I'm not sure how effectively it comes across, but the narrator has been a shut-in since his mother died, and he's suffering from depression and Avoidant Personality Disorder. The key to me is that these afflictions are keeping him from truly living, and the creatures only consume life."
shortscarystories,3dr2el,Tru-Man,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:59 2015 UTC,I loved your writing and the story was also great but the twist was pretty okay. I liked your explanation too it was really deep.
shortscarystories,3dr2el,judgeUsilentlyRnot,2,Sat Jul 18 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I wrote the setup depicting the panic attack without any idea where I was going with it after he returns to the party. Once I improvised the attack scene, I read through it and noticed the parallels and connections to what the character was feeling and rewrote it to try and emphasize them. Hopefully it works on both a literal and a symbolic level."

shortscarystories,3dr2el,CreamySpudz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't really like the first one. The second is the classic that established what I think of as Evil Dead. No offense intended. I was just a little thrown by the Zim connection to a boomstick reference."
shortscarystories,3dr2el,Soulren,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"No offense taken. I liked them all, but I was PISSED how the first and second ones were completely disjointed from each other. I prefer the second and third ones because they actually nicely lead into each other.  Third one was freaking hilarious. And it had two endings, the common known ending, and a lost ending.  Common known ending: Ash fucks up, speaks the words from the book wrong, but ends up in the present, where he was telling all of this as a story to one of his coworkers back in not-k-mart. Then suddenly another wraith demon shows up and screams it'll swallow his soul, all hell breaks loose, he blows its head off, revealing the cybernetic metal hand he'd crafted for himself in the past, and the movie ends with him kissing the woman.  Lost ending: He beat the forces of evil, same as the other ending, but the book is useless to send him forward in time, it can only send him further back. So, a sleeping potion of sorts is concocted. It'll put him in a deep state of hibernation of sorts, until his time rolls around. He just needs to hide in a cave until then. So he shoves the car in the cave, barricades it up, and starts taking the potion. But a sound he hears makes him miscount the drops of it he takes, and he takes one too many. He ends up waking up in a post-apocalyptic future where the world is in ruins and he's screaming and crying about sleeping too long and how he should have just stayed in the past.  (these are both real endings, feel free to google it)"

I vaguely recall an account from someone who suffered damage to the part of the brain responsible for shutting your brain off for sleep (the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus or VLPO). It was horrifying to say the least. Essentially, he called every moment torture.  This is different than that genetic condition described by /u/Medesha   Like you said, they still could technically sleep, but it was never restful.  In the account relayed to me, I do believe the sufferer did ultimately commit suicide, just like in your story.  Sadly, I have been unable to find the citation for this account so you should treat it with skepticism."

The ADA (americans with disabilities act) protects those who are not all there mentally.  But since his father was his legal guardian/caregiver, HE would be the one going to prison. He was legally in charge of the guy, and let him go out to get into fights. And once the situation is explained to the cops, more charges will be levied against him, for encouraging that fight.  Either way though, nice twist, and jail or detention facility, the place he's going is going to be terrible and terrifying, that's for sure."
shortscarystories,3dmfgu,LORDSANTAENGLISH,4,Fri Jul 17 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we have the same thing here in the UK (though granted I DID write it as if it were in the US.)  In Britain, if a mentally disabled person commits a crime that would normally land someone in jail, they can avoid prison on the grounds of ""Diminished Responsibility"" and instead be placed in a secure accommodation/unit of some description.   I did take this into account when I wrote this, and you're right that he wouldn't go to prison due to his mental condition. However, I couldn't think of a good way to write that down, I just thought ""you're going to prison"" is a way more biting end.   ""You're going to a secure unit"" just didn't seem to pack as much punch. You're totally right though :-)"

shortscarystories,3df1ni,trung87,6,Fri Jul 17 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"While the idea that Pluto is alive gives me some chills, I am not on board with the panic the astronaut is passing on to his friend. I mean, what can Pluto instantly do from his corner of space that Mike's friend should find 'the deepest cave you can, and HIDE'? Given that Pluto is an orbiting mass of icy alien materials, what harm can it do to Earth at the point of the astronaut's transmission? Also, what good would hiding in the deepest cave do if you are against a dwarf planet (or whatever Pluto is classified now as)?  I would appreciate the story better if you ended at the line: ""Pluto is alive... and we WOKE it!"" That way, the readers are free to imagine what Pluto might do as an awoken entity instead of a planet, as compared to confining the readers with hiding from Pluto, which doesn't really makes sense to me.  Still, good job on giving me some chills. An alive Pluto is something I haven't read in here."

shortscarystories,3dffp6,omniamorous,16,Wed Jul 15 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"So the narrator didn't try touching their eyes when they ""woke up blind""?  That seems like the first thing I would do, long before I get on a video chat with an optometrist.  It also seems like something you'd notice, not think you're blind.  Unless this is some ethereal presence which he can't see, which is covering his eyes spiritually, but can somehow be seen through the computer's web-cam, I feel like this has a huge gaping hole in the logic that really detracts from the story."

I don't know if it's better this way but at least it dodges the gap in logic (which I totally understand was there)."

Yeah I tussled with this for a bit myself, but I'm not sure how to add in something like that without it sounding tacky.   Understandable, it's a hard piece to make work, as you can't have someone else be there in person or it throws it off.  If you were going for a supernatural vibe, rather than a stalker-in-the-house situation, you could have them feel their eyes and think there's a strange growth over them.  Maybe include that flakes of flesh came off, and there are hard lumps (knuckes, dead body of some form).  That's still rough because then you'd have to adjust what the Dr. saw, and it would make that part hard.  I think you have a couple really good ideas, but they may just not work together.  I would earmark these concepts for use in later stories, and keep them in your tool-box for future works.  Granted, I am not a writer myself (I have zero writing talent), so other folks would probably be able to give better advice.  I just love reading the stories here, and like to provide helpful feedback where I can."

I am not sure if it's related to MS but I figured it's worth mentioning. Even the diagnosis took awhile though because besides the optic neuritis everything else was normal. It took 3 months of tests to finally figure it all out, there's even the beginnings of a lesion on my brain stem that wasn't there 3 months ago so it's all been moving fast since then."

It's just a picture of an utterly defeated humanity without hope. I wanted to keep the details matter-of-fact and the Shrouds er, shrouded in mystery.  I guess it's too dense. There's so much information put across and backstory hinted at that the main line of the story is hard to follow.

Makes it seem like out of nowhere there's a third person involved.   In another comment you eluded to there being no looters and rapists because only .01% survived, but the last part of the story says ""expected"" survival rate. Maybe say something like ""WORLD SURVIVAL RATE STILL HOLDING AT/ABOVE/BELOW EXPECTED SURVIVAL RATE OF .01%.""  Otherwise that was a good read. Really made mark out to be a creep."

shortscarystories,3dbzml,omniamorous,4,Wed Jul 15 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"The narrator (Thomas) goes to his girlfriend's (Anna's) apartment, where she lives with her mother and father. Anna has been on vacation for a while and Thomas has not seen her in a long time. Anna's parents are foreign and therefore tend to say things very literally.   While inside the house, Thomas begins to notice the expensive items that have recently been purchased, such as furniture and jewelry. This is strange because Anna's father has always been very tight with money. Thomas recalls at the end of the story that Anna's father has been unemployed for several years, so it is illogical he would have enough money for all of these items.  Through context clues, the reader can interpret that Anna's parents cut off her left arm and left leg and sold them to pay for their new material possessions. This can be seen in the lines ""She missed her other half"" , ""She has been feeling very incomplete"", and, most obviously,  ""After all, it cost us an arm and a leg."" I hope this helps you understand the story better! There are a few more subtle lines that I was hoping people would pick up on as well, but this pretty much sums up the story."

But, it took me like five minutes sitting here to realize that he was turning human again by transmitting the curse. You say ""While it's true vampirism transmits from one to another, in my case, it did something....odd.It turned me human again."" So I was thinking, ""huh, vampirism causes you turn human again?"" Maybe I'm just dumb (no one else here seems confused :P), but I could've used some clarification on the process. Also at another point he says he couldn't turn his loved ones, why not? Right before that it seems to imply that he's immortal, meaning he's a vampire.  Anyway, a character like this would be so cool as the protagonist of a novel. I'd love to read it!"

The story came about when I thought: ""People love having logos on their shirt and properties, but what if this logo means something else than what they originally thought.""  I originally thought of the word ""food"" but that word can be taken in a different context (do you have food? Is there food? I like food.). I chose the word ""edible"" since the definition of the word I found was ""fit to consume"", the context of the word is less flexible and having a symbol that means that tattooed on your skin... oh boy.

shortscarystories,3d1b4c,daicalun07,10,Mon Jul 13 06:42:40 2015 UTC,"I have been pondering the meaning of this story as well. After reading through it for a couple more minutes, I think I've figured it out.    It says that if you're found guilty of the 8th sin, you are doomed to eternal damnation. It also says that if you pass the 8th sin, AKA fear, onto someone else, you can escape eternal damnation.    You can see as the story progresses, the mood becomes more and more eerie, such as the mysterious thick liquid, vicious cat creatures and dark atmosphere. I think this means that eternal damnation is coming soon, or they are already in it.    Then at the end, the friend scares the main character by putting his hand on his shoulder, effectively passing on fear. This implies that the friend committed the 8th sin, and passed it onto the main character, using him as a sacrifice to escape eternal damnation. The main character is now alone in eternal damnation, and the friend's disappearance means he escaped alone.    This is just my speculation I could be wrong. If I am and anybody else knows the actual meaning, I would love to hear it."

shortscarystories,3cv15x,jarquafelmu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:08 2015 UTC,What the bloody hell. I love it.
shortscarystories,3cv15x,DntLkVwls,-6,Fri Jul 17 02:31:48 2015 UTC,i assume a morgue has something to do with abortion but i have no idea. Goddamit now i have to google it.
shortscarystories,3cv15x,Theoddonewhoknocks,18,Sat Jul 11 05:36:38 2015 UTC,It's a place where dead bodies are stored temporarily
shortscarystories,3d0mom,aly11899,2,Sun Jul 12 14:48:30 2015 UTC,Good dog
shortscarystories,3d0mom,LORDSANTAENGLISH,2,Sun Jul 12 14:55:30 2015 UTC,Idk maybe you forgot to feed him?
shortscarystories,3d0mom,zeshanator98,2,Sun Jul 12 17:13:28 2015 UTC,How is this scary? Its sad. A pet turning on its owner makes me tear up. But noises jumping to evil dog don't make sense in my mind. Maybe you made him mad moving him to a new place
shortscarystories,3d0mom,ForeverFoxyLove,2,Sun Jul 12 20:37:00 2015 UTC,The point I was trying to get to was d demonic possession... I guess I didn't portray it the right way... sorry first story 😳

shortscarystories,3d0mom,zeshanator98,2,Mon Jul 13 06:25:09 2015 UTC,"Hey so it's your first time and you didn't get it right. No problemo man, just read a couple of the top stories and soon you'll be writing real fine stories."

shortscarystories,3cx7qd,BludBat,2,Sat Jul 11 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"A guys gotta eat a guy who has to eat! Good idea, eat him before he gets all gassy and stuff!"
shortscarystories,3cx7qd,Tru-Man,2,Sun Jul 12 00:38:03 2015 UTC,But if he's eating Mexican hes gonna get gassy anyway

shortscarystories,3cz3f0,lollipoplickers,3,Sun Jul 12 02:20:27 2015 UTC,Oh my god!
shortscarystories,3cz3f0,MysteriousWitch,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:33 2015 UTC,No he's MY God. Don't even think about talking to my God. Back off or I'll end you.
shortscarystories,3cz3f0,LORDSANTAENGLISH,4,Sun Jul 12 02:35:45 2015 UTC,"Now now, I can be both your god."

shortscarystories,3cz3f0,LORDSANTAENGLISH,2,Sun Jul 12 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you can be a leprechaun, or a corpse."
shortscarystories,3cz3f0,MysteriousWitch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:14:00 2015 UTC,How will you end me ? By giving me lollipops to lick . I will definitely die (from laughing so hard). Lol lmfao

shortscarystories,3cz3f0,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:49:13 2015 UTC,But if you ask Cortana she is useless. I need a Siri of my own
shortscarystories,3cz3f0,ForeverFoxyLove,3,Sun Jul 12 05:32:19 2015 UTC,Shes mine now. You got that?
shortscarystories,3cz3f0,GlaringAngrily,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:33:31 2015 UTC,Well see >.>

shortscarystories,3cz3f0,LORDSANTAENGLISH,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:20:49 2015 UTC,LOL
shortscarystories,3cvkva,ScreamingMadDee,6,Sat Jul 11 03:29:10 2015 UTC,Why couldn't Twilight have been THIS instead of gay sparkle vampires?  Then I'd read it!  I loved this.
shortscarystories,3cvkva,LORDSANTAENGLISH,3,Sat Jul 11 05:07:20 2015 UTC,It actually is like this when you remove Bella being a whiny bitch and Edwards wanna be angst.
shortscarystories,3cvkva,ForeverFoxyLove,2,Sat Jul 11 06:11:38 2015 UTC,Well that would have been awesome.
shortscarystories,3cvkva,LORDSANTAENGLISH,2,Sat Jul 11 11:52:31 2015 UTC,The werewolf vs vampire war. It was the only good part
shortscarystories,3cvkva,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:54:17 2015 UTC,I decided that I didn't want to hate every book ever after so I never read them
shortscarystories,3cvkva,Tru-Man,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"It made me appreciate good writing that much more. Seeing as I could finish the 7th harry potter book by morning the night it came out... I couldn't just hate every book. I highly suggest reading her book ""the host"" because it shows that she does have talent hidden somewhere"
shortscarystories,3cvkva,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:29:09 2015 UTC,Except then they weren't really werewolves because Meyers wanted to be different.
shortscarystories,3cvkva,jyetie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:38:43 2015 UTC,"Right. The entire story was kind of sad. The whole concept of secret societies is a very overused trope that just dampens the actuality of the real ones. And she way overdid any ""uniqueness"" I mean what kind of predator SPARKLES"
shortscarystories,3cvkva,ForeverFoxyLove,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"I love the whole ancient tone of this story with names like masters and widow Jenkins, awesome!"
