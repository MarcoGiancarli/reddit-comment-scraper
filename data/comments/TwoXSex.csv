You know how people jokingly say they ""watch it for the plot"" (like reading Playboy for the articles)? Well, I read for the plot! I guess I have kinks for certain scenarios and a good story helps me better fantasize and visualize what turns me on. What's awesome is you can picture the characters as whoever you like...your partner(s), your crush, Jennifer Lawrence, Tom Hardy...instead of being stuck with whoever is acting in the scene you're watching. It's like roleplaying for one.  As for where to read porn...I can't think of any specific sites, actually. Whenever the mood strikes me I tend to just search through whatever's out there until I find what I need.  ...and that was totally not helpful at all!

TwoXSex,3dxjdx,OneRedSent,3,Mon Jul 20 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"Update: I looked into it. Everything I've found says that coconut oil specifically only helps fight candida and even BV. I figured I'd let you know, since it has always been a great option for me. I want you to know that it's safe as well. :) So if you ever thought about using it, you know that it doesn't cause yeast infections.   http://www.yeastconnection.com/archive/fighting_ask_may05.html  Also, during my research I found that many water-based lubricants can cause yeast infections because a very common ingredient is glycerin, which is a kind of sugar-based compound, I believe.   Silicone is more difficult to clean, and because it's thick it encourages more bladder infections (which I'm prone to) and bacterial infections of the vagina. It's not a huge risk if you can sit in a bath and soak it off, or wipe thoroughly after sex. But it's not inherently anti-bacterial, like coconut oil is. And from what I read, it sounds like silicone can cause tissue irritation and more damage over time? I don't know why, if it's the ingredients or the texture or what. But that was confusing.   I also just really hate how lube tastes. But for quickies or days where I know I will be showering before sex happens again (meaning I won't have to taste it), silicone-based lubricants sound like they might be a good option. I can't use my clitoral toy when using silicone lube, so that's also something to keep in mind.   Water-based lube is safe to use with my toy, but they can have irritating ingredients.   And oil isn't as thick as silicone, so it doesn't protect against friction as well.   Why are lubes so complicated?!"
TwoXSex,3dxjdx,Snowwhitesevencats,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. You're right that water-based lubes often contain glycerin which can feed candida. Look for glycerin-free if that's a concern. Silicone might be best, but it's a pain to clean up. Oil is too, though, so I guess it won't be any worse in that respect. Good luck."
TwoXSex,3dxjdx,OneRedSent,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"Oil can be, depending on the kind of oil. Thankfully coconut absorbs right into the skin. So after sex it just soaks in and moisturizes! None of the icky stickiness that silicone leaves. Plus it makes his cock taste like cookies hahah"

Especially if this is someone you know,  trust,  and like.  So I think you don't need to worry over that,  being attracted to one woman does not necessarily have any bearing on your overall sexual identity /attractions.  There's nothing wrong with that!   However, going any farther with her right now will really damage your relationship with your bf,  and I don't think you want that.  I definitely agree that it would be best to talk to him about it,  and to talk about you exploring these feelings. Plus,  being intoxicated can lead into things you wouldn't normally be comfortable doing,  and can get you into bad situations pretty quickly.

I'm pretty sure there was lots more groping etc, but the betrayal hurt so much.  don't do that to your boyfriend. be better than my girl! go to bed and sleep it off. your relationship will be better for it. go enjoy some sweet (or wet) dreams."

I'm not talking about sleeping with her, or with any other woman necessarily. But your visceral reaction to what happened ... well, you shouldn't pretend you didn't feel what you felt. Explore it somehow. There's a homoerotic undercurrent to a lot of life; people who see themselves as straight don't much acknowledge that they feel it, I think. So when such a feeling emerges, we're a little more shocked than we should probably be. Give yourself permission to have hidden depths, and remember that electric feeling that came when you threw out your old sexual script and surprised yourself.   More doors are open to you now. Please do let us know what you actually do in the end. Best of luck."

TwoXSex,3dkyv9,Creepella_the_third,7,Fri Jul 17 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"The biggest evidence in the ""you'll be okay"" category is that you urinated after ejaculating. The concern for precum containing sperm has to do with leftover sperm from the previous ejaculation in the urethra. Urinating flushes that out, so it's highly unlikely that there would be sperm in your precum at that point. Of course, it wouldn't be good to rely on that alone, but it makes pregnancy highly highly unlikely in this case, even if you hadn't also done Plan B. Source: med student"
TwoXSex,3dkyv9,IntellectualThicket,6,Fri Jul 17 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"While the other replies are absolutely correct, and it is very unlikely, it's important to note that you can get pregnant from the small amount of precum that could still be present after having come, been sucked off and washed.  I say this only because sexual education on this topic is notoriously poor and it's important to understand that while your risk was small, it is still possible.  The reason the chances are so small in this situation are threefold:   You had already gotten off and washed up; presumably you were still experiencing your refractory period, making it less likely to become sexually stimulated, thus reducing the chances of precum being present. A broken condom doesn't fully protect against fluid transmission, but it is still more difficult for sexual fluids to freely move around (even damaged) barriers than it would be if you were penetrating without protection. If there was precum, it would have had a (somewhat) more difficult time reaching a point where it could fertilize, and Because of the timing, she is much less likely to be fertile having just passed an egg.   Essentially, her cycle would have to be doing something funky, you would have had to be producing an unusual amount of semen, and that semen still had to deal with the normal obstacles, as well as the possible added restriction of the condom, in order to do it's job.  All those things could happen. At the same time. Believe me, or any number of people who have had children despite using multiple forms of birth control and pulling out. But it is very unlikely.  Last thought: I've never heard of a condom making a ""popping"" sound and breaking during normal use. Are you sure it wasn't just a queef or something?"

TwoXSex,3dkyv9,miyakohouou,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's so hard to get a feel for the risk level on some of these things. My spouse is going off of birth control because all of the pharmacies around us have stopped caring the brand they were on and now only carry a generic that caused them to have horrible side effects. Originally they were taking it for acne and since it didn't seem to be helping a lot with that anyway they decided to go off it.  We should be at very very low risk for pregnancy anyway, I've been on hrt for over 2 years, undetectable testosterone levels, barely anything comes out at this point except some clear fluid; we never engage in penetrative sex, but we do share toys and have some external genital contact, don't wash up immediately, etc and knowing what risk we're at after they stop birth control is really hard for us to figure out.

My guess is insufficient lubrication leading to some tiny abrasions that stopped bleeding as soon as the friction quit, but your guess is as good as mine. There was some residual soreness once or twice, but not till I knew there'd been blood so it could have been psychological.   Sometimes I'll have some extra spotting a couple days after my period after an intense orgasm, so it could be a few things. I wouldn't worry about imminent death from disease just yet."
TwoXSex,3dcqvs,Pixiepup,3,Wed Jul 15 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"Sometime our bodies are weird and random and you may never know. Nasty question time: Was it red or brown? Brighter blood is fresher and points more towards irritation or a tear, meanwhile, darker blood is older and clotted and therefore may be leftover period blood that got stuck somewhere for a day and was then dislodged. Occasional spotting is actually par for the course for many women and there is a first time for everything.  If you find that the spontaneous bleeding continues through this cycle it could be an indication of infection. Some women get minor infections on the cervix, which leads to inflammation, and then sexual activity can cause some bleeding. If you are worried, a couple swabs at the doc can test for some common stuff and most of it is easily treatable.  Although there are a million and a half things that could cause small amounts of random bleeding, luckily for us, our bodies are self-repairing and often take care of whatever the problem is without intervention. However, keep an out for any other problem signs like fever, cramping, pain, or abnormal discharge, as these are more infection-like."

You put the stain on your lips, let it dry with open mouth for at least a minute (seriously, otherwise your lips will stick together - not great for sexy times) and then seal with a balm or gloss depending on the product. I have one from Max Factor called ""Lipfinity"" but there are loads out there. Good luck! I know my SO enjoys when my lips are red while going down on him, but he actually loves when it smudges. ;)"

For oral, your guy most likely needs to stop using so much pressure and/or stop stimulating the clit so directly. Really pay attention to what feels best when you masturbate and try to describe to him what he should do. Oral can be awesome. But when it's not done pleasurably it sure is lame, as you know."

Personally, I  really enjoy when my SO spends a lot of time and attention at the area where thigh meets mons/labia. Since its less sensitive, he can hang out there for quite a while.   Make it a game of hot and cold - have him lick/suck/kiss around, not just the clit or vaginal opening, but the whole area. Find out what you both enjoy"

You can ask him to tell you right before he comes and finish him with your mouth (keep the hand motion going as you do so). Once he's come in your mouth and sees that you do it because you enjoy it, he might become more comfortable with it. You can also lick him clean after intercourse to show that you're comfortable with come in your mouth.  You can also ask him to fantasize about coming from oral from you when he masturbates to help him get in the right frame of mind with it."

My advice would be to not take it seriously. If he knows you're having a lot of fun and laughing and stuff it'll take a lot of the pressure off. If you're too serious it maybe puts a lot of pressure on and he gets stressed about the fact that he has to perform for you, which yeah, has the opposite effect to what you want really.   I know it can be hard but just don't take it seriously and don't have any expectations. At the very least he'll enjoy it more and that should be the end goal, not necessarily orgasm."

I think you just need to reinforce your message that you enjoy being down there, you want to do it and that it's not degrading in your mind and it shouldn't be in his mind either (unless that's one of your kinks, but I think you should get over this first). As you pointed out, he has never been with someone who likes these things and I think you should ask him, if he has been with someone who did think it was degrading? That might play a major part in it."

I remember best that it had been about a week since we had had sex and during that time I asked him not to masturbate(not because im against it or anything, I love that he masturbates) because I wanted us both to be crazy horny and have crazy desperate sex.   well when we were about to start, I decided that it was time and i just went to town on his dick, I did everything I always wanted to do, I sucked and licked and went totally crazy. he came in about 4-5 minutes and said it was the best feeling ever. since then he able to come now from blowjobs, something about finally feeling what it was like and loving it.   another big thing he has told me is that he can ""sense"" when I am super horny and into the blowjob and its what really helps him along.  if I am not into it even if im trying really hard he wont come, something about it.   try going a week sans sex and masturbating, spend the week kissing, teasing, touching, but no sex or ejaculation, and then when neither of you can take it anymore just suck the living hell out of his dick. maybe you will get the same ending I did. I hope you do."

I would say don't give him a blowjob during though. Do something he currently enjoys, like a handjob or penetration, so he can associate the visual of a blowjob with the enjoyable feeling of other types of sex.  For now, work up to extended blowjobs. Do just a minute or two for foreplay before sex. If you keep going until he goes soft, he'll associate blowjobs with not being turned on, or with not having a good time. Switching over to something else means there's no time to lose interest. It also builds up the association of ""blowjobs are good and eventually lead to finishing.""  And in general, give it time. My husband had never gotten off that way either when I first met him. Having a partner who cares about your happiness can also make a lot of difference."

TwoXSex,3cnixo,Aldrea01,10,Fri Jul 10 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, the misoprostol didn't really do more than feel funny going in, almost a slight tingly/really mild burning sensation just from the medicine in the pills feeling weird. It doesn't induce actual contractions, it should just soften the cervix. That was the easiest part for me. The insertion isn't fun, I feel your pain (haha, a bit literally). I think the cervix softener really helps though. My doctor was able to successfully place it, thanks to that. I hope you have some better luck at this next appointment!   One word of caution, and I'm surprised that your Gyn didn't say anything about this, but if you have a history of bad cramping, the copper IUD tends to make that worse. Heavier periods and more cramping are the usual with them. Mirena, in comparison, lightens periods and cramping, sometimes even stopping periods all together, and it's such a small dose of hormones directly where they need to be that sex drive is almost never negatively impacted. There shouldn't be a big difference in getting one or the other, so I'd research it and consider asking your doctor for a different type of IUD if your cramps and periods are already bad =\ Good luck again!"
TwoXSex,3cnixo,sqwirk,2,Thu Jul 9 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this makes me feel a lot better. My OBGYN said the word ""contractions"" when she was explaining it to me and it totally freaked me out. She did mention that a side effect of Paragard was worse cramps and heavier periods, but I still wanted to go through with it because I really want non-hormonal birth control and I figured I already knew how to deal with bad periods."
TwoXSex,3cnixo,inc0nceivable,5,Thu Jul 9 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any trouble with the procedure but they did need to dilate my cervix slightly in order to insert my Mirena IUD. I didn't really feel that part of the process. When they inserted it, there was a lot of pressure and it hurt, but I mentally tried to go to my happy place and just let it happen because of the benefits. I bled for about a month after getting my IUD, mostly because after two weeks with it in, I had sex and was too rough. I've had it for a year and a half now and don't get more than just two days of spotting and light cramps (my cramps used to be TERRIBLE). I second what /u/Aldrea01 said about the copper IUD and cramping -- my cramps are why I went with Mirena, per my doctor's suggestion. I was worried because of the hormonal part of it but it really hasn't caused me any troubles like birth control pills have (break outs and such)"
TwoXSex,3cnixo,SexySmiles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"I also had a lot of pain with the insertion of the Skyla (smaller version of the Mirena - designed for women who have not yet had children - lasts 3 years opposed to 5). The doc neglected to tell me to take pain meds beforehand, although I'm not really sure it would have made much of a difference, and I found it to be fairly painful. Not as painful as what you're describing, but enough that I cried out several times and was moving all over the place in pain, which made the doc mad, but eff him.   Try to keep your mind in a calm place and remember that women go through this all of the time. Once it's inserted, you're done for over 10 years!!! Hang in there hugs"

I had misoprostol prescribed both times I went to try and get it inserted. I didn't feel the misoprostol at all (I had no side effects). In the end I ended up not getting it, because I didn't think I could handle another poking and prodding.  I did dose up with a LOT of ibuprofen (like 1200mg, I think) so I didn't have a whole lot of pain. I mostly ended up crying because the pressure and the awkwardness of the whole situation.

It was awful.  Second time was successful, I took oral cytotec the night before and morning of, which is the drug that dilates your cervix and makes it easier to insert the IUD. I had no cramping with it. I don't know if it is any different if it is administered vaginally. They also gave me valium to calm me down more.  The cramps this time were bearable and I didn't pass out. I did feel faint at the end of it but I think the cytotec helped immensely."

This made me laugh as usually one person leads when dancing whereas in Karate I assume it's both people fighting each other.  The guide seems fine, a bit over simplistic and as many guides go there are going to be lots and lots of exceptions. I like the body acceptance bit for women who might be self conscious about getting head.  The ones I noticed? Girls not giving a fig for having their labia massaged.. Girls not being able to deal with being both fingered and licked at once. Girls not liking direct pressure on their G spot. Girls who don't need a magical experience every time they want some (Although this guide is probably only for the first time.. still..).. Girls who can't handle ANY suction on their clit.   Also:   If a girl ever stops you while you’re going down on her and says something like, “You got me so hot. I can’t wait any longer. Put it in me now,” there’s a 65 percent chance she’s really saying, “You suck. Let’s hurry up and fuck and get this disappointing charade over with.”    Should not be there.

It's clearly a psychosomatic nose itch, because as soon as I'm untied it mysteriously vanishes)   We have tried rough sex. It's been very satisfying (although the other kinds of sex have been satisfying too just different). But it didn't change anything in terms of actually having an orgasm....

So far I've had no problems with it. I was under the impression that they are basically the same though my doctor back home (US) told me that the European IUDs last longer than the ones used in the US. I think it was up to 8 or 10 years (Europe) versus 5 years (US) but I don't remember specifically. I also talked to her beforehand about getting an IUD and doing it in Spain since it was so much cheaper. She didn't express any concerns.  EDIT: I'm not sure why there is a difference in duration between the US and Europe but I was also under the impression that it's due more to norms than differences in the device."
TwoXSex,3cbjnn,theguiri,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"Hi :)  I can't really say anything about the IUDs in other countries but I'm from Germany and have got the Gynefix inserted last year. Just in case you didn't know, it's not like the Paragard (i.e. it is not T-shaped), but instead it is a little copper chain and is not only inserted but the end is ""knotted"" in your cervix walls. (I hope what I'm saying makes sense, I'm not really good at talking about this in English). So I'd say it's quite a bit different than the ""normal"" IUDs. Nonetheless I'm really happy with it so far. In any case, IUDs are quite a common method of contraception in Western Europe, so most gynaecologists should be familiar with them. As far as I know there aren't any fundamental differences between the IUDs in the different countries (apart from the name and the company that makes them). Therefore I don't think that doctors should have a problem examining whether it still sits in the correct spot, etc. I hope I could help you, good luck with your studies in the Netherlands!"
TwoXSex,3cbjnn,Little_princess_xo,0,Sat Jul 11 09:28:35 2015 UTC,"I have the paragard IUD. Located in California, USA. It lasts 8-10 years. It is copper and non hormonal. The mirena IUD is also available here which does contain hormones and only lasts 5 years as the other user may have been referring to.   I've had the copper IUD for about 3 1/2 months. So far so good. Pretty intense cramps. Spotting in between periods first 2 months a little. Sometimes a little bit more sore tummy. But it's pretty much smooth sailing at this point. I'd recommend it so far.  I assume most doctors would be able to tell if your IUD had shift no matter what. When they check mine they have both felt for strings (I assume your IUD would have strings as well) or given me a vaginal ultrasound and you can see a white line on the screen chilling in your cervix so they know it's there. So as long as you have healthcare no matter where you are I'm sure having an IUD from another place won't matter. Also bringing in some information on your particular IUD wouldn't hurt if you're in a new place as I'm sure doctors realize there are many."

TwoXSex,3bto9i,Certifiedpoocleaner,-1,Fri Jul 3 01:25:08 2015 UTC,"""Wife swapping"" always meant something very specific, whereas ""swinging"", ""group sex"", and ""orgy"" tended to be far more vague and carried their own connotations and implications. Similarly, there is a difference between a ""threesome"" (a single instance of three people having sex), a ""ménage à trois"" (three people living together as part of their relationship), and a ""love triangle"" (various implications, often alluding to scandal or tension)... but these differences are often lost in the judgmental discourse heard in our society.

There's nothing she can do to change it, so it doesn't matter to him.  But don't tell him anything unless he asks. If he doesn't ask, you don't have to tell. It's okay. It's not lying.

I realize this is a less mature way of processing the honesty, but if the past is the past, then why in the heck bring it up? ESPECIALLY any kind of explicit details.

TwoXSex,3bsvny,zbignew,0,Thu Jul 2 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"He wishes he had some of those experiences, but he also needs to be more comfortable with someone before he gets intimate. He has been the impediment to him satisfying his curiosity, not you. And there's no problem with that. You haven't described anything that would lead to you ending up devastated down the road.  If your concern is that he will be jealous of your previous partners, the only thing you can do is minimize how much you tell him. You don't have to lie and you don't have to volunteer. But many guys don't have a problem with that at all.   In this case, if you have specific interests and you expect bringing them up to imply all kinds of history, (""So... how did you discover that you can only get off while wearing a fursuit?"") then I suggest toys. Buy new, related toys, and tell him about your experience with those inanimate objects. If he's one of those dudes jealous of toys, send him back to the factory.  If your concern is that he will be jealous of you, and jealous that you've managed to do all these exciting things he has never done... can't you kindof fix that? Or is this, like, multiple partner stuff that you two are swearing off for marriage? What could he want that would mean you wouldn't want to be with him?  Whatever your concern is, make sure he understands that your primary sexual interest is him. And make sure that's true for yourself, too."

When sharing your past, do not include identities of the guys involved. And do not rate or compare the experiences to ones with your SO. Also, How likely is it that he will run into guys from your past?   If he has sexual itches that he wants to scratch that you can't satisfy, what options are you comfortable with? Be clear in your thoughts on these and communicate them as needed.   Your man sounds mature and caring and you two seem to be in love, which conquers all. So good communication and empathy should guide you through.   On the flip side: I know a guy (with a similar mindset/background) who eventually came to the conclusion that his hang ups about intimacy were stupid. He also did not like that he had much less experience than his GF and figured that he could have more fun as a single guy. He broke off the relationship and committed himself to playing the field and ended up happier for it."

TwoXSex,3bsvny,Blankenfeld,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:00:05 2015 UTC,"You really need to be sensitive about this because you're going to be challenging some of his basic assumptions about people. A person who has abstained from sexual activity for as long as your fiancé has undoubtedly believes it is wrong or some variation of that sentiment. You're clearly a good person that he trusts, and so once he discovers your past he's going to begin to realize that a lot of his assumptions about sexual activity were incorrect. If someone he has found to be a good person shows him that a normal decent person can engage in healthy sexual activity without being morally corrupt or whatever he will have to reexamine more than just his own sexual history, but also, the source of the information that led him to believe whatever he subscribed to that caused him to avoid experimenting.   As a man, I can tell you that it would be hard for me to hear of a giant imbalance between myself and my partner's past experiences for the exact same reason you stated. I would be a little jealous and curious about what I might have missed out on.   The worst thing you could possibly do under these circumstances would be to allow him to find out about your past in a haphazard way. I would want you to be very open with me, but I wouldn't want you to be too reassuring because then I would feel, rightly or wrongly, that you perceived me as limited or unenlightened. Don't leave anything to his imagination. Also, if sharing this information ruins your relationship you just have to accept that. You love him very much and you want to be honest with him and you should be, but there is no way to control his reaction."
TwoXSex,3bry2j,trythrowagain,6,Wed Jul 1 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience when I used to take the pill, which was super obvious to me when I got to the highest dose of the tri-level type I was taking. My male doctor at the time completely dismissed me and recommended a psyche consult, but the nurse took me aside afterwards and said the same thing had happened to her and got me an appointment with another doctor. After switching to another type of pill that had a dose between the low and medium one of the tri-cyclic version all month long, the symptoms were not nearly as bad and I felt comfortable waiting long enough to see if they would subside completely, which for me they did. There are other options available too though, so I definitely suggest discussing this with your healthcare team. Not wanting to be pregnant shouldn't mean physical and emotional discomfort all the time."
TwoXSex,3bry2j,Pixiepup,4,Wed Jul 1 19:21:59 2015 UTC,That's absolutely long enough to side effects to appear and not long enough for them to subside. The last time I went on the pill I had side effects within a few days. I think it's usually recommended that you stay on a hormonal birth control method for one or three months (I haven't been on hbc for a long time and don't remember which; maybe someone else will chime in) to see if the side effects subside. You should talk to your doctor to determine whether the side effects are bad enough to stop now.  There are non-hormonal methods of birth control you might consider if you find that you don't tolerate hormonal birth control well.
TwoXSex,3bry2j,dirtypenpal,2,Wed Jul 1 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of women try multiple types of pills before finding one that fits with their chemistry. The first one I went on completely killed my sex drive. Another one made me so sad and depressed that I could barely leave the house. I've had a couple of friends tell me they've felt like different people on the pill.  I think a 3 month trial is common, but if you're having such adverse effects, I would just stop right away. I stopped the one that made me depressed after a week and immediately felt better.   Talk to your doctor and hopefully you can find one that works better for you. Don't lose hope!"

How can I imagine getting into it, and then eventually maybe try it out? Well. I think firstly you actually have to be turned on by it. You have to want it, like it. It's like trying to get into bdsm, you have to be interested. But also, my partner and I have a safeword (just like in bdsm relationships... Although to some degree you could argue our relationship is a bdsm relationship), so if it does get to be too much, I can stop him. But mostly, it takes lots and lots of communication, and a slow build up. So that you're both on the same page, and you're both absolutely clear about how it's going and how the other is feeling.

TwoXSex,3bgom5,LevyWife,3,Mon Jun 29 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Sex revolves around communication. It's really important to talk and discuss what you and your partner's likes and dislikes are.  As for me, my partner and I talked about it, then once he started to spank me and pull my hair, it just went from there. He knows that I love doing doggy-style because it's an easier spanking position and he's able to go much faster and harder. When I'm on top, he will literally grab my jaw and press his fingers really hard against my throat... there's so much adrenaline that the pain feels really good. I feel really desired and wanted.

TwoXSex,3bgom5,dreamin_of_florida,2,Mon Jun 29 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"I'm into all aspects of rough sex, but I'll talk specifically about what you're asking.  For me, being fucked hard and fast just feels better. There's more stimulation for me, and I personally can orgasm through PIV so it usually makes those organs more intense. My partner LOVES fucking me hard and fast so I also gain pleasure from knowing how much he's enjoying it.   I don't tense up from rough sex because my partner and i ease into it and he doesn't just pound me right off the bat. Sometimes it hurts a little, but it usually just hurts the outside of me where I'm getting pounded. If it hurts inside I usually have him slow down a little, because that kind of pain does not feel good.  I've never had problems with vagnismus before, so I unfortunately can't offer much advice there. Just take it slow, as I said, and make sure you're properly warmed up and have some lube on hand.   You definitely don't have to get into rough sex if you don't want to, but if you do i recommend starting off slow and building up to rougher stuff through multiple sexual encounters with your partner. If you jump right into being pounded really hard, it's not going to feel good. Make sure you communicate, and if the pain is too much then please let your partner know. You shouldn't have to endure anything that's overly painful to you, even if you're having rough sex."
TwoXSex,3bgom5,sweetbeeps,2,Mon Jun 29 04:03:15 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you have had conversations with your current partner about your pelvic floor? One of the characteristics of vaginismus/hypertonic pelvic floor is that there is a pain/tension positive feedback loop. The anticipation of pain creates tension, the tension creates pain, which causes more tension. Although you have a milder version, the pain of rougher sex might be enough to introduce more tension. Then again, you might be fine. So really, part of this should also be talking to your partner and making sure he knows that if you say slow down or stop, it means RIGHT NOW, not four strokes from now, so that you can avoid hurting yourself (or even him).  That being said, are you aware that there is treatment? There are physiotherapists that specialize in helping women to relax their pelvic floors. You might even figure out what some of your ""triggers"" are (e.g., sleeping poorly, certain exercises/activities, or even engaging in sex during certain times of day might be more problematic). A physiotherapist can also help you develop more conscious control of your pelvic floor and when things get tight you can do exercises to make the muscles relax.  Of course, the cost of therapy might be a bit prohibitive, but if you can afford it, it's the type of therapy where you learn the skills and get to practice them for a lifetime and keep yourself healthy and in control (which is a nice feeling).  Hope everything goes great. Also, listen to your body and listen to yourself. If you are interested in doing this because you want to explore yourself sexually, because you feel you have a great partner that you trust enough to try this with, because you feel you are ready in your process of healing to try new things, then great. But if you are doing this because you think it's what other people want from you or because you feel this is what a good girlfriend should want, then you might run into more trouble."

Relaxing into some good oral is a good mood setter as well. Even giving him a blow job while he grabs my hair or talks dirty can start to get me ready for it. If I'm wet enough and turned on enough, rough sex doesn't hurt during (but I can't go forever in length), I may hurt for a day or two after. I find I need to do it regularly enough (minimum 2x per week) to be ""in shape"" enough for it to not be sore. But the most important point for getting over my vaginismus is really never try to do it when you're not into it - it's too hard to relax those tight muscles! At those times, though, I try to be involved (hVe him jack off while touching my boobs/ass, fucking my boobs,  me blowing him if I'm up for it, or even just letting him cum on me without my participation). This way we both get what we want- I don't feel guilty for leaving him hanging (which can lead to resentment) and his satisfied."
TwoXSex,3bgom5,Altostratus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:04:35 2015 UTC,"I love it, but like some other ladies mentioned, only after I'm warmed up. Usually my partner will eat me out until orgasm, and then put his dick in slowly, and go at a slower/normal pace for a bit until it's not so tight, and then move to going hard and fast. There are some positions where he goes a bit too deep, since I am small and he has a large penis, and he will hit my cervix. Depending on how low my cervix is that day (based on periods, etc.), it will either hurt or feel really great. If it hurts I just stop him and he goes just as fast, but just not quite as deep, or we switch positions. Sometimes it just feels really nice! It depends on the person, and for me, the time during my cycle, etc. But I really like hard, fast fucking because it feels like a different kind of sexy. Like, slower fucking is more passionate in a love sort of way, but faster and harder is more passionate in a lust sort of way. My partner and I quite like both! But, it isn't for everyone, and that's okay!   I think it is really important that you start slow at first and let your vagina relax some and loosen up before you switch to hard fucking. Also make sure that it's a gradual change! That way if it starts to get a little too hard or fast you can easily ask your partner to dial it back some. If he goes instantly from slow to fast in just a couple thrusts it's way more likely to hurt or be uncomfortable, and it doesn't allow you to find a speed you really like. Good luck!"
TwoXSex,3bgom5,SexyPizzaChick,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"Joining the ""only after warmed up"" train. It's less about lubrication, which my body is pretty generous with, and more about everything else - when fully warmed up, contact with my cervix actually feels nice to me. All the rest of the time it feels like a hammer is being applied to sensitive inner tissue and AGH AGH STOP.   Also, it's not an always thing because some times no matter how warmed up I am my vagina is not interested in cooperating, full stop.  (interestingly often those are times I find the coital alignment technique particularly helpful)"

TwoXSex,3bgom5,ACatWalksIntoABar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:33:26 2015 UTC,I guess what's happening with me is he's hitting my cervix but instead of hurting it's feels super awesome. Sometimes it hurts and sometimes it both hurts and feels good simultaneously. Maybe it's like the walls of my vagina aren't super sensitive so the best way to feel something is through hitting the cervix (still don't know if that's right) super hard and fast.

Obviously, having sex will involve being able to put something inside you. A typical reason for having trouble doing so is tension.  Try to relax and see if you can get a finger in. If so, try two, then three. The treatments for vaginismus might help you. For example, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus or http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/vaginismus-causes-symptoms-treatments#3"
TwoXSex,3bdwf8,rhinosoaring,2,Sun Jun 28 11:23:05 2015 UTC,"Vaginismus:       Vaginismus, sometimes anglicized vaginism, is the physical or psychological condition that affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons or menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations (pap tests). This is presumed to be the result of an involuntary vaginal muscle spasm, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration—including sexual intercourse—painful or impossible. While there is a lack of evidence to definitively identify which muscle is responsible for the spasm, the pubococcygeus muscle, sometimes referred to as the ""PC muscle"", is most often suggested. Other muscles such as the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles have also been suggested.

TwoXSex,3bdprx,throwyerselfaway,8,Sun Jun 28 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"You need to be comfortable and relaxed. If you're tense, it won't be good. It really shouldn't hurt and you shouldn't bleed. It may be uncomfortable or weird, but there shouldn't be pain. It can hurt if you're too tense or not ready.   You'll probably start with making out and then moving on to taking off some clothes.  Oral is good here. He should be taking this time to warm you up with fingers or some oral.   The actual sex part? Missionary is the pinnacle of vanilla sex, but it's standard for a reason. For this position, you'll lie on your back and he'll be on top of you. When you're ready, you'll have your legs spread (you can wrap them around his torso a bit) and he'll start to slide it in. Go slow. It shouldn't be painful. He'll start thrusting and moving it in and out. You can grind up against him if you'd like. If he's doing something you don't like, speak up and let him know. Similarly, if he's doing something you do like, let him know. The first time will probably be relatively short and awkward, and that's okay"

Looking back on it somethings I would of done differently:  Had more time (was during church)  Been in a bed (was a car)  Less public place (was a parking lot)  More foreplay; as I learned later oral really helps with lubrication as someone else said (see #1)  Lube  I don't think I can really give you a idea on what to expect physical because Im a guy.

(it just never is)   I just feel sad that it's this way and wish there was another solution available. I'm okay with having sex without orgasms,  since the sex itself is enjoyable.

Even if they are just separated and still living together - I'm assuming that's why they are still around one another in such an intimate way? But that's just me.  I think it depends on your personal boundaries, some are cool with that kind of thing, many aren't, it's up to you to decide what you're okay with or not. But if you want my 2 cents: that isn't healthy behavior and to many that would bring up major red flags about not only a lack of respect for you but also that the relationship isn't all that done yet. Exes can be slippery slopes, especially when you're still around them constantly - which isn't why they should stay clothed, as if being naked will make them tumble over the edge, but it's already tough enough. If they are really splitting up I just can't see a reason why they should need to continue being naked around one another if they are heading toward divorce."

TwoXSex,3arat9,jjolteon,3,Mon Jun 22 21:42:07 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, you should probably see a gynecologist about your discharge/seeming infection. If your gyno tells you to brush it off, see if you can find another doctor for a second opinion. Every woman is different, so maybe it's your normal, but if it's enough to cause you discomfort then it's enough to look into.  As for sex, it's tough to know when you've orgasmed. When I first started having sex, I had heard so much hype about orgasms that I was sure I wasn't having any. But as I continued having sex I started to notice and appreciate the different types and levels of intensities that orgasms come in. They don't all feel the same. They come in shades, kind of. So yes, some were intense and mind-boggling, seeming to match the descriptions I'd heard so often. Some were more subtle, but still very pleasurable. Sometimes I wouldn't orgasm, but would still thoroughly enjoy the sensations and my partner's pleasure. So, it may just be an experience thing. The more experiences you have, especially if you experience a variety of partners, the more you may grow to appreciate different ways your body experiences pleasure and recognize orgasms when you have them.  Also, I'm not sure if this fits for you, but I find I'm way more sensitive when I'm already turned on. It's totally true that the mind is the strongest pleasure organ. Just sticking a hand down there doesn't do all that much for me, although I can feel something. If there's been a bit of kissing/touching first, or if I've been thinking of sex a lot, then I'm physically more sensitive and experience stronger sensations. Have you tried watching porn? It's not for everyone, but personally, I find that visual stimulation greatly intensifies the experience.  Good luck and happy sexin!"

TwoXSex,3arat9,sunbuns,3,Tue Jun 23 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend really spending some time masturbating. Start out really lightly. Experiment with different ways of touching yourself.  As for how sex feels, that is a pretty good description of how sex felt for me when I started doing it. Not only did it feel like I had to pee but it also felt a little like I had to poo! Not terribly fun. I would recommend you and your SO go slower (and if he speeds up and it feels uncomfortable, keep slowing him down). If he is big, tell him not to go all the way in right away. Do some partial thrusts. Then he can slowly over time go further and further in.  When you're on top, you're totally in control. Take time in that position to really experiment with what feels good (or even just different). I know it's really easy to give up and just do what feels good for him, but that's not fair! And you don't want him to get used to that.  Edit: also wanted to add that I also feel a bit numb in the clit sometimes. Like I feel horny but touching it does so little. This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but go at the clit veryyyy lightly. Maybe only touch the very top of the clitoral hood. If that gets you more horny, then you can start giving more pressure. But take it just a little at a time."
TwoXSex,3amnf5,Chocolate_Muscle,3,Sun Jun 21 18:49:47 2015 UTC,I think there was an other girl near the start who didn't even know it was porn until she was on the plane.     Many of the ads seem to be phrased to sound like modeling - bikini shoots.  I think there's something wrong if they won't be upfront with the women they hire. Every person should know exactly what they are getting into before agreeing to anything.
TwoXSex,3amnf5,noodleworm,15,Mon Jun 22 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a good representation of the amateur porn industry. I'm pretty porn-critical, and I think this was a great segueway into people wanting to do more research on the porn industry as a whole. I found it to be moralistic, but more about the women's morals. At one point, Ava talks about the coercion of young women who ""fall into"" pornography. Most of my male friends were squeamish when watching it; they felt uncomfortable watching porn after watching the doc, and that's what it's supposed to do."

I agree with most of your points, and the movie has made me change my porn viewing habits, but porn abstinence is not a realistic option for me (I imagine this is true for most men with internet access). For better or worse, porn is an important part of my sexual life. After watching Hot Girls Wanted, I can't watch most porn with a clear conscience. It's ethically suspect at best. Now I only seek out porn that is made by people who are clearly producing it themselves and enjoying it. This definitely excludes most porn, but it's not terribly hard to find."

Does the idea of being penetrated by anything, a tampon, your finger, etc, make you uncomfortable? It might be worthwhile to experiment using a lubricant and seeing if you can insert a tampon when you're less dry. You can also try a variety of positions like sitting or lying down to find what makes you most comfortable."

TwoXSex,3am4d4,cookiesANDsalsa,4,Sun Jun 21 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"I've had this problem before (still do sometimes) and one thing I've found to be helpful is meditating, especially before sex. Even if you get distracted at first, taking a little time to just let your thoughts come and go without focusing on them will teach you to live in the moment and not worry about all those other things that pop up.   Take five minutes to sit in a comfy spot and just be aware of how you feel and your surroundings. If you find your mind drifting, gently redirect your focus onto your breath. The more practice, the better you'll become at being present and saving your worries for a more convenient time! It may feel and sound silly at first, but it may help and its free!"
TwoXSex,3am4d4,thegyps,3,Sun Jun 21 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like there are also issues with how you feel about yourself. I tend to be like you, but having a partner that is open and comfortable helps. Talk to your partner about what he likes and doesn't like. You may be surprised that the things you are worried about are the very things that would turn him on. And if not, you can at least talk about what fears and inhibitions you share so that you can troubleshoot and he can be supportive if they occur. More fear equals less fun, and trust me, you want the fun. Also, I think this is one benefit of aging that people don't talk about. You just get used to yourself. Be open to trying new things and it gets easier."

A few commented on it, I said ""yeah its just a thing, havent bothered removing it"" and they didnt ever bring it up again.   OP... this thing has magnified into something huge in your head. But its not. Its really not. At worst, it is a flaw, just like EVERYONE has in some form or another. It doesnt mean you are less, or that you will be judged for it.   Its just a thing.   Dont fight your perceptions of this part of your body. Just... let them go. They're not true, they dont apply, they are nothing but thoughts.   You are a whole person, flawed and beautiful and fragile and strong. Accept what your body gives you, every day, and be grateful for being able to experience this life with it."

Everyone has body issues or something that they are shy or embarrassed about but that most people wouldn't look twice at.  Regarding the new boyfriend - just be open and honest with him. if you're not comfortable with something he wants to try (involving your butt or otherwise), speak up. I know this is easier said than done, but it's crucial in a new relationship."

TwoXSex,3ak8zr,p_iynx,7,Sun Jun 21 00:56:41 2015 UTC,"Guy here;  Something about every ladies butt hole is unique!  The fact that a lady is letting me play there is always a crazy turn on. So when a lady trusts me enough to play there and be allowed to see something she is embarrassed of,,,,  well now,,,,,, even more turned on! As far as butt holes go, it's not about the looks, it's about the trust of playing in such a protected place, it's special. The turn on, It's even more attractive if a lady deals with her uniqueness with confidence! All to say, don't change a thing, just be healthy and flaunt what you got!"

I mean, I can say with all honesty that I'd not be stoked to look at ANYONE'S butthole. Its where poop comes out! Yeesh. That word alone... butthole. Butt. Hole. I dunno. Not fun. Anyway, I would think you could get a skin tag removed by a dermatologist if its bothering you that much. Even if its not about someone else seeing it maybe you would just feel heaps better knowing its not there? Even if we are all our own beautiful creatures and all that (and we are!) it sucks to be stressed about something like that. Speak up to your partner, see what they say and just be open about things. Maybe you'll feel better and care way less just having talked about it!"

I drank often and a lot. My lady regions were entirely dry and kind of shut down if I had drank in the past two days due to dehydration. When I first started drinking, being drunk made me horny. After a few years it kind of did the opposite.

I can't hold anything and my fingers are uncooperative. Same with my legs, they usually tighten around my partner. It's just what feels right.  The leg cramps, you need more potassium, eat a banana. You can also flex your leg where you feel the cramp to get it to stop.   Sex and orgasms should be fun, giggle away.  Ugh, this shit. Yeah, too much sensation on it and it kills it. Too little sensation and I'm left wanting more. The only thing I've found to kind of work is practice. Figure out your body. Keep exploring it. You're going through a lot of changes with your transition so your body is going to react in new ways."

Tell him you would like to see a gyno and that it's not because you are sexually active or that you are wanting to head that direction. Tell him you want to see the doc about your period and leave it at that. He should be good with this.
TwoXSex,3a8b1o,LydiasBits,19,Thu Jun 18 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take this a different direction, ask to see a dermatologist. It is a skin condition yes? A good dermatologist will inspect every area of your body and take care of concerning spots, they can probably even treat your feet also. If this is something which was spread from feet to genital area, then I am sure it is something they can take care of, I mean they can take care of some STDs too, but it's a way of getting it treated without having to go through that talk if your don't think your father will be supportive."
TwoXSex,3a8b1o,Zarula,12,Thu Jun 18 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I think you could simply say ""I don't want to make you think I'm sexually active because I'm not, but I need to see a gynecologist.""  Perhaps write it in a note or text since it may be awkward. Maybe look up a doctor ahead of time (ask friends' mothers for recommendations or maybe ask your regular doctor).

There is a cream for genital warts that your doctor can prescribe, but a GP or dermatologist can do it to - I had it prescribed by my GP once for a wart that was on my foot (after trying many different treatments, it was the only thing that worked). You could just tell your dad that you need to go to the doctor to get a wart checked out, which is true. You can probably avoid the issue of discussing whether or not you are sexually active altogether."

If not, ask a female adult that you trust.  Even if you tell him that you're not sexually active, a father may come to an irrational fear that you may have been raped, every parent's nightmare.

And that's what makes other forms of birth control -- IUDs, implants like Nexplanon, NuvaRing, etc. -- so useful. Your gynecologist is regurgitating outdated and debunked information (assuming you're in the US, the Dalkon Shield has been off the market for DECADES), and needlessly hurting your reproductive health/control in the process, which really grinds my gears. Here's an article about it. Sorry to sit in my internet armchair and call a doctor wrong, but them's the breaks. Definitely get a second opinion!

You definitely need a second opinion on the IUD; your doctor is giving you outdated and incorrect information!   Depending on what pill you are on, there is a difference between taking a pill ""late"" and entirely missing a pill. Many oral contraceptives don't require you to use a back up method with a ""late"" pill -- you will want to check the instructions on your specific pill.   Clearly this is weighing on you birth, so I highly recommend looking into a more long-acting method of contraception like IUDs, implants, depo (the shot), or even nuva rings.   Good luck!"
TwoXSex,39vwez,andthecrash,8,Mon Jun 15 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"When I took the pill I had an alarm on my phone to take it and my boyfriend had an alarm on his phone for 5 minutes after that. I'd try and text him ""took pill!"" and if I didn't he'd text me ""pill?"" and if a couple minutes went by he'd call. Having two sets of eyes on the issue helped with not missing pills and made it feel more like a shared responsibility.  BUT I think a second opinion from a different gyno is a good idea."

TwoXSex,39vwez,aphesis,3,Mon Jun 15 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"My university health center's gyno office highly recommends IUD's to their patients (mostly 18-24 year olds), as some students do have issues with staying on schedule and most don't plan on having children for a few years. The Snickers commercial, ""Not going anywhere for a while?"" comes to mind. I've had mine for 2.5 years (Mirena) and love not worrying about periods or efficacy.  As a pharmacist, I'd like to point out factors you may or may not be able to control - schedules, diarrhea, vomiting, weight gain, or other medications that can alter the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.  Injections, implants, and IUDs are more reliable in this aspect, but require more work to obtain or discontinue. In the end, it's your body, so research what risks you're willing to consider, costs, benefits, and conveniences work for your situation. The Planned Parenthood site has a lot of great information on picking something that works for your needs."

She can't say enough good things about it and stated ""It's 2015, a woman shouldn't even be having a period unless she wants to have a baby because there are so many ways we can stop it safely.""   I'm not worried about contraception because my husband has had a vasectomy, but just the prospect of lighter periods or stopping them altogether is enough for me to give it a go for a year before trying a more invasive surgical procedure. But, my point is, my doctor is a HUGE fan of IUDs for her patients, whether it's Mirena or copper. Your doctor needs to update her thinking, I think."

It made me feel pregnant, basically, nausea and sensitive abdomen, and caused pain during intercourse. Had to get antibiotics and have the IUD removed, got better in a few days. It was a little scary but a few years later and after switching doctors I was cleared for another IUD. My doctor had advised me that it was still safe for me to have an IUD a few years after, but I decided to go off of birth control completely instead for unrelated reasons."

The implant is what I have and even though it made me crazy for a few weeks it was totally worth it. There's also the injection if you don't mind needles. Tell your gyno that you're having problems taking your pill on time and you want to change. They should respect your wishes!    To be honest though, you might be being a little harsh on yourself re: the pill. You don't have to take it at exactly the same time every day, it's just recommended for safety and to help your routine. The chances of getting pregnant because your timing fluctuated by a few hours  are vanishingly tiny."

There are lots of people out there who hate taking pills. So there have been other options developed."
TwoXSex,39vwez,clover3k,3,Mon Jun 15 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"There's loads of good advice here. I wanted to add that I'm on the mini pill (Zelleta) and it allows me 12 hours to take a missed pill before it is ineffective (I know this varies for different pills, this is the mini pill that stops you ovulating, which not all do. Also I'm in the UK so it might be different if you're in the US). This means if I forget to take it in the morning I can usually take it after work so long as it's fairly soon after work. Also, some of my friends used to carry theirs in their handbags and have a phone alarm so where ever they were at, say 6pm, they could take it.  I agree with what lots of others have said that your doctor is not necessarily right. There are lots of different contraception options so there should be other ones you can look into. In the UK we have injections and implants which would be another longer-term option. I know it can be really hard to find the right contraception and I have also had doctors dismiss my concerns and wants (I don't really like being on the mini-pill as I don't like not having a period, but the last doctor I mentioned this to just said 'Most women would be happy not to have a period' and dismissed it.).  Finally, I think you need to talk to your boyfriend about his attitude a bit. I can see where he's coming from but I think that's really unfair on you. It's not like you are choosing not to take it on time. Contraception responsibility unfortunately is falls heavily on women and he should be grateful that you are willing to take the pill in order to allow you both not to use condoms. I think many men don't realise the side effects and difficulties of taking the pill/hormonal contraception. I'm not commenting on your relationship, by the way, I'm sure he's a great boyfriend in many ways but I know that my boyfriend was quite unaware of the issues women face around contraception until I enlightened him. Men just don't usually have to think about it."

It's more effective and so nice not having to remember to take a pill every day. Research on your own to determine whether or not you are comfortable with one and to find out if any risks are worth it. Personally, it seemed to me (especially since I was getting migraines with an aura on my old BC pills) that IUDs were less risky than hormonal pills.   For now, I can recommend what I did. Do you have a purse that is usually always with you? If I left my BC at home, I knew I would somehow not be there when I needed to take it, no matter what time of the day I was leaving without it. E.g., if I left early in the day thinking I'd be back by the time I'd have to take it, I'm sure something unexpected would come up that would have prevented me from taking it. For this reason, I kept it in my purse al the time because I knew I'd always have that with me - at home, at work, out shopping, etc. If I went anywhere that I wouldn't have my purse, it'd go in my or my boyfriend's (if I was with him) pocket.  I also set 2 alarms - one on my phone that was vibrate-only in case I was somewhere where an alarm couldn't be going off, and then I also wear a FitBit, and you can set alarms on that that vibrates so that was useful too! Actually, I also signed up for alerts from Bedsider, so they'd text me every day at 7pm too. This was a nice backup in case I accidentally turned the alarm off.   I was pretty good at taking it, but if my boyfriend noticed it was 7pm, or even thought about it after, he'd ask/remind me about my pill. It's nice if you can get your bf on board with reminding you. Even maybe see if he's willing to set an alarm on his phone too so he can remind you - at least until you start remembering on your own."

Having it in the bedroom instead of the bathroom may help? If it's not next to me when my alarm goes off, there's more of a chance I'll be like ""I'll get it in a sec"" and then totally forget."

IUDs have been regarded as perfectly safe for a very long time, and have been gaining popularity for years now for reasons just like yours. You're bad at remembering to take your pill and need something really reliable to feel protected. You're trying to be responsible and your doctor is telling you some outdated crap. There are also other long-term birth control options besides IUDs, like the implant or the shot, that could also help you. It's possible that there are other issues in your medical history that might affect what methods would be more suitable for you, but a doctor who says that IUDs aren't safe these days simply doesn't know what they're talking about, so you definitely need to talk to someone else."

Nothing to remember, no worries about always having it with me, remembering to set an alarm, etc.  The insertion took some doing (3 doctors appointments!) but it's so worth it to not have to worry about birth control for 3 years!  The shot is also an option, but if the implant starts driving you nuts or you don't like it for some reason, you can take it out and the hormones are gone.  Once you get the shot, you can't take it out and have to let it wear off on your own.  A friend of mine had 3 months of bleeding with PMS-level emotion. Not good."

I think I took the pack out and then put it back in my purse without taking it. Engage your boyfriend in the process. Have him text you at the same time or remind you since you're both involved.

An IUD is the most hands-off contraceptive out there, and is most likely appropriate for you.  I know it's hard to ""fire"" a doctor, because we're conditioned to look up to them unquestioningly, but for your long-term piece of mind, you need to.  I am going to totally stick my nose in your bidness too and suggest you look for a certified nurse-midwife.  They're not just for pregnancies; they do whole-woman care just the same as OB/GYNs, but my experience has been that they are much more woman-positive in general.  A good midwife (and a good doctor) will sit with you and discuss your birth control options and help you make a choice that's right for your situation.  If you want to have kids in the far future, finding a provider now with whom you feel comfortable--and who has up-to-date, preferably evidence based information available--will make pregnancy much easier whenever you do get there."

Your cycle needs to be predictable and regular, and you need to be willing to be safe rather than sorry and use condoms or abstinence in abundance when it's not a ""safe day""  I recommend reading Taking charge of your fertility before you start. and I also recomend using the symptom tracking method, Grab yourself a high quality BBT thermometer and learn how to track Cervical mucus and Cervical position. Grab yourself some tracking software (I used Kindara) or a pen and paper  and be vigilant!  I also used my sponge tampons soaked in vinegar and lemon juice solutions to both restore my vagina Ph and has a mild spermacide effect which boosts the effectiveness of FAM. (vaginal Ph is vital to me, I have chronic candidiasis and it causes my vulvodynia to flare too)  I have Vulvodynia which in turn lead to vaginismus because pain was causing me to tense. I've had it for 8 years now and been in various treatments for 5 of those years and I'm doing really well. None of my research has suggested any link with HBC and Vaginismus, but you do you, Just do you safety.   Lots of people here are suggesting a diaphragm. As someone who has vaginismus who has tried that, I don't recommend it as a go-tp method, But I do highly recommend a Copper IUD, I have a T380A which will last me 10 years, I don't even notice it 99% of the time, the other 1% is when I'm checking the strings, which is easy to do because I'm supposed to be doing daily dilation exercises in my vagina anyway."

Now, coming off of hormonal birth control has the potential to cause abnormal ovulation that is less predictable, thus, more likely to fail.  For at least a month or two,I would utilize a barrier method (or a nonhormonal IUD) while tracking to see where your cycle is at and get the hang of tracking.  You can have an LH surge without ovulating, as another mentioned, and if you have any underlying reproductive/hormonal/endocrine issues, that can further muddy the waters of when/if you ovulate."

A 6% conception rate per woman-year for women who used nothing other than that method wouldn't be surprising, given that they will not all be using it diligently.  The numbers probably are not comparable but for the BBT (Basal Body Temperature) method one source gives 0.3% failure rate for the method itself, and 3.1% as an average achieved by a random bunch of ordinary people.   Since you have a demonstrated ability to keep track of data and a good knowledge of your cycle's stability, and being more mature you should achieve a great deal better than average results.  The ovulation monitors detect the LH pulse in urine, telling you that ovulation is likely in the next day or two.  This is great for planning to have a baby but another poster has said it is not reliable for contraception as ovulation may happen later instead.

I know it sounds completely embarrassing to do so, but their expertise is what you need here.

Being not super sex experienced I haven't totally eliminated the ick-factor in swallowing semen, so I sometimes gag a little bit and I just wonder if my body then interprets what I just consumed as being something it should eliminate. But then what really confuses me is that it didn't happen with my last partner, when I was even more inexperienced.  Anyway. Yeah.

Perhaps after speaking to a gastroenterologist you can talk to a sex positive psychologist to address any  sexual anxiety you might be having?   Only other thing I can think of is maybe he's got some bacteria on his junk that is triggering the diarrhea. Everybody's skin flora is different so maybe he's got something you aren't used to.

TwoXSex,39m49a,terrifiedsleeptwitch,5,Sat Jun 13 11:40:11 2015 UTC,Semen has a lot of prostaglandins which could be causing your issues. Why this is happening with your current bf only is unclear to me but he may just have different chemistry so to speak.   You could see if your GI can prescribe something like Lomotil it is pretty good at preventing exogenous prostaglandin triggered diarrhea.

Finally, some people just can’t digest semen. It could be the fact that it’s alkaline, or the proteins it contains, but for some people, swallowing semen results in stomach aches & nausea (this is kind of like an intolerance as apposed to an allergy). There generally not much your doctor can do about this - although feel free to talk to them if you’d like more information - so the easiest way to solve the problem is simply to not swallow. You can either refrain from giving oral, use a condom to catch your partner’s semen, or spit (& before you ask, no, spitters aren’t quitters, they’re just people who don’t want to swallow, ok?)."

TwoXSex,394jio,DamnLadyBits,2,Tue Jun 9 05:17:51 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I have yeast infections that mainly stick to my clitoral/labia area, so even without discharge it could be a yeast infection.  I've also had a vaginal yeast infection with little discharge so I assumed it was a std but my doc ran a smear under a microscope which confirmed it was yeast.  My clit does get sore after to much masturbation, but it's never hurt to pee before. It could be a uti, sometimes people get mildly uncomfortable ones that they don't even bother getting checked for a week or two, personally I'll go from fine to unable-to-stand in under an hour.  You really should ask a doctor instead of us, planned parenthood has sliding scale costs and payment plans.

TwoXSex,394jio,inflammatoryjustice,2,Tue Jun 9 08:30:54 2015 UTC,"This sounds a LOT like a UTI or bacterial infection. The pain of them can come and go, but it is likely caused (and worsened) by all the self love. Your clitoris is pretty damn close to your urethral opening so yeah being a bit rough with yourself can get bacteria in there (this is why you should also ALWAYS pee right after sex).     Take a break from touching yourself, drink plenty of water and pee as often as you need to. If this doesn't fix it then go and see a doctor - don't put it off cuz if the infection spreads to your bladder or kidneys you will be in for a really shitty time. Sadly after you've had a UTI once you do become more prone to them, so make sure your fingers and such are clean before you get down with yourself, and maybe be a bit more gentle!"

TwoXSex,394jio,p_iynx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"What you're describing sounds like it could be Vulvodynia. It's basically burning nerve pain around your clit that can feel very deep, or can feel like your labia is torn, or probably other sensations. Nerve pain is very individual. When I'm having a bad pain week (especially before/during my period; my entire vulva will feel bruised and burning) ice or heat can help. Sometimes Epsom salt baths are immediately very soothing, and the Magnesium in the salt does wonders for pain for longer-term. :)   It could also be a microtear or even just raw skin. I would recommend getting Virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil for masturbation. If you use toys, just make sure that the material is safe for use with the coconut oil (oil based lubricants can break down certain materials that toys and even condoms are made from). Coconut oil makes your skin more moisturized (and therefore a little more elastic), reduces ""bad"" friction/skin damage, is an anti-fungal (and fights yeast infections) and anti-bacterial. If you do have a microtear it can keep it from getting infected or tearing further.   I would take a couple days' break from the self-loving, slather on coconut oil to fight any infection or yeast, and drink lots of water to flush out a possible UTI. :) Make sure you're drying thoroughly after showers/baths and avoid using scented soaps in your vaginal area."
TwoXSex,394jio,skylightpirate,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:57:57 2015 UTC,"The urge to urinate more and burning is very UTI. Infections can be recurrent. It's possible that rough masturbation could result in bacteria from your hands/toys ect resulting in an STI - it's known that sex can cause UTIs due to agitation of the urethra. Masturbating probably helped your symptoms go away because sexual pleasure shuts off a lot of unpleasant things in our brains.  If you're getting chills and worse symptoms, I would suggest seeing a doctor ASAP. UTIs are relatively harmless, unless they develop in to bladder and kidney infections. Best to be safe than sorry?"

TwoXSex,38n1qk,Sarilia,12,Fri Jun 5 07:28:10 2015 UTC,"It's a little gross, but you can avoid dealing with the actual poop as much as possible.  A condom on a toy (or penis) makes it much easier to start cleanup.  Baby wipes and a plastic bag that you can tie up and dispose of afterward are good for the rest.  Make sure you've pooped beforehand. I don't have any good tips on timing that, unfortunately.  Your diet in the day or so leading up to it will also be a factor.  Enemas are an option, ideally, again, after pooping."

TwoXSex,38n1qk,Barneyk,11,Sun Jun 7 01:34:27 2015 UTC,"Just another point about the anal-sex thing, most people I have been with who really enjoy anal-sex does not like the in-and-out motion very much.  Instead, slide in, keep it in and sort of thrust and push. No in and out friction.  Now that is not what you are asking about, but it can be a very nice thing to try.  And it will also help a bit with what you are asking about, with less in-and-out going on back there there is less risk for something from deeper in getting out.  Under normal circumstances, poop only really exists pretty deep inside the butt."
TwoXSex,38n1qk,ljpegging,3,Fri Jun 5 13:02:28 2015 UTC,Those are actually useful tips and not something I had heard or thought about. So I'll happily consider your advice. :)
TwoXSex,38n1qk,baurette,6,Fri Jun 5 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"Hello. I'm a dude who's into pegging, so I have a bit of experience in this arena.  First. Poop first. Lots of fiber. A salad the day before would help.  Second. Enema. Go buy a fleet enema at walmart, empty out the saline, get in the shower, and fill it with warm water. Put it in, squeeze it in, then squeeze it out of your butt. Keep going until what comes out looks like clean water.  Congrats - you're ready for butt stuff!"
TwoXSex,38n1qk,baurette,4,Sat Jun 6 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"these are overall tips, based on how I got over any issues, not rules:     No morning anal  Baby wipes or wet wipes in the bathroom, make it a habit.  Shower after poop if you think you'll do it later on the day.   In the shower reaaallly get free and loose while washing, like have fun with it actually, just waaash and wash, let the water flow.  short cut: have a gay friend to go with you to a farmacy and pick up a douche. Do that in the shower. It holds up until like +- 8hs.    And always remember, condoms are friends not faux.    ps: what nobody will tell you on this go for it mood, is that there are after effects. I'm sorry, but it might burn when you go to the bathroom after, and in my case I had diarrea while my butt hole couldn't even do pff. This happens still a little, sored hole and poop weird. Butt all in all, I'm still the one asking for it."
TwoXSex,38n1qk,cottonchampion,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:35:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the warning. I'm not sure whether it makes me feel better about the prospect of anal or not, but I suppose I won't know until I try.  We already keep wipes in the bathroom and bedroom since they sometimes come in handy after sexytimes, so I'm ahead there.  I'm curious on 2 things though that I didn't quite get. Why no morning anal? And why would I have a gay friend go with me to the pharmacy to pick up a douche? Is it because they might have some expertise on the subject that someone else wouldn't?"
TwoXSex,38n1qk,asheneyed,2,Fri Jun 5 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on bowel movements, but usually by morning you'd have saved up and accumulated some stuff on your large intestines that could be making their way into your rectal canal. (same goes for the 8hs duration of the douche, after that no guarantees)  A gay friend was because they tought me everything on anal sex regarding cleaningness. Most girlfriends just focus on pain and etc.... they tought me how to clean and find pleasure.    That was more just overall talking, it doesn't have to be gay, or someone at all, neither a real farmacy - you can just google and buy online. But, for me it was much more accessible to talk to a friend than to do the other, each to its own. Again just tips.    And real talk, once you have it and you desire to have it again, after a while it'll be part of your sexlife (in the frequency you choose), no steps will be needed, or planning, but you were specific on the poop factor, so I hope this shed some light on the options."

TwoXSex,38n1qk,cant-Google-this,5,Fri Jun 5 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we do it occasionally and I have to plan for it,  and when I do I use an enema a while before hand and spend some time in the bathroom. Fleet Enema (super cheap at drug store) with lukewarm water (dump the solution that's in there, you don't want to use it because it is for constipation and makes you go)  until it comes out clear,  wipe with wet wipes,  then the a good shower and really cleanse. Also,  having a lot of fiber in your diet ensures solid bowel movements that don't leave stuff trapped inside. Using this method,  as long as I plan ahead and we bring plenty of lube to the party,  it all goes smoothly and cleanly! The very end of your anatomy before the anus typically doesn't store poop,  especially if you are regular. And btw,  you really should always use condoms for Anal,  due to bacteria and other yuck. And that makes it way easier,  becsuse he can just slip the condom off afterward and maybe do a little wet wipe action,  and you're all good to go for other activities. Alternatively,  she could use a smaller toy on the back door and let him handle the vaginal,  at least to start,  to get you more comfortable with it and to ease you into a full size penis. You really need to start with finger insertion, (they make finger condoms!) then a small plug,  and maybe work your way up to bigger toys so you can relax and get used to the feeling. Doing lots of extra butt hygiene is definitely off putting at first,  but if you like the sex,  you'll find a way to grow accustomed to it.  Congrats on your triad! As a bisexual,  I approve :)"
TwoXSex,38n1qk,Dizzidrop,2,Fri Jun 5 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be starting with a finger, yes. I don't know that I will run out and buy a butt plug, but I do have a glass dildo that is bigger around than a finger, but smaller than a penis. It's my favorite toy, and I hate to contaminate it with butt, but with a condom over it it should be fine.  And really, using a condom for the actual sex makes sense. In fact, I think it sounds a lot less nasty than doing it bareback. I might have to see if I can find some of those finger condoms.  Having an enema sounds a little unpleasant, but I suppose I'd give it a try at least once. I already get lots of fiber though. I like my whole grains :p  The bacteria and stuff is really what grosses me. Not just the visible poop. I didn't know that there was a span of the intestines that was usually poop free, though I'm sure it's not free of residue and bacteria. Some of this, though, is a psychological barrier for me.  Anyways, thanks for the info and advice! ^.^"
TwoXSex,38n1qk,EkmekVeKahve,2,Fri Jun 5 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"Glass toys are easy to sanitize so that's great! Might be better to use it withour a condom (with lots of lube of course) to reduce friction,  especially because it's not porous so there's no risk,  after proper cleaning and perhaps boiling as well,  of bacteria living on it. The intestines aren't poop free,  but the sphincter area isn't meant to store fecal matter,  that's the area directly inside the anus. It only has poo in it when you're using the bathroom, if you are healthy. You're right about the bacteria and stuff though,  it's certianly there. And enemas aren't so unpleasant. Lots of people like them,  actually. Make sure you read up on how to properly use one,  and don't use cold water though becsuse it can give you cramps! The finger condoms are called ""finger cots"" and they're usually by bandaid and first aid supplies.   I'm sure if you address your concerns with your partners,  they will help you have the best and  cleanest experience possible.   Good luck!"

TwoXSex,38g9sx,peachnyan,6,Thu Jun 4 03:59:56 2015 UTC,So I pee immediately after but then wipe with a regular bathroom wet wipe because we don't have a fancy bidet and I don't always want to shower right after.

Well, the cuddly zone leads to more sex. But we can't have more sex if we use condoms or toys since we just covered our bits in latex and rubber destroying oil.   And how long does the oil stay there? Will I have to go take a shower before the next round anyways just to be safe? Then what was the point in the wipe in the first place?  It's probably a decent product for people who are fluid bonded, but unless you put some serious warnings on it regarding what that coconut oil will do to condoms and toys, you are just asking for angry customers with broken toys or unwanted pregnancies."

TwoXSex,38g9sx,Altostratus,2,Thu Jun 4 22:49:58 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thank you for that! It seems a lot more sensitive skin friendly than other wipes.

TwoXSex,38g9sx,Altostratus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:54:16 2015 UTC,"most ""sex wipes"" are scented. Think summers eve.  The ingredients in that are  Water (purified), Octoxynol 9, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice, Neutresse, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Sodium Sulfite, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Potassium Sorbate  Where as a Huggies Simply Clean baby wipe  has Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Coco-Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Malic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E).  Something in the first wipe somehow throughs off the PH in a vagina which may not be true for everyone, but is true for a certain amount of women that doctors need to mention it."

My apartment sounds like my upstairs neighbors are constantly bowling and parading elephants around. I've never had an apartment this noisy before in my life. I asked my landlord about it who lived here happily for 10 years and he was just like ""oh, idk it never bothered me."" I highly value my peace and quiet. I can't wait to move out.

TwoXSex,387ifn,Equipoisonous,2,Wed Jun 3 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"There's a huge difference between constant noise and a few loud slaps/giggles/etc once a day or so. I wouldn't be able to handle constant noise either, but when my neighbors are clearly getting it on I just go to a different room to give them privacy, or turn my volume up if I'm watching something.

I am very tolerant up to the point where it's going on for over a half hour and it's essentially screaming. If it's going on, like, super loud after a certain hour I would complain to my community/apartment manager though. Then it's not just about me being annoyed, it's about noise ordinances and everyone's right for peace and quiet for a stretch of time every day."

TwoXSex,387ifn,ninasayers21,4,Wed Jun 3 06:20:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  I feel like everyone is entitled to make a certain amount of noise during sex without having to be ashamed or embarrassed about it. That amount of noise decreases with how thinly your walls are built and how likely it is to interfere with other people around you going about their business (i.e. sleeping.) However, if you're screaming like a banshee constantly, that's just rude. Nobody's sex life is that good."

In our last apartment (15 years ago now) our upstairs neighbors had a very squeaky bed. They went at it a few times a week, and their bed was right over ours...awkward. The saving grace was that it never lasted more than maybe five minutes, so when they started up we'd just turn on the radio or get a glass of water from the kitchen and it would be over.

I never got a complaint any time I've spanked my bf/gf/husband or the other way around. I think a lot of people understand sex happens, and unless you're literally screaming for hours on end every night people get over it. Loud sex noises like moaning annoy the crap out of me, but I'll understand and put up with it (until after a certain hour, that is. Then it's no different than screaming. You're keeping people awake/ruining the one peaceful stretch of time they get during the day)."

TwoXSex,3865dn,asfkjsdflkjsdflkjsdf,5,Tue Jun 2 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"You can get waxed while on your period. Just wear a vaginal cup or tampon. But, many guys are fine with hair, and a good trim is all you could need.  If you've not been diagnosed by a doctor for your itching, please see one before having sexual activity. This is a good habit to get into even when you are not experiencing any symptoms - a clean bill of sexual health should always be mandatory between any new partners. My concern is that you are experiencing a symptom that could be a couple different things (yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis) - both of which have different treatments.   When you do receive oral sex, don't feel like you have to have an orgasm and fake one. Instead, try to relax, enjoy the sensations, and provide feedback (moaning, etc.) when your partner does something pleasurable."
TwoXSex,3865dn,LilGeekieBiGrrl,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"If you do have a yeast infection you may smell bad down there, so how do you smell even after showering? Something I do if I think I could be getting a yeast infection is I cut up a few cloves of garlic and take them like pills. I've also cut half of a garlic clove and left it in my vagina overnight. I swear that cured my yeast infection the last time I was getting one. Look up garlic's effect on yeast infections. Also, try to keep your vagina dry. Change your underwear if discharge is leaving your panties wet.  For shaving, just shave in the direction the hair grows. Don't use an old razor. Get a new blade if you're in doubt. Be gentle and don't press hard. You probably won't slip. Use a unscented lotion after getting out of the shower."

Just trying to figure out if people normally have a slight itch down there. It doesn't bother me, just don't want to hurt the guy I'm hooking up with. I won't be able to see a doctor anytime soon either :/"
TwoXSex,3865dn,sunbuns,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:27:18 2015 UTC,I don't usually have itchiness. But once I had itchiness after having a yeast infection treated already. I even went to the doctor again but they said I was all clear. The itchiness didn't go away for months! You're probably all good!  And don't worry about tmi haha. Talking about vagina health involves lots of details!
TwoXSex,3865dn,LilGeekieBiGrrl,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:32:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously, google bacterial vaginosis. You can get it after treating for a yeast infection, or have it and think you have a yeast. Itching isn't normal unless something is going on down there: infection, sweat, hairs coming in after removing them, etc."
TwoXSex,3865dn,Demi_ChemE,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"Second on the vaginosis. I had bacterial vaginosis that didn't go away for about 4-5 months. It would go away for a couple weeks, then come back. It made me pretty itchy and I had a lot of white discharge. I didn't find anything that made it go away for me, besides staying clean and changing my underwear up to 4 times a day when it was at its worse.   I didn't find that oral sex made it any worse, nor did my partner have any complaints or catch anything, as long as he hadn't eaten anything sugary beforehand. To be safe, I would make sure your partner hasn't eaten for at least a couple hours beforehand, and has brushed his teeth. But not immediately beforehand, unless you want an intense menthol-like burning sensation."
TwoXSex,383zft,discussing_eye,2,Mon Jun 1 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"It's probably a minor infection/abscess type thing. Could be related to the vaginosis. Theoretically if your partner has a beard, it could have caught the skin and caused a minor cut that got infected.  I have an abscess on my groin that's just about gone down now, and there was no reason that I can see (probably shaving but I seem to be prone to them anyway). We just sort of poked it until it went down, but it's better to go to the doctor instead."

The thing is I didn't actually have 'libido' problems, you get aroused and get wet, you just can't climax. Depression had killed by libido, so I was actually pretty happy to get it back.   I think you need to explain that to your boyfriend. Plenty of women can't orgasm at all but still love sex.  'hey, sorry babe, a new medication I'm on makes it really hard for me to climax, I still really enjoy it so don't get too hung up on it Ok?""  If your relationship continues you will likely have to be open and honest with him. So try not to outright lie in the beginning. that includes making climaxing.   I guess from a male point of view its very hard for them to understand sex 'finishing' without a climax."
TwoXSex,3830kb,lets_mosey_on,4,Mon Jun 1 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Might I just suggest you use    ""why do you get so wet but don't come?""   As a start to discuss sex a bit? Because obviously he doesn't understand some things. Getting wet has zero to do with orgasming and if he thinks that I'm pretty sure there are other things he really doesn't understand.  But yea. Don't fake orgasm. A good deal of women never orgasm and can still enjoy sex a lot, but you kinda have to say it and (informally) come to a agreed upon place to stop sex. That's the most weird part about not orgasming, when to stop? Especially for a guy trying to please you, there has to be a point where you end the festivities, because if he stops at some point after he's done, he's going to feel egotistic."

I've tried many antidepressants in the past and most recently was on Paxil (horrible experience for me overall.) The whole ""unable to orgasm"" thing made me feel like I lost part of my identity. Before Paxil, when I would have some ""me time,"" I easily could have 4 or 5 orgasms. But Paxil killed that. I didn't even want to have sex anymore because it got so frustrating for me. I'm on Wellbutrin now, which is known for not causing sexual side effects, and it's doing just that for me."

I mean, how much you have been overcome with desire for them? Have you felt that whole-body ache for them? Like, you were dying for them to just touch you? Sexual chemistry is a very real thing, and pleasurable sex starts with chemistry and desire.   When I was just starting to date, I liked the first guy I dated (at 14/15) and thought he was cute, but when we kissed, it kind of grossed me out. I didn't have that deep passion for him. Zero lust. We broke up pretty quickly. It took me a while to meet someone who I just had an overwhelming desire for, and then? One touch set me on fire. Totally different experience.   So it's possible that you just haven't met the right person yet and aren't experiencing the kind of sexual chemistry necessary to get off from sex with another person."

The emotional connection, and intimacy, and his willingness to actually listen to me made it possible for me to be open about what did and didn't feel good.

I tend to focus more on how it feels on my fingers, rather than how it feels vaginally. As for the pain, I'll wait to see what other posters have to say...but I've never experienced actual pain from masturbating, and that would worry me. However, when other people have fingered me at certain angles(? i'm not sure exactly what they were doing) it has felt a little painful.

TwoXSex,37x06c,Grave_Girl,7,Sun May 31 03:07:26 2015 UTC,"You can try rubbing indirectly.  Some women are too sensitive to tolerate a right-on-the-clit touch.    Lubrication that flakes off sounds more like it might be cervical fluid; it will change at various points during your cycle, and dry/flaky is one of the nonfertile forms of CF.  It could also coincide with a low point in your hormones that I can see making you less lubricative overall and possibly making masturbation less enjoyable.  And if you are on hormonal birth control, it's quite possible (I want to say likely, but I'm not certain) that your CF would remain dry/flaky, but that shouldn't necessarily impact how pleasurable masturbation is.    Stupid question time: are you sure you're really aroused before you start with the clitoral stimulation, or is it something you go for right away?  My experience is that even masturbation needs to have a warm up period akin to foreplay, though not necessarily physical touch."
TwoXSex,37x06c,Philae_90,1 point,Sun May 31 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know, my clit isn't all that sensitive, so whether turned on or just bored, I'll usually just masturbate by rubbing it over pants, and that's usually fine, it's just when I go inside it loses enjoyableness.

I like penetration but digital penetration doesn't do anything for me anymore when I'm doing it myself. It didn't really do much for me age 7, it was just how I thought you were supposed to do it alongside rubbing the clitoris. When my fiancée does it, it's just supplementary to oral sex.  I prefer penetration by a toy but even then I prefer anal sex to vaginal. There's nothing wrong with not liking it, your tastes may change but don't worry if not.  The flaking isn't anything to worry about and the pain probably isn't anything to worry about. I haven't had a penis inside me, but it felt a lot different to use a strap on."
TwoXSex,37x06c,upsilonsphenomena,5,Sun May 31 11:28:47 2015 UTC,"I personally don't enjoy fingering. I have some vibrators I use sometimes, but otherwise, I stay external.   I've never noticed the ""juices"" flaking off my hands, but it definitely does this after drying on my toys. Not every time, but sometimes. Although this may be based on when I clean immediately vs when I just go to bed and clean them in the morning."
TwoXSex,37x06c,Escaides,2,Sun May 31 06:38:02 2015 UTC,Hmm most women don't feel much stimulation from vaginal sex anyway that's why there needs to be a lot of foreplay and kissing and stuff. I personally don't feel much when I finger myself and enjoy rubbing my clit when imasturbate so you are not alone. Try flipping over and rubbing your clit on your back or standing up or in other positions.
TwoXSex,37x06c,pm_me_ur_awesome,3,Sun May 31 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"I can only speak from my own experiences, but I was much like you before I lost my virginity in that I basically only climaxed from clitoral stimulation. I didn't like the feeling of fingering myself because I didn't like the way the inside of my vagina felt to my fingers as opposed to what my vagina itself was feeling... like my vagina felt a lot more spongy, soft and sensitive and like it should be picking up much more subtle sensations than it was. If that makes sense?  Anyways, in dramatic contrast to how fingering myself feels, I fucking LOVE PIV sex and having a partner finger me is a close second. (Depends on the partner of course.) I find the sensations when I'm with a partner to be dramatically different, so don't sweat it too much."

TwoXSex,371bcv,ex_sizequeen,17,Sat May 23 23:01:22 2015 UTC,You could wear a butt plug. Makes you feel more full by pressing on vaginal walls.
TwoXSex,371bcv,bonnerchia,18,Sun May 24 03:28:03 2015 UTC,"So first option is this: you could do what guys do when they have ""death grip"". You basically desensitize your genitals by not masturbating in the same way or having sex. Then, when you do have something in you, it feels larger just because it's been long enough that your body forgot what being filled by a larger penis feels like.   You can make sure you're getting really mentally turned on, because then it doesn't matter so much bc it's easier to orgasm.   Or you can get a toy like the We-Vibe, which you wear in/on you during sex. It presses against your g-spot and adds clit vibration an inch or two of thickness to a penis in you. :)  Good luck!"

TwoXSex,371bcv,downsouthgirl22,2,Sun May 24 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Try clitoral stimulation with PIV? Not every woman can orgasm with just penetration alone and need that extra stimulation from the clit in order to orgasm.  Personally sex feels SOOO much better when you do both.   Also something else that may work would be to change positions. I had a partner who was about the same size (~5) and I felt nothing in missionary. But when I got on top (grinding, no up and down) or did doggy, I could actually feel him and the sex was pretty good."
TwoXSex,371bcv,sexrelatedaccount,3,Tue Jun 9 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Toys could help... as well as new and exciting angles of penetration, and maybe kegels. Communicate with your partner to let him know when he's hitting the right spots."

Obviously she cares about him more than his dick. har har ""why is she here then"" Because even though she cares for him, and enjoys their sex life, she wants a some advice on how to make it better for her. Maybe someone else has had this issue before and they found a solution.   You're suggestion is to dump him because his penis isn't as big as she has enjoyed in the past. Not to mention you put in your own philosophy on your ideal woman. No one gives a cares.   Oh, so your post was downvoted because you aren't trying to help."

Instantly. So its kind of a sham isnt it?  So basically she is trying to convince herself presumably because he is a catch in other areas. Well nobody wants to be that guy. And why shouldnt he have a girl who actually likes his cock?   I did offer a solution. Fingers. I will add a tongue and toys. I am an extremely enthusiastic lover willing to do whatever. When she is left panting on the bed i promise she is not thinking about my penis size.   Sure there are positions and etc and it works for me just fine. But for her to write this post obviously it is an issue. And why should it be? There are lots of bigger dicks in the world. Go find one. Everybody has preferences. Go towards them  You dont see me writing... help my lover cant do what i need to get off how can i jerk myself off without her noticing? how dumb is that"
TwoXSex,371bcv,downsouthgirl22,6,Sun May 24 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and you were insecure at one point to right? Say you fall totally in love with the girl you described. She is fit, toned and is a tiger in bed. She is your ideal woman. But she has the same issue OP has. She likes guys that are 7 or bigger. It's acceptable for her to tell you your dick isn't big enough?   You didn't offer a solution, you said that you used fingers to get a girl off and it made you feel better about your penis. And that all works for you, why do you automatically assume that she hasn't tried oral or fingers? Maybe she prefers PIV over oral. We don't know. All we know is that she is asking for help on how to make it feel better when she is used to a bigger guy. Had you said something like,    ""I don't think it'll ever feel better. You are used to what you are used to and anything smaller won't feel he same. Maybe stick to oral or mutual masturbation to get you off. If the relationship isn't strong enough to make it on that alone, then you may have to break things off. Sorry OP   You still get your point across without being rude."
TwoXSex,371bcv,ohsnapt,-3,Sun May 24 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"The thing now, is that I am now longer in my 20s, and I don't just have to time to date just for fun or be as picky about superficial things as I used to be.   that was the reason for my snark,  haha don't do me any favours!  Whats so great about her that he should be willing to be made insecure forever? Why does he need that in his life? Of course she would never tell him this. But man thats a big one (pun intended)  I think your first paragraph contradicts me, no, nobody likes to hear that their dick isn't big enough, where did i say that?I would strongly try to avoid falling in love with someone who didn't love my cock if that info ever came to light. But if it were just a half inch like in your example, well shit we can use a bigger toy once in a while, i aint fussed ;)  the point is that everybody has dealbreakers. She is claiming that its not a big deal, but maybe it is a dealbreaker, and that's ok ! Can't believe im saying that, but really it's cool  the other important thing is this: sex is more than piv. My last lover, her previous lovers are these big rough guys as facebook informed me. Well I'm not small, but I don't exactly give off that vibe. She was at my place thinking, ""ok well sure it probably won't be so bad"" before we had sex for the first time.   But then I picked her up like a stuffed animal (she was very surprised) carried her to bed, snarled and pulled her hair. She came back for 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths! Those dudes might have had bigger dicks than me, but I didn't feel insecure because I felt we were still on the same playing field, that I could compete you know? If you can exceed someones expectations all the better, what a thrill"

TwoXSex,36scdh,sirownski,6,Thu May 21 20:39:50 2015 UTC,I have a vagina that feels small but I've never met a penis I couldn't accommodate. Vaginas are such weird stretchy muscles.

I dated a guy that was almost too long and it would hurt sometimes but he would be more conscious of it than it sounds like your guy is.  I'm also told (by my doc) that I have a longer than normal vaginal canal. Dunno if that means sex was different or better with me compared to others.... I would have to ask the exes and yeah.... No.

I know it feels good to hit something full-force with one's dick, but let's try to avoid doing that to something that's hooked up to the vagal nerve (just like one's nutsack) and produces the same physical reaction upon being rammed as ye olde testicles.

If you don't like being groped, then tell him that. But he's probably upset that you were letting him do things to you that you didn't want him to do. You need to set strict boundaries like ""you can put your head there"" or ""you can lightly touch or cup but don't pinch or squeeze"" or ""I don't want you to touch them unless we are having sex.""  But you HAVE to express this to him -- I will bet that a lot of his upset feeling has to do with feeling like he was doing inappropriate stuff which is not fair to him since you didn't tell him and then snapped at him about it."
TwoXSex,36ntaa,orthodexy,15,Wed May 20 19:55:58 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was going to say about her boyfriend.

I agree with/u/orthodexy,  just talk it out."
TwoXSex,36ntaa,rebjean,4,Wed May 20 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"I was the SAME exact way in high school! I remember posting the same question on reddit, too!  I think the biggest thing I was uncomfortable with was the abruptness of someone touching my chest.  I've always been uncomfortable about my chest for some reason, it just feels to big for me, so I think my attention was always on it.  I hated the way it felt when a boyfriend would take my bra off and start touching my nipples, they felt so oversensitive and it was just the most unpleasant feeling ever.    The key, for me, was to make sure my SO only touched them after we had been fooling around for a bit.  So, once I was more eased into it, I could relax and he could fiddle around all he wanted.  Once I got more comfortable in the bedroom, I started feeling more comfortable everywhere else.  As I became more comfortable, I was able to put it out of my mind more, I guess?  I don't know if this even helped at all, but I hope it did!  Also, my other piece of advice, is talk it out!!!! Talk to your partner about everything!!! It's so important I can't use enough exclamation marks!!!!"
TwoXSex,36ntaa,x0klly0x,2,Wed May 20 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely not crazy, definitely not even a minority I think. No one wants any body part touched all the time, and I think every woman's felt like ""okay, get over them"" at some point when a partner's touching their boobs. Plus, there's a big difference between you saying you want to try to get over something, and your boyfriend saying ""I'm going to help you get over this"" for you.  I really don't like my breasts. Anything more than a few light touches and I'm really taken out of the moment. But my husband loves them. What to do? Well, he also likes my ass, and touching that actually IS a turn-on for me. So if I can redirect him, then things are okay. Or if he can just touch my boobs in passing while touching a lot of other body parts (basically, one of many parts instead of the main part), it's okay. There are also some days here and there where I do just let him touch them, because I realize how fun for him it is. However, that's when I agree to it, and that's after building up years of trust and respect, and I'm not saying anyone has to act the same way.  So like everyone else said, it comes down to talking with him. It's also worth finding out how much of his concern is ""aw, no boobs"" and how much is ""wait, did I accidentally hurt you?"" Yes, as a straight guy he's going to be sad with less boobs in his life. That's natural. But if his concern is more for that then your well-being, that might be a sign something's amiss."
TwoXSex,36ntaa,PoniesRBitchin,3,Thu May 21 03:51:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely used to feel pretty much exactly that. But I found the longer I was with my SO, the more confident I became in myself and the less it bothered me. I also got my nipples pierced recently and that's made me really love my boob and now I really enjoy when my SO plays with them because now I love him and he loves them so it's a win-win.   You're not crazy at all for feeling that way. The biggest thing is communication. You're the one that sets the ground rules for your body and your rules are to be respected by everyone else. If you don't like your boobs being touched unless you're having sex, then that's just how it is."

Your body is your temple and you have every right to tell every person what they can and can't do to/with you. I would recommend that you apologize for the lack in communication and ask him to respect your boundaries. In the future, you might want to lean towards an ass-focused kind of man."

TwoXSex,36gx7n,mykidisonhere,1 point,Tue May 19 13:59:18 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I like feeling wanted, needed even by my partner, and seeing him willing to work for that really turns me on. But on the same page, when we're building up and his desire is so great he just takes control (respectfully, of course), that really gets me going. It's then I can feel his need, and I want to satisfy that need."
TwoXSex,36c7cb,IhrKenntMichNicht,4,Mon May 18 05:22:45 2015 UTC,A few weeks. Then my vagina gets used to it. Then we break up. Then I go months without sex. Then it hurts again...  ...Its a vicious cycle

TwoXSex,36c7cb,ShellLillian,2,Mon May 18 16:03:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's normal to have ""deep pain,"" I mean if you have vaginismus that's probably why, but if it doesn't go away in just a couple of days I would see a doctor. I've been sore after sex but it never lasts more than a day, and usually it's because we didn't use enough lube."

At it's worse, My pain after sex lasted 2 weeks, But I have been undergoing treatment and in remission for several months and now my pain only lasts a few hours or a day if the sex was a particularly long session.  It's not a matter of having more sex until it stops hurting, You also nee to be treating your vaginismus outside of sex. Dilation therapy, Relaxation therapy, Downtraining and so on should be performed every day if you are able."
TwoXSex,36alza,bitchycunt3,11,Sun May 17 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"I have this exact ""problem."" While it is not always foolproof, my boyfriend compensates by pushing in with all his might, and will generally stop thrusting during the strongest parts. He will more or less just fight against me pushing him out. As I lessen a bit, he will thrust again. Sometimes the force is just too much, but very often he can stay inside me, and LOVES the feeling on his cock. He goes crazy for the squeezing. I can come multiple times like this, and he just goes nuts for the tightening on his cock. There are contractions where it's tighter and less tight, and he does his best to work with them. Try seeing if your boyfriend can push in hard against it to stay inside, then thrust again when the orgasm subsides."

TwoXSex,36alza,ericaciliaris,3,Sun May 17 20:49:06 2015 UTC,"I do this too.  Granted every partner who this has happened with has felt some great sense of accomplishment from making me come so hard.

Not sure if that's too helpful but it's worked for me!"

But i do the same thing, I contract so hard. My ex used to stop thrusting and just grab on and push in and hold on, he said it felt amazing to feel it pulse on him. We came together many times this way.   Usually, I'd be on my back, legs on his shoulders and he would just grab my thighs or waist and push hard. I miss that..."

TwoXSex,3686mb,creamcheesefiasco,2,Sun May 17 23:59:29 2015 UTC,"I think it might be 'normal' to bleed/spot after your first 1-3 times having sex (I know I did) but after that, it shouldn't be bleeding regularly and especially not for that long. You might have a tear in your vaginal canal or you might have an infection or your cervix could be inflammed/irritated/otherwise not healthy."

TwoXSex,3686mb,AcidRose27,2,Mon May 18 01:14:21 2015 UTC,Sometimes having sex can trigger a period to start if you're not on hormonal birth control and if your period is almost about to arrive anyway... But definitely get it checked out because it's not something that should be regularly happening. Does it hurt at all?
TwoXSex,367va6,FireInTheHol3,4,Sun May 17 00:39:53 2015 UTC,"I would encourage you, sometime between now and the moment of truth, to sit down and be straight-up with him. This really isn't a huge deal and it's nothing to be ashamed of. At the same time, I could see how it would be awkward to bring it up now, and like I said it's not a huge deal, so....  My second-best advice is to tell him, when the moment arrives, that you're kinda inexperienced and very nervous for the first time with new partners, so you'd like to take it slow. I'm sure he'll oblige. As far as the bleeding/tightness, those might not be issues at all, but if you're worried about it you can stretch the hymen out yourself (slowly, with fingers or a dildo and lots of lube). It will probably be uncomfortable; if it gets painful stop where you are and wait for your body to adjust. There's no rush. (If it hurts unbearably you might want to see a doctor.)   Good luck!"
TwoXSex,367va6,Emberesque,6,Sun May 17 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"Girl,  do yourself a favour and put a finger in.  The vagina is built to accommodate a baby's head.  You will be amazed at how little you will feel."
TwoXSex,367va6,poppylicious227,1 point,Sun May 17 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"Don't tell him if you don't want to. It's your choice. Definitely stick a couple of fingers in before you get down to it, you need to know an approximation of what it will feel like. He probably won't know - or won't be absolutely sure anyway. I bled my first time but didn't experience any pain. He just assumed that I hadn't had sex in a while. The only big deal for me was being scared of intimacy - the act itself isn't rocket science, and you just automatically go with what is natural."
TwoXSex,367va6,_severin,1 point,Sun May 17 11:37:55 2015 UTC,"if i were you i would learn what it feels like to feel something inside you. telling him is the best idea, but if you really don't want to then you don't want it to be a complete shock. if you're worried and unsure and really have zero clue what to expect then i think you'll find it super hard to relax enough to enjoy it.  my advice is to learn a bit about your body in private, in a relaxed environment where you can go at your own pace (and not worry about getting down to it with him), and if it's not right then you can stop and try again tomorrow night.  so, i would start with a finger and get yourself aroused. it's it's dry then it'll never be nice, no matter how experienced you are. 1 finger, maybe a tampon. when it's nice, and feels good, then try for 2. you need to want the second one, not just pushing it in because you need to. same advice to anyone trying anal for the first time: relax, go slow, explore, experiment, and ease into it.   i would suggest buying a vibrator. you can have some amazing orgasms and learn what angles suit you best, what positions are most pleasurble and then when you are with this guy you'll feel so relaxed, turned on, comfortable and wet and you'll have, hopefully, a mind blowing first night.   but then again, what do i know, lol, i was born with one of those weird penisy things. it's a much simpler creature to master. :)"
TwoXSex,367va6,TheWizardKara,1 point,Sun May 17 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna back up most of these comments. You don't have to tell him. You can mention that ""it has been a while"" or that you ""don't do this often"" to explain the awkwardness. It is unlikely that he will be able to tell from your vagina. At 24 I wouldn't really think your hymen is intact (it often breaks or always had a large hole.) I didn't experience bleeding when I had sex with a man the first time at 18 but I did at 26 with a larger partner. So it can be explained away in an ego boosting way!   Try using a few fingers. Maybe in the shower or in a situation where you feel comfortable. And don't stress out! It's only your first time once and then it is a distant memory.   *edit:spelling"
TwoXSex,363sx1,Iamrathersensitive,8,Fri May 15 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"Guy here. I've known girls who are very similar. It's not super uncommon, especially for younger/less experienced people.  Areas that aren't used to being touched are usually more sensitive, and that sensitivity can sometimes border on pain. It sounds like you have a bit more of an extreme case. You're already doing the most important things, which are: communicating with your partner, and adjusting yourself to work around the sensitivity.  It has been my experience that sensitivity diminishes as the area becomes more accustomed to being stimulated. What this means is that it is possible - even likely - that as you continue to play with yourself and with others, the area will become less sensitive over time. This does not mean directly touch it and cause yourself pain. Usually, just doing the things you already know feel good will involve enough contact with the area to result in a lesser sensitivity over time.  If you'd like to accelerate this process, or attempt to make clitoral stimulation feel good, I'd suggest touching extremely lightly at first. If it hurts at all you're pressing too hard or too fast. Try touching and not moving at all. Try not using your fingertips, but instead something soft and clean and light which may allow for less pressure when touching: something like a Q-tip, or a pair of panties... or touch through your panties so you have some level of protection. The goal of all of this should be to find if you can stimulate the area in any way without causing yourself pain - that is, to make it feel good. Generally speaking lighter/softer/shorter duration will change a painful sensation to a pleasurable sensation, when dealing with issues of sensitivity.  Now, if the lightest, softest touch you can manage still causes pain, that may be an issue to bring up with a doctor. It may not mean there's anything wrong with you - you may have just gotten an extremely sensitive clit on the luck of the draw - but that degree of sensitivity would warrant checking out at least.  Good luck, and happy orgasms!"
TwoXSex,363sx1,kaeroku,3,Fri May 15 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! That's good advice. Thank you for your perspective :)"
TwoXSex,363sx1,p_iynx,6,Fri May 15 23:35:56 2015 UTC,I have a very sensitive clit. You aren't alone. I would try telling your partner right off the bat and telling them how you like things. The more communication the better!  I've found that pressure rather than friction is what gets me off without pain. So maybe try that!
TwoXSex,363sx1,lostsouul,1 point,Sat May 16 01:13:19 2015 UTC,Good advice! Thank you!
TwoXSex,363sx1,kaeroku,3,Sun May 17 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"Another guy here(I know we shouldn't be here):  The 'body' of the clit extends down and into you body a bit on either side of your vag, if you do a little research you can find some pics showing the layout. After ample foreplay ---> Get your partner to work on the areas leading up to the clit but not the super sensitive part. She/He will be directly stimulating the outskirts of the clit, thus getting your body more used to the touch without jumping directly to the goal. Only in the final strokes of your orgasm should YOU and ONLY YOU then reach down and feel around and experiment with touching to finish. Do this for a couple weeks and I bet you'll be heading in the right direction. Let your partner know when he/she can help. This will add to some great foreplay as a bonus!"

TwoXSex,362rn4,BringingSassyBack,5,Fri May 15 16:42:29 2015 UTC,"Try different positions. Girl on top is a good one. Once you both figure it out, you get vaginal AND clitoral stimulation. What helped for me in my last relationship is when I moved my hips forward, he would thrust too. Play around with amount of thrusting and take turns doing the movement. But then when you think you could orgasm, both of you really go for it. I don't mean go to pound town and go really hard. I just mean, make it feel really awesome for both of you. Here is why I say this: sometimes I would ask my ex to thrust, but he was just going through the motions. If I asked him to thrust like it was his turn to come, then his movements were just slightly different, he was more into it, and they were good for him and good for me."
TwoXSex,362rn4,sunbuns,1 point,Fri May 15 17:34:34 2015 UTC,Most women don't get off during vaginal penetration. Even some men can't. Totally normal.
TwoXSex,362rn4,igardenalot,3,Fri May 15 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. I can when I masturbate or he uses his fingers, etc. Just not while having sex for some reason."
TwoXSex,361ji4,mineraloil,16,Fri May 15 09:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think you should see a doctor. I disagree with those here who have said that pain with first time penetrative sex is common or normal. If everything is as it should be and you used lube, it should not be so painful that even a finger cannot enter you. It worries me too that even when it's your own finger when you do it on your own, it is painful. I have a friend who has a similar issue and she found out that she still has an intact hymen; not imperforate but with a hole so small that she cannot have penetrative sex or use tampons. So I think getting a routine pelvic exam would at least not be a bad thing for you at this point."
TwoXSex,361ji4,Jourdin,1 point,Fri May 15 16:56:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your concern! I am worried about the same. But they just don't do those kind of exams here on unmarried girls :/ but honestly, I've only tried using my own finger two-three times in my life...maybe I am just not used to it?"
TwoXSex,361ji4,Jourdin,1 point,Sat May 16 08:30:00 2015 UTC,"What? Where do you live? I hope that's not too prying. Nevermind, I saw your edit. I'd say when you go abroad, getting an exam would be a great idea. In the mean time if penetrative sex only causes you pain, just abstain from it. :)  That could be the case. Regardless, don't try to force anything. Women are perfectly capable of experiencing sexual pleasure without penetration, so maybe if after a few more (gentle) tries, it's still not working for you, you and your partner can just stick to oral and manual sex stuff. If you feel comfortable doing so, too, you can get a hand mirror and flashlight and try to look at your genitals on your own. You probably won't be able to see very far inside of yourself without a speculum, but self-exploration is never a bad idea in my opinion."

TwoXSex,361ji4,MercifulWombat,6,Sat May 16 08:30:31 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, this is common. Practice on your own when the stakes are lower. Even though you want it and you're turned on, your muscles tense up and won't let anything in, not comfortably.  I'd say to practice penetration with a smooth plastic vibrator, but it sounds like that's probably not available either.  What you've described doesn't sound like a doctor is required. It may help you relax if you try to have fun with what you can do before it hurts, and only penetrate a little more with each time you hook up. It will probably hurt a little. If you can't wait, it will hurt a lot."

TwoXSex,361ji4,derpendence,3,Sat May 16 08:32:40 2015 UTC,"My first piece of advice is relax, relax, relax. Physically feel your vaginal muscles relax. And definitely go slooowwww.  Another thing you should be aware of is vaginismus. It's when your vagina involuntarily spasms and tightens. It prevents any penetration. That's something you would need to go to the doctor for. You could tell them you can't put a tampon in or something.  There are physical causes but most of them are mental. I'm no expert though so research it yourself."

TwoXSex,361ji4,radrax,2,Sat May 16 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"Vaginismus sucks. I've been struggling with it too.   The important thing is to practice on your own. You have to really, really relax, both mentally and physically. Get as turned on as you can, go sloooow, and use lube even if you're wet. You have to stop worrying about the pain. It's kind of a catch-22 -- you're afraid of it hurting, so your muscles tighten, which makes it hurt, and it's just a vicious cycle.  If you can't get in to see a pelvic floor therapist, try isolating your pelvic floor muscles on your own. Do you know what kegels are? Instead of tightening them, you have to work on loosening them. If you don't know where/what your kegels are, try stopping your pee in the middle of the flow. Those are the muscles.   The way you work on loosening them is by doing the same muscle movement you do when you start peeing. Breathing in also pushes the muscles down. Try inhaling while pretending you're peeing, if that makes sense.   What I have done that has really helped was buying a dilator set. You start with a really small one and work your way up to the size of the average penis. In literally one day I went from ""so tight I can't even put a tampon in"" to almost getting the third size all the way in (not the biggest, but the one below it). I like the vibrating one because it kind of numbs your muscles, and you almost don't feel it going in, so it goes in really easily!  Sorry for the super long message, but I hope that helps!!!!  Edit: stop immediately if it hurts! Don't feel like you have to/are supposed to just ""push through it."" It will absolutely not help. Sex is never supposed to be painful, and you'll just make it worse the next time you try penetration because you'll be expecting pain, which again, makes you nervous and even tighter."
TwoXSex,361ji4,radrax,1 point,Sat May 16 05:40:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes you are right - I need to practice on my own and learn how to relax. Everytime it would start hurting, I would clench up.   And yes I stopped when it was hurting. Thank you! <3"
TwoXSex,361ji4,BluewaffleFTW,1 point,Sat May 16 08:38:02 2015 UTC,"I will say ditto on the dilators. Using them with plenty of lubricant has really helped me. I'm still partway through the process myself, but it gets easier with each time I work on it."
TwoXSex,362j41,squidtossaway,20,Fri May 15 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes it's really a thing. A penis can be too big it's uncomfortable. Vaginas aren't this sizeless infinite cavern that are hunting for the biggest thing they can get inside them. It's a body, and bodies have limits. Just accept that she's having great sex with you and she obviously likes it. She was honest with you when you asked, don't make her regret being honest."
TwoXSex,362j41,OvaryQuiver,10,Fri May 15 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"If a penis is too big, it may hit the woman's cervix. For some women, yes, it is painful and unpleasant."
TwoXSex,362j41,lalalalands,4,Fri May 15 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Length is pretty much useless at some point cause if it's too long it can hit the cervix which usually hurts. Thickness is much more important in my opinion.

If you take a look on a few of the kink boards or fetlife you'll probably find someone willing. Just remember that this means you have to play the part of a woman, and I don't mean externally."
TwoXSex,361rwf,skylightpirate,2,Fri May 15 11:13:58 2015 UTC,"SSRIs nuke my sex drive.  They used to make me feel like there was no point in even masturbating, it would take so long with such little payoff.  If you can't deal with that as a side effect, other options include switching to a different medication category (ie. SNRIs, tricyclics, atypicals) or different strategy (ie. counseling, group therapy, self-help books).  Some people have reported success with Wellbutrin, although I'm unsure if they're simply adding it onto their existing prescription or switching entirely to Wellbutrin.  Increased sex drive is one of the many potential side effects of Wellbutrin.  Although a fair word of warning, the only side effects it gave me were night terrors and restless leg syndrome."

I've been having extreme digestive problems for months so I got worried, heh, tbh I'll get it checked at with my gyno if it keeps up in a month or so. But your and another person's comments help to reassure me."
TwoXSex,360oc7,sheets9954,1 point,Fri May 15 05:54:04 2015 UTC,6 months of nothing and now I have a very light period every once in a while.
TwoXSex,360oc7,sheets9954,1 point,Fri May 15 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"Truth. But ""every once in a while"" is different from an abrupt stoppage like mine... hm, but I suppose that if someone can suddenly start having normal-ish periods again on the Mirena, the reverse can become true."
TwoXSex,360oc7,lapis-lazuli,1 point,Fri May 15 05:53:13 2015 UTC,"Mine aren't on a set schedule or anything.  It's a bit annoying, after 6 months of not worrying, to now having to carry liners with me all the time"
TwoXSex,360oc7,DangerousLilly,1 point,Fri May 15 06:35:59 2015 UTC,"I got a Mirena IUD inserted a few months ago, and was told over and over again by nurses that it will usually throw your cycle out of whack and make it lighter, and eventually stop your period altogether. Congratulations, you've successfully stopped Shark Week! This is totally normal and absolutely nothing to worry about at all."
