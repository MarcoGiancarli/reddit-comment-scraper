Sense8,3e3pxl,TinyCuts,3,Tue Jul 21 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"Though doesn't it seem like theyre the kinda black sheep fuckups of the family? I mean the uncle is living in a MANSION with multiple security guard detail, and in flashbacks Wolfgang's dad's apartment looked so shitty. Plus the way the cousin Steiner was being so obnoxious and calling Wolfgang/Felix ""just"" petty criminals. So while they're all part of the same crime family, there's a definite heiarchy at work too."
Sense8,3e3pxl,empress-of-blandings,6,Tue Jul 21 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"And why did Wolfgang's uncle have a thing about choosing between his son and Wolfgang?   Wolfgang and Felix stole diamonds from the same person Wolfgang's cousin Steiner planned to steal them from. Steiner had not kept it a secret, so Wolfgang and Felix knew exactly what they were doing and looked forward to the frustration it would cause Steiner.  Sergei, Wolfgang's uncle and Steiner's father, supports Steiner, but recognizes that he owes some familial consideration to Wolfgang."

They're all the same age because I'm pretty sure Jonas said something about a cluster always takes their first breath in unison.   I think it was someone on this sub who mentioned a theory I realllllyy liked about the birth sequence, which was that due to Nomi being born via c-section rather than at a natural later date, it forced all of the others to begin their birth earlier than they were ""supposed"" to since they all have to be born together. Which explains why so many of the births seem to happen in random places (back of police car, cemetery, middle of soap opera, etc)."
Sense8,3e1dfe,empress-of-blandings,11,Tue Jul 21 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, hey, that's pretty sharp. I like it :D"
Sense8,3e1dfe,hino_rei,10,Tue Jul 21 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"While this is a great theory I hadn't considered, I'll give you my perspective. Each birth was representative of each of their lives. A lot of them are more obvious than others, but some of them go deeper than what I see people discuss. Spoilers follow.   Wolfgang's is the one I can't dig too deep into. He was water birthed which accounts for his comfort within the baths, but past that I can't see much else.  Capheus was born from humble beginnings. In the heartland of Africa. A simple life has given him a simple view of the world. He is quite a lighthearted individual, and one could argue he's the happiest of the sensate. That being said, he also seems to have had the hardest life of the sensate.  Kala was born while it was raining, and if we assume it was during the Monsoon season, I'm pretty sure this is considered lucky within the Indian culture. Born under the eyes of a proud Ganesha, her roots within tradition and religion are pretty substantial, not even being phased by her career in science and the steady march of modernization. Too often do people denounce religion, seeing it as a way to control, hurt, or destroy. Yet that is not what it is supposed to be about. Her childhood scene at the festival was my favorite. When you look through the eyes of a god, what do you see? Your people, your children, celebrating, dancing, and having fun. That's what religion is supposed to be.   Riley's is my favorite. Surrounded by music at the time of her birth, but more than that, surrounded by so much love. The love between the father and mother is almost tangible. It is this love between these two people that brought forth such a gift of a child. This loved continued on which helped Riley gain confidence and self-worth giving her the necessary mentality to heed the warning and leave Iceland to lead a life away solo.   One could make the argument that Lito's birth was unexpected and happened during a special telenovela. Yet for me it was very representative of Lito's problems. His family was more concerned about the image, rather than the person being born right in front of them. Just as Lito was so concerned about his image, rather than being his true gay person.   Will's birth, though unexpected, or perhaps too early, fits perfectly. Born in the back of a police car, born by the badge, and he will die by the badge. Only now, the badge is of the sensate. Will is the image of what ""real cops"" should be like. What the police force is meant to be, not what it is. Filled with leadership, determination, not just a sense of justice, but a sense of what's right.   Sun's birth was also unexpected, but the location of it, I feel, was just a heavy handed foreshadowing to her mother's unexpected death (though I don't know if it could be called foreshadowing since we knew about it already).  Nomi's birth was the most interesting for me because I still can't decide which theory of mine I like best. At first I figured her birth was cold and (literally) calculated. This is a good parallel for her relationship with her mother. However after watching the series a second time, I have a different theory. Her mom, is at once both old fashioned and too far ahead. Her mom doesn't love her any less than a normal mother would. Sure her mother doesn't respect her MTF transformation, but that's her old fashioned view, I can't quite dislike her for it. Assuming Nomi's mother loves Nomi as much as she says, the c-section could also be seen as another form of love. C-sections can cause problems, but they seem to solve more problems than they create. As Nomi's family seems wealthy I don't see why they wouldn't spend as much as they could to ensure their childs safety, it's just done in a way we're not accustomed to and seen as cold and negative, much in the same way we view her mother's opinions. While your theory is based on Nomi being born too early, I saw her being born just on time. That is, since she was born via c-section, her birth was planned. Just as there is a plan for the sensate, and all of us. To quote a certain wizard, no one is born early, they are born precisely when they mean to."
Sense8,3e1dfe,SerCiddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:01 2015 UTC,We don't see much of Lito's family. Maybe he tries to get the love/attention of his family by being on TV?. Might explain his reticence to jeopardize his career.

Sense8,3e1dfe,pinkmankid,7,Tue Jul 21 09:20:03 2015 UTC,"August 8 is revealed in the show, but not the year of birth.  Just learned in an FB group, that according to trivia section of IMDB Lito's family were watching the final episode of Cuna des Lobos, Mexico's most popular ever soap opera at the moment he was born, and that the final episode aired in 1987.  The scene with Wolfgang becoming friends with Felix as teenager in Berlin I would put mid to late 90s, Wolfgang was resented because he came from East-Germany, Felix has a discman on the desk.  I would have said they were born more in the first half of the 80s, but okay, 1987 or maybe even 1988 could work."

Sense8,3e33zk,myfriendm,5,Tue Jul 21 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Not weird at all that the sister was never mentioned or seen again. Heck, her mom wasn't seen again until a very short shot in that birth scene.  Chances are, she was committed, had MRI scans to make sure everything's okay in her noggin', and when found out, she was moved to the evil intensive care ward.  And I think it is safe to assume that Metzger was lying. Had her mother not committed her into the hospital, the corporation would have criminalized her much the same way as what happened after her escape.   Her mother, of course, believes that she's doing what's best for him despite her obvious disapproval of her lifestyle. And maybe even believes that this is what's wrong with her, and that maybe she could be fixed and go back to being Michael."

Sense8,3e33zk,RMC91,3,Tue Jul 21 21:07:57 2015 UTC,I don't see anything odd about the sister being there. Presumably the sister would have been the one to take Nomi home but once the doctor saw the mri results they presumably called for parents to be there to discuss a course of action.  I know in writing there has to be a point to a  character or object or scene or whatever but I think the sister being there was there because in reality family would be there.

Sense8,3e092y,nacreous,11,Tue Jul 21 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think it was intentional, and that some of it is meant to be realistic. For instance, HIV is still very common in Kenya, it might look like a stereotype to have Capheus's mother have HIV but given their location it's not terribly unlikely. If they wanted to give his mother a disease that would create motivation, HIV was a good bet considering their location.   I think one big point of the show is to have these characters from different countries and cultures come together. It almost makes sense for the characters to be stereotypes (to an extent) of their countries' populations. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable. None of the eight main characters are particularly bad people (at least when we see things from their perspective) and they have things about them that make them stand out more as individuals as well, so I personally don't think it is a problem. It was definitely noticeable for me too though."
Sense8,3e092y,cozypear,8,Mon Jul 20 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth on this issue.  The answer to your title question is: yes, absolutely. There are many stereotypes in the series, some far more questionable than others.   I don't think it's offensive to show a lesbian couple in San Fransisco going to a pride march, since lots of lesbians do live there and are heavily involved in the queer scene. Lana Wachowski is particularly qualified to show us the experiences of a white trans woman living in America, and is therefore less likely to delve into murky waters for Nomi. As a queer woman myself, I didn't see anything that made me feel uneasy in her storyline.  However, I'm not as certain about what they've done with some of the others, Sun and Capheus in particular (Lito a little bit too). Their stories go deeper than the stereotypes, and they're sympathetic characters with real agency, so I credit JMS and the Wachowskis for that. But the creators are still white Americans who can't help but put a white American lens on what they produce.  Does good characterization make it less sketchy that their Asian character is an inscrutable martial artist? Or that their Kenyan character is always sunny and optimistic in the face of violence? And why did they choose to leave these two characters in particular out of any sexual or romantic subplots and scenes?  It's worth examining, no matter their intentions (and I believe their intentions are positive).  There are a variety of reasons they probably called upon stereotypes in the show. Calling back to genre tropes helps orient audiences who aren't familiar with the real life settings. For instance, even if you don't know the political climate of Mumbai, you've probably seen at least a clip or two of a Bollywood movie. The creators know that American audiences will have an easier time connecting to the stories we expect from those places, so they put in things like Bollywood dance scenes, familiar Hindu deities, and a plot that centers around a marriage.  And when they subvert the stereotypes they set up, it's always pretty fantastic. For example, you expect Kala to be in an arranged marriage, but she's not. Some people are so used to seeing that story for Indian characters that they completely miss the fact that it's not arranged. I want more subversions like this. More unexpected twists on familiar tropes.  I guess in the end, I don't feel qualified to say whether Sense8 uses these stereotypes skillfully or not. I'm not Kenyan, I'm not Korean, I'm not Mexican or Spanish or Indian. I can't watch the show with a critical eye on the depictions of those countries and their cultures because I know so little about them.   I'm very fond of simplicity in story allowing for complexity in character, and this is what I've seen in Sense8. I'm glad to have show with this much diversity. I believe they go beyond the stereotypes, but I hope they continue to go deeper as the show goes on. To do even better.  I'd also like to link to this article, which is an interesting take on this topic. It raises some legitimate concerns, even if I don't agree with everything, and it's absolutely worth reading:  http://thenerdsofcolor.org/2015/06/10/sense8-and-the-failure-of-global-imagination/"
Sense8,3e092y,fullmoonhermit,4,Tue Jul 21 04:40:49 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with some stereotypical tropes.  On one level they can seem lazy, but remember they have a total of 12 episodes to introduce us to EIGHT main Characters (plus some important supporting characters) with an entire plot line dedicated to each, plus the over arching sense8 plot. Some ""shortcuts"" need to be taken (that's just how effective storytelling works sometimes), but none of the characters is flat.  I think the writers (and actors!) did an excellent job making them fully human and very intentionally and effectively subverting some of those sterotypes at times.  :)"
Sense8,3e092y,davidtoc,4,Tue Jul 21 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"My problem with that critique, is that there is rarely a show with this diverse a cast, and so it would make sense to seize all those opportunities to tackle issues like HIV medication being impossible to access, lgbt intercommunity conflicts, as well as external threats to the lgbt community, police vs impoverished African Americans, patriarchal Cultures, etc.    I think that the word Stereotypes doesn't work for me for this, I would use the word Archetypes. Those characters are archetypes, whose initially perceptible traits are informed by the global zeitgeist and societal problems.  The word stereotypes would work, if the lesbians were rude to the male characters, and worked as carpenters.   I don't know that I've ever seen a transexual woman, hacker/hero character in another show.   While I have seen an African/HIV trope before, I definitely have never seen a Kenyan bus driver with a strange obsession with Jean Claude Van Dam.    Also, an Icelandic DJ, a female who is damaged emotionally but not because she was raped, which sadly is a common trope in Cinema TV.  Also not something you see every day.  Cop guy, yeah maybe not a stereo type but a common hero character in film/TV obviously, but come on you gotta have one.   I dunno I could go on, but now I'm done taking a shit so I gotta get back to work.   TL/DR:  They ain't stereo types, they are archetypal characters with traits informed by societal shit goin on, which makes sense cuz if you're gonna have a show about global human connectedness, and community, you would miss a real opportunity without making them a truly diverse group of characters.   Nobody complains about heterosexual white people being stereotypes in every movie ever. Well, reddit probably complains..."
Sense8,3e092y,squall113,4,Tue Jul 21 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"They aren't unrealistic stereotypes though. Every one of those archetypal characters exists abundantly in real life. Lots of lesbians in San Fran, lots of people with HIV in Kenya, and lots of Indian women forced into arranged marriages when they are in love with someone else, etc."
Sense8,3e092y,beeUnit,6,Tue Jul 21 00:19:22 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought Kala wasn't forced into the marriage, and she was one of the first in her family to marry for ""love"", even though she didn't love him really, however she felt pressure to marry the guy because he's so perfect a match on paper, that it made her family (who she loves) so happy to see her with him.  ??"
Sense8,3e092y,squall113,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. Very much so.  But it does not bother me. Because of the sprawling narrative it's pretty much essential. And it leads to greatness, because simplicity is power.  It may be problematic in a sociological sense or whatever, but looked at as a piece of fiction, distillation will always be a awesome as hell.  Good taste does not seem to be a major priority, which is fine with me."
Sense8,3e092y,MrCaul,2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"While I like the idea of subverting the stereotypes, I think that one of the weakest parts of the show is that four episode stretch in the beginning where the characters haven't been fleshed out and the sci-fi element hasn't been explained. I think the show takes so long to kick into gear that it probably alienates a lot of viewers before it can really showcase how truly wonderful the characters are."
Sense8,3e092y,hybbprqag,3,Tue Jul 21 04:47:39 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it is more of an homage to a style of film.
Sense8,3e092y,iiowyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:59 2015 UTC,"I'm with those saying it was intentional. Yes, the characters/storylines are stereotyped, but that's not the point. The point is that everyday people, from such disparate locations and cultures that they may as well be worlds apart, empathize with one another. Normally they'd live their whole lives without encountering or even being aware of each other's existence. Stereotyped characters/storylines actually work better in this instance; the idea is more believable, relevant, and relatable. Besides, there is more than enough originality and freshness without having to overcomplicate the characters."
Sense8,3dxrpb,krokenlochen,8,Mon Jul 20 12:16:09 2015 UTC,Looks like a Lamy.
Sense8,3dxrpb,bob_in_the_west,6,Mon Jul 20 12:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely a Safari"
Sense8,3dxrpb,bob_in_the_west,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:09 2015 UTC,I remember my first lamy.
Sense8,3dxrpb,GhostShipBlue,3,Mon Jul 20 14:14:02 2015 UTC,I still carry mine! Several of my kids have Safaris as well.
Sense8,3dxrpb,ozzyssey,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:47 2015 UTC,It actually looks like the aluminum AL-Star. ;)
Sense8,3dxrpb,GhostShipBlue,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:42 2015 UTC,AL-Star   I disagree. The Al-Star doesn't have the bevel around the ink window.
Sense8,3dxrpb,GhostShipBlue,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"And how did THIS, of all things, get to be a thing?"
Sense8,3dxrpb,ozzyssey,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:57 2015 UTC,It looks a lot like this one. http://www.gouletpens.com/lmy-l28/p/LMY-L28
Sense8,3dxrpb,Sleesama,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:46 2015 UTC,That was the fountain pen I had when we were forced to have them in secondary school... I remember the flip you could do with them if you stood them upright and dropped them on their lid though.
Sense8,3dxrpb,stop_yelling,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:09 2015 UTC,Uh.. why?
Sense8,3dxrpb,GhostShipBlue,7,Mon Jul 20 14:32:35 2015 UTC,It's a pen geek thing. You rarely see fountain pens and for those of us who carry them it's cool to see someone using them. Especially in a show we really dig.
Sense8,3dxrpb,overlander37,2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:33 2015 UTC,I thought i was the only one!
