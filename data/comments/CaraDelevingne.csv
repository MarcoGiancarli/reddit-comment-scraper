CaraDelevingne,3dq1pn,waitasecondminute,8,Sat Jul 18 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Cara says she felt confused by her sexuality as a child, and the possibility of being gay frightened her. “It took me a long time to accept the idea, until I first fell in love with a girl at 20 and recognized that I had to accept it,” she explains. “But I have erotic dreams only about men. I had one two nights ago where I went up to a guy in the back of a VW minivan, with a bunch of his friends around him, and pretty much jumped him.” Her parents seem to think girls are just a phase for Cara, and they may be correct. “Women are what completely inspire me, and they have also been my downfall. I have only been hurt by women, my mother first of all.  “The thing is,” she continues, “if I ever found a guy I could fall in love with, I’d want to marry him and have his children. And that scares me to death because I think I’m a whole bunch of crazy, and I always worry that a guy will walk away once he really, truly knows me.”   http://www.vogue.com/13268025/cara-delevingne-actress-july-2015-cover/"
CaraDelevingne,3dq1pn,MrTuxedoMan,5,Sat Jul 18 13:37:18 2015 UTC,I don't think she's defined her sexual orientation. I don't think she's straight though. Probably bi.
CaraDelevingne,3dq1pn,dj_roombaaaaa,5,Sat Jul 18 09:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive she is bi, in an interview she described herself as ""just having fun"" while she was young"
