It's evident when you say things like ""This UX simplifies the drivers experience."" How? It's largely based on assumptions you've made.  Where is your research? The link provided doesn't mention any explicit interaction with users, or what you may have asked them. What is the driver's #1 goal when they're driving and using the display? What about two, three, four, five? Your research leaves a lot to be desired. It's a sort of competitive analysis, which is a good start, because it's based on what''s available. But to actually say your vision is improving the user experience of the car requires that you have some user feedback, research, pain points, suggestions, etc, to go on.  You talk about taptic/haptic feedback? Where else does this apply to your design?"

Tesla has almost certainly done extensive usability testing and has a strong list of user needs they are looking to address. That doesn't mean they are right, but it does mean they have a reason for doing everything they did.  OP doesn't necessarily need to have the same amount (or any) user research to show off this design, but in order to call it UX she does need to show an understanding of what's most important to a user in the context of an automobile. That's where this falls short. The image is beautiful, but it's pure mockup, not UX."
userexperience,3e4uy9,iulius,4,Wed Jul 22 05:56:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I think this is the opposite direction the dash should be going in.  It now feels like there's more on the screen than before. Some of the text is so small it would be hard to see from a driver's typical viewing distance (ie. social notifications).  It would be better to think about what's important to a driver when they're driving. Sure, an interface the passenger can use is also great. But the default dashboard should be simple, and not feel overcrowded with information.  For example - the weather is great to know, but why do I need to know the weather for the next 4 days? I can find that out another time, I don't need to know that when driving.   I also don't need a list of my notifications on the screen. That's a huge distraction - there would be better ways of doing this, like just showing one if it comes through.  Incoming call should be way more prominent! Now THAT'S something I'd want to know.  And the sliders below the settings are cool, but pretty unclear. The difficulty with car UI is things have to be simple. People could be driving these cars out of rental places - their first experience with the UI has to be ULTRA clear.  It's a nice concept, but calling this UX focused is a bit misleading. Touchscreens in cars are pretty crazy in general, and it's a problem most companies haven't been able to solve."

userexperience,3e4uy9,tinklebear,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:59 2015 UTC,I just joined this sub and I've been seeing UX used interchangeably with UI a lot. I'm not sure what the reason is.
userexperience,3e4uy9,jlink5,0,Wed Jul 22 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"It's because of the fact that you can experience the ui. A user can experience anything. UI is at the top of the list because it's so commonly created and easy to redesign. You can find UX in products, services, and even sound!"
userexperience,3e4uy9,jlink5,3,Wed Jul 22 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah... That may be true, but that isn't really what UX means. GUI, a toy, sound, etc are all media, or the interface, FOR experiences - not the experiences themselves. When you show an image like the one OP posted, it doesn't say anything about the UX. At most, it shows what kinds of actions a user might be able to perform, but it doesn't say anything about the way they perform them, when and where they perform them, or what the goal for performing them is. That is what UX describes... The flow of actions that create a meaningful moment. UI is a tool to create UX, not the experience itself.  UX also has specific meaning in design which is different, though sometimes related to, UI."
userexperience,3e4uy9,sevennationsalami,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"It's because of the fact that you can experience the ui   That's a rather simplistic way to put it. (Don't go around holding up this notion when you're applying for a UX job).  You experience an object through the UI. The interface is a translator of the two different languages spoken by the human and that object. But the UI is not what UX is focally about, though it's definitely a vital part of the solution. The goal of UX is ""I'm having fun using this object"" and not ""I'm having fun using this object's interface"". As soon as the UI becomes invisible to the mind, that's when UX has done a great job.  If you redesigning the UI with no insight into what it's like driving a Tesla, then you have not done it with ""UX in mind""."

userexperience,3e4uy9,phpdevster,2,Wed Jul 22 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"Why is there a social media feed present on the home screen of a car that needs the driver to be paying attention to the road!? A giant touch screen is already questionable in terms of safety, but to include pointless and trivial information that the driver would need to commit time to read is frankly, irresponsible.  Tesla should have exactly two screens, both in dash behind the steering wheel:   Navigation screen Speed, battery, and other misc instrumentation. Ideally speed would be displayed in a HUD on the windshield so your eyes never need to leave the road to see your speed.   There should be no center console screen, and instead there should be a very smart, very responsive voice assistant that you can activate with a button on the steering wheel and give voice commands to.   If not that, then at a minimum, something that doesn't require the user to actually look for and touch a specific part of the screen, like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVbuk3jizGM  But the best GUI for controlling a car is no GUI at all....  When all of us have self driving cars, sure, make the entire windshield one giant social media feed. Until then, keep that shit out of cars please. There are too many people killed every year by distracted drivers. I was rear-ended three years ago by someone doing nothing more than adjusting their radio. It's a very serious reality that distracted drivers (and especially distracted teens), kill people. Let's not make cars more distracting than they have to be."
userexperience,3e4uy9,Vixze,2,Wed Jul 22 03:31:47 2015 UTC,Like the overall style. The only thing I thought could use some reconsideration the battery percentage. I'd put it at the top above the map similar to how cell phones have the percentage/battery icon.   I guess the organization of all that would just be customizable anyhow. Nice beyond that! Doing ux/ui for Tesla would be a dream.
userexperience,3e4uy9,teh_fizz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a UX expert, so bear with me please.  I really like what you did with the design. It's a preference, and that is I do not like the skeumorphic approach to UI. I find it outdated and reminds me of bad 2004 websites and shitty 3D modelling. I do like the nice, clean design you made. My comments are, the spacing between the rectangles is too big. To the point where it creates a lot of distance between the menu items. Another thing is, I'm not too keen on how much space each rectangle get. The hierarchy you have on your screen goes from GPS map, to music, to everything else. I personally don't want to see social media while driving. Nor do I care about the AC controls after I set them. To me it makes more sense to have them fade into the background or become smaller after a set period of time. While your design does provide clarity, the layering of the modules can be further improved to emphasise the hierarchy of the information displayed."
userexperience,3e4uy9,rubberhorsemask,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's a nice design for a dashboard, visually it separates everything into according tiles and the grouping idea is nice (I have no idea whatsoever about the current tesla dashboard)  First and foremost, the social media stream is very counterproductive as it distracts the driver intentionally from his responsibilities of driving and paying attention. You might as well install an alcohol IV next to the driver seat.  Apart from that slip I think the design has a lot of small details that are either unnecessary (in case it is too small) or dangerous (in case the driver pays more attention to it to decipher the information). This is supported a lot by visual design and IA.  IA/IX wise, I'd say that certain information doesn't exactly need to be displayed or should be prioritized differently. Such as the calls, which I would put way more prominently. The music player is split into three panels, library, player and volume. In the heating section the ""bar"" beneath each element shrinks usability compared to old-school non-digital buttons (where you tap on the seat-heating button to go from 0 > 1 > 2 > 3 > 0) I assume that in your case you'd have to tap on the icon and then regulate it on the bar - even though it only has four steps.  The Visual design is nice and clean, yet sometimes a bit too neutral and thus not very engaging. I understand your reasoning to put everything in grey to make it clean, however you have a very dominant background, that clashes with the main content and merges with the call. In any case, I'd try to switch colors.  The tiles themselves are very distinctive and yet have quite small details, such as small lines or scrollbars, which decreases readability. Furthermore, the design uses a lot of font sizes (why is Front, Rear, Flow different than Miles and Hours?). The battery panel is frankly quite boring. What could help here is a more engaging way of visualizing the reach in hrs and mins, while also showing that they are effectively the same. The bars in the heating area are very big (apart from being useless due to steps as described above) and the small green dots are too small to indicate the current level I think. The icons for the weather are nice, however I might rethink the color system, as you start from green for nice weather and end up with red for bad weather. In between though you have a turquoise, which comes out of the blue practically (no pun intended).   I would really recommend doing another try, especially since you say ""UX in mind"". It seems that the dashboard is nice, but not for a car or driving experience. As a matter of fact, a single screen rarely says anything about the UX and it frankly doesn't look like a good UX Design. I can't see any smart interjections or links to enhance UX but only dangerous and counterproductive enhancements, such as the social media stream or the small details. I hope you didn't just add the word UX in your title to make it sound better.  If I were you I'd muster up my energy and motivation and do another iteration to make a really great design that you might be able to put in your portfolio. If you want, I can always critique your design or help if you need any input.   edit: added a little encouragement to make it sound less devastating."

The absolute best way of doing that is to code - at least for your own projects. Design phone interfaces, you'll probably be better at understanding the real limitations of certain techniques if you fuff about with how those systems work at a code level. Design smart technology, probably better at understanding the domain if you actively build it for giggles during your x-mass break.   The reverse of this is true. Want to produce stellar code that has been conceptualised and designed in a UX process? Fuff about with the processes at home. Learn, and expand your mind with these solutions/tools.   That doesn't mean that you should actively design UX solutions at work. However, it does mean that you can have an informed conversation with the lead UX person on stuff or immediately see what they are trying when they come to you with a new idea (and vice versa)   The problem that you identified first is a problem with people in highly specialist roles doing unneeded work that is outside of their domain. So, I used to code in my uni days. I still write code to create reports and documentation for intelligence and statistical reasons, but it's not the same as the people I employ to write shipped products. However, I can have very detailed conversations with my programmers about technical challenges they are facing with my more wacky ideas."

If all you do is UX design (lucky you!) you'll be looking at who the user is and what they're trying to acheive. A good UX designer will spend longer understanding the problem than designing the solution IMO. If you are a dedicated UX designer, I would say it isn't so important. There will probably be other people in the team that just do visual design / implementation.  Depending on industry you are in and the size of the company, you may also have to do visual design and even do the HTML / CSS / front end JS. (especially smaller companies, where hybrid roles are more prominent) I started as a web developer and became a UI / UX designer. I've found my background has helped me hugely be a better designer. I know what's possible and I can easily bridge the gap between requirements and development. It's like being an architect, you may never get your hands dirty but you need to have an understanding of building materials and what's possible.   To summarise, I'd say it wasn't critical and it depends on the where you work but I've found it beneficial."

Nearly every job Ive appled for says you don't need to code but I really think those in the hiring processes in larger companies do not see the full picture.   Im going back to a coding bootcamp for this reason. Not full school (already have a BFA) but in getting some better experience working in development and writing those magic lines onbmy resume people will take you more seriously.

It gives you options, but it can be a tarpit for vision-holding as you go to implement, because there are tons and tons of shortcuts to be taken by compromising a little bit and accepting whatever the coding ecosystem has to offer at that moment. Being able to scribble out things on paper and not worry about implementation difficulty is essential to coming up with good designs - an IDE or text editor gives you a different lens that can only coincidentally match with good UX.  The really huge advantages come when you have not just some coding skills but extensive understanding of certain domains. For example, knowing digital signal processing, I can think about a UX for dealing with audio or image processing in terms of creating a behind-the-scenes algorithm that automates away most of the UI."

I'm currently teaching myself JavaScript alongside PHP because I want to get more into actual interactions, and my work starting in the fall actually uses Drupal for most of their websites.

Most reports are super confidential, so it can be difficult to show what you have been doing outside of your company.  Here are a few ideas, some long-term and some short-term:  1) Get your company to let you do a white paper or thought leadership project.  Since it is going to be published, you don't have to worry about confidentiality.   2) While sharing details of a usability study is difficult, you can sometimes layout the components of an exploratory/generative project like an ethnography.  Just talk in broad terms about the how you explored the issues and what kind of insights/recommendations you delivered.  If you are in-house pointing to impact can be a huge bonus.  For job interviews I sort of anonymized a report and took out some key details and findings.   3) In my portfolio I have several case studies in this format:   Project: Exploratory Research for a Logistics Company to Determine Unmet Needs for Power Users Method: Longitudinal diary study followed by ethnographies conducted in the work environments of participants  Findings: Users tended to repeatedly perform a narrow, but idiosyncratic,  range of actions AND Users were unaware of the amount of integration with other systems supported by the software as they were overwhelmed by options and features they did not use Recommendations: Develop a modular interface so users could customize the interface for the tasks they performed the most AND Increase awareness of dedicated software for power users to convert them from the web interface   It is broad enough that they can get an idea of your work, but still general enough that you are not violating confidentiality. I have a friend who has a similar approach, but adds a ""Challenges"" section so they can talk about how they mitigated/overcame those challenges in an interview.   Hope that helps!"

In fact if you look at Google design, you'll note that the one job opening they call out is for a ""motion designer."" ""Animation"" makes it sound like it's a cherry on top (or a tool, in any case), whereas to be most successful, it needs to be a smoothly blended ingredient of the experience from the beginning.  Here's a random article that's probably not very good but appears to be a decent intro: http://www.beyondkinetic.com/motion-ui-design-principles/  Material design also has a great perspective on motion and how it should be used from a UI perspective: https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html  For your existing project, find one or two small ways to add motion consistently throughout as a start.

userexperience,3dxycu,arenns,7,Mon Jul 20 13:20:27 2015 UTC,Always paper first. So fast.
userexperience,3dxycu,rwallen,5,Mon Jul 20 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"By paper prototypes do you mean wireframes on paper or do you mean simulating the final product with an actual paper prototype?   If you mean wireframes then always paper. Why? Three reasons:    You have to think about things like order of construction before putting a pen on paper.  It's super easy to collaborate with in a meaningful way. I normally sketch up ideas with clients and other team members in a way that allows them to grab a pen and immediately draw or comment on the design. It's right there, this tangible thing, with notes, boxes and arrows, wireframes, doodles for logos, blah blah blah. It's fast to iterate ideas. Much faster than any digital product on the market.    Digital mockups are great, but I feel they are more meaningful once the concept is well on it's way.   If you mean physical paper prototypes:   I like paper for a number of reasons. One of the biggest is not only because you really need to think about how it works before you can build it but every person you give it to really sits back and thinks about how it works. It really delivers a tonne of information and context to the product that you make.   There is something so much more meaningful to see a little tab that you can pull out with your finger and see actual content slide out from the frame than compared to a little note on the side of your low fidelity interaction specification and then a new interaction. It's even a lot better than a poorly optimised digital product that starts to blur the line between a product version of uncanny valleys where you expect it to be optimised even though you know it's Axure."
userexperience,3dxycu,metasophie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your post! I meant wireframes on paper. I'm reading a book that touches on paper prototyping (i'm pretty new to UX), and I wasn't sure how common this approach still is today considering tools like Axure are now easily accessible.   When you say ""a little tab that you can pull out with your finger and see actual content slide out from the frame"", do you mean your paper prototypes feature actual mechanics, much like interactive children's books? Or do you have someone manually slide in the content when the participant pulls a tab? I'm just trying to get an idea of how elaborate my prototypes should be for my portfolio.  Thank you!"
userexperience,3dxycu,oddible,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"Axure is a beast, you can do a LOT with it but one of the most important aspects if UX is iteration.  Get your ideas out quickly and frequently and get feedback on each iteration.  Paper first, there is no way to mock up a simple concept faster than paper and pen."
userexperience,3dxycu,metasophie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"considering tools like Axure are now easily accessible.   Axure is a great specifications/wireframing tool. Especially as you transition from low fidelity to high(er) fidelity and/or interactivity.   Paper prototypes are a tool where you can rapidly make concepts that fill out a basic storyboard. Because sketching is so rapid the individual scenes have little or no value by themselves. In fact, their only value is their effectiveness in the story board. So, if you spent all of 5 minutes creating a ""story board"" of interactions that describe how a user logs on and I come out with ""naah, that's shit for this reason"" you won't care as much as you would about something that spent 25 minutes on in axure.   Axure is often a huge time trap for truly rapid thought generation. One personal, anecdotal, example is that it shits the living stuffings out of me to see unaligned elements in Axure. I can't help it. I know many of my clients feel this way too - even the ones that you'd willingly involve in the early conceptualisation process. On paper though nobody gives a shit.   Sure, there are tools available that digitise the sketch look but all this does is basically say ""draft"" without physically putting a watermark on the page.    When you say ""a little tab that you can pull out with your finger and see actual content slide out from the frame"", do you mean your paper prototypes feature actual mechanics, much like interactive children's books?    Yes, that's exactly what I mean. I will admit that making a physical paper prototype is a lot harder today due to the way we interact with devices, but sometimes it's down right fun to do so. It's also amazing when you manage to pull it off. You can also do limited user testing.   This technique is stolen from industrial designers and to a lessor extent architects.    I'm just trying to get an idea of how elaborate my prototypes should be for my portfolio   It probably depends on what your goals are. Are your goals primarily the interface design aspect?"
userexperience,3dxycu,twelvedollarlabcoat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:49:56 2015 UTC,"you won't care as much as you would about something that spent 25 minutes on in axure.   I really hadn't thought of that. Makes perfect sense.    On paper though nobody gives a shit.   This too, haha.   Yes, that's exactly what I mean.   That's actually really impressive... (granted most of what I know about the UX process as of yet is from textbooks). I should have payed attention in all those arts and crafts classes...   Are your goals primarily the interface design aspect?   To be honest, i'm still at a crossroads when it comes to specialization. I guess interface design would be the primary focus, but what i'd really love to do.. is help clients enhance product/service quality by going in-field to optimize their internal system flow, work practice efficiency, and corporate culture. However, i'm not quite sure how I could accomplish such a task as a novice without experience.   Thanks a million for taking the time to explain. It helps a lot!"
userexperience,3dxycu,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"Both! When I'm stuck on how to arrange elements I print everything, cut it out, and try a whole bunch of stuff.  With paper it's easier to take risks and you're less in danger of trying to tweak pixels.  Not once have I ever tried to sliders/tabs or what not. That'd just take longer than doing it digitally these days."
userexperience,3dxycu,mattBernius,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"In our office, our Experience Architects will often start with sketching, but the wireframes are always done in either Illustrator or InDesign.  In terms of testing (which I can speak directly to), depending on the environment, we will test wireframes and early visual comps on paper. In fact we have a paper based round of testing happening today.  The decision to paper prototype versus enhanced pdf versus interactive web (Invision or Axure) is always determined by the needs of the project and the testing protocol we're going to follow.  You find the hat to fit the head, not the other way around."
userexperience,3dxycu,mattBernius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:06 2015 UTC,Experience Architects    Would this simply be another term for UX Designer? (There are so many synonymous terms!)   but the wireframes are always done in either Illustrator or InDesign.   Is there a specific reason as to why your EAs prefer using Illustrator/InDesign over prototyping tools like Axure? Are their mockups generally static?   Thank you so much for your insight!
userexperience,3dxycu,oddible,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:02 2015 UTC,"Experience Architects is the term we use in house for Experience/UX designers. It's in part to differentiate their role from our Visual Designers (who they team with on the final project).   Is there a specific reason as to why your EAs prefer using Illustrator/InDesign over prototyping tools like Axure? Are their mockups generally static?   Workflow. Starting the designs in the Adobe CS allows them to go anywhere. Including using the wireframes for the basis of the skinning.  We also tend to do high fidelity wireframes.  While we think dynamically, we do mock-up statically. Primarily this is because most system based interactions are already pretty well set.   What we're concerned with is representing the overall metaphors and then letting the systems people apply those metaphors against their specific needs.  Now, if it's a particularly complex or subtle interaction, we may create a dynamic prototype. But if that's the case we've already built that into the cost of the job. And we love building prototypes when we can.  Unfortunately, a lot of clients aren't willing to pay for them."
userexperience,3dxycu,mattBernius,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's pretty darn interesting. (Most of what I know regarding UX is only from books, so it's awesome being able to ask my questions directly to working pros.)   How often is it that your team can afford to build complex, dynamic prototypes? Is ""Agile"" style development very common? Do you conduct lab or in-field usability test sessions where participants interact with your static prototypes? What types of projects/products does your team typically undertake? Consumer products/services, Internal work domain systems (simple/complex), etc..?    While we think dynamically, we do mock-up statically. Primarily this is because most system based interactions are already pretty well set.    When you say ""pretty well set"", do you mean your team is confident these interactions/features will not be subjected to major iterations in the future? Has having most system interactions not being tested dynamically by users/participants ever caused additional iterations or issues either before or after release?   I apologize for all the questions, but i'm extremely curious! Thank you for your great post!"
userexperience,3dxycu,oddible,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"Best answer is that it always depends on the client and the statement of work that was negotiated:   How often is it that your team can afford to build complex, dynamic prototypes?    Actually not too often. Because of the work we do, we typically focus on patterning complex interactions versus trying to do literal representations of complete systems.   Is ""Agile"" style development very common?   Again, depends on the project and the client. If the client requires an Agile process thats what we are going to do. If left to our own devices we'll probably do more of an ""agile lite."" A lot of this also depends on the project timeline and fundings levels.   Do you conduct lab or in-field usability test sessions where participants interact with your static prototypes?   Almost always some variation of in-field testing. My office doesn't have it's own testing lab.   What types of projects/products does your team typically undertake?   Checkout our website: http://www.effectiveui.com   When you say ""pretty well set"", do you mean your team is confident these interactions/features will not be subjected to major iterations in the future?   Generally speaking, yes. Think about it this way -- if you're designing a mobile app you're working with an iOS or (now) Material Design framework. These don't radically shift or at least not all that fast.  If we're creating an application experience from the ground up, then the assumption is typically that the general framework is going to last for a couple years. Sure there will be tweaks, but -- barring a significant change in functionality -- if there needs to be a major changes to the UX/UI that means we did our job right.   Has having most system interactions not being tested dynamically by users/participants ever caused additional iterations or issues either before or after release?   In my two years with the company, I can't think of a case. But to be clear, when we have the budget to test, we test all of the major metaphors and interaction models we can.  Its just that after a certain point, getting over granular in testing quickly leads to diminishing returns. And additionally, for there's a reason why expert UX designers are experts. They can take representative feedback about a given metaphor or model and extrapolate it into meaningful revisions across an interface or product."

userexperience,3dxycu,Baconaise,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"Sketch isn't a UX tool, it is a UI tool.  In most design groups that have a dedicated UX or Interaction Designer most are producing content at very low fidelity and if they're working at high fidelity they have a mixed role.  You SHOULD be reproducing a lot of work to deliver assets because your UX folks shouldn't be producing results that can be 'converted' to product.  If your UX folks are working in transferrable tech they're focusing on the wrong stuff or are having to split their mind between USER experience and interface coding. You don't want this ideally.  Tools such as Omnigraffle, Balsamiq, UXPin work better for this.  Even Axure if your UX folks can resist the urge to be UI coders.  Since many of us in UX come from a coding background it is difficult to keep us focused on UX and not implementation details, likewise, the rest of us who come from a design background it is difficult to keep us focused on UX and not pixel perfect comps.   I did a contract for one large company with a 35 person UX/IxD group that required all UX / IxD to use Google Draw to force us to NOT spend any time on implementation or design.  We were always paired with an interface coder and a visual designer and a copywriter. Was a great environment."

This is completely out of touch with my experience. I find designers under intense pressure to ""just create the wireframes"" so we can get on with the real work of coding.  I suppose if you had no real pride in your work and were just willing to throw a design out there when the deadline came around, rather than try to do actual due diligence during your deadline then your life would be pretty lackadaisical. Is that the equivalent though?   UX is a relatively new field these days, especially in the corporate world. As a result, your colleagues are not sure what to expect from you.This can go both ways as some may think you don’t do any work at all   Well then you aren't really doing your job very well unless this is the first week they hired you.

What is expected of you as a UXer is going to vary greatly from engagement to engagement. There are a lot of other players involved and who does what isn't always so clear. Understanding the overall process and being able to see what is needed for a given project and where to contribute most effectively is essential.

I would show those projects off first, no matter if they have an ugly UI (or if they have a UI at all) because it will show employers that you have that prior programming experience.   In the meantime, I would focus on doing small projects where you analyze something (a webpage, an app), say what you dislike about it from a UX standpoint, and then say what you would do to improve it, as well as showing mockups of what your updated UI would look like. You wouldn't even have to code it, static pictures will be fine as long as your points gets across."

If you are going to do user research, PD, usability, etc as part of your UI design then call it UX, if not, then it is UI design and you absolutely need a portfolio (even more for UI than UX).    In any event, your portfolio is less useful if it shows only end product.  It should also show process, and most of all it should show rationale - the decisions you made and on what information you made your decisions.

I've tried to find examples of good portfolios for review, which I might be able to model my own on. The most engaging ones I've found are those which have case studies, telling a story about the project - this one, for example: http://simonpan.com/  Anyway, you're probably suffering article fatigue by now, similar to how I am (and it's so easy to trick yourself into thinking you're being productive by reading stacks of them), but these are more specifically about portfolios, which might be of interest: * http://www.uxbeginner.com/category/ux-portfolios/ * https://betteruxportfolios.wordpress.com/  With regard to Manchester, I attended my first Northern UX event on Monday in the city centre. I was hoping that it would be a good opportunity to speak with UX practitioners and perhaps get to know a few a bit better in order to build my personal network. It was beer and pizza, then a talk, followed by beer. The event didn't really lend itself to impromptu networking as everyone else there seemed to be in their own little groups, so I felt a bit isolated. Still, if you're the sort of person who has the confidence to insert yourself into others' conversations, it might be more productive.  Are you based in Manchester itself?

userexperience,3dk3ti,Fractales,12,Thu Jul 16 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"When I was making a portfolio site I considered these, but then threw them out for the same reason. They just don't say anything. That is what a portfolio is for if you ask me."
userexperience,3dk3ti,just_a_nice_person,2,Thu Jul 16 23:46:06 2015 UTC,Yeah you should definitely have a portfolio to show off your skills but don't you also want a downloadable resume on there? And wouldn't this be a better resume than a plain text one?
userexperience,3dk3ti,Chris_Hansen_AMA,2,Fri Jul 17 00:30:21 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I would prefer to outline the skills in a more concrete fashion still. Even if it was just a paragraph explaining what I'm capable of with the software."

userexperience,3dk3ti,Vordus,11,Fri Jul 17 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely prefer seeing someone's actual portfolio and work process than some arbitrary numbers busying up their actual printed resume.  If you list the skills, I expect you to be somewhat competent in them like I expect your experience/education to be fulfilled.  If I want to see implementation of your skills, I will look at your portfolio and give you an interview.    I think it just adds noise to your resume."
userexperience,3dk3ti,gmpilot,9,Thu Jul 16 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"Fair warning: I'm about to get on my high-horse...  I hate them. They waste valuable space on the resume that should be used for actual information. In your third example, all the resume actually says is 4 places they worked and 3 schools. The entire right side of the resume tells me that they know only know how to use 6 programs (and that they are terrible at 2 of them). Give me a list of the programs you know without telling me your biased personal skill level. I really don't care if you know what ever tool does in Photoshop- if your portfolio looks like shit then you won't get hired.  I also hate when designers' resumes are too graphic oriented. Example 2 is an example of a really terrible resume. Not only does it say nothing, but it also says nothing badly. It tells me that this person knows how to waste space on paper and does not actually describe anything at all. They sacrificed space to explain their experience so they could put a pie chart that says absolutely nothing. When it comes to the Skills section, this person obviously thinks they're great at everything. I also don't want to know what you're still learning vs. what you already ""mastered"". Write it down and let's talk about it in an interview.  The first resume is the best of the three, but I would still not regard it as a good resume design. We learn a few sentences of background on this person, 2 positions and 2 schools. This person was at least smart enough to let the negative space do it's thing so that his name and contact information stands out. Regarding his ""skills"" section, he is saying he is the best in the world at Photoshop and is telling me that he sucks at AfterEffects and Vegas. If he just put a list of programs, I wouldn't be able to jump to conclusions, and he'd also be able to explain a bit more about his work experience.  I know we weren't discussing resume design overall, but I couldn't help myself. At the very least they are two-column layouts which allows the designers to fit more information on the page. If I had a stack of resumes, the only one of these three that I would read for more than 10 seconds is the first one.  tl;dr - Skill charts make people jump to conclusions. Make a list of the programs (or whatever) that you know. The resume's job is to get you an interview, so add more information to your experiences and less information about how well you know programs. Same goes for your website. Let your portfolio showcase your skill level."

The placeholder content itself is irrelevant to that point."
userexperience,3dk3ti,Groggie,3,Fri Jul 17 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"Damn. I'm the only one that kinda likes them a little. Background: I spent a lot of time reviewing resumes for our creative team, mostly developers but I helped out with the hiring of some designers as well. The point is that most people are not experts in EVERYthing, and a chart like that (as objective as it definitely is) helped me to understand where they focus their efforts. Yes, it highlights some weaknesses, but we were gonna find those out about you at some point anyway so you might as well be upfront and help steer that conversation. You ABSOLUTELY have to verify the applicant has the skills they say they do by reviewing their body of work, but something like that at least gives me some general direction upfront."
userexperience,3dk3ti,weallwearmasks,5,Fri Jul 17 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"My immediate thought is that unless you do a brilliant job you're going to highlight flaws in your resume. Here are some examples:   ONE  His Education puts him straight through to hard core technical nerd, which is okay, but generally speaking these people are incredibly rare in UXD.   His experience says Graphic Designer and Web Developer. Not User Experience Design.   His skills enforce this, with no mention of skills that come out of UX/IxD spectrum.   All in all if this resume appeared on my desk it would next appear in my bin.   TWO  Objective: Needs to add more keywords to help me hit my buzzword bingo card for the day. Maybe something like:   Seeking for an establishment where my creativity and relevant experience will be utilized to pivot on disruptive low-hanging fruit. YOLO!   Quest Achieved? sigh. Not to mention it's inverted from what people care about. Do I really care more about when you graduated from university than your last 4-7 years of experience in the field?   Powerups and Romantic Affairs seem to exist simply to patch some white space.   Creativity: Waste of space. Poor use of information architecture.   Skills: Mixed words and buttons. Probably because they have a poor mastery of IA and layout experience.   Magical Powers: Probably the most important part to provide to an employer and they left it until last. Still, it's just some words and doesn't provide any context on what they mean by any of that or examples of work. Also, I give literally no fucks if somebody is a sci-fi lover.   To be fair, my office assistant would have binned this resume before giving it me. She knows me too well.   THREE  Not bad. I've seen a lot worse. Although, I wonder if it would have been better to put the name/title stuff on the right hand column and just push the experience and education stuff straight to the top. From the users point of view that's what I care about. Languages are also probably in the wrong spot. I probably want them below software. They should probably remove skills that they aren't middle of the road in.   Overall it broadly transmits that they are a graphic designer and somewhat skilled. More in illustrator than photoshop and some experience in Flash.   It could be a lot worse. If this was like a cover page to a CV or portfolio I would probably turn the page.    I'm of the opinion that they're arbitrary, bad information design and, therefore, bad UX.   To be fair though, most resumes have some part of them that says something like ""Advanced understanding of <blah>"", Experienced in running <foo>"", and ""Exposure to <bah>"". It's really the same thing.   If you used these as a cover page for a larger body of work like a detailed CV or portfolio then the idea of them is probably okay."

Somebody could show a portfolio of fantastic looking work but when under time pressure produces significantly different bodies of work. Somebody could call themselves competent and actually be crazy good.   The reality is that anything that describes a skill is subjective and open to interpretation.
userexperience,3dk3ti,Chris_Hansen_AMA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"You just invented that scale, though.     It's obviously a scale that fills going from left to right.  The only thing you could make an argument about is that they probably should have included some sort of legend.     Nowhere did anyone say 5/5 is expert   It has no more stars. Thus there is no more experience/talent/skill that the poster could have.   I'll admit that it's a warning sign to me when ever somebody suggest that they are top shit in anything but if they are only trying to communicate a broad impression of their skill level then that's okay.    That's the problem... it's ambiguous.    The reality is your application of a skill is always going to be ambiguous. What is your background in using the tool? Do you produce large scale graphic art pieces or do you just frame web sites? How do you perform under pressure?  If I told you I was an 'expert' at photoshop or had 'deep experience' in user testing, what does that really mean? Even a portfolio isn't some sort of objective truth for how you perform on a day to day basis because people only put their best examples online. How do I know what you can produce on an average day? I can't.  The goal of the visuals is to impart a broad impression not some precise scale.

It's pretty neat, not sure about scalability though.  If you want really easy to set up/no knowledge then WAMP/MAMP/XAMP is the way to go, or using a basic wordpress/joomla/drupal/whatever CMS.

You've provided a nice breadth of content, from mobile to desktop.  I'm not a huge fan of UX portfolios. I'm guessing I'm alone in that and just need to come around to the idea, but it's incredibly difficult to describe what a UX Designer does with just pictures, and often the words ring really hollow.  That said, where I think you might have ""missed the mark"" is in the story you're trying to tell. When I interview, I want to hear about how you came to realize the problem (if you can include the user part of UX here all the better!), what the problem is, how you proposed to solve it and—maybe most importantly—how you iterated on it based on feedback.  To me (again, I'm a curmudgeon), a portfolio is a bit of a stand in for the conversation where we discuss this process.   I would work to parse out your work to two of the most important things you've done and then find a way to tell the story of how they came to be and what you did. I'd be specific.

Experience design is all about context and you've given us none, so all that you're asking about is style.  I've gotten into a lot of arguments with visual designers because breadcrumbs don't fit their personal aesthetics, but frankly I've yet to care. Breadcrumbs are still one of the most valuable ways to help users develop a hierarchical understanding of the system they're using. After being asked to find research to support not using breadcrumbs, I came back with a list of articles that showed how valuable they are. (This is also where my strong opinion and ranting come from) Here's a sampling from that list:   http://marketingland.com/breadcrumb-links-good-user-experience-yes-97848 http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/52/breadcrumb.htm http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/61/breadcrumb.htm http://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumb-navigation-useful/   Here's what this means: Stop asking questions like this. If your question is ""Hey, for my users, does a breadcrumb navigation make sense?"" then others can ask qualifying questions that see if it's a good fit. Breadcrumbs work when you are conveying the structure of a big hierarchy, or when users need to get back to earlier categories. So sure, it's pointless to use breadcrumbs on a site if it's 2 levels deep or if it's a blog, but otherwise they are tremendously useful."
userexperience,3dhlsd,glucasroe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"What about for sites that don't go very deep? Top nav with drop down menus, so two levels deep right? Maybe even three levels for one or two sections of the site."
userexperience,3dhlsd,relatedartists,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"If you're talking 2 levels, a persistent nav that shows state is usually enough.   For the third level, it really depends on what brought you to that depth of the site. You could give a method to just take users up one level, or to give contextual links to other areas of the site. For some things like a blog on a corporate site, you can even opt for a different header treatment entirely that shows it as a subsection and allows the user to hop back out of it.  The important part is establishing the structure and conveying it to the user."
userexperience,3dhlsd,glucasroe,3,Fri Jul 17 11:54:12 2015 UTC,Why do you think so?   I think it depends on the site and on your audience.

The traditional ""website>resources>downloads>case studies"" is horizontal, and usually one size of type, but it's trying to convey hierarchal information. It makes it difficult to distinguish each level in your hierarchy at a glance.  What's easier to read, an address written in one line or an address written with recipient's name, street and number, city/state/zip each on it's own line?  It also doesn't take advantage of availability to keep users engaged and let them know what other pages they can visit.  I much prefer a good footer and good non-hamburger menu"

I'm really fond of banners for category pages, as I think most people at worst need a little hint ""here's what you're looking at"". Breadcrumbs are unnecessary and see little user interaction where present, and most people are aware of the hierarchy unless we're talking deeply-nested categories. But that alone is a context that makes breadcrumbs occasionally valuable."

You need to think about people who land on pages other than the home page. Just because you design it for people to go there first doesn't mean it will happen in practice. People link to other pages for example, or searches may deliver them to other pages from google. And when they don't see the links, how does it impact their behaviour?  Seems to me like a clear cut AB question, not something you could easily user test in a paper prototype or user test flow simply because it's primarily about natural usage of the site, not something you can script with a user test or just ask people about. So, perhaps you'll have to code it up and try it out on somebody.

Bruce Tognazzini argues that it's because Apple is designing more for prospective users than for current ones.  Here's a relevant quote from the article that I'm referencing   Hiding the scroll bar, from a user’s perspective, is madness. If the user wants to actually scroll, it’s bad enough:  He or she is now forced to use a thumbwheel or gesture to invoke scrolling, as the scroll bar is no longer even present.  However, if the user simply wants to see their place within the document, things can quickly spiral out of control: The only way to get the scroll bar to appear is to initiate scrolling, so the only way to see where you are right now in a document is to scroll to a different part of the document!"
userexperience,3dfkbw,glucasroe,3,Wed Jul 15 22:20:57 2015 UTC,"Tog's right, in my opinion. But meanwhile, you can change the settings to always show the scrollbar: Apple Menu > System Preferences > General > Show scroll bars: Always"

And most of the times his insights are rock-solid and I definitely see where his arguments are coming from this time round. Though this particular passage has an ""it has always been done this way, therefore it must forever be done this way""-ring to it:   ""...forced to use a thumbwheel or gesture...""   What? You need to use current interaction models to navigate software... how could they?!   ""...is to scroll to a different part of the document!"".   Again, overly dramatic. A single tick on the scroll wheel won't zoom you to another location in the document.  It's the updated knowledge of generations. When computers where a new thing, scrollbars where absolutely necessary to give users an indicator on where they where or even show them that the content is scrollable. But with the advent of smartphones and tablets, the notion that content is scrollable has cross-pollinated user-bases.  The question then remains: Do you keep holding on to things from the past, trying to satisfy everybody or do you cut away ye olde systems and be in danger of alienating a few people, forcing them to update their knowledge-base.  (Along the same lines, killing off diskettes and CD/DVD-drives spring to mind.)  Then again, I do count myself as a pro-user, so I might have a skewed view on things.  EDIT: Just to be clear: I don't think Apple is having total success UX-wise with the current releases of their OSes. On the contrary, there's a ton of unfocussed and half-assed stuff going on. cough iTunes cough. I personally just believe that scrollbars are a product of a time with simpler interaction models, and fading them out is not the wrong thing to do."

I desesperately looked for clues to proceed further. I even rebooted the computer, thinking that it could have frozen in the middle of a transition.  No, it was just the invisible scrollbar.

userexperience,3dfkbw,Highandfast,2,Thu Jul 16 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"I know you're more responding to Tog than me, but the original problem was that the user doesn't know how to scroll in the first place.

userexperience,3dfkbw,gofastrightnow,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to add that it isn't a matter of holding to old conventions. I am very much into innovative thinking and I'm all for trying new interfaces.  If your scrollbars are visible, you have the positioning information right away. You can then perform the right action.   If they are not, then you first have to perform *some * action (which you can learn over time,  but will always be costly) at *some * location on screen (which can be non-obvious, and might force the user to play an infuriating old-school point&click).  When the user manages to do that, he will be at the starting point of the first situation, where scrollbars are visible. This is seriously detrimental to the general usability."

It's probably meant to keep you looking at carousels as much as possible, hunting for things you like, in the hope that you'll see something you weren't looking for and buy it anyway. Also, it needs to obfuscate the really poor quality of the sale.  Kind of like the convoluted layouts of supermarkets, designed with great care to take you all through the shop when you want to buy basics, on the off chance you'll drop a few unneeded items in your cart.  So I don't think it's bad ux per se, just a dark pattern - one that, judging by people's general reaction to the sale, seems to have failed."

userexperience,3deeb1,centipeed,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's important to consider that ""good"" UX and ""effective"" UX are not necessarily the same thing. ""Good"" implies that the UX is designed to benefit the user as much as possible. This is not always desired, though. Amazon may well have done a lot of very intensive research and found out that people buy more if the deals are presented to them in this way. I think it's easy to forget that not all people are the same, when trying to critique design choices like this. If you're visiting Amazon to see if a specific type of item is on sale (Video games, perhaps), you might have a frustrating time. But what if 80% of the people visiting the page don't have any items in mind? What if they're just looking for sweet bargains? In those cases I'd imagine allowing the user to choose a category or narrow their search would hurt sales, not help them, since it would let them stop and think about what they actually NEED, rather than what they're willing to buy if the price is right.   I learned something from Design Explosions that I like to keep in mind in these cases:    The team that built this product is smart and talented. There are many things we can’t know without joining the team.    In other words, I very much doubt that Amazon leafed through a UI patterns book and picked one that looked cool. I suspect they chose to present the sale this way because it makes them more money.  As a parting thought, think about how much more interesting these comments would have been if the atmosphere was ""Why was this design chosen? What benefits does it have?"" rather than, ""Let's all talk about how shit this design is."""

While both Axure and Framer can be used for ""prototyping"", they are fundamentally different tools.  Axure is unbeatable when it comes to handling complex processes and multi-screen flows. Framer (Origami, Pixate...) are great for quick demos and showing how certain details should behave, in a purerly visual manner. And finaly Invision – super painful for iterative prototyping (even with tools like Invision Sync combined with auto layer comp export) while great for collaborating and getting feedback on the actual visual layer.  Here's one of my projects, utilizing both Axure and Framer. The Axure one covers all users flows but is super raw, the Framer one (gif at the top) is visually polished, but showcases just one detail.

userexperience,3de28i,Kyle6969,6,Mon Jul 20 07:06:31 2015 UTC,Why do you say Axure is too old? I tried a few software and I always come back to Axure. It is the king of prototyping tool with powerful interaction capabilities.   Code prototyping is quite different to standard prototyping tools. I feel with Axure one can perform major changes substantially quicker than code prototype can. Reality is that for complex circumstances a mixture of tools should be used for appropriate fidelity.  So one can break it down into 4 types of prototyping.    Paper - Very low-fi and  is to get workflow and general layout correct Low-Fi tools (EG: Balsamiq) - More detailed layout work. Personally I generally do not use Low-Fi tools as I can perform the same task on a Hi-Fi tool. Hi-Fi tools (EG: Axure) - Interactions and high fidelity look. Code prototyping - Detailed interactions as most Hi-FI tools can only do basic interactions and pixel perfect mockups.    I personally detest web apps as they get sluggish and I can get most of the functionality with Axure or other desktop tools anyway.  My recommendation? Since you are doing general web work Axure is probably the tool you should try to embrace. it is very good for web. Not so much for apps and I have yet to try but there seem to be some other more specialized tools out there.

Make that two max. Homepage: You tell something about yourself right on the Home (""I currently live in San Francisco...""), but then you also link to a separate ""About me"" page. Why two locations to learn about yourself? One is enough.  Main navigation: Why is Home not all-caps like the other two menu items? Portfolio: ""Click on the photos to expand the image"". No! You have the space, so use it. I'd definitely rethink how you present your projects. I really do like how you show your work-process steps in the project and not just the end product. But make it a story, not just an uninspired list of points. Big images, bold statements, focus on process. Portfolio: You have two ""back to top"" links at the bottom of the pages. Right under the project, and the ""Top"" arrow in the lower right. Cut one. *Portfolio: ""Just a sample of my work. To see more..."". No! If you can show more, put it in the portfolio. Don't make a potential client take the hurdle to contact you to find out more. He won't. You should rewrite that sentence to be just a CTA along the lines of ""for more questions about this project, feel free to contact me..."" *Portfolio, Travel brochure: the ""View Live Version""-button is linked to the wrong place. About Me: The two red icons for Skill and Education are, a) off-center, b) low-resolution and c) not self-explanatory.  Footer: Same problem with the icons as mentioned right above. Overall: Fine-tune your copywriting. Example: ""Many people found their talents as a child when they would play with Legos or an instrument, I spent most of my childhood partaking in online communities and exploring the vast world called the internet."" I know where you're coming from, but you're using filler prose. Focus on what you did and how this shaped you to become the person you are today. Cut the fluff. I hope you don't take it as an offense, but maybe you could elaborate what ""Being visually impaired myself"" means in your case. One eye blind, near-sighted, a variation of color blindness, could all possibilities here. By further embracing what your impairment actually is, you can use it to make it a driving factor and focal element of your work. Just a thought, you must definitely feel comfortable doing so. *All in all, your website isn't bad, but currently rather unfocussed.

userexperience,3d916i,centipeed,2,Tue Jul 14 13:17:59 2015 UTC,"You ought to look into using a wireframing tool like Axure or even Invision (not quite a wireframing tool, but good enough to give you the flow + annotations).  It's easier for developers to be able to actually click through a dynamic wireframe prototype to see how it behaves, than read only a static document.  Of course, business requirements/rules still need to be enumerated, but an actual wireframe helps avoid confusion. It also allows the designer and client to miss any obvious dead-ends and flaws in the business rules/logic.  Also, if possible, the developers should be involved early in the discovery/specification phase. Clients almost universal ask for insane things that are hard to implement, when a simpler and better solution is available.  Here's one real world example:  I had a client that wanted a content river on the home page. They wanted that content to come from multiple sources (blog, articles, galleries), but didn't understand that it's easy enough to do that in code. They had a kind of Wordpress perspective on it, and thought the home page could ONLY be blog posts. So they asked us for all these intermediary pages where they could take, say, an article, and rewrite it as a blog post, or a gallery, and include it as a blog post (no copy, just the gallery)  It took some explaining to get them to understand they didn't actually need to have these intermediary pages - they could just post this new content and then we could make it look however they wanted, and give them the option to include it on the home page content river with a simple checkbox.  The best design documents won't make silly client requests any better, so my strongest recommendation is to let developers nip those in the bud as early in the process as possible. Less for you to document, better experience for the client, and faster implementation for developers."

If you can't talk to them for whatever reason, here's my tip:  A good old fashioned .psd or other raw format design file is great, so they can get the exact sizes, colours etc without hassle. Some devs don't know how to use the software/ don't have it though, so do ask. If they don't, then you'll need to give them a doc with all hex colours, and sizes, preferably in the form of a labelled PDF of the designs. I like to do a ""use flow"" describing what each page is, and labeling colours of buttons, fonts used, font weight and size, and rounded corner sizes, and how one gets to each page, what all actionable objects do, with links to what animations will look like. Links are to things that have code associated e.g. examples on codrops, or existing websites."

We're a very 9-5 type of company. A startup might be crazier in terms of hours. You just need to ask good questions about the culture of the company while interviewing and see if it's a fit.

The agency has no problem chewing through employees as there is always someone new to replace them with.  Ditto, the stay away from agencies."
userexperience,3d32s9,Pixel8tedOne,3,Mon Jul 13 14:00:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who's worked for several years in the ad industry before getting fed up completely and switching to freelance UX, I can't agree more. (I can already feel the frustration boiling up in me...)  There's two things to consider:   Creative agencies have ridiculous work hours (no surprise there). As in, ""works done when it's done"". Which is never.  But most importantly, creative agencies have zero respect for UX. It's the ""big ideas"" and design/copy teams who run the show. UX will often only become a consideration on the projects, after the groundwork has already been laid out and sold to the customer. And then you have to work with this crappy foundation and try to create a non-shitty experience. Often the art directors will create screen layouts without any UX consultation whatsoever. Because ""wireframes don't look nice in a presentation"" or ""the customer wouldn't understand them anyways"". So what happens is that all the discussion will be about the look and feel, colours, typography, visual branding and the actual UI elements just become an afterthought. So I'd be faced with a customer that expects a vertical three-point menu on the side, but I see at one glance, that the position and structure of the menu makes zero sense. But it's sold, so it's the way to be. There's tons of examples like this. The one that motivated me to leave my last employer was as follows. We had a new project at hand, (no time for any personas, funnels, etc.), it was straight to the wireframes. I whip up a first lo-fi batch, for internal discussion, to find a route to pursue further. My creative director was a veteran in the business, with years of experience in the biggest ad agencies. So I lay down the wires, he quickly scans over them and finally says, ""Please make sure to use a serif typeface here"". I say, ""That's the default text font in OmniGraffle, I haven't put any design considerations in whatsoever. But what about the different structures of the page?"". ""You decide, but just make sure the font is no longer sans-serif"". And that was the point I finally realised, that UX is not a true part of the creative industry.   So yeah, avoid creative agencies."

userexperience,3d32s9,ssflyer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:28:41 2015 UTC,"Let’s just say I didn’t go the typical career route to get to where I’m now. Many moons ago I started off as an electronics engineer but after finishing that apprenticeship did a 180° turn and studied design with specialisation in interaction design. After that several odd events lead to my very first job at an ad agency, where I became a concept designer (aka “idea guy”). This went on for several years (and I must stress that I definitely had awesome times along the way!), but eventually had to come to an end, due to the reasons stated above. So I found myself at a crossroads and looking back I decided to refocus on UX/UI design, since this had always been important to me. For reasons I’m still not quite clear until this day, I thought going freelance would be the best way. But it all turned out nicely. My time at the agencies had given me a massive network of contacts, through which I managed to find my initial projects. Though I definitely had to put in a lot of work until I could confidently call myself a UX designer. But that’s where I’m now, and although not very typical, I wouldn’t do it any other way, if I could do it again. Every station along the way has given me something of value I can still profit from to this day."

I'm currently a student studying to receive a Bachelors of Art in Art with an emphasis in graphic design. On the side I've been researching and doing as much UX work I can. I often struggle, however, with what to focus on in UX without sidestepping too much into UI/graphic design work."
userexperience,3d32s9,ssflyer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I understand your question correctly. But I assume you do know what the different disciplines of UX are? Just to recap, here's the steps involved in a full UX process (these are the WHATs, not the HOWs):   Research and define site objectives and user needs Functional specifications and content requirements Interaction design and Information architecture UI and information design Visual design   It's only at step 5 where you begin to actually apply visual design considerations, before that those are of no importance, probably even a hindrance.  Some people seem to have difficulty understanding how much visual design goes into the wireframes which come to life somewhere between step 3 and step 4. I certainly had to learn to ""phase out"" visual design from my wireframes. Some rules I go by to create my initial wireframes. (That is, after I've iterated quickly through variation with pen and paper):   Pixel perfect positioning and sizing of the elements is not important. The designer just has to see which elements are in use and what their priority/wheights are. That's enough information for him to know his boundaries but still have the creative freedom that gives him joy in his work. Round up/down pixel values. Don't place elements which are 32px high. Make that 30. Two elements are 16px apart? Make that 15. You'll save yourself a lot of headache lining up elements. Only use black, white and 2-3 grays  Don't use fancy styling like rounded corners, transparencies and drop-shadows. That's all visual design. Don't wireframe known elements aka Be lazy. Say you know there's definitely going to be a Disqus commenting system at the end of the page? DON'T rebuild the whole thing from scratch with your wireframe style. Just create a big rectangle and name it ""Disqus Comments"". Voilà, now everybody knows what's up and what there's to do. And you had minimal effort.  Only use the default font-type the wireframing tool of your choice uses, just change sizes Use placeholders instead of specific imagery. Say you have a page with several profile images. Instead of going out and spending time on finding cool looking faces to put in your wires, just slap down a crossed-through rectangle with the text ""profile image"" in it's center. Same holds true for brand-logos. Rectangle with brand name in it. Enough.   These are some of the rules I personally try to follow, (though I do brake them now and then), and the results I've gotten through this are fine and have never lead to complaints. Keeping things this simple (and ugly) allows me to rapidly iterate and change my direction and refocus on the fly, without having to waste time on adapting a carefully set up visual language.   As soon as a solution is locked in, I'll gladly redo the wires and create hi-fi versions of them, with more specific pixel measurements, possibly a dash of colouring, thought-out fonts, etc. But that's only when I'm clear on the final direction of the screens."

Some place UX lower than traditional UI or creative design while others are very process oriented UX focused.  I work for a very large consulting agency and typically work 40hr weeks, but am spending a fair amount of time traveling to clients, so family time and balance can be tough at times.   What I've learned at most companies is that people who are unwilling to say no and pressure themselves into working 80 weeks end up working 80 hour weeks.  Just set realistic timelines and be willing to push back on unrealistic  demands and you'll do fine."

userexperience,3cypao,rorykoehler,9,Sat Jul 11 23:59:54 2015 UTC,End. No reason to ask for credit card info for a free trial.
userexperience,3cypao,sevennationsalami,4,Sun Jul 12 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with you. But Mr. Business would likely want to slap you for that answer. It's super user-friendly to say, ""Here, have one month free trial, no strings attached"". But in reality it's more like ""Have a free month on the house, but we secretly hope you forget about it/can't bother with cancellation and slide into paid territory"". That's bad for the user, but businesses in any industry has used this tactic since basically always. I hate it so much, I usually cancel my plans the instant I start them, exactly because I tend to forget the auto-renewal after a month/year/trial.  An issue like this is tricky, because UX and business are in stark contrast to each other. And looking at the numbers (like /u/gofastrightnow has shown), going credit card first is business-wise the way to go, even if I as an UXer completely disagree.  Here's another counterintuitive example:   I'm currently freelancing at a company (career portal) that launched a daily customisable newsletter several month ago. (It's not the project I'm working on, but we get updates in stand-up meetings). Subscription rates have been OK-ish, but not great (not because the newsletter is so bad, but because their users are not aware of it). So they've started batch-subscribing users from their existing user-base (several millions) to the newsletter. THE USERS SUDDENLY GET THE NEWSLETTER, COMPLETELY UNREQUESTED. There's not even a prompt like ""We've selected this particular newsletter for you, because it fits your interests). The newsletter just appears in the inbox, without explanation.  Incredulous I said this was bad on so many levels, definitely a source of frustration and could backfire easily. The guy responsible agreed and said they had approached the issue warily. They initially tested a batch-subscription with 1000 users. And awaited the backlash. But... it never came. So the next wave they added 5000 new subscribers. Again, the users didn't seem to mind. So they constantly upped the ante, until for the last batch mentioned above, they added 500k user to their newsletter in one fell swoop!! Sure, there's people who unsubscribe instantly, some few do complain to the helpline, but these numbers pale in comparison to the people who accept the newsletter as a new thing being part of their experience with that brand and even give positive feedback.  Personally, I'm still torn. I know I'd hate this kind of behaviour from a service I have an account with. Especially if it's a daily Email. But the numbers speak for themselves.  One thing that might come back to bite them in the ass is that the product manager has nice subscription numbers to show in his PowerPoint presentations (yeah, the exact kind of slides you're thinking of now...), but they may be lying to themselves about their worth. Because they where artificially created, not persistently worked for."
userexperience,3cypao,sevennationsalami,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:38:56 2015 UTC,There is little chance of user forgetting about the subscription in my case as it will be the tool that is used to manage all their business processes in a very niche space.

userexperience,3cypao,gofastrightnow,6,Sun Jul 12 18:44:38 2015 UTC,"I fully understand. But UX has to follow and serve business goals, as absurd as they sometimes may be. We should always try to make an argument for a user-centric alternative, but as long as the numbers say otherwise, we'll have to stick to the management plan. Or find a new employer who's business goals are more in line with ours.  Also, personally I have little interest in hearing people preaching to the choir. Meaning, the majority of us in this subreddit will agree that asking for a cc in the initial signup is bad from a user perspective. But nothing is to be gained from constantly patting ourselves on the back and agreeing on the same things. We need to look over our own horizon and see if there's other arguments to be made on a topic. Even if this means acknowledging to not being the all-commandeering driver in a project.  Another example: One of the most insightful posts recently was that one from the guy/gal who actually had the balls to question the usefulness of personas. That post evoked some well-though out responses with great arguments for personas, and I certainly took away a lot of new insights from it. Which I would never have, had we all just continued agreeing that personas are untouchable, even just about sacred."

Switching to a cc on sign up gained 15% more revenue for us with only a small bump of cancellations (3%) with little CSR chatter."

I don't want to tell you to not go to school but consider that times have changed and you have an infinite amount of knowledge and significantly larger community available to you online today than people did 10 or 20 years ago when school was vital to one's success. Continue to educate yourself via book, blog, articles and forums as well as becoming involved in design communities either locally or online and you should be ok.

userexperience,3cpo3k,ehh_d,3,Thu Jul 9 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"UXers are problem solvers. UX is a field that requires a lot of practical experience, because you need to have the criteria to understand what works where and to know what to improve. I would certainly never hire someone who just graduated as a UX. I'd hire you as a trainee, or as an intern, but I would never expect for you to have the knowledge and experience required to perform tasks on your own. You might have the skills, but in UX is about how you apply them.  A background of technology helps because you need to understand the tools available to you, but you could get this with experience.  Get all the experience that you can, in as many varied technology related jobs as you can, only then you can decide which part of UX you enjoy doing: Research, Information Architecture, Design, Development.  You can't call yourself UX anything until you have some serious experience under your belt."
userexperience,3cpo3k,atticus_furx,3,Thu Jul 9 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"You do not need a degree at all. You should probably get one anyway.  Your employment options will be more limited, require more special approvals/exceptions, and your pay will be lower without a degree. There's nothing wrong with a psychology degree in UX; UX is psychology.  Fill in some extra credits with some design/UX-related stuff, psychology of the web/HCI, and learn a few technical, front-end skills besides.    I may want to not go to grad-school right away and instead try to find an ""okay"" job at a company that'd pay for a masters degree later on.   This isn't really feasible at most companies, even those that have policies allowing it.  You simply won't have the time.   I'll have more experience than I currently do   You're actually already making good progress in this area.  Pick up some side gigs, contract work through recruiters, and even volunteer work to get a jump-start on this while still in school.  It's a great way to get experience, and will even yield some side income while you learn in a junior position.   if I'm a psychology major, will a technology company want to hire someone with a non CS/Web-Design related degree?   That depends on how you define a ""technology company"", but there are plenty of organizations out there who value skills over degrees.  Most just want to make sure you've had a degree because it means you've stuck with something for a while.  The fact that it's a psychology degree actually works in your favor in the world of UX; it's not completely unrelated.  I've written about this before.  For what it's worth, this is the opinion of someone who has been in the industry for over two decades, worked at everything from small startups to huge, worldwide consultancy organizations, and makes a pretty good salary; significantly higher than the median for every role I've had in the last decade.  I could have made more, and it would have been easier, if I'd had the degree.  There are still times I consider going back and getting it.  You don't need it.  You can get good, well-paying jobs without it.  But it really helps.  Regarding additional, adjunct skills that will make you a more attractive candidate, here's another comment I've made that explores this, along with more commentary and links about psychology degrees, suggested reading on UX, and what you can do to prepare for your career in this area.  FYI, what you're already doing for experience is a great start.  Make sure you capture and save screenshots of everything you work on, and be sure to get shots of the ""before"" state as well as the ""after"" state, and all of the wireframes (including rough ones), user flows, personas, mockups, and other materials.  This is the start of not only your portfolio, but your ability to document your internal UX process.  This will come up in future interviews, so prepare for it."

You should also show you know a bit about the field in order to a: know what you're potentially getting into and b: to show the hiring manager that you know what you're getting into and are keen to learn more.

Here's how I did it:   When I was undergrad, I joined my university's Human Factors lab and started working as a Research Assistant. Prior to this, I didn't even know the term ""User Experience"". I only knew as Human Factors. After the undergrad, my plan was to obtain a grad degree but I soon realized that the world of UX is pretty much...fucked up. By that I mean..well here, I wrote why it's hard to find UX talent: http://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-UX-talent/answer/Arun-George-42   Anyway, I did hustle a little and did some free consulting until I found a world-class UX company from London. Many of the designers from that company helped pioneer the voice interfaces at Nuance. Now I work to design Voice Interfaces for speech recognition programs like Siri (Fun stuff!).  Psychology is VERY important in User Experience. You'd soon realize that most employers look for a portfolio of work to demonstrate your understanding of UX process.   My suggestion is volunteer / intern at Human Factors lab or HCI lab at your university and if you do your work right, you won't need a grad degree - unless you want to do extreme research, of course.  There's a LOT of UX portfolios out there but don't worry, most of them are just pure rubbish - just gfx designers trying to get hired as UX designers. Any company worth your time will value your degree in Psychology and you could leverage in that manner.

userexperience,3cpcd3,gmpilot,5,Thu Jul 9 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"Some quick unordered thoughts:   You seem to be in a battle with your boss over priorities. You should really put in some effort to clear up the objective here. It's futile to constantly think ""I would do this differently"" or ""I'll implement it anyway"". Proactively approach him and ask if the current system needs changing. If he says yes, you have an official task. If he says no, you have him on record to take responsibility for any consequences. Your notifications seem to be much more important than ""a friend likes your comment"". Maybe they need to take on a new character? Having a daily modal screen showing all notifications forces the user to make a decision. Give notifications a timestamp to show escalating urgency. Under other circumstances this would be highly annoying, but as soon as it comes to liability issues, don't take things lightly. Maybe your system generates too many notifications? It's helpful to see which events are creating notifications and priorize them. Some events may be super important and every single one should count as a single notification. Others may be less important and could be grouped together as just one. ""Empty states"" are often just an afterthought but can be helpful motivators. Like /u/keikun13 nicely said, the ""inbox zero"" of Mailbox is a great motivator for people to start working on their inbox. ""at least that's what my boss tells me"". Again, that's a worrisome relationship to have with a superior and bound to frustrate both sides in the long run. And don't rely on his actions as an excuse. Get clarity about what you need to do. Bug him about it. If he can't tell you, ask his boss.   EDIT: Holy eff', there where a lot of typos!"

A lot of the designs are mobile/web, but there are also a lot of desktop apps, logos, flyers, banners, and unsolicited redesigns in there as well. Plus, you can always get ideas for non-web/non-app design from web/app design. They drive trends anyways."
userexperience,3ckmdc,Vultatio,9,Wed Jul 8 21:36:04 2015 UTC,"and unsolicited redesigns in there as well.   This is why I can't really get behind Dribbble as a UX resource. Sure there is flashy UI work, but the fundamental point of UX is finding the balance between user needs and business needs.  An unsolicited redesign gets to ignore ALL of that and focus solely on UI.  I see so much ""end result UI"" on Dribbble and no actual preliminary UX research, wireframing, prototyping, etc that allows you to actually get to that point.  The best UX people I work with rarely do any graphic design or UI work.  Dribbble is the exact antithesis of UX IMHO. All form and no function."

If you already have access to the data of #1 and are able to complete #2, the worst result is you walk away with a deep empathy for users.     If leadership / decision-makers aren't participating, only the design team will benefit (which is still great, but localized).  In my experience, personas resonate most (perhaps only) with those involved in the interview process. I think this is because personas are simply abstractions of their experience interacting the real people. Try to get leaders in interviews."

How you get from the word ""Availability"" to ""Cut irrelevant info from your design"" is beyond me.  If someone asked me what the secret to good UX was and I said, ""one of three keys is to focus on availability"", how on earth would they ever parse that word or concept into ""Cut irrelevant info from your design""? ""Availability"" is so abstract it could mean a thousand different things.  Here's a better ""heuristic"": be explicit and clear about what you mean, and get to the fucking point - advice that applies to both UX, and articles about UX..."
userexperience,3chpfw,prof_hobart,5,Wed Jul 8 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of reading a book by the guy that came up with these terms back the the 60s/70s, Thinking Fast And Slow, and he goes into them in a lot more detail.  One key bit of the availability heuristic, for example, is that if you can easily recall examples of something then that thing seems more important than if you struggle to recall them. An easy example in Britain at the moment, there was a bad crash on a rollercoaster a few weeks ago. It hasn't changed how dangerous rollercoasters are, but people will for a few week vastly overrate their danger.  One way that can be relevant to your website is that by linking your product in some way to a current news story, you automatically increase the level of perceived importance of your product. It's hot(ish) in the UK at the moment - if you can find any way to associate your product with cooling down, or with relaxing in the sun, you've given yourself a boost. In a few weeks, that'll be irrelevant, and you'll need to find another topical story to link it to.  The point is that this stuff is not just gut feel advice. These heuristics are backed up with some pretty rigorous tests that demonstrate how and why they work (and when they don't)."
userexperience,3chpfw,uusu,3,Wed Jul 8 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%.  I'm currently reading ""On Second Thought"" by Wray Herbert where he lists the most common heuristics.  I guess one of the problems is that if you have know idea what heuristics are, then you're not going to understand this article very well. You won't be able to place it somewhere in your mind, which will leave the reader with a feeling of abstractness. Another problem is, I think, that the article gives bad examples for the heuristics.  For example you can see the the Availability Heuristic in action in the political voting process. Take this list of possible future presidential candidates:   Debra Chambers Pat Sutton Hillary Clinton   Because of the availability heuristic, people are more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton, although you might know nothing about her politics. The mere fact that you've heard of Hillary Clinton more than the other candidates is enough for people to choose her over the others. This means it's really important for a political candidate to 1) Have a name that is easy to remember (catchy) and 2) Repeat it as much as possible.  Now let's translate this to UI Design. This means that if you have two competing products, assuming everything else equal, the one with a more recognizable UI will have an advantage over the other. This is a really good argument to use UI Frameworks like Bootstrap or whole Design frameworks like Material Design or Microsoft's Metro, just because they are more recognizable than your custom design."

userexperience,3chpfw,prof_hobart,2,Wed Jul 8 21:21:44 2015 UTC,"The point is that ""the availability heuristic"" isn't meaningless buzzword bingo.  It's a real term, with a real and pretty clear meaning (that you're impacted by how readily available certain facts are to thought processes) , and with demonstrable effects.  And it means far more that ""Cut irrelevant info from your design"", and it's also not saying ""Give your design high availability"".

Start with who they are, then what do they want, then why, why, why do they want those things.

I do have an issue with them implying that all client meetings are structured the same way, especially considering the following:  Hypothetically speaking: Have you met with this client in the past? Do you have any prior information about the client or not? Are you in the meeting alone or will you be accompanied by another specialist, a developer for example. Is this a review of existing functionality or a presentation on something new?  In General, it's always good to do some research before hand. What they do, what they've created, what their specialty is, who their competition is, what is some of their best work. Attempt to figure out their needs before they express them and be prepared with some solutions and examples. If this is an introductory meeting, you aren't immediately making suggestions, you are only listening.  Initial client meetings are all about introductions, consider this a preliminary ""structure"" if needed: - an introduction to you. - an introduction to your client. - (some like to discuss what the meeting will be about and define talking points at this time) - an introduction to their product. - an introduction to their goals. followed by: - insight on their desired strategy. - questions from the client on your opinion and potential suggestions or solutions. - conclusions: what have you learned, do you understand their needs (important). - actionable items to deliver by the next meeting (also important). Figure out deliverables and next steps, are you / they waiting on something? Set a delivery date and assign task.  At the end of the day, think about television talk show hosts. Be prepared to jump from one point to another using the ""structure"" above but be engaging and interested. Treat it as a conversation and stay cool."

Personas were never meant to be concrete, they have always been living documents which evolve with updated information (albeit not on every whim and fancy) so Agile teams should have no problem unless they're using personas wrong. Personas were always meant to be archetypes, not stereotypes and early developers of personas warned against using stock photos but to actually engage with users and create a rich data document with easy but accurate information accessibility. Alan Cooper himself warned that Marketing personas are NOT UX personas and cross functional use of a single persona is problematic.   If this article is written to remind us of what Cooper said 15 years ago, it does a good job, unfortunately it doesn't also say ""Hey, please read what I said 15 years ago before you start maligning a tool just because you didn't read the manual and you're using it wrong"".    Regardless of what you think of what the ""P"" word has become today, we still need a way to represent and talk about the people we're designing for.

We pull them off the shelf like old bags and try to jam them into whatever sprint we're in and make them work.  UX isn't like that - if you want to improve ROI by reusing a tool in the way you used it before, that's fine, you may get a lot of use out of it but it won't be ideal. Build a habit out of oversimplifying and reusing tools that were designed for other projects and your tools get ossified and start failing.    In an ideal world we design a new user experience instrument for every new context.  But we all know that won't meet deadlines or budgets so we take shortcuts.

Unfortunately Helv fonts look different (read:bad) on windows, so you're better off with not linking to it as it wouldn't solve your problem.

You have project stakeholders who don't really get this UX thing, but they have a lot of opinions on the product and what it should do. Proto-personas basically means sitting down with stakeholders and staying ""who do we THINK our users are"" and having them write down the different types of core users they believe the product has (or will have) and writing a bit about them.  They allow you to start having conversations about UX, and usability and design with your stakeholders. And they are a great lead in to actually doing research. These are good but aren't really personas. They are a useful technique for stakeholder engagement.  ""Personas"", which are still around when you actually are shipping product. You took your proto personas, you had lots of conversations about them, you made lots of important design decisions based on them. You learnt their names and used them to justify what you're doing, but you never actually moved beyond them. You never did any research to create real personas, you just created a short hand for what your stakeholders believe. They aren't users, they are caricatures of what you want to be true. Your proto-personas have become a theory or a religion which you believe in deeply despite a lack of evidence. These are bad and aren't personas, they are caricatures.  You conducted actual generative research to learn who your users are, or what potential users are interested in. You syntehsised that research, noticed corollaries, and started to notice the key design challenges with respect to different individuals. To keep user focused you summarize your research into descriptions of users which you refer to to make sure design is considering the spectrum of users when making design decisions. These are personas, and whilst they don't solve everything, there really isn't anything else quite as good for doing what they do.    Most personas are the second kind, and so people get frustrated and blaim ""personas"" when actually they should be blaming a lack of actual real research. If you aren't talking to users every couple of weeks, your personas are probably the second kind. Conversely, if you think personas are terrible I will guess that you haven't talked to a user this week.  If you DON'T use personas, and you HAVE talked to a user most weeks for the last few months, I'd be really interested to hear how you are recording and sharing your research."
userexperience,3c5lnv,Ezili,12,Sun Jul 5 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"Short Answer  No.    Long Answer  I was fortunate enough to have my first design internship at Cooper. I had learned in design school that Alan Cooper, the founder, is credited with coining the term ""interaction design"" and coming up with personas as a UX technique. Come to think of it, I think he did both in the same book, The Inmates Are Running the Asylum. Definitely one of the most important books from the period when our field was being established. Needless to say, Alan Cooper was a major reason why I wanted to intern there in the first place. (In other circles, he's famous for being the father of visual basic, but to be honest I don't care too much about that.)  Before I began, I felt certain that I knew what personas were and that I was making/using/doing them effectively. I don't think I was a know-it-all, but I really did think that I could do personas as well as any other design method. I thought I understood them. I was wrong. It's not that I wasn't getting anything out of what I was doing, but rather that I just wasn't getting nearly as much out of them as I should've.  In a nutshell, personas should be viewed as tools to constrain yourself to a small set of goals. ""Hey, I just got an idea for a feature that would definitely be useful to a lot of people!"" is the siren song that personas protect you from. They allow you to respond by saying, ""Wow, that feature is a good idea and a lot of people would like that, but would Erica want that? We're only designing for Erica right now."" (""Erica"" being a persona in the scenario I just portrayed, if that wasn't obvious.)  There are lots of ways other ways to use personas. It's not that those other ways are invalid. Alan Cooper didn't invent the word ""persona,"" he just came up with a particular way of doing them that served as the cornerstone of his Goal-Directed Design methodology. So for example, marketing folk will use personas in different ways because they aren't designing new things so much as marketing things that have already been designed, if that makes sense.  One of the most common ways I see designers shortchange themselves with personas is by using them as explanatory tools. The brainstorming has already been done, a direction has been picked, goals have been marked, and the persona is meant to convey all that while simultaneously describing a target demographic. Again, it's not like this doesn't have some value. It's just way more valuable to make the persona before the brainstorming, direction-setting, and goals are coined. The persona should rudely intrude on those all those kinds of things. So instead of explaining things, they should be validating or forbidding things.  Interestingly, my current internship at NASA highlighted in no uncertain terms when personas aren't useful. I'm obviously sold on personas, so when I first overheard one of my senior colleagues say that he had to tell a bunch of students not to bother with personas, I was immediately curious about why, so I chased him down and asked him. It was pretty simple: when you really are designing for a specific person or a sufficiently small team, then you might as well just consult that person or all the team members directly. Of course, you still need to use your judgement here because they might want more than what is actually good for them (the equivalent of someone at a buffet overloading their plate), but the point was that you could directly ask them to rate the utility of different possible features. Or better yet, come up with a test to have them do that will use behavior instead of self-reporting as the determiner of prioritization. But anyway, it's pretty rare to actually be designing for so few people that the persona actually becomes unnecessary. I merely included this because I thought it was interesting (and to show that I'm not just a blindly worshipful cheerleader for personas).  Hope this was insightful. And seriously, get your hands on a copy of that book!"

userexperience,3c5lnv,shoe2020,5,Sun Jul 5 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly decent method for keeping people on track when they are discussing features/systems. If you create persona that represent major elements of your users then  you can talk about them ""How will Aunt Sally be able to use those layered navigations things you just made? She's 84 and is vision impaired."""
userexperience,3c5lnv,metasophie,5,Sun Jul 5 03:49:03 2015 UTC,"This is a key point. When I did kiosk work I created personas for aunt Sally 84 vision impaired and thought I'd nailed it. I failed when I didn't make her 6ft 6. The end result was a kiosk that left people of a certain height practically unable to use the machine. You'll start to realise traits about certain people and how they interact with certain systems. Teenagers often don't know their postcode, human heart beats differ across races, Mexican cash machines are the most complex in the world.  If your personas are 20-30 something smartphone users that look and talk like yourself then yes - personas are bullshit. But force yourself to find an extreme case and start from there. Your research process should reveal this and flow IN to your personas."
userexperience,3c5lnv,orwellsocietyguy,2,Sun Jul 5 10:10:49 2015 UTC,I kind of thought so until u latest project where we have users who purchase very differently based on their job titles and positions. It was helpful to identify and understand their needs. For instance we had teachers who shopped by grade and others who shopped by type. And then we also had user types who can't buy at all but need access to materials to share with people who can purchase for them. Without spelling these out it was easy to lose track.
userexperience,3c5lnv,morli,2,Sun Jul 5 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think people try to overuse personas, but personas are helpful when you have limited resources or need to think about how a certain user base will approach your product. This is especially true if you are designing for people not like you.  For instance, let's say you design for a company that builds financial services software for enterprise. So your users are people who work at hedgefunds or big banks –– not you. Some people will actively embrace technology and love your software, but others will be far more reticent. How do you design for someone who doesn't want to use your product?  Personas are great for situations like these. They're also a helpful starting point for collaborative design sessions or cognitive walkthroughs."
userexperience,3c5lnv,haploscope,2,Sun Jul 5 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"Ezili has the right ideas, here, I think. I know several UXers who hate Personas and are quite vocal about it. But when you interview them about the idea, you find that what they hate is crappy personas.  No UXer would be against using good user research to build abstracts of actors that would actually use their product. That's all a persona is or should be."
userexperience,3c5lnv,legolad,2,Sun Jul 5 04:43:21 2015 UTC,"You're not giving any context but I believe I understand where you're coming form. I've worked on too many projects where ""persona"" was nothing more than a checklist buzzword fancied by the managers (similar to ""responsive"" or ""mobile first""). Because it DOES sound like it would make sense to think about them, right? And it's always nice to have a slide or two in the customer presentation telling them about the people you are building the product for. But the problem is that these personas are often developed in a highly dubious way, more fantasy by the management than developed by UXers based on research. These personas are a joke and after being made never really matter again for the project. The only thing they do is take away time from the project for seemingly no benefit. These are the kind of personas which can be labeled useless. But as /u/Ezili has nicely stated, there's a huge difference in interpretation and worth of personas and if done correctly, they're mighty valuable.  Now, how about you give us some arguments as to why you came to your conclusion?"

userexperience,3c65ix,oddible,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:23:16 2015 UTC,"Really great resources in this post.  Note though that UX, like anything, is a practice.  You need to DO it!  Being able to regurgitate the things you read in these books will help you talk the talk but it won't let you know whether you like being a UX practitioner and it won't show that you can perform the process.    @metasophie's advice to ""design everything"" gets you there - make it your practice.  If you run into a bump in your XBOX One UI, jot down the flow where you encountered the problem, document the use case, evaluate whether that use case is common, examine what kinds of users will be performing that use case, mock up a simple wireframe that improves the process.  Ideally you'd do some research about the users, and you'd test your mock-up multiple times, but for quick stuff where you're just practicing, getting into the habit of framing the problem and ideating is helpful.  But don't stop there, like indicated above, look at ALL situations where you can apply UX!  Service design! Have a problematic experience buying a shirt at the Gap? Apply your UX skills to design a better flow with more ideal touch points.  Look for unique situations where you can apply design thinking and human factors evaluation.  You can't go wrong with an HCI Master's degree, the field is getting competitive, at least in major metros.  Take an elective or two and see if you like it before committing.

Ans: Any field can help if you could persuade the employer. For example, in a typical UX role, there's a lot of business analyst type of work such as finding the business requirements / context gathering. You could use your business understanding to take advantage of this.  ""If not, is a master's degree crucial to success in the field?""  Ans: No. A Master's not required but if you are enrolled in a HCI program, you could take advantage of your university's resources and get connected faster.  ""What can I do as a college student to help my career pursuits in the future and make myself a desirable job candidate?""  Ans: This really depends on what you want to do in UX. I was a Research Assistant at my uni (undergrad) for their Human Factors lab. Even that didn't get me work. So I ended up doing some free consulting work and finally landed with a world-class UX team in London.  So work on some UX projects to build a portfolio / free consultation.

Most UX portfolios you find are just pure nonsense. They are UI designs and some do include ux process.  So now the question is how can I hire someone without a portfolio? The answer is to ask the candidate to pick a project and walk through his or her design process. I can easy figure out whether the person knows his or her stuff. This'd only take a few minutes.

Maybe 5-10 years ago that would be the case but the number of top notch schools pumping out amazing HCI grads today in every major metro is more than enough that I don't have to hire a completely green junior anymore.  Most metros have schools with HCI / IxD programs that are teaching fantastic UX process, and producing amazing portfolios that show that these students both know how to evaluate user experience, design for user experience, have done an internship during their program and gotten some work experience, and produce the information design necessary to communicate their findings to stakeholders < that is HUGE, I can't overemphasize the necessity of people in the field being able to communicate well, and the portfolio represents an artifact that shows that new UX practitioners can consider their audience and produce an informative document.

Or do you want to create a sustainable business model? Because the current and earlier issues with Reddit all hinge on the latter."
userexperience,3c2rix,sevennationsalami,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:09:47 2015 UTC,What I mean by 'design an alternative to reddit' is that I would like to get an understanding of what members of the community find valuable and what they would improve upon and use that information to design a bunch of different ideas to test with some low-fi mockups and prototypes. Monetization is part of any business and will be a fun component to look at more in depth.
userexperience,3c2rix,SamSlate,-2,Sat Jul 4 13:00:31 2015 UTC,"so, this is SUPER early stage, but I'd love some feedback on my ""reddit skin"" for lack of a better word.    information design: why do I need to click on every single image to enlarge it? Your ""engagement metrics"" don't improve my experience, don't waste my time.  make every image as physically large as possible from the start.    the entire site is built around this single principle.   scrolling > clicking: There's no reason to wait for every image or video to load individually, you can queue up 25 items and load them while I stare at the first one, I'll just slide past the ones i'm not interested in.  a faster way to the deep-subs: site lists the (<25) most recent subreddits OP has made submissions to after every post- this means with perfect distribution a given page (of 25 post) yields 25x24 unique subreddits a user can explore. I've been on reddit for the better part of 2 years and i've found more subreddits in the last week than the 2 years prior.    Right now users have to gauge their interest in a sub by it's title, I'm experimenting with the notion/implementation of thumbnails which might express a subreddits content..   monetization model: none what-so-ever.    where this site really shines is on big/content centered subs like wallpapers (or museum). You may not have noticed it at first, but there is no scroll bar on this site (without scroll action), this is not an accident: Fullscreen(f11) and hit any of the ""red v"" 's on the wallpapers sub and (assuming you're monitors 1080p) you'll fill every. single. pixel. on your screen... this sub basically defined how content is displayed.   the other place it shines are nsfw posts, for all of the above reasons.  DRAWBACKS   There is no commenting, or loggin in. I'd like to add them, but tbh oAuth is where I get a little out of my depth. I might just use one of the comment embedding jscripts on github. Or suck it up and learn how to reddit API like a man. some pages will crash your mobile device. maybe even your desktop. It can load up to 25 x 1080p x 60fps movies at once, and that can fuck your shit up. want to test your system try out gfycats sub or even more taxing (and nsfw) 60fpsPorn. not everything can be embedded ...god knows I tried.   let me know what you think! Keep in mind this is early stage and I have a long list of changes/features to add, but might as well test the waters. feel free to comment or pm bugs and suggestions.   enjoy!  edit: douche-ectomy."
userexperience,3c2rix,sevennationsalami,2,Sat Jul 4 23:40:21 2015 UTC,"Some quick thoughts:   No one is impressed by your obnoxious bro language and attitude. Your suggestions will instantly be taken far more seriously without it. You're selling it wrong. Focussing mainly on big images can be a valid use-case, but only one of them. One of the most core element of Reddit has always been allowing for an explosion of chaotic conversation. If this is just an afterthought in your redesign, then you lose one of the very strength of Reddit. You can embrace big images and define them as your central feature, but then shift the focus and make a ""Reddit Image Viewer"" not a ""Reddit Grand Makeover"". Currently you're definitely not delivering on the latter and bound to frustrate your users and their expectations. Do not build features based on assumptions and your own habits (""have 1080p monitor"", ""will use in fullscreen""). That's one of the core elements of UX. Really get to know your audience and give them something THEY want, not just something YOU like. Don't preemptively promise big features to be added in the future. Start small with a well thought out core package. Then add more later, if people ask for features. Big images = slow loading speeds = unhappy mobile users. There's a reason Reddit is text heavy. It allows for fast loading speeds and scanning over a lot of content in short time.  Reddit Enhancement Suite already offers a lot of the functions you're trying to bring to the table. I think your effort is admirable, keep at it, but put in some more focus."

You're in the same boat as about half of the people I see posting here; Graphic designer trying to break into UX.  Your projects talk too much about the ""look"" of the applications and websites. You very briefly discuss a problem, but don't discuss your process, the outcome or how your design solved the problem.  You need to tell a story."
userexperience,3bxchq,Fractales,5,Thu Jul 2 23:05:42 2015 UTC,This is THE reason. You would do much better with case studies in your portfolio. Talk about the client and their problem. Talk about the user and the client expectations. Show initials drawings and reasons you solved the problem certain ways for the user.  Showing sites with no explanation lets us assume you had free reign to do what you wanted. I should be seeing constraints. Issues with technology or users or project scope and how you solved them. More constraints! That's what actually makes this job difficult!  Much more writing would go a long way. Search around behance for ux designs.

They let first class board, and then this mysterious group 2 –– basically, everyone who has a United credit card or possibly status with them, which is actually a huge swath of passengers –– and then window (group 3), middle (group 4), aisle (group 5).  Group 2 really messes it up, but as /u/iamflatline points out, it's important to cater to frequent flyers.  But hey, good going, United."
userexperience,3bvewe,haploscope,3,Fri Jul 3 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"Nice. While I appreciate it, I suspect nothing will come of the research.

My guess is while we are all cramming our way through stuffed, undersized isles, the pilot & crew are running down their checklists."
userexperience,3bvewe,chance--,3,Thu Jul 2 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"I fly at least 4-6 times a month. The big problem I see every week is there is simply not enough overhead space on planes if everyone has a carry on. Casual flyers don't think twice about bringing on extra small bags or oversized carry ons and those add up fast when you have 50+ people in groups 4 and 5.  So, ultimately, someone is going to have to check a bag at the gate, and airlines will bend over backwards to make sure that someone doesn't have frequent flyer status.  Most airlines cater to frequent flyers like myself because we will pay - regardless of price - since we're expensing it to our clients anyway. This is a massive revenue stream that can't be ignored. And your frequent fliers would be pissed if they didn't get an overhead spot for their luggage because it means they have to wait another 20-30 minutes for the luggage carousel in the terminal, assuming it even gets there in the first place.  So to keep them happy they let them board first.  Honestly I would rather get to my seat, start my nap, and have to wait 10 extra minutes for groups 4-5 to finish boarding then have to wait 30 minutes or risk losing my luggage.  Basically the software equivalent is that major carriers tailor their service to the power users (frequent flyers) to the detriment of casual/irregular travelers because the power users are a more profitable/regular stream of revenue.  Low cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier have popped up to better serve casual travelers. And even they are trying to wring out as much money via fees as possible (and have terrible customer service/cancelled flights) because it's STILL not as lucrative than catering to frequent flyers."

EDIT: so this also means that Medium doesn't have to worry about managing storage of passwords on their end either. They've effectively offloaded that responsibility to e-mail providers, Twitter and Facebook."
userexperience,3buhy5,RenaKunisaki,2,Thu Jul 2 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, all these negative responses.  For me this would be pretty convenient. On my PC I have my mail open in a browser tab at all times, so there wouldn't be any extra password involved. Just switch tab, click link, and let a filter automatically delete it afterward. On my mobile devices, new email pops up a notification, so again just tap, tap, and I'm in.  It might be annoying if I had to do it frequently or if it were for some unimportant account, but it sounds like this is for authorizing publication of an article on your account, so not something you're doing 10 times a day and don't care about protecting.  There should still be the option to use passwords instead, but this is a pretty nice feature.  People seem to view email as only for formal, non-realtime messages, but it's one of the best messaging platforms around. It's easy, widespread, versatile, not tied to one central server/provider/brand, and available for free (with Gmail, Yahoo, most ISPs) or cheap (plenty of providers out there). Anyone can just go create as many accounts as they like without having to provide a ton of personal info, or even run their own server. You can attach files, encrypt messages, include a subject, use HTML. It's simple to CC, BCC, forward and back up, it costs nothing to send or receive messages, and you only need to give someone a short text string for them to be able to contact you. (And that string is a name of your choice plus a domain name, not some randomly generated nonsense. Easy to memorize, write down, and spot typos.) It's not quite instant but messages are usually delivered within a minute or two, and the recipient doesn't need to be online at the time. There are tons of great clients (many of which are open source) for every OS made since the 70s; it's a well documented text-based open standard protocol. The only real issue is spam, but most providers today are pretty good about filtering it.  If these ""click to log in"" messages start to become common with some standard-ish format, I can see developing an app to automatically deal with them, so logging in could be as little as one click (to send the email, then the app automatically reads the message and does the rest), or you might set it up to ask for a password (one password for everything) or key fob or etc. (Maybe you can even give the site your public key and have them encrypt the message, so even if someone got into your email they wouldn't get into the other services.)  tl;dr email isn't just for getting memos from your boss; this feature is a pretty great idea, and I don't understand why people see it as such an inconvenience. (But it should be one option, not the only option.)"
userexperience,3buhy5,RenaKunisaki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"IMO if they include both options (email login and password), it could just get confusing.   The only way I can see that working is if you have an optional password field which means you'll need some kind of indication to tell the user about the 2 ways to log in. You'll have to let them know they can do either/or, and if they don't enter a password then they have to check their email for a login link (that could be in the user's spam box). You also have to let them know they have the option to log in conventionally with their email+password.   To me, that sounds pretty unnecessary if most people use a password manager or type it in every time.   Also, I've never heard of anyone saying they wished there was a faster or better way to log in to a site before. This method isn't any more secure or more efficient than the current one as far as I can see. As you said, if this DOES somehow become more popular, there will need to be a way to automate the process cross browser and cross platform. But at the same time, how comfortable will you be if one company/app has access to a bunch of your login information? I think it's akin to not keeping all your savings in one bank.   Just rambling and writing down my thoughts, I'm not trying to say you're wrong or anything."
userexperience,3buhy5,dzkn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'd be confusing. You'd create the account like usual and have the option to set a password, email address, or both. When you go to the login page, it'd send the email (if you have that enabled) and also prompt for a password (if you have one set); either entering the password or clicking the link in the email will log you in. (Or you could require both as a crude form of 2-factor auth!) As long as the login and account creation pages aren't poorly designed, and give decent explanations of the available options, it shouldn't be confusing.  Having one email address be the access key to all your other accounts isn't a good idea, but how many sites offer a ""reset/forgot password"" function, which emails you a new password or a link to reset it? Your email is already a master key, so this wouldn't really change anything. (Both cases can be mitigated by using multiple email accounts and/or having the login link be encrypted.)  As for apps, again the browser is already in that position. A dedicated app which just reads (and maybe decrypts) certain emails, extracts the link contained within, and presents it or passes it on to the browser would be considerably more secure than the current method, because it could be a very small, simple app with a minimal attack surface.  Browsers as they are now are pretty much giant security holes waiting to happen:   They have access to everything They store shittons of personal information, passwords, tokens, history, etc They download and parse/decode/execute hundreds of different types of files and protocols from untrusted remote systems (often over insecure connections); e.g.: HTTP headers, HTML, XML, XSLT, XUL, CSS, Javascript, JPEG, GIF, PNG, SVG. web fonts, MP3, OGG, FLAC, WAV, MIDI, MP4, WebM, WebP, H.264, RSS, WebSocket They perform about a zillion different tasks: fetch files over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP; parse/decode all of those formats; manage ongoing connections/uploads/downloads/WebSockets; make DNS requests and interpret the responses; render text in hundreds of different languages (including complex combinations of characters from multiple languages); manage the page layout... They interact with pretty much every component of the system: accelerated 2D and 3D rendering, audio/video decoding and rendering, font rendering, file I/O, keyboard input, mouse input, audio/video input, joysticks, window manager, networking (duh), user profiles, crypto key storage, threading, drag and drop (e.g. dragging images/files from your desktop into the browser or vice-versa), session management, location services (e.g. GPS on your phone - websites can ask for your location), push notifications... They typically run under the user's normal account, meaning they have read/write/exec/delete access to all that user's files (e.g. all your saved photos, bank statements, Bitcoin wallet.dat, other browsers' profiles and cache, executables you've saved in your home directory (which is common on Windows), your Trash/Recycle Bin, removable media...) Most of this is done within a single massive process with virtually no separation or isolation of privileges (Chrome does use multiple processes, but they all have the same privileges) They're usually run with closed-source third-party plugins (such as Flash which itself is known to be less secure than a vault made of bread) and extensions (and now they have EME specifically to support those!) They literally download and run arbitrary programs from untrusted third parties (Javascript, NaCl, WebAssembly) - of course these are sandboxed, but not well (they're intentionally given all sorts of abilities they really shouldn't have, they can trivially DoS the system via resource exhaustion, they run within the browser process, exploits are not uncommon at all)   The attack surface of web browsers is incomprehensibly huge. Moving security-critical processes such as authentication out of the browsers and into small, single-purpose apps that can be properly isolated and aren't exposed to a lot of untrusted content is a big step toward improving that.   most people use a password manager or type it in every time.    Most? Really? I think the vast majority don't use one, unless you count the browser's ""remember my password"" function (which is specific to the browser and the device). Those who do might not get much use out of this feature, but that doesn't mean nobody will.  This would also be useful for sensitive things that require extra confirmation, like confirming a purchase order or deleting your account. Those things typically ask for your password again (even when you're already logged in) and inhibit the browser's auto-fill feature (else it would defeat the entire point of the confirmation); they might send an email instead.  Also, here is a blog post (with links to other posts) about the same idea, so at least someone else has thought of this before. (Also remarks on how your email is already a master key.)  No hostilities intended; it's nice to have a civil discussion about this kind of thing!"

If it was seamlessly integrated, as in a user could know they have both options to log in without being prompted, then I wouldn't mind it. Different strokes for different folks. As long as it doesn't detract from my experience (as a user who types in their email and password everytime) and I don't have to put in any extra effort to disable email login (basically as long as this feature is relatively hidden for me but prominently displayed for users who use email login). I just don't see how they could do it off the top of my head.   As for the security issue, you seem to know what you're talking about haha.

With this new system, Bob won't be able to access your account without your e-mail password as well. Same situation. Bob gets your e-mail credentials. To access your account now, he does the whole ""forgot my password"" process and gets into your account. You then have to change your medium password and e-mail password. With the new system, you'll still have to reset your e-mail password. The only ""upside"" is that you don't have to change your Medium password, but since you don't even enter it every time anymore it doesn't even count as an upside."

They don't really understand it, but they think they need it, so there you are. Most schools are set up with external relations/marketing groups that were traditionally print focused - they would work on mailers, magazines, and other materials. Then, they might have been involved with the launch of their first website. Then, they might have been involved with subsequent redesigns, perhaps even hiring some new positions to help respond.  But the legacy print people might still be there, and they can present a massive problem for UX. Your job will be to advocate for your users. You should be an absolute expert in your property's Google Analytics (or other behavioral data). You should extract how people are using the website (I'll give you a hint - it's more than likely a funnel that ends with applying) and try to get people in the organization to start thinking about how to best serve those needs.  The problem is that marketing departments think that if you throw some pretty pictures and testimonials at someone that they'll have all the information they need to apply. They think a user goal is to ""become informed about all of the great things your institution offers"" - well, when you're working with the behavioral data, you'll see a much more vivid picture of how your site is being used. When there are meetings about the direction of the site, be prepared to counter people that say stuff like ""I think we should put a carousel on the application page"" or some such nonsense.  Anyway, good luck, start with the user information, be careful with the internal politics, and maybe you will be able to make a big contribution there :)  Edit: realized I assumed all of this on marketing when you said web services - where does web services sit?

The three things that stick out for me at first glance (desktop, 1920x993) are background video, the use of screen retail, and the live scores/blog section on the right.   background video doesn't add anything to content other than provide a dark background for the white news text. Might as well use a static image. Left side of the screen is empty and all the content (news, live scores) is squished to the left. Either expand the news section to fit the majority of the screen or move it to the left side. Left align text is easier to read as well. Live scores/blog section feels extremely narrow. Live blog text is also pretty small, had to strain a bit to read it. Huge space after each tweet as well, really awkward to scroll past.   A few other small things:   There's a search bar beside the IBM logo at the top, but no indication that it is one (I guessed it was one but had to test it out to make sure). Weather is displayed at the top, but the clock is displayed at the bottom. It would feel more natural and normal if those two were grouped together. There's a little carousel for the shop near the bottom which also has no indication that it is for the shop. IMO it isn't needed and just clutters the screen even more. If it has to be there, then might as well have it scroll so I can see what they sell other than Men's Towels.

userexperience,3bnc4g,babababrandon,26,Tue Jun 30 16:32:11 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people have this disdain for ""unicorns,"" but speaking as an industry veteran, front-end coding is one of the best skills for a UX person to learn. It gives you insight into what's programmatically possible, allows you to more easily communicate with developers because you can speak the same language, and no one's ever been laid off because they could code. Back-end or full stack is useful but not nearly as relevant, but understanding front-end development is a great asset."

userexperience,3bnc4g,ssflyer,4,Tue Jun 30 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"For me it went. Graphic Design > Web Design/Coding > User Experience. I mean, I thought about user experience when I was first getting into web design, but not on the level that I do now. Now it's at the core of every website that I build. And my graphic design background helps make it pretty."
userexperience,3bnc4g,Captain-Douche-Canoe,3,Tue Jun 30 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"I think /u/Oaklandia hits the major points.   I've noticed, however, that a lot of people set up design/development as a dichotomy - a false one - but nevertheless as two opposites on a spectrum. They tend to undervalue the other's contributions and minimize and trivialize the job that each does. People in the middle are regarded as less competent by both camps because of that. I think it's a terrible shame; design and development are both highly creative and intuitive fields that  complement each other well."
userexperience,3bnc4g,atrophying,3,Wed Jul 1 02:19:34 2015 UTC,"I think there are two issues:  1) Job notices looking for someone that has: advanced ethnographic research skills, Ruby on rails, java, a broad understanding of motion graphics, and logo design.   Now there might be a few people that fit that bill, but there aren't that many and it probably means the actual role that they are hiring for is either the work of a team or not properly defined.  2) Also, many ""unicorns"" are actually jack of all trades and masters of none.  Sure, there are a few folks with advanced stats knowledge, qualitative research experience, design work, and front end skills, but most people who do all of those things are only really good at one, a couple, or none of those things."
userexperience,3bnc4g,Oaklandia,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:58 2015 UTC,Very much agreed. I'd say I've learned more about design at my web dev internship than I ever did at a design job. In a lot of of ways coding forces you to engage with design on a level which is harder to do purely through photoshop and sketch.

Whenever you have careers with low(-ish) barriers to entry or vague skill requirements, you always get a ton of neophytes who will start to refer to themselves as x, or y and tank the value of labour over time.  I'm a PM who works in digital products, and I get emails every day from ""UX Designers"" about what credentials I look for for new hires. These people often with no degrees in anything relevant (no HCI, ID, etc.), nor any experience outside of a certificate that they paid $7000 where they learned how to draw squares inside of a prototyping program.  If I were you, I'd continue on your path, but start to learn how to code (I'd try PHP, and go hard into Javascript (with jQuery, etc.)). It'll make you a better (and more valuable) UX Designer too. UX is a valuable skill, but when the market cools off (and it will; it's still riding the wave of a lot of employers (in particular, those outside of the digital space) not knowing what a UX Designer actually does) it'll be difficult to find a job amongst all of the people who are flooding into it right now because it's got buzz."

If you want to understand users few of the UI coding skills will help you, in fact, implementation details can be a distraction from good UX. Are there as many jobs in UX that aren't also UI design, nope.  Are there UX research jobs that do not involve design? Absolutely and plenty of them.    So the question is, what do you want? A UX / UI design role? Then keep coding.  Or a UX / Human Factors research role?  Then get out of coding and keep on your research / product management path."

userexperience,3bnc4g,MadCervantes,4,Wed Jul 1 00:17:21 2015 UTC,"| My co-worker said that I should try to focus on learning more actual programming languages and more back end so I'll have a better chance at getting jobs in the future.  I find that typically people who are programming tend to encourage people to program. Your friend is on the right track that having programming skills can definitely help at least get a job. Encouraging you to learn back end programming is really overkill though. There is plenty to learn for front end development and it compliments UI/UX design.   Here are a few light descriptions of factors that I have found effect the UX part of the job:  Size of the company. Typically smaller companies have smaller teams or even a single individual. These places love bang for their buck so if you have development and some UX background they will be very excited. The issues with this is typically they dont have a large budget for UX and you will get pulled into dev work more. Larger companies typically have larger teams and budgets so they may have more specialized roles like Jr UX designer/researcher/engineer. Why go to a smaller company? Well... depends on how badly you need a job, if the project looks interesting, or if there are any other benefits they are offering.   If you are working on websites or applications I'm self taught and no one explained to me when I got into UX that a majority of UX jobs are website design. Of those it typically calls into marketing or internal Sharepoint-like sites for large organizations. Things like Information Architecture, conversions, and A/B testing seem to be very relevant. Web Applications can be very different beasts because many times people aren't being marketed to and understanding their context, workflow, objectives may override things like visual design. For web applications you might be stringing systems together or working on making existing systems more streamline and measuring that improvement. Again depending on what the project focus is the skills for the job may differ.   If the UX job is part of an engineering department or if the engineering is outsourced.  I find that many marketing companies outsource the engineering to 3rd partier or throw design ""over the wall"" to an internal engineering team. In those cases you may not need any development background. Depending if the UX role is on an engineering team or external can effect how much development experience you are expected to have. I work on an engineering team and find engineers work far better if you can at least follow along with the problems, issues, and complexities that may arise when using different frameworks and technologies. I find it better for negotiating technical issues although many pure UX types argue you shouldn't take technology restrictions into consideration. I think it depends on the project price point but its important to try to keep yourself thinking outside the box.   WTF does UX mean to the company? Ok... UX... User Experience. Heres the deal... if you apply to a place that has an established UX team, they are going to be very particular about what UX means, what role you have, how its advertised, etc. Typically these groups have budgets for testing too. To purists UX typically doesn't require coding. However places that do not have an established UX team you are being hired by someone in marketing, engineering, sales, or even straight up human resources. They have keywords, they have an article from Quora telling them this is the thing they need to do, they have a stakeholder somewhere in the organization that told them to do it or they themselves think the position might be useful. You may or may not know more about what UX is than the person hiring you. Depending on how comfortable you feel with what they describe the position as and what you know it may be UI design, information architecture, requirements analysis, UI development, Marketing analytics, and the list goes on and on.   Also note: Some places (especially DoD - god save you) its in vogue to have a UX/UI designer on a scrum team. In the case of DoD to qualify typically you would be required to have work experience or some sort of college/technical training proving you can develop. That doesn't mean you would develop on those teams. I know that sounds confusing... it doesn't make any sense... its the US government.   I would note your location is going to have a huge impact on what companies are available but I cant give you any advice beyond that.  Get on indeed.com and look at job openings and places you think you would like and see if you have the skill sets for them. For the record I work on web apps and am on a team of about 10 engineers and do not develop. We just hired a really smart grad who had a psychology undergrad, HCI masters, and then did a development bootcamp and he is in a hybrid role where he gets to split his time between front end development and UX/UI work.   If anyone has anything to add or other opinions please post. Would love to hear them."
userexperience,3bnc4g,chromarush,2,Tue Jun 30 18:35:11 2015 UTC,"I have about 6 years experience in UX and as a backend developer. If you are passionate about UX then stick to UX. If a company wants a person who knows both front-end and back-end, then they may not be the best place to work at anyways. Good companies hire the best designers and the best developers that work together seamlessly. Yes, you should learn just enough code to be dangerous, but that is the thing, it is dangerous. Back-end programmers should be the main ones coding. Coding takes years to get right. You need to learn design patterns, architecture best practices, and other things that take years to get right. Same thing with UX. If a company wants to be successful, they will pay well for you. UX drives everything. Take that away and you will have an app that works, but solves no real problems."

While it's true that you won't need it for some UX disciplines, there are others, such as interaction design or rapid prototyping, where it will come in pretty handy. Not to mention the fact that being conversant in the language and concepts of programming and web development will go a long way toward winning the respect of certain team members and/or stakeholders. I can't tell you how many times I've been able to make a difference, win an argument, or just get consensus because my programming experience won the respect of the development people in the room."

You should keep up-to-date on whatever platforms you design for, and not treat that as a trivial part of your job that'll seep down to you - it's an active process.   But... I often see this sub (and your post) talk about web like it's the only code you'd need to know. I design primarily for mobile... Should I know how to code both IOS and Android apps? Most developers don't do that. We also have a web version of our product, so I'd need to do that too... At some point this is a ridiculous expectation.   I would learn...as much as is interesting and engaging to you. Talk to people in different jobs and see what sounds cool to you, and then educate yourself to the level you need to get the job you want. No one will be MAD at you for having a skill, that's asinine, but if you don't want that to be a significant part of your job, don't set yourself up for it. Some amount is necessary, or you'll be a shitty designer, but beyond that you're the master of your destiny."

I have a theory as to why this is happening:  UX is a rapidly growing industry / career path right now. With that have come a lot of growing pains. Thus, it's easy to pick a growing pain and criticize the UX industry for it, and because the UX industry is trending, your criticism will likely gain a lot of attention. These people are merely capitalizing on the cheap gains and publicity that they can get from these quasi-criticisms. Don't get me wrong, some of these articles do have legitimate points (this one doesn't really), but we have to recognize that all of these criticisms are really just pointing out the fact that the UX industry is growing and maturing. Nothing to fuss over.   With that said, if you want to become a UX designer, be happy, because you already are!   This line also clearly demonstrates that the author has not even a remote understanding of what UX is, even at it's most elementary level. We can safely assume that this is why he thinks it would be acceptable to classify designers in the way that he proposed. Nothing to see here; move along."

Include some logic that only says days if the value does not equal 1.  (Thus, 0 days, 1 day, 2 days, etc.) As an alternative to alternating row colors, increase the width of the dividing lines.

This seems to me to be an opportunity for you to move up in your role, you mention 'setting up a program'.  Rather than take the juvenile approach of ""omg my manager is asking me to do more work"", why not step up your game and address it as if he's inviting you to move into a more managerial position.  Ask him where he sees the design department in 5 years, ask him if you get more autonomy on budget, ask if you can leverage contractors or if there will be headcount available to you to fill a junior role to take on some of the responsibilities you were previously doing.  Often the responsibility comes before the salary - show you can step up and do the work then you'll get paid for it.  Otherwise they hire someone else to do it and you get to work for that new person, the role you could have had if you didn't get hung up on the amount of work and the money."

userexperience,3bbxp1,WifeOfMike,3,Sun Jun 28 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. First and foremost, Ux and Ui designers are both designers. And designers live and die by the grid. There is no strong, clear grid in this graphic.   Also in design, there's a need for clear hierarchy. Right now the hierarchy goes: characters, titles, then the meat. The characters have way too many details. That much detail (plus the huge size) brings too much attention to the characters, when you want the viewer to be more attentive to the content(comparisons).   The graphic should go: core information (in this case, the differences of UX vs UI), title, then characters. Although some would argue that title is most important, personally, I prefer to emphasize the content. This hierarchy implies, to the viewer, what you should be paying the most attention to.   And when you get into the content of the piece, the information needs to have a clear flow. Kind of like a board game. Right now, because we read left to right, we see ""thought process"", then go to the guy's hair, then go to the thought bubble, then we go back to the guy, see ""task flows, scenarios"", then we skip right over to visual strengths and we go over to the UI guy without finishing Ux. This is very disrupting. It's up to you to decide what the flow should be. Do you want it to read UX guy + info first, then UI guy + info? Or do you want to compare each related trait, one by one? Decide, then distinguish as best you can. Having that flow is critical. If you overwhelm a viewer, like this graphic does, it makes the viewer give up. We're all lazy assholes, we don't want to think more than we have to.   And on the more objective side, as designers, we just can't be cliche. When it comes to making graphics, we have to be thoughtful, conceptual, and just more creative. When designing an infographic like this about a Ux vs Ui designer, go past the initial thought of doing 2 characters and comparing them. That's SO generic. Abstract it, do something that no one's done before. You don't have to be so representational, people understand gestures. For example, the designer for this didn't have to be so descriptive when drawing these 2 characters. Why do you need those shadows on those pants? Or 3 different browns for the shoes? Why are the eyes SO detailed? Also, because of the kinds of clothing these guys are wearing, it creates implied stereotyping. One is a scientist, and one is a french artist. Also are they women, or men? There are too many questions that distract from the actual content.   Ok, I could go on forever, but I won't.   TL:DR:  Consider:   Establish a clear, consistent grid Establish a desired flow Establish Hierarchy, this will facilitate the flow.  Think past the initial surface ideas. Be creative. If you're considering comparing 2 kinds of people, don't think about their appearance, think about the core traits of how those 2 people are different and emphasize that in your design. If it is the clothing, then emphasize the shit out of the clothing, if it is inherent traits, then emphasize the shit out of those."

Anyways, you're describing UI design, cut the bs...  I'm not comparing ux to graphic design... UI design pretty much covers ux. The only time there would ever be two people for each role would be in companies with very very large web / design departments. Very few places have such a large process set up that the UI designer and the guy making wireframes would be two different people. If they are, then they've both definitely done each other's job many times throughout their career.  In 99% of the industry, ux design is handled by the ui designer/web designer, whatever they happen to label the role.

UX Designers who get to take more high-minded NN/g ""ideas man"" approaches are few-and-far-between (to the point of being about non-existent).  But blame the buzz UX has gotten as a ""creative"" field; like, while it is in ways, it doesn't mean that everyone who reads Don't Make Me Think and can spit out wireframes in Axure/Balsamiq can get high-paid ""creative"" jobs.

There's nothing magic about wireframing. It doesn't guarantee a usable site any more than drawing blueprints guarantees the building won't fall down, and wireframing doesn't make you a UX person any more than drawing a blueprint makes you an architect. If you're a UI designer and you think you can do UX because you know how to use Omnigraffle or Visio, you have a lot to learn.   And yes, we have a staff of 15 'web designers' (some UX, some UI) who write no code, because we work for a grownup company. When we finish, we give our work to the front-end developers on our team, who specialize in that skill and are much better at it.

People who do this are devaluing all the specialties that go into building word-class sites. We have built ~15 of 2012's top 100 grossing Ecom sites, and you don't do that with full stack design/developers. You do that with specialists working together.

Interactuve elements that enhance the ui will soon be obvious to you.  Just small things like if i tap and hold this, does it do any thing? Should it do something?   Or if I slide from the left edge of a screen does a menu come out, does it go back to the last page? Should it?   Re- work your apps: Plan your favorite app out from scratch, add features and remove the unnecessary ones.  Then quickly prototype it on paper Then on the computer. Then use it.  Repeat"

Take Instagram - write a sentence mission statement for the app, as if a client had come to you and think about how you might take that forward. What would your research strategy be, who would you interview, what are the competitors doing, what platform would you focus on. Get family friends into user groups and conduct your research.  Take a look at the book Undercover UX by Bowles and Box (my old boss, so I like the book) and perform the exercises in order and write up how it went as a case study."

userexperience,3bb1yx,Chris_Hansen_AMA,3,Sat Jun 27 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"It's a different kind of creativity than say just UI design (though many skills overlap). You definitely need to learn best practices and champion the user, often in the face of business and design goals. I'll give you 2 data input examples, one on each side of the equation.  Form design  There isn't a whole lot of leeway here. Instead of coming up with an innovative way to get users to fill out a form, your goal is often times to guide the user through a sea of fields as smoothly and quickly as possible. Many of the ""good practices"" have already been hashed out and users are familiar with them. No need to get cheeky here, though there is still lots of room for improvement in the industry.  Date picker  Selecting a date, especially in the past, sucks. Every single date picker I have seen has at least one glaring issue. Either it takes way too many taps/clicks, relies on direct input, doesn't validate well, or has what I call the ""Birthday Problem"" (i.e. selecting a date many years in the past). I am constantly on the lookout for a novel solution to the inputing MM/DD/YYYY. It's like a personal mission for me now because I can just feel that somewhere out there is an elegant, innovative solution.    Following best practices is hard enough. Often times design will send a comp that throws all good UX out the window and you'll have your work cut out for you. Sometimes dev will send back an interface because it would take too much effort to implement at the moment. So while you might be less ""right brain"" creative on a daily basis, you'll definitely have to be clever. For me UX is about compromises, and when you have aesthetics, codebase, business, marketing, and user requirements to balance, you'll definitely have to work. There is no copy/paste in good UX."
userexperience,3bb1yx,phantamines,3,Sat Jun 27 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Applying best practices to new situations is creative. Have you ever made something? Congratulations, you're creative! You don't need to have some innate ability to generate ideas (there are techniques for that) or to ""feel"" your way to a solution. You don't have to resemble the artist stereotype. User experience, like all forms of design, is about communication and persuasion. Know your audience and what they want, know what the business wants, and find a way to align those goals as efficiently as possible. It's more like editing than writing."

An example of something I might I work on - how you can portray an accounting system and multiple types of ticket charges in a way that users with no accounting backgrounds can easily comprehend, while also helping them understand what the impact is of changes they make.   For me it's one of the most creative disciplines, because you are taking problems and employing not just type/colour/shape but also the very way that people are thinking about something and developing a model that they can relate to in their own particular way.

userexperience,3b2lci,lilpenny84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:21:48 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I took a look at your site. Unfortunately I do not have any comments about your main question. However, I do have some other design comments.  Your color palette choices are confusing. In certain areas of the page they seem fine and in others there isn't enough contrast between the background and foreground elements. The colors you chose are very loud. I would try refining these and see what it looks like.  I see similar issues with the icons on the page. The ""Top Features"" section has icons that look inconsistent. The Safari icon appears to be the old outdated icon. It is also skeuomorphic while the rest of the icons are flat. Try to be consistent with your iconography or elements will look out of place. I also think that the purple half circles that you used as a background to those icons seems unnecessary. It would probably look better without those backgrounds at all or by simply making a full circle with a stroke instead of filling the background. It is visually distracting to me.  The ""Top 3 Benefits"" icons also bother me due to color choices. Why did you choose that mustard yellow for those icons? I would expect white to produce a cleaner result.  The overall impression I get of the current design is that it is chaotic. I think this is mostly due to the color palette choices. With some slight tweaking this could be a really nice design.   Here are a few examples of Mac Desktop Apps:  http://panic.com/transmit/  http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/  http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/  http://tumult.com/hype/  Hopefully this was helpful."

Bachelor of Cognitive Psychology, Master of UX and Human Factors. No internship, since everything I found was unpaid and I just couldn't afford not paying rent and bills and food, so working part time physical jobs or waiter shifts was at the time the only option I had.  As for giving myself projects, honestly, it's something I hear and read a lot in theory, but in practice, employers seem to consider it as barely better than ""this is a drawing of me playing with Lego"". Then it usually goes:  ""So, what were your metrics?"" ""There weren't, it was a home project."" ""How did you negotiate with the stakeholders?"" ""There weren't stakeholders, it was a home project."" ""Did it got released?"" ""It didn't get released, it was a home project."" ""....Ok, we will call you back."""

(e.g. this designer's writeup of how she redesigned Meetup's member email settings.)

I am more of a designer but I would suggest a bit of research into the flow of how a user might navigate the different elements of your site. I might hold off on jumping into design for better wireframes that show overarching nav. Get a whiteboard out and have people try to complete tasks. Focus more on what the user would want and less on what your site will look like. That will come naturally when you build based on data."

userexperience,3ads3j,FR_STARMER,4,Fri Jun 19 16:42:22 2015 UTC,I disagree.   It depends on your target. I've gotten plenty of long emails (usually just text) that I've read every word of because the content was great and exactly what I was looking for. For most general email blasts short and sweet is a good way to go but if you have a good idea of who you are writing too you can actually craft some long form content and have it be highly successful.

You don't start with the finished UI and then try to justify decisions, if that's what you're asking.  That's the opposite of UX.  Some companies operate this way.  UX happens parallel to everything, it should start when we ask the question ""What should we make?"" instead of ""What can we make?"" You can't apply UX to a product that no one under the best of circumstances will use.  Here is an overview of the UX process."

Really there is no ""true"", but UX design usually follows certain principles that have been proven out over time. Human faces increase conversion rates: proven.  Short sentences for readability: proven.  Social proof increases conversion rates: proven. etc.   So what you see is our version of really what are tried and true conversion optimization techniques.  At the end of the day , nothing is set in stone, but what we did here isn't a reinvention of the wheel by any means, it's simply our application of very simple and widely accepted conversion optimization ideas.  And when it boils right down to it, the proof is in the $$$.  We did $350K in the first year of business.  This stuff works and it's not very complicated to apply."
userexperience,3a3yj8,legolad,7,Fri Jun 19 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"There is logic, however if you ask if there is any proof as to the truth of that logic ... well, its usually a mixed bag. Where you can point to supporting data/evidence that data is often questionable  - UX draws a lot from social sciences as an academic discipline and the replicability of much of the research is poor. Take everything with a pinch of salt. Where the research stems from the physical side of UX (e.g. ergonomics, CS) the evidence tends to be more reliable.   Personally I think that that is a good example of design rationale but a very poor example of UX. E.g. lets take 2, ""call to action"". A UX based design would have examined why people are coming to the site and attempted to make critical paths available to the user with minimal cognitive burden on the user. The rationale presented there is simply the sales goal; what they want their users to do. A UX based design would be talking about what the users want to do."
userexperience,3a3yj8,oddible,2,Wed Jun 17 08:51:16 2015 UTC,"What morphemass said.   And I'll add this:  The field of usability is still relatively young and the disciplines that lead to a good user experience are still being defined. In my career I've watched things change dramatically, but I still find myself working for companies for whom User Experience is at best a quaint mystery.  That said, most practitioners seem to recognize the need for defining the science behind the design and many are willing to have those conversations. So trust your gut. If something sounds like nonsense, it might be. So ask. And keep asking. I've learned so much from other practitioners by just asking them why and how they know."

The use of some elements, like hamburger menus, might be seen as contentious but thats a secondary concern, for me.  My chief concern (as someone who hires in the field) is there is very little about how you got to the wireframes/designs you display. For me UX is as much about the process as the outcome - I'd like to see much more of a narrative around each project, taking the reader from initial brief through the various phases of research conducted, initial ideas through to the delivered wireframes. Just a paragraph on process followed by wireframes does;t tell me anything about how you work or how you arrived at the decisions you needed to make, just how you made them."

userexperience,3a3w9o,KMKtwo-four,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"This can definitely be confusing! Here's a good link that explains it: http://yisela.com/whats-difference-wireframes-mockups/  A lot of times wireframes are in a sketchbook or whiteboard. They are meant to not show too many details as to allow for quick changes and iterations. For example, let's say we drew a webpage on a whiteboard. I use a hamburger menu and assume the settings link will be within (and hidden). Then, I pull someone over and tell them to imagine this is a webpage. I then ask them how to change their email address. If they don't say to look in the hamburger menu, I can redo my design and try to put the settings menu in a different location. In a wireframe, that could take mere seconds compared to a mockup with a lot of detail. Then, you can test again to see if the next person finds it easier. The wireframe is about usability, and the mockup is about beauty. Hopefully that makes sense. Your mockups have a ton of detail and seem like they would be the last steps before the visual design. It would be nice to also see versions that came before them.  I also recommend this class on Udemy.

userexperience,39y0xv,menses_maiden,6,Mon Jun 15 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"A big part of UX is understanding the proper tone for your audience and choosing design/UI elements based on that. In other words, does your customer want something serious/authoritative, or something fanciful/childlike?  The tone of voice you're using in your cover letter is far too informal. (Note your use of exclamation points, non-words like ""floofy,"" and casual language like ""things,"" ""bells and whistles,"" ""really cool,"" ""pretty,"" and ""a lot of."") Regardless of the position that you are applying for, it's imperative that you convey that you are mature enough for the job.   You haven't really said anything about your qualifications. You completed a course under ""a lead UX designer"" for ""a company?"" What did you do in the course? What's the name of the instructor, and what company does s/he work for? What feedback did you receive, and how did you apply it?   There's no structure to your letter. In your second draft, try to answer these questions in roughly this order:   Where can they find your portfolio? (A lot of people put this information in the header underneath their name.) What position are you applying for? How did you find out about this position? What qualifies you for this job? Talk briefly about your education/relevant experience here. What's something interesting about you that makes you uniquely qualified among other candidates (i.e. relevant experience with the company's target audience, research projects, awards...) How do they get in touch with you?   After that, just add a friendly conclusion sentence, and a more formal sign-off than ""Thanks.""  Hope that helps, and good luck!"

It's become a buzz term and especially a buzz word for recruiters to use. There are so many adverts out there for job titles with UX in or job descriptions that mention UX, but when you drill down into it, it's not a UX job really, they're just looking for a designer, web designer or elusive all-rounder.   What I would suggest if you can't find a UX specific job is aim for roles that are relevant but with a company/agency that seems to have a good understanding of it or a dedicated department where you might be able to migrate over to eventually, or a role where you might be able to use UX principles in your job - and then demonstrate to recruiters in future how you have done this."

There seems an obsession in some job interviews with you having vast experience with the particular software that they happen to use in their business, but most computer literate people who understand what the software is for will be able to pick it up. I ended up saying I've wireframed in Balsamiq but often used InDesign because I was more experienced with it so it ended up quicker, but told them I'd used a trial of Axure and would be confident picking it up. Then when I got asked what specific CMS I had used, I pretty much just said, 'look, software and systems are just part of it but I'm confident I can adapt to using whatever I need to use.' Like you say, spend a day with something like Axure or a couple of evenings at home and you'll be fine with it. That said, it can't hurt to make it clear on your CV that you're aware of the industry standard tools or have used them. I made the point of using trials of Axure because I knew other businesses used it but just said my boss preferred other options so I wanted to try it out myself, which I felt made me sound keen and willing to learn."

userexperience,39svid,Hopelesz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I have never designed for a TV before but one thing I can probably say is that all fonts are too small. Might want to think about bumping them all up in sizes if they are going to be on a TV that could be potentially far away.  And most importantly, you want to make sure you have a high contrast ratio to maintain legibility.  Use this tool to put in your foreground color (text) and your background color and make sure you have a passing grade on your contrast ratio. If it says fail then make the text darker, the background color lighter, or both.  http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/  White background with black text produces the highest contrast ratio (and vice versa). But lots of white can be harsh on the eyes. For instance if this TV was in a room with the lights off it would be rather harsh. Might want to think of a really light off-white for background color on the rows to be a little easier on the eyes.  Also check out Google's Material Design color palette for better color options. Design doesn't seem to be your thing so just steal from people that have already done the work for you.  https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette  I don't have time to help with a mock but I think that is some good advice that will start to get you thinking a little more about usability and how it will be perceived by users."

Sidestick control of article  Air France Flight 447:       On 28 April 2012 in The Daily Telegraph, British journalist Nick Ross published a comparison of Airbus and Boeing flight controls; unlike the control yoke used on Boeing flight decks, the Airbus side stick controls give no sensory or tactile and little visual feedback to the second pilot. Ross reasoned that this might - in part - explain why the handling pilot's fatal nose-up inputs were not countermanded by his two colleagues.  Ross's thesis was also broadcast in the U.S.   In a July 2012 CBS report, Sullenberger suggested that the design of the Airbus cockpit might have been a factor in the accident. The flight controls are not (mechanically) linked between the two pilot seats, and Robert, the left seat pilot who believed he had taken over control of the plane, was not aware that Bonin had continued to hold the stick back, which overrode Robert's own control.

Things have changed a lot since then.  Their recent revisions and applications are much better.  When you have a billion users on your platform making a tiny change can cause huge waves, so it just won't be fixed without a major revision.  That and Gmail isn't in a place like Youtube where it actually has to compete for market share and brings in a lot of revenue doing so.  In the end I'd presume Inbox will be merged with Gmail.

userexperience,39ksyn,CreativeDisorder,3,Fri Jun 12 12:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well that really depends on the company and the designer. Mostly UX is done in the digital world. As you mentioned yourself offline stuff is usually designed by IDs. However there are companies that understand User-Experience or Costumer Experience in a broader sense - talking about every touchpoint a costumer/user has with that particular company, and the experience the costumers do have there."
userexperience,39ksyn,klaushaus,4,Fri Jun 12 13:41:46 2015 UTC,"You're talking about Industrial Design and Experience Design - both of these fields deal strongly in the physical realm. I personally don't think this is that far out of the wheelhouse of a (great) UX Designer; sure some things are very specific to the fields, like an understanding of physical materials, manufacturing processes, ergonomics, etc. - but the underlying fundamentals of UX still apply in the physical realm.   Nearly every large product corporation has an industrial design team. Additionally, there are lots of hybrid design studios/firms/consultancies that dabble in both physical and digital product design, like IDEO, Continuum, Astro, Gravitytank, etc."
userexperience,39ksyn,bigjince,3,Fri Jun 12 14:09:28 2015 UTC,"It ultimately depends on where the UX designer resides within the internal structure, but as mentioned, the design of actual, physical products is usually done in ID or something similar with UX complementing those designs. Environmental experiences, on the other hand, are heavily influenced by user research, and could most definitely fall under the user experience umbrella.  At a manufacturing company, I was actually in charge of what is most likely now called customer experience, which was the full lifecycle of a customer before, during, and after the purchase of one of our products. I had a ton of reach there, but the UX of the products themselves was mostly providing information to industrial designers who could then make adjustments to the products themselves."

userexperience,39ksyn,MrDesignerMan,2,Fri Jun 12 15:42:19 2015 UTC,"I helped design the DrumPants, working with a great Industrial Designer who made the Axiom keyboard and other musical instruments, and the design process is very similar. It's all about making prototypes and mockups, and user testing all your assumptions. You make mockups out of foam or cardboard, then give it to different users to pretend to use, just like paper prototyping an app UI.  The trick is, now it's in 3D, so there's a whole new layer of things to consider: how does the user hold it or wear it? How does it fit with different body types and clothing styles? How does the UI of buttons and knobs and screens all fit together?   Take, for instance, a car radio. In the 90s there was a huge switch to digital everything, so in their glee, they started replacing all the analog knobs with buttons. But now the user has to visually look at the radio to be able to hit the volume button, whereas before they could just reach out blindly and give it a turn. (Same with microwaves: I used to have a microwave that was simply large knob to set the cooking time. It was SO much better because starting the microwave was one single movement: a twist of the wrist, compared to pressing a bunch of buttons one after another to set the time, then hitting the Start button.)  If you want to learn more about designing physical objects, I highly recommend the book The Design of Everyday Things. It helped me think about app UIs in a new light as well."

The world certainly needs more brilliant minimalistic design.   I'm now reading through The UX Book, which is fantastic at laying out the UX lifecycle and development process in detail, as well as giving great exercises. It's really something I see myself doing as a profession in the future, however I would detest being limited to digital interaction.  And how coincidental!

How are we serving a customer across experiences, and what can we do to make that experience meaningful? We utilized input from the Customer Service team (including them in blueprinting activities, as well as looking at their data for friction points - number of calls about ""x"", etc.) to inform decisions about projects we tackled this year.   In one example, what was a 50,000 call volume was reduced to less than 1,000 because of one of these projects.   TL;DR - Look at the customer holistically. Customer experience is about engaging the customer across experiences (brick & mortar, over the phone, email, web, etc.) and if you can improve that experience and the transition from one medium to another, this increases customer satisfaction/experience."

Customer Experience is a term that's starting to bloat like UX - it no longer just means ""customer service"" in the traditional sense of the word. In many UX circles, CX is starting to be talked about as the broader umbrella that UX fits within. With THAT definition, UX and CX can be hard to separate, but I like to think of CX as the cumulation of ongoing, omni-channel UX touchpoints an individual might have with a company or product.    If you actually mean specifically customer service, there are tons of examples where UX hits customer services. Think of help lines, live chat, self-checkouts, personal shoppers, etc."
userexperience,39e60n,TriskyFriscuit,2,Thu Jun 11 05:15:21 2015 UTC,"Touching on the UX/CX part...  Personally, I really just break it down into 'experience' -- which really is an overarching concept and who that experience is for.  the terms 'User' and 'Customer' both imply particular channels/interaction methods and goals. The customer can be a user, thus, UX can fit within CX -- especially if the overall customer experience (using the term as a noun) is a concern.  UX isn't necessarily a subset of CX, though. If your company is in the business of selling things, it makes sense that they are. IMO, There is a distinction between the 'pure definition' of UX and UX that has an underlying sales and customer goal."

The UX is how all products in an ecosystem interact to help customers/users complete tasks like buying goods/renewing memberships/subscribing to content. The UX also includes interactions with things like newsletters and help centers. Ideally a company wants to have a unified user experience where a person can transition seamlessly between touch points. Just think of how Netflix accomplishes this.

userexperience,39ccmh,AustinKnightUX,2,Wed Jun 10 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"A quick thought on the purpose that design serves...   Design is supposed to look beautiful, beauty pleases our brains, thus the point of design is to please your users.   I don't necessarily agree or disagree with you, but here is something to think about:  ""Design is not Art.  Art is about personal expression. It is about the life, the emotions, the thoughts and ideas of the artist. It matters very little what observers do, their activity is not required, only their appreciation. The practice of Art doesn’t require them. It is a necessary activity for the artist, and the artist alone.  Design, on the other hand, is about use. The designer needs someone to use (not only appreciate) what they create. Design doesn’t serve its purpose without people to use it. Design helps solve human problems. The highest accolade we can bestow on a design is not that it is beautiful, as we do in Art, but that it is well-used.  Unlike Art, Design is always contextual. It matters when a design was created because of the context of its use: what problem is it supposed to solve? And for whom? At what point in time? This is why design is so related to technology, because technology changes so quickly, so must our designs. A design that worked ten years ago might not even be worth considering today. History is littered with wonderful designs that are no longer necessary.  Great Art, on the other hand, is always in style. We appreciate Michelangelo’s David even though we could recreate a million of them because it was the toil and expression of a single man. That will never fade. Great Design is dependent upon the age in which it is made and the problem which it is meant to solve. But not Art. Art is timeless.  The litmus test. When people enjoy Art, they say “I like that”. When people enjoy Design, they say “That works well”. This is not by accident. Good Design is something that works well.""  - Josh Porter  ""Even the best designers produce successful products only if their designs solve the right problems. A wonderful interface to the wrong features will fail.""  - Jakob Nielsen  ""I’ve been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration—likely because so much bad design simply is decoration. Good design isn’t. Good design is problem solving.""  - Jeffrey Veen  In many cases, I would argue that utility is indeed the core component of design. Aesthetics undoubtedly enhance design, but without that core functionality and usability, nobody would be interested in your design because it doesn't offer them any actual benefit. As Josh said, this is what separates art from design. Art is pleasing for its aesthetic value alone, whereas design is pleasing first for its functional value (and then delight arguably could lie within aesthetics, micro interactions, predictive content, etc.).   ...if you want it to catch on you need to do more than just utility.   The very site that you're using right now is an excellent example of why this is not universally true. Reddit is ugly by many aesthetic standards, yet it's an extremely widely used site for its core unique functionalities and content. Utility comes first, then aesthetics. Both are important. But there is a difference and order of necessity."

I recently had my first one too and despite having read a crapload of articles around online still felt pretty unprepared going into it.  The best advice I can give after having now done 3 of them and getting the role; try and make a framework you can draw on to easily demonstrate/show your working. Who? Why? What? How? List any assumptions you've made and discuss them when you present - show, don't tell etc.  It's hard to give specific advice because they can vary so wildly; they could give you a brief to test your high-level problem solving, or something entirely different and test more of your interaction design skills.  This is all assuming you've been given a brief and are not allowed to ask questions or work collaboratively with them. If you are, definitely ask questions about who will use it and why, really define the problem you're solving and the goals that need mapping, then move up to what is needed and how it would work from there.  Some useful links I found in my search:  https://github.com/humphreybc/designer-interview  http://uxpamagazine.org/onsite-ux-interviews/  https://uxmag.com/articles/finding-and-interviewing-ux-superstars  http://www.uxdesignedge.com/2010/03/why-everybody-is-a-designer/"

userexperience,38zajl,SiliconWrath,9,Mon Jun 8 04:46:46 2015 UTC,The other reason might actually be infrastructure related. Having the server query for all tweets uses more resources than just polling occasionally for the number of new tweets.   Most of the time people won't actually be clicking to see new tweets often enough to come close to the processing required to continually pull new tweets.   It could also slow the browser down a lot if the user keeps the tab open and the page gets extremely long.

I'm also quite familiar with Photoshop and InDesign, and can code/speak in HTML and CSS.  I'm giving it my all, and I plan on breaking in one way or another.

The reason is that a lot of contract positions will let you use whatever tools you are most comfortable with. With that said, Axure is taking the lead (at least in the boston metro area).

I attribute my success to having a provable track record of increasing conversion and revenue, having a demonstrable mastery of a varied many disciplines related to UX, I have spoken at a number of conferences on the subject, and most importantly: I love what I do.   When you love what you do and your enthusiasm shows, people respond positively to that. When you love what you do, you are always getting better at it. One day you wake up and realize that your passion made you successful.   Not having a degree might keep you out of some places if you can't get face to face, but it certainly hasn't closed any doors I was interested in opening.

At least with some sort of higher education you can have some faith that they probably understand the broader spectrum of user experience, it's history, the application of various forms of user research, and how to apply it.   Junior User Experience in the wild is often a hodgepodge of skills and outputs. So, when they contrast your application with others you're going to have to outperform everybody in the same category as you. If you are applying for junior roles you're going to have to demonstrate better user-research, rationalisation, conceptualisation, design, potentially aesthetic sense, and magically transfer your pedigree and depth of knowledge on User Experience, than all of the other applicants.

It might not actually be the same number of clicks if their browser support requirement include browsers that don't have history support (lots of ajax loading and infinitish load on twitter). Not sure about that, but it might not be as simple as you are making it out to be. In addition, clicks are no longer considered the bellwether of web usability they used to be.

This could be a good opportunity to create a quick paper prototype that people can interact with.  It might reduce some of the confusion mrempyrean mentioned.  Is there something critical about TAB-ing into the field?  Can they not use a mouse and click on the field?  Also ""on a web form on a new record"" feels unfamiliar.  Both of those things stood out to me as odd, but I lack a lot of context.  Are you testing an interface where people face those constraints and use that language already?    Finally, since you mentioned you're new to UX, do keep in mind that you should always endeavor to test the interface with people who will actually use it.  Again, I lack a lot of context, but if you're not testing with the users, you're not getting the real picture."
userexperience,38p3nd,garnetbobcat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:59:57 2015 UTC,Yes tabbing is important.  If you click on the dropdown the expected behavior would be to open the list. I'm trying to determine the expected behavior when someone interacts with the dropdown without using the mouse. I would personally prefer to have the list open but it is not a universal pattern. Looking around the web it's mixed between the list opening and not opening.
userexperience,38n5a1,axelut,3,Fri Jun 5 08:09:25 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, this is good one.  Sometimes following a consistency of our app we tend to compromise with some basic principles.  For landing pages the advice says - put the call to action close to the message you think will convince your user. As soon as he makes his mind he will look for the button/link.  The case with missing the form button is similar. Is he done? Then he should be able to submit or go to the next screen as easy as he will be when filling a paper. Close and visually distinguished control allows for that.  Not to mention that he might try to get to the next page (with the action bar controls) without realizing there are more required fields left.  edit: I would argue that placing the SUBMIT on a persistent footer is the best choice. In some cases - yes, but on a touch device if one is placing irrecoverable controls at the bottom, he risk making the user occidentally using the control without actually being finished. I've seen this happens way too often. With the mouse its not a problem, with an accidental touch with a finger - this happens often.  A solution in such sensitive case would be a ""hold for 2 seconds to submit"" function."

And its not only about visual design, fancy interactable components, or super adaptive workflows, with a minimum of information architecture a user can feel a human behind the screen."

However, on some screens, I can't read, or I'm trying to hard to read, the text because the contrast between the text and the background colors isn't high enough. Same with the icons. They're also a little ambiguous in some parts. Finally, just being a picky designer, but your spacing and padding is also off on some screens... for example on the View Friends screen header and hero bars.  Also presentation-wise, I would be consistent with your capitalization. Some sentences you had capital letters, some you didn't. Capitalize the first letter of each sentence in this case no matter what the hipster trend is to not capitalize any words. This makes a huge difference when it comes to presenting your work."

The contact photos you've put up there. snapchat does not use contact photos. Even if it did link the user's user name to their phone number in your phone book, what about cases where there is no photo to display? Over half of my snapchat contacts are people who's numbers i don't have at all.  A huge appeal of snapchat is the ability to not reveal personal information. I'm assuming Ahmed is a friend of yours?

The sad thing is very few customers are willing to pay for usability testing. Even fewer companies are willing to share the results of their usability testing with other companies. So at best we might be able to generalize usability tests we have done but we almost never have access to any usability tests our competitors have done.   The good news is usability testing is extremely context dependent. So coloring the button green for one customer may not make sense for the next customer- that customer may need to have a red button. So unless the customers' businesses are extremely similar, the visuals of the site are  extremely similar, and the interaction being tested is extremely similar, usability testing in one situation often doesn't apply well to another.   Of course there are decisions or interactions that are just bad, and some that are good, but when it comes to testing and analytics everyone is in the same boat. No one wants to share data."

It's easy to create a shitty UX and so damn hard to make a great one. Companies have their own views of what UX really means. A lot of companies hire UI designers and give them the title UX. These idiots actually believe that great UX designs come from making stuff look pretty. There's no universal design process; many of them create their own. Majority of them don't apply cognitive psychology or even read books regarding these things.   And I agree. UX is such a wide field that there isn't a universal set of qualifications and characteristics that separates good from bad designers or strategists. Also since it's relatively new, experience is not a determining factor as of yet. (Someone good might have less time doing UX than someone who has been a terrible designer for 5 years)."
userexperience,38f8xq,atticus_furx,4,Thu Jun 4 20:42:42 2015 UTC,I'm guilty of never studying cognitive psychology but I'm doing pretty good for myself so it must mean I'm doing something right. I have a marketing background where I have experience in user behavior and decision making which I find very helpful in my UX career. So not every UXer has to come from HCI background or consumer psychology background. What I do believe is that anyone can get into UX if they are willing to learn and do what it takes. Any formidable digital agency or tech company would consider UX through the entirety of the project and have employees that think about UX even at a high level.
userexperience,38f8xq,HelloWuWu,5,Wed Jun 3 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, though alas I've encountered people who strongly believe you need a background in X to be a good UX designer. Grr..."

With marketing, there's more romance and woo'ing with pretty things like branding and copy. While both fields care about the user experience and is executed with the same tools and medium, how they arrive to it is a bit different. Not sure if that makes sense or not."

userexperience,38f8xq,uxthrowaway,2,Thu Jun 4 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"Well. It does make you sound like an elitist. There is nothing wrong with people wanting to get into the field. Not everyone wants to break into the field just because it lucrative. It could be because a construction worker likes to think about how things work as a whole and be the person to make some of those decisions. Not every needs to be looked through a negative lens. Everyone has to start somewhere. If an emerging UX designer did not have the skills and experience to be a UX designer, any competent company or agency can weed them out.

userexperience,38f8xq,digitalcth,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:35:53 2015 UTC,One of the problems is that there aren't really any places for emerging designers to start.

userexperience,38cbqq,gamzer,6,Wed Jun 3 08:22:55 2015 UTC,"While FABs seem to provide good UX in ideal conditions, in actual practice, widespread adoption of FABs might be detrimental to the overall UX of the app.   This was even bolded in the article. I think that sums it up beautifully.  You can say just about any pattern that is over used or incorrectly used is bad - but that doesn't mean it is always bad UX or inappropriate for some choice scenarios.  Trying to use FAB buttons on desktop websites outside of an ideal scenario, for example, would be a really poor experience. People could easily start to bend the rules and attach less important or multiple actions in a FAB, also rendering it a less than optimal experience. I think that it can be a great choice and have minimal impact (vs. having multiple large buttons or sticky headers at the top of the page) when used correctly.  You need to know when to use the tools in your toolbox to be an effective designer. This is true for all things, not just the FAB. The goal is not and should not be wide spread adaption, but intentional use in the right circumstances."
userexperience,38cbqq,tokisushi,12,Wed Jun 3 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"While I agree wholeheartedly that FABs are not for every page or situation that does not make them bad UX, his strongest argument is that they take up space, which is true but they don't take up 50% of anything.  One thumbnail in that gallery picture he has 642 px of area.  The FAB has 372 px  1369/4096 = x/100  4096x = 136900  x = 33.4428515%  So thats 33% of ONE thumbnail.   What would be the better solution, taking that whole row off to accommodate for a search button or bar?  Edit: Also I just said screw π and just did area for a rectangle over the FAB. if you want the actual area of the circle its 1075. which would make it 27% of space taken."
userexperience,38cbqq,youcantstoptheart,13,Wed Jun 3 09:45:18 2015 UTC,I think the photos app is actually a good example of the FAB. The amazing search functionality is meant to fix the problem of browsing endlessly to find a photo.  The location of the search button reminds the user that scrolling endlessly may not be the best way to find the photo. It achieves its goal perfectly.

I don't know, I've always worked in-house. Take your best guess, add plenty for padding, and get it better the next time :)  For user testing - try doing guerilla testing around the office.

However, this part raises questions:   As a side note I will likely not have much time for user testing considering how much clients usually pay   Well, how are you practicing UX, exactly? I understand many folks see ""UX"" as a make pretty role, but the real value add for both your clients and what your boss can charge to sell your services is primarily found in the testing and research phase. Getting away from the desk, gaining understanding, and talking to real people past just your stakeholders.  The issue with the folks who create fancy, lickable UI Dribbble shots is, without something like usability testing/analytics/split tests, you may just end up rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.   And again, this kind of skill just adds to your firm's (and your career's) value. It doesn't even have to be overly formal and fancy.

userexperience,389fvi,Spoooooooooooooky,2,Tue Jun 2 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"That is an accurate statement, now allow me to explain why doing that is a bad idea:   The Windows version came out a year after the Mac version. In that time, one would imagine, that they learned a lot from the design and creation of the Mac version. Had the design functioned well they could have reproduced it identically on Windows, but instead they improved upon it. The Mac version arbitrarily separates content into disparate views that remove the context of how those views relate to one another. The key word here is ""disparate"" views. Disparate means ""essentially different in kind; not allowing comparison"". However the content being separated is in fact all the same content, just at different points in it's life cycle (previous commits, unsync'd commits, changes not yet commited). There is a natural and obvious order to them that can be displayed in a clean and simple manner. The Mac version groups things together in a button-group that have nothing to do with each other. How does ""settings"" relate to ""history"" and represent the context of what the group choice is meant to convey? Button-groups are not tabs. They should not be used to representationally convey different views, they are meant to be a choice in a given set of similar items. (Windows|Linux|Mac) makes sense, but (Mac|Settings|Safari) does not, those three items should not be linked as doing so confuses their meaning (does settings apply to the OS or the Browser, or the app that inexplicably put those three things into a group).   The Mac version has objectively bad design. It poorly conveys information and the Windows version was an improvement in every way (until today's release). I honestly had always just assumed that eventually the clunky, confusing Mac version would be brought up to speed to match the the Windows design, followed by an Ubuntu release."
userexperience,389fvi,Spoooooooooooooky,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"Valid points, however I feel that these different versions on different platforms always have problems. Platform A has problems and pluses and Platform B has problems and pluses in the same program. Most of these problems and sollutions arise from following platform specific design guidelines and asymmetrical development timelines. Instead of redesigning two new programs they redesigned one so on whatever platform you are things are both in the same place.  Being able to always find the things you are looking for is more important than perfect UX. For example, People will adjust that summary and description will now be below instead of on top. but having to find it in a whole different place when switching platforms is worse."
userexperience,389fvi,Kenblu24,7,Tue Jun 2 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"Well switching to Windows, previously, would have been very simple, as EVERYTHING was displayed conveniently on one screen. It was in a logical, easy to understand place.  I get that there are established design principles on specific platforms, but if your audience doesn't gain anything from them, toss em. It's like how ""Menu"" is now a hamburger icon on Android, despite the fact that still no one knows what it is, does, or that it can be clicked on.  If abandoning platform specific design patterns makes your app better and easier to use for your users. DO IT!"

In the article you will see examples of all kinds of test.  For example how efficient is your picture upload feature. Lets say you test 10 people and 6 succeed. In simple metrics this means 60% success rate, but when you add the random, things shift.  Using the formula (or the calculator) it shows a range of min 31% to max 83% success rate. This means if minimum of 31% is too small for you or 83% is not enough, you need to adjust the feature and try again.  And, of course, smaller sample size, even with this formula, can lead to deviations in data."

Designers think they should do discovery, coders think THEY should do discovery, architects, ops, goddamn first line support.  No, look, discovery will always be incomplete. This is a simple fact. It is also a fact that communication and adjustment must be two-way - we've known this for ages you can't fully spec up front for anything except the most trivial.  There is nothing wrong with the BA process, indeed of all the people involved in a project the BA is the only one who actually has the job of doing discovery, so let them do their job.  The weaknesses you identify are not an issue with BA discovery, the weaknesses are BAs who aren't great at their job (most aren't same as most other people) and a process that limits communication and revision to a single direction - but that just means the process is stuck in the 90s.  We already know the designers will spot things that need to be adjusted based on their particular vision, the same applies to the coders, the architect, the ops guys the db admin the list goes on, no single person in that group will spot everything.

If you want to write something positive - and you should because you care and you're a good writer - then talk about ways to build that reverse path from the specialists (some of whom will see it for the first time months into the project) and the client. How do you engage the client in that fashion? Who should your BA talk to as a matter of urgency during discovery? What aspects of your processes should BAs who work for/with you be familiar with? Can you write a one-pager that makes those things clear? (For example if you do agile in a particular way, or love personas and like the BA to be able to use compatible language). Checklists and quick evaluation tools can help too.  Remember that a lot of this can be soft process, it doesn't need to be formalized, one of the skills capable senior people bring to the table is knowing who to go have lunch with, and how to generate a welcoming, available, friendly and helpful disposition so that BAs and others involved in the process feel like they can give you a quick call to ask a question when they realize they're not certain.  There's so much to this, there really isn't a simple solution but everything gets easier when you have people who can cross-train a bit so that they start to understand other perspectives."

I worked my ass off to come up with ways to cut costs and increase revenue enough to equate to 15% of the store's revenue. But I get your point.  Coding... I'm really good with the google machine and I'm competent with HTML/CSS. But I wanted it to be clear that I am NOT a developer. It isn't my passion and I have no desire to do anything like that in my day-to-day.  Portfolio... I had it up earlier, but when the shit storm kicked up at work, I got my hand slapped for having client work out there. So I just hid the whole thing as defense mechanism for now.  EDIT: Education  Mercer will let you customize your business degree through their ""MAPS"" program. As long as the dean signs off, you can do pretty much what want to.

I think that would be relevant experience, right?

userexperience,38ag91,V-mafia,2,Tue Jun 2 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts for you:   The lab should be built around what you are testing.  Sure, flexibility is great, but if I was mostly testing smart TVs I'd have a very different set-up than if I worked for fitbit.   Technology has evolved so rapidly that the concept of a formal ""lab"" is a bit out of date.  If I was mostly testing standard desktop and mobile stimuli I'd rather have a ""lab in a bag"" type set up that I could use anywhere (including field studies) rather than have a cumbersome, fixed lab ""system"".  A relatively quiet room is all I need (and even that is not mandatory).  If you are testing a more specialized product (e.g., medical devices) the typical lab in a bag setup might need augmentation, but for most situations you can do all that you need.  Personally I feel the ""high-end"" idea is a bit of a strange concept as you can get 1080 HD video for a fraction of what SD systems would have cost just a few years ago. So often when I use labs at work (or at different companies when I was a consultant) it is a huge pain to figure out what equipment had been changed, what settings other researches changed or reset.  Did they install a new program that threw something out of whack? With a lab in a bag I know exactly what I have and how to troubleshoot it.  It probably costs less to pay for 10 lab in a bag setups than one super fancy lab. The one exception is eye tracking where most systems still tend to be fairly expensive, however the number of projects where you really, really need an eye-tracker are probably few and far between.  I wouldn't include an eye-tracker by default unless there was a compelling reason. I'd encourage you to approach designing a UX lab with the same UCD principles you would for any product.   Figure out what you need to capture/record and work backwards."

If I'm sending a concept to someone over email I'll do it slightly differently than in the middle of a presentation in front of a group of people. It also depends on how much the people on the other end know about the specific project.  Typically its smart to set the context up front for why the project even exists in the first place. From there anything you note about your layout and design should all be things that are working to solve the projects specific goals.  Sorry that's still a bit vague.

It's an online program that is very fast paced, but it teaches you quite a bit of UX principle stuff.  Like many of the other commentors said, education is just the beginning/the background and most people are self taught or use their varied backgrounds to turn into UX practitioners. Once you are able to start building a portfolio and doing things in practice, that's when you start to show your value. The Kent State program helps me to build out some of my portfolio items as well, which is good. I will also say that networking (in school and out in the world) does wonders for actually starting in the industry.  Is it worth it? Depends.

So I began my studies by taking a BSc degree in Psychology. During my final year I didn't have a CLUE what I wanted to do, I knew I didn't want to be a pure psychologist but what else could I be that still utilised Psychology so much? Luckily my Dad worked as a project manager for a company that does a lot of Human Factors. He introduced me to the study of Human Factors, which I then took an an MSc (Human Factors and ergonomics more specifically). Within this I took a lot of modules around HCI and UX. Now its key to note that, at least in the UK, you don't have to have a UX degree of any sort. If I was aware and willing to work for a few months for free I could have delve into the industry with just my Psychology BSc.  Im now coming up to the end of my MSc and over the summer I'm working as a UX consultant, while doing my thesis. So I guess what I'm trying to say is you don't have to study HCI or UX directly, it helps, but subjects such as Psychology, Graphic design, art and media studies will help too. Its all about being able to learn some UX stuff on top, and apply what you've learnt before. I consider myself a Psychologist with some UX training, but thats just me.

Both programs were pretty good, especially the graduate level. DePaul is expensive and the program can take awhile if you don't take several classes at a time, but the school offers some graduate assistantship and teaching assistant positions to help cover cost.  The plus to both Designation and DePaul is the networking aspect. In either case, you'll meet the right people, work with them, and land jobs with them.

I have always thought  that the Metro style of square icons makes it harder to pick things out, and may partly explain why Windows Phone is so far behind Android and iOS.   I think they have tried to differentiate themselves from Mac OS as much as possible, and in doing so made it a little less pleasant to use.   Having said that, this isn't critical like it would be on the web. Text labels make it easy enough to find what you're looking for. The icons also stay in the same place, so finding them will become automatic for the most part. And the OS (for better or worse) encourages more type-to-search, which means icons aren't as important as they used to be.  I'd be surprised if Microsoft haven't done any proper user testing on this. Presumably most people find their way around just fine. But it is a less pleasant OS as a result, and I believe it's going to cause a lot more people to start looking at Mac, Chrome OS and maybe even Android as an alternative."
userexperience,37zzh2,FlaviusMaximus,1 point,Sun May 31 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.   I'm going to try to search online for UX studies on it, as I am really curious. Although I am sure I and others will be able to find the icon targets to click on ""fine""--in the sense that we'd find what we need enough to work--but I'd bet that if you carefully measured it, you'd find a significantly greater latency to hit these targets (cf. Fitt's Law) rather than the old skeumorphic style icons, and you might also (if it could be measured) find greater ""load"" on the minds of users during 8-10 hours of using these screens rather than the old UI. Some of the latency may be offset by the much larger target of the whole tile, though.   But for me, boy do I find it unpleasant to look at. I want essentially the XP aesthetic back!"
userexperience,37zzh2,orwellsocietyguy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:22:38 2015 UTC,"Icon colour and it's positioning comes directly from the design area of UX and it's arguable whether it's a pure design debate - but UX'ers obviously have a lot to offer - as a result your 'taste' comes in to play here. Those that didn't like flat design initially have come around. I personally think it all went too flat initially and is coming back round a little - but again it's a subjective thing rather than a definable metric.   The philosophy of flat design is to reduce visual noise. The new look will have (hopefully) gone through multiple rounds if user testing, so don't forget a lot of this is not done simply because some over zealous design team laid down the law. Interfaces just aren't made like that any more.  First up there's a lot of research to prove that white text on a black background is more effective than white on black when it's 'done properly'. This is a core rule of the new 'metro design' or whatever they're now calling it. There's 2 camps of thought on this but you'll find this worth a scan:  https://www.joedolson.com/2006/08/on-the-readability-of-inverted-color-schemes/  The other thing you have to realise is that Win8 is far more flexible as a layout system. 7 still had icons that were simply bevelled to 'look good' and fit in to the 'glassy' effect of the overall system - but also not move to far from the dreaded vista. That glassy windows logo - just looks like vaseline to me. It doesn't say Microsoft, it says 'ooh shiny marbles'.  Secondly you see a distinct disconnect in the overall icon design of the apps in Win7. Very few design standards were dictated to app designers and you were pretty much free to put what you liked in a 128x128 square - Adobe adopted the more simple logo's for this very reason. Initially it was some bizarrely coloured eye design that were far closer to full blown logo's or miniature Botticelli illustrations in an attempt to be 'quirky' - they realised this wasn't a sustainable method and ditched it. The OS added a little flair to it with some layering effect, but essentially there's a lot of work for the eyeball to do on initial look. To me the win 7 view is ugly, inconsistent and they scale poorly. With the new layout there's a strict, defined standard. I don't have some 'story' to recall with the icon. I know what Dreamweaver is and I just want a hint at where it is to launch it if I must insist on clicking on a launch icon.  Primary apps and more frequently used apps have larger spaces, they have a coloured background. Tasks like settings are tucked away in to a more mobile like styling with no coloured background. As a result they are less distinct, but this is because settings tasks are often used a lot less. It helps build a visual language of 'that lot is over there' something I find other OS's haven't quite nailed as well.  Remember though that the 10 version is vastly more flexible and scalable. It works on far more resolutions and should perform on vastly differing types of screens. Your example compares a specific window at a specific resolution and I'm sure if those screens were rendered on a bunch of devices you'd start being a lot more sympathetic to win10.  OS X has become flatter but has suffered from becoming a semi-seku mishmash of flat and bevelled looks. 10.10 cleaned it up a lot more but there's still things that really irk me about os x. The system prefs panel just seems so reluctant to move forward, the difference between the mobile and desktop is disjointed in these tasks and on an 11inch macbook air I struggle with window layouts all the time.  I also find that apple and google iOS layouts have become very similar. Having crossed iOS apps over to android you find yourself moving menus and accommodating features, but with Windows conversions you start from scratch. Windows 'feels' very distinct. You know it's window just by looking at it, but I've been caught out by iOs and Android several times (possibly because I work with them more).  I like Windows for the first time in 8. I always hated the old windows style, it's dragged behind for the best part of 10 years and whilst you may not 'like it' I personally think it's innovative and helps push forward touch surfaces. I never got that from the older versions."
userexperience,37zzh2,Spoooooooooooooky,2,Mon Jun 1 11:31:58 2015 UTC,I think Microsoft decided to make different design patterns important compared to Mac.  They went with the idea that the more important a app is the bigger it should be. Also the idea that you know what's behind a icon like the photos app showing pictures is a very good ux pattern.  What's lacking with Microsoft is visual design cohesion. It's just a bit of a mess. To many different styles and sizes. Two sizes and just the colors or while text like the weather app would be much better.

User testing will validate the changes you're proposing AND give you some concrete qualitative and quantitative data to show your stakeholders to justify your design.   If you can walk through your design options with a few real users, you'll have a more concrete path to completion. It shouldn't be hard to test against grouping the form fields in different ways, but you may have to set up some prototypes to test the more complex UIs. If you want to be even more thorough, consider walking through the current design with some users and asking a few questions along the way (a contextual interview) to get a basis for improvement.   When you've got some clarity (e.g. ""Users responded well to prototype B and spent 25% less time. Conversion rate went up, etc""), consider A/B testing as well. In this scenario, you would present two different UI components (or different forms altogether) to real users in production. If you form a testable hypothesis, you can then watch to see what version performs better.   It doesn't have to be extensive research to draw some conclusions. Even starting with a few questions like ""why didn't you complete the form?"" or ""how can this be better?""  can lead to great results. Good luck! PM me for more depth, if you'd like."
userexperience,37kxyq,barrypickles,0,Fri May 29 00:39:16 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. Nice comment.
userexperience,37kxyq,Sudaka,7,Thu May 28 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I know you probably don't want to hear this, but...   potentially hundreds of fields and making it more usable   ...the first and more important thing you need to do is to work with the stakeholders to minimize the number of fields. Usability isn't a stand-alone property you can attach to anything. If something is inherently unusable (as this form seems to be), anything you do in terms of interaction and visual design will only scratch the surface. Maybe an online form isn't the best solution here; maybe you can ask for basic data now, and then ask for additional data as needed in the future; maybe there are too many ""just in case"" questions...  If I were you, I'll invest all my time and effort in trying to explain why this is a problem to whoever has the power to change it, and work with them through different solution ideas.  If that's impossible (I truly believe that's never the case, but I don't know your particular situation) or if you cut down the number of questions and they are still a lot, I would suggest you to employ the following techniques to try to lessen the pain for the users:   Before users starts completing the form, give them a clear indication about how long it will be, what kind of information will be required and how long will it take. Use progressive disclosure wherever you can. For example, show dependent questions only after the main ones have been completed. Hide everything that isn't needed. For example, if you ask a given set of questions only during december, hide them from january until november. Auto-save their progress frequently and let them know you're doing it. You don't want users losing all their work because of a power outage or something like that. Give users a strong sense of achievement during the process. Congratulate and thank them when they complete a section, and specially when they finish. Save them time and inputs wherever you can by using flexible fields (the ""phone"" one is a good example), deducing data from previous inputs and (I insist) removing unneeded fields.   Good luck!"

Yeah, this has been a secondary goal of mine that I've been trying to figure out how to broach this.  For some context, I'm being contracted to create a very detailed and verbose report-writing software. I'm looking at what you said about reducing the number of fields and wondering how I can best approach them and say: ""This is going to overload your users, let's find a way to say what the users actually need"".  Thank you so, so much for that huge writeup! It's really helping me a lot."

userexperience,37m7yc,wombatjuggernaut,3,Thu May 28 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"My advice - don't worry about being intrusive for 5% of your users. What's worse is not being clear enough with 95% of your users, and then dealing with bad customer reviews, RMAs, and all kinds of nastiness from the much larger (and potentially more mistake-prone) user-base.  Think about that: avoiding being intrusive for just 5% of your users makes it EXPONENTIALLY worse for you.   More users in total placing orders for the standard widget Users who are more prone to making mistakes Greater consequences for you if something goes wrong   Look at RedBox - it makes you EXPLICITLY acknowledge that you've added the Bluray version of the movie to your cart, and many more than 5% of its customers have Bluray players.  I would force the user to acknowledge they've selected the special variant, and I would even add ""(UNCOMMON)"" to the title."
userexperience,37m7yc,phpdevster,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"Great insight. It's tough to get out of the frame of mind of ""it's inherently bad to throw an extra pop-up at these users when they legitimately want this item"", but I think you make a great point.   If they're a very small part of the user base, and the extra hurdle isn't that bad, but saves a bunch of pain from the larger part of the user base, it can definitely be worth it.  Thanks!"
userexperience,37m7yc,punctuation-marks,3,Thu May 28 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a pop-up or modal with a ""Don't remind me again"" option to keep from nagging the 5% for later purchases? This could be an account flag or a cookie set that would disable the pop-up for any visits in the future.  If they're a very small percentage of users, maybe not worth the hassle, but I always appreciate steps that allow me to skip the reminders."

I repeat, subtle."

userexperience,37ibm1,GfK_en,2,Mon Jun 1 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a contrary opinion but if this is a discussion then I at least want to put it forward.  I believe that anyone can and should be able to define whatever behaviours they like on their site, page, webapp, whatever. If that means they modify the way scrolling behaves, so be it. You don't have to like it, appreciate it, implement it, or interact with it.  This does not mean that you shouldn't have an opinion on it - actually the complete opposite. You should, as you have done here, vocalise how you feel about it and engage in a discussion, because like anything in this world - there are very different points of view. Sometimes a break from the norm and what is expect is so jarring that it just feels wrong - but that doesn't necessarily make it wrong. The web is not ""done"". The way we interact with it is going to change over time as new hardware and software become available, as new ideas spring forward. Ideas like how scrolling behaves.  I'm not even saying that I like this kind of scrolling! I'm generally pretty neutral about it, but I do feel that as pages get less and less linear, the scroll system that is in place, the system designed for completely linear pages, should change to accomodate that. Change is a good thing - the web is now this rich, dynamic, complex environment, where as I can remember a time when it was completely static, save for horrible ""under construction"" gifs littered all over the place. I know people who remember a time where the ""web"" consisted of ascii characters on a terminal screen. We are not at the finish line - of course be critical of change, but welcome it, otherwise you might be throwing out cars for carts."

I would say I agree with you, but, I think there can be a right and wrong answer if you're setting an end goal.  If a person wants their website to generate as many sales leads as possible, and the designer has implemented this kind of ""scroll jacking"", then I'd bet you'll get a higher drop off rate as users become confused and frustrated.  Although I can't say for sure without testing!  But yes, I agree change can be good.   But I still think there's a reason we don't control our cars with handlebars."
userexperience,37jn74,rkx0328,4,Thu May 28 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have been an experience designer for almost a decade and have hired many, many entry level designers. I just took a quick look at your site. 1) My main feedback is to you need to tell me who you and what you want to be doing. No bullshit. Then you need to tell me why you can do the job I need done. The default state of your portfolio site is all over the place. Industrial Engineer, UX/UI Designer - well, which is it? Those are three different things. 2) Get rid of the auto-advancing carousel. Then never use one again ever. Ever. You have to know your audience here. 3) This site makes me think you are an app designer. Is that right? If not, you need to show me what you want to me doing. 4) The detail in your pieces is great! The constant process is nice and you are providing more detail that most applicants. 5) From your post it sounds like you really need to figure out what part of experience design interests you. There are many areas you can specialize in, but that makes it harder to get a job. By nature, good UX designers are empathetic and interested in other's emotional well-being. If you consider yourself an introvert, it is going to be more difficult for you to constantly want user input and validation of your designs.  6) You should also be looking for internship-level jobs at this stage. The experience working with other UX designers will be invaluable to see what part of this job you like the most. The HCI program would help automate the internship process, you would get more experience and have a little bit of a network - all which will help you in the long run. 7) Keep going, the beauty of this job is you can do it from anywhere and there are no shortage of jobs. They might not be right where you are.    Good Luck  PS. Where is your resume? I found it, but I don't think most will. If you want them to call/email, you have to make it as easy as possible."

I think I'm on the right track of presenting a better portfolio (with a more prominent button for resume); please stay tuned.  As for the ""introverted"" statement, what I really meant was I am not good at ""initiating"" a network; it's a challenge for me to find a job by actively networking and talking to people -- and yet it seems to be one of the best ways to get an entry-level job. I brought that up because my friend was suggesting me to network more on top of submitting resumes and portfolios.   If given the right conditions (i.e. client interview for a project) then it's no problem for me to talk to people. I consider myself to be a great listener and I want to solve people's problems by presenting good design solutions. I love sketching with ideas.

Remember UX design is like a story. How were you involved from the start all the way up to implemention? Designing wireframes is only part of the puzzle. Working with stakeholders / users to design something they really need is key, and it's important you can demonstrate this."

userexperience,3794w3,whys_wise,1 point,Tue May 26 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Intro/About Me  I also finished a summer internship last summer (UX Researcher) and I'll throw in a few. Some may even contradict each other but hey, good thing cognitive dissonance exists. I just graduated with a MS in HCI and I'm currently interviewing at companies.   Be data driven. Stakeholders CAN be difficult to persuade without it. Test even the things that may seem obvious to you at first to gain some credibility. Also, you should probably test your assumptions anyways. Take this with a grain of salt, but this is what I learned from my internship. Assume less. I started with ""Assume nothing"" and it was how I was taught but I take things very literally. Assume stuff but know what assumptions you're making. It's your job not only to know survey biases/cognitive biases but to really internalize them. You should know what biases shape people's behaviors AND your own analysis. Don't depend so much on data - depend on stories. Okay, this is slightly contradicting the first one. However, it's important that you can make the distinction. Data, whether it be quantitative or qualitative can trick you. You can become dependent on it or rely on it too much to see what's in front of you. I'm sure every Statistics professor did ye old ""Look at this data shown in linear vs. log, this is what scientists do to make data look more significant"". While debatable, numbers can trick you. Oh, so can people's words Don't be so focused on not fucking up. I'm not saying be reckless here but you should take this with an adventurous spirit. Be careful in your designs/research but if you come out of the experience without having made even one mistake, you're either a UX god or you weren't pushing yourself. Find a mentor. There's a reason everyone says this and it's helped me tremendously in my life. I'm sure you've already read this somewhere in life so I won't bore you. Lastly, you're doing both Design/Research (something I did also). Figure out which one you want to do by the end of the internship. You should have a pretty good idea. For the most part, many companies don't hire for a generalist. Don't get me wrong, UX Designers will be doing research and sometimes vice versa but you should know what you want to do after graduating.    You should check out /r/uxresearch if you ever have any UXR related questions or want to browse more stuff. It's definitely a smaller group but most stuff is about UXR."
userexperience,375nct,RAWRREPTAR,2,Mon May 25 02:20:35 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify what you mean by co-design and behavior maps and what kind of data you would get from each? Maybe provide an example?  If you can break the data down into individual notes/data points, there are tons of different models out there for organizing it and representing it. The affinity diagram is ""hyped"" because, when done right, it's extremely powerful and flexible and flows pretty seamlessly into design ideation. It can also serve as the base for other representations such as personas and journey maps.  When you can't really break things down into individual notes it becomes a bit more challenging. The classic Contextual Design includes instructions on how to build an artifact model of some sort, but I can't recall what's involved."
userexperience,3731kb,chowfong,4,Sun May 24 12:02:49 2015 UTC,"UX is a diverse field encompassing many specialities. If you're interested in the visual side of UX, graphic design could totally work (although you might find yourself doing a lot of print work – depending on how you feel about that, that could engender a distaste similar to your current situation). You could also look into psychology, communications, or human factors (often found in industrial engineering departments). I would definitely keep that CS minor if you're planning to work with software.  Ultimately, the quality of your work and design process are going to be what helps you in starting your career. Try to work internships and on personal projects for your portfolio."

I would recommend majoring in computer science if at all possible because it has the best earning potential. A graphic design degree will pay considerably less starting out and a psychology degree will require a MA/MS to get a job. I have an MA in Experimental Psychology and work as a UX Researcher.   If you have any friends that have work experience as developers you should talk to them about how much of the math they learned in school is actually used on the job. It will vary depending on what they're working on, but I think it would surprise you how little they actually use.  A MA/MS in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) might be the best bet. However, you will really benefit from just working in the field. I'm traveling today but if you have any questions PM me and I'll get back to you."
userexperience,3731kb,Electrocapsule,0,Sun May 24 13:27:00 2015 UTC,"Hi i'm looking into UX design too because i'm majoring in psychology with a minor in graphic design. I took intro to computer science (python) because I was curious and thought it would help, but I definitely don't know enough to do work with it. I'm looking into a masters but I want to work first to see if I am actually passionate about psychology. I've been working in a lab for a year regarding perception, so we use high functioning eye tracking devices, and I already know this is something I can't do for the rest of my life.  Since you're in a similar position (psych degree and have a job in UX), how much math do you use? I always got good grades in statistics but always forget the small stuff when I actually need to use it. Also as a UX researcher how much design do you use? What does a UX portfolio even look like?"
userexperience,3731kb,Booty_Poppin,2,Sun May 24 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"The only math I really use are non-parametric statistics like confidence intervals (I rarely have the sample size to do anything else). I use RITE methodology to discover problems, not write statistically significant papers. I work in a B2B application environment and it is difficult to test with our users (Our users time is valuable, their skills are specialized, etc.), and I can rarely get large sample sizes. I would recommend the book Quantifying the User Experience if you're interested in working with small sample sizes as a UX Researcher.   Personally, I've done a bit of design work and typically create guidance documentation for my team. Design principles are important, but the cognitive/perceptual aspects of psychology will really help you to make the best decisions.   As for my portfolio, I've got a few witeframes in it, but it's predominantly test plan/results/analysis.   I can answer any other questions you have."

userexperience,372gd0,harroo182,7,Sun May 24 06:11:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, you need to figure out if a UX designer will actually offers enough value to your clients that they are willing to pay for it.   Right now, you're assuming that to be true, but if you question that assumption, and validate it, then you can start to make the argument to your boss. Many designers just want things to be better, but you need to quantify better for your boss and your clients. Is paying more for UX valuable enough to spend less on marketing, or SEO, or staff bonuses etc...?  It's worth noting that many small projects don't need a dedicated UX person, and just having a designer or PM play that role could be enough, but they may just need a bit more training.  My suggestion, find a good UX freelancer, get their rates. Ask your boss to sell it as an optional extra on selected projects with a mark up and see what happens. A key argument is that projects with UX may be able to command a higher margin, which your boss may be interested in.   However, that all depends on his business model. The McDonalds/Ryanair/Wallmart's of the world make a lot of money by offering cheap & cheerful products. Not everything needs to be high end."

Second a ""workflow"" issue: I regularly go to comments first to determine what kind of article and if it's worth at all reading. I avoid a lot of spam that way.  Essentially, IMO, the article should be shown on its own terms and reddit should be focused on reddit.

It really does depend on how the user uses the site. Reddit, as it is, serves its function well, but I agree with others here that would prefer if content outside reddit.com opened in a new tab.  I'm not a fan of embedded content within another page for stylistic reasons... I feel it clutters the page up and makes it confusing; I'm not sure where I am, what I'm supposed to be interacting with, who is responsible for the content I'm seeing at any given place on the page (unless branding is VERY good on both parts). If it's in a frame or a scrolling div or something, I don't like that my scroll wheel ends up scrolling two different things, and doesn't scroll what I expect it to."

Too many sites whose target audience, or at least a big portion of viewers is late middle age and above have the shittiest designs because it's made and seen by an audience that doesn't really know better.   Sure, not all sites need advice from an elderly woman, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a lot that would greatly benefit from it. And even if your site doesn't exactly target an older audience, it never hurts to get opinions from your secondary or tertiary audience if for just a new take on it all. It's not like they take your $75 and buy a gun with it that they hold to your head while forcing you to implement her ideas. Also, it's only $75.

userexperience,36qn0f,BuizelBros,2,Thu May 21 10:19:53 2015 UTC,"Start registering with recruitment agencies. Most of them will only be really interested in you once you have quit your perm job, as you need to be available immediately for most contracts, no 4 week notice waiting period. Therefore you should have money saved up to cover you while you wait for your first contract to come in. I guess the standard advice would be to save up at least 3 months living expenses but it really depends how much you live life flying by the seat of your pants I guess. It's never taken me 3 months to find a contract (London) but YMMV.   Get your portfolio looking great while you save up money and start browsing job boards to get an idea of the market in your area.   Make it clear to recruiters that you are now only interested in contract roles. They will still send you permanent roles anyway!  In terms of taxes etc, you will need use an umbrella company or set up your own Ltd company and become self employed. The umbrella option is easier but obviously the umbrella company takes a (large) cut of everything you earn. If you set up a Ltd company, you will probably want an accountant. I'd recommend www.crunch.co.uk and if you use my referral code amy1gag6j1 then you get £25 in amazon vouchers and I get £50. Don't feel obliged though obviously!   You'll also need to set up a business bank account which can take a while so get moving on that asap. You need to register your company first though, which Crunch can help with.  www.yunojuno.com is a pretty good platform to bypass recruiters and in general it is pretty user friendly. Although it drives me mad on a daily basis that you can only select one discipline to see jobs in - I actually have two accounts now, one for Design and one for UX, because they have deemed them totally separate and you cannot look at both types of role from one account.

I was able to apply the principles very quickly to my actual day-job, and to some personal projects for my portfolio. I feel that helped considerably in me getting a new job where I was able to apply the skills I had learned (for more money! hurray!).

userexperience,36lvgj,rdsubhas,13,Wed May 20 10:08:36 2015 UTC,"""This must be done.""  These are not the words that a highly-professional UX person should ever use.   First, there's always alternatives. Except in matters of life and death (which I'm guessing the tooltip placement is not), there are multiple ways to accomplish the same goal.  Second, a professional co-worker would ask, not demand. it's just courtesy. Unless they are your manager and monitoring all of your tasks, they have no idea what other things you've got in the work queue.  Third, great UX people savor the constraints of the systems they design in. ""The Medium of Design is Behavior,"" as Robert Fabricant tells us. You use the constraints of the system to get the behaviors you want.  Sturgeon's Law tells us that 90% of everything is crap. UX people are not immune from this law, so, unfortunately, you've likely been working with one of the 90%. Hopefully, you'll have a chance to work with one of the thousands who are in the 10% and see that this isn't about conversing with UX people in general as much as it's about conversing with this particular UX person.  Hope that helps,  Jared"

userexperience,36lvgj,jakerogz,6,Fri May 22 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"It is totally fine for a UX designer to demand whatever they want, however, it is always up to engineering to determine the level of effort and offer alternatives that could be similar and faster than the original implement.   The alternatives can be solutions that the platform already supports or a slightly different UX experience. Give concrete time estimates for the original design and for all your alternatives explaining why one is faster than another. Just saying it will take a long time is helpful to no one.   Of course, they can tell you to do it the more difficult way and you shouldn't fight that. If they really want the more expensive solution then determine if this new UX will be used often. If it will be, then try to engineer a solution that will make it easy to use in the future thus saving future projects time and effort.   The key to any job that separates design and engineering (which is a good thing) is communication, context of how your current project fits in, and respect between the parties involved.   If the UX person refuses to consider your well defined alternatives then you have a personnel issue not an engineering one."
userexperience,36lvgj,Slruh,6,Wed May 20 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"Any UX Designer worth their wireframes should understand that everything is based on sacrifices and trade-offs.  On the other hand, I have to say that the way you're saying things sounds a bit rigid... a dev telling the UX guy ""it would take lots of unnecessary effort"" just comes off as petulant.  You should be working with them and the product owner and engineering manager to determine where resources should be spent to achieve the greatest value.  A dev suggesting that they know that an effort is 'unnecessary' is absurd.   Likewise, a UX designer who doesn't present designs with data and justification through iterations of designs and user tests makes it hard for them to present the rationale and value for their designs.    So basically what you're saying sounds like an internal process problem.  UX Designer presents designs and value assessment to Product Owner who grooms the backlog and assigns tasks to the Developers.  Ideally you're all working together to weigh the trade-offs rather than sniping at each other."
userexperience,36lvgj,oddible,6,Wed May 20 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're in a tough situation. I'm a UX designer who grew into that role after working as an old school web designer for a number of years (i.e. I designed and then coded my own work), so here are some thoughts on this situation based on my personal experience.  Both designers and developers benefit from knowing their constraints – the functional and performance limits of a system, the data that's available, how locked in part of the codebase may be or however it can be extended, time/money/people, etc. They also benefit from being creative and coming up with alternative solutions to workaround what may initially be perceived as a show-stopper.  Take for example the placeholder problem you mentioned. Sure, for total cross-browser compatibility you may need to tack on some JS, but for support in the majority of contemporary browsers you could just use the placeholder=""foo"" HTML attribute. There, nice and simple. UX will probably appreciate the solution, even if it's a compromise and hopefully you'll appreciate being able to make your system better without being mired in a ton of new JS dependencies.  As far as the limits of a current system, I wonder how themeable or extensible it is. I've worked on some pretty locked down CMSs in my day but they often allowed for at least custom CSS and/or JS to be included as well. That may not have the capability to dramatically change underlying functionality, but a bit of CSS can change the layout of a confusing form that's being spit out and a bit of JS (like jQuery) could easily manipulate the DOM to reorder a few front-end elements.  My biggest suggestion to you is try to work with UX on solving these challenges together. Meet with them face to face and talk through some known constraints, then talk about what's really good enough and get creative about how you can accomplish them in a simple manner. Try to understand that they're advocating for the users of your product, so yes, they may want to change something that's confusing, frustrating or cumbersome to those users currently, even if ""it works"" already (it may not work well).  A shared understanding of priorities and constraints will get you to a good place with your coworkers. Try to improve that and I think you'll find your UX peers become great collaborators and will be part of you making some pretty cool stuff.  PS. If the UX team conducts usability tests, you should join in on one! Seeing first-hand (and talking about) how troublesome something can be to a regular layperson end-user can be a real eye opener as to why UX may be pushing hard for a particular request and why they're asking you to invest a significant amount of effort into X, Y or Z."
userexperience,36lvgj,sojustcloud,3,Wed May 20 11:26:29 2015 UTC,"I think you should be more accommodating. These people sound unreasonable because they don't understand the limitations of technology. It is your job to tell them clearly what can and cannot be done and be strong about it.  That being said, I am recently working with a designer who does not know how the web works but her designs are beautiful as fuck. My first reaction when I see every design is how the hell am I going to make that shit work! But, if you challenge yourself and try to implement it, you learn a whole lot more as well as producing beautiful pieces.   Timing issue, you have to make them understand why it takes more time. But I feel like your perspective of them all being ignorant idiots needs a little adjustment. I'm not condescending. I was you sometime back but there's so much more fun in collaboration and wanting the same end goal.   Hope this helps!"

userexperience,36lvgj,bethevoid,2,Wed May 20 19:06:51 2015 UTC,Who makes the decisions? Is there a product owner who you can both explain your concerns to and let them make the final decision?
userexperience,36lvgj,Pete-the-meat,2,Wed May 20 16:03:12 2015 UTC,"I would say this is largely a communication/personality issue, less than it is a dev working with ux issue. I do have a suggestion for something to keep in mind though... When you respond to a design with resistance based on how long it will take to build, try to remember that they've already put the time into building it on their end. Using time as push back can be frustrating for a designer because they've already spent quite a bit of time building what they've found to be the best solution – this is time that you might not be directly aware of. It can seem disrespectful to the time they've put in, and the future time they'll then have to put in to finding a different solution that will work better within the system.  But back to the communication bit... If you want the ux person to understand the system better, help explain it. If you want to understand the design decisions better, ask for them to explain in full. If they don't have a reason for their designs that has something to do with what's best for the user, than this person might just suck at their job.   If anyone talked to me like that from any position I'd be irritated. So try not to generalize this to be directly about ux people :)"
userexperience,36lvgj,cacawcacaw,2,Thu May 21 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, your UX designers really lack a solid understanding of the technologies they're designing for.  This, coupled with what sounds like a bit of a superiority complex, makes for a ""diva designer"".  They're right to insist on something that they think is the best UX.  They're not right to use phrases like ""I'm the UX here, not you"" unless you're actually pushing for a change in the UX.  However, that's not how you've positioned yourself in these conversations: your concerns are about implementation requirements and level of effort, rather than what the ""best UX"" is.  I'd recommend you stop pushing back on reasons why something can't be done/is difficult and instead focus on being more agreeable: ""Sure, we can move these two fields to the top.  However, please bear in mind that, in order to accomplish this, we'll need to use CSS to force them into this position, and we don't have any control over what content the users will or won't place in the same spot.  This is the nature of the CMS we're using.""  Etc.  As has already been mentioned in this thread, the UX designer is welcome to ask for anything and, frankly, almost anything can be done on any platform, given adequate time and resources.  That said, the UX designer cannot dictate the level of effort involved unless they have as intimate knowledge of the underlying technologies as you do.  More on that shortly.  In the interim, however, this situation potentially leads to another problem you've already mentioned:   They sometimes don't understand the system they're dealing with - Android/ Browser/ CMS/ HTML5/ etc.   You can do very little about this, other than to let them know that you believe it would be in their best interest to learn more about this system as they are currently designing against it, which will in turn lead to a poorer user experience.  Regarding legitimate UX pushback on implementation: I speak from something of a hybrid position. I've been designing since roughly 1989, and hand-coding since the early 1990s.  Thus, I have a pretty solid understanding of both design and implementation.  This puts me in something of a unique position on most teams in that I not only know what makes for a good design as well as how to best implement it.  This, in turn, means I'm able to articulate how to best implement something if I feel I am hearing too much pushback from dev teams, i.e. ""It'll take weeks"" when I know it's just a lack of understanding of CSS (or whatever) that's causing a dev to make such claims.  There is such a thing as an uninformed dev, too.  Make sure you're really speaking from a position of knowledge/experience-based authority, and that when you say something will take days or weeks to implement, that this is truly accurate.  If a UX designer is able to poke holes in your timelines, this is going to impact your authority in this matter.  None of this is intended to imply that you should be taking an adverse position to your UX designers.  You should of course all be working together as closely as possible to achieve success.  That said, it is sometimes true that some individuals will simply be unwilling to grow beyond their comfort zone, and you'll be stuck in the unenviable position of having your development authority challenged simply because they think something ""should be"", rather than whether or not it truly is.  If this is the case, you're just going to have to grin and bear it.  Don't take up a position of adversity; refer back to my earlier recommendation: everything is possible, but each task will have a cost (i.e. the LoE), and you're happy to discuss the technical requirements with them if they would like."

In this, I'm leaving open the possibility that the developer might know a better way to do it and I'll learn something.  If I hear, ""that will take a lot of time"", my first thought is, ""and that's what you're getting paid for"".  Where I would respond positively is, ""I can do that, but it due to the constraint of the browser, it will add about four hours to the project.  Is that acceptable?  I could do xyz and it wouldn't add more than an hour.""  UX designers have the same project manager as you.  They don't want to be the one to tell the customer it will cost more than initially thought because they want a cool feature that really isn't justified.  If you truly have an impossible personality putting excess demands on the programmers, bring it to your boss's attention. If you have doubts, feel free to ask why this particular item is so crucial to the project.  You may find it was directly requested by the customer.  You may find the designer is an egotistical asshat.  You may find this was simply the best solution they could find for a problem presented to them.

I haven't done much lab work (in comparison to the amount of other roles I've had). I don't like doing it and I'm not keen on using it for many things. So I'm upfront about that.   I always ask - do you do your own research in house? If they say 'yes' or 'were looking to' then I'll go in to that then work across to skill sets from reviews, gap, IA, prototyping and lab testing (which is normally outsourced in my experience).   It's good to mention your outputs of each part of the process."
userexperience,36ffua,Oaklandia,3,Tue May 19 11:11:21 2015 UTC,"Lots of variables.  As an over-simplified overview:   Different places see research differently.  There is a big difference if you are going to be primarily be in a usability/evaluation role or a strategic partner.  You will be able to tell from the questions they ask.  Agency/consultant roles will be different from in-house ones.  For the former they will want to know about your versatility and for the latter, examples of how you can work with a product through all phases of product development.  Seniority matters too.  For more experienced roles you will get more questions about managing other researchers and even more importantly dealing with stakeholders.    Personally I think methods questions can be a bit silly, but people really do seem to like asking them.  Some places will have you do a mock or mini research project or proposal.  I had one interviewer basically say ""you are a researcher, so I want you to ask all the questions for the interview"".  I wasn't expecting that, but it was an interesting approach."
userexperience,36ffua,80b,1 point,Tue May 19 06:24:49 2015 UTC,"I would expect questions about past research you've done: what you did and what tradeoffs you made.... what you learned, what you may have done differently, etc.  Similarly how do you convey your results, and this can vary a lot between qualitative and quantitative.  Since UX research and design aren't separate from each other, you may get some questions to assess good/bad design...   I always pay close attention to their awareness of different types of bias in the design of their research or population sampling. More generally, an awareness of the limitations of past research. It may be an explicit question or questions that provide an opportunity to speak towards it."

Especially when you have to pass work from person to person when another UXA comes to a project.   Omni is pretty unforgiving when it comes to trying to reverse-engineer someone else's work ( Axure is also a nightmare, this way ) but Omni goes that extra mile of evil and will let you delete items in a Master and not indicate where else this action has effect, and does not support reversal in such cases very well at all.

That doesn't invalidate the participation of veryone else, because such workshops exists for at least two main reasons:   To generate as many ideas as possible, from different perspectives and backgrounds. To come up with a solution that has a broader support in the organization.   Beware of this: Co-creation isn't the same as design by consensus.

On Yelp I have found the ratings to be pretty much useless as everyone has different tastes and it's impossible to tell why the person rated the establishment in the way that they did.

Maybe you can talk about the benefits. How them, as developers, can leverage UX to work less, but better, to have more focused tasks or to always know what to improve whatever tool they are working on.   I found that UX is a philosophy you can even apply to your daily life, maybe this kind of universal concepts can create an environment to show them how to easily adopt UX as their guiding principle at work, instead of just imposing a new set of tasks or checkboxes to fill before deploying.  I might be talking out of my ass here, because I don't really know your audience.

When discussing screen reader users specifically, the number only increases to 2.4%. So even users who accessibility advocates used to strut around saying ""you should never use JS, think of poor blind Billy here who has it turned off!"" in 2007 don't really have that argument to fall back on anymore.

userexperience,35sw9p,John_Dope90,1 point,Thu May 14 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"The .design domain here is kinda catchy for a business card, in design circles, for other peeps in the design crowd. But successful normal-human-consumer-facing commerce domains that people need to remember off the top of their head are still almost exclusively .com or .net.   Optimistic souls with the entrepreneurial spirit try the emergent domains but rarely to any success - most people consumers just remember something on the web ends with "".com"" or occasionally "".net"".   Two main reasons you might invest in a .design domain now would be as a hedge against the status quo; maybe these domains will catch on ( or "".com/.net"" will become irrelevant ) at some point, or as a defensive measure against your competitor or some malcontent getting it and somehow abusing your brand with a name that's very similar."
userexperience,35sw9p,NightGatherz,1 point,Thu May 14 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you that was very insightful. Honestly was considering it until I found out there are so many extensions already. Found possibly better options but I also am very hesitant. Besides looking sexy on a business card will these ever really be practical in next 10 or 20 years?  Does it strengthen google rank at least? ex. say I have ecommerce plumbing.supply and someone searches ""plumbing supply"" and then ""plumbing supplies"" does it affect rank of either and would it be substantial?"
userexperience,35sw9p,John_Dope90,2,Wed May 20 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a long time out of that skillset - I did time in an SEO shop about 12 years ago - but from I've gleaned since then it will either have no effect on page rank, or it will weaken it. When the new domains come out there's always a rush with spammers buying up what they consider to be valuable domains, and a lot of crap comes from them ( remember .mobi? ). It's my understanding that this behavior winds up causing Google to give pages in these domains a page rank hit.   I wonder if in the future, where you're just clicking on links and saving them like we do phone numbers, the strings we use as domain names will be less important, just like phone numbers are now. Back in the Day, having a phone number that went with some catchy mnemonic was the bomb. Now who knows or remembers any phone numbers at all? We don't use them in that way.  Kind of like the phrase ""the bomb.""   ;  )"
userexperience,35sw9p,NightGatherz,1 point,Wed May 20 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, domains could be for majority obsolete in 10 years who knows. everyone just uses search engines or referral sites if its short and sweet so that it makes it easier to recall it could be better for WOM but most of these options would probably just make it generic and harder to remember especially since everyone is prone to think .COM"

I used to use it on RoosterTeeth Podcasts awhile back I know that for certain, I always just thought it had been there since like 2011.  I'm not entirely sure if it was a fully fledged feature back then however it may just of been a thing that the content creator chose to turn on or off, but I've never been a content creator so for that I have no idea."

You got thumbs to keep track as well. What is shitty about this?

userexperience,35rkoy,ambyance,2,Tue May 12 22:42:10 2015 UTC,"What is your background/education and what do you want to achieve? That would be interesting to know to make better suggestions.  I have not taken this course but I would guess that you can get your education cheaper with MOOCs, books and other resources on the web. That requires you to be disciplined though and work through your material. In the end what people were interested in when hiring me was that I have a masters degree (no questions about grades or anything), my skills and what is in my portfolio. The degree is not always necessary.  The most important thing is that you try out and refine your process in projects. Document everything and put the best stuff in a portfolio.  If you want to get some certificates you could have a look at interaction-design.org. They are not that expensive and you can take plenty of courses for free if you are a member. The course quality is not great but ok.  You can also take small courses from Skillshare for example to learn a bit about tools like Illustrator and so on."
userexperience,35rkoy,P4x,0,Wed May 13 14:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed response! Unfortunately, I don't have any background in UX or CS, so I was looking into some courses. Of the free MOOC's I've tried which aren't a lot, codecademy is nice.   I'll check out the links you provided for sure. I tend to favor structured courses/classes since I might not be very disciplined when it comes to MOOCs but hopefully it works out!"
userexperience,35rkoy,P4x,2,Wed May 13 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I totally understand that online courses are difficult to keep up because the pressure is rather low. I thought the course you linked is completely online as well.  If you actually have group projects and so on this might be worth it. That makes it much easier because you have some pressure with deadlines which keeps you going and you work in a team. Team work in design is a very good lesson. You can learn to discuss designs, distribute work bases on skills and give each other feedback while not taking it personal. It's also great for building a network in that field.  I found another course about HCI on Coursera. Solid syllabus and it's free.   If you don't have any background in CS/UX, you should consider if you interested in learning web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This always come in handy as a ""UX person"" and can only make you more employable. However, some people don't like the technical aspect which is totally fine.  Also the sidebar has some good resources in it.  Whatever you do, remember this: If you want to get good at UX you should practice it. Work on projects and do stuff. I would guess that most courses will include some assignments. Do them and take it serious. Try to do a good job and learn whatever it takes on the side. Need a prototype? Draw paper prototypes or learn some basic html and javascript. Need icons for the project? Spend some time in Illustrator to create them yourself. Need Wireframes? Maybe use/learn a software like Axure. It doesn't need to be perfect but you will get much more out of the education than if you do the bare minimum and just try to get that certificate/degree."
userexperience,35qrgr,robo_cobb,2,Tue May 12 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"I also like the proposal, but I'm wondering if anyone else here would find a distinction between ""wireframes"" and ""sketches"" useful? By sketches I mean something with simple or no annotations, not click-thru, just done on-the-fly to get quick consensus like ""okay, this is what we're all talking about, now we'll get to wiring it up.""  For a long time my workflow has included this step, and while I could use Axure or something as robust, for a couple reasons something simpler like Balsamiq suits much better.   I'm not trying to make the diagram more complicated than it needs to be, I'm just wondering if this process is widespread and maybe we need another circle here, or not."
userexperience,35qrgr,NightGatherz,2,Fri May 15 17:54:24 2015 UTC,I know a group of designers in the NYC / SF area and all of us are big proponents of sketching out ideas on paper or white-board.

userexperience,35oqpa,DarkHaute,1 point,Tue May 12 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, excellent! Do you feel the course has given you a solid grounding, then? You sound confident enough about it.  I've got a non-UX portfolio which I can adapt, but I do need to get on to doing some UX stuff. I think what's putting me off diving in head-first is the UI aspect. I'm seeing a lot of emphasis on roles where UI seems to be significant - it's just not my area of strength, though. I don't know whether or not it's just a UK thing."
userexperience,35oqpa,Jelly_Jim,1 point,Tue May 12 22:04:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's everyone man. Companies are still new to UX so a lot of job descriptions for UX Designer will say, ""Abode Creative Suite skills"" or ""Proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop"".   I'm in the DC market... I think it's a problem all over. The GA course is not just the course. If i spoke for the course itself, I'd say it's ok. You could do most of the work on your own, but it gives you structure and environment to grow in and people that want to achieve the same degree of work. It pushes you.   It's $4,000, 12-weeks, two-days a week, 2 hours each day. It's not worth $4,000. (it's the part-time course not immersive) but the people you meet and the opportunities there after.. is priceless.

userexperience,35q5cp,twelvedollarlabcoat,2,Tue May 12 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"Why not just create two websites? One for ServiceEase and one for yourself.  Secondly, if you're trying to get a JOB not just a freelance client they're hiring you. Not ServiceEase. So why bother with ServiceEase at all?"

You're able help people become their best selves, to assist them with a problem they're having, or even to make them feel better about themselves. It's problem solving at its core. Every single thing you do is a process. From your body waking up, to brushing your teeth, caring for your kids, going to work, any hobbies you have, etc. Some of these processes are inefficient or there are impediments that prevent you from your goals. Small enhancements, tweaks, or modifications can improve satisfaction. Satisfaction can absolutely be engineered. I love to help people.

So when I learned about how I could combine my understanding of Cognitive  Psychology and technology to make things easier to use and efficient, it was a simple decision - it's inevitable that I'm working in the UX world.

You can do it alone or with your client's direct involvement, but you can't give up on that task. It's just too important.  No navigation can accomodate an ""infinite number of nav items"" and still ""look good"". But, more importantly, no navigation defined in such a way will be remotely usable. My advice is: Work with your client in defining and refining the navigation (hopefully, with the input from user research and the validation of user testing). Only when you have defined a suitable logical structure, you can go ahead and select / design a navigation device that supports that structure."

UX work is not the same as UX theory, and we're always negotiating and making concesions in order to move the project forward.  However, you should ask yourself: Who will be held accountable in the future if, because of an overly complex and broad AI and navigation, the site/app flops catastrophically? The client or the designer?  That is to say that, maybe, you should stand your ground and insist on user research (at least a quick remote card sorting) to support an informed AI design. It's your responsability now, and it will be in the future specially if the current approach doesn't work. Which is a very likely scenario if you ask me.  All in all, good luck with your project!"

userexperience,35dpdz,gamzer,2,Sat May 9 09:17:48 2015 UTC,"I think the first point is a good one--if friction can create a sense of accomplishment or ""discovery"", it can create a great experience.    A better example, I think, can be found in video games such as Journey and Binding of Isaac.  The lack of in-game tutorial or instructions combined with simple gameplay mechanics make it easy enough to get started.  In Journey, it's your own curiosity, context clues, and desire to engage with a beautiful environment that helps you progress.  In Binding of Isaac, a far more punishing game, you basically fail repeatedly... but in doing so learn a little more here and there about the hundreds of randomized power-ups, enemies, bosses, etc., which helps you make more strategic decisions.  The key thing in these examples and with IKEA, is that if you're going to have friction for this sake, you need to know your user is committed to the experience and they're willing to show some patience.  In the context of something like... eCommerce... where another option is 2 seconds away... it'd be hard to apply this in principle."

Don't forget that the most important problem to solve should leads your product workflow.  Think about your boss as your main stakeholder. Someone with a specific product vision (that you can document and complement from another stakeholders), but most important, someone who wants the product to be released... use that commitment to involve him in the product definition, use his energy on setting solid grounds for the project.

Especially when I tried asking them questions about what niche it's satisfying or who they imagine using it, or details they want implemented, and they get frustrated with you.    You just deal with it.  You try your best, you artfully state any early objections (I try to ask questions that hopefully lead them to thinking they thought of the objections themselves, or gives them a nice way out without hurting their pride).  If that goes nowhere, a job is a job.  You do your best with what you're given, and more often than not (with a little perseverance) you can actually turn a pretty bad idea into something good.

Whenever someone says something that seems important to me at the time, I write it down along with notes I make about things I observer/notice about their behaviour. And when I say 'important' I mean basically everything 'new'  that they say about the product or service, whether it is good or bad.  After the session is over, usually before the same day is over, I go over the entire session again, play the video and read through my notes at the same time. I then make the notes digital, and noting down interesting time signatures along with it.  This has a couple of advantages in my experience, the fact that I hear everything twice is very nice. I might have missed something, or maybe missed the context of some remarks the users made. Secondly I have neatly structured digital notes that are easy to structure / track.

userexperience,34yjp3,punkhalfwit,5,Tue May 5 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"A modal is a special content container that's designed to sit on top of all other content and force the user to deal with whatever it is before moving on.  It is supposed to give you a choice, confirm an action, or otherwise interrupt the current process to force a specific decision.  It's called a ""modal"" because it changes the mode of the UI from that in which the user can access anything to one in which they must deal with only the decision immediately in front of them.  A great example of a use case for modals is a destructive action:  ""Are you sure you want to delete this record?  This action cannot be undone.""  A terrible way to use a modal is for a simple confirmation: ""You've successfully submitted a form!  Now click me to get rid of me because my designer decided to use a modal instead of an inline or top-of-the-page notification.""  Two rules of thumb that I try to always follow with modals:  Rule 1.  Don't use a modal unless you have to.  A modal interrupts the user's current task.  It impedes the ability to do anything other than what's right there in the modal, because it temporarily makes the entirety of the UI inaccessible until the modal is dismissed, either by clicking Okay/Cancel buttons, a close box, or (if the modal designer was nice) clicking the background/typing the Esc key.  Rule 2.  Don't put content that will have to scroll into a modal.  If content doesn't require you to limit access to everything else, don't.  You are already limiting the user's ability to use the entire site/app/whatever for the sake of putting your content into a modal.  Now we're talking about making them fill out a form before they can proceed, and we're even talking about making that form so long that it won't fit in a single page view, which also breaks rules about keeping forms simple and approachable.  Sometimes these rules are overruled by project stakeholders, but if I have any say in the matter at all, I try not to break them, ever."

userexperience,34yjp3,sluggernaut,1 point,Wed May 6 16:15:37 2015 UTC,What's the context/workflow?   I personally don't prefer them but it's hard to say without more information. Modals are usually quick in and out for me. Any reason why your users would need to move in and out of the form (to reference another page)?
userexperience,34yjp3,esbenab,1 point,Tue May 5 18:59:05 2015 UTC,The least you can do is split it into steps and show the user how far along they are.  O---O---O---*---O---O 4/6 <                   >
userexperience,34yjp3,digitalcth,1 point,Tue May 5 20:45:39 2015 UTC,"Splitting big forms and show a progress indicator is a ""good practice"": not only to reduce stress, you can take advantage to validate and save info as user advance, and show meaningful info/inputs according to their previous responses.  But I'wont recommend their use on modals; modals tends to indicate a forced ""sub-task"" part of a bigger workflow (thats why the ""background"" is partially visible: to maintain meaningful context), not an isolated primary task.  That ""background"" context in modals also refers to a phase in the workflow where you like to return to, without losing that particular state by moving to another place (maybe that's why you choose a modals in first place; if it's the case take a moment to rethink your whole ux).  So 1) if you don't need context, and 2) your form/content wont fit in a single page, don't use a modal.  But if 3) you must return to the exact same place and state (override point 1): use a ""fake-modal"" (a full size bigger view with splitted steps and smoothly return to the original page (you can use a soft bottom-top push animation))  good luck"
userexperience,34yjp3,Ezili,1 point,Wed May 6 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the paradigm/metaphor.   I think card metaphors with forms work fine for a modal. For example, see a list of cards on a page, click one to drill into it, maybe it has a form, or a comment field inside it you interact with. When you're done you drill out of the card/model and back to the overview page.   For example, Trello, Pintrest.  Or a modal might be part of a short wizard flow.   In general large forms should be avoided. More fields just mean more chances you user balks and decides not to complete the action. It looks overwhelming, and you may be asking for more information than the user wants to give. So finding ways to make filling out the form less overwhelming, or feel like a thing your user feels good about completing is important. But implementing interactions inside modals I don't think is inherently bad"

Overall it was a great experience and helped me a ton in starting my career.  • It was great for beginners/intermediate level. We learned the basics of front-end and visual design, as well as in depth tools and experience with UX/UI best practices. Only me and 2 other people had experience with front-end coding before the class, so don't worry about not being able to keep up. However, they do only touch on it for a week or less so it's up to you if you want to pursue the knowledge/skills further on your own after the course. I would highly recommend doing that.  • Don't get your hopes to high about getting hired immediately after the course. They offer all the help and guidance they possibly can through the job search. They have a 2 hour class every 2 weeks or so throughout the course that is dedicated to portfolio, resume, interviewing, and everything to do with getting hired. It was extremely helpful for me, and offers a ton of support(they still e-mail me often asking about my career search and offering any help they can). I think maybe 5 or 6 out of 23 of us were hired immediately after, and since then about 8 or 9 more have found jobs. I was hired a few months ago, and consider myself very lucky to find something(I live in CT, that's why!). I can tell you 100% that I would not have gotten this job if I didn't take the GA course. However, no matter what it will take tons of searching, applying, hustling, and networking to find something, especially if you are like me with little to no experience.  • The networking was very good in NYC. I made tons of friends and met lots of interesting people throughout. They have guest speakers from top design companies all around come and hang out and talk with the students, and I've made some pretty cool connections with people from places like Yahoo, Refinery 29, Huge, etc.  If I could make one recommendation, it is to do your ABSOLUTE BEST on the projects they have you complete during the course. This is what your portfolio will consist of at the end, and is what you'll be showing to potential employers, so make sure you do the cleanest and most thoughtful work. Use all the resources they have to the full extent, like asking for input from instructors and doing 1 on 1 sessions with them to improve your work. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me and I can give you more in depth answers about the course. Good luck!"

Within that container is the label and an HTML input with it’s borders removed via css which makes it sort of invisible.  I put together an example here: http://codepen.io/willthemoor/pen/dooRag"
userexperience,34unzq,kw_nj,3,Mon May 4 23:54:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the assumptions that post-fill scan of placeholder label fields is painful and slow. 90% of the time, the contents of any given input field is unique.  I know that something@else.com was an email field. I know what my first and last name are. I know what a phone number and address looks like.  I also know I'm not an idiot and wouldn't have filled out a field with completely incorrect information.  I can see this being useful on really, really, really long forms where users may forget the purpose of an initial field, but a short form like Facebook's signup needs no such post-fill reassurance - each field's filled input implies the field's purpose.  Personally, I think the proposed infield top aligned version of Facebook's signup form looks more cluttered and confusing than the current one does, despite the current one's eye-blocking white space.  The Treehouse example looks worse. With their current form, the fields are well separated and identifiable, the proposed design looks like a giant brick, it's actually hard to tell I'm even looking at a form."
userexperience,34unzq,phpdevster,2,Tue May 5 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with your email address example but for inputs that are less common or conflict with other inputs on the form having labels always visible will bring clarity.

What tool works for the project depends on the logistical details of that project: how many people, how detailed the work break-down, how many 3rd parties to wait for, etc.   Some tools are tailored to the project mgmt methodology: ITIL for instance requires specific steps with everything you do, and an ITIL mgmt tool should help us remember such things.  I find that project mgmt tools are used mostly to show a nice graph of how much time is left, and whether execution is on budget.   We have chosen to reduce the overhead of large-scale mgmt tools unless the client requires it (like with an ITIL organisation), and use simple spreadsheets and timelines instead."

Also, although nothing to do with UX, the subscription does not tie you in - you can take the discount and cancel after the first delivery so I don't think it's overly driven by management money-grabbing.
