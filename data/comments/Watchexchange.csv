Includes everything: Both original straps Original box and tool for changing straps Manual and stamped warranty card  Condition: Purchase from local jeweler in May, this watch is in GREAT condition. Minor scratches on the buckle (as seen in picture). Also minor scuff on lug on crown side—attempted to capture in pictures but it’s extremely hard to see, you have to get the light just right in order to see it, couldn’t capture it on camera, you really have to be looking for it. Otherwise watch is basically flawless (see pictures).  It is reference number: H35405741  This is the exact model: http://www.hamiltonwatch.com/collection/american-classic/timeless-classic/pan-europ-auto/h35405741  Any questions, let me know.

I try to keep all watches in my collection as original as possible. The watches are in varying conditions (generally very good). All prices excluding shipping, although deals can be made. I live in Belgium, Europe, but I have no problem shipping worldwide. It's easy, fast and cheap. In the past I've already shipped a lot of watches to the US, without any issues whatsoever.  Shipping worldwide is about $15.  If you want more info/pictures on a watch, PM me.  Here's the list of watches from left to right. Either send me an edit of the first picture with all the watches you like circled, or send me the corresponding numbers of the watches you like. Obviously telling me ""I like that steel one"" isn't going to work.  I've got plenty more that I'm likely going to sell in the future, but I only list a couple each time. Let me know if there's a specific watch you're looking for, and I might be able to help you out. Also, if you're looking for vintage boxes, or full sets (watches with boxes and papers), I also have a few that I'm thinking of selling (not as many as last edition though hehehehe).  All watches work well and keep good time  From left to right:   Omega Seamaster 600 - gold plated, manual wind cal 611 from 1966, ref 136.012 - $300 - pics: http://imgur.com/a/1bJzM Omega Constellation - gold plated, automatic cal 564 from 1967, ref CD 168.017 SP - $500 (disregard the scratches on the crystal, I have to polish the crystal) - pics: http://imgur.com/a/foxNG Linen dial Omega Seamaster 30 - gold plated, manual wind cal 286 from 1962,ref 135.007-62 - 35mm without crown - $400 - pics: http://imgur.com/a/sAbme Omega chubby Seamaster automatic black gilt dial - steel case, automatic cal 491 from 1957, ref 2846-8SC, 2848 - $600 - pics: http://imgur.com/a/MUgMv   PM me with any questions.

Watchexchange,3e2gr9,Dangld,0,Tue Jul 21 22:31:55 2015 UTC,timekeeping is plus 26 seconds/day = +26s/d :)
Watchexchange,3e2gr9,unforced_error,3,Tue Jul 21 23:03:10 2015 UTC,You know that's really bad right?
Watchexchange,3e2gr9,unforced_error,-2,Tue Jul 21 23:54:20 2015 UTC,A non-COSC watch you can expect a reasonable variance of up to 10 seconds/day. A vintage watch (25 yrs old) in good repair you have a reasonable expectation of 1 minute variance a day per Chronocentric.  So for a 17 year old watch I think it's right in line with what one would expect. Also accuracy you need really depends on how you're planning to use it. If you wear watches on rotation and don't use an electrical winder it will never vary long enough for it to matter. If it's a daily driver you'd probably want to get it regulated. If I want accuracy day in and day out I'll wear a quartz (+/-2s/d) I'm all for full disclosure so I'm putting it out there for the buyer to decide. Better to lay it out than not to mention it in the hopes of some n00b not knowing any better.
Watchexchange,3e2gr9,unforced_error,2,Wed Jul 22 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"Baloney.   I JUST bought a mint Speedmaster Reduced last week with no service history and it runs at +7s/day. The previous owner wore it occasionally but kept it mostly in a box unwound. This is Omega we're talking about here not some run-of-the-mill manufacturer.  In fact, I just sold a 1954 LeCoultre Memovox cal. 814 (without any shock protection) that ran at -/+ 15s/day that definitely hadn't been serviced based on the condition of the movement."

Watchexchange,3dp4ve,dallasishere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, I had lots of interest in this guy however here it stands. Lets try again, for sale is my hand-winding Omega Cal 268 (which is based on the 30T2) dating to approx. 1961, case reference 14391. Everything on this watch is original and it runs perfectly, winds smoothly and keeps great time. On this model, the seconds are shown in the sub-second dial at the bottom. The watch comes on a very soft Armani leather strap with Omega buckle. The crystal has recently been replaced and has no scratches or scuffs. The case measures 35mm without crown making it quite a big watch for this time period. This watch has fantastic wrist presence and makes for a perfect addition to any vintage collection. The patina on the dial is subtle but really adds to the look of the watch. The crown is the original crown to this watch, and a previous owner has apparently made some of the notches in this crown larger for easier winding. Unfortunately I have chosen not to open up the back of this watch because I do not have a case back closer and last time I opened it, it took me a good 15min to close it again, however I assure you the movement is clean and I’ve attached a stock photo for reference. As I am a private seller, I, like many who sell vintage watches, do not accept returns, however I ask that you feel free to contact me if there are any issues whatsoever Now only asking only $300 + $20 worldwide shipping"

It's pretty overwhelming as there is so much selection to choose from so I'll try to make this as helpful as I can.   First, you question would much better be addressed in /r/watches. They are very knowledgable about helping everyone there as they are very passionate about the art.   Second, for that budget it wouldn't be too hard to find a watch. A large part of the community believe that Timex is a great company to start with and are advocates of the Timex Weekender. The Timex Easy Reader has a pretty simple face as well. It is currently on Amazon for about 30 dollars.   Linked: http://www.amazon.com/Timex-T2H281-Reader-Silver-Tone-Leather/dp/B000AYYIYU/ref=sr_1_4?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1437123682&sr=1-4&keywords=watch&refinements=p_n_material_browse%3A379287011%2Cp_36%3A-5000&pebp=1437123773377&perid=04HY87ES0ST09P000NNX  The word simple is objective, as there are many other forms of categories as well, such as aviator, diver, dress, casual and so on and so forth. It would be helpful to know more about what you want.  If this is a collection, I suggest starting off with a casual. Go to /r/ watches and figure out the best thing that you want, or just opt for a Weekender, as it has become a good staple in watches.   Just make sure you stray away from the Chinese watches. Although affordable, they don't stay in a collection too long. The higher end ones may be more reliable, but nothing at your price range. Best of luck, PM me if you need help.   Cheers"

Watchexchange,3dlln0,MGNero3,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"I'm really against the whole ""save up for a watch"" idea.  If you need to save up for a particular watch then you should probably not get it and spend that money on something more important. Most people who buy Rolexes buy them without saving up. Same deal if you're looking to save up for a $200 watch. If you don't have $200 to throw on a watch at any time then the $200 you saved up would have been of more use to you going toward your rent, bills, food, etc. Just my two cents."
Watchexchange,3dlln0,saifly,2,Fri Jul 17 19:31:28 2015 UTC,I think you entirely misinterpreted the gist of what I'm saying. I am not telling him to take money he needs for food or rent and throw it away on a watch I am saying if he has left over money after he pays for all his necessities +emergency fund+ whatever he feels is more important then he could put a small bit away for a watch. Or the budget he has for his watch.   People choose to save up for certain things. That does not mean all of your excess money goes towads that thing. If this guy wants a quality watch that will last him a while it might serve him best to wait a year or two and then buy a phenomenal watch. Until then he can use the watch I recommended.

The only issue with this watch is that the thin bezel ring that surrounds the crystal is missing. I’ve worn this watch plenty and this has not bothered me, however if you kept your eyes open you could surely have this replaced for very cheap. Anyways, this watch is all original and features the hand-winding cal 1030, which is keeping great time. The brown dial is really an eye-catcher and is in near perfect condition. The crystal is an original Omega with stamp, aligned correctly. What makes this piece such a great buy is that I will also be including the original 1283/247 bracelet, which is in great condition aside from two tiny dents in the clasp. These bracelets can fetch over $100 alone. The service history is unknown however the movement is very clean and winds very smoothly. The tiny scratches seen in the photos will be polished out to the best of my ability previous to sale. Due to past experiences, I, like many who sell vintage watches, am not able to accept returns, however if buyers have any problems I invite them to please contact me ASAP. Asking only SOLD!plus  $15 worldwide shipping which includes insurance"

I'm slowly nearing the end, all thanks to you.   I try to keep all watches in my collection as original as possible. The watches are in varying conditions (generally very good). All prices excluding shipping, although deals can be made. I live in Belgium, Europe, but I have no problem shipping worldwide. It's easy, fast and cheap. In the past I've already shipped a lot of watches to the US, without any issues whatsoever.  Shipping worldwide is about $15.  If you want more info/pictures on a watch, PM me.  Here's the list of watches from left to right. Either send me an edit of the first picture with all the watches you like circled, or send me the corresponding numbers of the watches you like. Obviously telling me ""I like that steel one"" isn't going to work.  I've got plenty more that I'm likely going to sell in the future, but I only list a couple each time. Let me know if there's a specific watch you're looking for, and I might be able to help you out. Also, if you're looking for vintage boxes, or full sets (watches with boxes and papers), I also have a few that I'm thinking of selling (not as many as last edition though hehehehe).

My 1016 Explorer is comparatively tiny and light but is a joy on the wrist; my 1675 GMT (today's watch) perfectly proportioned and an utter classic, my 5513 Sub is drop-dead gorgeous on a crimson horween strap, my 16550 (white) is a beauty and on a white strap ideal for summer activities.  Each of these watches when on the wrist becomes my favourite for the day.  Nobody can argue that Rolex's modern offerings are anything less than well-designed technical masterpieces built to a ridiculously high standard, but they are big.  If you want watches that are arguably better designed and just a little more reasonably sized...go vintage.  You don't even have to go very vintage to get a 5513 or 14060M or 16750 etc, and ones that have been through RSC service have had their old parts replaced new, so are essentially new watches.

These pics don't do the beauty of the watch justice.  Up for sale is a steel Omega Seamaster 30. It's a reference 135.003-62 SC, powered by a manual wind cal 286 from 1962 in very good condition.   The case is clean and in very good condition. The crown and crystal are signed. The dial is all original and in very good condition. The watch is 35mm diameter without crown, and 42mm from from lug to lug. The movement is clean, the watch works perfectly and keeps great time.  Selling for $550 including worldwide shipping! - Also open for offers.  I've got many references on WUS, and plenty of people on Reddit that can vouch for me.

I'm sad to get rid of this watch but it was a gift from an ex and I don't like being reminded of her when I wear it. She gave to me new in December 2014.  I'll spare the break up details but the watch is a 40mm stainless steel case, Swiss made analog quartz movement, and scratch resistant, anti-reflective, sapphire crystal. The watch is water resistant up to 100 meters. I think the black dial and white Victorinox logo gives the watch a really sharp look. I particularly liked the military hours along the inner dial. The hour and minute hands are luminescent as well as hour dot markers around the outer edge of the dial. Date is displayed at 6:00 above the ""Swiss Made"" mark. The strap is original black leather, 20mm, with a prong buckle closure and the Victorinox logo on the buckle. There is some minor wear to the strap at the fourth hole where I wore it and there is also a minor knick in the bottom edge of the case to the right of the crown as shown in one of the photos.   The watch keeps excellent time, the crystal has no scratches, and I've had no problems with the watch since I've had it. I'm asking $150 but I will consider reasonable offers or interesting trades."

I like the band it comes with but I have large wrists and Seiko only makes the links in gold now so I cant expand it and don't really want to try and find a new band for it.  I have a couple gold links that they sent me which I'll include.  There are light scratches on the band from normal wear around an office/home.  I took the pictures in bright light to accentuate the light scratching so you can see it but it is not very apparent in normal light.  Just something that comes with smooth metal bands like that.    I paid a little over $200 for this watch and am asking $175 shipped via USPS priority to the US.  I still have the box and 2 manuals which I'll include.

Slightly smaller than the other one, but still a rather big size; 35mm diameter without crown, 41mm lug to lug. - $650 Omega automatic Geneve blue dial - 1960's. The crystal has plenty of scratches, but the dial underneath is pristine, with nicely aged lume on both the hands and the dial. The watch works well and keeps good time. 35mm diameter without crown, 40,5mm lug to lug - $500 Omega automatic champagne honeycomb dial - a very early 1955 cal 501. This watch is a bit simpler than the others, but still a beauty. It's powered by the cal 501, which was introduced in 1955 as well. It works well and keeps good time. 34mm diameter without crown, 41mm from lug to lug - $450 - SOLD   PM me with any questions/offers.  OPEN FOR OFFERS.

Watchexchange,3b7nxg,nickp08,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:56:50 2015 UTC,I've had and sold a handful (including two from this gentleman right here)- they're really awesome watches. JM was a brand of NYC based Palmer Corp and imported and rebranded high quality swiss watches. Every one that I've seen is solid steel (not plated) and killer movements. One was a rebranded Jaquet Girard with a Supercompressor case. I have a friend who had one that was made by Wakmann/Breitling down to the signature on the movement. Great stuff for the price.

Watchexchange,3b7k0z,dallasishere,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:37:13 2015 UTC,"For sale is a really nice 1950s Omega Cal 283, keeping great time for a vintage. This watch is hand-winding and operates very smoothly. There is absolutely no tarnish or rust/wear to be seen in the movement. In the pictures you can see the very slight little pressure cracks in the crystal, these cannot be felt, nor are they generally that obvious when wearing the watch. Regardless, a new generic crystal would only cost you ~$10 if this were bothersome to you. The watch comes on a brand new NATO with gold hardware, which goes with this watch perfectly. The watch has been well taken care of and the gold plating is largely intact with the only obvious signs of wear being at the ends of the lugs.  SOLD which includes Paypal fees and worldwide shipping from Canada."

Watchexchange,3apwtg,Kyle_CK,4,Mon Jun 22 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have a beautiful Omega Speedmaster Ref. 3510.50 w/ Box for Sale.  I bought this watch about 3 weeks ago from a seller in Japan on ebay, and while I absolutely love this watch, some other stuff has come up and I need the money more than I need the watch.   So, more about the watch: This is a Reduced Speedmaster Ref. 3510.50, and the case measures about 38.5mm wide, which is great for smaller wrists. Also, rather than being handwinding like most Speedmasters, this has an automatic movement. Subdials are swapped, but the chronograph function of course remains.  Condition: Overall I'd say this watch is in good used, but certainly not abused condition. Yes, there are scratches, but all are light- there are no deep scratches, dents or dings on the case, or anywhere on the watch. Face has a great look to it- the lume and hands are starting to patina, which I think looks great, although of course the lume doesn't work very well anymore!  Being an acrylic crystal, it does scratch very easily, and this one does have some light scratches. These scratches show up more in pictures than they do in real life- when on the wrist you cannot even see the scratches, and visibility is excellent. This watch has the original crystal also- it is hard to photograph, but there is an Omega symbol right in the middle of the crystal.  This watch functions fantastically. It is accurate to less than 8 seconds a day, which is brilliant for an older watch. Power reserve seems to be around 40 hours. Chronograph works well, pushers have a very positive action, and the chrono-hand returns in an instant when you reset.   Bracelet is much like the case- some scratches, but nothing unusual- one note here is that the bracelet will only fit a 6.9"" wrist at maximum, I did not get anymore links when I bought the watch. Clasp is very solid, and of course this watch has great solid end links.   This watch includes the original boxes, user manual, and card holder.  I am selling this watch for $1200 + $15 shipping within the US, which is a great deal for one of these, and less than what I wound up paying 3 weeks ago. Thanks for looking, and feel free to message me if you have any questions. I am a reputable ebay seller, here is my ebay account."

Both these watches were bought by me and I am the only owner of these. G-Shock was bought in fall 2014, and Orvis was bought in December 2014. Trying to trade these to get into the vintage market.   The Orvis description from the site: It's the timepiece you want on your wrist when split-seconds count. Crafted in stainless steel, and sporting a bold racing-green color motif, our chronograph watch features a 1/20-second measurement dial for precision accuracy. The large sweep-second hand measures timed seconds; a standard second-hand dial is at six o'clock, an hour indicator dial is at 9 o'clock. Calendar date window. Subtle perforated leather strap. Case diameter 45mm. Water resistant to 150 feet. 4-year battery. Imported.   I’ve only had the Orvis for a few months now and there a few, tiny scratches on it. The leather band is broken in, and you can’t see it in the pictures, but there are green dots in the leather holes as a part of the band! It comes with its original box, but I do not have the papers. Runs well.   The G-Shock: This one is just too big on my wrist for me to really ever wear. It does have some cosmetic problems, though. As you can see in the pictures, it is missing it’s bar and clasp for it, but still has the band for it. Other than that it works fine and keeps time perfectly. All features of it function well, and there are little to no scratches on it, besides the metal band. Comes with box and warranty card, but no manual. Case diameter 5.4 centimeters Case Thickness  18.2 millimeters  G-Shock description: Introducing RANGEMAN, the latest addition to the Master of G series of tough and rugged timepieces that are designed and engineered to stand up to the most grueling conditions imaginable. RANGEMAN employs a Shock Resistant Triple Sensor, which makes it capable of keeping altitude, barometric pressure, temperature and direction readings at your fingertips. Cylindrical buttons provide outstanding operation and improved resistance to impact. The frequently used sensor button (center right) has a metal cover that protects it against lateral impact and keeps foreign matter out. Pressing the sensor button in any mode takes you directly to a sensor screen. Each sensor mode has its own audible tone, which means you can determine which mode you are entering without even looking at the watch. All of this plus sunrise/sunset data, one-touch time recording, one-touch elapsed time measurement, world-renowned G-Shock toughness and durability, and much more makes RANGEMAN the perfect choice for rangers, rescue crews, and anyone else whose profession or activities demand unfailing reliability. Green resin band digital watch with black face, orange accents on the dial and the side button. • Multi-Band 6 Atomic Timekeeping • Tough Solar • Triple Sensor (Altimeter/Barometer, Thermometer and Compass) • Shock Resistant  I'm in the Continental US so I'm really okay with shipping anywhere here, and anywhere else. If you have any questions feel free to ask me! I'd be more than happy to oblige."

Watchexchange,3afale,bballbuck,2,Fri Jun 19 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"NO LONGER AVAILABLE  I picked up this Parnis about a month ago. It was my first experience with a Parnis watch. I have to say, I'm impressed with the quality and I love the look - however, it's just a little too big for me.   The watch comes on a custom brown leather strap with blue threading (which looks nice with the blue hands of the watch). The strap is actually not exactly the right size, as you can see in the pictures (there is a small gap in between the strap and the lugs). It doesn't bother me personally, but just want to make sure its disclosed. I will also include the black leather strap the watch came with.  Here is an album of pictures I posted to /r/watches - imgur. As you can see, there are two watches in the album - only the Parnis is available.  More info on the watch:  Size: 43mm x 15mm  Movement: SeaGull 2542 Power Reserve Automatic Movement  Functions: Hour,minutes,small seconds,power reserve  Case: Brushed 316L Stainless Steel Case  Crystal: Special Scratch Proof Mineral Crystal  Dial: White Dial with Blue Numbers  Bazel: Polished Bezel  Clasp: Brushed Pre-V Buckle  Water resistance: 3 ATM"

Watchexchange,3ae3gl,bigpoppa822,3,Fri Jun 19 11:06:09 2015 UTC,"Hi thank you for your concerns. I am unsure about what you are trying to accuse me off?  The logo is actually my avatar over on WUS, and my profile pic on Instagram. And was made up primarily to avoid people copying my photo's and putting the supposed watches (they didn't have) on Ebay. It has happened quite a bit this year and figured it is an easy way to 'watermark'my pics. As is the name. It is my username on WUS and here.  I am not a professional as in I do not even remotely sell enough watches to warrant this to be a job, do not have a store etc.   I do however buy watches with the intent to flip them as does the majority off the contributors of this sub.  It is a fun way to try on a lot off watches and keep a dynamic in my collection.  And as John Mayer said in a recent article; You are not a collector if you haven't sold 12 watches.  Therefore I have a 'business card'; if a person wants to sell a watch or find out some more information about an attic find they might remember the little card in their wallets sooner than they do a name on a forum.  And who knows I can strike a deal without ever having to compete with other collectors over the broad scope of the internet.   You'll notice a lot of collectors have put up these 'personal info' cards to broaden their network.  I hope to have settled this for you. But I must add I do not like the way you handled this. Some tact and an open mind might have benefitted the situation more.  Cheers"

The fact that you do understand why your comments are getting down votes likely makes this explanation irrelevant, as you seem to have an aversion to criticism... As u/bromezz mentioned, you should expect that people are going to try and negotiate when you post something for sale on the Internet. It is pretty standard. Now, when most people negotiate and there is a disagreement on price and neither party is willing to budge, you go your separate ways and that is that. However, your reaction to everyone who disagrees on price has been hostile and unnecessarily defensive. Essentially no one gives a shit that you disagree on price, it is just the way you react to it that earns you down votes. Hope that helps."

Watchexchange,39ysr4,baldylox,2,Mon Jun 15 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"The Bulova Accutron Astronaut is the most collectable (and IMHO coolest) of all the vintage Accutron 'tuning fork' watches'.   Bulova began developing the Accutron in 1952. A vintage Accutron is to an electronic watch that's guaranteed accurate to within 2 seconds a day, or 1 minute a month. The secret behind this inherent accuracy will be a tuning fork which will divide each second into hundreds of equal parts.   In 1960 NASA asks Bulova to incorporate Accutron technology into its equipment for the space program. The CEO of Bulova at the time was Omar Bradley, 5 Star General, US Army, Retired. During those early years Accutron timing mechanisms were used in 46 US space program missions. An Accutron watch movement sits on the moon's Sea of Tranquility today, in an instrument placed there in 1969 by Apollo 11 astronauts, the first men on the moon.  For collectors of 'space watches' - this is one of their 'grails'. For collectors of any watches, it's a wonderful piece in immaculate condition that's sure to get attention and be an interesting conversation piece.   If you've never had an Accutron 'tuning fork' watch, they're fun, believe me. They do not tick. They 'hum'. The second hand moves around the dial smoother than any other watch ever made.   This watch is a 1968 Accutron Astronaut with a caliber 214.NA electronic movement, the most accurate movement available until the advent of quartz watches.   This watch has been completely serviced by a certified Bulova Accutron technician/watchmaker. Comes with a 1-year warranty from the watchmaker himself. A brand new crystal and battery has been installed.  No worries - batteries are still readily available for these watches. The caliber 214 movements use a Duracell #387 or #394, a very common battery available at virtually everywhere watch batteries are sold. Hint: you can get 10 of them on Amazon for the price of one at the store. Also, many jewelers replace watch batteries for free as a service and means of getting you in the door.  The watch measures 38mm across the rotating bezel. The bezel, case, caseback, and bracelet are all stainless steel. The Bracelet is the J.B. Chamion 'bullet' variant.    $1695. PayPal and all major credit cards accepted. Partial trades may be considered.   PM for more info. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions. Thanks for looking!"

Watchexchange,39nxok,Liberalguy123,2,Sat Jun 13 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"This is a stainless steel Omega Seamaster Automatic from 1962. It carries the 552 caliber. It has the original hands, dial, crystal, crown, caseback, everything! The screw down caseback has the traditional Seamaster Hippocampus, and screws down tightly with the original rubber seal.  The watch is 35mm in diameter not including the crown. It takes 18mm bands. Currently it has an old brown leather band with a stainless steel buckle.   The movement is running strong and seems to be keeping good time in the last 24 hours.   The case is in very good condition, with the normal scratches and marks you would expect on a 53-year-old watch. The crystal has a few deep scratches and several smaller ones. It is very wearable as-is, but you may want to change it.   Asking $400 OBO, shipped from Southern California.

I bought this watch about 3 months ago and wore it for about a week and haven't worn it since. As a result, it is in great shape.   I believe the pictures show the condition of the watch very well. The case has a few very light scratches, as does the bracelet. (Anything that looks like scratches on the bezel is just dust.) The acrylic crystal has a few small scratches, but I will buff them out with Polywatch before I ship (I have a tube of Polywatch coming tomorrow from Amazon).  As you can see this watch has the beautiful exhibition caseback to be able to view the Seagull ST19 movement.  I have the filled out warranty card from Alpha, which is good for one year after purchase date as well as the admittedly crappy pouch it came in. Also included is a 20mm red white and blue NATO strap that fits the Alpha, as well as the extra links to the bracelet.   I am asking $170 shipped (in US) for this beautiful watch.

Watchexchange,3923m6,PoorAuthor9,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"This NOMOS Ahoi Datum was purchased one year ago from an American AD, and therefore has one year remaining on its original warranty. It comes with the original waterproof strap, manual/warranty booklet,  black wood box and cleaning cloth.  It comes in great condition, with only little signs of wear (look at pictures for details!). It was never swam in or worn during labor or anything like that.   In regards to the condition of the movement, it's running fantastically. It is variable depending on how much you wear it and how you store it, but it lost about 10 seconds over the past month while I wore it.   It costs +$4000 to buy it new from NOMOS, and around $3000 from grey-market and used sellers. I had it priced at $2800, but would like to sell it soon, so I have reduced it to a very low $2700. This includes PayPal's 3% fee as well as the shipping costs. You'll be hard-pressed to find the Ahoi Datum for this low of a price in such good condition.   I'll also provide a detailed bill of sale in case you want to get it insured by your insurance company and don't have access to a NOMOS AD that can appraise it for you.

I'm looking for $110 + shipping (usually ~$5), preferably to CONUS but international is okay too- via Paypal, I take care of fees.    Most of you are I'm sure aware of the Orient Ray, but if not...  Diameter: 41.5mm  Lug width: 22mm  Lug to Lug: 46mm  Movement: Orient Cal 46943 automatic 21600bph  Water resistance: 200m  Look closely at the pictures cause that's the watch you'll get.  It's got some minor desk diving scratches on the bracelet, and there's a small scratch on the mineral crystal at 4 o'clock, roughly 2mm in length.  I never notice it unless I really look for it.  The stock springbars are slightly bent so I'm including two fatboy 2.5mm bars for free!  They won't fit the bracelet but they'll fit any aftermarket strap you decide to throw on there.  All OEM links included and bracelet is currently sized to 7"" wrist.  Thanks for looking!"

Serial is visible under the bracelet, but I didn't remove it (in case I scratch it). I can remove it to verify again. I purchased the watch from Ben Bridge's used watch sale in March and is still under their 1 year warranty to original owner (me).

The watch is great but I wound up not wearing it as much as I thought I would and these days it just sits receiving the occasional wind to keep it in good shape. It’s only very lightly used and is in excellent condition. I’ve worn it maybe 4 or 5 times since I’ve received it, otherwise it’s been sitting in my watch case begging for use.  This watch is the skeleton version of the Zelos Chroma. The jet turbine style cutouts reveal the skeletonized Miyota 8N24 automatic movement below. The watch also has a display caseback showing the rose gold plated rotor. The rotor is a nice subtle decorative touch. The case itself is lugless and is affixed to a 20mm black leather strap with white stitching.  The watch comes with its stainless steel engraved warranty card. The watch does not come with a box.  Asking price is $225. Shipping to CONUS is free, for other locations buyer will be responsible for shipping from US zip 02911.  If there are any questions please don’t hesitate to ask. Thanks!"

Watchexchange,37rlja,GreyFox422,2,Fri May 29 20:46:38 2015 UTC,I've been debating between a Hamilton Khaki and a Tissot PRC 200. Why don't you like your Le Locle?
Watchexchange,37rlja,GreyFox422,3,Fri May 29 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's more of a function thing. There are two times I'd really wear the Tissot -- when I'm at work, or at a semi-professional event.   I'm selling it to help fund a Speedmaster, and the Speedmaster will takeover at work, and I don't go to formal events much anymore. The Hamilton is more more lax, and frankly I'd feel less bad about banging it up. The Tissot is gorgeous and was my first real watch, but a little too formal/redundant in my rotation right now."

Watchexchange,37ml24,PoorAuthor9,3,Thu May 28 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"This NOMOS Ahoi Datum was purchased one year ago from an American AD, and therefore has one year remaining on its original warranty. It comes with the original waterproof watch strap, manual/warranty booklet, as well as the original box and cleaning cloth.  It comes in great condition, with minimal signs of wear (no major scratching) and it still looks newly polished. I love this watch, but am selling it to downgrade to a NOMOS Club and use the extra money for traveling and school.   In regards to the condition of the movement, it's running fantastically. It's only off by about .5-1 second a day, which is fantastic.   It costs +$4000 to buy it new from NOMOS, and around $3000 from grey-market and used sellers. The $2800 includes priority (3-day) shipping and the 3% PayPal fees. You can get this lovely watch by the beginning of next week, just in time for the summer months."
