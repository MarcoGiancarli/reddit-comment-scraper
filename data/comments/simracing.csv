simracing,3e3i09,shadowofashadow,6,Tue Jul 21 17:53:59 2015 UTC,You'd need a pretty powerful laptop to game at 3x the resolution.
simracing,3e3i09,Mr_Clovis,3,Tue Jul 21 22:22:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is super! Great innovation in terms of usability. So far I've only see triple screens with separate monitors, so this concept is great. Hope it gets applied to more portable products."
simracing,3e3i09,quffy,3,Tue Jul 21 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"While I get the more business like and personal gaming applications, I laughed a bit at the part of the video where what looks like a father turns around a screen so his son can see. (All assumptions of course, but in terms of advertising, a homely setting, a grey-haired man and a young guy with a hoodie is a father and son to me :p). Why?  Because 'fuck you son, you don't get to sit on this couch next to me, you stay over there at the kid's table'. I mean any time you want to share your screen with multiple people, you'd just gather them round your screen for a small group, and you'd simply need a larger screen for a large group cause of the viewing distance their required seating space implies.  Oh well, for triple screen gaming it seems like it could be good, you'll need a laptop that can handle 3x the resolution of course."
simracing,3e3i09,GTOfire,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"That seems like a pretty good idea and it's actually rather well priced. Personally I think I would rather spend the money on a VR Headset (if it's compatible with my laptop,) but I can see this becoming a pretty popular thing."
simracing,3e3i09,FanboyThompson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:54 2015 UTC,Not exactly sure how compatible this would be with gaming but the first thing I thought of when I saw it was simracing.
simracing,3e3i09,Cheesenium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"Call me a skeptic as I don't think this will work for racing. There are 2 main problems.   The first one is performance where a good gaming capable laptop generally cost at least $2000 that comes with a 980M these days. A 980M is about as powerful as a 960Ti in a desktop which isn't the best performance. You need 2 980M to get performance that is comparable to a desktop version of 980. This also means that the laptop will be more expensive. Also, consider that a mobile CPU is far weaker than the desktop version, you are paying a premium for much weaker performance than a desktop. There are also heat concerns as these cards run very close to thermal limit. It is common to see a high end mobile GPU running at 95C in some models because most manufacturer values thinness over heat dissipation efficiency. Lastly, with such powerful hardware, you definitely look for power socket constantly on the go. The most you can get out from a laptop for gaming is typically 2 hours.   The second problem is, how are you going to bring your wheel around? They are generally heavy and hard to move around. At the end, do you want to use a gamepad to play your favorite game on an expensive hardware?   IMO, this is quite impractical for ""mobile"" racers. Still, I think this product is interesting because it will make working on a laptop a better experience. Gaming on a triple screen laptop is impractical IMO until the day mobile GPU can offer similar performance as desktop counterpart with good thermals."

simracing,3e2m9d,sparrow560,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"It's really great! I love Stock Car Extreme, but there weren't a lot of options to race online.   So this evening I tried doing a couple of races online. The first one was with Formula V12 @ Montreal historic. After qualifying 3rd I caught a guy who spun in front of me and my car switched off (forgot to put the auto clutch!).   So second race, this time on a different server. MetalMoro @ Curitiba. I qualified 2nd, but in the first few laps I made a lot of mistakes. Other guys made mistakes as well, so with 15 minutes to go I was roughly 17 seconds behind P1. The good thing is that I was quite a bit faster than him, but he was very consistent. So I had to focus a lot for the last 15 minutes and I caught him and overtook him with one minute to go. It was very intense and it was awesome to win the race!  Anyway, I was surprised with the quality of the drivers. They were all very respectful and clean. Sure, there were a lot of off tracks, but that's because there's not enough time to learn properly the track. But it's still public server racing, and it's the best I've had, honestly. Both races had more or less 6 people. Not a lot, but not too few, to be honest. Hopefully more and more people will join."
simracing,3e2m9d,Yoshitsunee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:04 2015 UTC,iRacing may need to review their pricing if this takes off.  Interesting that Grand Prix Legends had VROC 15 years ago and it worked better than pretty much any public racing available today.

simracing,3e3nb3,Vash744,5,Tue Jul 21 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"Only get mods from the official forums or racedepartment. Stuff elsewhere is a mixed bag of the same stuff but older versions and more to the point the flood of completely shit forza and pcars rips from a bunch of bent Russians, who rip the CAD, copy some sounds over and call themselves modders.    All of the stuff from the two sources above is usually 100% working and of good quality. Occasionally core game updates do cause issues with sound but they soon update the mods to suit."
simracing,3e3nb3,welded_sheep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"I only found out about the official forum hosting mods after I installed these. I'll definitely check it out. I did get some of my mods from Racedepartment however, but their site's layout is a bit odd for filtering mods. I assume if I want good mods I have to go by the most recently added? Most downloaded/top rated etc. have old mods in those lists.  BTW here is that car pack I was attempting to get to work: http://acmods.net/cars/sp-mod/  Last updated seems to be March of this year."
simracing,3e3nb3,GTOfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"I can't say much about acmods since I only just checked it out, but it seems just a page they made to insert some ad-revenue to other's work. Looking at the car page it's stuff that's all available on race department and was uploaded there and not to acmods. I also can't say for sure because it might simply have a rounding error or slight difference in calculation but the file for the 288 GTO I can download from their alternate source is 81,8 Mb according to Firefox. The source file I uploaded to racedepartment (and ONLY there mind you) on my machine is 81,7 according to windows. Might be nothing, but I'm not going to download it to make sure :p  Basically it doesnt look like a page worth visiting. Pretty much every modder who makes scratch made quality mods uploads their stuff to RD, despite their atrocious search/filter functions (or lack thereof). Any other page, and especially one who doesn't even link to the RD page but has their own version uploaded irks me in a bad way."
simracing,3e3nb3,djfil007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"as others mentioned, cars are the worst because of the continuous FMOD updates.  every time Kunos updates FMOD in Assetto Corsa, every car mod needs to be updated.  tracks aren't as much of a pain, except that they recently added the filtering\grouping options."
simracing,3e3nb3,quffy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:43 2015 UTC,This is pure BS. There was only one time that FMOD required modders to update the compilation of the sounds. The next update v1.2 was said that it won't break mods.
simracing,3e3nb3,GTOfire,4,Tue Jul 21 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"sound mods have been broken more than once for sure, another time it was the aero.ini. It's not usually a massive issue, but it's definitely annoying, especially if the modders aren't keeping up to date with AC anymore."
simracing,3e3nb3,quffy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"aero.ini broke the car from loading in the track, nothing sound related. The fix could be done by everybody, since it just required to delete the [data] section from aero.ini, since it was an obsolete part."
simracing,3e3nb3,russlar,3,Tue Jul 21 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing FMOD updates with AC updates. Not every update to AC will update FMOD, but everytime FMOD does get an update the mod cars need to update to fix sounds."
simracing,3e3nb3,quffy,0,Tue Jul 21 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"When was the other FMOD update that broke the sounds? From what I remember, this only happened with v1.1.5 game update, that also coincided with an fmod update. Of course I can put the possibility that it happened in the past even if I'm not aware, but is to be expected since this fmod sound engine was brought mid project, and is not a small thing to work on.  People need to be more considerate about Kunos work, especially since they are working on the game as a whole, so if something appears that stop mods from working, is because the update was necessary and there is some game improvement in between.  I bet some people will tell me ""oh rf2 never broke mods etc."" That's because their sound engine is in completed state, and is something integrated in the game from the get go. AC also had their sound engine integrated in the game, that never broke mods. But now they are using FMOD, a sound engine from a 3rd party, so these things can't be much compared, since the previous in-house built sound engine never broke any sounds.  And the benefits of fmod are well seen, specially on mods which can have great sounds."
simracing,3e3nb3,RenditionVerite,0,Tue Jul 21 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"I bet some people will tell me ""oh rf2 never broke mods etc."" That's because their sound engine is in completed state   rFactor2's sound engine got multiple updates and additions over the course of its existence. And not just sound, but also physics and graphics got big updates and it never broke any of my old mods.  Assetto Corsa is far from ready for serious modding."
simracing,3e3nb3,quffy,0,Tue Jul 21 22:26:22 2015 UTC,"AC graphics and physics updates don't break the car mods. The only thing that ever prevented car mods from running was the need to remove an obsolete section from aero.ini. This is a 30sec fix done by everyone, modder or non-modder. This fix didn't change anything about the car, it was just to remove an obsolete section that was just occupying space.  AC is far from serious modding? Stop kidding yourself.  Do these mods look like not being serious? http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/categories/assetto-corsa.1/ Does the fact that Kunos integrates some car mods and skins into the official game not make it serious enough for you? With modders getting a monetary compensation, while Kunos buys the license from the official car brand, is that not serious enough? When Kunos accquires a mod from someone, they tweak it enough on the physics, sounds, and if necessary the graphic model, to be at the game standards, or the standards required by the car manufacturer when purchasing the license. How is that not serious modding? Please get some common sense."
simracing,3e3nb3,gebbss,3,Tue Jul 21 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"There's really only two problems with mod cars. Both are easy to fix:  1) Car won't load, crashes acs.exe Solution: Go into the mod cars data folder, open aero.ini and delete the entire [Data] segment, i.e. everything up to the next line with [Something]. Save aero.ini and car should now load.    2) Sounds for car won't work Solution: More of a workaround really, but you need to switch your sfx folder found in (iirc) the main Assetto Corsa folder to an older version. You can find the files you need if you look around the forums, or alternatively here (sfx fix.zip). Basically rename the sfx folder you have now to something like sfxORIGINAL, then copy the new folder to where the old one was. I had trouble with this - I just merged the two folders when there was obviously different files in them. If you mess up as I did, one easy way to make sure you also have the old folder if you need it is to delete the folder, run a game file check through Steam -> sfx folder gets replaced with fresh one -> do the whole renaming/copy shenanigan -> done! Your car sounds should now work! All of them!"

Start with long, ominous tones (usually where a snippet of the movie story is revealed aka. the base). Show some action. Cue the ""epic choral music"" and slow-mo's (conflict is revealed) Slight pause with something insightful like THE line from the movie or quote. Speed up the camera changes like crazy and build build build BUILD to the crescendo where you drop the music.....[silence]...BRRRAAHHHHHH!!!. Last phrase or shot (""we're gonna need a bigger boat"") and roll the title.   I tried finding the perfect movie trailer to illustrate it but couldn't....because I found far too many generic ones to find a perfect one.

simracing,3e2vx3,654456,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:23:56 2015 UTC,There are rumors going around that Fanatec is working on a new wheel that will be compatible with Xbox one. Right now their only wheel that is compatible is the CSW. The Logitech G290 is a face lift of the G27 no real change other than the loss of the included shifter and increased price. The pedals did get a conical brake mod. That leaves Thrustmaster TX which is similar to the T300 with a cheaper rim and pedals that don't have a clutch. Both of which can be upgraded from Thrustmaster but that puts in the price range of the CSW once you throw in their shifter. If you stick with the Fanatec stuff your pedals and shifter should work.
simracing,3e2vx3,barney420,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:37 2015 UTC,Everyone say buy a TX and upgrade the rim. That´s way more expensive then just buying a RS or GTE from the start.
simracing,3e2vx3,654456,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:16 2015 UTC,It's seems the only wheel currently for sale is the tx for both Xbox one and pc. So unless I am missing them on the thrustmaster website you can't buy either of those.

simracing,3dwag5,TovarishGaming,4,Mon Jul 20 03:27:10 2015 UTC,"I like the post but I feel we should do a sticky with two opinions:   one from a fairly new simracer (but who has tried many sims and who has a somewhat unbiased opinion). That would be you;   and one from a more experienced simracer, maybe even two: one competitive guy, not necessarily a super fast guy, but with a performance-oriented mind, and one more casual, with a ""driving immersion""  approach  So I guess that's three opinions. But I think it would be imoortant because I believe that's why there are so many debates and general aggression regarding which sim is better on this sub. It all comes from the fact that different people look for different things. The new guy might look for variety of content, and doesn't know much about subtle ffb and physics or advanced driving techniques, he might prefer AC or pcars. The performance-oriented guy might look for the most competitive environment, the most precise ffb and physics that actually help him get faster lap times and give him a challenge, he will go on and on about iracing and maybe rf2. And the driving immersion guy doesn't care about lap times, or actual realistic ffb/physics, but about realistic-feeling ffb and physics. He'll like many of the sims, probably less so iracing and pcars.   The way you set this up, newcomers will be thankful, but the experienced guys will be ranting on why this pro or that con is stupid, because your perspective on things can change drastically over the course of your simracing journey.  And illustrating that last sentence, I'll have to critique one of your choices: people should stop praising assetto corsa's ffb. It has a great driving feel, sure, but it doesn't have great force feedback. It's better once you disable the canned effects though"
simracing,3dwag5,dospaquetes,2,Mon Jul 20 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"I don't get involved in competitive leagues or organized racing at all, and lack the perspective on what games are good for that and why. I only know from hearsay plus frustrations in trying to play casually online in games that really just don't work for it. It's why I talk so much about pub racing and factor it into the post.  I am definitely coming from a more casual and newish perspective, which is also the audience I was aiming for.   FFB is difficult. It's hard to have an objective opinion on it because it's such a subjective thing. Not only does it change depending on what you think FFB should feel like, but it also changes depending on your equipment. For example, I bet somebody with a G27 has a very different opinion of what constitutes good FFB versus somebody with a direct drive wheel.   I was honestly hesitant to even give opinions on it because of that. What I wrote down is a combination of what I think along with a bit of what I see as the general consensus factored in a bit. It's worth mentioning that I use a cheap wheel (DFGT) so my opinions are naturally leaning towards entry level hardware.  On AC specifically, I think AC tries for FFB in a bit of an unconventional way, but I think it works very well in the end and like I said, I love how it feels. I think it tells me what I need to know, albeit in a kind of heavy handed way. Meanwhile, rFactor 2 is on the totally opposite spectrum in how to do FFB and that's actually my favorite. I completely agree on turning off the canned effects though, and that applies for all games that have them.  If I was to rank the FFB, I'd say:   rFactor 2 (Super nuanced and detailed) GSCE / Assetto Corsa / iRacing (They're all close enough that I'm constantly changing the order of these three. Each has a very different approach, and I think they all fall under the same umbrella of very good.) RaceRoom (I'm most familiar with tweaking this to get it to work the way I want, but I had trouble adjusting to it and learning how to tweak it to get what I want.) Project CARS (I don't like it.)   But that's just my opinion, and people can, and have, argued till they're blue in the face about why you or I are completely and utterly wrong."
simracing,3dwag5,dospaquetes,0,Mon Jul 20 05:40:02 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been much more focused on the competitive side, but I've never tried league racing, I'm just on iracing. Anyway, concerning ffb, I've done long writeups on that front before so i'll try to keep this short.   There has been a huge change of perspective on my end when I started driving the car not empirically but by really, really listening to what the ffb tells me. Catching a slide by visually seeing how the car responds is one thing, but feeling everything through ffb allows you to remove a layer of calculations your brain has to make, you just instinctively react to ffb, which is much faster and consistent. The thing I hate about AC's ffb is that it almost feels redundant. For example, when I catch a slide in iracing or project cars, I do it almost entirely by reacting to what the ffb tells me. In AC I just catch it because they're easy to catch, and I can be pretty loose on the countersteer. The ffb isn't really telling me what is exactly happening with the car. It gives a good sense of grip, a good sense of weight, but it's not very helpful when you're at the limit. It feels a hell of a lot nicer than project cars', but it's not as good a tool for car control  I haven't played gsce/rfactor/raceroom long enough or at all to give a complete opinion, but I know AC, pcars and iracing enough to give a list going like this:  -iracing  -rfactor2  -gsce/pcars  -AC  (I haven't really played raceroom)  edit: I only replied because I feel like I have a different perspective on things and it can be helpful to some, I'm not saying you're wrong and/or trying to start a debate"

I would say iRacing is the closest to rF2, because they also go for a very light wheel so they can instead just put everything in there and let you sort it out.  Assetto Corsa and GSCE meanwhile, go for what I personally call the ""HDR"" approach, because the forces are adjusted so that you're always feeling the dominant force on the car. I can see why somebody would say the rF2 approach might be objectively better, especially if you have a really high quality wheel, but I'm not convinced enough to put it on this kind of list.  For the record, RaceRoom leans more towards the rF2/iRacing style (with canned effects that should be turned off), but it's just not as good and takes a lot of fiddling to get to how you expect.   I only replied because I feel like I have a different perspective on things and it can be helpful to some, I'm not saying you're wrong and/or trying to start a debate   Of course! That's why I replied to you as well."
simracing,3dwag5,tasygamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"iracing's ffb is pure forces calculated on the steering rack and sent directly to the wheel, the only settings you have is how high/linearly you want to scale those forces. A higher calculated force will always come out higher on your wheel, unless you're clipping of course. This is what I love about it: pure, simple, effective and realistic, and it feels great. That doesn't mean this is what makes me faster but it helps. Rf2 takes a slightly different approach and while it doesn't add (to my knowledge) canned effects, it reevaluates the strength of forces to create a ""custom"" ffb that will (to some people) feel better on lower end wheels. This is to get around the fact that to get the best ffb through direct force calculations, you need a very strong wheel, preferably direct drive. I don't find this true as I believe when it is setup right and you don't grasp the wheel too tightly, even on lower wheels the ffb will be better and more understandable when it's a direct force output free of tinkering by the sim.  Assetto corsa goes sideways from there, the ffb forces are not just the forces calculated on the steering rack, but a mix of forces acting on the whole car, plus the ""canned"" effects (canned is a big word, they are still physics-based effects, they just aren't ones you should feel through a wheel).  GSCE and Project cars actually have very similar ffb when set right. I don't know how gsce's ffb is calculated, but the problem with pcars' is actually the lack of road surface detail, which is why the ffb can feel a little dead. Also I believe on pcars the ffb is made to feel like the actual wheel would feel, whereas calculating forces on the steering rack (iracing, rfactor2) removes some dampening from the wheel assembly. (with a DD wheel iracing would actually be more responsive than the actual car's steering). The biggest problem with pcars though is not the actual ffb but the myriad of options to customise it. Since people don't appreciate this somewhat dampened (but actually very good, control-wise) ffb they try to customise it and it ends up way worse than the original.   The thing is most casual simracers are looking for feel rather than precision and assetto corsa gives them that (not many people disable the additional effects in AC). Which is why when they get into a game that doesn't shake the wheel on every smallest bump in the road, they dislike it. And I get it, AC feels great, it feels very alive and engaging, but it doesn't convey precision, So I wouldn't call that the ""hdr"" approach. Also, many people feel like a heavy wheel is the way to go, but it absolutely kills your ffb unless you have a very strong wheel. A high end wheel is not needed to enjoy rf2's or iracing's ffb (or pcars' for that matter), what is needed is different views on how ffb should feel."
simracing,3dwag5,Ctushik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:48 2015 UTC,"You're almost there with rF2. It fit's the 100% of forces within the 10% possible output in consumer grade wheels (made up maths, you get the point)  However, you have the ability to tailor this to your desires. Want a heavier wheel at low speed, no problem. Want a light wheel with heaps of feel, no problem.  I believe... and am happy to be corrected, that the only reevaluation that goes on is that it may sacrifice low speed power for high speed to keep the linearity of the feedback intact.  All fully adjustable!"
simracing,3dwag5,dospaquetes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:58:20 2015 UTC,"It's always interesting reading peoples experiences with Force Feedback, especially since they vary so much. It seems to be extremely subjective, and complicated by the almost infinite combinations of different hardware and settings.    Assetto corsa goes sideways from there, the ffb forces are not just the forces calculated on the steering rack, but a mix of forces acting on the whole car, plus the ""canned"" effects (canned is a big word, they are still physics-based effects, they just aren't ones you should feel through a wheel).   This is not accurate though. AC only sends steering rack forces to the FFB, same as rF2. It was actually a criticism against it when it was released. They finally added optional canned forces, but they are not steering rack forces, just vibration for things like kerbs and road surface bumps."
simracing,3dwag5,Ctushik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:02 2015 UTC,"It is extremely subjective, and depends on many things. What you expect from it, how you understand it, the time you spend in one sim or the other, whether you are an instinctive driver or if you mostly use what you see happening on-screen, whether you have ever experienced a correctly calibrated ffb, and even -and that one is important, hence the bold print- how tightly you hold the wheel. My perspective has changed drastically over time, from thinking AC has the ""best ffb ever"" to now not liking it  My bad about AC then, I thought I read the opposite somewhere but can't find any reliable source on how AC's ffb is calculated.

While I guess Petrobras has cars that I recognize (e.g. Lancer), it's not a series I'd ever heard of.  I'm pretty ignorant of open wheel racing, so all of the open wheel series went completely over my head. That's a fair point to add, as this is definitely not the first time I hear that GSCE has become a very good open wheel racer.  Honestly I was kind of struggling to come up with problems with GSCE. While I don't play it much, I just could not recall many glaring problems I had with the game. It's mostly nitpicky stuff that's typical of old rFactor.  I haven't played DIRT Rally, so somebody else would have to fill that one in."
simracing,3dwag5,doctaj5,4,Mon Jul 20 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"There are two basic types of open-wheelers on GSCE:  Formula Vee is an amateur racing class similar to Skip Barbers or Formula Fords. A lower-powered class that new drivers can use as a stepping stone into bigger things, or that amateurs who aren't going to go pro can get wheel-to-wheel racing in.  The others are all unlicensed Formula One cars.  Formula Classic is based on the 1980s cars (similar to the Lotus 98T in Assetto Corsa)  Formula V12 is based around the early 1990s cars, after turbochargers were banned.  Formula Extreme is based around the 2014 car.  Formula Reiza seems to be build around the 2006-2013 regulations, but I'm honestly guessing on that one.  The main cons of GSCE are that it's ""jack of all trades, master of none."" It doesn't have any glaring faults, but it doesn't have a ton of incredible pros, either. It's got AI that's good but not as good as rF2, it's got middling graphics, the force feedback is good but not great, the sounds aren't as good as some other games...  It's just not quite as good as some of the other stuff, but it's not bad in any specific area.  Or so I've heard it described.

It's a lot of why it's ended up becoming my racing sim of choice, but the crippling pay model that destroys any chance of its multiplayer growing just kills me inside, so I bounce around to other games for multiplayer action.  But I digress. The more I think about it, the more I think that's a fair point to level at GSCE. I added it, but I'm still a bit conflicted over whether that's either fair or true. It's something I think, but when people say its great for open wheelers, it makes me wonder if that's not worth something."
simracing,3dwag5,seacucumber3000,3,Mon Jul 20 06:21:38 2015 UTC,"I believe that each sim needs that one feature to separate it from the rest from a business aspect. The new sim racer has to ask ""Why choose Sim X over Sim Y?""  Like what's the first things you think of with the following sims?   AC - Nurburgring and good FFB iRacing - online racing pCars - deep career mode from karts to F1, or as they market it: ""The Ultimate Driver Journey"" R3E - Touring cars rFactor2 - best physics   And then we get to GSCE...errr...Brazilian Stock Cars?   But honesty, I really do enjoy Stock Car Extreme. The people at Reiza are very engaging with their customers at the Race Department forums (kind of their home base). In a way, the Stock Cars are kind of like Super GT cars (and nothing like the NASCAR stock cars...), and the Marcas games are the Touring cars."
simracing,3dwag5,SlowRollingBoil,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:08 2015 UTC,"Wow this is dead on.   It took me a while, but honestly, GSCE is the sim I play 90% of the time now. It feels great, looks good enough, AI is really really good, and I can even find a decent online race or two. That and the formula VEE and the stock car v8s are just a blast to drive. I still think rfactor 2 is the best true to life sim, but I just prefer to play GSCE more."

A record that you're paying monthly to keep active. It creates a stressful, ""You're doing this for real"", environment that people tend to either love or hate.  This is in contrast to SP racing games where messing up just means you hit restart. Even in MP pub races, being an idiot will make people in the race unhappy, but it has no permanent consequences."

I'd spend the single hour I have to race practicing and hoping I could be in the top half of the field. I'd qualify OK at best and then Turn 1 I'd be out or I'd have some BS spin that I thought was unrealistic.  And just like that, I'm left with a lower rating in the game, an hour of my life wasted and no more time to play games that day.

simracing,3dwag5,Gian_Doe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah if the car doesn't resonate with you it's not much fun, and the pricing is so steep that you can't just buy everything willy-nilly, you kind of have to pick and choose and commit. The test drive function helps, of course.   Right now I'm back from I hiatus so I am focusing on the Skip Barber series and I'm eyeing the GT3 cars as the next step since the Star Mazda doesn't do it for me.   As for the tracks - you don't have to buy every track. You can just buy the new tracks for that season and they will stick around for three seasons for that series."
simracing,3dwag5,foldit_,3,Tue Jul 21 07:53:39 2015 UTC,"To tie in with your iRacing comments, and I say this as a person who loves iRacing...  Some series the frustration isn't only having to work around race schedules, but some series are dead.  You can go on the forums for the less populated series you're trying to race and find out what time they usually race together, but it's still going to be very rare.  Maybe once or twice a week!  This has been one of my only frustrations, I really wanted to do Indy Road Series once I got to B license, but I also want to race more than a couple nights a week and a very small amount of people actually race it.  My other gripe is it's not easy to just get on and find a quick race, races are sometimes two hours apart.  While I love the MP aspect of iRacing exponentially more than any other sim I've tried, when it comes to the actual racing, you don't do much actual racing.  I mean unless you buy all the content and you're able to switch between all kinds of cars and tracks quickly before the next race starts - or you or someone you know is willing to shell out money to host your own room.  Even when you find a private room a lot of times it will just be one long practice session.  I miss being able to hop on GT5 and find a no aids room and do 15-20 races a night.  It seems like oval races on iRacing don't really deal with this frustration because it's so much more popular than road racing.  If you race ovals disregard the aforementioned rant."
simracing,3dwag5,dododge,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel your pain on some of the road series being dead. I look at dead-ish series that I like to race in as a treat that I get to run a few times a week. The plus side is that I've discovered new series that I absolutely love now due to their huge participation.   The GT3 series is a blast and is ALWAYS packed. Races every two hours for the Sprint series, which is really about all you can handle as the races go past an hour most of the time. Also the cars are very dissimilar in their driving styles and all have different strengths/weaknesses on each track. Makes for some exciting racing/setup development, especially if you own several of the GT3 cars.  The GT1 series also has tremendous participation this season (although I don't enjoy the cars as much as GT3), and the start times are offset by an hour from the GT3 sprint series. With the shorter length of the GT1 races (30 min), this makes it juuust possible to time it right and hop back and forth from GT1 to GT3 ad nauseam all night."
simracing,3dwag5,chimpyman,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"I race the RUF in the GT3 class because there aren't many other B license options.  I'd much rather race the Lotus 79 or Indy Road, the GT3/GT cars are comparatively sluggish and forgiving.  The racing is really tight, and the talent pool is stacked, I'm not suggesting I'm the fastest guy in GT cars.  I just don't get the same enjoyment out of the cars that I get out of the DW12, the 79 Lotus, or the FW31.  I'm looking at the series chart and there's literally 1 person registered for Indy road right now.   9 registered for the Lotus 79.  How is it with tens of thousands of members, 1 goddamn person is registered for season 3 in Indy Road and only 9 are registered in the classic Lotus series.  I just don't get it.  ::sigh::"
simracing,3dwag5,foldit_,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a bummer, man. Hopefully IndyCar road picks up a bit after the new Aston Martin craze blows over, as the Oval side (mostly the fixed series) has some pretty decent participation. I definitely don't feel that the GT3 cars are exactly ""sluggish"" myself, but I guess anything will feel that way if you compare it to the DW12 or an F1 car... I've been seriously considering hopping into some Lotus 79 races but I'm terrified of the car.  The number registered has always been a little confusing to me. I'm not sure if it means worldwide, my division, my region or what... I know for certain I've been in races where upon joining it said like 9-10 (or whatever) registered, but the race would split 3 times at the start. Does it mean how many people are actively registered in a race session?"
simracing,3dwag5,smudi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"I think it means how many people are registered for a race currently.  And yeah I mean compared to F1, even the Indy car feels heavy and sluggish relatively speaking, but it's still a great car to drive.  Just doesn't want to turn in with those tiny front tires without a bit of tuning.  Old F1 cars like the 79 and the 49 are my personal favorites because you don't have the easy paddle shift - takes high level heel toe and careful throttle control.  That's where the real fun is.  The GT3 cars are so simple, I don't think they hash out talent the same way.  The races are fun and competitive, I just find the cars relatively boring to drive.  It's all relative though, they're still fun in the big picture, but not my first choice."

simracing,3dwag5,quffy,3,Mon Jul 20 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"We're in a transitional phase as the old guard of sims is starting to be phased out (GTR2, rFactor, etc) and being replaced with a new generation (Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2, RaceRoom, etc.). For the sake of simplicity and briefness, I'll only be talking about the newer sims on the market.  While this list is limited to the games that I have played enough that I feel I can have a fair opinion on them, I believe this covers all the main modern road racing sims.   I'm not going to discount that there are older sims out there, but there's already an overwhelming amout of choice, and I think the newer games are a lot easier to get into.  Maybe it's worth creating some kind of ""See also"" type section at the bottom to briefly mention older games so that players can at least look them up."

I can't even play some of those games because at this point my driving rig has no screen and for some of them VR support can be spotty or non-existent.  Meanwhile for almost a year now you've been able to fire up LFS and put on the headset and run the entire game without ever taking it off, including switching cars and tracks and accessing online servers (though some of those things might require a bit of blind touch-typing).  Granted, I play AC more because as you say it's fantastic for just doing laps and there's a ton of mods available.  But the only part that actually works in VR is the on-track driving and even then there are missing features such as pit stops and tire setups."

When people defend AC, they just talk about AC. They don't need to say this sim and this sim is shite.

Yes they both support it, but in actuality it doesn't exist. Online is always dead. They are pretty much league only sims. Nothing against them, they're two of my all time favorites, but it's a bit disingenuous in a ""beginner's"" thread to claim that the online is not dead.   I've owned rF2 for over 2 years now and the largest pub server I've found (that wasn't locked) had at most 6 people in it."

GSCE has much less online activity than rF2, so don't put them in the same boat.  Also the public racing in rF2 and GSCE that's there is much more cleaner than for example AC.

I'm not being an asshole, I'm genuinely curious... Maybe my network settings are borked? I doubt that's the case but I remember when pCars came out I didn't see anyone online until I changed my network settings so who knows...  I try damn near nightly to hop in some public servers and all I ever see is a ghost town (bar the few semi-populated servers that are locked/passworded, which I assume are league servers).  It's not that it's ""cool"" to go around saying rF2 is dead online, it's that rF2 is dead online... Time to face the facts. If ISI doesn't get their shit together as far as promoting the game properly it's going to stay dead. It's a shame because rF2 is an absolutely top-notch sim, but I don't see the online situation getting better. It's getting left in the dust by AC, iRacing and even pCars."

If I want to race a specific car and track, odds are I'll not be able to find anything existing. I might look online to see if there is anything close, see a few people, give up and find something else to play.  If I want a night of racing, I'll find something interesting that has one or two people in it. I go in and say Hi, have a quick chat about this and that and do a few sessions.  Inevitably people come and go and good times can be had.  I did this the other night and had the most wonderful night racing with a bunch of cars I have no interest in at a track I had no interest in. I did it purely because I knew it would happen.  I wonder sometimes what this genre would be like if people were not demanding instant personal perfection but rather helping to build the very communities they are looking for!  7 nights a week (australian) I can find people to race. I cant find a big organised event sure, but I'd not expect to either with pickup racing?  I'll say this with absolute clarity however. I do not care of your skill level, experience, affiliation with any franchise. To race rF2 online when close to being at one with the car, is a highlight of my life over and over, eclipsing the adrenaline and emotion more so than my days of karting."

simracing,3dwag5,GeofferyGiraffe,4,Mon Jul 20 10:06:37 2015 UTC,"Even though rF2 is my go-to sim, I'd have to agree with the point that the multiplayer is dead.  A single server with 12 people on it is not good, especially when the competition is AC, pCars, R3E and (though this is a bit different) iRacing.  I renewed my rF2 multiplayer license and basically haven't had a race out of it. Servers have either 2 or 3 people on or are locked."
simracing,3dwag5,Satsumomo,4,Mon Jul 20 11:39:34 2015 UTC,"R3E    RaceRoom is unfortunately almost equally dead, which I hate, because I want more people to race against in it. Unless there's a dramatic shift in the game's pay model, it'll never grow into an Assetto Corsa/PCars sized community because of the horrendous content fragmentation problem.   There's a strong competitive hotlap leaderboard community, because S3S runs weekly challenges for specific car/track combinations, but that's about it.  I can get decent races on the weekends during EU prime time, but that's about it. On weeknights I can usually count the total number of players on both hands. Even though RaceRoom is my personal favorite and go to (despite its flaws), I gave it a lot of shit for its pay model because it's the source of the game's poor reputation and low player counts, especially when talking about online. It just kills me inside because Sector 3 is in the best position right now to create a game that competes with iRacing, but that's a topic for another day."

If you were a seasoned veteran who had been driving the same cars/tracks for years, I very easily can see why it would be a plus.  Just like iRacing's ""you die in the game you die in real life"", it's something that somebody will see as either a good or bad thing depending on what kind of experience you're looking for.

simracing,3dwag5,mixting,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:15 2015 UTC,"Laser scanning is definitely worth mentioning. I forgot about that and have added those notes to AC and iRacing.  For R3E, I covered the PRO with how it has a lot of licensed content. The con I think only applies to the FFB settings, and I mentioned that as well.  The iRacing frustrations I think are accounted for in the ""be prepared to rage when either you screw up and throw away an entire race, or somebody ruins yours.""  rF2 not having a Career, while I completely agree with you and think its amazing AI would make a career an awesome addition, that's very much a personal thing and not really what rFactor 2 is trying to be. I don't think ISI would ever do a career justice in the way I imagine it in my head anyway, as that's just not their thing.  I don't think rF2 is frustrating for beginners though. With the new GUI, it's surprisingly easy to get running."

As with what I said to Totality, at the very least, something similar to Championship feature in rFactor1 and I would be very happy. When I wrote Career Mode, I was probably thinking the Championship mode...  And personally, when I started sim racing, I actually went and got rF2 first (probably 2-3 years ago). It was very confusing and frustrating when I first started. We never had those tools that they do have now. I never did consider looking at forums back then like I do now.  I don't even play rF2 much (most of my time goes into iRacing in official races and league races), but even lapping the Skippy at Lime Rock for an hour made me a second quicker in the car in iRacing. I just choose iRacing over rF2 for the accessibility (tbh, I still don't think my settings are where I want them to be in rF2 lol) and the pick up online racing and all the bells and whistles that come with it."

simracing,3dwag5,_St3fan_,3,Mon Jul 20 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"I do agree with that non laser-scanned tracks doesn't mean the quality is crap. It just doesn't hurt to have laser scanned tracks.   rFactor2 was frustrating to me when I was a beginner when the UI was bad. And yes you're right all official DLC is free. Even the pay mods with the EGT and PGT are very good, as well as the DTM one.   There was a bit of a career mode (or at least a championship mode - where I think you could earn credits and what not?) in rF1 from what I remember, and I'm kind of disappointed that rF2 doesn't have it. Yeah, there are external tools to make an offline championship, but something in the official package would be better for the new sim racer in general. However, I do recall that Tim has no interest in making a championship feature.  I believe a career mode/championship mode is essential in some form for a racing sim that caters to their market. The market for rF2 includes offline and online users. At the very least, promote the tools. Not everyone likes fiddling with values you know. Remember, learning how to race is already very tough for the new sim racer. It's best not to overload information."
simracing,3dwag5,smudi,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"rFactor 2 is not frustrating for beginners.   rFactor 2 is frustrating for me and I'm no beginner. So many things are not intuitive and often lagging behind almost every other sim (wheel rotation per car, for instance).   No career mode is not a con for a serious simracer.   Bullshit. The implied ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy aside, I don't have the time for multiplayer races more often than not. My family life means I need a pause button or to exit a race without sacrificing some permanent record. Good AI races are more frequent for me than good multiplayer races, honestly, and that's how I prefer it.  A good career mode means a hell of a lot to me. It's why I'm playing Project CARS's well fleshed out career mode currently instead of Assetto Corsa's horribly tacked on career mode. I want to race in a series offline, not just hot lap."
simracing,3dwag5,arsenicfox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"wheel rotation per car   This tripped me up for a while. It does work in rFactor 2, but I had to make sure to check the ""let game override settings"" or something to that effect in my Logitech profiler. Before that, I had the same problem and was always just manually setting the steering lock. I don't know what wheel you have or if that even applies to you, but it was an unintuitive fix to a problem so many people say doesn't exist.  The same applies to RaceRoom. It has a great working soft steering lock, but only if that option is checked. Otherwise it just uses whatever the profiler is set to use."

It's more like further layers of detail added. The core attributes largely remained untouched as you'd only change the dataset if a new source of data proved the old data incorrect.  That's one of the benefits of producing physics that are as dynamic as they are in the real world, instead of applying putty to fill in the holes.  There is nothing flawed about the tyre model. You just have more data with the newer cars.  So can you race in the wet? I do not recall having any difficulties outside of being caught just past pit entry when it starts raining.  I've done full wet race, drying and all in between in a variety of old and new cars. Some experiences are better than others, but none as you describe.  You are spot on about the older content in the new demo build. They have acknowledged that as an issue and we've been informed there will be new content in the next demo.

A PC screen already blocks more of the view than a helmet ever would and the total lack of feel from a driving game should presumably make you want to grab any opportunity to increase visual feedback."
simracing,3dvrsk,gamermusclevideos,4,Mon Jul 20 06:32:44 2015 UTC,"I dont think the camera moves that much, I turned off a lot of it so there is basically only a slight 'look-to-apex' which Ive used since GTR2 (except for the period when I used triple monitors). Many cameras have way too little (or no) camera shake/movement at all, so its like driving with your head bolted to the seat. I remember when I first tried the motion cockpit view mod for iRacing, and while it took a while to get used to, it was extremely useful on particularly bumpy tracks (not that the pcars helmet camera is anywhere close to that degree of movement).   visibility is further blocked off   In this case, though,  that was kinda the point :D The helmet's visor is also slightly darker than the regular camera, and theres a slight vignette effect thats darkening the edges."

Its all a compromise and a mix of subjective prefrences for a screen, with the DK2 and HMD's though I think that fixes many issues and by its nature feels alot more like Waring a helmet."

simracing,3dug13,bimmerjim,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:43 2015 UTC,"After checking this out, it looks like it may be a cheaper solution as well as more customizable. I have an old amp sitting in my basement from a relatives passing. It's a 5.1 Pioneer amp. I believe its a 500 watt amplifier (I will check later), would I be able to use this to power 5 pucks, using the sub output to power a large transducer under the seat and the speakers for smaller pucks? I have some research to do, not sure if I limit the signal to low frequencies going into the amplifier if it will even play it back it may just send it all to the sub output and nothing to satellite speakers.  Also with the Obutto being all steel, I may need to use some intuition to find a way to mount and localize these things if I go for a set up with multiple pucks. I have a feeling each one will vibrate the whole cage if I mount them onto steel. I may need to put bushings between certain areas of the cage if possible."
simracing,3dug13,bimmerjim,2,Sun Jul 19 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"you most likely could use that amp. its a home theater amp? i have used car audio amps in the past, but they need a way to get 12 volts. you can use a 110 ac to 12v dc power adapter and wire it in, or use an old power supply from a computer. of course you want to match the RMS wattage ratting. (make sure the power supply can keep up with the amp) the transducers i have require very little power. 20w is more than enough. and yes, you should be able to power 5 independant speakers with that 5.1 amp. the transducers work just like any other speaker, the amp does not care. you can use inline filters to limit the frequency of any or all of the speakers. full range satellite and use your center channel for the kicker.  independant volume control might be an issue."

I don't see any reason I couldn't wire a volume and frequency control in series to each unit. I could just make a little box and mount it somewhere, and put a series of 5x2 knobs. Or by individual volume control, do you mean from within the software, as in getting my left, right, and center sorted out?  Also I just checked out the owners manual. I need speakers (transducers) with 8-16 ohms of resistance. I believe I would need to wire two 4ohm speakers in series to achieve this. Not sure if this would be a big power limitation for me? I'm sure they sell transducers with higher ohm, gotta look around after work. Most of the ones I found that had great reviews were 4 ohms. However if I do this I will lose my control over front and rear.   This looks like it could be a solution, but I'm not sure it will deliver what I'm looking for. http://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-hdn-8-weatherproof-sound-exciter-transducer--300-387"
simracing,3dug13,Intardnation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:43 2015 UTC,"i mean independant volume control in the sense that i have y'd off my pc audio out 3.5mm jack. one leg goes to my 2.1 pc speakers, the other leg goes to the amp and pucks on my chair. so, my master volume is controlled by the pc. the pc speakers have a volume knob on a little dongle. and the amp has a volume control. this is handy in case im playing online and using a headset, i can output audio though both headset and pc speakers/seat. turn down the 2.1 pc speakers from the dongle, and turn up the seat as to not overpower my game audio to my friends online.   that receiver will work just fine. but you will be overpowering the transducers if you get the ones i have. you want to find transducers that are rated for that amp. both in ohms and wattage, like you mentioned.   if i were you, i would use the receiver to output 5.1 in the normal way. 4 corner speakers, one center channel and y off the sub out on the receiver to signal a puck & amp setup like mine. i would do it that way if i had a a receiver like that.    if you can build a crossover, do it. crossovers and volume controls are available, iv seen plenty available retail if DIY doesnt work. what youre talking about there is beyond me.   just based on looks, i don't like the look of the transducer you linked, just because of the single coarse screw mounting. looks insufficient. these things vibrate a lot. im afraid a single mounting screw would come loose over time, or may be too deep of a screw for chair mounting. i like how my transducers mount like a speaker, in a ring. and i choose the length of screws to mount with. that way none are poking me in the back and ass.  there are a ton of these on the market, you will find what your looking for."
simracing,3dug13,bimmerjim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:22 2015 UTC,how did you wire the pucks? It is only a 2 channel amp right but 4 channels or speakers or did I miss something. Your post has me inspired to try doing this but not sure if pucks are good or going with an aura one would be better?  I would also like to see if the simvibe would be worth the money or not.
simracing,3dug13,Intardnation,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, its only a 2 channel amp. i wired it left and right, in parallel. this properly loads the amp at 4 ohms, given each transducer is 16 ohms.  google image for reference i could wire in four more pucks, but at that point i would be underdriving the pucks and overdriving the amp. its about matching your rated rms watts of the speaker/transducer/puck with the amp.  for 20 something bucks a piece, and not much more for the amp, im very happy. i have just over 100 bucks in the whole setup. they are about the cheapest i could find, and im sure better results would be had with more expensive equipment, or a larger amp. but on an office chair, its more than enough."

simracing,3dug13,davedontmind,3,Tue Jul 21 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"I'm using just one, mounted on the back of my rig (the left-to-right bar below at the back of the seat on my Obutto R3volution)  It's definitely worth it - it adds a whole new dimension. Even something simple like feeling the engine revs really adds to immersion.  More shakers would be even better. Ideally I'd like 5 - one for each corner of my rig for wheel-related forces, and one for the centre for other forces (such as gear changes, engine, etc), but I've not really had the cash available for more.   I'm using a Buttkicker Gamer 2, which currently runs at about £155 ($241) here in the UK (I'm sure it's way cheaper if you're in the US - we tend to suffer from a direct $x -> £x price conversion, which sucks). I'm sure there are more budget-friendly setups, but I've never been sure what a suitable alternative would be. On the positive side, it's a piece of cake to setup and even easier to mount.  Remember, to make the most of it you also need Sim Commander (which converts game telemetry to vibrational forces) and an additional sound card, which adds to the cost.  You can use a shaker without those, but then it'd just be vibrating to any bass sounds rather than specific events."
simracing,3dug13,frviana,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:59 2015 UTC,Good to hear as my R3v should be here towards the end of August and that's what I would be ordering it for. I was looking into the cheaper USB sound cards to run this. I have yet to figure out if there is any benefit to a higher grade card vs a cheap USB solution.
simracing,3dug13,xamomax,2,Sun Jul 19 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is that SimVibe only supports a certain set of racing games. If you'd like to use your shaker with other games (reverting to just shaking along with the bass sounds), then it requires some planning. You either need some sort of hardware switch to re-connect your shaker to your primary sound card when you play non-SimVibe games or some sort of software switch.  I use the latter - I run VoiceMeeter Banana which can copy the sound output from my primary card (the game's audio) to my secondary card (which drives my Buttkicker). So I hear the sound from my speakers, and feel the bass in my butt.  So If I play a racing sim I just run SimVibe. If I play a non-racing game and want the Buttkicker involved, I run Voicemeeter, set the Voicemeeter device as the default sound device in control panel, then run the game."
simracing,3dug13,davedontmind,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:16 2015 UTC,I have just one setup on my playseat. I wasn't very happy with the results until I added an additional sound card and added simvibe and the whole experience changed even with a single one. I really like and think it's worth but I'm sure you will in the future invest in more just I want to.
simracing,3du18c,Manuele23,8,Sun Jul 19 13:39:28 2015 UTC,Codies F1 game this year is the worst one they've ever released.
simracing,3du18c,Uzinero,2,Sun Jul 19 15:20:25 2015 UTC,I have been reading this online from other people too..... is it really that bad?
simracing,3du18c,planelander,7,Sun Jul 19 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's absolutely dreadful. In short, terrible physics, with all force feedback maxed out on T500RS the most I get some slight vibration when I go off track, have slammed into walls head on at full speed and had only my front wing come off, online is an unplayable mess, the list goes on and on. I've bought every single F1 game Codies have ever made but F1 2015 is definitely my last F1 game for the rest of the time they own the licence. Here's the full review I wrote for it on steam (will reformat slightly for reddit):  AVOID! Codies Worst F1 Game EVER!  So, I've been a long time fan of Codies F1 series. I've owned F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, so of course, it was a no brainer I would get F1 2015. Now, F1 2015, I can say without any doubt that it is the worst F1 game Codies has ever made. I haven't experienced the optimization issues some have, I'm running it at 1080p, every setting maxed and getting around 110-120 FPS (SLI 980's.) The game does look better than previous years, but is worse in just about every other way it can be.  With this game, Codies have removed the career mode. This was already known before release, but is still a huge disappointment, as the championship mode to replace it is extremely lacking. The physics and damage are absolutely abyssmal. It drives worse than any other F1 game I've ever played. I noticed how bad the damage was (This is with it on full, too.) so I drove into a wall at full speed in Australia. My front wing broke off, and the rest of the car was fine. Absolutely ridiculous. The cars handle like boats and are terrible to drive.   I use a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel. In all previous games, I've set force feedback to around 50% and it has been perfect, I could get a good amount of feedback through the wheel and it felt very realistic. Now, with the new game, I have everything in 100% and I can barely feel anything. There's a slight vibration and nothing more with everything maxed out. The car drives like a donkey and when force feedback is essentially non-existant, welp, it becomes almost impossible to drive.  Now, let's get into the fun (not really) that is online. Online is completely broken right now. I joined a lobby for a standard sprint race earlier. 5 of us in the lobbies, no races yet. Apparently I had already got 25 points whilst everyone else was at 0 (As I should have been, since there were no races completed yet.) Then I got into the race. Every car that was around me disappeared upon race start. I thought I was alone on the track, nobody showed on the track or the map, and I appeared to be all alone. Then at the end of lap 2, the fastest lap time shows, and it's the driver who started behind me. Yep. I finish the race and apparently on this empty track the other guy finished ahead of me by just over 1 second and won the race, giving me 2nd and 18 points, however, since I already started with 25 points out of nowhere, I was winning the championship by 18 points still. Oh, and I forgot to mention, from start to end of that race, my car was semi-transparent and flickering constantly, which was annoying and very distracting.  F1 has had some releases that weren't that great (Looking at you, 2014), but none that weren't enjoyable (even if it did take mods to make them as fun as they should be.), every game so far I've found to be worth what I paid for it. Every game except for this one. As a long time F1 fan and fan of racing games, I hate to have to say that this is the last time I ever buy an F1 game so long as Codemasters owns the licence for F1 games. They have completely butchered it in every way imaginable and more. Codemasters, I doubt you'll read this, but I hope you do, just so you know how much you've destroyed what was my favourite racing game series.  I do not recommend this game to anyone, and I advise you not to buy it, as you will be far better off playing literally any earlier F1 game"

simracing,3du18c,planelander,3,Sun Jul 19 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was super disappointed with PCARS. It was constantly being sold as some new 10/10 sim with amazing graphics and a huge selection of cars and tracks, paid full price for it only for it to be arcade as hell. I enjoyed Grid 1 from Codies, Grid 2 was pretty arcady, but it was still fun, Grid Autosport I never enjoyed though, only Grid game I never completed. Only played a few hours of it. It's like they wanted it to be taken seriously like a full-on sim, yet it was designed like an arcade racer, just made the game no fun in any way. Assetto Corsa has been pretty good although I've still not played it much, should probably get into it some more, and yeah, Dirt Rally is really great. Dirt Rally and F1 2015 are made by different Codemaster's studios, but it's still surprising to see how huge a difference there is in quality."

simracing,3dtoq0,digiprost,2,Sun Jul 19 10:31:08 2015 UTC,I was about to say that rear lights in AC were a big disappointment (cuz I know they are just texture img) but as I looked at the PCars video I'm confused. Are the rear lights also texture img instead of real light source?  Also I heard that the 2 games have totally different ways of handling sound when using chase camera (I heard AC was pretty bad here). Please correct me if I'm wrong. I just don't think these comparison videos and consequent discussions would lead anywhere.

simracing,3dt5a0,Netran01,5,Sun Jul 19 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"The following is all my personal opinion, not fact:  Best sounds? Raceroom Racing Experience on Steam. Absolutely phenomenal sound design by those guys. Breathtaking at times...  Best physics/FFB/Driving feel? Depends on your budget... On Steam I'd recommend Stock Car Extreme. Superb FFB and physics, but the cars and tracks are basically all pretty esoteric South American series and locations (with a few notable exceptions), although there are TONS of free mods for almost any type of content you'd like.  Assetto Corsa is another popular choice on Steam. Great graphics and good, yet polarizing physics and FFB. People seem to either love it or hate it, not much middle ground.  pCars is another biggie on Steam with excellent graphics and a pretty large userbase, although the physics and FFB are a little ""off"" when compared to the more hardcore type sims. Still tons of fun though...  If you're willing to venture off the beaten path into non-steam games and subscriptions models then I would recommend rFactor 2 or iRacing. rFactor 2 is pretty much the king of the hill as far as driving physics and FFB go, although it suffers from a relative lack of content and there's not much online action unless you join a league. The online is subscription based and it's not on Steam.  iRacing is pretty much the king of the hill as far as competitive online play goes, No other sim really even comes close to the features it offers in that regard and there are always people online to race. It's technically on Steam, but the game is web based in the first place and there's not really any advantage to buying it there... Tons of content (pretty much any major track you can think of, except for some of the newer F1 ""tilkedrome"" tracks), and tons of current, licensed racing series. Blancpain GT series, all kinds of Nascar series, IndyCar, etc... The physics and FFB have improved dramatically over the years to the point where I now think they are getting close to rFactor 2's level (although not quite there yet). Can get VERY expensive however as it is subscription based, and all of the content is sold individually.  There are a bunch of other titles out there too, feel free to inquire as I own the vast majority of them, but the one's I mentioned are pretty much the top guys out there nowadays.  Hope this helps."
simracing,3dt5a0,monsterZERO,2,Sun Jul 19 06:43:11 2015 UTC,rFactor 2 online is only subscription based if you choose so. There is also a lifetime option that doesn't have a subscription. http://rfactor.net/web/rf2/rfactor2-purchase/

The only reason I play AC now is because it allows me to drive down the laser-scanned Nordshliefe -but Sector3 announced that a laser scanned Nords is coming to R3E as well, so that might cause me to stop playing AC entirely."

simracing,3drvr0,arsenicfox,3,Sun Jul 19 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"In AC you can press Ctrl+C when you hope in race against AIs, then the car will drive on its own. You can also just start a race and then select the option ""back to pits"" from the Esc button menu. This will let AI race on their own. Wait for update v1.2 maybe at the end of July. This will bring improved AI in terms of their race performance.  Now about AC modding, it is very alive, in tracks, cars, liveries, apps, sound mods. The ease of access approach is good, you won't have to scratch your head often :)  I'd say AC is very worth for modding, the AC modding forum section is well alive in terms of discussions, creativity, and help between modders. You can also check Racedepartment downloads to see some of the mods already done, but many more are work in progress inside the AC forum. If you don't want it for modding, you can also get it for driving. The car driving simulation is great, especially with a ffb wheel, but gamepad also gives fine driving. AC+Dreampack is a good package in terms of price and quantity-quality of extra content, since it gives 10 extra cars and the laserscanned Nordschleife, endurance layout included, gp+nords. So it is good if you wanna race the GT3 or GT2/E cars."

Ghost town. Nobody online. Ever. EVER...  To get the most out of rF2 you really have to join a league. There is no pick-up racing to speak of whereas in AC you can hop in whenever and find a race.  I chalk this up to ISI's utter lack of advertising/promotion and their weird subscription model. There is almost no mention of rF2 anywhere online, it's not on steam (which pretty much ensures your game will wither away and die nowadays) and there are no current reviews anywhere to be found.  The driving experience, however is unparalleled. The physics are top notch and the FFB is sublime when set up correctly. The AI is also second to none, and mops the floor with AC's sad version, if you're into offline racing (although rF2 lacks proper offline championships)."

simracing,3drvr0,monsterZERO,2,Sat Jul 18 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"The AI in AC is definitely garbage, but I'm not sure it has the ability to stage AI only races... Maybe?  It's more than likely possible in rF2, as I know for a fact rF1 can do it (use to watch AI only races when bored at work back in the day, lol) and the core engine between the two versions is very similar. Must admit I haven't tried it in rF2 yet."
simracing,3drvr0,BoogeyVan,2,Sat Jul 18 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"Okay. Thanks. I guess that I should fork over for rF2. Sucks as a modder though. Good god, creating a mod in rF1 was a chore. It seems that the only difference is that they modified the stucture (as opposed to revamp the system to make it easier). I liked the fact that AC was looking to make things easier, but if I can't do AI-only races in the game, there's no point in it for me."

simracing,3drvr0,monsterZERO,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"You're exaggerating as there is plenty of online action depending on time and day and of greater quality than AC because of the more serious players.  Best is of course to join a league which there are plenty of  http://isiforums.net/f/forumdisplay.php/131-rFactor-2-Leagues-Private-Racing  http://race2play.com  rFactors also also allows AI during multiplayer.  There are external tools for championships such as rFactor 2 Log Analyzer which also has offline challanges, and Champ R-esult.  And here is a recent review."
simracing,3drvr0,sparrow560,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"Not exaggerating at all. It is always dead. Trust me, I try damn near every night to hop into a pub server, with no luck. The only servers that are ever populated are always locked, hence my statement that joining a league is a must. Unless there's some magical time of day when the servers are packed I just never see anyone online...  I love rF2, it's probably the best sim out, physics and FFB wise, but the online is dead. Sorry. Same problem with R3E and GSCE. Both dead as far as quick pub racing is concerned.  If you want to join a league, great. Leagues are tons of fun, and you can meet some really cool people and learn some really great stuff. Way better than pub racing (obviously) in my opinion. I run in several leagues myself (although unfortunately none in rF2 at the moment).   However... If you're looking for pick up racing at any time of the day, any day of the week, then rF2 doesn't cut it by a long shot. For that i'd recommend iRacing above all. Nothing really compares in that regard. Literally any time I feel like hopping in a race, a good CLEAN race, all I need to do is pick a popular series and it's race on. If the subscription model is a no go (which I can understand, financially) then I'd recommend AC or even (gasp!) pCars. Not a huge fan of either of those titles, but I can ALWAYS find a server that is populated and ready to go, even if the racing won't be anywhere near as clean as in iRacing (AC is much better than pCars in that regard, but neither is as good as iRacing or rF2).   edit - removed a ""Trust me..."". I hate when people preface a statement with ""Trust me"". So condescending..."
simracing,3drvr0,monsterZERO,2,Sun Jul 19 06:15:21 2015 UTC,"I just want to say, I don't think public racing in any game is any good anyway. From my experience, you join a public server - you're gonna get punted off. Simple as that. I've tried that in AC, and that's exactly what I exprienced. So I don't really understand this need to go pub racing, because most of the time it's going to be infuriating (especially on AC, because of it's popularity). I would also like to add that you don't have to join a league per say, you can just join a community that races every so often. A league is much more demanding, whereas in club races you can just sign up to a race with a bunch of guys you know and go have fun in those locked servers you always see. I made that switch a year and half ago, and haven't looked back since. I've got the next three days all lined up with events, for example (Formula Vee and V12 at Sebring, Opala 1986 at Taruma). All club races. So I'd say calling the multiplayer ""dead"" (as a whole) is a bit of an exaggeration. It is dead in public (open server, race with strangers) racing, that's true. Heck, I'm sure if someone started a small server for this subreddit in GSCE , we'll probably get a race going. But I get that this is off topic, since OP just wants to see AI races, so I'll shut up about it now."
simracing,3drvr0,monsterZERO,4,Sun Jul 19 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"Agree with pretty much everything you just said, but the ability to be able to hop into a race at any time, without having to to schedule days ahead of time ala League races or RaceDepartment club races is very important to a lot of people.  Don't get me wrong, I've raced in plenty of RD club races and league races and they are miles better than pub racing. The thing is sometimes on a random Tuesday at 8 in the evening I'll feel like some sim racing, and rF2/GSCE/R3E just aren't options at times like that. That type of pick up racing just doesn't exist with those titles. That's all I'm saying.  I agree that pub racing is a wreck fest most of the time but in fairness AC and even pCars (depending on the type of car - anything faster than GT3 cars is a disaster) are pretty good in this regard.  Although it could be argued that they're not ""really"" pub races, I think iRacing is the only sim that offers racing at any time you choose, with no intentional wreckers. Of course this comes at a cost, as it is easily the most expensive sim out there, but to me, personally, it's worth it for this very reason alone..."

You can also buy an aftermarket load cell mod for them, but it'll cost you 170$ more. But hell that doesn't end up as expensive as csr elites + CPX adapter, and you skip the 5 months waiting list"

I already paid over $200 for that game and I am starting to get sick of their prices. Either leave it as it is and remove the monthly fee or give me everything for a monthly fee. But the way it is now is confusing and stupid.
simracing,3djels,teabagZz,3,Fri Jul 17 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"Thats the biggest reason I haven't joined again. The need to buy a ton of tracks just to compete in a series is tough, and then buying new cars is even tougher. The fact that last time I re-joined, I was constantly being taken out because it was the last week of a series was pretty annoying as well."
simracing,3djels,StuBeck,6,Fri Jul 17 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"Every season is 12 weeks with 4 being drop weeks, right?  I have always raced 8 weeks of 12 and stuck with a single car and series to focus on. If you do it that way things are affordable."

The Skippies race 3 free tracks a season and have a pre determined track rotation. If you raced one year in the Skippy, you should be ready to see some Star Mazda action.

If iRacing doesn't add in new and current cars, then no one will stick around, and you'll have very few people racing very few cars. iRacing needs to open up to the Euro side of the globe, and this is doing just that.

simracing,3djels,MapleHamwich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:02:36 2015 UTC,The beauty of a service like iracing is that the races are there when I have the time. For me it's much easier than committing to a set time for a league.

simracing,3djels,tasygamer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:03 2015 UTC,At lesst dynamic tracks are in the works. For me though the lack of rain is a more serious issue.

simracing,3djels,tasygamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:44:15 2015 UTC,I'm not quite sure I follow you here.  Iracing certainly has a lot of shortcomings. It's not the best driving experience out there. The reason people like it so much is that it's the best racing experience.   Does that distinction make sense to you?
simracing,3djels,makoivis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:25:31 2015 UTC,"Sure man, I only pop in once a day, so sorry for late reply.  When talking with some exclusive iRacers, they (it used to be me) have the misconception that they are driving a full on home simulator.  The also have the belief that it is the best simulation available, where in fact is it exactly as you described. It's the best racing experience... But is it?  It's all opinion, but I've done enough in all the sims to have one.  If we are talking grid number, high profile drivers, action orientated racing then there is no debate.  If we are talking about the skill, emotion, strategy levels required then that's where I'd have to disagree.  Of course we are talking fine balances here but I'll illustrate like this.  When racing iRacing, regardless of the car, I feel like I am mastering the 'game' I am driving within the parameters because if I go over them, then there is a cliff face. The challenge is to hone your skill during the race to push the edge to it's limit.  When racing rFactor 2 I feel like it's me that's inferior to the car, not the other way around. I can push so hard, I can't believe it's possible. There is shock, adrenaline, pure focus, sweat pouring off me as I look up and see I'm only halfway through. I'm so focused that I choose to clip the kerb by 5 centimeters extra, just to help kick the rear around a little. All the micro slides are just fluid corrections and every lap is within .2 of the other... In the zone!  I'm pushing to the very limits of my abilities and there is someone ahead and someone behind.  I've not seen them for 5 laps though as the spray is too thick and I just get a glimpse of the rain lights at the slowest bends.  Lap after lap after lap, 3 of us separated by less than 2 seconds, not seeing any of them for more than a glimpse.  You finish your races shaking? I thought it was weird when it first happened in rFactor 2. Now I think it's weird when I race something that doesn't give me that.  iRacing has more players though! :)"
simracing,3djels,tasygamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"Seems like I need to give rFactor 2 in the rain a go, you've certainly sold it :)  I pretty much finish all my close races shaking.   The one thing iRacing gives that no-one else seems to be providing is a reasonable progression and a learning curve for learning how to race, moving up the ladder.   Because there are consequences to crashing out, people tend to be more careful - which means it's possible to race door-to-door with the higher-level drivers. When you follow people around, you can tell who is in control and who isn't, and whether or not you need to wait for them to make a mistake or whether you can race alongside them door-to-door for several corners in a row. It's genuinely made me a much better racer the few times a year I go out for e.g. company karting events.  Honestly I can't believe that other games don't just steal the licence/SR progression system outright, because I think it would benefit pretty much every single racing game out there."
simracing,3djels,makoivis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:44:45 2015 UTC,"I know.. It is truly something to be envious of and just one more reason why people should own all the titles they can. I cannot imagine my sim racing career without it, but I'm just having too much fun to care right now and understand that for those that do, nothing compares.  We were in the lobby talking about this the other night. The quality of driving and such. To date I've seen 3 iRacing wreckers to 0 rFactor 2 ones. Granted it was C/D class but rFactor 2 seems to have mature user base I think. Polar opposites to several experiences in another game that will remain unnamed ;)"

simracing,3djels,Quartza,3,Thu Jul 16 22:46:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I have no clue what /u/Durexman is talking about.  iRacing has arguably the best physics compared to AC/RF2.
simracing,3djels,subzero800,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:40:39 2015 UTC,It's close either way. You could argue for both and I think the very best of rf/AC have iracing beat.
simracing,3djels,makoivis,2,Fri Jul 17 10:16:33 2015 UTC,I think you're right.  You have to compare them from a car by car basis.
simracing,3dkxe4,blaknift,3,Fri Jul 17 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"I have the TX. I don't leave it turned on because I don't leave my PC turned on (because it's used only for gaming).  As you know, the problem with this is that the TX goes through its autocalibration which IMO is excessively violent, each time the PC is turned on or turned off.  The way I get around this is that I have a powerboard that has a port that only activates when enough electricity draw is being detected from another designated port on the powerboard. So I have a couple of lamps perched next to my rig so when I want to turn my wheel on I just turn those lamps on, that then activates the port that the TX is plugged into, and it turns on.  Then when I'm done I just turn the lamps off and the TX turns off.  Another way to do it is the way I used to do it where you can buy a remote control power port adapter. So you plug the TX into the adapter on your powerboard and have an RF remote that you can use to switch on or off that one port.  Or a powerboard with switches for each port on the board, if the board is within reach.  Or another alternative (and I've haven't actually tested this), is that I think from memory with the TX, even if it is plugged in to power, it won't actually turn on until it detects that it's connected to the PC via USB. So theoretically, you could actually switch it on or off by plugging/unplugging the USB connector.  But none of this answers your question, but I mention it so that you know there are options to get around the fact that the TX has no on/off button.  As far as leaving it on goes, I'm not sure. My gut feeling is that it's perfectly fine (one of the reasons I suspect they felt it didn't need an off switch). I wouldn't think there's actually anything really going on with the wheel when it's not receiving any inputs from the user or a game.  So I'd say that it would be fine; but see above for various options to make turning it on/off at will with more ease than Thrustmaster gives you out of the box."

I think this depends on the type of USB plug that is in the PC but I know unplug my wheel when I am done using my PC.    So you might want to leave your TX plugged in and put your machine to sleep and see if you can hear/feel the fans on the wheel are still on. You can then try a different USB plug on the PC, unplug it or leave it plugged in. I just didn't want the fans running 24/7 on my PC."

My complaints were that using Allen keys for adjustments points was a pain and that the vertical adjustment was a little short but both seem to be fixed with the xl20d. I have since upgraded to a obutto ozone simply because I outgrew it. Triple monitors will do that.

simracing,3di4qk,Mister_Akuma,8,Thu Jul 16 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I have always viewed RRE as a sort of iRacing competitor, as they offer online play only (you can play against AI but you still need to be online). If you analyze what other products are out there, I think they are better off going against iRacing than rFactor or AC   The first part I don't really agree with. Just because you need to be connected to the internet in the same way you need to be connected to Steam to play Half-Life, doesn't mean it's an online game that's competition for iRacing.  The second point however, I do agree with. Of all the sims out there, I think R3E has the best chance of being adapted into a true iRacing competitor. They have a lot of the infrastructure already in place, and experience with running a lot of the online-focused back end that powers the game. It's something this genre desperately needs. iRacing runs completely unopposed in the pick up and play multiplayer department. Nobody has even tried to run a similar service, and I think that's something that holds the genre as a whole back.  Similar to the World of Tanks situation years ago, iRacing gets away with a lot of BS simply because they have no competition. iRacing needs a War Thunder to their World of Tanks.  But the problem is, I don't know how they can do it beyond a fundamental and massive shift in the way R3E works. This is something that the developers need to make a conscious effort in. Big changes need to happen to the game. It can't be a half-hearted adjustment either like just adding a subscription to the game, which by the way, I don't think is the right answer regardless. I don't want them to be like iRacing. I want them to be better than iRacing.  I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately. RaceRoom is my favorite and go to sim at the moment, and it just kills me inside knowing that the reason the game is so held back, and its online lobbies so empty, is because of the antiquated, obtuse, and opaque pay model that drives the game. It's where R3E's bad reputation come from, and it's the root cause for why its online is so dead. You cannot have a thriving online population these days when your pay model fragments the community in such a way that you are never guaranteed that two people have the same content.  I don't have a solution. Not one that doesn't begin with, ""You start by throwing away the entire current structure of RaceRoom and start over."" The pay model is so integral to how RaceRoom operates, and so fundamentally the cause of all of its problems, that to change it would require modifying the game to the point where it might be worth just starting over with new game instead. You can't half-ass this. Perhaps it would be best to keep this new game small and run it concurrently with R3E and sharing assets between the two. Turn R3E into a primarily singleplayer game, while this hypothetical new game is the multiplayer component.  I came across a very interesting idea for how Sector 3 could create a brand new online focused game to compete with iRacing. While I think the specifics absolutely need tweaking, It's an outline for a game that I would have no qualms whatsoever in playing, paying for, and jumping into.  It's exactly the kind of radical shake up that the genre needs, and exactly the kind of game that Sector 3 could realistically put together in a relatively short amount of time.  Simracing is incredibly outdated in the multiplayer department. It's rife with practices that were seen as acceptable a decade ago, but have long since fallen by the wayside for more interactive and community driven systems. I want simracing to be as good as it should be, and Sector 3 is in the best position right now to push the genre forward.  They just need to commit.    Thanks for starting this thread by the way. I think it's a very interesting topic worth discussing.  Although, the unfortunate title will probably have people downvoting and ignoring it. Plus, the fact that RaceRoom isn't that big to begin with. I disagreed with your title as soon as I saw it, but ended up upvoting it in the end because it's good discussion, the heart of which was the content fragmentation that's resulting in low online player numbers. Either way, I consider this thread a rehearsal for a thread I'm planning on making over on the S3 forums."
simracing,3di4qk,Why485,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Fragmentation certainly has hurt R3E a lot, and as time passes its going to get worse, no one can expect to find populated servers like this, and at the end of the day, multiplayer becomes non-existent.  R3E has to decide what it want's to be IMHO, the market has very differentiated products, and I think its in the best place to challenge iRacing, with, as you say, some heavy changes (a system like iRating and SR to begin with, that only makes sense when you have a sizable comunity)  Regarding the title: When I started writing this I was thinking that they should just replace the pay model, but I reworked the idea to reflect that both business models could co-exist, but I didn't realize that I didn't edit the title, and I can't change it now... I'm getting downvoted a lot, but I really don't know if its because of the title or the idea"
simracing,3di4qk,Why485,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"R3E has to decide what it want's to be IMHO   This is critical, really. I don't know what Sector 3's plans are for RaceRoom and that's what my thread was going to be titled. The game doesn't have a focus. It's a competent singleplayer racer and works very well online when there's players, but its pay model is in direct confrontation with developing any kind of online community.  Because of the ""free to play"" label on Steam, I went into RaceRoom expecting War Thunder with race cars, but that's not at all what the game is. That free to play label is a whole topic in itself, but either way my point is that I don't know what RaceRoom is supposed to be. It definitely has more multiplayer features than your average racing sim, especially when you take into account the online back end driving the whole game, but they don't really do anything with all of that. It's just kind of there."
simracing,3di4qk,joshr03,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think they should go a similar route to rf2. Pay once for all the content, and maybe a yearly price for online access to their dedicated servers with the ability to ""spawn"" dedicated servers for private groups/leagues. I agree that their current model is absolutely fragmenting the community to a ridiculous degree. It's got excellent features underneath it all though."
simracing,3di4qk,russlar,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:23 2015 UTC,"I think a monthly subscription would cause the people who only play infrequently drop it completely. sure, it would be better for the people who use raceroom as their main sim, but I think it would do more harm than good.  which isn't to say that you raise a good point about the f2p model. at this point, enough new tracks have been added that the track packs should get a revisit, so that new players can get the content easily. the only other change to S3's pricing structure I'd like to see is an end to charging for different liveries."
simracing,3di4qk,654456,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"One of the main ""problems"" is that there is too much content, and too many possible combinations, so besides the Experiences, its difficult to have coincidences on cars and tracks to be able to play in a server, much less a complete season. With a subscription model, you eradicate that, everyone has everything, so anyone can join any server, and it would become easier to find a race to participate at any given time.  Unfortunately I can't edit the title of my post, because it seems that I mean to replace completely the f2p model with a subscription one, when I intended to say that it should be complemented with one. That way, people would not drop it completely."

simracing,3di4qk,MapleHamwich,2,Tue Jul 21 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"Personally I dispise subscription based models. I also think it doesn't match with Sector3's philosphy, which is to make it easy for those with a mild interest in sim racing to give it a try by offering a sample of content for free. A subscription model would position it more as catering to the hard core crowd. I think what they are doing right now, with their integration of streaming races to social media is a great way to attract interest. Also once they have a full set of WTCC circuits they can use that as a unique selling point. Having said that, I wouldn't mind a subscription model existing beside the current available options. I have bought most content already but I'd have no issues with others getting access to all content with a monthly fee. The more money sector3 can pull in the better this sim is going to get."
simracing,3di4qk,fathed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:44 2015 UTC,"They could keep the current free stuff free, and just make the rest subscription."

simracing,3di4qk,basilikum,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"I think that would work well.  There would be a schism with current players, but in the long term it would probably serve them well.  If they stick with the buy to play model they have now, they really need to rethink what they're doing.    First and foremost: Their sales are fake sales.  If you look at pricing their %'s for their price reduction make no sense at all.  An 80% sale is more like a 30% sale.  There's fuckery going on there and that's not good.    Second: They need to figure out their content obsolescence plan.  Releasing new versions of racing series each year bites your customer base in the ass each year.  And having this weird cross-""experience"" fuckery doesn't help either.  If I own a GTR3 car that is also in the ADAC 2014 lineup, I shouldn't have to buy it again for the ADAC 2014 races.  That's more fuckery a customer doesn't want to have to deal with.    Thirdly: They need to sort out what they want R3E to be.  It's in a weird spot right now where it seems like they want it to be an online racer, but they're missing race simulation features and their lobbies are almost always empty (at least for North Americans.).   All of those things bug me everytime I go to boot up R3E.  During their big free weekend I considered buying more content, but I was immediately turned off by the discounts that said they were bigger than they actually were.  Then I got pissed thinking about how I would have been buying duplicates of some things I already owned.  Then I thought, why would I spend money on this anyway, it's just going to be used for offline racing and I already have rFactor 2 and AC for that."

What I think is really bad is that it lacks any creative game play modes for those casual players https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKePeKX8Gx0 .  I think if they sold this game for £15-£24 new then that would be fine, aside from some issues graphics mostly look nice. The track models are nice and I can see how it could be fun to ""drive around with the real drivers""   Whats not excusable are the lack of basic menu options and constant crashing on PC, I think the introduction of the steam refund will probably result in them delaying future PC launches unless its actually stable for most people.   Thing is I know the talent that goes into these games and I bet you the dev team was pushed with unpaid hours and will have likely put loads of sweet and blood into this, I can only assume it was a management or contractual issue that forced it out in the state that it is in."
simracing,3de2j0,teabagZz,3,Wed Jul 15 16:09:36 2015 UTC,Some people said another studio did this game but they shared the tech. I have no idea how true that is and I frankly don't care. That game is a pile of garbage and luckily they know that. Let's just hope they clean it up.
simracing,3de2j0,rancer890,0,Wed Jul 15 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure about that...  Like Codies is basically printing money with this game. And the simple reason is because there's no competition as the official F1 video game product. This monopoly means they don't really need to improve much other than graphics. They could, but they don't really have the incentive to...unless it hurts the bottom line. (same thing with all the other gaming monopoly deals out there eg. Madden)"

I've tried a few that you mentioned, just interested on people's perspective on what the best options are currently. I mainly race AI due to being in an Australian time-zone and would like something that has a decent challenge and a proper championship mode with real tracks, and preferably differing performance with different cars (no league mode stuff).  I'm entirely open to mods (I have pretty much all the major sims), and I'm really interested in historical F1 cars as well, no matter the decade."
simracing,3de2j0,CRAZEDDUCKling,8,Wed Jul 15 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"There's countless mods for rFactor, but I'd say that Game Stock Car is the most complete F1 package (in that it has 5 F1 eras out of the box)."
simracing,3de2j0,ceeker,5,Wed Jul 15 17:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of the stuff for rFactor is of middling quality, unfortunately. The GP1979 mod was very good though and I could recommend that to others.    Game Stock Car is also excellent...the handling is top notch and probably my favourite...but it's hurt a little bit by not having variety within the same classes of car (ie. they all perform the same and are the same model with different skins) and it's missing historic tracks, with the obvious focus on Brazilian tracks. That's fine, and I enjoy firing it up for some hot laps or a quick race, but it doesn't really scratch the full itch. Unless someone knows of some decent mods for it that focus on individual F1 seasons?"

simracing,3de2j0,squarl,3,Thu Jul 16 02:57:03 2015 UTC,Wait so I'm a little confused. The only F1 game I have played was 2013 and if I remember correctly you start a career as a rookie driver for one of the lower teams like toro rosso and work your way up by beating your partner and placing well then you slowly get offers from better teams like Williams then to a top team like redbull of Ferrari.  This was basically my favorite part of the game and the mechanic was one of the only reasons I played games like Formula 1 and MotoGP.  So your telling me the soul mechanic that made this game good they have taken out? so they took two steps back for no good reason?  Thanks for the review and saving me a couple of bucks. I'll pass...
simracing,3de2j0,Teslatic,4,Thu Jul 16 05:27:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I don't get, the one thing these F1 games have over simulators is the whole single player ""experance"" without that or some sort of really well done multiplayer there is no real reason to play them over the games with better handling cars.

Their recent efforts like Grid: Autosport (the entire grid franchise really), Dirt 2/3, F1 2010> etc have been absolute rubbish.  They have some pretty graphics, although the car interiors in autosport are worse than a noob modder in rF1 but their physics and options have not evolved and are garbage. It's like they roll out the same options, menu items for all of their games and they are very console focussed but even for consoles it's poor.

In fact, that amount of detail allows you to tailor the car handling exactly like you want and not have a slider between ""more oversteer"" and ""more understeer"" without you knowing what exactly it changes."
simracing,3dgfer,FromBeyond,3,Thu Jul 16 07:03:00 2015 UTC,I have no idea what the situation is like for the original Rfactor but the lack of tooltips for the setup options was a bit of a bummer in Rf2.

simracing,3dgfer,KapetanDugePlovidbe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:55:07 2015 UTC,"It's basically the same in every sim (every sim simulates cars), so once you learn what certain settings do in one sim, you will be able to make adjustments in any other sim out there."

If you haven't been following, the Super V8, Mitsubishi Lancer Cup, modern Montreal, and Velo Citta track have already been confirmed for existing GSCE players, but only those who are in the crowdfunding will get early access. I think if the community can help crowdfund a bit more (I might go up a tier XD), the 2000s F1 car and the Copa Montana (think V8 Utes) should follow.

simracing,3defkj,joshr03,3,Thu Jul 16 03:02:32 2015 UTC,"The back section of the track is the main difference (the historic layout has a very fast sweeping ""s"", and a very fast entrance to the main straight, the current version has a straight and the chicane at the wall of champions). In addition, i think the tight right hander before the back straight is also different (narrower exit, and has a shorter run to it, it was moved to generate more escape zone).

I actually believe it was an answer to a comment on the funding page and it's that specific answer that I got me to pitch in right away.  Basically after the next update of the new montreal and V8 their plans were done with GSCE.   The crowdfunding is for everything else that they mentioned on the crowdfunding page. Should they not meet the goal, they will keep the money, uphold their promises to those who had gains (beta access, voting rights, key for version of the game). The % amount of $ that they receive will dictate out of the list of stuff that they want to add what it is that they can actually add. 100% reached = add everything mentioned....50% reached through voting and estimates they'll add as much as possible from that list...75% they'll add even more...."

simracing,3defkj,Cheesenium,2,Thu Jul 16 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Curious how you think it was a crowdfunding campaign done poorly and some thoughts on how it could have gone better.  It seems to have done about as well as I would have expected so far.  GSCE is a really niche sim even in the sim realm.  By that I just mean it seems like few have the game.  So to get a bunch of money via public funding seemed like a pipe dream.  Perhaps 80k isnt very much, and that would only take about 1,000 people to donate money, but even so, Im not sure.  It was pretty clear too that this funding was for the continued release of content for GSCE while Reiza starts to move on from it and work on their next projects.  While all of the updates this crowdfunding produces are going to be free too.  So Im sure plenty of people realize this, and dont feel like shelling out $50 for something that will come for free.  Im not saying this is right, or I condone this mindset, but it is a bit of my perception on the topic.  The neat thing about this campaign though, for me, is that if you spend $50+, you can choose to get a key for their next game once it is finished.  Easy way to support Reiza now, and get a new game out of them a year or more down the road.  I think GSCE is great and wish they would reach their goal, but Im skeptical.  Hopefully Reiza can still be encouraged by the hardcore support they have and this continues to motivate them moving forward.  :)"
simracing,3defkj,smudi,2,Thu Jul 16 05:12:51 2015 UTC,"I had backed more than a dozen of crowd funding games so I know which one is good or bad. Generally, bad crowd fundings are the ones that rarely communicates with the backers or generally posts little updates. 6 updates in 20 days are awfully little where I had been on crowd funding that has daily updates.  Reiza is literally ticking all the boxes of an awful crowd funding. If they did it well, the game would had fully funded easily by now. $78,000 with a proven studio like Reiza, I dont see why they cant fully fund their goals.   Good crowd fundings frequently communicate with fans on the crowd funding site, not having it's communications tucked inside a subforum in Race Department. At the same time, frequently posts gameplay videos, like how the V8 videos or the flat spotting video bring a spike in crowd funding.   The V8s should be largely done by now, so they can spam the media with numerous gameplay videos of their V8s, considering there are 5 cars or show off more of their new WIP tracks. Heck, even a race with new V8s will be appealing to a lot of people. Maybe some videos on the Lancer Cup would be nice too, it doesnt have to polished, it just need to appear on media so various sites can pick them up. If they want to go further, they could show off a screenshot or 2 of their next game, people will go crazy over it and throw them money.   The mainstream media coverage of Reiza's crowd funding are awful where very little sites had covered it so far. It felt like Reiza did not put in enough effort to advertise the game. Especially during the considerably amount of issues surrounding F1 2015, I think Reiza could had used this opportunity to advertise their game because Reiza does one of the best open wheels among many racing games. This is coming from someone who hates open wheels in a lot of games but I do enjoy Reiza's one in GSCE.  I think, it will be a good idea to run a Steam Weekend sale with 33% off for their existing games and advertise on the front page of Steam, that will bring a lot of eyes on the crowd funding of new content for GSCE.   Also, another mistake that Reiza did is, they literally announced all the stretch goals of the crowd funding on day it which killed the suspense of the rest of the crowdfunding. I know there are backers that dislike crowd fundings that announces everything from day 1.  The price is a little bit steep but I dont think it is the major barrier. $50 that includes beta access for the current and the new game is pretty attractive.   Lastly, I think choosing Indiegogo is a bad idea where I think Reiza should had gone for Kickstarter because kickstarter has much better publicity and far more users are on that site than Indiegogo. People are more likely to back projects on kickstarters because they had used the service in the past. No doubt that Kickstarter does not give you a cent once you failed to reach the goal, the extra publicity and larger user base will definitely help. I had seen a few promising games failed because they launched their crowd funding on Indiegogo. IMO, i think a 60 days campaign on Kickstarter will defintiely fund this game easily.  I had backed even more niche games and they managed to succeed with much higher goals, I fail see why Reiza could not achieve their goals. When you have various quality racing games selling well, I do not think why Reiza could not succeed in this crowd funding. It just need more people to know about the crowd funding."
simracing,3defkj,Cheesenium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:16:59 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty damn good comment.  Very informative, thanks.  I suppose some of my thoughts about the success or failure, are nothing more than opinions with no backing.  I'm not a fan of crowdfunding really, so I have no idea what a successful or poorly done campaign looks like.  You make some very good points on how they could have been showing off more of the content they already had been working on that is near completion, but, to their fault perhaps, they didnt.  Maybe they wanted to get a big portion of their goal funded and then drop the teaser vids as a little reward for getting them to certain %'s.  Idk.  The strategy and communication of the whole campaign is a bit lacking.  Going to RD to get many of the questions answered is a bit of a drag, but that is their home base, so to speak.  Since they dont have a forum of their own like Kunos, Sector3, or SMS have.  I do think they are wholly deserving of receiving some more money, as their work speaks for itself.  Looking at the numbers though, with only ~500 backers right now...  That is quite small.  While the sim community is fairly small, 500 users isnt even close to being a relevant fraction it's so tiny.  It would be interesting to see how they would fare if they did things differently, but yeah, maybe word of mouth for this whole campaign wasnt the best way to get information out.  =/  Cheers"
simracing,3defkj,smudi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"Reiza's crowd funding is one of the campaigns that baffles me a lot. Reiza isnt some 3 man studio with a pile of concept art work, they had proven themselves again and again with 2 delivered and fully playable game where I think they have a lot to show. Even if it is WIP, it does not matter.  IMO, crowd funding is a great way to obtain funds for additional work but it depends on the developer too because I had backed projects that are all fancy PR with tonnes of promises. Then, delivered absolutely nothing so far other than a tiny sandbox to play against some wave based enemies after more than 2 years. On the other hand, I had played many games that will not happen if crowd funding did not exist.   Reiza do not need their own forums, they could have post on the comments section on Indiegogo.   When you have AC selling 200,000+ copies, pCARS sold more than a million or R3E is experiencing increase in revenue month to month since September last year, 500 is pathetically little for Reiza's crowd funding. Coming from someone who is extremely frustrated with Kunos and SMS's PR, I am very surprised that somehow Reiza's PR with their crowd funding somehow fall flat on it's face. Reiza had been doing some quite decent PR all these while, like how they handled the transition from G-Sync to Steam or their updates on new free content. I dont know what happened that they perform badly with their crowdfunding.   At the end, it just adds to my frustration to see this crowd funding did not reach it's goal."
simracing,3defkj,Cheesenium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:33:47 2015 UTC,"Curious how you think it was a crowdfunding campaign done poorly and some thoughts on how it could have gone better.   The major problem is that there is not much in for the buyer, the $35 only gives you a copy of a game that you could buy elsewhere for cheaper and dev-forum/beta-access, as the DLC itself will be free anyway. You have to pay $100 for a sticker, $150 for a shirt and $500 for a poster, that's a little steep. Some in-game random silliness like a special bonus-car/livery with all the backers name on it or something like that might have been a good idea. Or how about selling advertisement space on the game tracks?  They should also have done proper stretch goals. At the moment it's $78'000 for the whole thing and something less when they don't reach it, but they don't tell you how much less. They should have gone $10'000 for Montreal, $20'000 for V8, $30'000 ... etc. Not only would there be a better understanding of what you would get, being close to a stretch goal is a great motivator for people to pay more.

simracing,3dfz4w,necrolust,2,Thu Jul 16 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"You can probably find the most of the calendar, but the chances are that the AI won't be able to drive it and there will be no point to race them there Yes I don't think nothing will enforce you to change tyres to a different compound, but not sure about the no refueling rule. The tyre wear is likely realistic. Someone mentioned talent files in GSCE not long ago and asked if he could change them, but so far nobody replied. You can't make a custom championship just yet, and even if you could, there's no point since the game doesn't track points. You have to spreadsheet it."

simracing,3dfz4w,nomnamless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"rFactor had a full course yellow feature. As for penalties, only speeding and cut course penalties. Nothing like the ""Caused collision"" penalties from F1 2015."
simracing,3dfyep,PleaseBanShen,7,Wed Jul 15 23:34:03 2015 UTC,do you mean cross play between windows and console players?  none have been announced so far that i'm aware of.  pretty much every pc sim (unless you count Project CARS or F1 2015) isn't available on console.
simracing,3dfyep,djfil007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:13 2015 UTC,Yes it's what I mean
simracing,3dfyep,SlowRollingBoil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:00:29 2015 UTC,Assetto Corsa is going console.
simracing,3dfyep,djfil007,2,Thu Jul 16 15:32:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, sometime next year.  Don't recall if they mention cross play possibility."

simracing,3dfyep,3lfk1ng,3,Thu Jul 16 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"I have been using Win10 for 3 months.   Assetto Corsa, rFactor2, iRacing, DIRT Rally, and Project CARS all work.  There is no cross-compatibility issues to speak of."
simracing,3dfyep,quffy,2,Wed Jul 15 23:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, it is the same OS base, so to speak, Windows operating system. You can even play on windows xp if the game has compatibility on that system, then so the servers will work.   Since windows 10 is still Windows OS, there's no worries about online play.   I think with Assetto Corsa you can host a server on Linux, but you need to be on Windows platform to connect to the server as a player and race there."
simracing,3dfyep,Marklar_RR,2,Thu Jul 16 00:53:46 2015 UTC,You both understand what PleaseBanShen was asking about? Don't you? :).

As small as simracing is it would be nice to be able to mix the pc and console guys together. Though I doubt we will really see it, as Sony vs. Microsoft will never allow them to mixed."
simracing,3dfyep,faz712,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:05:44 2015 UTC,Everything that works on 8.1 works on 10. Has been the case for... Almost ever.   Unless you mean win 10 on pc and Xbox playing together then I dunno
simracing,3dfyep,Marklar_RR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:49:52 2015 UTC,I hope Assetto Corsa will have cross platform servers when Kunos release it for PS4. You don't even need Windows 10 to do it. War Thunder has cross platform servers since 2013.

simracing,3dfipb,the_real_me_is_here,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:50 2015 UTC,im also interested. it looks like the buttons plug into the wheel with a stamdard ps/2 interface. perhaps someone out there knows the pin outs?
simracing,3dfipb,blaknift,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:49:18 2015 UTC,"You would use an SLI board, mounted to the wheel, to serve as the main display and button controller.  A coiled USB cord, loosely wrapped around the column, would be the electrical connection to the base.  There have been some commercial paddle shifters available like this and this.  IMO you pay too much and should think about the DIY approach.  It's really just giant switch.  See the other paddle shifter for example.  Magnets provide the return action.  It's a fun project, I could brainstorm more with you but gota run for now."
simracing,3dfipb,Quartza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much! That last link is exactly the kind of thing I've been looking for; a detailed view of the rear of the button plate and paddles.   I think i'd rather use an interface without SLI as I plan on making the jump to VR in time and wouldn't really need it. I'm hoping to do it as cheap as possible without comprising quality and of course it'll give me a project to work on over the summer so the all DIY approach would be best.   No problem, hope to hear from you again."
simracing,3dfipb,Quartza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"Plans got changed, staying seated.  You would just replace the SLI with this http://www.derekspearedesigns.com/32-button-no-matrix-controller.html  You can go smaller on the board form factor for more $$$ or more DIY(arduino programing)  *Another cheap option if you wanted just simple push buttons(no rotary encoders ect) http://www.amazon.com/Reyann-Arcade-Encoder-Joystick-Fighting/dp/B00UUROWWK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437013941&sr=8-1&keywords=joystick+usb+board"
simracing,3dfipb,Quartza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yeh, the DSD one looks perfect, no need for me to learn soldering and a lot of the stuff is cheaper than I though. Still though the only thing that I'm can't seem to grip is where to put all the wiring and the pcb onece attached to the wheel plate. I'm really keen to see what others have done here? Do I just leave everything exposed? And whats the best material to use for the button plate, I see DSD cheap ABS plates but I'm not sure how I'd connect paddles to this, surely it wouldn't be strong enough? Thanks again."
simracing,3dfipb,FromBeyond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:07:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured it would be much easier with the mini pcb version, downside being the increase price.  The mini version and wiring could easily hidden on the back side of button plate.  The paddle bases could attach to metal of wheel.  Would prefer some kind of composite over the ABS material."
simracing,3dfp9q,Linsolv,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:23:32 2015 UTC,One possibility is that with the load cell you are not pressing the brake as hard and then giving you to much front grip when you try turning in resulting in a spin. Other then that they do take some time to get used to so patience will pay off
simracing,3dfp9q,True_Racer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:45:13 2015 UTC,Throwing manual into the mix is tricky if you've never sim raced manual before. Have you driven manual cars? The spinning could be down to over revving while switching gears which causes the tires to spin and kick. Try letting your revs drop a but before letting the clutch out and getting in the gas again.   Congrats on the new pedals btw. I have the club sport v3 on pre order. Cannot wait
simracing,3dfp9q,MGAV89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:22 2015 UTC,I had a manual VW Jetta 2.slo. It served me well until its electronics got completely fried in a freak accident. But obviously it wasn't sequential and I was driving it reasonably.
simracing,3dfp9q,654456,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:03 2015 UTC,When you configured the pedals did you press as hard as you could or just as hard as you are comfortable?
simracing,3dfp9q,654456,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"I just race at my desk for now, and I was pressing on the pedals so hard that I had to hold on to the desk not to push myself away."
simracing,3dfp9q,PleaseBanShen,2,Wed Jul 15 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"That would be why, you don't want to calibrate it to it's max but to your max. You are spinning because you can't apply enough braking force during a race with it set like that."

simracing,3dd0da,MGAV89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:40:47 2015 UTC,"Summit racing has a line of private label seats, which is what I got. ~$160. Cheaper than others bc its vynyl, heavier, not such great bolstering etc. for g-forces. It would make a bad race seat but it is good for sim racing.  I dont think actual racing seats are a very good choice, they are designed for certain constraints we dont face.  edit: http://www.summitracing.com/parts/sum-g1159-2"
