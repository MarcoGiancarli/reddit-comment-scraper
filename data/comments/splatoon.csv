splatoon,3e2v2a,Iamdarb,3,Tue Jul 21 18:41:13 2015 UTC,I went through 50 rolls yesterday and didn't get a single instance of 3 of the same sub. Is there some kind of secret to this shit?
splatoon,3e2v2a,Litagano,7,Tue Jul 21 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't quite get the big deal of having 3 matching subs.  Sure, it looks cool and impressive, but it's not like it changes anything versus having a total of 3 of the same subs between all your combined equipped gear.  Personally I've been using my shells and cash to add slots to as much gear as a I can rather than rerolling.  I've already got some 3 matches on gear just by chance so far, once I get everything with full slots I guess I'll start doing some re-rolls."
splatoon,3e2v2a,blaknwhitejungl,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:55 2015 UTC,"For me, it's because I prefer having three of the same sub slots that have a noticeable effects, rather than a mish-mosh of random perks that don't add up to anything noticeable."
splatoon,3e2v2a,Whelt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:49 2015 UTC,I think he means that it's still possible to have three full sub abilities spread across your gear. Realistically it's all preferential.
splatoon,3e2v2a,Always_Irrelephant,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Ah.  That's a good point, but in that case, what /u/Whelt says is true as well. It's better to have it on one piece of gear so you don't have to depend on other pieces to get the full effect."
splatoon,3e2v2a,Nas160,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:26 2015 UTC,He was saying that 3 subs across your equipment have the same effect as 3 subs on 1 piece of equipment.
splatoon,3e2v2a,SFaustus,6,Tue Jul 21 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"It just creates a nice, specialized piece of gear that doesn't have to rely on subs from other gear to be complete. It's not absolutely essential, but if you can get it, then why not.  I happened to roll two Ink Saver Main and one Ink Recovery Up on my Octoling armor, which is incredibly lucky because Cuttlegear has no sub ability specialty. I don't think I'm ever going to reroll it and try for anything better."
splatoon,3e2v2a,BazonkaDog3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:12 2015 UTC,It helps you swap between gear and create sets easier if all you equipment has the same 3 sub abilities
splatoon,3e2v2a,hiddenjumprope,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people want triple sub abilities. What about the whole diminishing values thing...?
splatoon,3e2v2a,Theworstmaker,2,Tue Jul 21 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"The diminishing returns aren't really so steep, and without stacking the abilities don't do quite enough on their own to make a big difference."

splatoon,3e0b33,AtaMori,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:42 2015 UTC,I was also wondering if Jump n' Spray increased its distance because of the lack of clipping.
splatoon,3e0b33,blacktieaffair,27,Tue Jul 21 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"I was playing a match last night were a good Dynamo Roller, who was adept at jump->flick->dive->repeat was tearing up the match no matter what team he was on.  The weapon is really overpowered.    It doesn't matter how long it takes to charge up a flick, because if someone knows what they're doing, they've flicked you before you can get the second of third shot to get the kill.  And since it is a stupid one-hit instant kill, you're done.  Add that to the instant ability to kill with the roller, and the ""long"" charge time and ""bad"" maneuverability doesn't matter at all.  Not to even mention that it spreads ink like a mother-f too.  I've been locked up by a good charger rifle player before, but that doesn't bother me because you can't really actively be blocking a choke point AND inking tons of turf at the same time.  The Dynamo Roller can be inking up a storm while waiting for you to respawn."
splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,12,Tue Jul 21 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to test these results to see the effective kill range of the dynamo. This chart shows maximum range, not effective range."
splatoon,3e0b33,robotoboy20,5,Tue Jul 21 02:18:44 2015 UTC,Right? Sometimes the area you paint is drastically bigger than your hit range. Needs to be overplayed on the chart.
splatoon,3e0b33,bart64,4,Tue Jul 21 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"I have done this, and I even have crappy cellphone pictures of my tests. The 1 shot kill still out ranges a lot of shooters. I can edit them in when I'm home, but I'm at work right now."
splatoon,3e0b33,skabadelic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:48 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'd like to see.  The Aerospray can shoot as far as it says on the chart but you're not killing anything at that range with any sort of consistency.
splatoon,3e0b33,BladeJager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:00 2015 UTC,"The Spray's biggest enemy is its spread, the further you are, the less shots hit. Take Nozzlenose or Squelncher, and no matter how far or close, you're getting your kills if they're in range."

splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,4,Tue Jul 21 12:36:20 2015 UTC,"IMO at least, rollers would have much better balance if the flick attack didn't kill you in one hit. I'm fine with them being able to insta-kill by walking over me, but dammit, why give them a ranged move that does that too?"
splatoon,3e0b33,SomeonesYiffAlt,6,Tue Jul 21 08:52:46 2015 UTC,They could be balanced a bit if they disallowed jumping and flicking at the same time. I do wonder if this charts adds the distance of a jump-flick.

splatoon,3e0b33,Carighan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:46 2015 UTC,"Despite the crappier range, due to the aoe on a gun type weapon, I viewed blasters closer to some sort of launcher. Rollers have a high spread when you flick them, but blasters have a point of impact aoe."

splatoon,3e0b33,AdvancedBlackOps,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know what everyone's issue with it is. I do occasionally run out of ink in the middle of a firefight, but that's me sucking, not the weapon. I find shitty range way harder to deal with than shitty ink efficiency. So yeah, I'll deal with having to remember to refill my ink if it means I can take down a sniper from the center platform in Moray."
splatoon,3e0b33,HeyThereImMrMeeseeks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's something very wrong about it outranging nearly ever blaster.   And maybe it does less damage at range, but it can still throw ink on you and halve your health. So now you can't move, can't refill ink, and can't take another shot. So while you press forward for the kill, he's winding up for flick #2 and you'll probably trade kills."
splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,3,Tue Jul 21 12:39:49 2015 UTC,It won't one shot at max range.
splatoon,3e0b33,beckert26,6,Tue Jul 21 03:42:53 2015 UTC,"It also has the slowest rate of fire known to man... seriously I splat Dynamos all the time by flanking them, or just shooting them upon their wind up --- OH! --- and it has horrible ink efficiency."
splatoon,3e0b33,robotoboy20,7,Tue Jul 21 02:17:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest ink efficiency is hardly a concern for the Dynamos because you actually refill enough ink to flick upon charging up.  Although, no matter, they are still a ton easier to deal with compared to the regular Rollers."
splatoon,3e0b33,naiets,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"As an Inkbrush main, my favourite thing to do when encountering a dynamo roller is walking right up to their face and just pimp slap them to death whilst they charge up their shot. It's really funny to do.  Edit: A word"

Excluding the squiffer and the bamboozler, even though it hasent been released yet."
splatoon,3e0b33,DergonSteps,48,Tue Jul 21 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"Chargers do not have the ability to actively roam the battlefield, inking wide areas of turf and attacking unsuspecting foes. Neither can they KO multiple foes at a time, have an incredibly wide flick range, deflect incoming enemy ink or have a hitbox behind the flicker to counter ambushes.  You really can't compare the two"
splatoon,3e0b33,FoxOfShadows,12,Tue Jul 21 00:18:54 2015 UTC,Do note that it is possible to splat two+ people at the same time if they're close enough together.

splatoon,3e0b33,RowahPhen,3,Tue Jul 21 02:25:49 2015 UTC,"My favorite is shooting them while they are swimming away.  Especially when I lead them for a while.  Most clutch sniping I've felt in any game.  Unfortunately,  I barely outrange anyone and the time it takes to charge gets me killed a lot.  Also close range is a death sentence.  Basically, anything we chargers have can be replicated or beat by other weapons easy.  As amazing as it feels and how good I can do,  I know that the other weapons outclass me in more situations.   And that my range is not nearly enough to make up for the jarring weaknesses we have.  Still,  charger for life."
splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:18 2015 UTC,"My advice for you is to git gud with the original E-litre, or whatever splat charger comes with the splat bomb. Any A+ chargers I go up against have either mastered spamming the ground with burst bombs, or tossing a splat bomb down and swimming away, effectively pulling me into a booby-trap of sorts. It really does balance charger weaknesses, and it's mad frustrating to play against."

splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,4,Tue Jul 21 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well, after extensive testing in the training room, I figured out that the tiny laser beam is the actual hitbox.  The worst part is that when you shoot above an enemy with a charger, the ink falling on the ground doesn't do any damage unlike every other weapon in the game. Also, if you shoot a bit on the side of your target, just enough to miss, ink will appear below them, but they won't get any damage apart from the one caused by walking in enemy ink.  Yeah... it's bloody hard to be a charger main. The good side is that when you pick a shooter afterward, you don't even need to aim really, just shooting at the general direction of an enemy will kill them!"
splatoon,3e0b33,Justanotherbiomajor,2,Tue Jul 21 06:06:40 2015 UTC,"Charger for life.  No wonder I've NEVER got a kill by shooting over cover...  Chargers have more weaknesses than anything else, but they don't have any solid benefits other than e liter range,  well that and satisfaction...  I think if anything this game needs, if a buff to the worst weapon type in the game.  Mobility, getting rid of that effing laser that makes stealth impossible, or making charging faster would be welcome changes."
splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,2,Tue Jul 21 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't use chargers unless I'm playing Tower Control, I never feel that in the regular battle mode that it's as an effective coverage tool as automatics and rollers. Maybe that's just me, but I understand the role of a charger (er, ""sniper""), is as support."
splatoon,3e0b33,Toadovsky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree,  because of how easy it is to pick off the opposing team with the sniper, I cannot call it a support weapon.  More like a leading weapon to set up your team to complete the mission."

splatoon,3e0b33,rikku45,8,Tue Jul 21 05:11:35 2015 UTC,that gold roller has too much range  for the amount of damage.
splatoon,3e0b33,Flame8765,18,Tue Jul 21 05:43:43 2015 UTC,"Man, the .96 Gal really is the most powerful shooter in the game. It's outranging every other gun but the Jet Squelcher which takes 4 shots to kill someone as opposed to the 2-shot kill the .96 Gal dishes out despite its low firing rate and accuracy. Plus, the other shooters with slightly shorter-range take 3-4 shots to kill with the exception of the .52 Gal (which can at least be countered with a defense up)  No wonder I went 17-0 with it ._."
splatoon,3e0b33,Acterian,17,Mon Jul 20 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"Splattershot Pro has higher dps, actually.  Its faster to kill in 3 hits with pro than 2 hits with .96.  You lose range (barely) but it makes up for it by having high enough dps to deal with rollers and good ground coverage."
splatoon,3e0b33,robotoboy20,7,Mon Jul 20 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. DPS (fire rate) gets ignored a lot when people call OP constantly... Like there's a HUGE amount of time you can flank Dynamos, and Gals... You can even force them into wasting a ton of their ink giving you an advantage in close... I took out .96 Gals constantly during splatfest running the Custom Jr.  Disruptors ruined their already horrible efficiency making them run out of ink much faster, and reload MUCH slower... Flanking them became a breeze. Truth is that range and power do not make a weapon OP... speed is also a factor... if the Gal fired as fast as the Pro, we'd have a problem... or if the dynamo took as long as the normal splat roller --- then I'd say the complaints that they are OP are legit, as it stands I watch dynamo's get smoked by good players who know how to take advantage of their wind up, and are perceptive when the dynamo decides to get risky.  Truth is the OP rants are salt... pure sodium chloride... that's all... we just need a little water to wash it away. This game is 75% mind games, and trying to play this game like rock paper scissors all the time is all about psyching your opponent... you don't call rock OP because it beats scissors.  PS: Side dodging is a mistake in this game... if they lead their shots (and good players do) you need to back away when they're aggressively pushing, keeping them outside of their effective range... and side flank when you know their ink is low. Bombs help as well... the basic splattershot has burst bombs that are highly underrated even though they do a maximum of 60 dmg directly and around 30 from splash, and can be spammed due to what little ink they use."
splatoon,3e0b33,1338h4x,6,Tue Jul 21 00:41:15 2015 UTC,"DPS is a really misleading stat, what people should be looking at is TTK, Time To Kill. Exact damage numbers are irrelevant, only the number of hits it takes to kill matters. The .52 Gal does 52 damage per hit while the .96 Gal does 62 damage per hit, but really those are the same thing - 2 hit kills either way (well, assuming no Defense Up). If you were to compare the raw DPS on those weapons, they seem close enough with the .52 dealing 344.37 DPS and .96 dealing 308.46 DPS. But the actual TTK is a much bigger gap: 0.151s for .52 but .201s for .96!"
splatoon,3e0b33,robotoboy20,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we've just been substituting fire rate and TTK with DPS for unknown reasons even though they're different things entirely. I agree though."

splatoon,3e0b33,AkiyamaRuss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:30 2015 UTC,used to love it but you run out of ink so quickly and the inkstrike special is so annoying to use in the heat of battle
splatoon,3e0b33,Acterian,2,Tue Jul 21 05:59:15 2015 UTC,I recommend taking Ink-Saver (Main) on your hat and you are pretty much good to go.  Inefficiency with Ink is a small drawback compared to what other weapons give up.
splatoon,3e0b33,SkyeKuma,3,Tue Jul 21 05:44:09 2015 UTC,"Try running forged with ink saver main.   Point sensor at choke points can lead to easy pushes and kills because you outrange and out dps any gun that could touch you at max distance.   Inkzooka is gaining a lot of popularity recently as its a charger that travels at the speed of light.   Generally it's regular for zones and forged for tower control, but both work well in either mode.   I actually stopped using ink saver when I started dipping back into my ink whenever I splatted someone. I'm never in kid form as often as I am when using any other weapon."
splatoon,3e0b33,BikiniSunday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:03 2015 UTC,"Run an ink saver main and you'll never have a problem with it. You can also use a Forge edition (which is what I use) and it swaps inkstrike for inkzooka, which I much prefer."

splatoon,3e0b33,Pizzatruck,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"This may have been mentioned in other comments but just looking at maximum range is not a fair analysis of how well a weapon performs at range. Some weapons simply have reduced damage at maximum range, such as the Dynamo Roller, or some do not have good accuracy at their maximum range, hit at a slightly different height because of projectile drop off, making aiming difficult, and the projectile takes a relatively long time to get there. This affects the .96 Gal, for example.  Also the Squiffer, like all chargers, has a straight shooting, almost instant one-hit kill at maximum range so in reality it usually beats the Splattershot Pro, Dual Squelcher and .96 Gal at range, even though they can technically hit beyond its range. Provided you make the shot."
splatoon,3e0b33,Manamanky,15,Tue Jul 21 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly people wonder why the cry for the rollers to be nerfed hard is so popular, The Dynamo is a perfect example of this, I don't even think it's even deniable at this point, Rollers NEED to be nerfed and nerfed hard."

splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,20,Tue Jul 21 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no roller should be up there with the sniper-class of weapon when talking about range.  It's effectively a shotgun-sniper spray weapon."

splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,8,Tue Jul 21 00:49:43 2015 UTC,But it takes time to charge up! Exactly like a charge rifle  And it's got a bad maneuverability! But still better than the charge rifle  Such a joke.
splatoon,3e0b33,AreYouDeadYet9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:35:12 2015 UTC,But if you have a short range gun its hard to win a 1 v1 because all they have to do is keep shooting. If you want to get close to them you have to cover the floor but by the time you cover it they just shoot once and it's covered again
splatoon,3e0b33,bart64,-5,Tue Jul 21 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"But isn't it just another weapon you have to learn to avoid and engage, like the sniper? Once everyone catches on, it will have a tough time staying alive long enough to do any real damage. It's definitely the closest to an arm cannon type weapon."
splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,11,Tue Jul 21 03:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that if they see you, you're dead. A Splattershot Pro takes three shots to kill, by the time it can get in-range and take a few shots, the Dynamo has aimed and splatted you in one shot. Even if you're outside their one-shot range, they can still spray so much ink that you're slowed, health is halved, and you can't refill ammo or get away. So the second shot will kill you.   There are other one-shot weapons, but they lack the range/spread of the Dynamo, so you can counter them. I have honestly no idea how to approach the Dynamo Roller who knows what they're doing.   Early on, people complained that the Kraken Roller was OP but that was just because of the special Kraken. The roller wasn't anything special, so when they used the special, you could just run away, not a great counter, but a counter. The Dynamo isn't a special weapon, it's the main weapon that's OP and doesn't have drawbacks that's outweigh the positives."
splatoon,3e0b33,bart64,0,Tue Jul 21 04:37:54 2015 UTC,"Nice explanation, thanks. My point was that if you recognize the dynamo roller soon enough, there is no reason you should lose to it. Yes, if your a flanked unexpectedly you are screwed, although with the 2 second delay, there is still a chance you will get out of the way by chance."
splatoon,3e0b33,versusgorilla,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"My problem is that even after being killed six times and knowing exactly where a Dynamo Roller is, it's still too difficult to flank him. He's got a wide area of attack and is probably hop-flicking, so unless you can somehow sneak directly behind him, he's gonna do it again. With that range he has, only an E-liter can take some time to fire at him. Everyone else has to be within flick range to hit, and nearly every gun has to be within one-hit-kill range to get hits.   Honestly, the Dynamo shouldn't outrange the Nozzle or any sniper-chargers. It's like having a shotgun-sniper combo. Range and power and spread. Pick two."
splatoon,3e0b33,bart64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"I feel you man and I'm done defending the balance here. I do think that the chart is a little deceptive, though, because it shows the paint area and not the hit area. I haven't tested it yet, but I think the dynamo's hit radius is shorter than it's paint, unlike some of the gun weapons."
splatoon,3e0b33,DergonSteps,4,Tue Jul 21 03:38:48 2015 UTC,"You can't avoid and engage easily when it can easily back up, flick ink, or just roll over them. Even when they are caught off guard it can be hard to kill."
splatoon,3e0b33,SocialDissent,6,Tue Jul 21 06:05:32 2015 UTC,"The problem is people say rollers need to be nerfed, when two of the three rollers don't need to be nerfed at all. The dynamo is possible, but we really need to spend more time as a lot of people seem quick to cry nerf just because they haven't figured out how to deal with a weapon type.  Also while this chart shows maximum range it doesn't show effective range. The splat roller at max range does around 25 damage which means 4 swings to get a kill. How long does it take to flick that roller 4 times compared to how long it takes a mid-range gun to shoot 3 shots?"
splatoon,3e0b33,SkyeKuma,15,Tue Jul 21 12:49:27 2015 UTC,Dynamos can OHKO me at optimal splatterpro range. It's either we trade or I straight out die.   It either needs a range Nerf or a heavier drop off in damage as it travels.

splatoon,3e0b33,YoureASquidNow,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:32 2015 UTC,And the weapons from left to right are:
splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,2,Tue Jul 21 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"As a splat charger,  I hate Squelchers and gals the most.  Dynamo is starting to cause some problems,  but I hate the idea that I cannot reliably outrange those rapid blasters.  That and they kill faster than I can charge is extremely irritating.   I don't use the e liter because it feels like an ENORMOUS trade to drop charge time/ mobility for the added range.  I constantly want to go back to the squiffer because of its different playstyle, but I love being a ""sniper"" and the scope is sexy...  (Edit when I said rapid blasters I forgot about the actual ""rapid blaster"". Which is a sheet weapon and not a problem).   Edit 2:  also Squelchers aren't THAT bad,  just annoying sometimes.  Same with dynamo I suppose."
splatoon,3e0b33,SomeonesYiffAlt,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"I don't use the e liter because it feels like an ENORMOUS trade to drop charge time/ mobility for the added range.   I used to hate the e-liter as well, but it's actually a lot of fun if you can find good channels to fire down. In wide open spaces, and even over walls, it's actually an OK trade-off. You can go the entire length of Kelp Dome in 2 - 2.5 or so shots, letting you get to position to lock down areas really fast.  The burst bomb is also hilarious if anyone catches you up close. A light charge and burst bomb in quick succession has saved me in many close matchups."
splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:32 2015 UTC,"After running my mouth in this thread, I decided to do a ton of research.  And while, yes, the e liter has its use, Its weaknesses are more exploitable in more situations.  Plus the scope's specials kinda beat the liter.  E liter is the best for range, but you are sacrificing kill time, wich can more often than not be your demise.  The e liter will be better in August when we have communication.  But for now, anything you can do with the e liter can be done better by scope's.  The exception is a few spots on fewer maps where you can shoot across important areas is the map.  (Saltspray comes to mind).  I like it, but as a charger user, the scope is the best option."
splatoon,3e0b33,Dan_Ugore,2,Tue Jul 21 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"There is no ""best option"" as every loadout compliments playstyles differently. I like the E-Liter because it's actually dangerous close-up and has monster range. You also don't need a full charge to kill only 3/4 so the charge time isn't too bad."
splatoon,3e0b33,freelancespy87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Full charge is also not necessary for the scope.  Because of this, the scope is much faster than E liter anyway.  Liter has its use,  but Scope has more than it does more often."
splatoon,3e0b33,AfroNinja360,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:45 2015 UTC,Very outrageous! This is gonna help a lot with finding a powerful weapon!
splatoon,3e0b33,Navolas2,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:16 2015 UTC,Not on there but worth noting: the chargers with scopes shoot  1 bar further than their non-scoped counterparts.   Not sure if this will be the case for the E-Liter scope though.  Also: grumble grumble Dynamo OP grumble grumble.
splatoon,3e0b33,Tokenofhon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:13:32 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, no wonder the dynamo is so annoying to vs. 1HKO and outranged every weapon i use by quite a bit..  I really hope the dynamo roller is nerfed soon because theyre a bit ridiculous atm"
splatoon,3e0b33,CHAINMAILLEKID,2,Tue Jul 21 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"I say give the roller a range between the splattershot jr. and aerospray, and the dynamo roller a range between the Nzap and splattershot.  Make the .96 gal 3 hits to KO."
splatoon,3e0b33,Exaskryz,9,Tue Jul 21 17:58:26 2015 UTC,".96 gal being 2 hit KO is perfectly fine with it's slower rate of fire. One might argue for the .52 to go to 3 hit KO, but it's shorter range IMO makes it fair there."
splatoon,3e0b33,CHAINMAILLEKID,2,Tue Jul 21 10:37:16 2015 UTC,I think you underestimate the advantage of range.
splatoon,3e0b33,Exaskryz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"As a .96er myself, I know full well how deadly range is because only laggy Dynamos consistently beat me."
splatoon,3e0b33,CHAINMAILLEKID,2,Tue Jul 21 06:27:32 2015 UTC,"Two hits even at the low rate of fire gives a low enough Time to kill to be deadly even at close ranges. Its effective across a large swath range spectrum because its Time to kill is above average ( faster ), better than many shorter range weapons.  Requiring 3 hits to KO will force .96 gal users to utilize their ability to out range opponents, taking away much of their ability to take people by surprise at close range. That shouldn't be an reliable and effective option when you have the range a .96 gal has got."
splatoon,3e0b33,robotoboy20,2,Tue Jul 21 00:21:48 2015 UTC,The Splattershot Pro is a 3 hit KO though... and it fires faster... why would they make it effectively worse than the Pro?
splatoon,3e0b33,CHAINMAILLEKID,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"Hmmm...  Well the pro does have pretty poor ink efficiency, That could still be fair.   If it were 2 hits to KO with a damage up main or three subs that might be just the right spot."
splatoon,3e0b33,NeJin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:40 2015 UTC,"Y'know, it's too bad Splatoon doesn't use range-based damage - dealing less damage up close would be the perfect solution for the 96. Gal otherwise."
splatoon,3e0b33,CHAINMAILLEKID,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"There are other things that splatoon has.  Like each shot has a different ""blast radius"" And also there is a much greater difference in how much spread each weapon has in splatoon vs traditional shooters.  Both those things are just a little hard to measure, so we don't talk about them much."
splatoon,3e0b33,AkiyamaRuss,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:34 2015 UTC,not all about range ;)   personally I love the splatershot jr for up close combat (although them nurfing the bubbler sucks)
splatoon,3e0b33,Llamia,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:30 2015 UTC,When did they nerf the bubbler?
splatoon,3e0b33,AkiyamaRuss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:57 2015 UTC,around the same time they did the kracken. People never used to be able to shoot you away like that before

splatoon,3e0b33,Corne777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:18:49 2015 UTC,Seeing this chart makes me want to spend a couple nights playing dynamo as opposed to my normal carbon roller. I've only played a few matches with dynamo and haven't given it enough of a chance I think. Every time I try it the jarring difference between fastest roller to slowest roller makes me switch back.
splatoon,3e0b33,yaminokaabii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:04 2015 UTC,"Take your time, don't charge in headfirst, and use that delicious range :3  Also, don't ever roll to ink unless it's the last few seconds/you just want to cover that little patch in front of you."
splatoon,3e0b33,Corne777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"I think coming from carbon roller will be good for your second point, I hardly ever roll since I won't kill anyone I come in contact with by rolling.    But I do rush in all the time since carbon's flicks are so fast, so I'll definitely have to take some time to adjust to that. Recently I hit this B+ wall where all the players are so good I can barely get close to anyone without getting splatted so maybe playing dynamo will help get me into A. After I drop down a bunch from making the switch lol."
splatoon,3e0b33,yaminokaabii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"I meant just inking in general. The Dynamo's flick covers ground a lot faster than rolling. I haven't really tried it myself, but a Dynamo guide on Squidboards claims that flicking and squidding is faster even for straight corridors (e.g. getting out of base on Port Mack), whereas I assume the Carbon Roller would be faster just rolling along. You will rarely EVER roll with the Dynamo. (It's fun spinning in place over an enemy's superjump point though :P )  Dynamo's really fun in Tower Control (my preferred Ranked mode) since you can just rain down onto the tower from afar. Gotta be careful with enemies hiding behind the pole though. Good luck!"

splatoon,3e0b33,Candy2,-5,Tue Jul 21 15:59:48 2015 UTC,Oh my god these posts.  You want to beat the rollers? Use your secondary. Pull forward and to the side when they jump. keep the ground inked and hesitate to push when you know ones around. and krak on splat is so highly preferred than the dynamo at higher ranks because how krak can win without trading when the other player is already shooting at them. If multiple players are dying to a dynamo its maybe a sign you shouldn't stand so close to your teammates!  Rollers provide a good core to this game in how good they are at keeping turf. You push into their turf without a plan you're going to get punished. Once you take that turf from them they're a lot less threatening.

splatoon,3e2nt5,BloodShot9001,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:51 2015 UTC,"My only issue is that it seems like its range should be higher, or the damage should be just enough to get a 1 burst kill, that way you use a disruptor so you can GET that 1 burst kill, at least looking at it from a ""synergizing sub weapons with weapon"" perspective.  The real issue I see with the gun when testing them is that, while I agree it can be used very well, it's more of like a ""High Skill, moderate reward"" gun, compared to guns like the Splattershot Pro which is ""High Skill, High Reward"" or the Aerospray which is ""Moderate Skill, High Reward."" Of course, parts of those are subjective, and an Aerospray might get decimated by a good Nozzlenose (at least it should), but at the same time I think it's so much effort to use a Nozzlenose when you could use guns with better set ups or just easier to use for the same gain.  I do like its accurate paths and its range, but the damage is just too annoying when coupled with how accurate it ACTUALLY is (must stay on target), and how far it is (not as far as a squelcher or even dual squelcher). I'd rather just take the Dual, which has a much better set up anyways (Custom variant, at least). BUT this is my opinion, and I like the idea of the gun (it's definitely different), I just think it might need a bit of fine tuning to compete with the higher end guns. Even if it covers a bit more ink than a Dual Squelcher, it still kind of has the same feel."
splatoon,3e2nt5,KevCar518,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:56 2015 UTC,I never thought that the Splattershot Pro took much more effort than a standard. Who knows we might me getting a heavier version of the Nozzle (hint hint)
splatoon,3e2nt5,KevCar518,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that, I'm actually relatively excited for that one. :P The Pro isn't THAT hard, but it's low ink efficiency and overall accuracy means you have to be somewhat skilled. But even if it's not THAT much skill... that just makes it that much more of a better option than the Nozzlenose. BUT here's hoping the next Nozzle... or... nose weapon... is even better. :P"
splatoon,3e2nt5,frozenpandaman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:29 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what the heavy version could do differently besides be a one burst kill with longer range.  I have made an outfit to go with varying weapon types so I never have problems with ink efficiency. (Unless I'm attempting to use the 96 deco)
splatoon,3e2nt5,KevCar518,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"As a .96 Gal main, I usually stick to Sub Efficiency and Ink Resistance, most of which have Ink Efficiency subs. Only trick is to make sure you have at least 5 or 6 shots ready for engagements. It's mainly just a defensive weapon, especially the Deco. It's more of a ranked mode weapon than turf wars."
splatoon,3e2nt5,kinetik07,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:42 2015 UTC,It's not my best weapon but  it really does feel like the best defensive weapon. Even before the deco. (that is if your ignoring that the .52 Standard exists)
splatoon,3e2nt5,KevCar518,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah I always thought a ""perfect setup"" for the 96 Gal would be Ink Mines and Kraken to make up for its close rangeness, but Splash Wall compliments it a lot as well.

splatoon,3e2nt5,Rauhlplz,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"""Damage Up increases the damage of main, sub, and special weapons up to 130%. However, weapons cannot pass their innate “number of hits to splat” threshold. For example, Aerospray MG has a base damage of 24.5, meaning that it takes five shots to splat at base. It cannot drop below this number, so Damage Up will cap its damage at 24.9, so it still takes five shots to splat. Damage Up is most useful when using weapons with a high rate of fire or those on the lower threshold of their “number of hits to splat.” This is ideal for countering opponents equipped with Defense Up.

splatoon,3e1ni7,Zarkith,11,Tue Jul 21 10:15:36 2015 UTC,you realize that the weapon bar value for range are is not in direct relation to actual range. The E liter scope has a range of 374 vs the 340 of the E liter. These are the numerical values found in the weapon data extracted from the game.

This will just replace the standard E-Litre though because the scope gives slightly more range.

I'm guessing from the subs (particularly the Splash Wall) the Bamboozler 14 is just a shorter range sniper style charger though."
splatoon,3e1ni7,Pizzatruck,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:12 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will replace the standard E-Liter(as an E-Liter main). The added range is minimal, it reduces mobility even further, and the scope causes tunnel vision.  Some may be great with it, but personally, I avoid chargers with scopes. The FOV change is disorienting and messes with your sensitivity. It's much easier to have a consistent sensitivity IMO"
splatoon,3e1ni7,rezb1t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:55 2015 UTC,"Yup I find the scope to be really disorienting. E-liters are the only chargers for me, but I'll be avoiding this."

The mobility on the E-Litre is already terrible though, can't imagine it being less having a major effect, and I imagine with such a large range being able to zoom in would be very useful. Don't use the weapon however and can accept some would prefer without."
splatoon,3e1ni7,Pizzatruck,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:56 2015 UTC,"Splash-O-Matic here, I'm the other way round. I'd prefer Suction Bomb + Inkzooka, but ah well. Personally, Suction Bomb Rush isn't all that useful, as it'd hard to use offensively- it tends to put pressure on putting a ton of bombs down rather than strategic placement, at least for me. Great for Splat Zones though."
splatoon,3e1ni7,Seraphaestus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:00:02 2015 UTC,"I feel Burst Bombs are great for close encounters but not very good at long range. As the Splash-O-Matic is already so good at close quarters it seems like Burst Bombs aren't a terribly useful addition. The Inkzooka is amazing, probably the best offensive special, but Suction Bomb Rush is a close second, especially in Splat Zones. I just feel the Suction Bomb over the Burst Bomb sub makes the original kit a better package generally. Of course everybody has their own preference."
splatoon,3e1ni7,Pizzatruck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:48 2015 UTC,I'm actually looking forward to the Neo Splash actually.  My biggest complaint about the Tentatek Splattershot is the Suction Bombs (i'm not really a big fan of them) while I don't like the stock Splattershot's Bomb Rush.  I know the Splash-o-Matic is a completely different gun but it's finally giving me the sub/special combination I really want while allowing me to use a gun that also fits my playstyle.

splatoon,3e1es3,CatLadyLacquerista,4,Tue Jul 21 08:35:34 2015 UTC,"I can understand the gray area, due to:  1) The ephemeral nature of the work in question ( a splatfest tee that is no longer even available in game)  2) The unmonetized nature of the work ( it's included in the game you paid for, but given to you free separate from what is ostensibly on the disc you paid for )  3) The nature of showing fandom as an expressive act ( because there is no official way to show that you are a fan of Nintendo's newest IP using the medium of the populist, the graphic T )  4) The lack of a white market for such an item ( Stemming from the above three points, leading to no way to pay Nintendo for this temporary, free, expression of fandom )  Additionally, Nintendo uses fan art, with no remuneration to the artist, as in-game decoration, however explicit that relationship is. It stands to reason to some fans, that the relationship is a two-way street, i.e. that they can use Nintendo art to decorate their lives. The pseudo-punk-rock aesthetic adds to the idea that the game is about that kind of free sharing of art.  On the other hand, I like the idea of DIY. I am ambivalent about going local.   We can decide if Redbubble's intentions, as a facilitator of the above kind of copyright infringement, is relevant to the discussion, but I'm not sure I have an answer to that particular question. They might be superfans, fans of fandom in general, or crass Hot Topic-esque co-opters.  Or they might just be a print shop that allows user submissions. Maybe they are working with clean hands and would accept a DCMA violation notice in earnest and return to Nintendo any profits. I don't know how they would, on first blush of the image, even imagine it has anything to do with Nintendo, without some kind of automated Google Goggles lookup.  It's complicated, I suppose.

splatoon,3e1b27,EggheadDash,6,Tue Jul 21 10:40:07 2015 UTC,"The important part is the conclusion and the last table under 'The Rank Transition Matrix'. Steady state is basically the consistent percentage of the playerbase that will end up at this rank.    Score Steady State    C rank 1.18%   B rank 24.9%   A rank 73.9%    Basically, the system means that, in a world where all games are even and all winners are random, there will be almost 75% of the playerbase at A- or above and over 30% at A+ because the game only docks your rank for going below 0, not hitting 0.    the ranking system is giving out more points to players it promotes than it is taking away from players it demotes.   The fix is either going down when you hit 0 or going up when you exceed 100.  Don't worry about the methods, it's just the explanations near the end that are important."
splatoon,3e1b27,squaswin,3,Tue Jul 21 11:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the math, but its not a world where all games are even and all winners are random. I know there are many times I've greatly contributed to my teams victory being responsible for over 50% of my teams kills. I even managed to win 4 of the 3v4 matches the game threw at me in the latest splatfest.  This can also be witnessed when progressing through the ranks, because there's a significant bump in difficulty between B rank and A rank opponents.  So I'm not entirely sure what this analyst is trying to say."
splatoon,3e1b27,Mr_Phishfood,3,Tue Jul 21 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"All the analyst is doing is trying to point out an inherent floor in the system with point inflation. The problem with maths, particularly statistics, is that he cant take player skill into account and if he tried to do matchmaking variations, such as an A rank in a B rank lobby, the problem gets a million times harder.  He has had to simplify most things to make the maths possible. Though ultimately, he is just reinforcing the point that    the ranking system is giving out more points to players it promotes than it is taking away from players it demotes.   From a skill sense. For every good player, there will be a bad player, and those players are more likely to be at their respective end of the table, but with enough games being played, the C ranks will basically start to die out.    What I'm trying to say, is that I'm bad at ELI5 and you should read someone else's reply :P and Happy Cake day"
splatoon,3e1b27,squaswin,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:25 2015 UTC,"Let's say you win or lose 10 score every match. If you get deranked, that was because you were at 0 score. Now you end up at 70 score in the rank below. You lost 10 from the macth and 20 from the derank. On the other hand, if you go up a rank, you do that by reaching a score of 100, after winning a match when you were at 90. After the rank up, you have 30 score in the new rank. So the 10 score you won from the match gets added to the rank up bonus, so you earned 40 score by ranking up.  Of course that ignores the fact that you don't always win or lose 10 points. But the idea is that points from the match are more likely to get lost in transition on the way down."

I just know that, as someone who entered ranking late, I've been deeply bothered by the high percentage of weak players as high as B+ rank. ""What are they even doing at this rank?! How did they get here?!"" was basically my feeling, so I knew something was off. It's a bit depressing to think about.

splatoon,3e1b27,IThoughtThisWasDigg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"These are interesting findings, but I'm curious how much they're affected by the decision to ignore lopsided battles. Many players won't have scores that are divisible by 10, and if you win a battle while your score is greater than 90, you miss out on some points. That would seem to make it more symmetrical. (Edit: I missed the part where the author acknowledges this on my first read.)  Then again, I suppose this might not matter because for every -8 or +8 there's a corresponding +12 or -12, so on average you could say every player's score is effectively divisible by 10. But I'm not sure."
splatoon,3e1b27,gomtuu123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"I thought this was an important point. Since A+ maxes out at 99 and not 100, you only need 10 losses to drop down to A, not 11 losses. I also think it may be safe to assume that at the higher ranks, there's a higher chance of skewed battles - for example, on July 3rd, the day of the Japanese Splatfest, I got in a game with one A, several in the B range, and a couple C+'s. It's not too uncommon to get lower A's and B+'s in the lobby too."
splatoon,3e1b27,yaminokaabii,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"There's an issue with your calculations. You assume exactly 10 points per win/loss, which results in losing only 20 points on a demotion from 0, and 30 point gain on a promotion from 90. However, it is possible (and common) to have 98 points in a rank and get a promotion, earning you only 22 points (still creates a slight skew, but significantly less). Also, I have hit 0 in a rank exactly once before a demotion, usually I'll have between 4 and 8 points which results in larger losses on demotion, the same goes for promotions, having anything above 90 will give lower gain.   I'd say it roughly evens out because you will rarely be at exactly 0 or 90 before a demotion/promotion. You get 8 to 12 points per win/loss based on the rank of the players on each team. I still expect a skew towards high B or A-, but obviously none of this takes skill into account."
splatoon,3e1b27,Zodryn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"this is great in theory but in practice it is innaccurate.  If you had 1million players each play 1,000 matches then this would be quite accurate. However only the top 1,000 players are likely to play 1,000 matches while the bottom 1,000 players may only play 10 matches. This stops the easy points from becoming accumlated pushing the medium ranks up.  Next you have to take into account the very best players are at the highest rank of A+99 already- Each win nets them 0 points yet they defeat the other team resulting in  - 10 points a game per max ranked player. So there is some push back from the top.  I do believe anyone can get out of C rank if they just play enough games but to say 36% of everyone will get to A+ is just crazy in practice. Id say in actuality its likely less then 10% of the total player base who have attempted ranked games will reach max rank as  many average(casual) players wont even play 40+ ranked games."

splatoon,3e1b27,ImaginarySpider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm happy sometime is trying to solve for this, but I don't think your model is right.  I'm not super great at math so I won't use formulas, but I'll try to show some nuance missed in this evaluation.  ""In the steady state, we know that after each battle, the number of players being promoted to from C− to C must be the same as the number of players demoted from C to C−."" This statement is untrue and skews the numbers to allow more players in C ranks than a steady state would create. Less players will fall because of the point creation in c ranks.  An important exclusion is how many matches are played at which point in the ranks. The reason the 8/12 and 6/14 matches matter is that the point creation from the win 3 lose 4 mechanic only happens at exactly 0. Any other number functions exactly the same as a balanced win loss system. Once you land on 0 if you derank you are 7 games away from hitting 0 again. My point here is again that there is lower odds of hitting 0 than is given in this evaluation.  Compare this to A+ 99, the place where points go to die. Every time a 99er wins they kill 10 points, but they are also still at 99 and can kill more next game. It takes a 0 two games to get back to zero, and only if they win and lose an equal amount.  I believe the actual percentage of the population I is skewed toward the c+ b- area and the 0 rank point creation is intended as a counter balance to 99s removing points from the system.  It would be cool if someone wrote a model program to simulate the actual growth of the system from thousands of c- players. But it would be super tough to include some of the variables."
splatoon,3e1b27,momaro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"If all battles are decided purely by chance, then in the long run, nearly 75% of Splatoon players will end up with the rank of A−, A, or A+, with over 36% of players having a rank of A+   Isn't this a big fat duh? It doesn't take a lot of fancy math to figure this out. Players in lower ranks get higher rewards for winning than higher ranked players. That will cause everyone to drift upward artificially. Look mom, no math!"
splatoon,3e1b27,ItsTheMotion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"We can deduce the transition probabilities...from assuming that each battle is decided purely by chance   I think this is the biggest problem with this analysis.  This analysis assumes that every single player has a 50/50 chance of winning at all ranks.  However, I don't think this assumption holds true.  If you take average players and stick them into A+ battles, they will lose more than 50% of the time.  I think it's a little unrealistic to assume that the outcome would be determined purely by chance, skill is obviously very important in this game.  EDIT: Upon further reflection, I can now see why OP makes that assumption.  The assumption is that everyone has already reached state-state, which would mean that everyone is already at the right rank and as such skill doesn't matter, only chance does.

You only stated that he was wrong, but didn't explain how he was wrong. He's saying that skill is the thing that keeps the system churning downward.  Additionally, the system promotes people of identical skill UP, hypothetically, until they hit a point where they are facing people of greater skill. That means that if you have a 50/50 chance against a c-, you should be promoted to c, at which point you will no longer have the 50/50 chance.  I also thought there were problems with the analysis. Mostly I think he's ignoring the effect of lopsided battles, which changes the dynamics of promotions and demotions somewhat."

But it's probably the same reason why Splatoon doesn't contain voice chat and is the richer for it.  I get the math in the article, I still disagree with the assertion that this model provides a nuanced enough view of the ranking system. I don't think it's idiocy to discuss what problems we see with the model.  centenarian was able to succinctly explain what he perceived to be the flaw  in his reasoning when he said, in his most recent edit:   The assumption is that everyone has already reached state-state, which would mean that everyone is already at the right rank and as such skill doesn't matter, only chance does.   I, however, still disagree with the assertion that this model provides a nuanced enough view of the ranking system.  The model is more adequate for ranking within a letter than between. It also fails to account for the fact that A+ caps at 99, which would mean that you are just as likely to lose a level as keep it when you get to that range. It also fails to take into account metagame, which will cause old A+ to fall quickly if they lose touch with the game.  I didn't say the whole analysis was useless, I just think there are a few flaws, and maybe a change to the ranking system based on it was premature.  I'd like to put together a Monte Carlo where each player has a true 'level', 1-9 corresponding to c- to a+, and random teams within 5 leves are put together, with the diminishing returns for unbalanced teams taken into account, and seeing what the numbers would look like at that point.

I was hostile, but I actually really like having these conversations. I was a bit cranky this morning (woke up considerably earlier than normal). I apologize for that. Anyway, I'm okay with Splatoon not having voice chat, but I've had plenty of good discussions with other Splatoon players on here and in a Splatoon Teamspeak server.  I don't think it's stupid to discuss this stuff, but I found the lack of mathematical reasoning in centenary's post bothersome, and I think that he was originally attributing more of a conclusion to the model in the OP than it ever intended to display.   The model is more adequate for ranking within a letter than between.   I don't really know what you mean. Each letter has 100 points (0 through 99 inclusive). There is no such thing as ""between"" a letter.   It also fails to account for the fact that A+ caps at 99, which would mean that you are just as likely to lose a level as keep it when you get to that range.   Are you attempting to invalidate this model because it caps at 100 instead of 99, or did you not realize that the model does have a cap at 100? This simplification was done to ease computations. I (and the author) doubt that putting the cap at 99 (instead of 100) would have much affect on this analysis.   It also fails to take into account metagame, which will cause old A+ to fall quickly if they lose touch with the game.   That's not relevant. Theoretically, as stale A+ players drop in ranks, fresh players will rise--that's how the Splatoon rank system was constructed (somewhat like a simplified Elo system, I believe). Anyway, the analysis attempts to give the steady-state. Fluctuations do not matter.  The only conclusion I'm comfortable drawing from the OP is the steady-state percentage population of every rank, as expressed by the model. This is an approximation. This is not intended to depict the current state, nor the state at any time, and it never claims that. It is the steady-state.   I'd like to put together a Monte Carlo where each player has a true 'level', 1-9 corresponding to c- to a+, and random teams within 5 leves are put together, with the diminishing returns for unbalanced teams taken into account, and seeing what the numbers would look like at that point.

splatoon,3e1b27,centenary,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"which will explain just how unimportant skill is to this model   Let me give an example of why skill needs to be included in the model.  Suppose that tomorrow the number of players doubles, but all of the new players are 3-year-olds who lose the vast majority of their matches.  Because the 3-year-olds lose the vast majority of their matches, the 3-year-olds rarely make it out of C- rank.  Because these 3-year-olds would represent half of the population, that means that the C- rank would also be roughly half of the population, which would disagree with the model's results.  The disagreement would come from the fact that the model doesn't take into account the 3-year-old's skill level, it instead assumes that the 3-year-olds have a 50/50 chance of winning at all rank levels like everyone else.  Obviously this is an extreme example, but it's meant to illustrate that skill does matter and the model can't simply ignore it."
splatoon,3e1b27,centenary,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:57 2015 UTC,"If there were that many 3 year olds, they would surely play each other, and thus have a fair chance of winning.  Besides, the 50/50 chance does not mean that anyone has a 50/50 chance of winning against anyone else, it means you have a 50/50 chance of winning against someone at the same rank as you.

Jumping across the centre of Urchin underpass, leaving your base on Bluefin Depot to the left and hitting the box on the middle tier, Walleye Warehouses noninkable L ramp.  While only minor you really have to get your timing down otherwise the complete lack of momentum screw's you up.  Edits.  Jumping over the glass in Urchin Underpasses raised corridors.  Jumping off the tower in Blackbelly Skatepark.  Those small drops in the right hand passages of Arrowana Mall and Walleye Warehouse."

splatoon,3e2kdx,gomtuu123,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Here are a few reasons I can think of.  First, if you maintained your swim speed while jumping, then the splatterhopping technique (swim to the edge of your ink, jump, shoot in mid air, and continue swimming in your own ink) would be a necessity instead of just a curiosity with little real value. You'd have to travel that way (using a relatively awkward sequence of button presses) or you'd always be slower than players who did. Basically, it would be considered an exploit, and nobody would really like it.  Second, imagine how much more dangerous sneak attacks (from rollers in particular) would be if squids could jump out of their own ink at full swim speed. It would increase the range at which it's possible to splat a player before he can really see you.  Third, if you saw a player jump out of ink in a non-sneak-attack situation, it would be more difficult to shoot him, because he'd be travelling really fast. The game designers probably wanted players to be a little more vulnerable when they squid-jump out of their own ink."
splatoon,3e2kdx,Aaronnoraator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. The only real way to keep up your momentum while jumping is with squidhopping.

splatoon,3e0iup,Cobrakai83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:25:46 2015 UTC,"Not personally, but I kill with sprinklers a lot. They're not just good for coverage - I don't think people fully utilize them with their kill potential. One distracted opponent having a 1v1 with someone on your team, plant one sprinkler behind them and it's just enough to swing the balance in your ally's favour. Even if you don't directly kill them with the spinkler, distracting them with one so that they aim at it while your ally approaches them is also effective. Sprinklers rock."

Especially at higher levels, I get a little frustrated when teammates totally ignore my repeated tapping and just run head first into a lose-lose situation. Next thing to consider... How many teammates are alive when you see someone violently tapping on your name -- because that could be a sign that your team is relying on you to hold down the fort for a few extra seconds."

Sometimes the motivation of needing to clear the area for a jumper does make me play better, but generally speaking, if I've got all I can handle already, someone jumping to me doesn't make me a superhero. I'll clear it if I can, but if I was about to back off and someone's jumping to me because I'm the furthest out even though I'm surrounded by enemy ink, I'm gonna keep on trying to back off. If I can I try to give them some ink around their feet as I Zoidberg the hell outta there, but like others have said, better one of us splatted than both."

If they were jumping to someone in a proper place, then they wouldn't need to be protected.  But if they're jumping to me and I'm deep in enemy territory being shot at, they need to learn that that is not a good place to jump to.  People: please do not jump to places where there is a chance of you getting shot upon arrival.  It is better for you to just swim there than for you to die immediately.  If you're going to jump, jump to someone who is in your territory and where there is little to no danger of you being killed."

splatoon,3dy8bn,Sea-Salt,2,Mon Jul 20 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing about super jumping that I think a lot of people misunderstand though: it shouldn't be used to get you RIGHT into the action. In other words, you shouldn't be jumping to the person that's deepest into enemy territory because then you're begging to be splat. 9 out of 10 times you should be choosing the safest option, not the option closest to the enemy.   For example, if I'm on Urchin Underpass and I see two of my teammates fighting at the main enemy choke point and one who is safely sniping on the side wing, jump to the guy on the side wing. Sure you won't be right in the action, but it will guarantee your safety and it will make it so that your teammates at the choke don't have to put themselves into further danger defending your super jump marker.   There was this one time where I was super deep into enemy ink on Blackbelly, I basically laid down minimal ink and just jump from one to the other in order to sit and surprise the enemy as they walked past. Sure enough, I see the pings and the super jump marker as I'm sitting here stealthing in ink and I'm, ""No no no, wtf are you doing?!?!?"" One of the enemies saw his marker, one shot me with a blaster, and then shot him immediately afterwards. He completely ruined my stealth attack because he wanted to jump to the position furthest into enemy territory."

splatoon,3e0kr9,GreenOrangeYellow,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that's the problem.   Splatterjumping eases the opening and closing effects of the dynamo rollers, causing them to cancel the movement lag that comes after the flick."
splatoon,3e0kr9,robotoboy20,14,Tue Jul 21 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"The best way I handle Dynamos (and the way I most frequently get killed by when I use one myself) is to throw a bomb under them. Dynamos are always jumping, and you're super vulnerable during jumps, so they're pretty much screwed if you do that at just the right time."
splatoon,3e0kr9,DergonSteps,11,Tue Jul 21 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"Disruptors also gimp their jumping ability to hell... and they're instant... so you basically destroy one of their key techniques, effectively making it much easier to deal with them."

Anyone with an Eliter 3k is going to probably win the range battle.  Getting behind me or close range (not too close to get rolled though). A lot of the dynamo roller's strats is heavily reliant on me identifying what you're doing next. The moment you flank me, I'm pretty much defenseless.  Mines. I'm pretty much always jumping, so if you time it right, it's over a second of an animation that I have to wait through before I can swim or jump away."

splatoon,3e0kr9,naiets,6,Tue Jul 21 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"The insane windup and recovery time. IMHO Dynamos are the easiest rollers to kill if you're not charging them head-on. How I deal with Dynamo Rollers is wait until they jump flick (which they tend to do 24/7), then dive in and kill them before they can even get a second flick off. Regular rollers and especially the Carbon types can react to such a surprise attack and still trade -- a Dynamo can't.  I will say that there are some map-specific issues where you virtually can't approach a Dynamo user, but the same goes for E-Liter 3K players."
splatoon,3e0kr9,coolrudski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:25:57 2015 UTC,"E-Liters do have to aim though, so you can try to be ninja and not swim towards them in a straight line. Dynamos simply aim in your general direction, press ZR and splat."

splatoon,3e0kr9,coolrudski,3,Tue Jul 21 12:22:15 2015 UTC,"Also disruptors work really well to get rid of the jumping tech the roller is fairly reliant on... I take out dynamos with the Custom Jr. and L-3 a lot! Dynamos are really good in the right hands, and they can be really intimidating when they taunt you with their range... and splat you because they knew you were going to sneak up on them... they can even appear psychic at times, but the truth Dynamos are just super spatially aware... welcome to the age of new types my friends."
splatoon,3e0kr9,Malbat,5,Tue Jul 21 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why flanking seems so difficult for some people, but it apparently is. Like guys, come on, the best time to shoot at a Dynamo is obviously right after he's flicked once and is charging up for a second - why aren't you actively dodging his flicks and getting him when he's vulnerable, and why are you standing there and trying to fend him off when you know you're gonna get splatted?  Regular Rollers, however, have just enough spread on flicking to catch flankers and just enough speed to dive and close the range right after flicking."
splatoon,3e0kr9,AdvancedBlackOps,4,Tue Jul 21 03:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have no idea why people try to shoot at me while I'm flicking. Most people just seem to come at me and try to rush me like its a scene from Braveheart, then just meet their demise. No matter how much you will yourself, your Aerospray isn't going to suddenly have some sort of mystical, ranged homing ink.   A second of animation is long, and if I'm alone, it's not that hard to hit me in a blind spot after a few seconds"
splatoon,3e0kr9,naiets,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"Lag. That is the reason it may seem like I'm attacking a Dynamo head-on, when my usual reaction to seeing one anywhere near me is to get the hell outta there. Laggy Dynamos=not fun."

splatoon,3e0kr9,sunwupen,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:00 2015 UTC,"Dynamos are generally not a problem, but on specific maps they are ridiculously powerful.  For example, on Arowana Mall, they can stand on top of the middle and rain ink down on anyone approaching the center.  It's not really possible to throw bombs up at them without first getting in range of their ink.  There are three ways to flank the position, but two of them (the ledges above to the left and right) can be hit by dynamos, so a single dynamo player by themselves can lock down most attempts to take the middle, freeing the other three players to do other things.  And the position is a chokehold, so if you can't take the position, the game is pretty much over.  There are certainly ways to counter it (e.g. inkstrike), but I don't think anyone can deny how powerful the dynamo can be on that map."
splatoon,3e0kr9,WugOverlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:28 2015 UTC,"As a dynamo user there is the obvious con about us and that is the attack speed, my most splatted moments is when im winding my attack only to be quickly shot down from any weapon.

splatoon,3e0kr9,sunwupen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:54:54 2015 UTC,The biggest problem I have with the Dynamo Roller is when I end up swimming into range and dying before I can react because they've already started to swing their roller before I got their.
splatoon,3e0kr9,WugOverlord,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:30:49 2015 UTC,Those things are just stupid as a weapon ... nothing else.  Played some Turf War on Walleye Warehouse against a Dynamo Roller. Right the second we got pushed back from the middle zone. The Dynamo was just standing in front to that next area right to our base and was just spamming his Flick .... over and over again. He did NOTHING else the whole time for the rest of the match. But because of its stupid range there was nothing you could do. Either go forward and get one shoted or go around and get splatted by his teammates who were controlling all other exits ...

For instance, 6 subs for defense up does NOT equal 2 main defense ups"
splatoon,3dyj84,MrRavine,5,Mon Jul 20 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"Technically it would be worth more, because main abilities have diminishing returns as well. For the majority of abilities, a main is twice as effective as a sub. If you have more than two of an ability (main or sub) then any additional one is halved.  So take swims speed up for example. One Main would increase your swim speed by 10%. One sub would increase your swim speed by 5%. But if you had one main, and one sub, then it would increase your swim speed by 12.5%, because the 2nd would be halved. If you had 2 mains, then it would increase your swim speed by 15%. 3 mains, 20%. 2 subs, 7.5%. 3 subs, 10%. 4 subs, 12.5%. 5 subs, 15%. So it would only take 5 subs to equal 2 mains.  This is the rule for all abilities except for Ink Saver Main, Special Saver, and Special Charge up. These abilities do not have diminishing returns. Sub special charge up is only worth a third as much as a main, though.  Information taken from this page, which seems to be the most accurate based on testing other players have performed. Also, not all abilities have completed info, so it's possible there are other abilities without diminishing returns."
splatoon,3dyj84,Pacman1up,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"This is the rule for all abilities except for Ink Saver Main, Special Saver, and Special Charge up. These abilities do not have diminishing returns. Sub special charge up is only worth a third as much as a main, though.   This is actually not true. Stacking a ton of Special Savers should give you 100% of your special after death, however; this is only achievable after stacking all mains and all subs.  If it were true, then each sub would be worth 6.25% and each main would be worth 12.5% meaning that you could hit 50% (full saver) with 2 main special savers and 4 subs.   I've tested this with much more: See images  Gear https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJka2c-UcAAgTLo.jpg:large  Full Charge https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJks0GGUYAAutMB.jpg:large  After Death https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJktQYuUcAA-Ui-.jpg:large"

splatoon,3dyj84,MrRavine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a cool factor to the triple gear with triple sub abilities, but I'm not so sure it's the most effective. Since a unique sub ability is worth half as much as a main, having a variety of subs seems to be the best option. The exception being ink saver main, which is a wonderful ability without diminishing returns."

splatoon,3dyj84,Justanotherbiomajor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"almost like it punishes the ""meta"" game of rerolling for perfect matches...   That depends a lot on the weapon you use and your play style. A charger who spend most of the game camping will be much better with a many ink savers (main) and ink recovery up than a variety of sub abilities that may simply have no, or very limited uses. In that case, having perfect triple subs on gears will be more helpful than having varied ones."
splatoon,3dyj84,carboncopymusic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:49 2015 UTC,I'm the guy that tries to meet the other guy in the middle and kill him before he kills me.  I'm highly active and aggressive.  I don't like sitting still and seldom camp. I actively hunt and punish snipers and also play to get the enemy to waste time chasing me.  I play to be obnoxious and try to build vendettas so that they'll waste time hunting me instead of doing their job.  In turf war I play spray and pray weapons (splattershot sr/jr/aereospray) and sometimes the carbon roller.  I don't enjoy sniping gameplay.    In ranked I'm most a .52 player with the seeker and the inkstrike.  I will occasionally gold roller it.  I'm a fallen A that goes between low B and A-.  Never seen A+.  Any ideas/advice would be great :)
splatoon,3dyj84,Justanotherbiomajor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a shooter guy, so for gears and abilities, you'll have to think about what you struggle the most with.  If you often try to shoot enemies that are a bit out of range, having a strength up or two will help. The .52 gal is relatively ink efficient, so I wouldn't bother with ink saver main or ink recovery. In higher level matches, the seeker is really not a good sub as people just jump over it to avoid it or with shoot at it if they think you're following it so I wouldn't bother with ink saver sub either.  Since you seem to really like inkstrikes, yet you are always at the front, I would go for some Zekko gears with Special Saver Sub (according to the wiki two subs equal one main, for that one, so that would be worth it). Then you should keep those inkstrikes until your team is about to attack. Don't shoot the inkstrike in the zone, that would only be a waste of special as people can just shoot at it to cancel the effect. Instead, shoot it at the enemy line to disorganize them and force them to either retreat or move toward you were you'll be taking them on. Shooting right behind an enemy sniper can also do wonder as their only place to retreat is down their perch where your team will be waiting for them."
splatoon,3dyj84,From_japan_with_rabu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"I play pretty similar sometimes.  I use the Firefin Jungle Hat and lucked out so it has ink three saver subs.  I use gear with ninja squid, they roll for ink saver, damage up, defense up, and ink saver so I usually go with either ink saver (if I'm playing aggressively and will die a lot) or damage up (if it helps the weapon), and the blue moto boots with ink resistance and run speed up as the subs. The only downside to this loadout is you can't swim fast enough. I really like the ninja squid ability though, especially when playing aggressively. It's nice to just disappear. I am working on shoes with swim speed and run speed.  With a 52 gallon I don't worry about running out of ink as I hide a lot and will often get a lot of kills by just surprising people with seekers. I will also sacrifice myself because I don't lose as much of my special for dying.  There are a lot of other things to do, but that's just what I like for my aggressive styles."

splatoon,3e32mo,AliceTheGorgon,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:18 2015 UTC,I met up with the old dude in the sewer once that was it. I'll get back on it. Thanks!
splatoon,3e32mo,Mr_Phishfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:26 2015 UTC,Think of it as a long tutorial for multiplayer.
splatoon,3e32mo,TheDizzyness,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:50 2015 UTC,Play Single Player in order to familiarize yourself with everything.
splatoon,3e32mo,bralko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"After the tutorial you can go into the options on your gamepad and disable motion controls.  Other than that, the old dude in the sewer = story mode. Pretty cool puzzle shooter single player missions, defeat bosses to unlock additional weapon sets from the store.  play online to level up, max level = 20.  Higher level = able to buy more weapons and clothing. Clothing takes a while to cycle as it only refreshes once per day.  Don't underestimate low level weapons! Even level 20 players use weapon sets from levels 1-10."
splatoon,3e32mo,AliceTheGorgon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"Don't underestimate low level weapons!   Yep. The weapons themselves aren't ""low level"" per se, you just unlock some of them earlier than others. Even the default weapon you start with has a bunch of fans."
splatoon,3e32mo,StimulatorCam,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"Also, don't underestimate low level clothing.  After a Splatfest you can use your shells to max slots even without getting to level 20 first."

splatoon,3e32mo,TheDizzyness,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"the DLC stuff was mostly already on the disk just not fully implemented - they rushed Splatoon to release so it would be out in time for early summer. They've been regularly updating the game though which is the nice thing, and if I'm not mistaken we still have another 5 maps or so left to be released."
splatoon,3e32mo,AliceTheGorgon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:22 2015 UTC,5 maps?! I've barely managed to get ahold of the ones on here already! Lol. But that's awesome to hear that they have been on top of everything in this game

splatoon,3e32mo,yaminokaabii,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"Here's my boilerplate text I give to people who ask about the gyro controls:   If you need to finetune the sensitivity of the gyro, you can enter the weapons test room (press Y in equip menu or weapons shop) and open the controls menu on the GamePad and test your weapons. Once you have your perfect sensitivity, get some practice in the Single Player levels (you will unlock some weapons when you beat each boss as well)"
splatoon,3e1npn,minz1,8,Tue Jul 21 07:12:17 2015 UTC,"Play through the campaign first, it will give you an upper hand. By the time you beat it you will have the mechanics down pat. (You don't have to beat the whole thing, but I recommend it because you get cool clothes and the end boss is really fun!)  Try out different weapons in training and see what you like. Splattershot Jr. Is the starter gun and works pretty well for beginners. From there you'll find how you like to play and can choose your weapon accordingly.  Turf Wars is not very balanced, so don't be offput by it. Ranked on the other hand is very balanced and accommodates for all playstyles on all maps.  Most importantly, stay fresh!  EDIT: Sorry for any spelling errors and I would write more but I'm on my phone!"
splatoon,3e1npn,KevCar518,6,Tue Jul 21 07:17:11 2015 UTC,I can't agree with Kev more. Learn the mechanics in single player first. When you do venture online Don't get disheartened by coming bottom of the leader board. lVL20 players have many more gear slots and better weapons than you! The best advice I can give is stick to the games objective.  Start out by inking up areas of the turf that others have missed instead of treating it like a deathmatch and hunting down opponents. That's the downfall of many new players.
splatoon,3e1npn,spoonzdog,4,Tue Jul 21 07:25:23 2015 UTC,"YES, I totally forgot to mention that. ITS ALL ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE. Covering turf is your main priority, followed by not dying and denying turf to enemies. Turf War is not about killing, although it does play a factor.  In the ranked modes, you have to think the same way. Objective is #1 priority.   This game is very different than other shooters and that may take some adjustment but it really pays off if you are able to make said adjustment."
splatoon,3e1npn,KevCar518,2,Tue Jul 21 07:36:22 2015 UTC,You don't have to beat the whole thing   Yes you do. You need to experience the final boss.
splatoon,3e1npn,frozenpandaman,3,Tue Jul 21 08:38:47 2015 UTC,"Painting the walls doesn't count towards the total... I dunno if this is obvious but when I first started I wasted so much time doing it. Also winning doesn't really matter, just put down as much ink as you can as that is what you get most your reward from, winning only gives you a 300 bonus."
splatoon,3e1npn,SerialHugger,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:59 2015 UTC,If you do the campaign find all the kettles in the area first then do which ever you like. Also you can super squid jump to any kettle you have found. (I didn't know of these till I beat the campaign.)
splatoon,3e1npn,Kurondrion,2,Tue Jul 21 08:17:21 2015 UTC,"Stick with the motion controls.  They're frustrating at first, but it helps precision with some of the more powerful guns.  Be careful about pushing too far without backup or an exit.  Getting stuck in enemy ink makes you easier to kill.  And its easy to be surrounded. Run away if you get the chance unless you have the jump on them.  Staying alive is very important in Ranked.  Watch out for jump markers.  If its an ally....stick around and provide some cover fire for them.  You can often get an easy kill when enemy players are focused on killing the jumper. Enemy jump markers should be easy kills, but keep some distance.  If you are jumping to a player, jump to a group.  Don't jump to the one that is on their own in enemy territory unless you are positive they're winning or alone.  Many times, you'll jump to a player that has just died or moved away/fleeing and pursuing players are there to kill you.  Painting walls can make a great hidden route or exit.    Know weapon range.  You can pick your fights better.  Going down a one way corridor against a good charger player is a good way to get shot.   Always be in squidform if possible."
splatoon,3e1npn,Howell_Jenkins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who also started out the game, I can suggest you to start out with the singleplayer campaign. It will aid you to get ahold with the controls, mechanics and general gameplay."
splatoon,3e1npn,JMAAMusic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:46 2015 UTC,Stay fresh!
splatoon,3e1npn,Jeffdk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'll add some more tips.  Lvl does not equal skill. There are some trash lvl 20 players out there. Lvl only help unlock more weapons for you to use. Hitting lvl 4 lets you buy different gear and to order stuff from Spyke. Hitting lvl 10 unlocks Ranked mode. Hitting lvl 20 lets you have access to Spyke's gear rerolling abilities.   As for weapons, it's good to have a few mains. I main the Areospray RG, Carbon Roller, Splat Roller, Krak-On Roller, and Splash-O-Matic.   It's good to have options depending on the game mode you're playing.  Shooters are the most well rounded guns. They have good range and cover lots of ground.   Blasters are a subcategory of Shooters. They shoot out an ink ball that bursts at the end of their range. They're harder to ink ground with, but great for splatting people at short range.   Rollers are your short range/melee weapons. They cover a lot of ground in a small area very quickly. If a roller is left unchecked, they can basically turn the tide of the game. They are very good for being stealthy and flanking.   Ink Brush is a subcategory of Rollers. They are also melee focused and are incredibly fast. Very good for silently infiltrating the enemy line and sneaking up on people. However they don't cover that much ground by moving around. They cover more ground by swinging their brush. It's one of the more tricky weapon types to learn how to use effectively.  Last are Chargers. They are basically snipers. Some come with scopes, while others don't. They don't ink quite as much ground, but are effective for splatting people on high ground.  Turf Wars is the more casual multiplayer mode. Don't worry too much if you win or lose or your placement on the leader board. It's just a really good mode for you to try out weapons, new tactics, level up your gear, or just to have fun and relax. You get points regardless if you win or lose, but you get a small bonus if you win.  Ranked mode is much more competitive, you rack up a lot of points if you win, but you get none if the enemy wins by knockout. There are currently two game types: Splat Zone and Tower Control. You want to choose a weapon that is suited for the map and the game type.  Try to stay alive if you can. It's okay to run away and go on the defense. It's a lot better than wasting time respawn and swimming back into the action."
splatoon,3e18p9,Bluichu,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"Uhm.  Damage up doesn't work that way, and frankly it rarely never takes a blaster more than 3 remotely damaging shots to splat me. Even rapids. Damage up can't break the min number of shots it takes to splat."
splatoon,3e18p9,Lethalgeek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:41 2015 UTC,"I think it may be because the splash from the blasters damage increases as well, but correct me if I'm wrong here."
splatoon,3e18p9,DownThrowToAnything,4,Tue Jul 21 07:06:13 2015 UTC,"As with all the other weapons, Damage Up cannot make a weapon one shot an enemy if it can't normally do that with its regular base stat. A direct hit from a Rapid Blaster with all these damage ups would still do 99.9% damage with all the damage ups but would still not kill because of that 00.1% (bummer)  Interestingly enough, with the splash damage, it is able to reach above 50% with those damage ups slots, but without them, the base damage would be around 39-44% iirc, so in all those damage ups make it a 2HKO instead of thee ol' 3HKO saying that the enemy has no defense ups."
splatoon,3e18p9,Mr_Phishfood,3,Tue Jul 21 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"SO THAT'S HOW ITS DONE!  My Comment from 12 days ago   I can't figure out why any of the rapid blasters are useful in the slightest. It takes 2 direct hits or 3 indirect hits to kill, the rate of fire isn't so rapid that it becomes useful.  In my 130 hours of play I have not seen a single good person with it.  If I find such a person they would have my respect."
splatoon,3e18p9,Acterian,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:53 2015 UTC,"It's pretty rare to find someone using these little guys, it's even more of a surprise factor when you're actually facing a experienced one. Respect for both of us, lets show them the power of Rapid Blasters! :D"
splatoon,3e18p9,KevCar518,2,Tue Jul 21 12:58:49 2015 UTC,"So wait, the first step is giving up ink resistance, stealth super jump, cold blooded, and ninja squid and ink saver so you can actually deal reasonable damage?"
splatoon,3e18p9,KevCar518,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, better than being useless. With those Damage Ups, at least you have a chance with those other monsters lurking out there. (.96, Dynamos, etc.)"

splatoon,3e2piz,errortype520,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"You've probably been sorted into the general population.  There was an article that says that the way players are matched is not by levels, but by what they focus on in a match.  If you focus on inking, you're matched with those sorts of players.  If you focus on kills, you're matched with those sorts of players.  I don't know what level the matching happens at but it is definitely somewhere between Levels 1-10.  I want to say 5 but that's just a guess."
splatoon,3e2piz,BladeJager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:12 2015 UTC,I would assume straight away.  It's not until level 5 that you've killed a fair few people and start to veer off the course of just inking.
splatoon,3e2piz,pbzeppelin1977,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'd hope not or would hope that your sorting can change because you wouldn't have enough data on someone to say, this person is going to consistently go for mostly kills or mostly inking in Turf Wars."
splatoon,3e2piz,BladeJager,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:19 2015 UTC,"I can change however it'd be very hard to go to inking from killing.  You're level 20, you've got over 50 hours in the game and you've been playing with all the weapons available.   Even after hundreds of matches you've probably got thousands of kills.  Let's pretend that you've averaged 5 kills a match over 200 matches.  If you then spend the next 100 matches never killing you'll still be averaging 3.33 kills a match, 2.5 at 400 matches and even 1.25 at 800 matches assuming you've gone the entire 600 never killing.  Let's say you're coupled with other players who average 1.25 kills per game. Over 8 players that still averages out that there will be 10 deaths per match.  This doesn't even take into consideration how many accidental or lucky kills you'd get.  While you can change it'd be very hard.  To get to the point of everyone inking and being peaceful you'd need to have less than 0.125 kills per game. Given the previously stated 1,000 kills over 200 games you would then need to play a further 7,801, thus 8,001 total completely clean matches before you ever reach that point.  TL;DR  If you want to play with other inkers make a new account."
splatoon,3e2oz6,bluewords,4,Tue Jul 21 14:26:51 2015 UTC,Yes. As a necessary precaution to prevent people from disconnecting when losing.
splatoon,3e2oz6,frozenpandaman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:44:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is a common complaint on the sub with proponents for and against the idea.  Some say that it unfairly punishes legit connection failures (especially when they happen so frequently in this game) and some say it deters people from turning off their WiiU when they're losing a match to stop themselves from losing rank."
splatoon,3dz004,bizitmap,13,Mon Jul 20 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that many people already knew this, but thanks for making a thread on it.

splatoon,3dz004,DergonSteps,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:18 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that small height level changes (like the little bumps and low platforms on the ground in port mackerel) cause a weird auto-aim jump downwards that can screw up aiming at anyone on or just behind them. The sprinkler seems to do that same thing, making it effectively a tiny splash wall for anyone behind them."
splatoon,3dz004,kalespr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"I've seen that be used before, and I find it pretty good. It ain't no splash wall though."

splatoon,3dz004,xNotMyRealNameX,6,Tue Jul 21 08:08:56 2015 UTC,"Sprinklers can be dangerous if left unchecked, so you can't really blame people for taking them out. They do damage like a Splattershot, and if you need to pass through you have to take it out. Still, it can be good as bait, and I've fallen for it before."
splatoon,3dz004,Whelt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"You can't just leave them there, but it's best to assume it's a trap.  I'm always very cautious when I try to take out a sprinkler.  When I place sprinklers I put them somewhere that they can be hit, but not too easily.  I want my opponent to have to look up and preferably away from me to get it."
splatoon,3dz004,mikeraglow,6,Tue Jul 21 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"As an inkbrush user with stealth squid, this strategy never fails on ranked maps with dual splatzones.  Just toss a sprinkler in a blatantly obvious place, sneak up on them while they try to destroy it, then SPLAT.    It's even more hilarious when it works on the same person.  They know I'm hiding somewhere in my ink, but they can't let the sprinkler go unadressed as it covers the splatzones.  You'd think they'd first ink me out of the my hiding place first, then address the sprinkler.  But I'm not complaining."
splatoon,3dz004,McMeaty,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"If they're using a short range weapon, they must feel terrible since they can't take it out from afar and save themselves the risk."
splatoon,3dz004,Iinneus,5,Tue Jul 21 02:59:24 2015 UTC,Yea Judd says this in-game. Which makes me feel so much worse when i fall for it.
splatoon,3dz004,Dan_Ugore,4,Mon Jul 20 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"I totally fell for a sprinkler trap, which was shameful as someone who uses sprinklers.

splatoon,3dz004,CronVirus,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"I doubt Nintendo was unaware of this tactic.  Also, this tactic, much like the seeker, isn't as effective anymore once you reach B+/A-. It's still a good way to distract opponents though. The other downside of this tactic is that the sprinkler often consumes so much ink, that you don't have enough left to defeat your direct opponent."
splatoon,3dz004,Huawij,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're unaware, just that the primary concept was probably hiding. It's good for both.   And yeah I'm also assuming it's like hiding in the walls, a reliable gotcha in lower modes but the clever kids and serious players don't fall for cheap tricks."
splatoon,3dz004,Huawij,5,Mon Jul 20 22:19:57 2015 UTC,"The problem with hiding in walls is that you're not really hiding... People can see you ""hiding""."

splatoon,3dz004,ailes_grises,3,Mon Jul 20 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"I believe this is due to the idea that when using a Sprinkler you want to maximise your ink coverage, so you will move to a different spot while the Sprinkler takes care of wherever you placed it. So when someone else comes across your Sprinkler they will think you have already left to ink a different area, leaving them slightly defenceless as they attempt to take it out.  It's still a good strategy, just thought I'd give some input on the reasons why it works I guess..."

splatoon,3dz004,Iinneus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:52 2015 UTC,"I think throwing them in really inconvenient places works incredibly well. Like there are these orange-and-black dartboard-like structures in the upper corners of certain parts of urchin under pass where people people NEED to turn their backs on all the open space around them in order to destroy them.

splatoon,3dz004,Mr_Phishfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:48 2015 UTC,"Makes a decent shield too if you're at maximum ink. Throw one just in front and you'll have bought yourself maybe 0.5 seconds of extra time to splat the guy. Saved me a bunch of times.  At the higher ranks players love hiding in the ink to surprise you so its always best to throw them on a patch of turf that would give you the most advantage. They will have to make a decision whether to reveal themselves to destroy the sprinkler and then you, or retreat to maintain their stealth. Works great around corners where a roller may be lurking."

splatoon,3e1x6g,oonniioonn,4,Tue Jul 21 12:12:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, in the amount of time it takes to beat single player again (for the weapon unlocks) and reach level 20 its best you just risk your rank. If you're good enough for that rank anyway you'll work your way back up, if you get good with those new weapons you'll work your way back up.  If it was luck you ended up in A- but your skill level is really around B+ and B then it's not bad to be where you should be. You'll eventually get better with more experience and progress up."
splatoon,3e1x6g,Mr_Phishfood,3,Tue Jul 21 12:13:59 2015 UTC,"After rising and falling enough times, I think I can say, just go for it in ranked. If you're not playing when you want to out of fear of losing rank, you're only limiting your own enjoyment of the game.   Splatoon's ranking system is far from perfect, but generally, you will gravitate toward the rank you belong in. If you can't maintain a rank when you reach it, you're probably not ready to stay there yet.  Trying out new weapons is expanding your knowledge of the game, and that can only be a good thing, even if you lose more when trying to get the fundamentals down. You'll become a better player for it in the long run. My success rate went a lot higher once I started learning how to use weapons of different classes. Even then, I have room to learn more, as I still never touch chargers or blasters.  If you're significantly better with your main weapon, you can always switch back to that when you want to rise back up. I like to trade off, use my main weapons for a while, then try one I don't have as much experience with for a few games. Sometimes I even still win when doing that."
splatoon,3e1x6g,Whelt,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:59 2015 UTC,Know what you limit is with your best weapon. i.e. you are A+99 You switch to new weapon and lose to A+30. But you know that you can win more times than you lose with your best weapon so switch back to it to get back to A+99. Then try the new weapon again.  Although this is kind of crap since you doing poorly also hinders your team.

splatoon,3e1x6g,Summerlycoris,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:10 2015 UTC,"If you tend to win more than 50% of matches you will easily keep or regain your A- rank, so don't worry about it, let your rank be a bit more fluid and have fun playing a variety of set ups."
splatoon,3e1x6g,HikiDragon,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:08 2015 UTC,Just keep playing ranked.  Climbing doesn't take long if you are winning and the more you play the more you win.  Even if you fall a few ranks you will get back up eventually and you'll be better (and richer) for it.

splatoon,3e1x6g,EggheadDash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:34 2015 UTC,"Not really great because you'll wanting to test the weapons on tower control, splat zones and with the appropriately skilled opponents."
splatoon,3e1x6g,Mr_Phishfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:03 2015 UTC,I would just risk it if you go down in rank so what you can always get it back and probably easier then grinding a whole new account anyways. I would say try out weapons in regular turf wars and if your doing good move on to ranked with it.
splatoon,3dzl9d,mothernaturer,5,Mon Jul 20 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"Hey hi hello, art teacher and general Marie supporter here.   A couple of things:   So, her little dog bowl she wears on her head (seriously what is that)...whenever you draw a cylinder (or in this case a truncated cone, but same deal), you want the bottom curve to be a little deeper than the top curve. I've never had to explain this without having an easel behind me on which I can demonstrate, so I hope that's clear.  Take a closer look at her pointer finger and the way it joins the rest of her hand...it doesn't quite look like it connects. Based on the thumb I assume you're drawing from a screenshot (that thumb is a COMPLICATED-ASS foreshortening problem, by the way, and you handled it well). If I'm right about that, you may want to try gridding it out. If I'm wrong and this is all coming out of your head, see if you can get somebody to hold up their hand like that for you so you can take a quick picture to work from.  I am not usually a fan of Disney princess proportions, but I think she could benefit from just a little bit more neck. I think you can create the illusion of a longer neck by thinning it juuuuust a tiny bit without having to redraw too much.    Sorry for a mild wall of text, I hope it didn't come across as discouraging!"

If your goal here is to learn, doing just the upper body is going to hamper you, use the whole body feet and all.  Hop in front of your bathroom mirror and photograph your hands, or draw'm there like a nut.

I can also say that if there is a tie in overtime for like 10 seconds, the team that was catching up will get a +1 to their score (they lose progress) so the other team wins.  Did overtime happen for like ten seconds and then decide a winner? It might really be 5 seconds, but adrenaline is rushing in overtime for me, so it feels like 10 seconds..."
splatoon,3e0mr5,Iinneus,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Neither team was ever in control of both sides, there were times where one team lost control of a zone, but always got it back before the other team could.

You just need An SD card with enough room to hold the system and save data from the source system and of course a Wii U and Game pad.  If I read it right you can transfer your account and  ID to the new Wii U that you will purchase. This will delete the account and info of said account from the source wii u and wipe all contents of the target wii u.  I'm doing the same thing with my Brother hogging his Wii U but he's gonna be moving into my house so I don't have to go spend 300$. Hoping that a new Splatoon will be release with the new system that's rumored to be announced and possibly released 2016 when he does moves out so I can get my fix.

splatoon,3e0z7z,ScionVyse,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:48 2015 UTC,"Possibly, actually. I'm not 100% sure on transferring between systems, but it might be worth a try to transfer the game's save data to a USB stick, then plug that into your Wii U. I say this as I had my save data on a USB stick, but forgot to plug it in one day after moving the Wii U, and the save data was gone. Plugging it back in brought the save data back. I don't know if the stick will need to format between systems though, or if it's purely for the architecture/format.  That's just a thought though, I don't have a concrete answer, just a suggestion."
splatoon,3e0z7z,Poksonkirmar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"He'll need to 'cut' as opposed to 'copy' all the save data, if it works that way. On the 3DS, if you copy save data from one SD card to another the data doesn't work on the one with the copies, so i figure it's the same on wii u."
splatoon,3e0z7z,bustedradio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"you can try transferring via USB drive, but you would have to delete your NNID on your friend's WiiU and transfer it to your own WiiU.  depending where you live, you will have to call customer service to do that. just make sure to have the serial number for your friend's WiiU.  i've been told that you can't transfer saves between systems though. not sure if the save is tied to the system or the NNID. i've never tried it myself, so i can't give you a concrete answer."

The good news is that Nintendo (Japan) is doing a re-print of the Splatoon amiibo since they sold out stupidly fast. They confirmed they'll be doing a re-run of the Squid amiibo, but they won't be selling the 3-pack again.  I'm sure the squid will still be uncommon at best, but the upside is you can probably import a retail copy of it if they don't make their way to the west."

There's a very little bit of wiggle if you shake the thing, but I was impressed at how well it stands up - there's no need to brace it or stick paper in the holes or whatever.  As for the paint job, it's really impressive as well. The color of the ink matches the amiibo pretty well, and it's nice & glossy without any spots / gaps / etc. Also, the lettering on the back looks ""burned"" in - but it's a nice, even, bold black throughout."

splatoon,3dyi2o,chuzoley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"See I don't get this, there is a place in my town selling the three Splatoon amiibos for around. Fifty bucks or seventeen dollars each.  And there's a tonne of them, are they really that rare?"
splatoon,3dyi2o,bloodborneAddict,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"They are, actually!  The three-pack (the only way to get the squid amiibo at current) is completely sold out - so, if they have a ton of them on hand it's likely that they snatched them up with the expectation of reselling. The Inkling Girl & Boy are also both pretty rare as well, and $17/each actually isn't a terrible price over what they're currently going for via resellers ($25 & $30, resp.)  The thing is, their prices will drop once the next run is produced - and Nintendo's already confirmed another run for Japan. It would be silly for them not to do another run for the US - given that Splatoon's sold more in the Americas than in Japan - but nothing's been confirmed there yet.  My advice, if you're interested in them, is to wait a bit and don't pay more than $15-$16/each if you can't."

Again this place has a fucktonne of them, If people are really this desperate to get them at a reasonable price I could probably arrange to buy a bunch and sell them to people who ask.  From what I've heard scalpers have been making it impossible to get these things for a reasonable price I could probably arrange to sell these for cheaper if people on this reddit are desperate enough."

Rollers are the actual problem, just try paying attention to where they are, if you spot them before the reach you, try getting around them and hitting them from the side or behind.

You can also fight fire with fire, use a roller or blaster if you really really want to beat them."

splatoon,3dzkfl,Huawij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"Your weapons of choice all outrange rollers and blasters (except for maybe the dynamo roller), so it's not an impossible task.  Could you tell us more about your current playstyle? How do you tackle blasters and rollers right now? If you aren't already: be inconspicuous. Blasters can be easily taken care of by sneaking up on them from behind or above. The same goes for rollers, but they're more dangerous when you're up close."
splatoon,3dzkfl,Huawij,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:52 2015 UTC,"I try to get away or keep my space. Usually they just fucking sneak up to me or I'm going up somewhere and get caught by them.  I tend to run forward and stay in the action, sometimes stay back though."
splatoon,3dzkfl,kodi_68,5,Mon Jul 20 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"Try to move around more cautiously. A lot of players like to wait around corners or hide in their ink to splat you by surprise (after all, it's a successful strategy). If you know the enemy is behind the corner, try to take a different route and catch them by surprise. If you aren't sure, use long-range attacks to gauge the situation. The tentatek has sticky bombs, right? Throw it right at the corner (on the wall). Either you will take the opponent by surprise and splat them, or you will force them to move away form the corner. Move in right after the bomb exploded, and the opponent won't have enough time to move back to their spot right around the corner. The kelp splatterscope has splat bombs right? Send a a splat bomb or to around the corner to force the opponent to retreat. I don't recall the dual squelcher's sub (squid beakon?), but try to use its great range to outrange opponents.   The key is to pick your battles wisely. It's much better to retreat to a more favorable position, to take the long way around or to be patient than it is to rush in like some kind of rambo (I never saw the movies, I hope I used it correctly) and get splatted immediately after. Unless it's the end of the match and you're already losing, in which case you have to take some risks (you've got nothing to lose anyway). However, you will want to avoid such situations in the first place.  If you're playing tower control, then using a blaster is an easy (or cheap) way to kill opponents quickly. Just fire at the tower and you should be able to kill opponents in 1-2 hits. The lunar blaster's ink mine is a great way to take revenge on someone who jumped on the tower and killed you (place the mine on the tower beforehand and the mine will often kill whoever killed you). There's another blaster that has a bubbler, which is a great way to gain some distance when you're in enemy territory. Just activate the bubbler while on the tower, and try to stay on. Your allies will move towards you to collect the bubbler, and then proceed to take out opponents threatening to push you off the tower. I lost a bunch of matches in overtime because of this strategy. I don't recall the subs and specials of the other blasters, so my advice ends here."

splatoon,3dzkfl,Huawij,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like you're playing too aggressively and carelessly and it is the close ranged weapons who have just respawned several seconds ago and are rushing back into the map that get you.  The advice to play a little more conservatively is one I'll echo. You always want escape routes and to be able to swim away from someone who might try to get the jump on you.
splatoon,3dzkfl,thefreightrain,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"You always want escape routes and to be able to swim away from someone who might try to get the jump on you.   I want to stress the importance of this. If you decide to go to some place in the map, make sure there's enough ink down there to stealth around or to escape if necessary. If there is not enough ink: lay down some ink until there's enough.  For instance, if the center area of urchin underpass is completely filled with enemy ink, don't just charge right through. There's a good chance opponents are hiding in the ink, ready to splat impatient people like you. Lay down some ink first, to reveal opponents and draw them out, as well as creating space for you to move around in."
splatoon,3dzkfl,thefreightrain,11,Tue Jul 21 08:19:28 2015 UTC,"Blasters, minus the Luna Blaster, are dramatically crippled when you run up into their face for a firefight. With the Luna, keep your distance.  Rollers suffer when they don't have a lot of their own ink to work with, so inking the ground when you're not contested is critical. The exception may be the Dynamo, but try and take cover or sneak up on them just after they've catapulted their ink.  Kraken Rollers are going to be eternally dangerous and annoying, but your best bet either way is to either keep backing up while constantly firing if you have the ink and a good enough gun. Otherwise, take to fleeing. There's a few different ways to flee: you can straight up swim away, you can do what I like to do and after a brief run slow to half speed or stop (so they can't follow your trail), or you can jump and bounce around if you're good enough to keep their focus on you. The last option takes practice, but it's not a bad choice, as you effectively make them spend their Kraken going after you while ignoring your teammates, and not moving from their position.  Finally, play Turf Wars some, in case you're not now. Ranked mode is more of an ""objective"" mode, and forces confrontation, but you'll also rarely encounter higher skilled players. I've learned things in Turf Wars from such players, as odd as it seems to say so. I'm not saying exclusively play Turf Wars, but use it as a warm up arena and practice."

Here's a VOD from UglyPieceofBread, a streamer I typically watch VODs of and is a very high level player (he streams while I'm asleep typically). Alternatively, look up ZackScottGaming for low level play. Why would you want to watch low level play? Well, it gives an appreciation for the skills you have, and you get an eye for what he's doing wrong after a time, and that's something you can start applying to your own play after a time.  I know, lots of footage watching Splatoon rather than playing, but hey, it's an alternative to experiencing these types of players while playing, plus gives a bit of insight into their own play.

splatoon,3dzkfl,Acterian,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Get good at throwing suction bombs w tentetek at the tower constantly in tower control and reap the rewards. I've only been playing for 2 weeks and made it to A+ this way. If I play splat zones I drop back down to A-/B+.   You also have to play the role of hopping on and off the tower (while still constantly sticking suction bombs to it) using it as a shield as your team pushes staying alive for your team mates to super jump to you remember you don't have to get the tower all the way to the base just have the best score after 5 minutes so if you get a good push don't hesitate to play defensively and just cluster fkuck the tower with suction bombs it works.   Can't say it enough constantly throw suction bombs at the tower even if your staying behind it while a team mate is riding it pushing into enemy territory I use ink saver main, sub saver, ninja, and some ink recovery ups  EDIT: forgot to mention jumping while swimming then throwing gives you better distance on your suction bombs throws as well if you didn't already know   PS don't tell too many people if you read this it's a secret that still works for me :)"

splatoon,3dzkfl,killthewolf,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I recommend switching your weapons.  Tentatek Splattershot is possibly the best weapon in the game, but the bombs on a regular Splatterscope are amazing in close combat and Splattershot Pro totally outclasses the dual squelcher.  General Tips  1) keep the area around you inked.  Whenever you aren't in immediate peril start inking the area around you while looking at the minimap.  Its very hard to be aggressive when the entire battlefield is the enemy's color of ink so when you are defending that should be your first priority.  2) Don't be afraid to lie in wait.  Even if it takes awhile one good play is worth a whole game of bad plays.  Find spots people rarely ink but often run past and lurk there, if you are on the offensive take it slow when you are unsure.  I often see people die repeatedly because they want to get back into the fray as fast as possible.  3) Optimize your gear.  Head slot is free but you should have Ninja-Squid/Cold-Blooded and Ink-Resistance/Stealth Jump whenever you are in ranked.  Don't put yourself at a disadvantage unless you really think you can win without them.  How to deal with Blasters:  1) Don't stay near entrances where people are likely to shoot from.  You only have two health versus a blaster and its important not to lose one to poor positioning.  You should never attack anyone head on unless you outrange them, but this holds especially true against blasters.  2) Know their dead zones.  Luna blaster can be outranged by a lot of weapons so you try and pick them off from a distance.  Regular blasters have a significant dead zone near them where if they don't land a direct hit they can't hurt you so get close to them and keep moving.  How to deal with (basic) Rollers  1) Backpedal.  Roller flick damage is much less potent at larger ranges so as soon as you engage a roller you want to focus on keeping a healthy space between the two of you.  2) Learn to approach.  If you need to push forward and there may be rollers around try not to give your position away.  Ink a large area for yourself to potentially move in and don't stay out of squid form too long until you know you are safe.  If a roller catches you by surprise it is your own fault and you are probably going to die for it.  3) Limit their approach.  Rollers want to get up close and personal with you so make sure they can't do it quietly.  Always try to keep the ground around you in every direction inked and swing your camera around whenever you have the opportunity to so that you aren't being flanked.  Rollers are pretty worthless at medium range so all your strategies should be about keeping them here.  4) Avoid Kraken.  When you see a kraken you want to immediately squid form, back up, and then hide in that order.  Kraken's suck at covering ink so if you can successfully make it lose your scent the other player has become worthless for 6 seconds rather than gaining an advantage.  If you are brave you can even trail behind them and splat them as the timer runs out, try to count in your head whenever you see one (mind you some people take special duration up so account for that!)"
splatoon,3dzkfl,Mr_Phishfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"Another general tip: use the walls. If I'm rollering, I often use the walls to hide and splat people coming.

splatoon,3dzkfl,fatuousEpithet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"Check this post: Weapon Range Chart  The regular blaster has a sweet spot where its dangerous. If you got a long range weapon then of course you can outrange it, be mindful, don't just try to shoot at them, but after they make a shot try to cut off the path they've made with their ink to slow their progress and give you more opportunity to shoot them.  If you have a weapon that is short range rapid fire weapon that is nearing the blasters danger zone then do the opposite, get in really really close. Below the danger zone the fire rate on the blaster makes it really difficult to kill you, so you'll need to try circling them while shooting.  Rollers. They hide in ink. Its what they are supposed to do. Are you using weapons with any of these sub weapons: sprinkler, splat bomb, suction bomb, point sensor, disruptor, splash wall. IF you are they you are not using them effectively to clear a dangerous patch of ink.  Know this, ranked modes are very kill focused. So after a string of defeats this will have an impact on your confidence and will also make you play more defensively but ranked modes are all about offense and so playing defensively will make you a hindrance to your team. The scoreboard at the end may show that you gave as good as you got but what it doesn't show is that you didn't contribute to the objective."

splatoon,3dzkfl,Biceps_Inc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"rollers are easy to deal with. if one of them is dumb enough to roll up to you head on, then you can out range and splat them. the only exception is the carbon roller, it's pretty fast and are have the quickest time to kill at point blank. if you can't deal with them head on, circle strafe and attack them from the side.  the roller's hit box is huge, if any part of your body hits any part of  the roller, it's a OHKO, unless it's a carbon, then it's a 2HKO.    most people who play rollers are either like to play stealthily or like to flank, or both. just be aware of your surroundings and ink the area around you. rollers will travel around and hide in their ink when they get the chance.  a good way to flush out a hiding roller is to throw a bomb or sprinkler.   for blasters, OHKO comes mainly from the burst of ink at the end of their range. what you want to do is to get in their face. you can survive getting hit by the trail of ink before the blast. if you don't want to fight them head on, then circle strafe and lay down a trap like a mine or a suction bomb.  if you think you're in trouble, run away. there's nothing wrong with running away and then making a comeback. it's better than wasting a few seconds respawning and swimming back into the action."

It is all about being able to kite your opponent and using obstacles to your advantage.  The blast radius on the luna is ridiculous so it is really good at hitting people around corners.

The Squiffer is a charger with shortest range, which makes people question why you would use it over a long range shooter or a charger with even better range.  The Rapid Blaster has the best range out of any blaster, yet it lacks the OHKO that most people use the blasters for.

Here's what I love about it:   The key to this weapon is spacing.  In some other thread a few days back, someone compared the rapid blaster to using Marth's tipper in Smash Bros.  With that spacing, the rapid blaster can fish people out of their sniper nests at a safer distance than other blasters.   When I am holding down a high traffic choke point, I like to lay down a mine, hide, and then shoot people as they cross the mine.  Usually mines can be escaped by charging through, but the rapid blaster will stop them just enough to get the kill.   The longer distance blast is great to support a teammate who is gunning down someone.  It's like tossing in a longer range and more ink efficient burst bomb You can rush the middle super fucking fast with this thing.  It might not quite beat an inkbrush, but I'll get there in barely more time but with more ink in my tank.  Of course, it's not the best in a 1v2+ situation, but especially in a ranked mode where getting to the middle is more of everyone's priority, your teammates have hopefully followed your path   This is one of my go-to weapons, but it might get replaced by the rapid blaster pro deco once that comes out.  I'll have to wait and see what the trade off is for better range, but it'll have a disruptor on it and I can't wait"

If I jump, which is rare, would be if my teammate is some place advantageous or it's the end of the game.   Beacons are a waste of a sub because hardly anyone uses them, and the enemy just destroys them fast. As soon as I see an enemy beacon on my game pad that's the first place I go. Or I just nuke it.   I try to stay as far away from people as I can and just splat the ground for turf war because that's the object to win the game.

Toward the very end of the timer, my team had the tower on the final straight stretch to the enemy base. Two of my teammates died, so I hurried over to help the remaining guy push the tower home. On my way, I inked just enough turf to fill up my special bar for a Killer Wail. The guy on the tower died, and the enemy team took it over with three guys riding and a sniper standing on their base. I hit my Killer Wail and killed all four of them at once. Then I hopped on the tower and rode it in for the win. Honestly, I've never done as well in Tower Control since, so it was probably dumb luck, but it felt great at the time. :P"

It was tower control on underpass so there is a lot of potential for kills in those tight corridors but it still felt awesome.  My favorite moment was when I got a triple kill with one shot on a tightly clustered group of squidkids that I had softened up with a previous shot.  Luna blaster is the best!

But in a stroke of luck, a majority of the enemy team had died, and we took the tower just as the game went into overtime.  I knew my team wouldn't be able to do it. Anyone who wasn't on the tower was on the heels of it, ready to hop on at all times. Given how clustered my team was, they could all be splatted by a single bomb.  And they were also close enough to share a bubbler with the entire team.  I did exactly that as soon as the other team hit us head on and we quad killed them. By the time they got to us, we had already passed the one point threshold and took the game.  Best comeback of my Splatoon experience."

splatoon,3dz3fa,Pacman1up,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:17 2015 UTC,No.  As you leave your spawn point turn towards the middle and follow the raised path that leads to the lowest platform.  The central path that connects the lowest section to the lifts and loops around each side to the top of the lifts.  The path right between both sides raised paths that the opposite team cannot access.

I exited from the far right to immediately get a backstab on their Squelcher, then found a guy in a stalemate with one of my teammates who immediately spotted me and tried to run up the middle platform, but I saw through his maneuver and splatted him before he reached the top. By then my teammate had already inked a path for me to swim, and I notice two enemies on their flanking side. I took one of them out and the other decided to retreat to the corner and ambush me. I saw through the ambush and splatted him/her before any retaliation.  That maneuver bought my team so much time to get into position that the enemy team was unable to take back the zone once, even with Inkstrike. Although, I did get splatted later on and ended the match with 4/1. On that high note I reached A- for the third, and hopefully last, time."

Saltspray Rig, see enemy near middle, guy sets up ink wall next to a wall near the edge and tries to splat from behind, I jump around the wall and take him out.

splatoon,3dz3fa,multiman000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"Today in Moray Towers  I was making my way up  the enemy's side when two people dropped down and started assaulting me. One of them krakened and started chasing me, so I dropped down to the lower level. I ran up and splatted a charger who was camping the center whilst still running away from the kraken (who had jumped down after me.) I turned and started making my way back up to the spot where I was originally attacked and I saw the other guy who was shooting at me before. I pulled off some feint-like maneuver and ended up right behind him. After I splatted him, the kraken quickly made its way up to me. But right when the guy was about to attack, he dekrakened and went straight through me. Immediately after this, he attacked with his inkbrush (which failed to harm me because then I was right behind him XD). As he was caught up attacking the empty space in front of him, I splatted him and got away safely."

splatoon,3dz3fa,disgruntledpenguins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"Using a dynamo roller I was defending the top area of Saltspray Rig, while another teammate inked the top.  Three opposing team members were all making a B-line to the top and I didn't have my special yet, so I dove in my ink around the big rubber bumper while the three enemies walked past to get at my teammate.  Just as they past me they grouped together, I took my chance, surprised them, and got my first 3-kill splat with my carbon roller.  It was the highlight of my night."
splatoon,3dz3fa,chainedlove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"I remember the most dickish thing I did. It was 3v1 splatfest match on Saltspray, and we had him cornered in the spawn zone. I hid on top of the narrow ledging that makes up the fencing/gate to the central area. He had a roller and FINALLY had made it out of the spawn area without being insta-splatted, so I waited until he almost got all the way up the ramp leading to the center before making a showy, unnecessary leap and splashing him with my own Krak-on before I even hit the ground. I can't even imagine how pissed off I would be if I were in his shoes, but I couldn't not do it."

It's a weapon you really feel and instinctively react with, more so than the longer range chargers because you're in the heat of the action. It's an amazing weapon by the way, definitely top 5 in both Turf Wars and Ranked.  Tip: Don't jump approach a Squiffer squid; you'll get an extra tenth of a second survival time as you ascend but when you reach the peak and hang in the air they will hit you. Get in the ink and weave / strafe."

splatoon,3e1lus,LillePingle,2,Tue Jul 21 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"That is understandable, I think the reasoning behind it is they want the people who play alone to not get frustrated playing against 4 friends while all their allies are loner randoms with no communication.

The wifi where I'm now living is pretty unstable (I'd say one d/c every 1-2 hours), but I don't really notice it while playing splatoon. I'd be logged out of skype, but splatoon would play fine. I only lag or d/c rarely, but I think when I do it's because someone in the lobby has a shitty connection (apparently splatoon is peer-to-peer).

splatoon,3dzm11,Zenku390,6,Mon Jul 20 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"Both. I primarily use the gyro controls, but sometimes I'll use the stick to look around when I'm hiding in my ink, or to ""calibrate"" the controls. For instance, if I move forward and I want to make a right turn, it's easier to use the sticks to move your character and readjust the camera than it is to sit sideways on your chair. The gyro controls are perfect if you need to readjust the camera/aim quickly. The Wii U has really good gyro controls; I suggest using it for other games too."
splatoon,3dzm11,Huawij,5,Mon Jul 20 20:40:44 2015 UTC,He means Gyro or Dual sticks without gyro. Gyro controls by default make you need to look left and right with the stick and then adjust with the pad. Dual stick just ignores the pad input completely. You cannot switch between the two modes dynamically outside the firing range.
splatoon,3dzm11,squaswin,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:18 2015 UTC,"I know, but I wanted to emphasize that, even though I primarily use the gamepad's gyro controls, I still use the stick to readjust the camera occasionally. I don't want the OP to get the impression that I completely ignore the stick (that would make for some uncomfortable playing)."
splatoon,3dzm11,Huawij,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"Wow. that would be horrible to use. Trying to play with just the gyro and the Y button *shudder* or even just the gyro, that would be horrible."
splatoon,3dzm11,squaswin,4,Mon Jul 20 21:10:16 2015 UTC,I've stopped using the Y button. I tried it a couple of times because someone said it's a great way to do a near-180 turn. The problem with the Y button is that it recalibrates (i.e. fucks up) your gyro controls.
splatoon,3dzm11,Huawij,4,Mon Jul 20 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"That is the only reason I use the Y button. If I feel my gyro is off or uncomfortable, I'll use the Y button, but without using the stick or contorting your body in unnatural ways, the Y button is the only real way to change your camera directions."

Jumping while aiming your sub weapon is also possible with motion. Getting a little extra distance can be helpful.  The dead zone on the analog stick definitely hampers your ability to make fine adjustments. When you're unsure of your targets movements. Especially when you're on high ground with a charger weapon.  Plus motion controls afford you dual sensitivity. Fast rotation with the analog stick and fine tuning with motion. With the analog stick only, you are locked in to a single sensitivity where you are trading speed for finesse and vice versa."
splatoon,3dzm11,Mr_Phishfood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"Please re-read my previous comment properly.  The dead zone doesn't hamper precision because, believe it or not, people can learn. Just as people adapt to the lack of a dead zone with the motion controls.  You're also getting two different things mixed up. The act of jumping or swimming and jumping to increase range or height on something and the technique of jump shooting which is basically bunny hopping."

You have fractions of a second and you lose fractions of those fractions of a second to the dead zone. So for the sake of OP and making your argument for sticks clear, please explain how a player would overcome the hardware limitation of the dead zone when your enemy is moving and diving and jumping all over the place?  Jumping or swimming and jumping, bunny hopping. What difference does it make? can you hold the jump button or repeatedly tap the button while fluidly aiming at the same time without motion controls?  Someone sends a seeker your way, you don't have enough ink to move around it, they are likely swimming in the seekers ink path to get closer to you. Your only choice, you hold that jump button to jump over the seeker while aiming down at the ink trail. No way you can do that with sticks."

Just if you plan on using gyro controls don't make the mistakes I do, or you'll be stuck looking for fast-firing wide range weapons in order to compensate for bad aim haha.

A few weeks ago I decided to give them another try after hearing everyone singing their praises... and promptly recoiled in disgust at the motion controls. They work for some people, but they're not the untouchable pinnacle of game control that some people tout them as being. I've done pretty well with just dual-stick, as has my friend, so don't feel obligated to use motion controls if you're more comfortable with just the sticks. I've had very few moments where I've wished I were using motion controls, but at the end of the day I much prefer sticks. The only problem I really have is having trouble centering my reticle exactly on my enemy but that seems like it would still pose an issue even using the gyroscope."

I can't use the Gyro controls, since my hands/wrists get incredibly twitchy, and end up screwing my aim. It's also why I'm garbage at M+KB controls on PC shooters. Anyways, just use what makes you happy, and be the best at it that you can be!"
splatoon,3dzm11,Kittari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"Both. Using the stick is good for looking around corners and looking at your surroundings. Gyro is great for making snap shots and fixing your aim at the enemy. Both control types have their ups and downs.   If you just like to ink, then stick only controls is fine, just make sure to be aware of your surroundings. If you like to splat people, having gyro control is great, but stick control is still good, just make sure to adjust the sensitivity."

With twinsticks it's 1) Move your thumb where you want the crosshairs to be, 2) Wait until the crosshairs are there.   It may not sound like much when you're used to the sticks, have the sensitivity maxed and are skilled enough not to overshoot the target, but many people who use a keyboard look at twinsticks the way vampires look at garlic. As minor as it is, those split seconds count in online shooters. That's why people praise the gyro. it brings console gaming one step closer to the accuracy of a mouse and keyboard. Though admittedly its an uncomfortable shift for twinsticks users. Give it time. Once you're used to it you'll hate all other shooters forever!"

splatoon,3e1dkb,Dylthenoise,2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:26 2015 UTC,"This is because you were probably playing in the same style as you were when playing with sticks without taking advantages the gyro affords you.  Have you ever stood on a really high platform or tried shooting someone on a high platform? Extreme low and high angle shots are more difficult with sticks due to people moving forwards, backwards, left and right. The dead zone on the analog stick forces you to lose precious fractions of a second to readjust your aim, not so with gyro.  As you've already said, jumping and shooting is much easier since you can keep your crosshairs locked on your target while you are jumping.  The gyro affords you dual sensitivity. I personally have the camera sensitivity on 3.5. I make large sweeping movements with the camera and fine adjustments with the gyro. With sticks you have a single sensitivity and you have to try and find a balance between speed and finesse. Something I often see among the higher ranked players using quick short range weapons is to pop up in front of someone, couple of quick shots, swim behind them and accurately hit them in the back, something dual sensitivity affords them.  Using just the sticks isn't bad, but gyro gives you options you didn't have before."

splatoon,3e2xpi,Corne777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:59 2015 UTC,That's because you need to ink turf to stand on it. Rushing the tower while the other team is alive will more than likely get you killed.   Also they might be charging their special to have a bigger effect on the middle battle for the tower. In ranked I often throw some ink on uninked turf on the way back to the battle so I can have a special when I get there.

splatoon,3e2xpi,Whelt,3,Tue Jul 21 16:25:03 2015 UTC,"Rough Google translate tells me that these are Japanese players complaining about players who always dash straight to the tower without cleaning up and securing the surrounding area first.  And they may have a point. It doesn't help to jump on the tower if the entire field is enemy ink and their whole team is ready to crush you when you ride in.  Tower Control is a lot about momentum. If you ride in for 10 points prematurely and they kill all of you, they can ride it for a lot longer and take your lead. High level Tower Control often consists of a huge battle around the tower with no one taking it until one of the teams is wiped out."

The two product-based Splatfests in Japan seem to be between a single company's two products.  Still though, I think it'd be fun, and interesting for the company in question. For example, we'd probably get something like Sprite vs. Fanta, or something. Either way, Coke wouldn't have anything to lose, and we all get to have fun Splatting eachother defending our favorite soda.

splatoon,3e09uc,Mr_Phishfood,3,Tue Jul 21 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Correct usage of subweapons can clear a dangerous choke point, but this is kind of useless unless your whole team is on board with the idea.  Generally you've been outclassed as a team if the enemy has been able to get that close to you because all the levels have been setup in such a way where anyone invading in to your side of the map has a disadvantage due to you having high ground."
splatoon,3e09uc,pbzeppelin1977,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:14:30 2015 UTC,You deserve to be spawn camped on Urchin Underpass if it happens.  The enemy has to follow an open and narrow path to get to your spawn point where as your team has lots of raised ground to stop them from as well as to sneak around and go to another part of the map.
splatoon,3e09uc,Kittari,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:57 2015 UTC,I suppose spawncamping isn't the correct term. The enemy team can push through you and guard the area outside your spawn. A couple of Octobrushes and a beakon placer and you have some trouble.

splatoon,3dxamu,OatmealDome,10,Mon Jul 20 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, it's a frustrating map. I've only played this map in Turf War. I wonder if it works better for other modes. Though at this point, if it's on rotation, I avoid whatever game mode has it.   Unlike most maps, there's a single chokepoint. I can only think of one other map like that - Arowana Mall - and that map seems far better designed. On Moray Towers, a good charger can completely shut down the other team. This is especially true if the other team has no chargers of its own, since the sniping locations are so far out of reach. Sniping locations should be powerful positions, but dangerous to hold. And if you're playing as a close-range loadout, you're screwed. Once one team establishes firm control of the center, the game is basically over.   I think the map either needs a route that doesn't go through the middle or it needs more (I mean some) cover in the middle. There needs to be a way to harass the chargers without just being a charger yourself. If they just raised that center section (made those final ramps less steep), it would make it far easier for players to toss bombs up to where the chargers hang out. Or the matchmaking needs to make sure that the teams have an even number of chargers, since they are so powerful on this map.   By comparison, the center in Arowana Mall typically changes hands  constantly. I attribute that to the fact that it's so small, that you can get through it in a second or so, that it has cover, and that the sniper perches are not at all safe (players can potentially assault from three different directions)."
splatoon,3dxamu,balefrost,9,Mon Jul 20 13:24:07 2015 UTC,"it would be my least favorite too, but Arowana Mall exists."
splatoon,3dxamu,tryagainbooboo,13,Mon Jul 20 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one who hates it.  I personally think it has a terrible chokepoint that's far too easily locked down by chargers, of which they're too high above you to even fight back with the Inkzooka most of the time, let alone bomb throws to flush them out.  This is in addition to there being no cover down below to sneak up on them either.  If there was a side route that let you bypass the middle, I think it would be better.  This could just be my general hatred of chargers though.  Not necessarily a big fan of one-hit kills in this game for some reason."
splatoon,3dxamu,ZorkNemesis,6,Mon Jul 20 10:28:27 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to rant about chargers for a while now; I feel they're against the fast-paced spirit of the game and are a detriment to the whole experience because of it. It's not fun to be locked down by a single, nigh untouchable player. Yes, it's strategically sound and makes sense in war games... but this isn't a war game. I routinely see Chargers with either no points at all and maybe 1 or 2 splats or with 10 splats, 1 or 2 deaths and also barely any points. This isn't CS or CoD or whatever, you're playing a painting simulator.  I don't feel it should be charging to instasplat either. The Squelcher line of weapons demonstrates that it's possible to have un-frustrating long-range weapons that still paint terrain well without feeling overpowered.  This all is exacerbated by the map layouts of the maps you mentioned and are my least favorite because of it. No way to deal with a line of weapons is just annoying. I typically try and flush them out with an Ink Strike but it's tricky to get enough Special charge if the opponents just fortify the chokepoint and do nothing else."
splatoon,3dxamu,NearNihil,4,Mon Jul 20 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"Playing as a charger is basically only for the masochistic. Its stacked against you in every way, it's just this map that makes them seem op"
splatoon,3dxamu,mgrandi,6,Mon Jul 20 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"And even the best charger players often won't walk away from matches with 1000+ points all the time. They seem way more suited to ranked battles, and even then, that's a game mode that's incredibly aggressive, so you better be a really good sniper if you want to use them.  I kind of like that concept of having to be really good to use them. When a charger kills me, I think ""You know what? You had to earn the skill to use that weapon."""
splatoon,3dxamu,Iinneus,3,Mon Jul 20 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"There sort of is, but it's not exactly easy to get to, and you can be easily spotted.

splatoon,3dxamu,moodRubicund,8,Mon Jul 20 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"No.  I think it's trash and I've hated it since release. I can't believe how poorly designed it is. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of what constitutes fun, and surely lots of people find this map fun, but objectively I feel that the design is flawed and it goes against the balanced trend that splatoon has taken in the past.  It's not bad on TC but sucks nuts on every other mode.  The map funnels everyone into a chokepoint surrounded by high ground. There is no way around the choke point and very few alternative routes onto the high points.   There are very few if any places to hide and make plays across the choke and onto their ramps. There are no alternative routes; all players are forced into the choke. This is honestly the ONLY map like this other than Arowana and the mall has many, many more ways to make plays, as well as lots of walls to hide and chargers are much more vulnerable. Every other map is designed specifically with alternative routes.   The complete high ground gives an astronomically huge advantage to chargers and rollers when there are almost no walls. Most other weapons have no way of fighting back unless you're 10x better than they are. Chargers are out of reach of basically all guns, unlike on Arowana, and because of the vertical nature of the map, there chargers have a clear view of everything and there are no places to hide or surprise attack.  Additionally, rollers do ridiculously well on this map, and everyone runs kraken, which is OP on this map as well given the narrow ramps. Krakens >>> everything else for breaking your opponents ramps, since there is literally no way to dodge or escape the Kraken other than falling back and conceding your zone.  Basically the TLDR to this is: 1. Funnels everyone into a choke point with no cover 2. Chargers and Rollers are objectively overpowered due to lack of counterplay from other weapons, 3. Ability to make plays extremely limited, skill is ultimately gimped, weapon RNG more likely to determine match outcome.  It's just crap and I hate playing when this map is on rotation. It's the only map I've seriously disliked."
splatoon,3dxamu,EqusG,3,Mon Jul 20 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with your assessment on the chargers, but Splat/Krak-on rollers aren't overpowered here. In fact they have a worse time as their lack of range and disadvantage at fighting above them limits their effectiveness. The kraken can generally be held off by one weapon with a higher fire rate, or in the case of a ramp defended by two people it can be stopped completely. I'd say those weapons with the bubbler are far more OP for breaking lines as even if they can't advance they are invulnerable, can pass that to team mates also taking the hill and can shoot the defenders with relative impunity. The kraken on the other hand has no ranged attack option and in the post patch state can't advance on a defended position directly at all."
splatoon,3dxamu,SocialDissent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:13 2015 UTC,"Not to mention rollers and paintbrushes can sit above the splat zone and spam flick and its near impossible to kill them  The e-liter can hit the enemy splat zone , and other snipers are practically useless, which sucks if you don't like the e-liter  One of the two routes is directly.into where the enemy drops down, and where the enemy sniper always sits  Long range guns, like the splattershot are pretty much king on this map, other shorter range guns like the  Jr, n zap guns are awful from what ive seen"
splatoon,3dxamu,mgrandi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:09:24 2015 UTC,This map is clearly designed with chargers in mind. I love chargers. I hate this map.  Splatoon just doesn't do vertical well at all because thirdperson.  Moray towers is shitloads of vertical. Nothing more needs to be said.

But during turf war, the action clogs at the choke point, there'sthis one annoying thing rollers do where they hang over a certain edge, splat, jump backwards and swim back up a wall to avoid damage at all, which is soooooo cheap and annoying.

Nobody makes any progress aside from just team deathmatch in the center area.  I do agree overall that the middle chokepoint is terribly designed.
splatoon,3dxamu,KtoL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% on this, I was shocked to see all the love for this map."
splatoon,3dxamu,ToastedEnder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"This map favors too much to specific weapons, and ink brushes are just useless. Rollers dominate the turf, and chargers control it. Anything else takes a lot of skill to make up for the disadvantage. and Inkbrushers are only good for covering a wide range of turf, and it's practically useless on the narrow path ways. And ink brushers dont have the range to control the center area. It almost forces you to play chargers or rollers. This is only for turf war, tower control it's worse. On the up side it looks pretty."
splatoon,3dxamu,UnionJames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:26 2015 UTC,I never play moray towers without an aerospray or a .96 for fear of chargers. I really want to paint roll down the slopes too :(
splatoon,3dxamu,80espiay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:43 2015 UTC,"It's not so good if you play with sticks instead of gyro, since you have to adjust your vertical view much more than on any other map."

splatoon,3dxamu,kodi_68,0,Mon Jul 20 10:29:50 2015 UTC,"Three words:  Long Charge Times.  If there's only one, and you miss me, I gotcha."
splatoon,3dxamu,kodi_68,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"If you hate this board it's because you're not adapting to it.  Wahhh.  Chargers! Wahhh.  Rollers!  Try a different setup.  Maybe a splash wall for advancing (.52G is great here).   Maybe learn to thrown bombs where they need to be and get your range up.  Even though people seem to hate the Rapid Blaster Deco, you can really clear some fools out with it on this board, especially because you can clear straight lines fast and have the sticky bombs and bomb rush.   Charge that thing up before you hit the choke and rain down bombs to clear a path to clear the perch.  I've had plenty of times on this map where a charger thought he could camp and take everyone out.   Until we split him up.  He can only fire to one side, so distract on the left, charge on the right, or vice versa.  On the left all you have to do is get off the ledge and get behind the lower wall and go up the side.   On the right you can jump and put a bomb up on the perch.   You might get splatted, but if you're paying attention and your team is, someone can get a rush going.     E-liters have the slowest charge time.   Wait for the shot and move."
splatoon,3dxamu,Justanotherbiomajor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a charger main, and honestly, Moray Tower is my worst map just because of the strategy you described. An E-Liter 3K can defend what has been gain and make a path for allies to climb to the first floor of the enemy's side. But that's about it. You're stuck to the supportive role for the most part and if your team can't capitalize on it, you're skewed. The moment the wall leading your way has been inked by the enemy (usually a Tentatek guy will throw a suction bomb at it to make sure you can't possibly do a quick repaint job with burst bombs), enemies start flowing in, and you get spattered like crazy. Trying to retake your side can take a while as the map is freaking huge. You can't just jump down to the first floor; you have to retake it starting on right, above the splat zone and make your way left toward the middle, otherwise you'll simply get ambushed by enemies going up the wall leading to the first floor."
splatoon,3dy526,KoopaStarRoad,5,Mon Jul 20 14:17:58 2015 UTC,"I always felt like the N-ZAP '85 did a better job than the Custom Splattershot Jr., and that the Echolocator didn't lend itself as well to a weapon with such short range, but with the addition of the Disruptor sub, it's definitely a good support weapon.  I think the Splattershot Jr. does not favor overly aggressive play. It's a supporting weapon, so you gotta really stay back. Preserve yourself so you can get more Echolocators, so that way your teammates can start mowing down the opponents. Once an Echolocator does go off, hunt them down and use your Disruptors in combat for some nice kills."
splatoon,3dy526,Iinneus,5,Mon Jul 20 16:19:57 2015 UTC,The custom splattershot jr is for less aggressive play that the regular splattershot jr with its bombs and bubbler
splatoon,3dy526,Dmav210,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"It's a ""hunters"" weapon.  You have to be smart to use it, you can't just rush in.   And while I agree it's a better support weapon, I can rack up serious kills with map awareness, disruptors and a little patience."
splatoon,3dy526,kodi_68,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"It's definitely more of a support weapon, but it lays down a lot of ink, so you can often outscore your teammates.  I call it a ""Harry"" weapon because it allows you to slow down and find your enemies.   Often when people get hit with a disruptor they retreat, so it's a great time to ink over their ink.   If you've got the locator going, easy peasy, butter 'em up (spread ink on their flanks) and pick a position to splat them from.   Even if you don't have the locator going, the disruptor still shows their location.    If you can hit more than one person with the disruptor, you've turned the tide for a bit.     I get people from behind with this setup so much.     Also, learn to go over obstacles.   If you can get close, you've got 'em.     Maps can really make a difference there though.  It's always harder to fight uphill, but it seems worse with this setup."
splatoon,3dy526,kodi_68,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's so hard to handle on Moray Towers. I always sneak up, throw a Disruptor and defeat them. I still have enough Ink left to do so.  I just love the Disruptors, especially on Tower Control. Is there a Disruptor/Bubbler combo? That would be way too OP, though."
splatoon,3dy526,ruefle,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"I main the Custom Jr. and focus my loadout on Damage Up, Ink Saver (Sub), and Ink Recovery Up.  One main Damage Up and four subs increases the power of three shots from 84 damage up to 99/100. (Five subs instead of four makes it peak at 99.9.) While technically not a three-hit kill, it's pretty rare for someone to be running around (especially in Ranked) with perfect health, which is what they'd need to have to survive that attack. (Not to mention that the Jr.'s ink spread, while annoying for accuracy, helps to ensure they're left standing on enemy ink, which can deal the final killing damage.) Also helps keep you competitive with Defense Up users.  Ink Saver (Sub) helps you throw more Disruptors, while Ink Recovery Up helps you get them back faster, of course. Bomb Range Up is also great for targeting from afar, since it does affect Disruptors and Point Sensors (unlike Sprinklers).  Honestly, I don't focus any of my gear on building up my special—no Special Saver, Duration Up, Charge Up, or Tenacity. I think the focus there should just be on staying alive and using the gun's ink spread to build up special. If all you want to do is pop off 4+ Echos per match, you should probably be using the .96 Gal haha. The Custom Jr., to me, is really about disrupting as much as possible to assist your teammates in getting kills, while also engaging in hunting/ambushing of your own."

splatoon,3dus8q,JQBarbados,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:36 2015 UTC,Why is popularity a factor? I just don't get it. Who cares if people like to eat more than they sleep? I'm more impressed with sleep's higher win rate despite the smaller team. Sleep won in my book (as did cats btw).
splatoon,3dus8q,walk-in-silence,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"Why is popularity a factor? ... Who cares if people like to eat more than they sleep?  I'm more impressed with sleep's higher win rate despite the smaller team.  ...   Alright, here is how Splatfest works.  The goal of the game is to pick what you think is better.   To specifically quote Callie: ""Which do you like better-X or Y?""  This is not fully about which team will have the best players, but what you as the player enjoy more, whether it be a subject, an object, or an activity.    Now then, lets make a special scenario.  This scenario will not count the popularity of a team; only the wins will be counted  The results for this Splatfest were 63% to 37% in the popularity section.  So, let us say that there are 63 players in Team Eating and 37 players in Team Sleeping.  This make 15 complete teams in Team Eating and a 16th team with 3 members, while Team Sleeping will have 9 teams with a 10th team of a single player.  Now then, let us pair the teams up so that each match has two teams:    Team A Team B Winner    Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating Sleeping Either   Eating (3/4) Sleeping (1/4) Either   Eating Eating Eating   Eating Eating Eating   Eating Eating Eating    Now then, as you can see, Team Sleeping does not have enough teams to fill the matches.  This leads to several matches between members of the same team.  Of course, that just means that Team Sleeping would need to work harder if matches between the same team counted toward the total.  In the scenario that those matches would count, it would hurt the members of the least popular team as they would need to win enough matches to overcome the guaranteed wins for the more popular team.    So, what if we discounted those matches?  That would make everything fair, right?  After all, the only thing that is being counted is just the matches between the teams.  In this scenario, it instead makes it unfair for Team Eating for being more popular.  Given that a more popular team is going to have a larger spread of players with different skillsets and strategies over a team that is less popular; a more popular team is going to have a larger number of players who might not play as well as the average player.  Why does this matter?  Because that means that a more popular team is going to have a higher chance of having average or below players going into any specific match.  If the best players on Team Eating are going into matches with themselves, then it does not matter what happens in that game as it will not count towards the overall win percentage.  What matters is who wins between both teams.  The solution to this is to have two different categories; in the case of a Splatfest, this is 'Popularity' and 'Winning'.  'Popularity' fulfills what was said earlier as to which subject, object, or activity while also being a slight counter to just counting the matches between the matches.  'Winning' fulfills a way for the less popular team to have a path to still win due to counting more to the final score, while giving the more popular team a condition to still have to fight for.  TL;DR - You know the idea behind the US Congress?  It might not be great, but the idea is roughly the same.  On one side, everyone matter the same which gives more power to the smaller states as their opinions are equal to the larger states.  (Read: Winning)  On the other, everyone has power directly in proportion to their size, giving more power to the larger states.  (Read: Popularity)  Combine both together and you get the US Congress, a compromise to not allowing either side to have a more control that the other.  (Read: Splatfest)    (Extra: Video 1: 2:03 - ""Marie: So, Callie, which do you like better-cats or dogs?""; Video 2: 1:15 - Callie: We have to know: which is your idea of heaven? -- 1:32 - Callie: So which are you? Total foodie or sleeping beauty? -- 1:54 - Callie: So what about YOU folks? Be sure to cast your vote! -- 1:57 - Marie: After you've voted, you'll get a Splatfest Tee!; Video 3: 0:56 - Callie: Do you prefer to coast through life? -- 0:59 - Marie: Or are you the type to let it slide? -- 1:13 - Marie: So, Callie, how do you get your kicks? -- 1:32 - Callie: What about you? Are you a roller or a slider?)"
splatoon,3dus8q,much_treats,2,Mon Jul 20 03:56:43 2015 UTC,"The teams are randomly chosen and large enough thus statistically speaking both will tend toward a bell curve. When that happens, statistically, both teams have an equal chance of good players joining any given match. Yes in your scenario Eating has more players, meaning they will have more bad players. But they will also have more good players too to balance it out. When Randomly making up a team, the chance of picking a good player balances out across both teams. In the Eating vs Eating matches, the chances that good players are ""wasting their time"" in that match is equal to bad players.    The real solution is to assign teams. Each splatfest, half the people get team A, the other half get team B, randomly distributed. Yes, you lose out on picking your team, but how much does that really matter? Do people really feel that strongly about cats vs dogs or rice versus bread? Then both teams have about equal number of players, equally distributed. Remove popularity as any kind of factor (as it's completely irrelevant), and let the best team win."
splatoon,3dus8q,FrooglyMoogle,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"The possibility of having a match with players of your own team was not originally part of Splatfest.  It was patched in after the first Japanese splatfest just so that the people on the most popular team wouldn't have to wait forever for a match.  If they hadn't patched it in, there wouldn't be any ""friendly"" matches at all, just really long lobby wait times.  So it really makes sense for these matches to not be counted - they're just to kill time while waiting for a real match.   And as has been repeated several times by several people on different threads, statistically speaking, as long as the players are matched randomly enough, the more popular team's higher amount of poor players is irrelevant, as they also have a higher number of good players and more players overall - it is just as likely that a good player will be sent in for a ""real"" match as a bad player.  Unless there is some sort of reason why Team Eating (for example) would inherently have a higher relative proportion of bad players (I don't see why that would be the case), the proportions of good-to-bad-to-mediocre players should be pretty close between both teams (which they were, with 52% wins vs. 48% wins), and the proportions are all that matter since matchmaking is random."

I think they were just too eager for the knockout though, because they just kept super jumping back onto the tower and we took 'em out, then started riding it when it went into overtime. One teammate was on the front, shooting, while I hid in ink behind the pole. I guess they just rushed too quickly to get us off the tower, because I didn't even have to do anything, my teammates easily took 'em out, and we won :D"
splatoon,3dz7r4,yaminokaabii,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"In Tower Control it's entirely situational the whole match. Just because a team say jumped to an early lead pushing the tower to ""2"" if they haven't had the tower on the ""offense"" side of center since then it is doubtful they will get the win.    It is still surprising the number of times the tower is free and no one wants to take control."

That's just what we do, because blah blah region lock blah blah and Nintendo doesn't put a lot of attention on the non-Japanese Asian regions (plainly put it sucks).  I have a certain delay and it is noticeable, especially in Splatfest, to a certain extent, that a lot of times I end up trading kills when on my end it looked like I came out on top, and I'm sure my opponent thought the same; but the point is I'm pretty sure in the long run that's no big deal.  Then there are people that can stand in our team's ink, not die while my team's 3 rollers go all in on him, and by all in I do mean ALL IN, all 3 rollers swinging at him for a solid 5 or so seconds! Then finally die HALFWAY ACROSS THE MAP.  I'm pretty sure that it was not me who was lagging there despite me being half a globe away from most of you. I'm pretty sure that guy lagged to all the other 7 people including myself.  Anyway the moral of this story is: IF you lag as much as the guy I just described you probably need to, er, upgrade from the 56k dial up. I mean, it's 2015."

splatoon,3e3a7e,GoldWinchester,-20,Tue Jul 21 17:02:42 2015 UTC,Losing isn't fun. Bringing down your team isn't fun. I don't understand how someone can be bad at something and actually enjoy it without guilt.
splatoon,3e3a7e,Shagarelli,12,Tue Jul 21 17:06:14 2015 UTC,You should be playing a different game them. Or maybe learn how to have fun.
splatoon,3e3a7e,lodum,5,Tue Jul 21 17:09:30 2015 UTC,"Because they attach fun to the second-to-second gameplay instead of just attributing fun to the act of winning / progressing towards a goal (of which, after 20 is only really getting to A+).  I'm not good at that, so I usually end up disliking all my games and not wanting to play them. Splatoon included. Got to A- and played the ""Drop to B+, Rise to A-"" game a few times and now I just don't play Splatoon anymore."
splatoon,3e3a7e,Whelt,3,Tue Jul 21 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"You need to not attach progression to an in-game number or letter. You can still have goals that the game doesn't quantify.  Smash Bros. for instance, it doesn't really give you a score or keep track of anything but number of wins and losses in multiplayer battles. But there's still endless room for improvement. Splatoon is the same way."
splatoon,3e3a7e,ikagun,-13,Tue Jul 21 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"Losing still isn't fun, then. How can you have fun if spend most of your time respawning due to your own incompetence? You might as well just sit in spawn and not do anything because you're not contributing anyway."

splatoon,3e3a7e,ikagun,-9,Tue Jul 21 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"Not really. I don't play games I'm bad at because being bad at something isn't fun for me. I'd rather NOT spend my time on a losing streak. I play until I get bored or until I stop improving, and then I move on to something else. In team games, when you're reliant on your team to NOT suck, your personal progress means absolutely nothing so I'd rather just play with people who are more on my skill level to improve with them than worrying about carrying absolutely terrible players who don't know what they're doing.   So yeah. I don't do things I'm bad at because it's just frustrating. I don't understand how people can have fun and be absolutely horrible. Usually when you're bad at something and don't see improvement you stop doing it."
splatoon,3e3a7e,lodum,6,Tue Jul 21 17:17:32 2015 UTC,yeah really. just because you can't have fun when losing doesn't mean you should be a shit and tell people who are fine with it to not do anying

For people that just bought the game and don't know how to use one charger, those guys aren't level 20. If you got to 20 without using the charger, they still know basic game mechanics even if they need to grasp the weapon (which can be done in about 5 matches or so.)   i'm talking about people who go maybe 200p the whole match and have 10 deaths at level 20. These are the people who shouldn't be playing, not someone who is low level and still learning."

splatoon,3e3a7e,bralko,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:31:24 2015 UTC,"You can get used to real players with any weapon. That strategy doesn't change. You just make minor adjustments to your effective range and aiming when in an actual match after learning what your new weapon's effective range is. Roller, splatgun and charger strategies are all the same and do not change from weapon to weapon. You just adjust for a new weapon's characteristics within that type. Same thing with sub weapons. You learn how to use them on one weapon and you pretty much know how effective they are across the board."

Your own argument hinges on the idea that you should have fun regardless of the fun of others in a team based game. Due to the nature of teams, everyone needs to carry their weight.

splatoon,3dzq68,pbzeppelin1977,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate.  Splatoon is actually the first shooter I've played (unless GTA San Andreas counts), so I was never ""cursed"" with being used to other controls. To each his own though.  Personally I avoid using the Y button. I've tried it for a while, since someone said it;s a great way to do a near-180 turn, but I've found it mostly just fucks up the calibration of the gyro controls. Now I primarily use the gyro controls (you can do a 180 with gyro controls fine), and I only use the stick to readjust the camera when I turn a corner (otherwise you have to sit sideways on your chair), or to look around when I'm hiding in my ink.  I never turned the gyro controls off, and I started my ""adventure"" by completing the single-player mode. That's how I got used to the controls. I guess you just need to practice to get good with the controls, just like how you have to practice in every game. Experience is key.  Note: the weapons I use don't require point-perfect aim. I've heard many charger mains say they prefer to play without gyro controls. So it might be better to leave the gyro controls off depending on your weapon of choice."
splatoon,3dzq68,SomeMetroid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"I saw a few people say they use gyro as charger on the lowest setting so that they can use it for the real fine tuning.

splatoon,3dzq68,SomeMetroid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:29 2015 UTC,Hmm. Okay. Maybe my sensitivity could be part of the problem too. What sensitivity do you use for not chargers?
splatoon,3dzpbk,imanonthemoon,5,Mon Jul 20 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"You can turn off the gyro controls if you want; though I advise against it. It seems that most of the good players use a combination of gyro controls and the stick (though chargers tend to prefer just the stick). Have you gone through the single player mode yet? You should be more than ready once you've finished that mode.  Finally, know that you can increase/decrease the sensitivity of the gyro controls."
splatoon,3dzpbk,Huawij,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Take notice how you normally hold the gamepad when you play (for me, it is on my lap).  Once you center the gyro with the Y button, aiming up and down is as simple as a slight wrist movement up or down (up and down is pretty sensitive so you don't need that much range of movement).  Although you could aim left and right with gyro, you shouldn't try it unless you need to be that precise (like a splatterscope shot).  Left and right should be handled with the right stick, and that's where you would want to fine tune the sensitivity (it is kinda stiff by default, so go ahead and increase sensitivity).  Afterwards, try playing Single Player (or even Recon mode) to play around with your aiming and movement and adjust accordingly."
splatoon,3dzpbk,MastaPCP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:26 2015 UTC,"its just really throws me off aiming left and right with the sticks and up and down with the gyro, really wish i could just use my gamecube controller haha!"
splatoon,3dzpbk,OatmealDome,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"You can turn off the gyro controls-- See the options menu on the GamePad. Again, it is highly recommended to keep them on. You can also turn the GamePad left and right if you wish for more fine tuned aiming than the stick alone could do."

splatoon,3dzpbk,thefreightrain,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"If you just bought Splatoon, go through the single player with the gryo controls, that's the best place to learn them, and they'll either click there or they won't. Think of it like an extended, more challenging tutorial.  The bosses will also unlock a few more guns, final boss some more gear, and the final boss is a strong challenge while being extremely fun.  For additional challenge in single player, don't upgrade your gear. It's helpful, but not necessary."
splatoon,3dzpbk,squaswin,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"the final boss is a strong challenge while being extremely fun and having awesome music   FTFY.  I absolutely agree. The single player helped me with using the gyro controls too. When I started, I had to carefully think about what I needed to do to make the game do something, but now its just second nature. It is only 4 hours long and you cant buy the Aerosprays or Dynamos without it.  In the firing range (Press Y in the equip menu or in Ammo Knights), you can dynamically adjust the sensitivity to what you prefer."
splatoon,3dzpbk,gijensen92,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"I set sensitivity to max, I use gyro for aiming (like inking or splatting) and I use the joystick for turning while traveling. It only took a few matches to get the hang of it for me, single player definitely helps.  Without max sensitivity I couldn't get the hang of gyro controls."
splatoon,3dzpbk,OatmealDome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:17:08 2015 UTC,"Here's my boilerplate text I give to people who ask about the gyro controls:   If you need to finetune the sensitivity of the gyro, you can enter the weapons test room (press Y in equip menu or weapons shop) and open the controls menu on the GamePad and test your weapons. Once you have your perfect sensitivity, get some practice in the Single Player levels (you will unlock some weapons when you beat each boss as well)"

splatoon,3dzpbk,Exaskryz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:53 2015 UTC,Play through the campaign mode while using the gyro controls. That's what I did to get used to them.
splatoon,3dzpbk,bustedradio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:09:12 2015 UTC,"for the most part, you will will be moving the camera with the right stick. gyro controls are really great for doing snap aims. if you slightly over reach with the right stick, use the gyro controls to quickly fix it.  gryo controls are especially good for snipers because it's more precise and faster aiming.   i would advise that you play the single player campaign to get use to the controls.   it's fine if you don't want to use the gyro controls. just make sure to adjust the sensitivity to the range you like best. i often play with and without gyro controls depending on my weapon."

splatoon,3dxadu,Iinneus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, that makes sense... It's a strategy that got somewhat popular when the game came out, and then people stopped doing it, and so now you're seeing it a little more again out of nowhere.  Hiding in ink and repositioning can be more effective than jumping, but if you have good aim, just back up and shoot them out of the air!"
splatoon,3dxadu,Corne777,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:09 2015 UTC,Just make sure you stop jumping when your facing a good charger player.

splatoon,3dxadu,ikagun,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"a lot of people do it worldwide, the reason for this is one i believe Judd tells us of - your ink splashes will go wider if you jump. it's very very essential with certain weapons like brushes and blasters. if you are using a weapon with an aiming reticule, you will notice that the little white border will expand as you jump.  to combat it... just keep shooting, honestly. i jump all the time and i still get splatted like nobody's business."

splatoon,3dxadu,Whelt,3,Mon Jul 20 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"Try a weapon with bombs, if someone keeps jumping they probably keep spamming the jump which makes it harder for them to avoid bombs at their feet since they have to land before they can start squidswimming.   Remember the regular bombs ticks down while they touch the ground, so if you slide it on the ground towards them it'll explode shortly after it arrives at their spot depending on how far away."
splatoon,3dxadu,Huawij,2,Mon Jul 20 08:35:54 2015 UTC,"Same here tbh. I just, I really like it even though it's so weak damage/range-wise. I tried pretty much everything else, but I just can't sacrifice the shot speed. Since that's how it is, I try to avoid all the splats I can, aside from some random weenie getting caught in my inkstrike"
splatoon,3dxadu,frozenpandaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm an MG user, and you can totally go aggro with an Aerospray. My style is to get in close and kill quickly. You can't do much if they see you from a distance, so that's when I toss a Seeker and squid away. Sometimes that's enough! Or other times I stay out of their range but keep firing at the spot to cover up their work, prevent them from taking the splat zone or whatever.  If you're an RG you don't have the Seeker option, but you can still get the drop on people. There are few other shooters that will beat an Aerospray at close range."
splatoon,3dxadu,suupernovae,2,Mon Jul 20 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"MG main here. If you jump while shooting, you will be able to cover more turf, and your reach will also slightly increase. However, your spread will also become worse (meaning jumping while in a firefight can actually do you more harm than good), so take that in mind. Jumping is useless against blasters, rollers and chargers, so stay on the ground when you're fighting those. Against splattershots and aerosprays you'll have to judge for yourself based on the situation whether jumping is worth it.  As for how to fight it: anticipate it, and be ready to adjust your aim constantly. You could also try to jump in synch with your opponent."

Get good at releasing ZL and pressing X while shooting simultaneously (you'll jump higher than usual). Get it into a rhythm spamming this combo while aiming at your opponent. Then when you're good at it, only use it sparingly. So when you see an enemy, sometimes you'll pop up and just shoot. Other times you'll pop up jump and shoot. It keeps you unpredictable and gives extra distance to your shot the higher you are (when you need it). Plus if you time the jump with their jump, it's like a regular grounded shot and you'll likely Splat them first!"

splatoon,3dy6o8,pbzeppelin1977,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"Given the way brushes play the kraken is even worse than it already is.  I think a bubbler would be unbalanced but echolocator would be perfect.  The inkzooka would be a good couple too as an opposite of the E-Litre 3K which has a long range main but short range sub.  Brushes play by being stealth, being a giant kraken that can't hide, goes st normal speed but can also be knocked back just ruins the brushes play style.

For inkstrike, you just have to get to a safe location for 3 seconds.  I think kraken works well with how rollers/brushes play. You can advance with no fear, knowing you can kraken at any time and run away to another place on the map to cover in ink. Or you can use it to kill whoever jumped on you, but using it for retreat is genius because it lets you become an inkbrush for 6 seconds for no paint, letting you relocate no a new place or advance with no risk. Or, heck, to place a beacon."

splatoon,3dy6o8,Gaius404,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"What I mean is ink strike is useful no matter where i am or when I get it. I focus on charging that bar a lot since I focus on coverage, so being able to use the ink strike safely anywhere on the map and make a difference is great. With bomb rush, I usually save it for a while until I find a good opportunity to use it because it just slows me down and does what a gun/roller could've done coverage-wise."
splatoon,3dy6o8,Whelt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"But it's not always useful, many times I've needed to fall back to launch it otherwise risk dying before I can actually fire it or dying while it's firing.  And while it covers a fair amount of ground you often send it miles away to be cleaned up in seconds.  Bomb rushes on the other hand actively push and hold back enemies much better than one guy with one gun.  Bombs are also semi random where as an ink strike is marked and has finite time so you can just go with it's ebb and floe like nothing's happened."

In tower control, if another of your teammates is already on the tower, don't jump up there. Instead, shoot the enemy on the ground. They'll be focusing on the tower and you can wipe them out. Heck, sometimes I'll leave the tower with nobody on it just to circle around and surprise an enemy. Learning when to be on the tower and when to be off the tower was really important for me."

splatoon,3dw5lj,LillePingle,14,Mon Jul 20 01:11:09 2015 UTC,My current favorite use for them is throwing them at walls to climb up instead of trying to flick the roller at it.  I dislike using them for combat because it's really hard to tell how much damage you've dealt with one.
splatoon,3dw5lj,ParanoidDrone,5,Mon Jul 20 02:07:41 2015 UTC,They are awesome for combat since they can't be easily dodged and they are your only long range attack. It takes two of them for the splat or one roller fling from afar and one burst bomb.
splatoon,3dw5lj,Piaya,3,Mon Jul 20 03:19:38 2015 UTC,I found out to use them like this at Bluefin Depot when I couldn't climb walls with the flick. Now it's a simple 2 button presses to get up a wall. Super useful too to get the jump on someone rounding a corner and 1-hit slam them.
splatoon,3dw5lj,NitroxDragon,4,Mon Jul 20 04:00:11 2015 UTC,Agreed! Strength up makes them even deadlier

splatoon,3dw5lj,Whelt,2,Mon Jul 20 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, what do you mean? Its flick is a 1HKO.  I feel like I'm misinterpreting you."
splatoon,3dw5lj,gijensen92,6,Mon Jul 20 01:48:16 2015 UTC,Yes but other rollers can ohko you from further away due to their flick having a longer range
splatoon,3dw5lj,meloneee,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:26 2015 UTC,"If you hit them with the roller itself it's a 1HKO, which is fine because it's so fast. The splash from a distance though isn't very strong."
splatoon,3dw5lj,Whelt,5,Mon Jul 20 02:03:18 2015 UTC,The roller itself is less damage than the paint coming off of it. I've played an awful lot of carbon roller :).  It's short range but extremely effective and definitely a 1HKO. I think the roller itself is a 2HKO.
splatoon,3dw5lj,gijensen92,3,Mon Jul 20 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the roller flick. The flick is only an 1HKO at close range. We're saying the same thing, you keep misinterpreting."
splatoon,3dw5lj,Whelt,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:09:17 2015 UTC,"This is a mess of interpretations, I believe. Comical even.  You specified when you hit them with the roller with a flick. I could be wrong but I believe if the roller itself hits during a flick, the paint will launch past the person or be null, and they'll take the same damage as if you rolled into them. Situations where I'm too close seemed to kill me often, it /could/ be lag but it didn't seem like it."
splatoon,3dw5lj,gijensen92,4,Mon Jul 20 02:14:23 2015 UTC,I've been using it for a few weeks and it always seems to kill at point blank.
splatoon,3dw5lj,Whelt,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll go back and mess around with it. It's been a couple weeks. I know it definitely kills bit before point blank as well, I had a nice sweet spot :).  Edit: Hitting on swing with roller is a 1HKO, and you can be a whole line away and still 1HKO if you can aim :3."
splatoon,3dw5lj,gijensen92,4,Mon Jul 20 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"He means that upon flicking you both swing the roller, and fling ink. If you just try to hit with the ink you fling off of it, it's not very powerful... but if you bring the roller itself down on the enemy it's a 1HKO.  EDIT* Also it the roller is the 1HKO, when flicked... if you roll into enemies it doesn't do jack, but flicking it into their face is ALWAYS a 1HKO... the paint flung is super weak sauce though. I can even vouch for their facts, I've played a little with it, and YES it is a 1HKO upon direct contact."
splatoon,3dw5lj,robotoboy20,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:10 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks! I will add that the paint is definitely also a 1HKO at the right range as well. Squidboards can confirm this with one of their ""hard data"" threads :)."
splatoon,3dw5lj,gijensen92,7,Mon Jul 20 02:34:32 2015 UTC,Biggest trick with carbon roller (stolen from an older thread) is to mash the grenades as you are flicking.  If you do so you'll burst bombs between your flicks easily doubling your damage output.

splatoon,3dw5lj,tyroney,3,Mon Jul 20 05:40:20 2015 UTC,Sure you run out of ink quickly but this lets you kill people from the edge of your range much faster and can be a lot of use when you can't quite close the gap.
splatoon,3dw5lj,Acterian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:51:45 2015 UTC,"In my limited experience, the aim of each is way too different unless you're point blank. A solid fling hit will send splat bombs over the target's head otherwise."

It's slower than hell, and takes forever to sling ink, so if you aren't accurate on your 1st shot, or the enemy is wise enough to get away, then you've wasted your ink and time.   I think the 1st roller available is probably the best overall roller. Very balanced. The Carbon is pretty great though."
splatoon,3dw5lj,Whelt,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience dynamo roller does very well against other rollers. They have so much more range, that getting close enough to flick them back is very hard. But I run into the dynamo so rarely, I've not had much chance to practice against it."

I once took my moment of reprieve when I had just secured the right side of Bluefin Depot and someone started tapping on me, so I retreated back and hid his jump in point behind the cross section so any opponents coming down wouldn't see it.   A few moments after, once he's started his jump, I get into a firefight, there was possibly the tail end of a Kraken involved, and I'm nearly splatted and retreating around the back end as whoever it was was after me.   In comes my teammate, a roller, who managed to not just be attentive of where he's landing, but swung right on the guy as he came down and splatted him right then and there. My relief was palpable, and lived to splat another day.  Goes to show you that when you're good to your support, your support's good to you."
splatoon,3dvp8a,thefreightrain,7,Sun Jul 19 22:47:32 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY! And like you said, hiding their jump point is useful too. And if you can't, at least keep an eye on it. Not only is it important to just defend it, but sometimes enemies get distracted by the jump point, especially chargers, so you can get a free kill on them. But... like I said, focus on playing as a team, not so much the killing part. :P"
splatoon,3dvp8a,thefreightrain,6,Sun Jul 19 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, playing as a Jet Squelcher with the Splash Wall taught that lesson well, and it really paid off when I found a consistent team that first Splatfest. That thing is so useful; if I don't feel like staying near their jump ring, I'll drop a splash wall down just in front then head off.  After Splatfest, though, it got so hard to be effective when teammates weren't using them (though that may have been me learning how to be aggro myself rather than support and sniper-splatter)."
splatoon,3dvp8a,thefreightrain,4,Sun Jul 19 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, these matches were after Splatfest. During Splatfest I had a lot of great matches. Nothing like ""We all worked together super well!"" but I had some awesome teammates, never anyone who was abysmal."
splatoon,3dvp8a,TonesBalones,3,Sun Jul 19 23:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think it had more to do with the maps looking back. I know exactly how to use the Splash Wall on Urchin Underpass, Port Makeral, and Walleye Warehouse, and moderately well on the Mall and Kelp dome (love Kelp Dome with Squelchers). I think Bluefin Depot was on rotation, and I think that map is what eventually made me look at other options. I also just play a lot more aggressively now, despite my attempts to get back into that more support role."
splatoon,3dvp8a,oonniioonn,4,Sun Jul 19 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"Hiding in the jump circle is exactly what you don't want to do. If an enemy is nearby the point they will prefire it, meaning you will die pretty much instantly and can't escape because they laid down fresh ink on you. It would be better to stay off to the side watching it to see if an enemy starts to prefire the jump, and then take them out while they are distracted.  But a better idea than that is to not super jump to the zone in the first place. Unless your team is in absolute control and half their team is dead, just walk there. Please. You severely hurt your team by being a liability, and you come in with a severe information disadvantage if something goes wrong."
splatoon,3dvp8a,skabadelic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to hide in the jump circle. :P I've seen people do that and gotten accidental free kills off of them because of it. But yes, defending the circle in general to make sure they don't die is more what I meant.  Depending on the map it could be useful, but I get what you're saying. On maps like Moray Towers it can be useful to super jump to certain areas, but you've definitely got a point. When you said Zone, did you mean like in Splat Zones? Cause I would never do that at all. :P That's just ""KILL ME"" in bright neon lights."

splatoon,3dvp8a,milehightechie,2,Mon Jul 20 11:23:03 2015 UTC,"On Bluefin I don't see much point on jumping anyways only because most of the action takes place in the middle, and it's such a small map. I've had some good jumps on Moray, but that was also the map I had that awful encounter with a Kraken and bubbler who left me. So I guess that one can be hit or miss. But you're right, a lot of people just tend to jump to whoever is farthest without even seeing what's going on, too often I see teammates letting someone in our spawn and jumping past them."
splatoon,3dvp8a,milehightechie,5,Mon Jul 20 12:45:18 2015 UTC,"If someone begins tapping you to alert you to them Squid Jumping to you, back off from the enemy.   Superjumping is a bad idea to begin with, and you've just highlighted one of the many reasons why. Perhaps you (and everyone else) should stop doing it.  When I'm pushing in on the point or the tower, I'm usually on a flank or at least making some sort of positional play. That means that I have to get in, get some picks, and get out as soon as possible. I don't have time to back off and let you superjump safely, because if I do, my opportunity disappears and I probably die.  If you superjump to mid while I'm pushing, there's a damn good chance I'm going to either trade with someone eventually or I'm going to die outright. At the very least, I'm going to be at a positional disadvantage, meaning I can't just back off because you felt the need to emphasise speed over positioning. All kits with wall rely on wall to be good, meaning they should have a 100% uptime on it, meaning they can't just throw a wall down to save you. All kits with bubbler want to be using bubbler to prevent exchanges at close range or escape from bad situations, and covering your superjump with bubbler just means that the bubbler gets pinballed. All kits with short range want to be pushing forward, not losing ground, and all kits with long range will be slowpushing with their range advantage, and backing off removes the pressure they exert.  Superjumping also gives you an information disadvantage of about five seconds (which is enough time for someone to walk into position with a zooka, pop your entire team, and get in to finish you off even on a secure mid), has loud audio cues even with stealth jump (that ruin flanks and positional plays), and makes teammates who are trying to hide very obvious. It also groups you with someone else, which is something you absolutely want to avoid given the way teammates block each others' bullets and can easily be sprayed down by a single person or taken out with a single grenade (or, of course, taken out with a single dynamo flick). It only gives you a small speed advantage at the cost of no special (out of spawn, at least; you can always build it and jump, but you can also build it on the way to mid and come in from a better position), and unknown positioning (since you don't know what your teammate is going to do or if where they seem to be on the map is even where they are). Pincer engagements (two people coming from two different angles) are the best way to secure kills, and they utterly destroy people who superjump (because even if someone does have time to back off safely, they will just get mopped up by the guy coming from behind) while also being impossible out of a superjump (since you need to move quite a long way to get into position).   Superjumps are for escapes and last-ditch efforts. They are not for you to save a couple seconds (which are not precious unless they will directly determine win-loss) by fucking up someone's flank.  As for these anecdotes about people being successful with superjumps: Try it in A+. See what happens. They sometimes work; they usually don't, and they can lose you games.   I reactively began shooting them to keep them at bay   Krakens are starting to catch onto the fact that their stick has a horizontal axis. Do what you should have been doing to begin with and kite it. Shooting at them isn't going to work for much longer outside of B rank.  As for bubblers, the netcode for them is awkward; if you activate a bubbler near someone, they have to be near you on their screen to receive the benefit. If you want a bubbler, you have to meet them halfway."
splatoon,3dvp8a,gijensen92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:54 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I was playing Turf Wars for most of this, not Ranked matches. Ranked is a different story, I would never super jump in ranked, as you're correct in saying that flanking and positioning are much more important, and I would never even begin to disagree with you. However, I still think there's some merit to not letting your teammates die. I mean... you're assuming in every situation, your teammates are going to die. But assume on Port Mackarel you go behind one of the crates so they jump to it, and then you move to the left side. Now your teammate can go right while you go left, helping you out in the process. Of course, that's only one instance of it being useful, but even so it's still a better option than just going in on your own because you think you can outperform the team yourself.  I usually try to jump to people I think need help (again, in Turf Wars) and I think I can get to without much disaster, such as people near cover. But then they proceed to continue OUT of cover, which of course will get me killed.  I know Turf Wars is a different beast from Ranked so, I suppose there's not much to be said about that. But in terms of Turf Wars, I think it's a viable tactic to use if your teammates can help along the way, for instance tricking people to thinking there's only one Dual Squelcher behind the wall, when all of a sudden a Krak-On Roller comes out of nowhere.   ""Perhaps I should stop doing."" Perhaps I should. Perhaps it could also become a more viable tactic in the future. But I do appreciate the different viewpoint on the matter, I definitely think there are times when it's not the most viable tactic."

splatoon,3dyryw,Eoseri,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"Things to know:  gameplay:  -- the objective of turf war is to cover the god damned floor. Expect many people online to not understand this, and cover the bare minimum as they go for kills instead.  -- the objective of ranked tower control is to whine about how retarded your team is as everyone but you ignores the fact that someone has to RIDE the cube to victory. Rest of team will focus on marking turf as far away as possible from the cube, only caring about kills, or dying within 5 seconds of respawning  -- In ranked splat zones you must hold and defend one or two areas the longest, pay attention to your game pad's map as all 3 of your allies run to one area and you're left all alone defending the other spot  -- be prepared to get annoyed at how the level rotation works - it cycles every 4 hours or so, selecting 2 maps for ranked and 2 maps for turf wars.  weapons / gear:  -- You level up as you play online, as you level up more fresh clothing and weapon sets become available to purchase. The clothing takes longer to cycle through (it updates once per day).  -- The weapons are decently balanced, levels don't matter so much beyond more weapon combos. There are a ton of level 20s (max level) using level 1-10 gear  -- You can unlock additional weapon sets for purchase through the story mode, and it's actually a pretty neat puzzle shooter for single player with a kick ass final boss.  -- abilities on gear are cool but some are better than others - there's a youtube channel that shows the strength of different abilities.  -- Every piece of clothing can hold up to 3 sub-ability slots. sub-abilities are weaker than the main ability but can sort of add up. At level 20, Spyke in the back alley will let you add slots to 1 / 2 star gear or reroll ALL sub abilities    I'm sure I forgot something :D"

splatoon,3dyryw,DergonSteps,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"You could check the Splatoon wiki, I guess. But I'd recommend just playing the game, and google/ask any questions you might have later."

splatoon,3dyryw,Whelt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"Leave motion on, and go through the single player campaign.  Motion has a higher level of accuracy and great range of speeds for turns, and single player unlocks lots of weapons that are useful for the high-level players, arguably better than most other weapons (krak on roller and tentatek shooter).  Also, the brand of your clothes decides how likely sub-abilities are to attach to a piece of equipment you level up. You can read about the abilities in the equipment screens.  Also, talk to Judd. He gives you money for your win streaks, and random advice that you can come back here and post for Karma."
splatoon,3dyryw,kidasquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"Play the single player. It is one of the easiest way to get used to the control scheme weather you use motion or dual stick. Motion controls provide extremely quick and accurate turns. If you look left with the pad and use the stick at the same time, you can do quick 180s. *The Y button is your friend. With motion, Y makes the screen face forward, allowing you to adjust the home position of the pad. With stick, it allows you to turn faster by holding Y and using the left stick. Turf > Kills. You can win just as many if not more games by retreating. If you are outnumbered, run and ink elsewhere. An active team mate is better than a dead one. The bubbler is good. When you are in trouble, use it. If you can't take the enemy, use it to retreat. Use recon mode and the test area. Press Y in the lobby to look at the maps without any enemies. Press Y in the weapons shop or equip menu to test out weapons. You can change the sensitivity dynamically in the weapon test area. Stay alive. Being in squid form heals you quicker. Choose your abilities to suit your style. Run out of ink too much? Use ink saver and ink refill. Find yourself dying too much? Use special saver, quick respawn and haunt. You can check the different abilities in the gear tab on the game pad. Super jumping it great. You can jump to team mates to get back into the action, jump to base if someone breaks through and makes a mess and you can jump to beakons. If someone else jumps to a beakon, you can still use it until they land. It is just a game. Nintendo didn't add voice chat so that no one spouts abuse at you if you are useless. Use turf wars to practice. No one cares about losing in turf wars, so use it to test new weapons and strategies.   Check YouTube. There are a lot of good tutorials, gameplay videos and analysis videos. Nintendojo does good analysis and ability videos and TheJWittz made a good 50 tips video.  Good luck. Good splatting and Staaay Fresh!"

splatoon,3dwpz5,YuriusFarrence,3,Mon Jul 20 04:56:44 2015 UTC,"It seems like Nintendo wanted people to learn about Splatoon slowly at first with the way that ranked was locked at first, and the maps/weapons they release later are the more technical ones to play on/use, with the game slowly becoming more and more competitive as updates drop. Now team matchmaking is coming soon as well.  EDITS: reworded the entire comment to make it sound better"
splatoon,3dwpz5,Effdee1,2,Mon Jul 20 05:08:04 2015 UTC,I don't think team matchmaking or custom games is on disk though like maps and weapons are. It's going to be an actual update that they hadn't finished yet for release.

splatoon,3dthws,ryechu,20,Sun Jul 19 09:31:17 2015 UTC,the hard caps are usually 3 mains +3-5 subs anyways. So this would be a waste.

splatoon,3dthws,DMthePerson,3,Sun Jul 19 10:48:50 2015 UTC,What do you mean? The game only applies that many of the same stat booster on your main weapon/sub weapon if you grind out a full set of one stat booster?
splatoon,3dthws,Emerly_Nickel,3,Sun Jul 19 16:42:08 2015 UTC,I think he/she means by main and sub the main and sub abilities on your clothes. The main ability would be the ability it comes with and the sub ability would be the ones you upgrade/reroll
splatoon,3dthws,DMthePerson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:41:56 2015 UTC,So what does he mean then? 3 main and 3-5 sub would be the amount of slots that clothing has.
splatoon,3dthws,Emerly_Nickel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:53 2015 UTC,I guess it's the amount of strength ups that will have any affect. Anymore would be a waste.
splatoon,3dthws,DMthePerson,2,Mon Jul 20 01:47:17 2015 UTC,"But that's what I'm saying. 3 main and 3-5 sub is the limit to stat boost slots on clothes as a whole. You couldn't go over that amount regardless, right?"
splatoon,3dthws,darkshaddow42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:47 2015 UTC,"3 main and 9 sub is the limit, technically. But the last 4-6 sub would be worth nothing due to diminishing returns."

However, strength up cannot lower a weapons shots to kill. An Inkbrush deals 20 damage at close range and strength up cannot raise it above 24.9 otherwise it will take less shots to kill."

splatoon,3dthws,MrOminous,6,Sun Jul 19 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"The rapid blaster takes two direct hits or three indirect hits to splat. It has a much longer range than the other blasters though, so it's more of a skirmishing weapon than a close quarters ambush weapon."

splatoon,3dthws,AliceTheGorgon,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"Range. Everyone always forgets range.  Weapons have damage falloff. This means they generally take more hits to splat from long range. Defence enlarges the range you can survive the base number of hits to splat, and damage enlarges the range you can splat someone else in the base number of hits.  If you never fight at anything other than point blank, then you don't need damage, but anything with range will definitely benefit from it."

All weapons cannot surpass their base ""hits to splat"" and 3 Attack Ups bring you to the cap on every weapon (unless I'm missing one, of course).

splatoon,3dv6vs,Inky_musty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:37:41 2015 UTC,"Oi, they stole it first. I'm simply taking it back."
splatoon,3dv6vs,Kittari,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:03:16 2015 UTC,True they stole the great zapfish. But you're taking every single zapfish they own as revenge. (If you listen after a boss fight you can hear metal structures falling apart and octarian screams in the distance)
splatoon,3dv6vs,Inky_musty,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:18 2015 UTC,"Eh... The fact that they STEAL the zapfish instead of asking for help makes it kind of hard to sympathize with them.  Besides, the implication of the credits images makes it seem like relations are improving between the two races, and it was Octavio's extremism and pride that were keeping them from reconciling."

splatoon,3dv6vs,Iinneus,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:45 2015 UTC,The Inklings REALLY aren't presented as the unequivocal heroes in the scrolls. It's a little frightening.  One of the scrolls portrays two Octarians as Adam and Eve in Eden and has a squid in place of the snake. You know... The snake that turned out to be SATAN.
splatoon,3dv6vs,Iinneus,2,Mon Jul 20 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the scrolls are by Inklings, and some (like this one, by Octolangelo) are by Octarians...it makes sense for the Octarians to be a little biased about the matter."
splatoon,3dv6vs,Kittari,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"That's what I really like. When you read through the scrolls, it's really hard to say exactly who's right. The scrolls written by neutral parties don't seem to lead towards either side."

splatoon,3dv6vs,TheGiik,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"It's obvious the Zapfish aren't to happy with how the Octarians treat them though. I don't know how Inklings extract power from them, but from how happy they look when they see you, it's gotta be better than how the Octarians do it.  Plus, when DJ Octavio uses the Great Zapfish to power his machine, he literally sucks it into a very small space. It can't be happy there. When it's powering the Inkopolis, it's just chilling cool as a cucumber on Inkopolis Tower, with plenty of room to move."

splatoon,3dwq74,SpyroFan-17,3,Mon Jul 20 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"Not so much. While the Splash Wall does block pathways for escape and the like, it isn't as punishing as being slowed down and having your location revealed by the disruptor."

You can't really camp with the squiffer, you have to be more mobile and be really accurate with your one shots.

Because your weapon charges so quickly, you can afford to be more in the line of fire. If you played a different charger, you have to wait for longer to charge it up, so you have to stay back before you die.  It is a matter of preference though. I prefer to be mid-range, and a Squiffer allows me to do that."

splatoon,3dtx5k,StaticScreen,7,Sun Jul 19 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"A little tip with sticky bombs;  use them under grates (floor you can swim through). This is especially in Kelp dome where people can walk over them without knowing.  Another good tactic is fire at an enemy while close a wall, shoot a sticky on the wall so he cant see it and when he's gonna come to pursue, he'll get trapped close to it.  last one is always shoot a nade where someone is hiding, like behind and obstacle. They will have to move and you will be able to easily gun them down.  Oh yeah also while swimming at full ink to get from point a to b, dont hold to a full ink tank, throw a nade, preferably over a wall into enemy territory."

splatoon,3dwwwn,pameatsbabies,2,Mon Jul 20 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'll try to give advice for the Octobrush specifically since you're not doing great with it. When you're spreading ink, you want to be swishing and jumping constantly (I highly recommend having ink saver mains). Roll with it when you need to escape or get somewhere fast. As for ambushing with it, try approaching from side hallways or from behind the opponent. You can always take a quick glance at your gamepad screen to see where your enemies are, their ink spreads will show you. Try to keep your special up, the Kraken is super useful for brush users who tend to get into tight spots."

splatoon,3dwwwn,Robyostuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"About getting sneaky, the carbon roller is the best one to do that, you just need to learn the specific situations where you can ambush opponents. Those situations can be learned by paying attention to how exactly you get splatted by other rollers.    For example, I used to die a lot, 1 vs 1 in bluefin depot in the zone where there are two short walls arranged like a cross because I let the enemmy take high ground first and splat me. When The carbon roller came out what I started doing is that when I aproach the crossed walls I throw a burst bomb at one of the walls so I can take high ground first and get splats from the ennemies who think they are safe behind the wall.    Other one I learned the hard way was the classic ambush that rollers make to each other. If most of the ground you are in is covered in your ink and you know something with short range will pass through like aerospray, carbon or normal rollers you can hide where they'll pass and when they get near you jump and splat them in the air before they have a chance to kill you (carbon roller can kill from a short distance with the splash if it's shot in the air).  What I want to say is that learning from your splats is the best way to learn ways to be sneaky. Some of your ennemies will be rage inducing sneaky bastards, and that's the kind of people you want to learn from."

Seriously, I played some slide teams that put up an amazing fight.   I would have loved to see peoples faces though when they thought Slides would win based on popularity. Now anyone trying to use that ""popularity contest"" argument will just sound ridiculous."
splatoon,3dt4kr,I_only_wish,6,Sun Jul 19 06:25:46 2015 UTC,Same here! Dogs and Coasters! I'm glad we won more games this time - the popularity contest argument made the dog victory feel less like a victory and more like a cheap win.
splatoon,3dt4kr,ssupermario92,24,Sun Jul 19 15:58:18 2015 UTC,that makes it Callie's 4th win in splatfests to Marie's 1.

splatoon,3dt4kr,TheDaveWSC,47,Sun Jul 19 06:07:54 2015 UTC,Hey the team that did better won for once! YEEAAHHH.
splatoon,3dt4kr,gomtuu123,15,Sun Jul 19 05:03:34 2015 UTC,That's been the case in 3 out of the 5 splatfests so far. Just sayin'.
splatoon,3dt4kr,much_treats,24,Sun Jul 19 05:18:50 2015 UTC,"You can't deny that popularity scoring presents a huge uphill battle for the other team, though.  Look at point deficits caused by popularity instead of whether the team won or lost to see a clearer picture:   Rice/Bread: 8 point deficit for Bread (need 55%+ wins to win) Fox/Tanuki: 17 point deficit for Tanuki (need 59%+ wins to win) Dogs/Cats: 12 point deficit for Cats (need 57%+ wins to win) Rock/Pop: 14 point deficit for Pop (need 58%+ wins to win) Coaster/Slide: 4 point deficit for Coaster (need 53%+ wins to win)   It worked out nicely this time due to a close popularity split, but whenever a theme comes around that has a strong popularity lean, the smaller team is going to have a really tough time."
splatoon,3dt4kr,Erisi,2,Sun Jul 19 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this is the only splatfest where the less popular team won by skill."

splatoon,3dt4kr,Radxical,10,Sun Jul 19 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"PSA, guys, make sure to log in to claim your super sea snails before the next splatfest is announced.  Nintendo can't manually award you your snails. You'll lose every snail that you would have earned because they won't be credited to you if the next splatfest theme is announced ingame.

splatoon,3dt4kr,Acterian,4,Sun Jul 19 05:16:10 2015 UTC,Am I the only person who feels somewhat insignificant?  Both teams I've joined have lost the wins portion and the fact that I personally had significantly more wins than losses doesn't even account for a fraction of a percent.
splatoon,3dt4kr,AdvancedBlackOps,4,Sun Jul 19 05:38:35 2015 UTC,"I'm 0 for 2 now. Nice. I'm partially to blame though, cuz I Noped outta there the moment I hit royalty rank.

splatoon,3dt4kr,mintkupocream,4,Sun Jul 19 06:39:26 2015 UTC,"My personal, unresearched theory on the numbers:  Younger kids are mostly too scared of roller coasters or not even allowed on them, and thus would be more inclined to choose the more accessible waterslides.  As this actually is a game targeted at kids, this group bulstered that category's numbers.    However, the younger players are less skilled than the daring teens that can stay up all night playing the game, this leading to a wider win margin for coasters.  Whatever the reason, congrats to team roller coasters!  Special shoutout to a player named pann who managed to get 10% of the board and 9 splats against my team during a 4 v 1.  You were a true warrior."
splatoon,3dt4kr,PokeWolfe64,20,Sun Jul 19 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"People still complaining about how Splatfest score is decided  Was on winning side twice, GO DOGGY COASTERS"
splatoon,3dt4kr,fivehournap,12,Sun Jul 19 05:07:54 2015 UTC,Lol there's people claiming there were more little kids on team water slides (really now?).   There will always be a plentiful supply of salt after splatfests.
splatoon,3dt4kr,pinkoctillery,8,Sun Jul 19 05:13:42 2015 UTC,That's funny. I felt the same way about team roller coasters because I'd watch my team get massacred by the other team.
splatoon,3dt4kr,AdvancedBlackOps,4,Sun Jul 19 05:25:21 2015 UTC,you could say the same thing for dogs. honestly how many kids do you know that like cats more than dogs..?

splatoon,3dt4kr,Practicalaviationcat,6,Sun Jul 19 05:56:33 2015 UTC,"Not overly surprised. Personal prediction was that even though the waterslides had more people, a lot of them were probably younger players that are therefore less likely to do well.   To be fair, I didn't have a remarkable performance either, so I'm probably just as much to blame."
splatoon,3dt4kr,ATLMLBFAN,9,Sun Jul 19 05:05:43 2015 UTC,I'm surprised water slides were more popular. I'm glad the less popular team won but I still think popularity should be removed from the Splatfests. GG everybody.
splatoon,3dt4kr,Lyratheflirt,12,Sun Jul 19 05:54:49 2015 UTC,"I am surprised it was that close! Honestly though, it makes sense water slides won in popularity being that this is a game with children playing, many are probably too afraid to ride roller coasters...."

Little less of a sting since I haven't started looking for the gear I want my inkling to be seen in yet.

If that were the case, and they had instead gone with Team Water Slide, it would have tilted the victory in Team Water Slide's favor, unless that 3% were also below average players who ended up bringing down Team Roller Coaster's win percentage.

I was even using a weapon with my most ink turfed on!) even tho we ended up winning due to popularity it felt like an absolute chore getting to queen.  this time, however i was literally given level 20s every single time. and even when disconnects happened and the squad would break apart I was still granted level 20s. everyone was good. i had maybe 1 or 2 bad teams TOTAL. and i only lost 9 games by the time i reached queen. it was so much fun!   but then i started to take notice of the sliders levels and what do you know? they were consistantly getting levels 6-11's on their teams vs our level 20s. i know levels dont matter much BUT theres a HUGE difference in time spent playing from 1-11 and 20.   overall i didnt feel too bad for them. because i was given 3v4's quite a lot and even a 1v4 once! (in which i went 11-3 with the octobrush)  i think the key is to pick the underdog.."

splatoon,3dt4kr,AdeonWriter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:30:17 2015 UTC,"Waterslides being more popular surprises me. In my experience, Team Roller Coaster immediately had 4 players found each round and we always had to wait 30 seconds to 1 minute to be matched with 4 (sometimes fewer) Team Waterslide members. It gave the distinct impression that Team Waterslide had seriously fewer players.  Why can't Nintendo just assign us to a team to eliminate the popular vote and judge us on skill alone? If needed, they could make the team themes even less interesting so no kids throw a fit at not getting to vote."
splatoon,3dt4kr,Aurarus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:49:08 2015 UTC,"Even less interesting? What did you have in mind, mashed peas vs. boiled broccoli?"
splatoon,3dt4kr,mothernaturer,2,Sun Jul 19 10:25:48 2015 UTC,"I used that phrasing in case someone would fight with me that he needed to be Team Waterslide or Team Dog or whatever.   Yeah, truth be told, it doesn't matter what team we're on and it was poor planning for Nintendo give us a voting booth that creates lopsided teams.  Instead, duplicate the huge Amiibo box that exists in the plaza, and label it a Transmogrification Chamber. You walk in it and see yourself transformed into a member of one of the two teams. Tah duh! Teams are numerically balanced. Teams could also be balanced based on level the player has achieved, and other player data Nintendo has access to (number of weapons purchased, how leveled up gear is, how far the player has progressed in single-player mode, etc.)."
splatoon,3dt4kr,NakedSandvich,2,Sun Jul 19 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not fighting with you, and I appreciate the amount of thought you've put into this, but I'm exactly the type of person who appreciates Nintendo's way of thinking on this sort of thing.  It feels good to fight for something, even if it's just cosmetic, and being a part of Homogenized Auto-Balanced Team A or B wouldn't be fun to me.  I'm sure I'd have played in the first Splatfest just to see what it was all about, but I didn't even use all my Super Sea Snails from that event, and if there hadn't been a fun new theme, there would have been no reason for me to come back for the second one.  When you remove the silly theme, it's just an invitation to grind all day long.  I don't understand why winning/losing is so important to people in a video game. Splatoon even gives a generous consolation prize to the losing team, so you're never shut out.  It's for little more than bragging rights, and bragging rights are pretty meaningless when you're part of such a huge team.  I feel confident in saying that although my individual win percentage was higher than my team's win percentage, that among such a huge group of people my individual contributions were essentially meaningless, and if I hadn't shown up to fight yesterday the results for everyone else most likely would have been no different.  In fact, I ran some quick calculations, and assuming there were only 1,000 other players on my team (which seems low to me; Splatoon has shifted nearly half a million copies in North America as of about a month ago), and the average number of matches played by my teammates was 30, then my wins would have only bumped our victory percentage by 0.0187%.  That percentage decreases the more the number of actual players and actual matches climbs, or increases when the number of actual players and actual matches declines.  Assuming the average number of matches stays constant at 30, then for my individual w/l to have moved the team's w/l by an entire half a percentage point, there would have needed to be no more than 36 other players on my team.  Essentially, it can be mathematically proven that my kickass performance didn't matter to anyone but me.  Also, this means that if we removed player choice and were assigned to teams automatically, everyone with a good win percentage who was randomly assigned to the losing team would have an even more legitimate reason to complain than the losers under the current model.  At least this way, players get to pick a side, and the difference between winning and losing is the choice that they made, even if they couldn't base that choice on anything but personal preference and/or gut instinct.  But if you were automatically assigned to the team that ultimately loses, then you never had any opportunity to win, and the decision was made for you at the moment you signed up.  Might as well just flip a coin."

After splatfest I wanted to give these weapons collecting dust another try .   The Dynamo is probably the hardest one to handle , I assumed at first it was like a regular roller but it's way too slow to just run over people . It's all about the flick , treat it like a carbon roller and you'll get instakills .   The Luna Blaster I used for Tower Control . It's my favorite blaster so far I just wish it had a better special .   The regular blaster is the better one , with the disruptor sub you can shoot it at enemies to slow them down and it also works like a point sensor .   If you're curious about my gear abilities , Ive been using one tenacity and two damage . The last image are the trail boots and its ability is Ink Recovery , I use it only with rollers and chargers ."

splatoon,3dxon8,Huawij,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:22:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that specials are very useful, but I'm not sure if tenacity is the best skill to build up your meter. For example, I'm currently using the contact lenses, which have a main ability that builds up the special meter faster. I've never tested how fast tenacity accumulates points for your special, but I am questioning whether it is faster than special charge up (not sure if that's the correct name, but I'm sure you know of which ability I am talking)."
splatoon,3dxon8,squaswin,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:22 2015 UTC,"I would think the charge up would be faster since tenacity activates only when your teammates die . I actually have the baseball jersey and that's it main ability , but I haven't used it by itself  ...so I need to try it out again ."

When it comes to ranked mode I don't think the Kraken is a great special so they're easy to deal with, but the burst bombs ones are the most difficult to deal with."
splatoon,3dwlyy,Zappangon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:40:42 2015 UTC,"I've played against a few decent e-liters, and then I've also played with a couple ""god-like"" e-liters that literally leave no enemy alive. Only reason I say ""god-like"" is because those e-liters I've played with not only have precise aiming, but also great reflexes and quick reaction times. Those 2 traits combined on a charger main spells a recipe for disaster for the opposing team. Taking a e-liter head on alone is just suicide, and the only ways you'd be able to take out a e-liter is either rushing in with a teammate and have one of you distract the e-liter while the other goes in for the kill, or straight up out-class him with a e-liter or splatterscope.  The only time an e-liter becomes a real threat is mid to endgame, since they've settled in their nesting spot and already have a feel of the flow of the match. Since they already have a long ranged weapon that splats better than most chargers, the best opportunity to trip up a e-liter would be to quickly flank their nesting spot with nades or something that hits far and keep them on their toes. They also won't have their kraken ability just yet so killing the e-liter early on in the beginning of the match is the best and optimal way to ensure that your teammates won't be pressured back by the e-liter.  Just my 2 cents."
splatoon,3dwlyy,Dylthenoise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"The Kraken can swim no faster than an inkling squid. RUN, and attack when it wears off. That should be fairly easy, as E-Liters are not proficient at melee range."

splatoon,3dwlyy,ailes_grises,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:40 2015 UTC,In my opinion only close range attack weapons should have the Kraken (rollers and brushes). An ability for squids that can't reach long distances while attacking.
splatoon,3dwlyy,Poksonkirmar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:52 2015 UTC,"Well, it's your fault for closing in when it's hair glows.  The Custom E-Liter suffers from lacking the amazing Burst Bombs or Echolocator, but it can easily set up camp with Beakons and take care close-range with the Kraken. Just get it when it needs to reload and it's hair isn't glowing (about 3 shots per tank with 1 ink saver main), and it's as easy as that. It can't retaliate.  Frankly, it having the Kraken isn't very ridiculous because otherwise it can't do anything at close-range. The normal one at least has the Burst Bombs to help mid-to-close range. It makes sense to have a Kraken when it also has Beakons. If it had something like an Inkstrike, or an Inkzooka... well, it has nothing for close range, then."

splatoon,3dwlyy,thefreightrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:35 2015 UTC,"What stage you having trouble on?  Close in when the E-Liter looks elsewhere, and try to get the jump on him without alerting him. Hopefully, he can't Kraken up in time."

splatoon,3dwlyy,Poksonkirmar,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:14 2015 UTC,He was everywhere. He wasn't dumb enough to stay in one spot for long.  And I was using the N-Zap 89  but it's not like I could switch loadouts  while staying in the lobby. :(
splatoon,3dwlyy,ikagun,5,Mon Jul 20 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"N-Zap '89 and a moving E-Liter   Eeeeuuugh, yea, there's very little you can do, at least on your own. Inkstrikes can force a move or create an opening, but it's all risky. I'm guessing he wasn't broadcasting his position much then, hiding his laser behind obstacles then popping out to shoot you and your teammates. Keep this in mind: if he's using his Kraken, take that as a victory, because that's time he can't shoot. Try and instigate it and then run away. If you really want to keep him out of the equation, shadow his movements, since he can't fire quickly.   If you splat him, good, but he will respawn and you've lost track of him. If you keep forcing him to relocate through pursuit, you're effectively nullified in the match--but so is he, and given that he's an E-Liter, it's definitely a boon for your team. Of course, expect teammates to come to his aid as well if you try that, either purposefully or inadvertently. Simply making it so he cannot target your teammates is as effective as splatting him, I cannot stress that enough. Keeping the pressure on a sniper so that they cannot fire allows your teammates to move forward, or at least have the opportunity to, and as they do, it puts the charger in a more difficult position as your teammates will be much more mobile in their own ink.  (Of course, if your teammates are losing the 3-on-3 to the rest of the opponents, you're probably out of luck.)  Additionally, you can use the Sprinkler as a ""dummy"" target that he has to decide if it's worth it to spend a shot on, or let it spread ink on the turf he's targeting (if you know or guess his position). Alternatively, try and toss the Sprinkler very close to him - at worst, he'll have to take a moment to deal with it, possibly expending a shot, and at best, he won't notice and as it activates might even splat him. That sprinkler is very useful for an N-Zap, I've seen it used like a Splash Wall in that it's placed between the N-Zap player and whoever is shooting at him, allowing him a quick getaway.  A final bet is taking on the area with teammates and either being somewhat sneaky with them as a distraction, or playing the distraction so that they, hopefully with better equipment, can take him out. His long reload time is something you should try to exploit.  As a comparison, I started off playing Jet Squelcher and focused on support and anti-sniper, to some success (based on teams and maps; I've since begun branching out), so I had a wall to keep me from getting shot in aggro, and a long range to even the odds. Snipers and Gold Dynamos I focused on taking out, so it's very much based around weapon roles here, and most short range weapons simply aren't up to taking on a well positioned E-Liter.  Just remember: You don't need to splat an E-Liter (or other charger) to take them out of the game, simply making it impossible to hunker down and charge their shots effectively nullifies them."

splatoon,3dtz7v,SilentHillRadio,2,Sun Jul 19 18:14:14 2015 UTC,I will happily give Spyke all my money. I just want the option to not let him harm my snails.

Unless that changed after the first Splatfest. But you also have to note, you have to be level 20 to pay in coins."
splatoon,3dtz7v,Burrit0burger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"There can be a prize and motivation while it's just for fun. It's a game, it's supposed to be fun even if you take it seriously. I don't think anyone wouldn't play if they weren't having fun.  It's a friendly competition to have fun. Sure we compete, but we're supposed to have fun doing so. I think ""just for fun"" can be taken in two ways. One is the extreme ""only for fun"" and the other is ""ultimately it's for fun, even if it is a competition."" It's like any other competition. You go to have fun, even if there is a prize and you're competing seriously.   I guess to wrap up my point, even if you're competing, the main goal of Splatfest to have fun, not be focused on winning. You can focus on winning, but if you're not having fun playing, then why are you playing?  I hope I don't sound defensive or aggressive, this is just my take on Splatfest and why I think ""just for fun"" can be taken two different ways. I think you bring up a valid point that it is a competition, but I don't know if it's worth creating negative rivalries in the subreddit over an opinion on a topic that isn't right or wrong."
splatoon,3dtz7v,TigeronStarfire,4,Sun Jul 19 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"i make the statement mostly because ""Splatfests are just for fun"" is often used around here to handwave the justified feelings of a losing team because popularity is too big of a deciding factor in determining a winner.  i dont disagree that those who play it purely for prizes are going in with the wrong mindset."
splatoon,3dtz7v,balefrost,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok, I see what you're saying and completely agree with you.  It's completely ok to be upset you lost and it being ""just for fun"" shouldn't demerit that at all. Same with popularity, both can take the fun out of it. Just a lot of the extreme complaining that's mostly bashing the other teams is unnecessary. There's a line where it becomes too much. At that point it being ""just for fun"" does make a difference.  But yeah, like you said, just because it's a game and it's supposed to be fun doesn't waive or void allowing people to be upset about it."
splatoon,3dtz7v,milehightechie,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"I find splat fest tedious and boring. It's no different than turf wars, except you're forced into wearing a shirt you don't want, you can't play with your friends, you're stuck with the same maps all day, and the servers are worse than any other time. I wi probably not be participating in further splat fests. I already have the gear I want, and over 600k."
splatoon,3dtz7v,aido727,3,Sun Jul 19 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"Like OP said, each of these groups (Dogcoasters, Dogsliders, Catcoasters, and Catsliders), are guilty of spreading bitterness around like it's their birthright.  We should instead of branching off into sub-factions based on our Splatfest choices, should come together as Kids/Squids and make Splatfests something to look forward to.   I feel that shaming those who were on the losing side just creates strife and really doesn't do much else. Especially if one turns the choices they made into a derogatory name to call them."

splatoon,3dtz7v,ikagun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between calling someone upset and someone salty. Salty is a taunting and insulting way of saying upset. Saying someone is upset is objective.  However you aren't even upset. No one should call you salty, you had fun, why would you be salty or upset? Maybe a little upset that you didn't win, but you probably aren't too sad.   Prime example of the problems here. Thank you for sharing these. Hopefully you'll see less of this! :)"
splatoon,3dtz7v,Chezzymann,3,Sun Jul 19 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"It can't be helped. Competitions make people competitive, after all.  Leaderboards, point systems, sinning and losing teams... they all exist and are created with the mindset that people are going to compete in order to be better. Which is a good thing for the fiery spirit. But I will agree, competitions can be taken way too far.  I wish we could go through one splatfest and forget about the team representation afterwards. But of course, I go through this sub and other places and people are still toting dog and cat tags, claiming either their team rules or their team deserved the win. I wouldn't be surprised if we went through 100 splatfests and a group of people will be like ""Hey, remember when Eating kicked Sleeping's ass? That was great.""  This sense of devoting yourself to a team that is long-gone isn't right. Splatfest is about pledging yourself to a team for 24 hours and forgetting about it. But the results will always be burned into everyone's memories, because people can be so die-hard to a team or cause that even after team Dog won and team Cats lost, they'll still bicker about it.  It's for that reason I will always despise people who still shit on everyone by bragging that their team won 30 weeks ago. It's in the past, it doesn't fucking matter. But that competitive nature keeps the spirit alive, keeps telling them ""I won and everyone else sucks"" because it's so damn fulfilling that they wouldn't care to move on.  Maybe I'm wrong and this won't happen, but based on these new dogcoasters, catslides, dogslides, catcoasters... it seems like we're moving in that direction. And as long as people don't stop bickering about 24 hour fun events, we'll never recover."
splatoon,3dtz7v,abunnyleaps,3,Sun Jul 19 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"Splatfest can still be competitive and be fun.  :)  Speaking as a Cat Slider, although I was more upset with the popularity spread in Dogs vs Cats, I'm happy the less popular team won this time.  It makes the cats feel like it is a mountain that can be climbed, like a challenge that has to be surmounted if you want to take the prize (a few extra sea snails, and bragging rights).  Honestly, getting to King rank both times, I don't really feel like I've lost much.  I got 36 snails for my time and effort, so I'm still fine with the shakedown.  And in some ways, it's almost like a badge of honor, knowing that I've fought that fight, taken the rub, but I still get up and splat with the best of them, simply because it IS fun.  I enjoy ""Booyah!ing"" all over the place, from the start of the match as my battle cry to rouse my teammates, to every splat I make against the opposing team.  :)  Labels don't have to divide us.  We're all kids and squids in the end, but the sides we choose mean something as they are things we identify with, love, and fight for to win the fest.  It gives us a sort of camaraderie with our fellow squidlings, and I love that.    Salt will probably be with us in any loss.  But a lot of us accept it, move on, and splat some more.  No biggie.  There's plenty of snail-o-vera to spread around.  :)"

And yeah I may make a celebratory post about it, not to rub it in or down-talk the losing side, but just out of excitement and way to congratulate my fellow team mates (although I haven't yet).  I do feel bad for the losing team, but I haven't really seen that much trash talking on here."
splatoon,3dtz7v,matroe11,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"The sentiment is agreeable but I feel most of the salt comes from the flawed scoring system.  Short version: popularity has way too much sway over the final result. A lot of people feel that upping the battle % to x4 or x5 instead of only x2 would help. Yes, Team Eating would have still won (because the voting was so heavily one sided) but it wouldn't have been the total landslide it was.  People on the losing sides feel hard done by, thus generating salt, by the system itself. It's as if the winner is a 50/50 choice you make a week before the actual event and all your actual efforts on the day don't add up to anything at all.  tl;dr: the current scoring system does not lend itself to fairness and fun, it is just a popularity contest"

splatoon,3dui0g,h2g2guy,6,Sun Jul 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"I can agree with this. I just think the weights should be adjusted, since the method right now means that it's basically impossible for a less popular team to win if the popularity gap has one team over 58% or so. I don't mind it figuring in, but I wish that we had the possibility for more than one ""underdog"" win out of six."
splatoon,3dui0g,snarkysquid,8,Sun Jul 19 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like them to add a 3rd poll for the number of king/queens made for each team, that way players who really put in time can affect the outcome."

splatoon,3dui0g,snarkysquid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"Out of all suggested ideas, this one is a really great one. It's another metric for 'participation' to add on to the 'wins'. So you have 2 out of 3 of the metrics be for actual participating and it dilutes the 'popularity' metric a little bit more.  Such a shame that it'll probably never happen."
splatoon,3dui0g,Rapptz,4,Mon Jul 20 06:43:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is just that there is a big incentive to being on the winning side, so people will stop picking based on what they like and will start picking based on which they think will win. There's a difference between a popularity contest, and a contest to determine what people think is more popular.  Like, if I asked a room full of people, do you like dogs or cats more, some people would say dogs and some people would say cats. If I asked that same room ""Which do you think is more popular, dogs or cats?"" Then almost everyone who's being honest about it will say dogs. That's where the splatfests are going if they keep popularity in there, and it will take all of the fun out of the splatfests themselves.  That said, even if they do remove popularity from splatfests, the players in the major competitive communities will eventually start collaborating to make one of the teams stronger. Like, if everyone from 4chan, reddit, and squidboards all joined one of the teams, then the other team would get absolutely crushed in win-rate. And there's an incentive to do that, because wins translates directly into rewards.  Splatfests are fun, and I've loved the ones we've had so far, but it's not going to last forever. The incentives to win are going to force people to pick teams to win, rather than for the fun of the contest. The only real way to fix the problem is to remove the incentive for being on the winning side, and just make the prize bragging rights. If they do that, everything else will work itself out."
splatoon,3dui0g,therationalpi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:15 2015 UTC,"While I see your point here, I think a tweaking of the rules will fix the first problem (using a 4x win% multiplier, for example), and the massive amount of people playing will solve the second (until the game's popularity tapers off).    We probably have at least 200,000 people who participated in some way or another in the US Splatfests, and probably quite a bit more in Japan.  The forces of actually good players that places like Reddit, 4chan, and squidboards could mobilize probably number in the hundreds or very low thousands... and good luck getting Reddit and 4chan on the same page.  But even if they did all get on the same page, we have soooo many people playing this game that their impact would still be rather minimal, at best.  To overcome a significant popularity difference, even with a higher multiplier, means changing over 4-5% of games, which I don't think a couple of online communities could really manage (especially since the game is not wholly popularity based, but depends on the skill of the players, as well).  Now, once Splatfests get less popular and we have only thousands or tens of thousands of players, I think this will start to become a rather big problem.  But for now, I think we'll be alright. :)"
splatoon,3dui0g,therationalpi,3,Mon Jul 20 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, it doesn't actually require that fan communities get involved. The push to be on the winning side will cause any halfway serious player to start picking not based on what they like, but on what they think will be popular. This will cause runaway popularity votes, and also higher winrates for that side because the less serious players will be the ones picking based on personal preference."
splatoon,3dui0g,therationalpi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fair. Like I said in my original reply, though, I think that can be significantly outweighed if we increase the multiplier for the win percentage."
splatoon,3dui0g,therationalpi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:13 2015 UTC,"So, to get the right multiplier, we want the standard deviations to be the same. My guess is that the standard deviation for popularity is about 15% (~68% of splatfests will have the winning side with between 65-50% of the total votes), while the standard deviation for winrate is probably around 2%. That means that you need to make winrate worth 8 times more than popularity for both metrics to have an equal pull on which side wins."
splatoon,3dui0g,ReleaseTheBogus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"The actual population standard deviations (to 2 s.f.) for popularity and win percentage are 12 percentage points and 3.1 percentage points respectively, making the correct multiplier 3.9.  I have reservations about this method for determining the multiplier, however, because of the nature of this kind of data (which is guaranteed to have a particular mean).    And regardless of what the math says, I think this should be tweaked in a way that seems fair, rather than what actually is mathematically an equal weighting.  For example, we may want to give win percentage more pull than popularity (which seems to be what a lot of people want, anyway)."
splatoon,3dui0g,furious_20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:17 2015 UTC,"I wasn't going off of the sample standard deviation, because the sample size is currently too small to be meaningful. I was just basing it on my own intuition (which could be refined once we have enough meaningful data).  And while I see your point about just making it ""seem"" fair, I think we can both agree that right now popularity has a much more pronounced effect than win rate, which is frustrating to a lot of people."
splatoon,3dui0g,ArabIDF,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"Im fine with popularity in splatfests. Sure it can be annoying, but at the same time its clear that a lot of people like something more than someone else. And the reward werther you win or lose is good either way. People who fight for what they like and believe in, they voted for X. You dont complain when the guy you didnt want wins an election.  (okay a bunch of people do)"
splatoon,3dui0g,ArabIDF,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"I second this. It's a way to engage the community and reward people with sea shells for a friendly competition. I like popularity being a factor, especially since if your team is more popular by a large margin you'll end up playing more scrimmages."
splatoon,3dui0g,inklebop,2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"If it were, teams wouldn't 'stand' for anything, would be evenly matched, and would be randomly selected so that each side has to prove their worth. The event would be structured in a way to answer the question ""Are Green or Purple players better?"", rather than ""Are Rollercoasters or Water Slides better?"" These inklings are playing for a cause, not personal glory   Not seeing your logic here. If they're playing for a cause shouldn't it be better that the winner be decided so through skill and not popularity? Simply casting a vote isn't playing for anything, and it's not very fun in a video game. So I don't think it should count for anything."
splatoon,3dui0g,MastuDenton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way:    Let's say we wanted to decide whether Red or Blue was a 'superior color'.  99% of people choose Red, while 1% chooses Blue, but Blue wins 51% of matches in an unrelated sporting event.  When deciding in an arbitrary sense which one of the two is 'superior', isn't it a bit disingenuous to completely ignore Red's popularity?  And I do feel the need to point out that, while these inklings are playing for a cause, there's no material reward involved.  There's no real, concrete benefits that rollercoasters now have except... bragging rights, I guess?  Not sure how rollercoasters can brag, but w/e. (Yes, inklings do get differing material rewards, but remember that the inklings are not fighting for their own glory.)"
splatoon,3dui0g,UnionJames,3,Mon Jul 20 00:02:53 2015 UTC,"In that scenario why even have a sporting event at all if you're not going to give the award to the blue players who won?   I don't see the point of mixing a popularity contest with a contest. If you want to determine which colour is liked by the most people- have a vote. If you want to determine who is better at Splatoon, people who like blue or people who like red, have a contest.   What purpose does mixing the two serve except invalidating the results of the contest, ruining the spirit of the competition? It just sucks the fun out of it.   And again this is a video game, a third person shooter. I'd rather the results be decided by third person shooting than a vote or a mix of the two. Like imagine if they started taking cheering into account during baseball games. The Blue Jays won against the Yankees at Yankee stadium, but the Yankees were given the ultimate win because the crowd cheered for them louder. Lame, right?    And I do feel the need to point out that, while these inklings are playing for a cause, there's no material reward involved.

splatoon,3dui0g,BigMattyKane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:08 2015 UTC,"In that scenario why even have a sporting event at all if you're not going to give the award to the blue players who won?   Because in the case of a reasonably large victory, the popularity results are overruled.  Also, you missed the whole point of what I was trying to say here:  the players do not win or lose.  The colors do.     And again this is a video game, a third person shooter. I'd rather the results be decided by third person shooting than a vote or a mix of the two.    I'm giving a possible in-universe explanation as to why Splatfests are structured this way.  You're looking at this from an out-of-universe perspective, which is totally valid, but not what I'm driving at here.   Like imagine if they started taking cheering into account during baseball games. The Blue Jays won against the Yankees at Yankee stadium, but the Yankees were given the ultimate win because the crowd cheered for them louder. Lame, right?   That's the point of the 'no material reward' thing that I said.  The Yankees and the Blue Jays have their own glory and team record at stake.  The inklings don't, because each Splatfest finds each inkling on a new and different team that didn't exist before, and won't exist after.    I do want to mention again that I think the win percentage should be given a higher multiplier.  After thinking about it these past couple of days, I think a 4x multiplier would be appropriate, because that would mean that a difference of 40% in popularity (which we've almost seen) could be overridden by a difference of 10% in win percentage (which we've actually seen).  Still maintains a meaningful popularity presence, while allowing for easier (and more reasonable) upsets by win percentage."

splatoon,3dws9j,ThorTheNintendoGuy,16,Mon Jul 20 04:33:36 2015 UTC,I'd personally prefer if Splatoon was just a game instead of a marketing tool for other products.

splatoon,3dws9j,stactup,9,Mon Jul 20 07:11:32 2015 UTC,"May as well since these are pretty inconsequential, and the added revenue can only help cover cost of future development. Not like head over heels about the idea as a consumer, but I'm not against it either and wouldn't be that annoyed by a Nacho Cheese vs Cool Ranch Doritos Splatfest.   I feel like anyone against this falls into the cynical ""capitalism is bad!"" crowd. Nobody is saying you have to buy these products, and the themes would be no less important than ""rollercoaster vs waterslide"" or ""eating vs sleeping"", lol."

splatoon,3dws9j,worthyoflove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:54 2015 UTC,"I do wanna note that I don't think it'd be like Nacho Cheese vs Cool Ranch, based on what we know about the Japanese product placement. I mean, the Maruchan noodlefest could be boiled down to Soba vs Udon (or Tanuki vs Kitsune) and the Kirin teafest can be boiled down to Milk tea vs Lemon tea. If you ignore the branding, they're somewhat generic themes.  With this in mind, I propose Lays potato chips vs Doritos corn chips."
splatoon,3dws9j,snarkysquid,4,Mon Jul 20 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"Everyone I've seen suggesting this is using products that people tend to have very strong brand loyalties to (e.g. Coke or Pepsi) as examples. In reality, sponsored Splatfests would be boring, because you know who doesn't need to buy ads in a video game? Products to which people have strong brand loyalties.   We would get one, maybe two themes that were even slightly interesting (think Team F-150 and Team Focus) and then it would end up being things nobody here cares about. Which Garnier Fructis shampoo is your ""mane weapon?"" Do you use Sleek and Shine to manage flyaways like Callie, or do you keep it simple with 2-in-1 like Marie? Represent your favorite Febreeze scent...are you a fresh and fruity Strawberry and Fig, or a cool and crisp Clean Linen? Team Penne or Team Linguine? This Splatfest brought to you by Barilla Pasta: Ride the Walrus.  It's clearly coming, like it or not, but I would prefer to delay the inevitable monetization of Splatfest for as long as possible. It's not like rollercoasters or waterslides is one of the weighty questions of our time or anything, but trust me, you will not enjoy sponsored Splatfests."

splatoon,3dw1zs,Pokemonriley245,6,Mon Jul 20 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah save E-Liter for when you get good. Start with one of the Splatterscopes and just keep doing your best, then move on to Splat Chargers or the E-Liters. That's essentially what I did and now I'm better than most snipers I've encountered.   Just try to be stealthy and learn when to retreat and come up with a better strategy."

splatoon,3dw1zs,Zappangon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:28 2015 UTC,I mainly use splatterscope on -2.5 camera sensitivity to compensate for the lack of visibility when aiming from afar.
splatoon,3dw1zs,frozenpandaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:55:12 2015 UTC,Why one of the scope variants?
splatoon,3dw1zs,UnapologeticxBitch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"It makes targeting easier and its charge time is way better than the E-Liter's. I'm not saying you have to start with it, it's just what worked for me and many other people."
splatoon,3dw1zs,Gigafrost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:27:26 2015 UTC,"May be a good idea to get used to shooting straight with a shooter first. My favorite in that regard is the .96 Gal which gets you closer to thinking like a Charger but the Squelchers are good for ranged shooting as well of course.  (The loadout of the .96 Gal, Sprinker + Echolocation, will be similar to the Kelp chargers, I think, so it might also serve as a good transition in that regard.)"
splatoon,3dw1zs,fatuousEpithet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"Point away from people so they don't know you're aiming at them, then snap it to them right as you shoot. It's a lot easier to hit when they're not making evasive maneuvers. For this reason, a scope might not be too good, at least for me."
splatoon,3dw1zs,fatuousEpithet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:36:24 2015 UTC,Definitely use Splat Bombs if you're using standard Charger/Splatterscope. You can defend yourself on high ground by rolling them just off the ledge. (I'm thinking about Blackbelly Skatepark here) I get so many surprise kills this way.
splatoon,3dw1zs,SpyroFan-17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"As a Squiffer user, I respect E-Liter users because they can deal with that longer charge time. I read that it's best to stay just behind the frontlines, and fire from a distance."
splatoon,3dw1zs,pbzeppelin1977,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"As a charger you can also support your team mates in some ways. Like laying down a line of ink for a short range team mate to get closer to their target. Cutting off the enemy's escape route with a line of ink.  Laying down a line of ink to stop enemy advancement, even if they advance you'll see them because they'll either jump over the line or try to clear it, this will give you and your team mates a heads up and make sure there aren't any nasty surprises waiting ahead.  If you can help it, try not to stand with your laser hovering around the place, people will see it and make special attempts to avoid it while getting close to you, some people are very effective at this. Hide in the ink, and when they are concentrating on doing something else, splat them. Don't point your crosshair right at them while you're charging up, they will see the laser, aim it somewhere they won't notice.  Sometimes you may just need to intimidate instead of splatting, use your laser for that."

splatoon,3dw1zs,MuteBard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:20 2015 UTC,"Train yourself to release the fire button (ZR) when you see the crosshairs turn into an X.  Have good spatial awareness. Don't let people sneak up on you! Know where the enemy is at all times. Related to the point above: Don't get into close quarters combat if possible! We're horrible at close range. Use whatever you can (your sub wep, your special) to avoid getting into these situations. You don't need a full charge to kill! This is especially true for the E-Liter. iirc my Kelp Splat Charger takes around 3/4 to splat somebody. This can be very helpful to know if you do happen to get into close quarters combat. Track or flick? Pick your style. Do you like trying to aim at a target (tracking)? Or do you like moving the crosshairs in the enemy's direction and releasing when you see the X? (flicking, not sure of a better term for this. There was a video on this subreddit with someone who is really good at this.) Once you seem to be good enough at chargers w/ Scope, then you should be moving up to regular chargers. (if you can't cope without a scope, that's okay, you can stick with it!)  Once you're even better, then you can start charging while aiming at a wall to hide your laser then quickly move the crosshairs to an enemy when you see them.
