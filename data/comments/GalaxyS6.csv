GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,shankinstuff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Looks like these got a seal of approval.

I think they're just trying to communicate that it is only a cable and doesn't have the wall wart included.  I've used these cables in Samsung, Motorola, and LG cell chargers with zero issues.    Honestly, the only ""downside"" to these cables is that they're so beefy that anyone who tends to be absentminded runs the risk of ruining their charging port.  The teeth-thingies (technical term) on the micro end are very sturdy and the connection is rock solid.  If you have to grab your phone and dash away in a hurry but forget to unplug it, goodbye phone USB port.  So...don't do that."

GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,HaxDBHeader,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:40 2015 UTC,Theres alot of good cables out there and its hard to say which but all you have to do is remember a few things:   24AWG Power lines Durability of terminals (usb ends) Length: 1m (3.28 ft) or less Reasonable Price   The rest is up to you. ( in terms of design or etc)  I would also like to say that avoid flat cables because its geometry renders it vulnerable for breaking easily.

GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,HoofaKingFarted,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:08 2015 UTC,This is good advice.  One of the things I've found super interesting is that plugging this phone into the various chargers I have always yields a different estimate until charged.  Sometimes charge times vary by as much as two hours!  And that's without fast charging.
GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,HoofaKingFarted,3,Tue Jul 21 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"Yes it does affect your charge time too because some wall chargers give less than 2.1A.   Fast charging is 9V, 1.7A or 5V, 2.1A; this means that for example you have a power bank with an output of 5V, 2.1A it will fast charge your galaxy S6 even if it does not say ""Fast charging"" on your device."
GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,Wu-Tang_Cam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:42 2015 UTC,"That makes sense now. I was fed up with my phone and cable getting hot when using the fast charger, so I switched to the S5 charger which is 2.1A, 5V but the phone and cable were still hot."

GalaxyS6,3e1ozy,phamous,2,Tue Jul 21 08:08:02 2015 UTC,My speculation base on your observation is that you have a faulty cable. Try a different usb cable ( small in length and as much as possible new )   I assume you are using stock adaptive fast charging brick and cable from samsung right?  If it does still show the message it may be your wall charger that is broken but i highly doubt it.

Root is the difference between user access (like a standard user in Windows), and admin access. A rooted phone has access to deeper levels of folders where system files can be found and altered. The bootloader will even allow loading of a modified OS.

My personal preference, coming from a fully stock setup, is to download a custom ROM and a custom kernel to your device's internal memory, flash TWRP via Odin, IMMEDIATELY reboot into recovery after that flash (letting it boot normally will boot the stock system, it'll notice a custom recovery, and reflash the stock recovery), do a full backup, wipe the phone (factory reset under twrp + manually format system), install the rom, then install the kernel, then reboot.

GalaxyS6,3dyowz,WelcomeToBoshwitz,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"Pretend your phone is your computer. Your Rom is your operating system, like windows 8 or OSX. Well you can get apps that run programs like chrome and skype. Thats what you get from the playstore.  But what if you wanted to change and customize more of your computer. Like what if you wanted to change the color of the date and time on your system's taskbar. Well those apps would require access to more of the computer's core operating system than the app that runs skype, since skype isn't modifying the operating system while the other app would modify it. One of the frameworks that lets people edit the operating system stuff is called Xposed but it needs to be programmed to your computer or it'll mess things up. We're looking for coders that can help do that."
GalaxyS6,3dyowz,Dzmagoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"Xposed allowed for specific tweaks that provide functionality beyond what apps can do alone. And because these overlay the OS itself, they can be much more integrated.   A rom would be as if you ran a pre-tweaked version of the OS, but you're limited to the tweaks that are built into the rom."

My S6 Edge charges 40-50% during my 60 minute commute home every day (with a quick charger), and that's with navigation on the entire time and full screen brightness.   I have a 128 GB Edge, so storage isn't an issue. Plus, obviously you can't be charging and accessing the SD card at the same time. My main reason for wanting lots of storage space is for music, so if I was running low on power, and streaming music that was stored on the SD card, I'd have to stop the music to charge the phone. For me, that would just be silly.   Bottom line, when it's on sale in 3-4 months for $45, I may bite."

This was my first touchwiz experience and thought everyone on Reddit was crazy to bitch about it.  A month later I started understanding the hate for touchwiz. Multitasking is crazy bad. On multiple occasions it has even closed my music app. Lag is everywhere. Opening app switching apps in app performance I set lag everywhere. You will see a popular post here of comparison of Nexus 5/6 scrolling comparison to this phone. Battery life not good either. I am not a vanilla OS lover. Love HTC sense UI. But Samsung here has made some grave mistakes with a very expensive phone.  I am still holding on to it coz the camera is amazing. Also love fingerprint sensor and wireless charging.

GalaxyS6,3dudv8,nickm_27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"I still own it. It's a great phone - the best camera, the best screen, decent battery life. If you're an audiphile, you'll be pleased to know that the S6 outputs the best sound quality of any Android phone to date (including HTC M8/M9) because of an amazing Wolfson DAC.  Just don't expect anything exciting, especially if you are into custom ROMs. The S6/S6 edge ROM scene is so dead it makes me sad. It is an upgrade for sure, but not a groundbreaking one. If your phone is from around the Nexus 5 era, you're better off waiting.  I would recommend the upcoming OnePlus Two. From what OnePlus and MKBHD have told us, it has a great battery (~3300 MAh), a really good camera (source: MKBHD's videos), an HD or QHD display (it doesn't make a difference, I could barely tell the difference from my N5 and S6 unless I was looking at black colors), USB Type-C, a stunning look and feel. The fingerprint sensor will be over 2x faster than the S6 or iPhone. It'll have 4GB of RAM and an updated version of the Snapdragon 810. And OnePlus says it'll be around $400; my S6 was almost $900!  And you can apply for an invite for it on July 27th. They'll be selling 30-50x more phones at the start, this time around."

GalaxyS6,3dudv8,cjeremy,3,Sun Jul 19 17:06:09 2015 UTC,I haven't paid too much attention to the battery since with my N5 I got into the habit of charging whenever I could so I haven't had the chance to go from 100->0 on the S6 yet. Right now it's at 72% after about 4 hours of use with 75mins of SoT and 30mins of music using an equalizer. Nothing groundbreaking but given that my N5 would be <20% already it's refreshing.  I did have to pay $7.50 for Titanium Backup though to freeze one of the KNOX apps that was causing nearly 100% wake time. I doubt the average user would know to do this.

GalaxyS6,3dwnnq,ARCHA1C,4,Mon Jul 20 03:57:24 2015 UTC,Isn't the rumored Note 5 event just a few weeks away? There will also be a larger S6 Edge announced at the same time. I'd definitely wait.

Especially when everyone at work comments how good this phone looks compared to their iPhones.   And it is so smooth!! And get Reddit Sync, it really is the best reddit app for android IMO!  so, just so you can have the positive experience I have had, get the S6 Edge. I agree with other commenters that the battery life is pretty pedestrian. I have a power pack I take with me (tecknet thingy from amazon) which charges my phone over 2 full charges on one battery).   If you use your phone more than 4 hours screentime per day then  perhaps the S6 family isn't for you, and you should look at the note for the extra battery capacity.   What I've found in the S6 is that it really is a phone, with all the features. It has the battery life of a phone. If you want all these features AND battery life, you need to get a phablet or tablet. (But you lose portability with bigger devices!)"

GalaxyS6,3dufd1,BoomBabyDaggers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry I guess that's what I did, not completely uninstall. I did install Facebook Lite which doesn't give notifications or anything, I'm almost certain it's just the web version in a container, and started using Disa instead of messenger. Gets the job done but I do miss chat heads and a couple other small things."
GalaxyS6,3dufd1,BeefMitts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:29 2015 UTC,There is definitely something wrong. I get 0 lag and don't reboot my device for 2 days at a time. I would suggest downloadin a RAM manager to see what's causing your phone to lag. If you have around 700mb-1gb free of RAM then its probably a software issue. Or the Android version. 5.0.2 is a mess.

GalaxyS6,3ds4zj,AndriodScrub,8,Sat Jul 18 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"For customisation.  Download a different launcher from the Play Store. These change the way your phone works/looks/feels. Nova, Hola, Smart, Action, Google Now: pretty much all the top launchers are better than the standard. I personally recommend Nova Launcher  Also, search ""icon packs"" in the Play Store. Take a look through them and download the ones you like. I can't speak for other launchers, but on Nova you long-press an app, tap 'edit' and pick an icon to change it. If you'd prefer, you can also download images from the web to use as icons.  A widget maker is optional, but recommended for theming. Zooper Widget and KLWP are commonly used. There are also individual widgets, such as Minimal Clock.  Obviously there's the official Theme Store too, but it's pretty dissapointing aside from the material themes and a couple of the darker ones.  That should get you started.

Hold an empty space on your homescreen (TouchWiz) and tap the Widgets button.  ""Location set by GPS"" is Google automatically locating your phone every so often for the Location History. Turn off Location History in the Google Settings if you don't want to be tracked. It also saves a good bit of battery.  The app grid is all of the useable applications that you have on your phone. You put the apps you want to see on the home pages.  I use Reddit Sync for my Android client but there are many others."

GalaxyS6,3ds4zj,blakeman1,2,Sun Jul 19 07:21:56 2015 UTC,"To get widgets, you just press and hold on the home screen and go to widgets and drag it onto the home screen. If you want to download more, you can go to the play store (app store) and download more. Also, a lot of apps you download have a widget function. For example, you can download different calendar apps which work as an app, and you can apply the widget too.  You can't really download most of the apps the come with the phone (like the att apps). You can disable them in the settings, however. But that doesn't delete them. I've used both Tmobile and Verizon android phones and I typically only use the voicemail app and the one that will let you check your account. So you know. Android kind of works like a pc. You have apps and you can move them to your 'desktop'. Removing them from the 'desktop' does not unistall them. Which is also where you get the difference between the main pages and the ""app grid"". Your 'app grid' is the apps you have and the 'main pages' is your desktop.  /u/blakeman1 does explained the location part really well  Cool looking customization. Oh boy haha I don't have much time to explain that, but the best start I can give you is to install Nova Launcher. This will allow you to change your default launcher (desktop) to allow you to customize it more. The best advice I can give is to look up some tutorials. There are A LOT of them on youtube. I can explain more later if you would like.   The best way I can describe the difference between android and iOS is that on iOS if you don't like, too bad. On android, if you don't like it, change it. Don't like the camera? Get a new one, don't like the messenger? Change it. Same for the home screens, web browser, you name it. It's a whole world that will take time to learn a lot. So just enjoy it =) Also, the android community is quite large and typically willing to help, so look things up if you don't understand and ask questions. Welcome! =)"
GalaxyS6,3ds4zj,Drummerguy134,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:39 2015 UTC,I believe the Location set by GPS thing is when it updates your weather forecast on the lock screen. In settings you can change how often it updates the temperature/location
GalaxyS6,3ds4zj,X-Kid86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"You can get more widgets through the app store. Often times new apps that you download will come with their own widget that will be added to the widget menu.  What preinstalled apps you keep enabled is up to you. I disabled most of them. There are usually only one or two I'd keep. Like my AT&T, etc.  I'm not sure why you'd get notifications from apps that have notifications disabled. Did you disable all types of notifications for the app? That just means that the gps is locating your position. Probably because some app needs it. Likely Google Now, but it could be any app that requires your location.  There are a ton of ways to get those customizations. The best is to use a different launcher like Nova launcher. You can edit everything once you install Nova. Animations, app icon sizes, download different app icon packs, features, notification badges, etc. There are a lot more in depth ways to customize like custom roms, but different launchers and themes are enough for most people.  The main pages are sort of like your desktop in Windows. You can add what you want. Just your favorite stuff or a few apps that you use the most or everything. Up to you. The app grid pages (called the app drawer) is just a list of all the apps on your device. Sort of like the program list in Windows.  There's no easy way to move apps around that I know of. I just keep like two on my main page and the app drawer in alphabetical order."

GalaxyS6,3ds4zj,wggn,-12,Sun Jul 19 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"You answered that yourself.  The ones that you use.  Try again.  Google's way of telling you when they're checking up on you.  Using launchers (I recommend Nova) to add gestures and easier customization, widgets and icon packs (change icon pictures).  Don't really know what you mean but will try. The main page, I'm assuming is your home screen. That is your home screen. The app grid is where your apps are. You don't need to put your apps on the homescreen like you do with iPhones, instead you can keep them all in the app grid and access them from there. There are apps that make this easier to do (app dialer).  No? It's the exact same way as an iPhone so I don't really know what your'e talking about here.    Just letting you know as a fellow iPhone --> S6 user, there are literally a billion ""guides"" for you to check out if you use google. Lots of other things will be discovered as you tinker around with your phone.   For the most useful/best apps search /r/Android and you'll find billions of threads over the last 2 years.

GalaxyS6,3dsix7,gedankenreich,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:40:55 2015 UTC,Pocket Casts is the only app I still notice this on and I have tweaked my settings for RAM management which has greatly improved multitasking.

GalaxyS6,3drcjd,tucketnucket,5,Sun Jul 19 08:01:58 2015 UTC,It depends what you want out of the phone. If you want stock Android and fast updates wait for the nexus. If you don't mind OEM skins and want an amazing camera go with the s6 or g4.
GalaxyS6,3drcjd,braydenlarwill,3,Sat Jul 18 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"As someone who went from the OnePlus One, to the GS6 Edge, and now to the LG G4 I would say wait the week and a bit for the OnePlus Two and see how that is. If not, the GS6 is one of the best Android phones I've used to date. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate and the camera is leaps and bounds better than what you're used to having with the Nexus 5."

GalaxyS6,3drcjd,squirrel_uk,3,Sat Jul 18 19:16:24 2015 UTC,Anytime! I would honestly suggest getting the S6 over the Edge. The curve is cool don't get me wrong but it doesn't add much functionality and eventually just become a hassle to hold the phone with
GalaxyS6,3drcjd,braydenlarwill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with this, I had the s6 before and just switched to the edge. It doesn't add any really useful functionality but the phone looks much nicer and swiping left and right on the screen to go back or forwards feels much better. Content also looks better, everything kind of jumps out at you with a 3d effect. That said the standard s6 is more comfortable to hold."

GalaxyS6,3drcjd,kankaswag,2,Sat Jul 18 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on when you're leaving for a different country. The Galaxy Note 5 is rumored to be announced and launched in August (will likely have a way better battery/bigger screen), and the new Nexus phones will likely be out by October. These are all serious contenders for the S6, so you might want to wait if possible.  If you need a new phone right now, then the Galaxy S6 is good for you if you want an amazing camera and really great screen (really good outdoor visibility). However, in terms of battery life, it sometimes struggles to get me through a day without charge, which may be a problem if you're traveling. LG G4 has slightly better battery life, but is also sort of mediocre in that area- and if you like smaller phones, the G4 may not be the one for you. Honestly, as long as you're ok with a very delicate phone that's not a powerhouse in battery, the S6 is your best option. Also, as braydenlarwill said, get the regular S6, the edge is cool and all, but doesn't add anything useful and actually makes the phone worse in some cases (glare from sunlight on the edges, etc)."

But can't really go wrong either way."
GalaxyS6,3drcjd,jakesky100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"If you can wait, i suggest waiting it out.    My nexus died at the end of June and I ended up getting an s6.  The ui is better for touch wiz, but still drops frames for no reason compared to the n5.  Battery life is maybe 10-20% better than the n5, but it's not impressive but any means.  The only saving grace is that the camera is pretty good, but if you were using the n5 for a while, out probably isn't a high priority for you."

You can also order NFC tags on Amazon, Google, or other sites and it will allow you to automate some processes via some apps. I use Trigger. For instance, you can make a tag turn on Bluetooth, turn off WiFi, turn on location, and pull up your music playing app by tapping on one you place in your car. I have one that turns on my Bluetooth, connects to my Bluetooth speaker, and starts playing a playlist."

There are apps out there that will allow you to read the data on you passport. Slowly, the technology is being supported in the real world.  I had the s4 and a mophie juice pack that did not support NFC. I started to have an interest in the technology and was a little bummed that I couldn't make use of NFC. I picked up an s5 and mophie came out with a juice pack that supported NFC passthrough which allowed me to look at more apps that supported the technology. I emailed mophie to ask if they were still going to have NFC passthrough for the s6 Edge. I was quite surprised (but then again I wasn't) when they said the newer juice pack would not have this functionality. At a time when Google, Samsung, and Apple were starting to increase the visibility and use of ""pay with your phone"" functionality, they said no. Sad.  So I guess I vote with my dollars. I don't want to strip the pack off when I want to use NFC so I look at other solutions for portable temporary power. Hopefully mobile pay solutions will really start to take hold enough so that manufacturers like mophie  will have to refigure their support for the technology."

Trick is they take it off the floor and just hide it. Computer goes shit, its been 2 months and this hasn't sold? Shits taking up way too much space. $200 extra discount.

GalaxyS6,3dohya,knockoutking,5,Sat Jul 18 21:02:45 2015 UTC,Just wondering why you would choose this over a zero lemon battery case? I got it for $14. $106 seems like overkill if it's pretty much the same thing?
GalaxyS6,3dohya,dark_roast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:55 2015 UTC,How is that case
GalaxyS6,3dohya,Drayzen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:40:45 2015 UTC,"I'm interested to know this, as well. There are a bunch of $20-$40 battery packs on Amazon with similar specs and designs, and I don't see what the extra $60-$80 gets you."
GalaxyS6,3dohya,dark_roast,5,Sat Jul 18 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"And this is why I'm happy that the phone is smaller. If you want a battery that lasts 2-3 days with heavy usage, you have 3rd party options. I don't need a 3 inch thick phone just to support someone elses ideas of battery life.  I can use mine for 2 hours and get 36-44 hours of standby no problem.   Also, I'm pretty sure I'm going to get downvoted because apparently having battery life that lasts for some undetermined amount of time and forcing the dimension changes on everyone rather than just buying a battery pack as a solution is considered bad."
GalaxyS6,3dohya,Drayzen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that we used to have removable batteries, so you could throw a bigger primary battery on the phone. That's a far more elegant solution.  Without that ability to swap batteries, I'd argue that it's far more important than before to include a large enough internal battery to comfortably last a day."
GalaxyS6,3dohya,dark_roast,0,Sat Jul 18 17:23:16 2015 UTC,I don't agree. They compromise the design of the phone.
GalaxyS6,3dohya,Drayzen,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I for one don't care how the phone looks if it can't last a solid day."

GalaxyS6,3dohya,disabledquarter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'll just buy a ZL or similar extended battery for my S6. Everything else about it is great, they just made it a pain in the ass to get all day battery life."
GalaxyS6,3dohya,alexbhood,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:55 2015 UTC,I went in today to buy this... Realized it was just better to keep the mophie power bank I have.

GalaxyS6,3dohya,alexbhood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:46 2015 UTC,It's 3300mah and I like it better than a second battery device. One fewer thing to carry and no cables etc required to connect. Also protects the factory Micro USB port.
GalaxyS6,3dohya,Michael1521,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:19:33 2015 UTC,"That's weird. It says 100% extra battery to the phone. The phone has 2600mah.   But anyway, I prefer a portable battery. You get wayyyyyy more juice and don't have to use a case that makes your phone huge."
GalaxyS6,3dohya,OldSpaceChaos,2,Sun Jul 19 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"I got one roughly a week ago and here are my experiences with jt:  Pass through charging is not very good, at least on my unit. The first night I woke up to a dead phone but a fully charged case. The material is also a fingerprint and oil MAGENT. Everything and anything shows up on this. Charging is okay though, it easily charges my S6 back up to 100 percent.  If I were buying a battery case again, though, I'd probably give the  incipio off grid a look."

I have next to no problems with the S6. Touchwiz isn't great, but it's pretty good. The phone runs well for me, save for the quick closure of apps and battery life has been pretty good. I spend probably 60% of the day on wifi and can regularly pull off 4-5 hours SOT. Outside of that the camera is great and I love how it looks and feels."

I spent a lot of money to supposedly get the latest, greatest and fastest thing, and I am very disappointed. I would get rid of it except the camera is so so soooo good. Other than that, i prefer my old droid mini.   I sure wish they had made this thing a mm or 2 thicker and then they could have fit in a better battery. What's the point of making a phone so freaking thin when it's so tall and wide? It's big no matter what, so add a mm and give it decent battery life.

GalaxyS6,3dpfxp,JacksWastedTime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:49:18 2015 UTC,"I will try it. I guess I thought that ping ping root might be specific to certain roms, and cleanRom is not one of them.

GalaxyS6,3dpfxp,JacksWastedTime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:37:41 2015 UTC,No Odin is Samsung's bootloader for lack of a better term. If it's not Smart Manager it's something else. Honestly I know the answer you need is here in the sub I just can't think of the correct terms atm.

GalaxyS6,3domlc,suparnemo,3,Sat Jul 18 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue with my AT&T S6. Out of nowhere I had no service but it would show two bars. I couldn't make calls, couldn't text, couldn't use data. If I parked next to cell tower property and had the strongest LTE signal possible, it would seem to work normally. Once I left that close proximity and started to get a weaker signal, it would be like I had no sim card at all again. I did have my IMEI showing up correctly though.   I ended up trying factory resets and anything I could think of to pinpoint the problem, but it turns out it must have been a bad antenna in the phone that wouldn't hold weak signals.   I ended up going through warranty and received another phone that looks and feels brand new. There's really no way of telling whether or not you'll end up with a brand new or refurbished warranty replacement, but this thing was as good as when I took the brand new one out of the box for the first time.  EDIT: If you're technically inclined to trying a few more things before going through warranty, see if you can get the stock image of 5.0.2 (or whichever android version you have), and flash it with Odin. As long as it's the stock firmware from like sammobile, it should not trip Knox or cause any problems. I'd take a look over at xda-developers forums in the S6 category for information on restoring back to stock with Odin.  I remember seeing issues with ""lost"" IMEI when flashing custom ROMs on the Galaxy S3 a while back and restoring to stock using Odin seemed to fix that. It could be worth a shot. Good luck!"

GalaxyS6,3djqb4,oheligflopp,0,Thu Jul 16 22:42:58 2015 UTC,I can't wait for 2019 so we can use it in Canada! What bothers me most about this is 90% of retailers I visit already have an NFC pay terminal.
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,wraithverge,-12,Fri Jul 17 13:38:39 2015 UTC,I don't understand why we need another mobile payment platform.  What exactly is wrong with Google Pay/Wallet except that it's not Samsung?
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,ew73,14,Thu Jul 16 23:22:15 2015 UTC,Samsung Pay works everywhere. Google Wallet and Apple Pay do not. Samsung Pay can use NFC or magnetic stripe readers. That makes it instantly more usable than other mobile wallets.
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,ew73,-12,Thu Jul 16 23:28:54 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that the magnetic stripe technology isn't particularly new, and all it provides the POS terminal is a tokenized card number via a different route (MST vs. NFC or an actual honest-to-god swipe).    For reasons related to $job, I know far, far too much about what happens after the customer information leaves the POS terminal, and I can say with some (but not a lot) of authority that it's not really that much different.    MST truly is just a competitor to NFC -- it's a near-field method of sending Stuff.  MST happens to be in a crap top of terminals already, which is a great win, but, almost everyone  will be upgrading their POS terminals in the near future anyway to support chip-and-pin (or -and-sign, for now) transactions.  Every new POS terminal available supports NFC; merchants usually just turn it (and MST) off."
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,theonlydiego1,5,Thu Jul 16 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"MST isn't going anywhere any time soon here in the U.S., the payment processors have already admitted so and thus eased up on their recommendations except for ATMs. The great part is that Samsung Pay works everywhere right now (Mid August) and into the future and meets the EVM recommendations on liability. So good luck waiting for for merchants to buy NFC capable terminals (and activate them). A lot of merchants already have cheaper EVM capable terminals which DO NOT have NFC and are not going to waste money on buying NFC terminals. Those merchants will not accept Google Wallet or Apple Pay for the foreseeable future, but they will be instantly Samsung Pay compatible."
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,theonlydiego1,3,Fri Jul 17 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, even though some stores do have chip terminals they never work or the store doesn't want to use it."
GalaxyS6,3djqb4,theonlydiego1,2,Fri Jul 17 02:09:43 2015 UTC,"They won't use them until they absolutely have to and even then, some merchants will probably end up not using them at all. I can't tell you how many stores I've seen that have new (upgraded in the past 6 months) EVM terminals without NFC and still do not require chip card insertion. A few places instead ask for the last four digits of the card or the clerk asks to see the card and I imagine that will be the limit of their requirements of accepting credit cards. It's important to note that some of these merchants have to pay more to activate the EVM and NFC features on their terminals and choose to keep them deactivated to save money. I don't think some of these places will actually ever activate these features. Some seem content to look at the card and compare the signature and ask for an ID (if allowed by the card issuer like Discover and AMEX) than to actually activate these features on their terminals. To them that offers enough protection to justify the savings."

It started after an update to their app.  I took it to the dealership to find that there was a software update to the car's system that there was no possible way for me to know about without having brought it in.  They fixed it, I rebooted(the reboot was important), it worked fine.  I recommend calling your dealership and finding out when the latest update to your car's electronics was."

GalaxyS6,3dkf4q,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:00:36 2015 UTC,I had two faults with my s6. The screen was damaged and also the front facing camera had the infamous blue/purple dot issue.   I sent it off repair without having to pay anything - not even postage. I then received it back exactly a week later only to find my phone still had the front facing camera problem. Only this time the blue dots were in different places. This meant they did replace the camera sensor except with another faulty sensor. The screen was also replaced and is now working perfectly. So that's my experience with Samsung's repair centre. I could send the phone back again but going without a phone for a week is harder than it sounds.  I hope your issue gets solved this time.
GalaxyS6,3dkf4q,jaycent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:10:29 2015 UTC,"I LOLed harder than I should. @ Samsung Service Center - What do we have here? - An S6 with network issues. - Okay, classic. Get me a new camera lens cover immediately! Next time: - What do we have here? - An S6 with network issues. - This one has already been repaired, its probably a mistake, take it back! Third: - What do we have here? - An S6 with network issues. - Oh, come on, don't we have any other customers? We got that one 3 times now. Hey, Judy, give it a new screen and send it back. - Sure!"
GalaxyS6,3dkf4q,AppleiGeorge,-5,Fri Jul 17 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"I've got a signal issue. Basically the phones signal is poor, it drops 4g where other phones do not including the s3/s4/s5 and also htcs and Motorolas have no issue with the same network in the same location.   It also struggles in poor signal areas, it can lose signal entirely while I still have usable signal on another phone on  the same network.   So the first time I sent it for repair, it came back with a replaced screen and camera lens cover. I didn't ask for this, but that's what they did.   The second time they replaced the main board, it certainly improved things from how bad it was but still not as good as an old s3.  3rd time they did literally nothing and claimed it to be repaired. No notes of any maintenance performed, just a note saying it was repaired.  It wasn't repaired, it's exactly the same as before I sent it in. Also they sent it back to me without bubble wrap in a cardboard box just loose with some tape covering the phone!   What am I supposed to do in this situation?"
GalaxyS6,3dkf4q,themayker,8,Fri Jul 17 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"I sympathize with your situation, but the way you're bashing that rep... you'll never get what you want if you attack people.  Try being nice, even if you're frustrated. Just let them know nicely that it's now the 4th time, and you'd appreciate a solution to the problem. Advise them that their previous attempts have been unsuccessful and that you would like the matter escalated. Polite mate, it goes much farther than verbal abuse, to a person at a computer... who really doesn't care about your specific problem, and is probably 15 redbulls in with a leaning tower of pizza boxes accumulating."
GalaxyS6,3dkf4q,Whit3W0lf,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"I guess that's what happens after sending and receiving my phone in the mail 3 times over the period of a month. Who's gonna keep their cool after a month of that, I paid £550 in full for it, directly from Samsung, I've got no one else to deal with.   The moment he said that he could only reiterate what the customer service guys on the phone said is when I got frustrated.   I've been told I can escalate this issue once i received my phone back after the 2nd time, then they told me no it must be sent off again but if it comes back with the same issue we will look into offering you a replacement, but no they just told me it must be sent in again.   They lie to me and waste my time, claim my phone as repaired with no repair notes (even the Samsung guys said that was not right but don't actually do anything about it), ship my phone back loose in a cardboard box like its a toy and then ask me to send it in again.   And I'm being downvoted for not being the nicest to the support agent. Fanboys much?"

Your warranty will be void but you can reflash stock, which should be enough to return it. No guarantee though.   SMS backup is simple. Plenty of apps can do that, helium or titanium are easy.

I'm on Verizon which still hasn't provided the 5.1.1 update. I used this tool (http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s6/general/root-pingpongroot-s6-root-tool-t3103016) to root without flipping KNOX. Apparently doesn't work for 5.1.1 builds because 5.1.1 OTAs included an updated bootloader specifically to counter the root method. PSA: Don't typically accept PTAs.

GalaxyS6,3djvef,toonking23,3,Thu Jul 16 21:24:38 2015 UTC,My worst time was when I fully dimmed the screen accidentally in full sun light. I thought I bricked the phone.
GalaxyS6,3djvef,SteamTables,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:06:55 2015 UTC,That's weird.... I keep my screen at 100% too and it's bright as hell in low light... I only use AUTO when in direct sunlight for that extra boost.. I'm thinking your phone is stuck on AUTO even though it says it's off.
GalaxyS6,3djvef,Petnoone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"yeah, it seems like it.  It's driving me crazy though, might return the phone because of this.    Other reports suggest that this happens on almost every Edge device , but not on the normal S6.....  Tried a bunch of 3rd party brightness apps as well, nothing helps so far."

GalaxyS6,3dludw,devindudeman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:11:16 2015 UTC,Reminds me of those silent films from the 30s.  This one has just as much value. Plus it's one of the farthest things from a record that I've ever seen.

GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,mynameisntshawn,2,Thu Jul 16 10:45:11 2015 UTC,This is a headache man
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,DrNewyork,2,Thu Jul 16 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yup. Me too. There was a S6 Revisited review on /r/android yesterday and the reviewer said he experienced the exact same problems. This isn't a fringe issue, it affects a lot of people and it is complete bullshit."
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,BloodOnTheTracks,2,Thu Jul 16 13:04:29 2015 UTC,"While SLIGHTLY better, it gets worse over time.  I've had the update for a couple weeks and I can only barely swap between 2 apps before the background one dies."
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,eak125,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:03 2015 UTC,So far the thing is and this is even with some of the tweaks over from XDA is that everything starts fine. Eventually however there is a point where the amount of apps that stay open become less and less and then overall performance of the device starts to suffer. I'm running some new settings that were just posted from over there and want to see how they run after a few hours before saying anything.
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,SonofJersey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:30 2015 UTC,It's been a few hours...
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,eak125,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:50:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the wait. Things seem slightly improved, but not even close to how it was on my Nexus 5 I used to own."
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,SonofJersey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:58:04 2015 UTC,"Roger that.    There was another thread saying disable/uninstall samsung ""smart"" manager for better ram usage but I'm not certain whether you've done that already."
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,eak125,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:00:34 2015 UTC,I'll try that.
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,SonofJersey,2,Fri Jul 17 13:17:58 2015 UTC,I have all of those problems but I'm still running android 5.0.2
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,NarwallMan,2,Thu Jul 16 11:31:19 2015 UTC,I can only hope.  My phone runs like shit. My old Nexus 7 runs faster.  I'm starting to go nuts
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,irlcake,5,Thu Jul 16 11:59:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, it is incredibly frustrating some days. Ever since the update, my phone will lag up so much to the point it freezes and I have to force restart atleast every other day. Everything seems to be so much worse right now.  I love the phone a lot, but I didn't remember ever having to deal with lag like this on my s4."
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,lost_in_thesauce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:55:01 2015 UTC,I'm on 5.1.1 and phone is quick with no need to redraw the launcher. However the phone still can only hold about 4 apps in memory.
GalaxyS6,3dhpbt,nevalk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:27 2015 UTC,I held off getting 5.1.1 to wait for reports on RAM and performance issues as well as root access. What I heard so far is that the RAM management is as bad and battery has got worse for quite a few people. So I think I'll be staying on 5.0.2 with root and the RAM tweaks on XDA.
