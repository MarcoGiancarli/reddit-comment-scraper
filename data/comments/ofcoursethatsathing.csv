Then she felt the Hitachi against her inner leg and worried she might come too soon!   And that's the second part: they are try to focus on something other than their orgasm. When you're touching yourself you know what's going to happen and you're going along. But here, it's out if their control, the orgasm is happening without their input and while trying to focus on something entirely different.

Four and twenty blackbirds,  Baked in a pie.  When the pie was opened,  The birds began to sing;  Wasn't that a dainty dish,  To set before the king?  The king was in his counting house,  Counting out his money;  The queen was in the parlour,  Eating bread and honey.  The maid was in the garden,  Hanging out the clothes,  When down came a blackbird  And pecked off her nose."

They're amazing.   But as an American whose favor can be easily swayed, really? Yours are better? I need to start saving money. Because if yours are better, hit dsmn. I'll be in heaven.

It does depend a bit on where you go, not every place follows the rules, but when you get a pie with big chunks of tender steak with just the right amount of gravy, it's just glorious."
