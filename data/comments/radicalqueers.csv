radicalqueers,3dmbv2,aredridel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with these points for the most part. I think the innate argument was originally strategic and may not be as relevant amore (at least in #Murika). You can't discriminate against someone born a woman, born black, or born queer, but you can discriminate against people's choices and behaviors. I can choose to not hire someone because they made a mysoginst  comment in an interview (non-innate behavior), but I can't discriminate because of someone's genetics. Being able to discriminate between people's behaviors is needed for a free society. As equal rights were the goal, the lbgtqia movement followed the strategy outlined by the civil rights movement and woman's suffrage movement. The HAES movement (fat acceptance) is trying to use the same strategy (it's muh genetics).  Ask anyone who studies behavior if it's nature or nurture, and the answer is aways both. The innate argument was just political."
radicalqueers,3djuri,chismaquina,0,Thu Jul 16 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"It's just so much speculation. If we consider the Internet as a great example of a modern technology that developed quickly and revolutionized life, we should at least check out how fast it developed. In the 1960s, it was theoretical. In the '70s, actual. In the '80s, formalizing. In the '90s, commercializing. Cranial implants solving psychology in 20 years when that isn't even in the pipeline yet? I doubt it. Similarly, if human lifespan gets counted in centuries, our generation will be dead already.  Besides that, there are the objections to transhumanism that you're mentioning -- that it will lead to eugenics, the rich reaping the benefits, be bad for humanity, and so on. That problem lies within our current economic situation rather than the speculative future technology.  So in this hypothetical future world, marriage is radically transformed into the thing it already seems to be headed towards. I'd consider it more likely that marriage is radically transformed in the near future while we still live ~80 years than it be transformed as a result of us living ~500 years.  Bonus: a commenter named ""advancedatheist"" breaking new ground  in the field of transhumanmisogyny."

Show me the big gay resistance to the prison-industrial complex (which targets and victimizes people of color—particular black and latin@ people) and its abuse of queer inmates. Organizations exist (like Black and Pink), and that's great, but they're not big. They're not getting support from the greater gay rights movement.  I as a queer/bi poly trans woman don't have any right to equal employment in the majority of the united states. In 42 states, dating men makes my life fucking forfeit. But hey, white homosexuals can get married. Hooray. The HRC et al have been telling us to shut up and get in line for decades, assuring us that our rights are coming but first the affluent white gays get what they want.

Oh, Christ. I'm talking to a white reddit brogressive. No wonder you're so obtuse about this. If you're going to be in the radical queers subreddit, dude, you should probably at least be somewhat familiar with radical politics. Hint: ""socially liberal"" is not considered in itself a good thing here, as most who use it are fucking conservatives.   The Gay Rights movement would hurt itself by taking on a general liberal tone. THis is called ""politics"". Its part of the trouble Feminism is running into. By stretching itself too thinly, Feminism becomes a buzzword that means nothing.   Let's not get into a tangent on feminism; you don't seem particularly familiar with it, and I'm not here to give lessons. But if you had an ounce of radical politics in you, you'd be pretty skeptical about playing ""politics"" as it is defined by those in power.   So honey, get in line.

Don't you dare forget how long and hard the struggle for mere marriage was. What are you, 14? 15? You sound like you've never even heard of anything having to do with the AIDS struggle, the bloody murders, and familial abuse. Don't trivialize this win, it has been more than 50 years coming.   I'm 27, and I know from your post history that you're an English major. Nice try, though. Fucking hilarious that a cis person wants to talk to me about bloody murders and gay sacrifice for trans folk. Your community still barely accepts me, despite that it was trans women throwing the first bricks and bottles at Stonewall. Trans women actively pushing in the struggle for rights. Trans people who got cut out of the deal at the last minute. If you want to talk to me about history, you should learn the fucking history. It involves white cis gay men using the rest of the community to serve their own fucking interests, while the rest of us are bargaining chips to be haggled away.   I'd also like to add that THank God most trans folk I know don't share your opinion, or you'd have shot my interest in helping on this issue.   I'm sure that you're a very valuable ally.

We get pushed out of legal reforms on a regular basis, have been since the start. We help out, the big gay movement makes grand claims about LGBT equality, and in the end we get LGB equality (for homonormative whites) at best.  Also, which group are you even talking about? You still haven't provided examples for how the gay community has served the needs of the non-white, non-cis queer community; all you've done is provide excuses.   I don't need your approval to be a valuable ally.   Justify that statement. What value have you brought? From what you've been telling me, you don't give a single fuck.

Do you know what would happen if we actually tried to push for both sides at once? We'd be labled hedonistic extremists and laughed out of the public square. Nothing gets acomplished that way. So we took an alternate route. The group that was the least shocking to society trailblazed for the rest of the gender and sexual minorities that would come after.   Ooo, fun. Respectability politics. Not like that hasn't been grilled to death already.   You wouldn't get shit acomplished without our efforts first, just as neither of us would have gotten anywhere without the legal emancipation of women.   But hey, yeah, let's pretend it was respectable white cis gays who led the charge in gay rights, and not rioting brown queers.   And if straight men as a group were experiencing horrible oppression on par with what gay men were suffering, you can bet your ass that they'd be in line first.   What exactly do you think is happening to queer immigrants when they are rounded up into detention centers? What do you think happens to trans women who are sent to male prisons? What sort of oppression do you think the other queers who took part in your liberation have been putting up with this entire time? Read something for fuck's sake. Read a lot of things.   And as a gay man, I'd support the straight men with the hopes that after they won, it would lay the ground work for other sexual groups. It's called ""pragmatism"".   Ah, yes.

They should stop misrepresenting violence against trans women of color as if it were happening to the entire LGBT umbrella. They should stop saying ""support us, we'll get to you next"" when what they mean is ""we'll get to you never, but support us anyways.""  Trans folk know how to organize for themselves.

Or are these people who have sex with multiple genders? Is that within a certain timeframe? I clicked on the article and a link about the study, but I couldn't find the actual study. I think that would make a huge difference depending on how they defined bisexual.  Because I think a lot of people would identify as gay or straight who have sex with more than just their gender, or who may even be attracted physically or romantically to more than one gender.   Either way, I'm sure there's a lot to speculate about as to why bisexuals, however that's defined, are poorer and less healthy than monosexuals. I think there would be more differing reasons as to why bisexual men and women are poorer and less healthy than overlapping reasons, although I'm sure there is both.   I don't want to speculate too much. I see no other comments here either, because let's face it, I'm sure it could get offensive really quickly. Bisexual social stigma does seem like a factor, and the least taboo factor to talk about. But I think there is more to it."

However, where does femininity and masculinity fit into this conversation? I can't shake the feeling that there is some sort of innate ""essential"" connection to this spectrum. I agree that gendered identifiers are separate from this and wholly manufactured by socialization; but I think that connection to being ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" or varying shades of both is something that exists beyond socialization.  Just rambling: I identify as ""a guy"" versus ""a man"" because the implicit masculine connotation associated with ""Manliness"". I do this because I feel like ""Guy"" is a psuedo-gendered identifier that places me within masculinity but not explicitly as masculine. So my comment I guess, is that I feel that regardless of the social identifiers of what it is to be a ""Man"" and ""Manliness"" I'd still fall within some shade of masculinity devoid of gendered signifiers."

I already don't think that masculinity is a concrete/coherent concept that can be signified. It's a macro-indetifier that alludes to a shifting set of characteristics; I think that femininity/masculinity is a lot more complex than an 'either/or' situation but a really fuzzy gradient spectrum that isn't static.  For example, today I woke up feeling like I don't want to take up space, like I don't want to be spacially imposing. I feel like I want to look more soft and delicate than not. I think these feelings (which are distinctly feminine) would be there no matter what, but the projected performance of these feelings is what is subject to change due to socialization. So today I wear jeggings and some glitter to achieve my desired feeling, but in Ancient Rome I would express them in wholly different ways-- the feelings are an underlying force and the produced performance is the part that is socially constructed.   So glitter and jeggings make me feel less imposing and prettier because society labels those things as such, but regardless of performing it this way I'd still have those underlying urges that make me want to act out in a less imposing and more delicate way separate from my historical context and the identifiers I choose to represent this."

I feel that regardless of the social identifiers of what it is to be a ""Man"" and ""Manliness"" I'd still fall within some shade of masculinity devoid of gendered signifiers.   What is the justification for such certainty? I'd have a different relation to contemporary notions of femininity/masculinity if I were at a different place with regard to transitioning; I can barely speculate on if ""I"" (if such a person could even be spoken of as the same one as me) had been given a different ASAB.

It most certainly does exist, as a social construction. The point of social construct theory is to challenge assumptions that gender is a fixed, innate quality beyond history and analysis.  I think this interview is probably relevant to your line of questioning. Here's a choice quote (emphasis is mine):   If she [Shelia Jeffreys] makes use of social construction as a theory to support her view, she very badly  misunderstands its terms.  In her view, a trans person is “constructed” by a medical discourse and therefore is the victim of a social construct.  But this idea of social constructs does not acknowledge that all of us, as bodies, are in the active position of figuring out how to live with and against the constructions  – or norms – that help to form us.  We form ourselves within the vocabularies that we did not choose, and sometimes we have to reject those vocabularies, or actively develop new ones.  For instance, gender assignment is a “construction” and yet many genderqueer and trans people refuse those assignments in part or in full.  That refusal opens the way for a more radical form of self-determination, one that happens in solidarity with others who are undergoing a similar struggle.  One problem with that view of social construction is that it suggests that what trans people feel about what their gender is, and should be, is itself “constructed” and, therefore, not real.  And then the feminist police comes along to expose the construction and dispute a trans person’s sense of their lived reality.  I oppose this use of social construction absolutely, and consider it to be a false, misleading, and oppressive use of the theory."

Now, if you look marriage in an extended historical context it is very obvious that it was an institution that was designed to wholly commodify women within dowry's that consisted of trading young women, livestock, and land. Further if you look to the precedent set by Colonial America you see very similar things. In the United States marriage laws didn't occur out of recognizing a natural union, but a very intentional way to define the parameters of what the proper ""Puritan, and Colonial"" family should look like -- We continue to use the same model today.  2.) Marriage, in the traditional sense, is hinged off two people pairing off as the means of the ideal relationship that will produce offspring. This pairing entrenches the male/female binary mythos as both being ideal, and most legitimate.  3.) We can see that other SCOTUS rulings, namely in the strike down of the Defense Of Marriage Act (DOMA), that it's about financial privilege and not providing social equality. Windsor's partner died, dissolving her estate finances, ultimately forcing Windsor to pay about 350,000 in Estate taxes. These ladies were white, socially elite, multi-millionaires. This ruling protected and calcified her wealth -- if it was a not-white person that was put out on the street instead of being displaced from their mansion when their partner died we wouldn't have ever heard about it. SCOTUS wouldn't have cared about the injustice, it's clearly about preserving financial power among those who already have it.  Overall, marriage is an institution that gives the government an easy ""Privilege granting mechanism"" to promote specific lifestyles and family structures. When it comes down to it, all marriage is (in a legal sense), is a lifelong contract that you have to co-sign; and this is problematic because when there is a contract that you have to sign there will always be those who don't meet the terms of the contract -- especially when these terms are defined by socially regulatory laws."

This article does a pretty decent job at breaking down how capitalism has created strict identities for Queer folk. I think the best known example would be Modern Family -- They are two white males, who are educated, upper/middle-class, and have adopted the Nuclear Family as the most acceptable family construct (one that is distinctly heterosexual. A mom, dad, and their off-spring) Further, you have shows like Wil and Grace, and the Fab 5 furthering this stereotype of what it means to be ""Gay"". The problem with this is that it is creating a strict identity of socially accepted gay folk.. and the others.    The people who don't fit into this category are folks who practice Polyamory, don't wish to support Statist institutions such as marriage, and generally anyone that is under-privileged and lower class, trans folks, Persons of Color, folks with disabilities, etc..   There a lot more arguments about how Capitalism has specifically shaped and wrought destruction on Queers who don't fit into a strict paradigm of ""The right kind of Homosexual"" (like those who want to be married with kids). This is probably the most prominent and easily explained.   I argue that corporations don't care about Queer people, or people at all. Rather, they ""support"" rights because it is the sexy and popular thing for them to do and that allows them to increase their bottom line. This is where ""Co-option"" comes in - They are twisting ""equality"" into a persuasive force that makes people want to buy more of their stuff instead of their competitors. I think the effects of this are fairly apparent if you look at examples like Chick-Fil-A -- their bottom line started dropping when they didn't support gay rights. The CEO is still a bigot and doesn't care about queer people, he just retracted his statements so that he could make more money.  Touching on my aggressive comment, I believe that corporations are inherently problematic for working class wage-laborers and the environment. Allowing these voices to influence ""equal rights"" only covers up the really bad things they do because they can release a lot of press about how much they love gay people. It desensitizes us to the atrocities committed by their infrastructure (such as deforestation, animal exploitation, worker exploitation, etc..) and soothes our guilt because they donated some money to the cause for marriage.   I'd love to engage in dialogue if you have any questions, thoughts, comments, concerns, etc.. I promise I won't get mean like my first comment. :)"

Government will simply reemerge in a simpler form, destined to grow back into what it had originally been.   Similarly, no matter how I imagine the world, there is always capitalism. There will always be people trading goods and services in exchange for something of benefit.

radicalqueers,37nuna,scottastic,1 point,Fri May 29 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"No matter how I picture the world, there will always be some sort of ""government"".    And I agree with you. For me Anarchism is both an ideal and a pragmatic philosophy - It's a near-Utopian thought experiment that seeks to show the underlying oppressiveness of government, statist institutions, or more generally speaking - Social hierarchies. I don't think Anarchism has an 'Endgame' scenario, because like you said, there will always be those who try to extend their power beyond themselves and on to others. So, once again - to me -  Anarchism is a process and a lifestyle that seeks to undo as much of this exploitation and oppression as possible. I don't think that just because hierarchical institutions/people will continue to exist doesn't mean that I shouldn't do whatever I can to minimize the harm that it causes to people -- I'm certainly an idealist, but I don't think I'm totally naive in this regard. It's important to note that I'm not looking to simply minimize harm, but rather interrogate and root out it's source - and that's what Anarchism does.   how I imagine the world, there is always capitalism    I mostly agree with you here too. There will always be greedy people who seek to hoard resources and exploit others to maintain their ""wealth"" (whatever that really means). Much like train of thought above it's a process to undo this - not an endgame where we can finally say ""Well, glad that nasty Capitalism business is over!"" this is a pun ... business ha . I think that what makes the current form of Capitalism so insidious is that it self-perpetuates itself through constant need to progress and move forward. Because of this progression it has turned both people and Earth as simply a means to perpetuate this on-going progression. Capitalism isn't an economic system to benefit people but rather has developed into a growing ""organism"" in its own right - it demands to constantly be fed regardless if there are needs to be met or not; hence the immense diversity and quantity of commodities produced.    I'll answer your last paragraph in a different comment to break up the wall of text."
radicalqueers,37nuna,scottastic,1 point,Sat May 30 00:53:01 2015 UTC,"I don't want to characterize what I believe as ""natural"" because I don't really know where the threshold for ""natural"" is. But rather I'm against both institutionalized hierarchies (like government and such) and Capitalism because it views people as a means to an end. These institutions themselves are for people to serve, not for them to serve people, and that's my issue with it.    What would be a better system?   I don't think there is a single better system. Wanting a single, monolithic solution is part of the problem. For instance I think that industrialized civilization perpetuates a whole lot of problems that Anarchism tries to fix, so I'm in the process of structuring my life in such a way that I don't have to be industrial   (more specifically, I'm moving to a small/sustainable/organic farm in a small intentional community where I can live in a small dwelling made out of natural local materials where I will be enabled to produce the majority of my own food so that I may have a smaller impact on the ecology around me. Note the theme of ""small"" and minimizing in every way possible- this is very important to me.) I'm an Anti-Civilization/Post-Civilization Anarchist.   However there are Anarchists that believe that automation, urban culture, and transhumanism has part in an Anarchist society -- who am I to disagree with that? I don't know how it'd work - I haven't thought through it - but as long as it's truly anarchist and ecologically sustainable then it's great. I don't see why my more primitive lifestyle has to be in direct conflict with an urbanized lifestyle; diversity is always beautiful.   There needs to be intensive and extreme decentralization. That's my only ""solution"". Extreme decentralization and localization. Remove the need for people to depend on others (from, say half way around the globe) so that we can be connected by purely social ties that don't depend on an economic necessity (therefore opening the door to exploitation). If an effect of this is that we lose ties with people on other continents or even on the same continent, then so be it - I don't think it would, but I think it's a better alternative to extreme globalization and interconnenctedness."

Yet they remain largely invisible in the case law and in the popular understanding of discrimination. Why is this? While more than one academic in the field suggested—in informal discussion about this project—that lack of discrimination was the reason for bisexuals’ invisibility in the case law, this supposition is inconsistent with the emerging social science data on the experiences of bisexuals. It also conflicts with the results of our study, which is the first published quantitative study to focus comprehensively on bisexuals’ experiences with employment discrimination. Our study demonstrates that bisexuals face considerable discrimination in the workplace"" (699-700)."

As far as ""what it [means] to be a radical queer"", as i see it there are basically two ways to look at that phrase:   a queer who is radical- a queer who has radical politics (in general). Such politics probably meaning far-left here, so some sort of anarchist or marxist. Queer being a term where most usage today is tied to its meaning as a slur, whether reclaimed or otherwise. A definition one might offer to include those reclaiming it could be ""those targeted by homophobia and/or transphobia"". So a radical queer could be anyone who reclaims the latter term and has anarchist or marxist politics or it might be applied to someone who takes a radical approach to political issues relevant to 'the queer subject'. what does this mean? a principle of radical queer politics is refusing the isolation of LGBTetc issues- slogans like 'poverty is a queer issue' because it's something we're more likely to have to deal w due to our oppression, 'racism is a queer issue' because it influences which of us face the brunt of our oppression; rejecting the full integration of LGBT persons into imperialist militaries or the capitalist economy as a liberatory goal (even doubting the possibility of the latter); rejecting narratives that use the presence of (hard-won) legal rights to justify racism, war, and occupation; rejecting liberal understandings of oppression, and looking at how homophobia and transphobia are tied into other kinds of oppression...ultimately, i think it would be fair to say that it's about not being content with inclusion in a fundamentally unjust order (a false promise to begin with for many), and seeking to practice solidarity with others for whom present conditions are intolerable.

While such assumptions do exist in some cases, and it is true that it is often better (with regards to how others treat you) to be perceived as heterosexual, there are 3 problems with this concept. The first is, of course, that this perception does not always exist: that if one is known to be bisexual, then even in a man-woman relationship, they are not immune from homophobia and biphobia being directed at them (which can lead to bi women facing additional violence compared to heterosexual women, as noted in the article). And even if they have not disclosed (or been outed), they still see all the attacks on their same-gender desire that heterosexual people never do. The last reason, to go back to what I started off with: society isn't fundamrntally organized regarding these things on the basis of sexual orientation (a fairly recent concept)- certain relationships are viewed as superior not because they signal heterosexuality...this gets it backwards: the demand for heterosexuality is about getting people into such relationships.  The second paragraph neglects the pressure of heterosexist society. Bi people are pressured into man-woman relationships- and, yes, so are LG people (although, for the latter, such relationships are necessarily lacking, which isn't the case for bi people such as myself)! Ignoring this doesn't help any LGB people. It's also strange to see an article posted to radicalqueers acting as if subjectivity is formed in a vacuum isolated from society. We are then told that privilege is about saying mean things- not, I don't know, structural relationships between exploited and oppressed (mean words are involved, certainly, but without society being organized so that A's words have a deletorious impact on people in B group, but not the other way around...then privilege doesn't have anything to do with it, even if it's not nice).  Again, it doesn't help bisexuals to pretend that we aren't pressured to 'make the right choice' with the promise of better treatment (that is, of escaping the threat of being treated as those in same-gender relationships are).  ""Monosexual"" (especially with ""privilege"" attached, but even without) is a word that is useless to fighting heterosexism, because it doesn't correspond to how society is organized (whether one is looking at the oppression of bisexual people or that of lesbian and gay people)."

We can clearly identify struggles that people identifying as bisexuals face, and the article does a good job of that, but this doesn't negate potential gains/privilege from presenting as straight.  Privilege isn't something you either have or don't in a singular moment depending on how you identify or what sort of label you put on your sexual/intimate relationships. Privilege is a concept we use to describe the aggregation of benefits gained, actions taken, thoughts had, et cetera in relation to a particular social structure/identity.  A bisexual who is presently in a hetero relationship may well experience negative effects because of their sexual identity. That doesn't mean that the person hasn't or doesn't gain from hetero-normative structures. A person can both gain relative to others and lose relative to others due to hetero-normativity. For example: a bisexual identifying person in a heterosexual relationship is much less likely to be randomly assaulted for their sexuality when walking down the street with their partner when compared to a bisexual in a homosexual relationship.  The article links to another article by the same author that is talking about another study:   what we have here is a situation in which people who not straight, and who are in relationships with men, are being abused by those men. The study, then, is not so much about the experiences of bisexual women or gay men but about those of queer people who date men.   So we can also say the problem is queer people dating men or the clash between a toxic hetero-normative masculinity and a queer sexuality; I think attributing this difference to bisexuality, though it is not technically wrong, misses what the problem is. Identifying as a bisexual does not automatically rid a person of internalized hetero-normativity or remove all gains from hetero-normativity. The article does make a good point that I think explains more what is going on here:   the fact is that many socially conscious people, including many members of the LGBT community, are actually more likely to do things like examine privilege, disavow it, work to dismantle it or resist it.   Maybe a person who is more likely to identify as bisexual (not have ""bisexual urges"" or whatever) is also more likely to have a more critical view of hetero-normative behaviors because of their placement in a specific community or some cultural phenomenon. I don't think the identity isn't necessarily key, it is another symptom of a healthier discourse on sexuality.  But the author furthers their critique with:   It implies that same-sex love is influenced and regulated -- in some hearts -- by social norms.   The author then goes on to argue that the statement above is queerphobic. If we stopped there it would be but I think that is just how all love works. I don't think it is wise to ignore how social norms build the world around us or how those norms impact our behavior and decisions; if hetero-normativity didn't restrict or impact our intimate decisions, our lives, in a way we see as negative it wouldn't be hetero-normativity anymore. Everyone might have sexual attractions to certain types of people built into them, I don't know, but regardless of this fact our behaviors, our sexualities, all of our identities and our experiences of them are mediated through our horrible social structures. It might not control them entirely but it is always an influence, our sexuality doesn't exist in a vacuum regardless of whether or not the sexual preferences are innate.  Clearly the statement that the article is arguing against is ridiculous but we don't need to fetishize bisexual identity in order to rebuke it and I don't think doing so helps any of us. Bisexuality is another way of describing sexual preference, a person with that preference and/or that identity may experience negative effects at the hands of hetero-normative actions/structures but it doesn't mean they are immune from hetero-normative gains."
radicalqueers,331mvq,Samuel_Bellamy,0,Sat Apr 18 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've read through this again (I couldn't sleep), and it seems you aren't aware or don't agree with the concept of monosexual privilege. Here is the monosexual privilege checklist, written by the great radical Israeli activist, Shiri Eisner.   If we look at the basic data on bisexual oppression, all the reliable data we have seems to show that bisexuals suffering from a unique systemic monosexist structure as well as the heteronormative one. You can find evidence in the San Francisco government's Bisexual Invisibility report and the CDC's NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation.   For theory on why this happens, there is a paper published in the Stanford Law Review called The epistemic contract of bisexual erasure., which shows why lesbians, gay men, and straights all have incentives to oppress bisexuals.   But, really, the best thing is just to read Shiri Eisner's Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution. It's written from a radical perspective and is very thorough and compelling."
radicalqueers,331mvq,Samuel_Bellamy,5,Sun Apr 19 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"I am aware of that concept and it doesn't have to clash with what I was saying. I recognize the real effects bisexuality has on people's lives, but this doesn't mean that they can't simultaneously enjoy some of what we call hetero-sexual privilege.  That is why I was trying to present a slightly different view of what privilege is, not deny your claims that it exists. Privilege is a name we give to social phenomenon, just because we think of bisexuality and other sexualities as distinct, separate, conflicting, mutually-exclusive, et cetera, that does not mean that our social institutions that produce privilege in the real-world function that way. A bisexual person may face abuse because of that identity, they may simultaneously receive some other (good) treatment because they are in a relationship that appears as straight to some people and causes others to treat them as they would a straight person. In this case the person is gaining from hetero privilege whether or not they are hetero and simultaneously experiencing a lack of ""mono-sexual"" privilege in another aspect of their life.  I don't think privilege or oppression should be thought of as forces acting universally or equally upon all people of a specific identity; I think this view of privilege depends on an assumption of unifying factors in bisexual (or whatever identity) experience which I think is always a problematic assumption. We can't make any certain statement about ""bisexual experience"" and doing so is reductive of bisexuals differences. Privilege exists in events and in real gains people get, and those interactions, those gains depend on much more than how a person identifies their sexuality or type of relationship."
radicalqueers,331mvq,Samuel_Bellamy,0,Sun Apr 19 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to borrow from Shiri Eisner here:  Eisner talks about how in many/most/all (depending on how your counting) it seems much more correct to say that heterosexuals benefit from heterosexual and monosexual privilege, homosexuals benefit from monosexual privilege, and bisexuals benefit from no privilege.   However, bisexuals can sometimes pass as straight or lesbian/gay. And then she talks about how passing is not really privilege. If you are intentionally passing, then you might always be fearful that someday, sometime, without warning or consent, your cover will be blown. In fact, I've read several stories about people who held their partner's bisexuality over their head-threatening that they would out them to their friends, family, and co-workers in order to preserve the abusive nature of a relationship. And bisexuals do suffer from greater rates of intimate partner violence than other orientations.  Then of course, there is coercive passing, which happens constantly to us. Unless we are literally holding a sign that says ""I am bisexual,"" no one will see us that way unless we tell them. And often that is not enough because they will just find some reason to say, ""no you're not."" I've personally had that happen to me a lot of times--friends, family, strangers. I've been out less than a year. On top of that, I am only out to my English-speaking friends. (I live in a second-tier city in China, and I speak a very poor Chinese most of the time).  Eisner goes on to talk about how passing first came about as a term--for enslaved Black Americans who could ""pass"" for white, which often allowed them to try to escape to Canada in ways not available to other Blacks. But this was hardly a ""privilege"" because they were still a slave and still an inch away from slavery once more.  She goes on:   [I]n her article ""Passing for White, Passing for Black,"" American light-skinned mixed-race artist Adrian Piper writes:  For most of my life I did not understand that I needed to identify my racial identity publicly and that if I did not, I would be inevitably mistake for white. I simply didn't think about it. But since I also made no special effort to hide my racial identity, I often experienced the shocked and/or hostile reactions of whites who discovered it after the fact. I always knew when it had happened, even when the person declined to confront me directly: the startled look, the searching stare that would fix itself on my facial features, one by one, looking for the telltale ""negroid"" feature, the sudden, sometimes permanent withdrawal of good feeling or regular contact--all alerted me to what had transpired. Uh-oh, I would think to myself helplessly, and watch another blossoming friendship wilt.  In another instance, she writes:  I have sometimes met blacks socially who, as a condition of social acceptance of me, require me to prove my blackness by passing the Suffering Test: They recount at length their recent experiences of racism and then wait expectantly, skeptically, for me to match theirs with mine [...] I would share some equally nightmarish experience along similar lines, and would then have it explained to me why that wasn't really so bad, why it wasn't the same thing at all, or why I was stupid for allowing it to happen to me.   Eisner continues:   This double-edged effect of passing might shed light on many bisexuals' experience, as we often have to deal with other people's doubts and scrutiny about our lives, our choices, and our identification. To pass by default means constantly being presumed and treated as something other than what you are, to always be accepted on the premises that you are not bisexual. It means fearing the moment of disclosure, and seeing the spark die in another person's eye as the word ""bisexual"" hits the surface, to always know to expect rejection. It means being scrutinized and asked to ""prove"" ourselves: Often we are presented with the demand to provide lists of lovers and sexual affairs in order to prove our bisexual status. In lesbian/gay settings, we are constantly asked to prove the oppression that we suffer, presuming that, because they can't see it, then it doesn't exist at all.   Somewhere else she also mentions how perspective romantic partners often feel ""betrayed"" when we tell them we are bisexual--it doesn't matter if it is the first date or the 100th, saying we are bisexual usually instantly turns the conversation to something between cautiously hostile to outright hostile, often causing an end of the relationship or prospective relationships. This echos the ""wilting friendship"" of the above passage.  So, rather than say ""it's sort of privilege at some times in some ways"" why don't we call it what it is? Passing. Passing it not a privilege. It can result in certain privileges that real privileges confer, but they are dependent on keeping up the charade--they are in danger of being taken away at any time. Privilege is generally a state of relative comfort relative to another group--comfort that your privilege will be there, so comfortable that you probably don't know it's there. But passing is very, very different.  As well, coercive passing is never a good thing because the bisexual doesn't choose it. And it has real consequences--wilting friendships and relationships in its wake.   So yeah. I agree with Eisner:   These problems demonstrate the limitations of the ""heterosexual privilege"" discourse. Looking into things from the ""privilege"" perspective might lend weight to distortion of power relations around bisexuality, and serve as vehicle for monosexist views. Seeing as such, I would like to propose a change in terms around this issue: from privilege into passing. Such a change, I hope, would enrich our understandings of power, hierarchies, and oppression around bisexuality and in bisexual people's lives, allowing us to view the complexities of this issue, as well as its subversive potential."

Obviously it's in the interests of the bourgeoisie to be able to sell to, and extract labor from, as wide a group of people as possible, but it's not like they could just chuck the prevailing social mores out the window centuries ago*, so it was, and continues to be, a slow process.  So unless you're interested in increasing the market reach of the bourgeoisie - and you're obviously not - they're not your bedfellows just because they deign to extend to you the same bourgeois rights that non-queers have by default.  That isn't to say that these freedoms are nothing. We have to eat, and to eat we, unfortunately for as long as the status quo persists, must interact with the market (or turn to crime). So if agitating for your bourgeois rights means the difference between starving and not starving, obviously you should agitate for your bourgeois rights, so long as you recognize that it's not a goal in itself and that it doesn't make the bourgeoisie your allies (which you obviously do); it simply means you've managed to convince the bourgeoisie to throw you a few more scraps from their table, which is all we're going to get until the revolution.  * Nor were they necessarily inclined to, since the bourgeoisie are still human and thus just as likely as anyone else to internalize those social mores.

It might just be me but I was a little put-off by a sentiment that I feel like I have been seeing everywhere lately.  This article really shows us how contemporary discourse on bisexuality is following in the footsteps of a post-stonewall gay discourse in the 70's. I am not trying to condemn the article or the people writing it and I want that to be clear, but I do think there is a valid critique to be had. This article illustrates a concerted effort to portray bisexuality as a coherent and static identity category, another sexuality. At this point I feel I have to say that I find bisexuality is no more or less an innate quality than any other sexual identity; but I'm not sure that trying to liberate bisexuals or bisexuality is all it is claimed to be.  Amongst this movement there is certainly good that is done, but why do we allow our politics to be restricted by heterosexist legitimizing? What I mean is that a politics that is to provide room for the individual to realize their desires rather than trying to legitimize bisexuality, a discourse which renders our politics in a de facto state of condemning any sexual way of being that cannot be identified as gay, straight, or now maybe bisexual.  Once again I am not saying this is stopping good from being done within the push for recognition of bisexuality, I am not trying to invalidate that, but this problem pervades.  We need to stop playing into a politics that begins with the assumption that a person needs to legitimize their sexual activities as ""natural"" or ""innate"" or as ""just like straight people"" in order to be treated as having valid will. We need to stop saying ""we deserve to be treated like people because our identity is as valid as yours"" and just stop after the first 6 words. We deserve to be treated like people regardless of whether or not we can garner enough political support for our preferred identity category and, consequently, legitimize our being.  We are playing in a sexual politics that robs everyone of the claim to a legitimacy of their desires, unless the person can keep their sexuality within the confines of a restrictive, normative sexual category.   Some might not have desires that can be adequately described as hetero, homo or bisexual, I don't feel we should have to keep our actions within the accepted limits of any of these identities in order to be considered valid.  I'm not claiming the article or their discourse is to blame for this erasure, that would be silly; I just thought this might be a good place to talk about why we require identity for validity. This default disrespect for a person is a political trick as a result of institutionalized heterosexist sexuality and it is really a load of crap.  In this situation we aren't trying to get marriage, we aren't really trying to get legal rights; maybe empowering an identity category is the wrong way to go. We need to look at a problem that is often obscured by identity politics; the bad treatment of specific identity groups is clearly a significant problem, but it is not the only problem. It is not a problem that can be entirely fixed through these sort of identity-based liberation methods.   Our problem is our society is founded upon sick ideas of what it means to be a person, about who deserves to be treated well, that you must act in a prescribed manner in order to gain the status of a real person, et cetera. Within this politics you must have a sexuality that is socially accepted as valid otherwise you can be treated as less than human. We will never fix our problems if all we do is create a more complex schema of categorization."

There is no reason to treat me poorly because you think my identity is invalid (gee that sounds familiar).  It isn't about my warm fuzzy feeling and I made that clear; it is about not playing into a politics that creates qualifiers for people to be considered valid people.  This is a politics that has real negative effects on people's lives and contributes to the perpetuation of various forms of domination of non-normative sexuality. I am unaware of the legal rights that bisexuals are deprived of that isn't covered by extending marriage to gay couples or that would be best alleviated by consolidation of bisexual identity.  I am not invalidating the search for rights or saying people shouldn't have them, that is a strawman you've built. My point is that we shouldn't need to solidify this identity that can cause problems in order to assert validity of our persons. To me that is exactly what separates a radical queer politics from a mainstream lgbt politics.  Your condescending tone belies the exact sort of problem people who don't fit into the sexualities legitimized by heterosexist society face as a result of this essentialist 3-part schema of sexuality. You don't know me or my problems and you assume my objections are invalid compared to a ""valid"" pursuit of legal rights, and you make this assumption because I am claiming to not fit your categories. Do you honestly not see how this causes a problem for people who are still considered ""abnormal"" after bisexuality is legitimized? People whose troubles are not accepted within dominant bisexual discourse get their troubles ridiculed as you have done above. Do you not see how actions like that aggregate to invalidate people who are left behind by a politics of empowering bisexuality?  I'm not saying bisexuals shouldn't push to be respected or have the same rights as anyone. It is similar to historic treatment of trans-folk by mainstream lgbt. I'm not saying it does no good; I am saying that we need to examine our politics because the assumption that people's statements about themselves are invalid or unimportant in the face of new ""queer"" legitimizing structure is fucked. If we aren't critical of this then we end up calling into question the validity of other queer people in order to legitimize ourselves.  You literally just did this. (not assuming your sexuality just saying that your comment illustrates this discourse)  My critique is not invalidating the personal value of legal rights. Legal rights or their absence doesn't invalidate a negative practice and fixing problems with sexual politics broadly is not mutually exclusive with self-criticism."

I never said rights weren't very important, only that they are not the whole issue. If we are not ignoring bisexual politics because legal rights for gay people are ""more important"" then why are we ignoring non-binary sexuality because bisexual politics is ""more important?""  I may dress my ideas up in flowery language but I still think I have a point that is important.  As someone who has been a victim of violence as a result of queering identity it is not more important to me to have legal rights. It is more important to me to induce social change that will prevent me from getting horribly violently assaulted yet again as a result of how people perceive me. I know for a fact the government/police/rights don't prevent this from happening. Trying to argue for a sexual politics that respects people regardless of how or with whom they have sex is what is important to me because I don't want to face that threat of violence any more and I don't think anyone should. To me that is needed to do something rights can't. Rights don't work so well in the real world; we have a right not to be violently assaulted but it happens all the time.  You are belittling real problems that real people have so that you can push what you see as more important."

Gender is how a person identifies and expresses themselves as male or female, or—for many—somewhere in-between.   There are also people who consider themselves outside the gender binary or off the spectrum of gender entirely. They acknowledge that later by defining ""agender"", ""third gender"", and ""trigender"", but positing an incomplete interpretation of gender right from the start isn't very good for the writer's credibility. Still a reasonably useful guide but I'm guessing there are better out there."

radicalqueers,2yn9m1,Zhuangzifreak,2,Wed Mar 11 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"My gender issues as a child were not too severe. I had a definite feeling that I was not a ""real boy"", that I didn't really want to be one, and that I could never be a ""real man"", and any sort of sexism or machismo annoyed me greatly. But I did not consider myself a girl, and genderqueer wasn't really an option for a child in the 80s/90s, so I was mostly fine being a not-quite-real-boy.  However, gender aside, I suffered from severe social phobia and depression, and was incredibly afraid of school. The reason I mention that is that I think what I encountered there was an attitude that affects trans* children a lot: The attitude that adults always know what's best for a child, even if the child right in front of them is clearly suffering due to their decisions. I'm not quite a proponent of totally anti-authoritarian parenting, I think in some regards parents and teachers sometimes do have a better grasp of the situation than children, simply due to more life experience.   But that should never extend to a child's inner feelings. No matter how much older you are, or how much more experienced, you can't tell another human being, child or adult, what to feel. You can't force a child to not be depressed, and you can't force a child to change their gender identity. In cases like those, adults simply don't know best, because it's an experience entirely internal to the child. As far as their own mental state is concerned, children are absolutely more qualified to make an accurate assessment than anybody else. Parents and teachers and even doctors can't just look into their brain and tell them, ""oh, but this is what you really feel!"" (And if they could, as some experiments with trans people show, they would probably find that the facts support the subjective experience of the child, rather than the externally applied social norms).   When children talk about their own thoughts and feelings, their own state of mind, they are the leading expert. What they say should be taken seriously, and not disregarded simply due to their age."

But I see some problems with the way this person(s) is talking about queerness.   sellers willing to acknowledge us economically as a market, and thus socially as a people.   This is massively problematic as a statement toward a radical queer anything. If we want queer to be an economic recognition and then proximal market reproduction of norms, identities, ways to be gay, et cetera, then we're already there. I don't need mafiosos to recognize me as a source of profit, that isn't a good part of a radical project.  This might seem like a cherry picked phrase that doesn't have much to do with the thesis and I understand the phrase was written as a reflection on the past, but the rhetoric continues. We see that the LGBT folks have had their attempts at liberation subsumed and consumed by capital, restrictive gender and sexuality, et cetera. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past by expecting the world to see queer as some category of identity, as a coherent group with limits on being within it or as something which can be marketed to because we can see what ""being queer means,"" is not going to challenge the restrictions of sex, gender, sexuality, coherent categorization is part of our problems.  Ok, so I fully agree that intoxication culture in many places is absolutely horrifying and clearly needs change, but I don't think making over-broad statements about how ""queer people"" as a group should act is the way to fix it. Saying that queer people do or should act a certain way is absurd to me; it pulls queer back into bullshit identity politics.  We need to recognize in our thoughts and our actions that queer should not be made another category, not something which can be prescribed to, not a particular way of being, but the doing away with these things. Queer can be a practice of queering of restriction (including norms of intoxication) but not if we reproduce it as an identity (amounting to a, slightly less formal, umbrella LGBT category) with its own normative restrictions.  So it is fair to look at the negative effects that drink and drug have on people around you, we can even make comment on the relationship between intoxication and LGBT circles (which this article was great on), and trying to make spaces without intoxicants is very helpful for a lot of people, but pretending to be able to prescribe a certain lifestyle to queer people seems like a step backwards to me.  What we need is a situation where people's drug and drink use is less likely to become a problem, where people aren't alienated by capital or whatever; communities where drug problems can be managed to the benefit of the addict/everyone, where the negative effects that are talked about in the zine can be minimized, not just blamed on the drunks. Some people will/do want intoxicant free environments, and they should be able to have that as well. However, I don't think saying queer people should be straightedge is a step toward that. Alienation, self-hatred, et cetera don't fade once the afterglow does, because society is still here.  TL;DR: Blaming intoxication for problems within the ""queer community"" is like blaming drugs for poverty, we can see how it makes it worse for a lot of people, we can see how it contributes to the reproduction of restrictive categories and shit positions in the world, but to say that people should stop doing drugs to help alleviate their poverty is looking at the problem wrong. I think drugs should stop being done in a way that perpetuates poverty, or sexual categories, or misery, or that hurts people, just like anything else."

There is reportedly no talk of reparative therapy in the first episode, and there is reportedly no insinuation that these men will ever be free of their same-sex attraction.  Not saying we should celebrate this kind of show being broadcast to America, but ""queer"" is never presented as fluid in the media, and here's a show where same sex attraction is presented as hardwired, while the cultural label ""gay"" is presented as a social counterpart to that attraction."

So, I don't think we can really wholly condemn or approve queer civil rights actions because surprisingly they aren't a homogeneous population, sometimes ""the movement"" does more good than bad, sometime the reverse is true. We have to do the hard work and judge instance by instance when the mainstream lgbt movement is doing good and when it isn't, if we want to stop using identitarian labels we have to do that sort of legwork.

If we want to argue against the rigidity of identity then it doesn't help to assume identitarian unity by acting like there is actually a homogeneous, coherent LGBTQ movement united by queerness.  (PS: this isn't to say that organizations, actions, et cetera can't be criticized.)"

radicalqueers,2oc767,LanceWithNoPants,2,Sun Dec 7 11:42:40 2014 UTC,"This article I think is, at best, misguided. First of all, just because some companies you don't like supports the Human Rights Project does not mean that the HRC is involved in some mass conspiracy with the military-industrial complex to oppress LGBT people and minorities. That's just a ridiculous genetic fallacy and borders on conspiratorial BS.  I, for the most part, agree with the analysis related to hate crime legislation. Expanding the power of the state only helps nobody.  Though she's completely right that there are other, deeply systemic problems in the military, that doesn't diminish the accomplishment of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The issue of being treated equally before the law if you're LGBT is quite different from the issue of the state being an abusive, oppressive perpetrator of injustice If we're going to have a military, it might as well treat LGBT people equally. It's definitely true that main-stream gay rights liberals have oversold the accomplishment of DADT, but that doesn't eliminate the small accomplishment of equal treatment entirely.  And the thing about marriage equality is simply wrong. Marriage may have started out as a means of simply transferring property, it may have started out mired in the ancien regime of viewing women as property, it may have once simply served the economic needs of people. But to continue to critique marriage against on those grounds is simply idiotic; I know this might come as a complete surprise to people who put more emphasis on moral outrage than positive analysis of society (both on the radical right and left), but social institutions can change. Marriage in 2014 is simply not the same thing as marriage in 1950, forget under the sexist laws of the nineteenth century. Today, marriage has evolved to being about an expression of romantic love rather than simply serving economic needs, I don't see why wanting LGBT people included in that is so horrible. Marriage is not essentially oppressive.  Sure, there are problems with the way the state is enforcing marriages. Those 1300 legal rights attached to marriage should probably not exist, and ideally the state would have nothing to do with the romantic relationships of anybody. However, as long as we're going to have a government conferring rights relating to property acquisition, what's wrong with wanting gay people treated equally by that government?  Yes, these issues the mainstream gay rights movement are addressing accomplish far less than liberals admit and the statists in the mainstream gay rights movements fail to see the problems attached to using government to advance gay rights to begin with. However, the claim that these accomplishments are nothing or are inherently oppressive simply should not be taken seriously.  All that said, I am in 100% full agreement with this sentiment: ""What we should be celebrating (and supporting) doesn’t tend to come in the form of national military or marriage policy. It is everyday resilience, resistance, and struggle."""

If you want to bring people in, your org has to be a place where people know stuff is happening: mixers, movie nights, murder mystery parties, political events, guest speakers, panels, bake sales, whatever. Just throw a bunch of events at the wall and see what the community responds to. My friend and I thought thought it would be silly and fun to do a drag murder mystery party and it's now our biggest annual fundraising event of the year.  Go out of your way to cooperate with older, more established orgs every chance you get. Black student unions, feminist groups, and activist groups are usually warm to the idea of organizing events together, in my experience.  It gives you organizing experience and gets the word out about your group to the kinds of people who like joining groups."

radicalqueers,29g43b,javatimes,0,Mon Jun 30 04:22:43 2014 UTC,"The author mentions explicitly the US, so maybe things are looking different there, but from my perspective here in Germany (with currently no same-sex marriage, but civil unions), it really doesn't look all that much like this to me:    We will have to justify our reasons for not marrying, and any relationship that survives past a certain sell-by date will be looked at as pre-marriage.    Most straight couples I know are not married, even when they're in their mid 30s. Those who are, usually did because and when they wanted children. I don't view my friends who have been in a stable, committed relationship for 10 years as any different from those who are married. Parents and grandparents of course might deploy the occasional ""so, when are you two getting married,"" but I'd say within my generation, being officially married (or ""civil-united"") is not seen as the main factor in a relationship anymore, for straight or queer couples.    Our community’s pluripotent, mutable ways of loving one another are fast becoming something we need to defend all the more to the straight world – and, now, perhaps to our married gay peers as well.    I think for any relationship other than a long term one between two lovers, not much is changing. Things like poly were not mainstream before and will not be mainstream with gay marriage. Non-traditional relationships are also in no way exclusive to queer people. Regardless of gender or orientation, people who feel they need to defend such relationships now most likely also had to do so before.    (If the revolutionary spirit of Stonewall lingers anywhere today, it is in the growing transgender movement, where activists still embrace a transformative concept of justice that questions social institutions before – or instead of – asking to be included in them.)    This I absolutely agree with, and I think that's not at all a negative thing. I see it as the next level, and not as the final one; society's views on gender are changing, and if this is successful, if this makes people question gender roles and stereotypes, then this could be an important step also in getting rid of the things that are bad about the institution of marriage. Of course, this can't come soon enough for many trans* and generally gender-nonconforming people, but at least to me it seems that it has gained traction from the marriage debate and will probably retain it once gay marriage is universally recognized.     We have gone from dismantling an inherently flawed system that privileged some people based on their sexual relationships    Maybe by ""sexual relationships"", the author here just meant ""relationships based on physical gender"", but otherwise I would have to strongly disagree here, and actually see this as part of the problem. Sex (as in, the sex act) is not the main factor in marriage. I think it is much more about social relationships than sexual ones. Romance, friendship, love, children, job, money, etc.   I am in principle in favor of the state just giving civil unions to any group of consenting adults, and leaving ""marriage"" for people and their ideologies to define for themselves. However, I am pretty sure that if this was done, people would just call those civil unions ""marriage"", anyway. They do here with same-sex civil unions. Nobody seriously says, ""this is my officially registered partner"". So I think, true marriage equality is still a goal to strive for, and if the prescriptive, outdated gender norms are removed from it, it's not at all a bad thing or harmful to queer people or queer culture. I do not feel straightened at all, and I doubt this will change, should I eventually marry."

Are you looking to give a general global overview of queer activism, or compare queer activism in two or three different areas?  If the latter is the case, I would highly recommend using the US as a static variable, so to speak, to demonstrate our own reality, and then compare with groups in Eastern Europe (Russia would be a great example, but many countries in Eastern Europe have queer activists playing their part), as well as from nations in Africa (there are quite a few there as well.  Look up Spectra Speaks for a place to start), and possibly in Asia (check out stuff in the Middle East, or possibly India, or to shift gears entirely, China and Southeast Asia).  Beyond that, you might compare the US to Europe (there will be plenty of literature about this), or more interesting, the US or Europe to Latin America.  You might also conduct a survey of queer activism in post-colonial nations (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India, to name a few that were under the British rule).  Sorry I couldn't give you any specific primary sources, but if you're hurting for info, some sort of spark should have gone off.  Spectra Speaks is pretty great, though.

Given that you're in a town like the one you describe, finding a restaurant or something with a rainbow flag will be hard to do, but once your group is more intact, you could probably start meeting at the homes of group members where you can be guaranteed safety.

radicalqueers,1zsbas,rebelrebel2013,27,Fri Mar 7 05:05:02 2014 UTC,"Because in order to have queer nationalism you have to have some defined nation that ""is"" queer, to differentiate the queer from the non-queer.  This would require drawing a line between what is and what is not queer, essentially rendering it yet another restrictive identity to be repeated and reproduced.  To say that there is some essence to queer which can be found in a subject is to bring queer into the same discourse that the GLBT movement functions within, not queering anything but reproducing restriction differently.  To me queer is not an identity, to me identities are restrictive; I see queer not as some ontological claim about myself but rather a realization that gender, sex, whatever, produce my subjectivity as stunted in its potentialities.  To build a queer nation would be to set boundaries to what it is to ""be"" queer, to me the ability to ""be"" queer ruins queerness by making intelligible within the restrictive framework of the liberal subject.  To me queer is a realization that we, as subjects, are products of the social relations influenced by the identities we are given, that there is nothing essential, or immutable about them as such, that rigid divisions are simulacra.  To put it plainly, in order to have queer nationalism we must know who is queer and who isn't.  Doing so makes queer into another identity category, which to me ruins the whole point of queerness."

Moreover, I kind of question its existence as a phenomenon.   But let's say that a white person greatly prefers the company of black people, and specifically one culture of a black neighborhood in a large city. They wear the styles of this neighborhood. They begin to pick up the local dialect naturally through exposure, but sometimes use it more purposefully to fit in better. But it's not enough. They feel like a joke, and it's causing them a lot of anxiety. They're spiraling into depression and sometimes think about suicide.   Is all of that inherently racist and appropriative at this point? Tough to say. But now they decide they want to transition to become black. That way they won't have to deal with the pain of not fully being accepted by their chosen community as a natural born member.  How do they do this? It's not like fetuses are Asian in the womb and then develop their final racial characteristics based on some hormone that's released. As we know, racial characteristics aren't consistent, they're interpreted differently based on other social context. So what would that even mean?  This, I think, is where it becomes unarguably  problematic. You have to pick and choose every detail. You aren't just introducing a hormone and letting your body change as it naturally does in response to it."
radicalqueers,1wphcf,BostonTentacleParty,2,Sat Feb 1 06:02:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I think an important difference between these two is the ease of passing.  Passing, not being unintelligible, is a huge prerequisite for a lot of trans-acceptance.  Those who pass are privileged, those who pass do not threaten the distinctions within this race.  I posted this philosophical quandary in other places and someone there brought up the historical performance of race, minstrel shows, et cetera.  Though there have been shows like Monty Python in which a parody of woman is done, it is done in drag, but these don't seem to have the same effects on producing social taboo.  Clearly race and gender are different and I am not trying to imply they can be treated the same, but the difference between our treatment of them implies a significant difference that I thought warranted further exploration."
radicalqueers,1wphcf,VixterVeronica,1 point,Sat Feb 1 18:21:36 2014 UTC,"This is an excellent question. After giving it some thought, I've postulated that the difference lies in the fundamental differences between the two concepts. Gender has more to do with behavior, while race has to do with sociopolitical economic history. Also, one can be said to be more personal, while the other more cultural.  I have much more experience dealing with my gender disphoria than I do with racial matters, but I can imagine it this way: I am white; I was born into the privileges that brings. I am also working middle class; that has similar advantages. Let's assume I was poor; I still have the benefit of racial constructs differentiating me from my phenotypically different neighbors. Therefore my whiteness has to do with both economic class and historical imperialism.  My gender, on the other hand, is different. Even though I was born with a penis, I cannot act like a ""man"" on a fundamental personal level. Therefore I am trans, that is, outside the gender binary. I was born with male privilege, but that is much harder to maintain than white privilege because I am judged on a personal level, rather than passively benefitting passively from structural inequalities because of my race. I can be devalued for participating in other cultures, but I will still pass as white. When confronted with masculinity, even my defensive personal minutiae will betray me.  I could have obviously skipped some huge oversights here, so I welcome any critical feedback, and I hope that I have contributed to the discussion."

radicalqueers,1nz9yr,xneverknowsx,5,Tue Oct 8 12:25:55 2013 UTC,"Hi! I was in a really similar situation and I'm really happy to see you posted here. As a queer woman whose first/only serious relationship was with a straight man, I really appreciate your open-mindedness and willingness to learn!  Here's a little backstory: We were madly in love but oh my god, it was so hard on both of us. To make things even more complicated, he has nonverbal learning disorder (a condition similar to Asperger's that makes it really hard for him to interpret nonverbal social cues) and I have bipolar/depression/anxiety. Talk about a shitshow.  Anyway, I think you've identified the key points: communication, open-mindedness, CONSENT, and being an ally. One really important quote to keep in mind here is ""allyship is a demonstration, not an identity."" It's not enough to call yourself an ally just because you have someone in your life who's ____ (a person of color, queer, trans*, disabled, whatever). You have to truly commit yourself to learning and trying, over and over again, and it can be really tiring and hard.  It's difficult to respond to your post because there's so much in there and I can't really identify one specific thing you're asking. Like /u/starpot said, relationships are HARD. Relationships where one person's queer and the other feels like they have to ""catch up"" are REALLY HARD. Kudos to you for putting in the work. I'm completely rambling but I hope it was helpful to at least hear some support. I have a ton of anecdotes from my relationship that are really relevant, but I'm really sick (maybe strep :/) so I'm exhausted. If you respond to this post I'll probably come back and tell you some. Best of luck to you and your girlfriend!! It sounds like you really want this relationship to work and you're already doing a lot of the right things.  P.S. It sounds like she (or you, or both of you) could benefit from checking out Codependents Anonymous. I went for months and months when I was dating my ex (and should probably still be going tbh)--it changed my life and the way I view relationships. It's based off of AA so they talk about God/a Higher Power, but I'm not religious at all and I always felt very welcomed, even when talking about issues of queerness and nonmonogamy and stuff."
radicalqueers,1npg7j,apropos_cluster,6,Fri Oct 4 05:06:50 2013 UTC,"The problem with ""assimilation"" is that it's never done in the group's favor.  What many people see as ""assimilation"" for gay people is the ability to marry, adopt children, serve in the military, and to do all the thing straight people can in public, amongst other things.  The problem is that this is not assimilating a queer existence into a straight world.  It's assimilating a straight existence into a queer world.  The Assimilationist standpoint still holds that the best way to be queer is to be as straight as possible, and that you need to have a committed partner, ideally to whom you are married, and that you need to own property jointly and to have children together.  That's not queer values.  That's a straight values being pushed onto a queer world.  Yeah, it'd be wonderful to live in a world where queers could marry and hold hands and make out in public, but we don't live in that world.  We live in a world where, in order to get access to that, we have to shrug off much of what being queer entails (loneliness, being othered, isolation, sex as recreational activity, monogamy as inefficient and dangerous, among other things) in order to become more straight.  Further, here's another example of what straight people see assimilation as.  There are gay characters on Glee, and therefore gays are represented in media and equality has been achieved.  The problem is that A) We're a group of people, not a product or culture to be consumed and B) That even though there are gay people in cultural productions like Glee, they often get the short end of the stick.  Besides, I don't feel comfortable talking to my straight friends about queer sex, and I don't feel comfortable hearing about my straight friends' straight sex.  They wouldn't understand the different dynamic between us, and everyone wants to be understood.  We are solitary people living in a largely straight society that would like nothing more than for us not to exist, so we group together and try to shut out the society that destroys our existence."
radicalqueers,1npg7j,sbassoon,3,Fri Oct 4 22:52:52 2013 UTC,"First off, thank you for the response. I imagine this sub gets its fair share of inflammatory posts from outsiders for no reason other than the childish desire to start arguments, and I appreciate you response's lack of combativeness/assumption that I was here for a snotty internet fight.  I agree with you almost entirely when it comes to the problem of the assimilation of a minority group into a mass culture. The results are far from ever being mutually beneficiary. The only reason I say almost is: while indeed it is the case that specific liberties granted by assimilation (i.e. marriage) would do little but expand the scope of the institution of said liberty's normativity, does that necessarily make assimilation a bad choice when considering that it is a liberty that must be opted into? I feel that among my generation marriage has largely become symbolic, would it be necessarily detrimental to the queer community to have it as an available option, regardless of whether or not you opted for it? In short, the ""you can"" doesn't need to be a ""you must"".  Beyond my lack of understanding of the anti-assimilationist stance, I guess overall I posted out of a pragmatically based sense of worry. I'm from an extremely conservative city (Phoenix) but currently live in a rather liberal city (Vancouver). Seeing the cohesion of the right's extreme's, and not to mention their near-centrists worries me greatly. Those who lean right share a powerful voting pool of businessmen who do it purely for financial gain, backwoods assholes who hate any minority out of skewed ideas of nature and morality, those who simply vote that way out of mindless habit, and extremist Randians who seem to have no problem preaching total liberty while voting for parties who enact anything but. The left, while surely having its mindless habitual followers, suffers from sever atomization of any sect that has indeed thought about the problems at hand but reached different conclusions via their specialized interests. It worries me, it worries me greatly."
radicalqueers,1npg7j,sbassoon,4,Fri Oct 4 23:43:20 2013 UTC,"While ""you can"" get married is certainly valid, that won't stop society from pressuring ""promiscuous"" queers into marriage.  There's already a growing undercurrent of queers who eschew those ""other queers"" who aren't interested in much beyond a hookup, and that's the voice of culture speaking through queer individuals.  How long until the queer community turns on its own even further, using slut shaming and anti-consent rhetoric that men constantly use on women to control them?  I certainly agree that if there are unequal rights, they must be made equal, but that doesn't mean they should exist, period.  Take Don't Ask, Don't Tell, for example.  Why do queers want to go to war?  Why do we want to die for our country's every whim?  I certainly don't, but I support that other queers might.  In fact, I'm a lot more conservative myself than I project on here.  I'm pretty close to strict monogamy and I think it's great to get married -- but I'll be damned if I'm going to let society pressure others into it as well.  We don't need that, on top of all sorts of other heteronormativity going on.  I'm afraid I don't understand your second paragraph?  You're concerned the left can't stand up to the right when radicals disagree largely with society?  Frankly, good.  Because the left is as full of shit as the right.  I don't want to speak for all radqueers, but I'm here partly to dismantle society and to bring it to a proper state of existence, and a large part of that is the destruction of the political system as we know it."

It's even more fucked up when used by those calling themselves trans that have never experienced physical dysphoria.  For you it's political, for me it's medical.  I have nothing against the queering of gender roles, I'm against those that think me being who I am is incorrect.

radicalqueers,1jyprn,puppyotto,4,Fri Aug 9 02:33:00 2013 UTC,"Mostly agree; but lol at claiming /r/feminisms is ""inclusive"". That place is a well known shithole of unaddressed cissexism and transmisogyny which only seems to be getting worse with time."
radicalqueers,1jyprn,Aislingblank,2,Tue Aug 13 07:40:34 2013 UTC,Any comments on the analysis of our posting guidelines?
radicalqueers,1jyprn,damballa,1 point,Thu Aug 8 17:10:37 2013 UTC,"From the article:   The subreddit r/radicalqueers asserts its inclusivity through prohibitions on various kinds of ‘oppressive’ language: ‘Do not post content or comments that are sexist, racist, queerphobic, transmisogynistc, ableist, classist, ageist, or are otherwise oppressive.’  ...  r/radicalqueers ends the list simply with a mention of language that is ‘otherwise oppressive’. This has the effect of restricting the identity constructed/projected by the subreddit to those who have an understanding of some of the ideologies surrounding oppression. While this strategy immediately appears to foster inclusivity, it also appeals to a wider narrative of ‘oppression’ to define the limits of the intended audience of r/radicalqueers, though the sidebar never explicitly mentions such limits.   I'm not sure what the authors' point is.  Are they arguing that we're being hypocritical by appearing to be inclusive, while prohibiting certain kinds of participants?  Do they think we should be more explicit that not everyone is welcome to participate?  IMHO, it's impossible to discuss anti-assimilation without a thorough understanding of oppression.  And IMHO, it would be fine to explicitely say we're not welcoming to folks who don't share our understanding of oppression."
radicalqueers,1jyprn,interiot,5,Thu Aug 8 20:08:04 2013 UTC,"I think they are illustrating various ways to define identity.  Whereas gaybros uses examples of what to discuss (which is a positive way to define it [positive as in ""this is an example of what to do""]), we use examples of what not to discuss (which is a negative way to define identity [negative as in ""this is what not to do""]).  I don't think the paper, because of all of its academic jargon, made this very clear.  It's merely an analysis of how subreddits define themselves in their sidebars, and how that definition affects the identities of the members."
radicalqueers,1jyprn,sbassoon,3,Thu Aug 8 21:14:00 2013 UTC,"It's not judging the subreddit negatively nor critiquing. It's analyzing what assumptions are embedded in the wording itself. In reference to this sub, it's saying the sidebar assumes participants know what the current discourse on oppression is, in that it doesn't itself explain what, say, ""sexist"" language is. Meanwhile r/gaybros takes for granted what it means to be ""manly"" and assumes all participants share that understanding. So what it is saying is that overall, those embedded assumptions work to both define participation and also reinforce in participants what their identity means. (For instance, being a radical queer has as a necessary component understanding oppression discourse.)"
radicalqueers,1jndvv,intlnews,2,Sat Aug 3 22:34:39 2013 UTC,"While there's nothing at all wrong with monogamy as a choice, the public fight for gay marriage is nothing but an attempt by liberalism to co-opt another demographic and use it to further shore up the oppressive structures of our capitalist society with an institution that'll only further benefit the rich while distracting everyone from serious issues that matter to the queer community, just like always gets done with the rest of society.  Because the poor, young, and minorities don't matter to the elites."

radicalqueers,1gng8l,Hobo_Handjob,8,Wed Jun 19 12:30:06 2013 UTC,Can someone explain how it's a parody of itself? I don't really understand what the critique is... Is it not something queer rights should focus on?
radicalqueers,1gng8l,lucky16duckie,18,Wed Jun 19 20:48:25 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure how familiar you are with radical queer politics, so I apologize if this is too basic, but generally there are two schools of thought in the queer/LGBT lib movement: the mainstream assimilationists; and the radical antiassimilationists.  The former group (/r/lgbt types) are concerned making our current society more accessible to and equitable for queers.  The latter (/r/radicalqueers type), generally, see the current society inherently antagonistic to queers (and most other people) and therefore oppose efforts to assimilate queers within such a fucked up society.  Generally, the latter would sooner help destroy and remake the current dominant society, or would construct a parallel society that is hospitable to queers.  One of the easiest ways of telling the difference between the two in practice is that the mainstream side of the movement tends to focus on reforms that would really only benefit the most privileged members of the queer ""community"" -- usually upper class, white cismales -- while one of the hallmarks of the radical side of the movement is solidarity -- ""an injury to one is an injury to all,"" and so on.  Radical queer actions, then, are inclusive of ALL queers, even the ones that don't appeal quite as much to the mainstream (like queer people of color, trans* people, poverty-stricken queers, disabled queers, and any combination thereof).  It doesn't seem to matter much to the mainstream side that thousands of queers are dying every year due to issues like sexual violence, HIV/AIDS, colonialism, lack of queer/trans-friendly healthcare, poverty, and queer suicide epidemics, because the majority of people who are most affected by these issues are extremely underprivileged.  These are people who, because of their lack of privilege, will not be accepted into mainstream society any time soon because, let's face it, mainstream society is incredibly racist, classist, ablist, etc.  Because the mainstream is primarily concerned with assimilation into mainstream society, they're typically very willing to overlook those issues that affect underprivileged people in favor of issues that only affect privileged people.  ""Privileged people,"" I assume their thought process goes, ""have more of a shot at getting accepted, so let's focus on their [relatively inconsequential] problems and throw everybody else under the bus.""  Here's the parody: there are SO MANY things that could be done to help underprivileged queers, but there are only a few in comparison that can be done for privileged queers.  Same-sex marriage is an obvious one.  But with the blood drive thing, it seems like they're really trying hard to ""do something for LGBT people"" without actually deigning to do anything for underprivileged queers.  If not being able to donate blood is your biggest concern as a queer, then you're doing pretty well compared to the thousands of other queers who are actually being significantly oppressed.  I hope this is somewhat clear.  And I hope somebody else can offer a more succinct explanation."
radicalqueers,1gng8l,banquosghost,5,Thu Jun 20 00:08:26 2013 UTC,"I'm completely with you on all of this (it's why I come to this sub) but honestly I find it difficult to get mad about stuff like this, because it's certainly bullshit that we can't donate blood, and while it ought to be much lower on a priority list, I'll take it over shit that actually hurts us. Like I'm so used to people perpetuating stuff that actually hurts us in overt ways (and yeah I know this is indirectly damaging insofar as it ignores like, everything else that matters) that even this is kind of, meh. I'm not jumping up and down or anything.   The marriage equality things is what gets me. Like, I'm excited for people I know who will be able to get married, but really the whole thing just affirms the privileging of particular relationships that mine will never share. I'll never be able to have a legally recognized marriage. So fuck me right? I get more angry about the marriage campaign than this."

That being said, my best friend lives there, so I was invited and able to stay in his home at the sanctuary.  I've been to other festivals, Burning Man, etc, but this was the first time in my life I felt truly At Home.    The community is amazing, the open-ness, the freedom, the self expression, .. all very life affirming to me.  I remember the second day I was there, telling my friend I realized ""I am normal, its the society I live in thats crazy"".  this is something I've always intuitively felt, but actually experiencing it was very healing.    The Sanctuary itself is beautiful, the food is amazing, the people are incredible, ... I simply cannot say enough good things about it.  Witnessing the Beltane Maypole ceremony was one of the highlights of my life.  What this group of individuals is doing, in my opinion, is something like holding a portal of energy open so that people like us can come and rejuvenate our souls.

I tend to think there is at least a small element of willful erasure going on here, like a lot of these journalists probably heard that Manning is apparently trans*, but fear that making too big of a deal out of this fact will add another layer of controversy to an already polarizing issue because of what a hot-button topic trans* rights are. There could also be an element of embarrassment about trans* folk from a lot of ""LGBT"" folks that's causing this fact to be downplayed (just like with trans women's role in the Stonewall riot), as well as appropriation of Manning's identity by the gay community. Really, the only time I've seen anyone make a big deal out of Manning's transness it has been as a way of showing that they're ""mentally unstable"" because of it."

radicalqueers,1ct0xi,javatimes,9,Sun Apr 21 16:39:10 2013 UTC,"Are you sure she/her are the right pronouns?    First, personally I think academic queer theory is not necessarily the same as radical queer ness. Queer theory might be interesting to read about, but it still is an academic, top-down, somewhat rarefied thing.  Some of it also suffered from a lack of intersectionality which from a lay perspective is an idea that forms of oppression are not and should not be considered as independent--there are interrelations between named oppressions.  A lot of these idea came out of the feminism of people of color, particularly black women.  For an early and formative example of this, see the Cohambee River Collective's piece here: http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Black-Feminist-Statement.html  This and things like it are the seeds of current ideas around intersectional approaches.  That said, let's go back to your questions.  What is heteronormativity.  Without resorting to wikipedia, let's say that heteronormativity, heterosexism, and homophobia are all related.  Heteronormativity defines normal relationships as between one woman and one man, and society is set up to value this relationship as above all others.  Anything outside of that is considered abnormal and has been pathologized and criminologized.  Homosexuality was in the DSM until 1974, and people received brutal treatments trying to ""cure"" them, some of which continues now such as reparative therapy.  Same sex sodomy laws are on the books in many countries and were outlawed in 13 US states until 2003 when the US Supreme Court struck down Texas' sodomy law and invalidated any other similar law in any state.  In what ways do I experience oppression?  Well, I am queer and trans, in a post transition body.  Earlier in my life I was out as queer and was quite gender nonconforming and I was bullied daily from ages 10-17, including by teachers and staff.  Since then, I've had to deal with less interpersonal homophobia because I generally get read as straight since transition. When I was starting to transition, many professionals and even many community members were skeptical of queer trans people--in some countries btw, trans people aren't allowed to medically transition if there aren't going to be straight post-transition.  This ties in with heterosexism and heteronormativity.  Now as for radical queerness--well, actually I think it's pretty well explained in the sidebar here.  That said, I'm don't think there is one particular radical queer politic.  It's more many queers are radical politically and in other ways, and that's pretty much all it takes to be a radical queer."

I've seen on this subreddit and other pages like it that there is a  particular corcern over ""assimilation"". Would you care to explain what this means, and why it's seen as undesireable?"
radicalqueers,1ct0xi,andyogm,4,Thu Apr 25 23:18:00 2013 UTC,"Personally it's not a word I tend to use to criticize people because I feel if someone wants to blend in that's their choice, and furthermore its a complicated issue. That said, assimilation can be forced, and that isn't cool.  Many people feel there is a queer culture, and  resisting assimilation helps preserve what queer culture still exists. Assimilation often only applies to queers with the fewest other axes of oppression and they are expected to be racist, classist, etc just like the larger culture. Someone to read regarding this topic is Mattilda Bernstein sycamore.

radicalqueers,1bn6ev,jttran,2,Thu Apr 4 05:14:34 2013 UTC,"Thanks for your response. It's nice to see a different opinion.  Respect was defined through dictionary.com. I guess I tried not to be repetitive in using the word ""respect"" over and over, and in my mess I used admiration. In the same respect though, I do have an admiration for the different cultures that I am exposed to, and those that I've only learned from books. I admire them in the sense that I acknowledge that they are different, have their own beliefs, and traditions.  That's where I'm coming from with my respect vs acceptance. I don't think I'm blurring the lines between the queer liberals demanding equality and gay nationalism- quite neither, really. I am simply wondering if putting every orientation on an equal playing field is the best for the queer movement. By putting queers on an equal playing field with heterosexuals, we are submersing ourselves into a heteronormative culture, where, even though we will be accepted, are still subjected to assimilation. By acceptance, we'll still have statements such as ""so who's the man and who's the woman in the relationship?"" as opposed to acknowledging differences and respecting that. That goes all ways, of course- a respect for all orientation, not simply queers. Maybe that's where you got the gay nationalism idea from.  Maybe it's the lack of respect that you have for others who aren't like you (whether it be ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, etc.), but by respecting one another- maybe you're right in that it's on a larger scale that I won't even understand- I doubt that I am ghettoizing and fracturing society by these ideas.  But that might just be me. On top of that, your comment  does not create an open space for discussing ideas and learning. I am open to different ideas and would love to talk to you more about this, but please don't belittle me in your difference of opinions. Doing this is nothing but a disservice to this sub-reddit and to the idea of learning and growing. So please don't ""contribute"" if this is your style of discussing."

I would argue that in pursuing these goals, or at least pursuing these goals through this avenue it actually makes things worse.  Though the people pushing for gay marriage don't intend to it does reinforce a normative way of relating.  Same with the probably accurate assertion that it is about financial and social benefits.  These are benefits that are granted to folks by the state, ""rights"" that can only be seen as such through their exclusion from others.  Rights that constitute social control.  You must act normative, productive, and reproductive for the state and capital and then you can be treated as human.  By assimilating into that with marriage a lot of significant harm is done.  So although it may seem to have negligible adverse side effects, I argue that every step we take to legitimate ourselves within structures is one step away from abolishing them."

Also there is the fact that drag queens tend to be cis men playing a part for money, tips, performance, etc.  It makes light of a trans woman's life and trials and struggles.  While I would never ever condone the use of ""gender blackface"" it does feel a bit appropriative. We have gone from a time in history where drag and trans* worked together and many trans women did ""drag"" performances as well to a time in history where drag queens have openly mocked me for taking it ""too far.""  I think the important thing to remember is that drag queens are men.  Playing at being women, which inherently makes light of those that live that struggle.  In fact, most trans women have to pay for the ""privilege"" of passing, what with therapist visits, hormones, electrolysis or laser surgery, voice coaching, etc.  Being trans femme is anything but ""fun"" or ""profitable.""

(ex: because no, not all women are this dramatic, not all women wear dresses or make up, not all women etc) Not only can it be perceived as ridiculing women as a whole, but it's also ridiculing trans-women on another front (especially that drag queen practices are rampant in the cis homosexuals men culture).

However, I became disconnected towards the end of the piece, where it reads "" Marriage? Fuck marriage—it's nothing more than a tool to oppress women and keep people in their place. I don't care if you want a gay marriage... Your gay marriage is oppressing me, and it will continue to oppress me until we dispense with the entire system. You don't need a ceremony or a piece of paper to say you love someone. Marriage has never been anything to do with love, and people who think it is are buying into a sham invention that the patriarchy came up with to ensure the survival of their favourite tool.""  I have to disagree a little bit here and feel that the writer dabbles in regulatory queerness, the idea that there's only certain ways to be queer. I still think someone can be queer and into the whole marriage idea-- sure, marriage originally was used for primary reasons that didn't concern love, but to say gay people don't need a ceremony is a bit harsh.. Those people who want a ceremony should be able to have one without scrutiny from the queer community.  You shouldn't feel obligated to get married, nor should other people dictate how that marriage and gay identity goes about, but I still feel that marriage is okay if that's ultimately what the two people want...especially if they are well aware of the ways marriage has been used to oppress people in the past but are actively working to have their marriage not follow the same trajectory.

I'm a touch confused here, are you accusing the author of promoting conformity? The phrase, ""regulatory queerness"", seems rather contrary to me; isn't the term ""queerness"" referring to anything non-normal to the dominant culture?  I could just be thinking of queer theory though. Meh. Is it common usage, to refer to the term as synonymous with ""gayness"" or some such? :/   I still think someone can be queer and into the whole marriage idea   The point I think (I think) is that when you remove all the economic incentives, remove all the social pressures, remove all the patriarchal myths of marriage's ""nobility"", then you're left with hardly anything of any real value. Even as an empty term for describing two parties in mutual love, all the historical connotations attached would introduce unnecessary confusion and render the term effectively useless.  In short, it's obsolete and isn't worth saving. It was never anything good to start with, so why bother keeping it?   Those people who want a ceremony should be able to have one without scrutiny from the queer community.   I think it's helpful to have a look into what exactly is ceremony.   In my views, the concept of ceremony is to act as a hallmark of status, a hallmark backed up by tradition and universally recognizable by the community. It's basically a way of notifying the world that ""hey! My standing in society has changed!""  Because of the role of ceremony in the altering of status I come to regard ceremony as separate from, and distinct to, the concept of love. And out of a desire to promote relationships that are about love and not social status, I have to reason that ceremony is... like marriage... obsolete and not worth saving.  Sure, it'll stay around a bit -- it is after all just a widget of culture -- but it has no redeeming features that make it worth encouraging.  BUT, and here's the big but, BUT:  ""Nothing's stopping you from throwing an awesome party with your loved ones, just like any other night""   You shouldn't feel obligated to get married...   I totally agree.   ...nor should other people dictate how that marriage... goes about...   An individual that's against same-sex marriage isn't necessarily the same as an individual that tries to break up marriages.  IF, and only if, the couple is married for the sole reason that they're sharing mutual love, then there's nothing negative about it. Nothing positive, nothing worth keeping, but nothing negative and harmful.  HOWEVER, if the reason the couple is married include economic factors, social acceptability factors, material conditions etc. then the marriage is a purely oppressive social structure and as such, must be removed (and the participants further helped in their other struggles).  That is my logic on the matter. Others may disagree.   ...gay identity...   Is a lie. My sexual desires don't make me anything except me + my sexual desires.   but I still feel that marriage is okay if that's ultimately what the two people want...especially if they are well aware of the ways marriage has been used to oppress people in the past but are actively working to have their marriage not follow the same trajectory.   Some would say the it's impossible to have a fully non-oppressive marriage that'd still be recognizable to a traditionalist. They'd say that oppression was built into the very structure, and that any attempt to reform it from the inside will fail.  Personally, I tend to agree.  Why not just be happy in each other's company, and say fuck off to the labels?  EDIT: Spelling."

Its central idea relies on the assumption that, as homosexuals, we either tend to or ought not to find ourselves in happier positions in the so-called mainstream world.  Secondly, it casts hideously unwarranted dispersion on what the author lambastes as the ""mainstream world"". The mainstream world has been responsible for innumerable examples of culture, art, enlightened pursuit of knowledge and institutions that the author clearly takes for granted. The fact that it has even undeniable flaws is not a convincing enough argument in favor of abandoning it altogether.

Please, we've seen what happens when paradise is promised (ie. attempts at communist societies), it doesn't typically deliver.  ""Well, fuck your stable long-term relationship. If I want to sleep around, I'll do it."" Well, apart from the fact that this excerpt appears to be written by a hypersexual baby, it is also highly unconvincing. Believe it or not there are sociological reasons (eg. sociological niches that humanity has tried to fill) for humanity's selection of many of the institutions that we see today, including marriage. Claiming marriage was divinely imposed by a overarching patriarch smells like theism, which, I'm sorry, but I'm just guessing, probably doesn't jive with you either.  But, all in all, the author makes the same goddamned mistake that almost every gay radical does at some point: s/he incorrectly declares that everything s/he doesn't like about a world which is all too unfair embodies the ""mainsteam"" world. The ""mainstream"" world as you see it is a myth. It does not exist, and it never has. The fact that you label it as such makes you just about as restrictive and discriminatory as your oppressors. Please grow up."

radicalqueers,1986z2,AsaFox,3,Tue Feb 26 00:50:31 2013 UTC,"I agree that historically marriage was a very misogynistic institution, but things have changed. Allowing for same-sex marriage will damage 'the foundations of marriage', and that's a GOOD thing. Marriage has been historically broken, but it can be fixed by changing its boundaries. And what better way to do that than by fundamentally changing it from 'a contract between a man and a woman whereby the man becomes owner of the woman' to 'a contract of love and commitment between two consenting adults as equals'. And that's a change that's already happening; I know in my parents' relatively hetero-normative marriage, neither was ever the owner of the other or anything like that; they share cooking and cleaning, both have and always had jobs, both looked after me and my sister when we were kids, etc.  Having said that, if I was ruler of my own fantasy world I would ditch marriage for a sort of civil partnership system without all the religious/patriarchal/misogynist baggage that marriage has, but let's face it: that's not gonna happen. Marriage is here to stay whether we want it or not, and the best (and most realistic) way to make the best of it is to open it up a bit. Plus, if straights are allowed to do something, LGBT folk should be too."

radicalqueers,15pb8g,laserbeamwatch,4,Mon Dec 31 07:40:46 2012 UTC,"Well when we didn't know what AIDS was we only had different population groups to look at. People noticed that the disease affected a greater proportion of homosexual populations than heterosexual populations. It was then stereotyped as a gay disease. The ban came as a result of the CDC picking up on this trend. Its a relic of when blood testing for AIDS didn't exist.  There's a horrible stereotype in the US that if you're gay then you're sleeping around and more likely to have HIV. That coupled with the fact that HIV can take months after infection to be detected (3 months is what I have heard as the soonest people exposed, who test negative to the disease, have been cleared by doctors to have sex again without fear of having the disease.) means that the stereotype isn't dying easily.  There have been some widely publicized statements that some groups of gay people try to get HIV so they don't have to worry about catching it anymore because treatment for the disease is much better than in the past. This bit of media, whether it be true or not, doesn't help anybody who is trying to end prejudiced practices in blood donation. :("
radicalqueers,15pb8g,iskandarios,2,Tue Jan 1 02:54:19 2013 UTC,If the risk of disease is such a concern then they need to screen all donations for contagions. Undiagnosed STI's are hardly a phenomenon unique to LGBT.

While anger was thoroughly justified, it was also exacerbated by lack of information. For example, the onus of the response was not really on the FDA, rather on the CDC and various HHS subdivisions, which were fucked in many ways including budget cuts. The narrative wasn't a conspiracy or an act of grand malice, if you can cut one out that is. Was carelessness from religious attitudes a factor though? Yes, big-time. But it's also a story of govt inefficiency (surprise!), the emergence of a then-rare class of disease understood by hardly anyone, and the fact that gay withdrawal from doctors/clinics caused information asymmetry.  It's been a while, but The AIDS Bureaucracy explains in detail. Koop's statements about his tenure as Surgeon General, during which he tried to separate the politics from policy (ending up both promoting sex education and pissing off the White House), explain the events which follow the period covered in the book."
