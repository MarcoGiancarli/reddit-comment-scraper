streetart,3e3005,Impisheye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:05 2015 UTC,Just saw that a couple weeks back.  The backstory is that Invader got a group of people together in hi-vis vests and a hydraulic lift and they brought in traffic cones and blocked off the streets while he worked. One of his friends was directing traffic and at one point had a cop stopped for five minutes and when he let him go the cop just said thanks and drove off. Since they were all dressed and acting legit everyone just thought they were supposed to be there.

streetart,3e0qp0,juliebeans137,4,Tue Jul 21 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"Downtown off Washington St. --- Basically right across the street from Blake's Tavern, in that parking lot. Natalia Rak has a brand new one right in that same lot: Imgur"

streetart,3dyucn,Claudzilla,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:43 2015 UTC,It's in Paris. C215 is a french artist and has recently been doing a lot of these smaller pieces in Paris and vicinity :) http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/c215/

streetart,3dvpwl,omega015,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:34 2015 UTC,His work is so rad. It looks a lot like Arabic calligraphy. Can anyone verify if the design is composed of actual words or not?
streetart,3dvpwl,Mikheilm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"elSeed is from Tunisia and yes his work is based on Arabic calligraphy but its just the design aspect of it, there maybe is one or two hidden words in there but he uses the calligraphy for the design mostly."
streetart,3dvpwl,Kobinoz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"I have posted this already on another image of this wall that someone else has already posted. The Arabic script in the mural is based on a quote from John Locke and reads as follows:  'It is one thing to show a man that he is in error, and another to put him in possession of truth'  I have also shared some work in progress shots of eL Seed at work on this mural on my blog:  http://www.hookedblog.co.uk/2015/07/el-seed-paints-john-locke-quote-in.html"
streetart,3dvpwl,Hookedblog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:06 2015 UTC,Thank you! That was exactly the answer I was looking for. This adds so much to an already brilliant piece of work.
