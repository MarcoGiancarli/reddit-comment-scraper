Something special about seeing men who have trained and specialized almost exclusively in blocking or tackling suddenly having to switch up what they know and do the opposite. In all likelihood this wouldn't have been a fumbled had he not blocked the fuck out of him, he didn't even try and put hands on him as an offensively lineman probably has it down to muscle memory that grabbing is holding and thus taboo, so he just blocks the fuck out of him to the ground.   Granted the Defender has probably just as much experience holding a ball during a tackle as the Offender has tackling, but still cool seeing the game sudden have it's players using skills not at all suited for the task they now have to undertake."

HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,v4Munch,2,Fri May 8 20:33:57 2015 UTC,the ref called an interference and since it appeared there was an injury they felt it was worth a misconduct is what I'm thinking.

HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,Gameovergreeny52,3,Fri May 8 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"I guess it's not technically a correct call, it just looked like the ref gestured to his shoulder (could've been his elbow? I really can't tell from the video).   Just looked it up and apparently he did call a 5 min. major interference penalty. Confused as to why, since the player that got checked had only dished off the puck right before he got hit. The emending player was committed to making the hit by the time the puck has left.   I'm honestly so confused by that call."
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,Conorcopia,0,Fri May 8 04:13:48 2015 UTC,I don't know where you are from but I bet you are used to the NHL rule set.  I'm making an assumption (because I don't know the rules in this league) but they probably have a stricter policy on interference
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,riffler24,1 point,Fri May 8 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"NHL: Rule 56 – Interference – 56.4 – Major Penalty – The referee, at his discretion, may assess a major penalty, based on the degree of violence, to a player guilty of interfering with an opponent. When injury results, a game misconduct shall also be imposed.  IIHF: Rule 534 – Interference – No provision for a major penalty in the IIHF.  All I'm saying is that that hit wasn't interference and that I was confused by the call. If anything, I would've called it an elbow to the head. Same outcome, just a different call. But then again, what do I know? I'm not a ref."
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,Conorcopia,1 point,Sat May 9 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"If I heard correctly, any hit to the head in the IIHF is a major  regarding the interference, I dunno, maybe he couldn't choose what penalty to give"
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,riffler24,3,Sat May 9 00:36:44 2015 UTC,Any contact with the head in international hockey leads to an ejection from the game so its very possible that he signaled interference (which is the x hand signal) for the penalty and then shoulder to the head for the reason for ejection because he does make another motion after the interference signal

Obviously sometimes it's totally subjective, but this one was definitely dirty (hence the penalty and injured player).  As much as I enjoy a good hit, it is much more enjoyable when I know the player didn't just throw his elbow into a guy or skate full-speed across the ice on a vendetta hit"
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,riffler24,1 point,Fri May 8 17:24:20 2015 UTC,In my opinion that was a pretty borderline hit.  I think the penalty was only called because of the blood and how it looked.  He definitely hit the guys chest first.
HereComesTheBoom,358f6v,Rcp_43b,1 point,Fri May 8 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem is that the hit was directly to the head, and apparently in this league hits to the head are an immediate misconduct"

HereComesTheBoom,34o1cy,OperationJack,1 point,Sun May 3 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"Fielder has right to the ball, even if Belle lowered a shoulder he still would've been out.

HereComesTheBoom,34o1cy,bakershalfdozen,1 point,Mon May 4 03:09:22 2015 UTC,"Watch the video again.  Vina fields the ball unimpeded, then gets in the base path to make the tag. Belle has a right to the base path, actually he literally has to be there at that point. Belle slows up initially to not interfere and then hits him.  Even the commentators say it would have been a clean play without the forearm he threw.  Belle was out regardless because if the tag, but they called the batter out because he threw the forearm.  It's the same as breaking up a double play at second base. Now I'm not saying it wouldn't be bush league, but he could have hit him without the batter being called out, or being suspended."
HereComesTheBoom,34o1cy,OperationJack,1 point,Mon May 4 04:01:10 2015 UTC,The rule still doesn't change. It's not a clean play as Belle interferes with the play. The same call is made when a runner slides in with his legs high.

HereComesTheBoom,33y3gh,Frumbleabumb,6,Sun Apr 26 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"Fencing response:       The fencing response is a peculiar position of the arms following a concussion. Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as American football, hockey, rugby and martial arts. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.     Image i - Schematic illustration of the fencing response during a knockout. A. The individual receives a punch to the head. B. After the traumatic blow to the head, the unconscious individual immediately exhibits arm extension on the same side of the body as the site that received the blow and arm flexion on the opposite side while falling to the ground. C. During prostration, the rigidity of the extended and flexed arms is retained for several seconds as flaccidity gradually returns.

I don't want to move too far off topic here and I don't want to spark some dumb-ass debate but :   I play rugby and sure there are some big hits but not that often, because no one actively tries to slam the shit out of you (unless there's a reason and said person asked for it). Also lots of times in rugby when someone gets decked hard the player helps them back up. From what I've seen in football and hockey (watching games and gifs like on this sub) the tackling players are pretty proud and leave the wrecked dude there on the ground. Is this impression I have somewhat true or not ?   Disclaimer : I'm not saying one sport is better than the other, I'm just making an observation based on my experience."

HereComesTheBoom,3329fe,Silidon,3,Sat Apr 25 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"yes and no. the goalie can leave his box to challenge an oncoming forward, but you're not allowed to hit people's legs. that's called clipping and isn't allowed. however, in 1 on 1 situations, the goalie is allowed to go after to puck directly, and it's kind of an unspoken rule that it's up to the forward to get out of the way if the goalie comes charging. kind of like how in baseball you're allowed to try and break up the double play by sliding directly into the 2nd baseman even if he's not near the plate, it's just kind of on the 2nd baseman to get out of the way.  that said, it's pretty much up to the discretion of the ref whether you were making a legitimate play on the puck or just trying to take out the player. typically, you probably won't see a penalty. in this particular clip, he did. another ref might have called it a different way, who knows. there's no cut and dry infraction here."

HereComesTheBoom,32h15n,Hornstar19,5,Mon Apr 13 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"That's not true anymore.   The exact wording of Rule 12, Section 2, Article 8 is as followed:  “It is a foul if a runner or tackler initiates forcible contact by delivering a blow with the top/crown of his helmet against an opponent when both players are clearly outside the tackle box (an area extending from tackle to tackle and from three yards beyond the line of scrimmage to the offensive team’s end line). Incidental contact by the helmet of a runner or tackler against an opponent shall not be a foul.”  Basically any intentional helmet to helmet contact by any player is illegal.

It's also really referring to spear tackles or when a RB spears with his helmet. I don't really see that in this play. Both players were just going in full speed and Ridley braces for the hit - helmets collide and out he goes.
HereComesTheBoom,32h15n,Hornstar19,2,Tue Apr 14 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah this hit was legal then, I only brought it up because the guy you responded to asked in general and you appeared to answer in general.

HereComesTheBoom,31pg20,smiles134,4,Tue Apr 7 15:21:01 2015 UTC,didn't they make it so you can't slide into a defender that is outside the baseline though?
HereComesTheBoom,31pg20,dakoellis,5,Tue Apr 7 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"They did...ish... You aren't really supposed to, but it is rarely called.  The one thing that I have seen them push for is lowering the leg on the slide.  The MLB has pushed for individuals sliding into second to focus on the base and the ground.   There are still people who don't follow the rules, but the rule has diminished collisions to the extent that the few bad apples (slides) left are very apparent."
HereComesTheBoom,31pg20,Big24,-1,Tue Apr 7 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"I totally fell out of baseball a few years ago, so I didn't know about the catcher. But if you don't think the takeout slide will be illegal one day, you're out of your mind.  Just wait until a superstar gets injured, and it costs the right owner a lot of money or a championship."
HereComesTheBoom,31pg20,bretstar,4,Tue Apr 7 18:37:50 2015 UTC,A takeout slide is different than a regular slide.

HereComesTheBoom,30tk16,Chili440,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:55:26 2015 UTC,Rule.  No forward passing in rugby.
HereComesTheBoom,30tk16,punchnicekids,2,Tue Mar 31 05:52:16 2015 UTC,"So if he didn't pass it back would it be down? Would they start off ""hiking"" the ball, like in American football? Are there downs?"
HereComesTheBoom,30tk16,Chili440,3,Tue Mar 31 06:07:00 2015 UTC,"This is so hard to explain (and my knowledge is not great).  The aim is to get the ball to one end like a touchdown.  The ball must actually be 'touched down' - this is called a try.  The other team tries to stop this happening.  If the tacklers had managed to get him to the ground in this example, he would put the ball out for another team member to pick up.  The other team can gain control of the ball by interception.  Watch a game if you can."
HereComesTheBoom,30tk16,Chili440,3,Tue Mar 31 06:18:01 2015 UTC,"The ball can also be turned over by a ""knock on"" where the ball is dropped and bounces forward. When this happens you get a Scrum (where 8 ""forwards"" for each team try to push the other team off the ball when the number 9 puts it in the middle). Also running, kicking or dropping the ball ""out of bounds"" results in a line out where the ball is thrown in between two lines of 7 players (usually forwards) and a jumper is sent up to catch it. These are the fairly basic rules you must know, along with things like, you can kick the ball at any point but you must be behind the kicker (like kickoff in american football) otherwise you are offside. Scoring   Try - 5 points Converting the Try - 2 extra points Penalty kick - 3 points Drop kick - 3 points (can be scored at any point by any player, ball must be dropped and then kicked between the posts).   Hope this was helpful.  tl:dr watch a game of rugby with the basic rules in mind, fairly simple but be aware of some strange rules that they might throw up"

The main things you can't do while blocking in football are holding the defensive player or hitting him in the head or legs (generally). Beyond that, hit 'em as hard as you like, though hits that look particularly bad can draw penalty flags.  In this case the kicker failed to ""keep his head on a swivel"" and was handed a pretty hard hit by #14. Not pretty, but it looks like a clean hit to the chest in my opinion."

HereComesTheBoom,30iq5j,THEsolid85,7,Fri Mar 27 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"....no. Are you fucking blind or what? He hit him in the head, with his shoulder and forearm. I'll highlight all the things in the targeting rules that cover this hit:  Targeting and Initiating Contact to Head or Neck Area of a Defenseless Player  (Rule 9-1-4)  No player shall target and initiate contact to the head or neck area of a defenseless opponent with the helmet, forearm, fist, elbow or shoulder. When in question, it is a foul.  (Rule 2-27-14)  Note: Beginning in 2013, ejection from the game is a part of the penalty for violation of both Rule 9-1-3 and Rule 9-1-4.  KEY ELEMENTS  Target—to take aim at an opponent for purposes of attacking with an apparent intent that goes beyond making a legal tackle or a legal block or playing the ball.  Crown of the Helmet—the top portion of the helmet.  Contact to the head or neck area—not only with the helmet, but also with the forearm, fist, elbow, or shoulder—these can all lead to a foul.  Defenseless player—a player not in position to defend himself.                 Examples (Rule 2-27-14):                A player in the act of or just after throwing a pass. A receiver attempting to catch a pass, or one who has completed a catch and has not had time to protect himself or has not clearly become a ball carrier. A kicker in the act of or just after kicking a ball, or during the kick or the return. A kick returner attempting to catch or recover a kick. A player on the ground. A player obviously out of the play. A player who receives a blind-side block. A ball carrier already in the grasp of an opponent and whose forward progress has been stopped. A quarterback any time after a change of possession.   KEY INDICATORS                Risk of a foul is high with one or more of these:    Launch—a player leaving his feet to attack an opponent by an upward and forward thrust of the body to make contact in the head or neck area A crouch followed by an upward and forward thrust to attack with contact at the head or neck area—even though one or both feet are still on the ground Leading with helmet, forearm, fist, hand or elbow to attack with contact at the head or neck area Lowering the head before attacking by initiating contact with the crown of the helmet"
HereComesTheBoom,30iq5j,Thetmeister05,3,Fri Mar 27 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2316593-baylor-kicker-destroyed-by-michigan-state-defender-after-blocked-fg   A kicker in the act of or just after kicking a ball, or during the kick or the return.   He was clearly no longer in a process that involved kicking in any way whatsoever, he had started running toward returner and was in the best place of anyone else on baylor to make a tackle. He was no longer a ""kicker"" at that point   A player who receives a blind-side block.   It's not even close to a blind side block, it was damn near a squared up hit. The blocker was basically in front of him and really only had to stop moving.   Launch—a player leaving his feet to attack an opponent by an upward and forward thrust of the body to make contact in the head or neck area A crouch followed by an upward and forward thrust to attack with contact at the head or neck area—even though one or both feet are still on the ground.   He definitely still had at least one foot on the ground, and it looks like the other one was mid step. I could see POSSIBLY a launch based on his posture, but that's a pretty iffy call based on the video... Definitely not a crouch, though.  Finally, I can't see any clear cut shots to indicate he ever made contact with the kickers head or neck. Everything I've seen looks like a squared up shoulder to shoulder hit. I suppose considering it's ""in question"" to me, I would have to regard it as a foul, but I'm leaning strongly away from that. Also, you are literally the only person I have found calling this a bad call. There isn't a single other source that I could google with any combination of words that was questioning the legality of the hit..."

Walcott dropped Marciano in the first round and steadily built a points lead; but in the thirteenth, Walcott used his trademark feint to set up his right hand, but Marciano's ""Suzie Q"" landed first. Marciano landed a glancing right hook as Walcott slumped to his knees with his arm draped over the ropes. He lay motionless long after he had been counted out and Marciano became the new World Heavyweight Champion. At the time of the stoppage, Walcott was leading on all scorecards, 8–4, 7–5 and 7–4.  His first defense came a year later, a rematch against Walcott, 39, who this time was knocked out in the first round."

HereComesTheBoom,2yrcol,mbdude,2,Fri Mar 13 00:41:35 2015 UTC,Even if the cross checks were legal like in box/indoor this kid is shit. The hits don't help with the play and he can barely pick up the looseys when they are right in front of him.
HereComesTheBoom,2yrcol,mbdude,-3,Fri Mar 13 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"We saw 1 example of that, hard to tell if that's the norm for him. But again. He just hits. It's entertainment, not good lacrosse. Dudes an idiot, I agree."

This guy sucks. Although only 10% of those hits were legal, all of them were pointless. You can hit someone as hard as you want all day but it doesn't matter if the guy still gets the shot off. This is pretty basic shit too."
HereComesTheBoom,2yrcol,cmyer,3,Mon Mar 23 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"Jesus, I came here to say just that.  This guy would get laughed out of the ACC or any other REAL lacrosse conference.  Cross check, loose ball push.  For christ's sake, pull your hands together before you hit.  Don't extend your arms.  Its simple things, and you can STILL make big hits.  Don't gloat like a toolbag after you hit someone.  Act like you've been there before.  I would love to see him in man, because it looks like they just ran a flex zone, and kept that fool in the crease.  If I was an attackman, I would fire a few cranks right at his stomach and see how he likes those."

HereComesTheBoom,2ybtbi,Flaming_Eagle,7,Mon Mar 9 04:50:29 2015 UTC,Apparently Oshie forgot the Leafs played defense and thought skating with his head down while crossing the blue line was a good idea. Perhaps next time he won't make the same mistake.
HereComesTheBoom,2ybtbi,flagstomp,5,Sun Mar 8 15:25:22 2015 UTC,Whistle was blown before the hit was made. Probably wasn't expecting a late hit.
HereComesTheBoom,2ybtbi,thebenson,3,Sun Mar 8 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"Lol. Yeah probably not then. Phaneuf plays like I do in ""my player"" in the NHL video game series: huge hits, not always legal, charging, after the whistle, etc."
HereComesTheBoom,2ybtbi,flagstomp,2,Sun Mar 8 15:56:57 2015 UTC,Most of the time his hits are perfectly legal. He must just go into tunnel vision when he sees a guy like oshie cutting across with his head down. Prolly didnt even hear the whistle. One of the best body checkers to ever play hockey imo.

HereComesTheBoom,2u2msf,wolfmankipp,6,Thu Jan 29 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"The call for a hit like this is at the ref's discretion. The ruling is that the tackler has to at least make an attempt to wrap the ball carrier during the contact. Unfortunately, with a lot of hard hitting tackles the ball carrier and tackler will obviously bounce off of each other, making it impossible to get a solid wrap in the tackle.   If I were the ref I would call it, doesn't seem this ref agreed with me."
HereComesTheBoom,2u2msf,ThoughtAtWork,3,Thu Jan 29 19:30:30 2015 UTC,His arms didn't engage in the tackle around him and it was a charge with the shoulder. Yet a quick search seems like nothing happened according to the Youtube clip and the dude got straight up. Anti-climax.

EDIT: After looking at it again, it looks like he caught him with the top of his foot instead which would still hurt, just not as much as the toes."
HereComesTheBoom,2tsejr,NachoManSandyRavage,5,Tue Jan 27 06:36:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard that you should pull your toes back for that kick, so that you end up striking with the pads(ball of your foot, mainly), not any part of the toe.  If you did connect with the pads/ball, it might not hurt much at all. Still, that might be hard to execute 100% properly given the speed of the move, chin position, etc. The guy would probably consider a broken toe or two a badge of honor when winning so decisively.  edit: and I've definitely heard that you shouldn't connect with the top of your foot, as it's very easy to break those little bones. but still, if it gets the job done... :)"

HereComesTheBoom,2tsejr,Stevey854,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:53:54 2015 UTC,We're taught that the side kick should hit with the heel. But ours isn't a traditional tkd side kick.

HereComesTheBoom,2tli3e,Mikerium,5,Sun Jan 25 16:54:29 2015 UTC,unsportsmanlike conduct. Even though it was a legal block.

HereComesTheBoom,2t4l4a,ViolentThespian,2,Thu Jan 22 02:03:21 2015 UTC,He was trying to hip-check him. They're usually a lot stronger and feel like you're running into a waist-high brick wall. Thing is Miller moved into him when he saw it rather than continuing along the boards so he hit Karlsson where he was off balance instead of in his hips (where all the balance and power of the hit comes from) and sent him flying like that.

HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,HOLYTIGER,1 point,Mon Jan 12 06:59:48 2015 UTC,Called fumble on the field. Somehow overturned. Red said the punt returner had control and was down by contact. Not how I see it...
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,hismikeness,2,Mon Jan 12 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"What the video again. During the second angle it is most obvious. The right knee cleary hits the turf while the ball is in his hands. He then proceeds to faceplant the ground and loose possession, at which point it does not matter since he was being touched while one knee was on the ground with possession.   Edit: Here is the LINK!"
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,Dylox78,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"This is just a bad angle. On the replay, you can see his knee touch the ground a second before he loses control. But that's football for you, it's a game of inches.  Source: Was at the game."
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,CornyHoosier,1 point,Mon Jan 12 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"Mike Carey disagreed with overturning it. He said a player fielding a punt is subject to the same rules as a player catching a pass, that you have to control the ball and make a football move. If that was a pass it would absolutely have been incomplete. So no it's not just a bad angle, it should have remained a fumble."
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,THEsolid85,0,Mon Jan 12 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Getting tackled is a football move.  He got hit by the opposing player, then went to the ground and his knee touched well before the ball came out."
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,bretstar,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:45:37 2015 UTC,"Getting tackled is not a football move. Football move refers to what the receiver does between securing the catch and getting tackled. In this case, the receiver does nothing. The hit is instantaneous, he does not make a football move. Nor does he maintain possession through the process of the catch.  If you want to argue Mike Carey is wrong and the rules are different for punt returners then go right ahead. But the argument you're making is wrong.  * = Instead of downvoting, maybe you should take 30 seconds to Google what a football move is since you apparently have no fucking clue what you're talking about."
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,THEsolid85,0,Mon Jan 12 18:02:14 2015 UTC,First of all: If Mike Carey disagreed then you should know I'm right.  Second: The player was tackled and when falling to the ground his knee hit before he lost possession. It was a clear tackle by the defense -- Colts ball.
HereComesTheBoom,2s40dv,CornyHoosier,2,Mon Jan 12 17:49:21 2015 UTC,"Don't talk shit on Mike Carey dude. He was a damn good referee.

I'm not sure if you are familiar with American Football or not, but roughing the passer used to be a penalty for hitting the quarterback (the guy with the ball) long after he got rid of the ball.  Nowadays roughing the passer is called practically any time the QB gets hit hard, even if he still has the ball.  Any contact with his helmet is pretty much an automatically a roughing call, even if it is just a glancing blow with your fingertips while you are swatting at the ball."

He had to be moving that fast to get there in time, it's not like he was sitting on the route, he didn't hit him in the head or lead with his head, or launch.  His only options in that situation were to do what he did -- continue running through him at full speed -- or concede the catch.  Letting up would have meant that he was too late."

There was a controversy about whether or not it was actually illegal, too. There was a lot of debate. He genuinely did not know he was doing something illegal. So, anyway.. yeah.

HereComesTheBoom,2hy4av,ILoveMyselfSometimes,3,Wed Oct 1 04:11:35 2014 UTC,"It looks like he has position doesn't it? But if you look closely, it was a hook route and unless the qb could fire a hot bullet into his chest, that cb could easily pick it off if he got the jump. He's not as wide open as it may seem, especially with the pocket quickly closing around the qb, limiting his room to throw that bullet. Therefore he chose the correct option, the short dump."
HereComesTheBoom,2hy4av,fh80,1 point,Wed Oct 1 08:02:09 2014 UTC,"I don't think so. He was pretty open. That cb was anticipating a pass into the end zone and was playing kinda deep. He wouldn't have made it in time unless that qb threw it to the inside. Also, the qb doesn't have to throw a bullet into the wr's chest to make the play. He could have attempted a back shoulder throw to make sure that the ball isn't picked off. But you're right, that pocket was collapsing and he probably didn't have enough time and was under too much pressure."

HereComesTheBoom,2dxg2p,ilieetucker25,2,Tue Sep 23 02:48:40 2014 UTC,I didn't know they let ragdolls play football
HereComesTheBoom,2dxh3l,OnAComputer,8,Mon Aug 18 22:58:22 2014 UTC,That's not so much a big hit as getting kicked in the nuts.
HereComesTheBoom,2dxh3l,GenRELee,1 point,Mon Aug 18 23:12:31 2014 UTC,Whoever made this gif... It's a beautiful piece of art.
HereComesTheBoom,2dt3vf,Garzog66,18,Sun Aug 17 16:25:17 2014 UTC,And that's why my pee wee league had a weight limit for carrying the ball
HereComesTheBoom,2dt3vf,iyager,3,Mon Aug 18 05:09:11 2014 UTC,"Putting the ""pop"" back into pop warner"
HereComesTheBoom,2dt3vf,lilguy78,2,Mon Aug 18 01:44:05 2014 UTC,Why is it called pee-wee?  Those kids are huge.  Why is football not graded by weight?
HereComesTheBoom,2dt3vf,Chili440,3,Mon Aug 18 07:51:17 2014 UTC,"most have a scale decided on age and weight. The older you were, the smaller you had to be. I played in a league that would have big ass 10 year olds playin with smaller 12 year olds. The younger players werent mature enough to know how to use their weight and the older kids werent big enough to kill anyone."
HereComesTheBoom,2dt3vf,SillyAmerican,2,Mon Aug 18 15:51:18 2014 UTC,"if there's one thing tough about pee wee football, it's the size discrepancy.  def better to wait till high school"

HereComesTheBoom,2dsnkd,AttackClown,0,Sun Aug 17 16:42:35 2014 UTC,Clowney is my favourite and most likely best player in the league!
HereComesTheBoom,2dbmzb,l8102,15,Tue Aug 12 10:08:46 2014 UTC,That's a bit harsh for the first game. Where's the old Zealand keeper gone?

HereComesTheBoom,2dbmzb,Frank_The_Hare,-8,Tue Aug 12 19:46:02 2014 UTC,"I like how the one that kneed her fell down in ""agony"". You just kneed a chick in the face how do you think she feels?"
HereComesTheBoom,2dbmzb,NoNeedForAName,19,Tue Aug 12 19:49:43 2014 UTC,"Another person is hurt, so you're not allowed to be hurt."
HereComesTheBoom,2dbmzb,bacondev,4,Tue Aug 12 21:49:53 2014 UTC,She fell down because she lost her balance when trying to turn around to see if she was okay.
