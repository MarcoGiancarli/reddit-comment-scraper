Usually if your bank belongs to a network you can get money from any ATM of the network with a low commission (or none at all).   Well, that used to be the case, now it's changing. For instance La Caixa now charges anybody that's not a customer."
Barcelona,3e3u3z,gnark,5,Tue Jul 21 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"La Caixa is actually one of the most tech savvy of the Spanish banks and is betting heavily on mobile banking. Their website leave much to be desired as it is too cluttered but the mobile app works quite well. And they are one of the more solvent banks so there's little worry of them going belly up any time soon. That being said they are far from the most economic option.   ING tends to have the best balance of online easy of use and low costs, but they have closed some offices in the last few years so you're largely limited to interacting with them online.   EVO bank is attentive and decent on fees but has a minimal number of offices.   BancSabadell is alright, no-one hates them but no-one loves them either and they're not cheap.  BBVA can be a pain in the ass.   CaixaCatalunya and Bankia are possible zombie-banks.  Santander seems to be decent but seems to be more interested in international expansion than competing for more domestic clients.   Triodos is an ethical bank, but  seems to be best for local banking options."

Barcelona,3e3bpe,ThePowerOfDreams,6,Tue Jul 21 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"If you arrive in Terminal 1, take the shuttle bus to Terminal 2B. Go into the building and follow the signs for the train station, up the escalator and through the footbridge. Use the red and white (not black and orange) ticket machines to buy your 1-zone T-10 or T-70/30; both are shareable. If you choose to use T-10s, I suggest getting two or three, then buying another one once you begin to use the last one.  The T-10 costs €1 per trip; the T-70/30 costs €0.85/trip (assuming you use them all within the 30-day period beginning from first use, or more otherwise); the savings are not earthshattering. I suggest you use T-10s for maximum flexibility and least commitment.  Remember that you transfer between train, metro, tram, and bus (up to three transfers) within 75 minutes for free; as a result, you will use fewer trips than you think!  I suggest taking the train to Passeig de Gràcia station and transferring to the metro (for free!) from there to get to where you're staying."

Last year my fil had his wallet taken on metro - we broke all the rules so our mistake but I saw them and went took police as witness. They have book of photos of them. The case took 8 months and they ended up with a month in jail and 3 months probation but not just for his wallet as they had 12 others. They try them as organised crime but they have it hard as most are tourist who see or remember nothing and don't want to go through the police system.   We went on Tuesday with in-laws.  Same routine but we saw it coming.   And the 4 policemen tearing up their stuff and hauling them off.

He was stopped by some of ""hookers"", he told them he was from the nighbourhood and that he knows them. One of them followed him to his building door, trying to enter but he stopped her. When he arrived at home he realized the phone was gone. He was pissed, but he has an insurance covering it so he just went straight to the police to report it. They showed him that book of photos and he recognized the girl.   After a couple of weeks he received papers from the court and he thought ""ok, must be the stuff from the hooker-thief"" but... he was not only called as complainant, he was also reported by the girl. The hooker-thief reported him for verbally abusing her and threatining her life, explaining that he tried to punch her in the face that morning and stuff like that. She had 4 witnesses.   Cool thing to add a little spice to the story?

Barcelona,3e174k,stewartmcg,4,Tue Jul 21 09:12:42 2015 UTC,"Hey. For rent, that should be fine. Other costs of living can be found on websites like this.  Assuming you're here with the proper paperwork (a Schengen visa), you can travel throughout continental Europe pretty easily. Most people use budget airlines like Easyjet, Ryanair and Vueling: you can get good prices on flights from BCN to dozens of destinations in Europe. You can also travel by train, which can be more expensive but more relaxing. There is a high-speed train link to Paris. Stopping at Lyon gives you options for traveling to Italy, Germany, Switzerland and beyond. There also long-distance buses.  The racism thing is harder to answer. There isn't a very large Sikh population here and unfortunately, many locals will consider you to be a 'Paki', which carries strong negative vibes here. Spain has only had immigration from the subcontinent for a few years and so a lot of people here are just less used to having people of different races or religions around. Which inevitably leads to problems with generalizations, and so on. I've been told by people in a similar situation that they've had problems with security at some nightclubs for exactly this reason.  Personally, I have it easy: the worst thing that happens to me is that locals sometimes think I'm yet another 'guiri' (English tourist), until I let them know that I understand what they're saying. Things might be harder for you but I honestly don't think you should let that put you off. On the whole, this is an open, friendly city."

Here the racist attitude is more like ""all muslims sell beer in the streets to tourists"". The real hostility is reserved for Moroccans and Roma.  There are quite a few sikhs in Raval, which is the most multicultural (and in my opinion, best) neighbourhood. There's a Gurudwara in Carrer Hospital.   On the whole, this is an open, friendly city.   This seems very true to me. It's a very multicultural place, and not just settled people, but foreigners from all over studying and working here.

Barcelona,3dxhmx,antonia90,3,Mon Jul 20 13:47:06 2015 UTC,Obviously there's a level of subjectivity when it comes to classing something as cheap or expensive. But €6 for lunch is pretty good. A menú del día will typically cost €10.  A Big Mac costs about €4.30. I'd say that €1.70 more for a much better burger is fair enough.

There are lots of other ways to eat out cheaply and really well in Barcelona. You'll get much better value going to backstreet restaurants. For 30 Euro you could get three, large three course meals, with drinks included, at many backstreet restaurants. We often do that and feel the whole family on three meals with lots of variety.

Barcelona,3dusjc,aenemic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"I like to think that this could happen. But there are numerous barriers to its success, unfortunately. The principle one is the way these services receive funding to get off the ground. Because nearly all of the possible investors get involved in order to make money (rather than acting philanthropically), a strong, centralized revenue stream is always required. In order to work, distributed, hyper-local enterprise would need its founders and investors to be willing to leave the majority of the profits in other people's hands, not something that many people in Silicon Valley like to hear about."

Edit: Yes seems to have been Fagor. Competition from low priced asian products have made them lose money. This is hower only one of 100s of cooperative enterprises under the Mondragon name. And if something like that happens they usually find other compaines to transfer their workforce to, instead of firing."

She answered and immediately got ""all up in my grill"", shouting ""We can do what we want until 10pm!"" before I even had a chance to say anything.

If you are feeling bad about the noise, go to your neighbour and ask to see their ""permiso de obra"" which should be one of these. This permit should already be posted in the lobby and his door btw. So you are on your right to ask for it if it's not.  I am sorry but i have no link in english about the permits. There are 4 kinds. You should check which one it is because most people usually get the ""assabentat"" which is for minor cosmetic things such as painting because it is a free permit. The rest cost money and need in site approval of the ayuntamiento.   If you think they have no permit or the wrong one you can call the police and they will stop the works."

Barcelona,3dajct,Syatek,9,Tue Jul 14 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Walk/bike a lot. Like, a lot. Never take the bus or metro and go to the beach every day. You will get a crazy tan, and lose a lot of kilos!  In terms of food, buy a lot of veggies (at the Boqueria market for example), and cook salad. It's easy as pie: you just cut all your veggies in small cubes, add a dash of olive oil and vinegar, salt, pepper, mix it all, and you're good to go. Plus it's fresh!  Finally, drink a lot of water!"
Barcelona,3dajct,hpoutrelle,2,Tue Jul 14 20:36:00 2015 UTC,How is biking in Barcelona? Is it dangerous and not as popular or is the city more accommodating of it? I'll be living there for four months in the fall and was thinking of biking around instead of riding the metro all the time (save money too)
Barcelona,3dajct,muffinchopped,8,Tue Jul 14 22:49:25 2015 UTC,Biking is very popular!
Barcelona,3dajct,BendyBobcat,2,Wed Jul 15 03:11:00 2015 UTC,Popular but fairly dangerous. I used to commute by bike. Cars have absolutely no regard for bike lanes and their occupants. It's really dangerous when there's a truck parked and you are going against the cars.

Barcelona,3dajct,Dekken_,2,Wed Jul 15 05:52:18 2015 UTC,"Cut the starchy carbs. Eat little else but meat/veg.  Learning to cook will benefit you greatly in the long run.

Barcelona,3d94ok,Bigardo,3,Tue Jul 14 14:26:59 2015 UTC,"Since your clients are probably not Spanish, there's no reason or requirement to register here.   If you're physically present in Spain for more than 183 days (including sporadic absences), you're 'resident for tax purposes' and are obliged to pay tax in Spain on all your worldwide income.    After those three or four years, with that kind of income you'd be paying 250 € + 30%, so less than 40%.   To put that into perspective, on those earnings, in the UK you'd pay 17% of it.   OP: You're right in that you need an accountant or gestor. I had one but she turned out to be absolutely useless, so I'm also interested in recommendations.   The tax regime here is ridiculously hostile to entrepreneurs and small businesses. If Spain adopted a UK-type system they'd have millions of people off the paro in a few months, and doubtless loads more taxes being paid to boot."
Barcelona,3d94ok,motobrit,2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:01 2015 UTC,Can't make autonomos cheaper than regular workers or companies would abuse them. I don't know how they avoid this in the UK.
Barcelona,3d94ok,Sugusino,2,Tue Jul 14 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"Surely autonomos cost nothing to businesses, so are already cheaper.  And companies do abuse the system. I have a friend who works as a teaching assistant. She's been at the same school for at least six years.  She's autonomo. This is a public school in a village in the Canaries. It's clear as day that she's not really self-employed; they just don't want to give her a contract or pay her social security.   In the UK, companies are fined if they employ staff without paying their taxes through the PAYE system. The idea of a school doing this is unthinkable."
Barcelona,3d94ok,motobrit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:53:05 2015 UTC,"They don't cost nothing. They cost the autonomo fee, if it were lower they would cost less."
Barcelona,3d94ok,Sugusino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:13:28 2015 UTC,"No, the 'autonomo' pays the autonomo fee out of their own pocket, not the employer."
Barcelona,3d94ok,motobrit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:21:07 2015 UTC,Which makes the company pay more for the autonomo to receive a living wage.
Barcelona,3d94ok,Sugusino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:26:57 2015 UTC,"You have to pay taxes but you can still be registered as self-employed in the UK as far as I know.  Totally agree though, the whole thing is ridiculous and needs an overhaul."

Barcelona,3d94ok,maxgregor,3,Tue Jul 14 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"oh god, where to start...  If you're resident, you (have to) pay taxes here for all your worldwide income. Period.  Regarding social security, there are some discounts for new self-employed people, the (in)famous 50€/month are only for the first six months.  Income tax is the same for everyone. That 9% (7% since last Sunday) is the withholding of invoices to national business for starters (remaining of first year plus two more). Foreign (business or not) and individuals don't apply this withholding. As self-employed you have the obligation of filing your tax declaration every year, that's where the income tax scale is applied.  30k gross per year for a starting translator is more than enough to pay your taxes. I know the fiscal system is a bit fucked up at first glance, specially for a starter self employed but that's no excuse.  A tax advisor for a self-employed individual should not cost more than 250€-300€/year."

Last year my girlfriend was in a similar situation and when she called nothing useful, then she went there asked again and again, insisted and insisted and voila, someone knew what the problem was. It got solved within the day. You could also go to UB's Secretaria General or something like that (just made up the name). In my experience they can be totally unhelpful or save your day in 5 min. So if you can redo what you've already done, do it.   Good luck, if you need something don't hesitate to contact me!

Barcelona,3d6gcb,maxg900,3,Mon Jul 13 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"The biggest party festival in Barcelona is called sonar. It will take place on the 16-18 June next year, so save the date if you like good techno & house music. During these three days, numerous unofficial events are organised throughout the city. These ""off-sonar"" events are much cheaper than the official ones, and better according to some (less commercial at least). Some are secret, but you should find most of them on residentadvisor.  Another EDM festival with big names is DGTL. 2016 dates are not yet announced I think, but it should take place mid-august.  The biggest nightlife spot of Barcelona is Port Olympic, where you'll find nightclubs playing dance music and hits (Pacha, Opium, Shoko, CDLC, etc.) Those clubs are really nice, because you can go chill on the beach and come back whenever you want. You can also get in for free before a certain time using my guest list application (I work as a night club promoter here).  Finally, if you prefer more alternative parties, check residentadvisor. It's one of the best sources of information about the tech/house music scene in Barcelona, and you'll find the listings of the city's most famous clubs, every day."

Your iPhone is covered by a worldwide warranty directly from Apple. If you did not buy AppleCare+ from Apple, physical damage is not covered — but it can be covered for a fee.  Go into any Apple Store (there is one in Plaça Catalunya) and ask for ""out of warranty service"". You do not need an appointment, but you may have to wait a couple of hours (or perhaps a day or two — they will make a walk-in appointment for you) to be seen.  You will pay a fee, and they will replace the phone. The new one will inherit the remaining warranty of the old one (which will still be in force).  Move your SIM from the old device to the new, and you're back in business; you don't even need to notify T-Mobile.  For more peace of mind in the future: 24 hours after receiving your replacement iPhone, call Apple in the US (+18002752273) and ask them to sell you AppleCare+ over the phone by credit card. $99 later, your one year warranty is increased to two years, worldwide directly from Apple just like now, and covers up to two incidents of physical damage for a small fee. (AppleCare+ is not sold in Spain, and the non-plus AppleCare they do sell doesn't cover physical damage; that's the plus — but if the device has AppleCare+ purchased in a country where it's sold, the extra damage coverage applies in all countries.)  PM me if you need assistance, and I can walk you through the process.  Source: I am an Apple Certified Technician and I have been on the other side of the counter."

Pay has been cut ""only"" to 80k because oposition didn't let the government team to cut salaries as they wanted (to around 40k), which is what Barcelona en Comú ethics document states.  Now, this very same oposition is selling the argument that Colau didn't made the cut she promised. Event after government team declares where the rest of salaries will go (social programs), they act like ""ok, I don't believe it""."
Barcelona,3cs2ud,maxgregor,0,Fri Jul 10 13:12:11 2015 UTC,I think making 40k as the mayor of Barcelona would be quite stupid.
Barcelona,3cs2ud,Sugusino,5,Fri Jul 10 14:10:39 2015 UTC,Why? If thats enough to live decently of and the Mayor is happy with it? Then how is that stupid?  Id rather have someone who wants to do good`while in office than someone there for the high pay. So called experts.
Barcelona,3cs2ud,aenemic,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"The issue with this logic is you exclude those who would like to do both.  Effectively you want to encourage the brightest minds how could easily earn more in other jobs. So would you like to ignore the talent just because they would like more than 40k? what if it were only 45k or 50k?  Ideally you don't hire just ""talent'"" but passion too. Best not to exclude either imo."

Barcelona,3cs2ud,Scnoofiedoofers,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:53:05 2015 UTC,It's one of the jobs with more responsability and expected work effort in the country. Having it underpaid makes the mayor susceptible to corruption or being already rich.

It is obviously early days still but the point seem to be that party ideology comes second to the specific things they want to achieve. Which was made through participatory platform where social movements, citizens and different smaller parties took part.  In my opinion, being someone who is leaning more towards Anarchism in general seems to be a good move. Decentralize the nodes of power.

I think the most important thing they can do for now is to keep a close dialogue with the relevant social movements who are fighting for human rights and decency as well as letting ""normal people"" take part in decision making in regards to their neighbourhoods and the like.  It does require a vigilant population though, but that is one of the things I admire about Barcelona compared to where I am from, there is a bigger sense of community and political awareness. Something that has no doubt been improved, if I may use that word, by the economic crisis. Mutual aid has become more important.  For now I remain hopeful!

There are plenty of drunk tramps causing as much of an issue as any tourist might.

Barcelona,3cejlp,M4nangerment,10,Tue Jul 7 08:47:22 2015 UTC,"Barcelona's new mayor to curb unsustainable tourism  Mega-cruisers bearing down on fragile heritage destinations  With cruises, OTAs, racing to ram-pack top destinations - and tourism set to grow -is this the thin end of the wedge?  The newly elected leftist mayor of Spain's second city imposed a freeze on licensing new tourist accommodation in an effort to control the growth of an industry that is causing social disruption even as it appears to cushion the effect of Europe's economic crisis.  Mayor Ada Colau said the freeze, which she expects to last a year but could be extended, will halt 30 projects that were in the process of being licensed, including some significant hotel investments.  Barcelona needs to put a brake on development and ""begin a process of participatory reflection instead of going around putting out fires,"" she said, adding ""It was a priority to impose order. Up to now, tourist policy has been handled with patches.""  Ms. Colau was immediately under fire from opposition political parties for announcing the move when Barcelona is reeling from an unemployment rate of about 20%. The mayor is ""paralyzing the city and one of the most important economic activities in Barcelona, putting investments and jobs at risk,"" said Javier Mulleras, a councilman for the conservative Popular Party.  Last year, Barcelona received roughly 7.5 million international visitors, more than four times the city's population. The number of tourist rooms available in Barcelona has roughly doubled to some 70,000 over the past 12 years. Plus a growing number of unlicensed rooms, including many private apartments rented out by their owners through 'Sharing' websites such as AirBNB  The city also receives millions more of cruise passengers who don't pay for accommodation and spend little in the city.  This is a picture that is being replicated all over the world in top level 'Must See' destinations such as Florence and Venice, Rome and Paris, New York, the Caribbean islands, Amsterdam and many more.  And, without firm action from destinations it is going to get much, much worse for destination communities powerless to act against massive global travel interests.  Why? Because in the next 15 years or so tourism arrivals are set to double from relatively new source markets who all want to see the world's wonders on the cheap.  This growth is fuelled by the rise of OTAs whose shareholders are making a massive killing without any commitment to destination consequences - Tripadvisor is now worth over $12bn, Expedia $14bn, AirBNB $25bn (which makes you wonder who gets the lion's share of the ""Sharing Economy"") and Priceline (which owns Booking.com among other algorithms) a massive $60bn. Set this against the $9bn value of the world's biggest hotelier IHG who actually work in destinations, and you wonder what hot air is worth.  And top destinations get short shrift from the burgeoning cruise market whose customers hunt in packs and don't even pay for hotel accommodation.  Venice is troubled enough now, but imagine what this fragile world heritage site will look like, and how its diminishing numbers of residents will survive, when the enormous number of megacruise vessels on order start creating effluent waves in its canals. Just one organization - Carnival - has 4 new ships shortly to be delivered with 6,600 berths each. There are 45 vessels currently on order to satisfy a much bigger market for all-inclusive holidays.  For any politician in a top destination there is no alternative to action. Soon they will have to show how tourism can practically benefit their destinations economically, culturally, socially and environmentally."

It's certainly cheaper than London, Paris, Lyon, NYC, San Francisco or anywhere else I've spent enough time in to notice.  For example, in London a single underground trip (Zone 1) is £2.30 (€3.24) with an Oyster card or £4.80 (€6.77) if you pay cash.   Paris is €1.80, Lyon is €1.40 (buying ten tickets in advance, like a T10).  The equivalent of a T10 in Madrid is over €18 if I remember correctly."

Other sources of (worlwide) income will increase those %'s.

Last question since you have kids: I found a couple of English schools - but they're about a thousand euros a month - is this normal?  We're looking at coming over for a long period so would ideally like to integrate at some point with a local school. Any advice on this?
Barcelona,3calgh,ArturGM,4,Mon Jul 6 13:06:11 2015 UTC,"I must disagree with u/kihaku1974 The school system here is not good. It is, at best, pretty shabby.  The solution to this problem is paying (in the 500-1500€/month ballpark) for a private or partly state-subsidised school, the latter usually cheaper. Most private schools are international, for two main reasons. Firstly, many employees are sent here, and do not want there children to be attending a different language school for a short while, which would probably make the fall behind, and secondly, that languages are the main failure of our public schools. Many students only learn English to a very basic level.   You must take into account, however, that the money parents pay for their child's school is not spent only to get an above-average education, but - in a more elitist manner - to have there kid grow up in a ""better"" environment, surrounded by people who are also able to pay absurd amounts of money for the school fees. This means that the school price and its quality as an educational institution are not proportional.   If you have questions regarding particular schools, please PM."
Barcelona,3calgh,kihaku1974,3,Mon Jul 6 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"each to their own - we´ve done 3 countries - 8 schools, 3 different school systems - including semi private. we like the bcn education system better than the UK system - but not as much as we liked the canadian system but maybe that is dependent on the school you are in.  my kids are doing 3 language plus english.  my oldest is back at the level she would be for maths and science if we stayed in canada after a disastrous  year in the uk where she was so bored as she had already done the work the previous year.   we are not a fan of mandated exams for children, and nor do we like bottom level for all - we like how they are being pushed here. both my kids are enjoying their school experience, both speak catalan and spanish well and some french now. but the school experience for them is also about integration with local kids and making friends. We had the opportunity to do semi private/private here and refused and there were no local kids. and my oldest did not want any religious influences in her teachers, so state it was.    will point out that my oldest tests at high grades in her subjects and her sister is following behind her - so we also push a fairly educated focus at home - when minecraft is not brainwashing them. but  I have friends who´ve moved to bcn with kids s who have autism and those kids have thrived in the state system here. something to do with small class sizes (22/24) and assistants etc."

Barcelona,3calgh,kihaku1974,3,Mon Jul 6 18:01:52 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to point out a couple of things. I went to a semiprivate/private schools (concertada/privada) and there are both religious and non-religious (semi)private schools. I went to a non-religious school. In many cases the mandatory education, primary school and secondary school (also known as ESO, 12-16 years old) are semiprivate whilst the last two years (Bachillerato / Batxillerat, 16-18 years old) are private since these are optional.  As for the kids being kept back I would say that it depends on every kid, their background and the school you enroll them into. I'm tutoring a 14-year-old who got here last year from Bolivia, she knew no Catalan nor English. She was not kept back and took basic Catalan and English classes throughout this school year in a state/public school."

There are always ads on the streets or also you could check around the school.  I'm not sure about public schools but in my (semiprivate) school they had this sort of list of older students who offered to tutor younger kids from the school. You might as well ask your school of choice if they have something similar. There are also tutoring schools around (escoles de repàs / escuelas de repaso) where they help struggling students with homework and stuff, I think. You could also check this site   I would like to say that I would do it myself but I'm not sure about my master's schedule yet but if you want you could pm and I could contact some undergrad (Chemistry) classmates / friends fluent in English"

Her catalan is very good. she is one of the youngest in her year and we dont speak catalan/spanish at home which doesnt help.   next year my oldest will be doing 5 languages - a lot of her friends speak 4 or 5 languages (spanish, catalan, french, chinese, german, polish, russian, serbian, portugeuse, arabic, ) the sooner they start with extra languages the easy it is - it blows my mind to see them code switch in the middle of conversations depending on who is talking in what language.   i would suggest that your wife take up classes in spanish and catalan if possible - if you have french or another latin based language, you´ll rock spanish and catalan. there are a few mum and dbabies groups - check out meet up or facebook."

(i refuse to make my kids do more than an hour of homework/school related study as per WHO guidelines (+30 mins for spanish/catalan translation time) so my kids work solid for that hour and then thats it. they must also read for 30 mins at bedtime - the oldest has to do 30 mins english and 30 mins in catalan or spanish. )  the school is aware of my policy and bar one teacher who felt I was not encouraging my kid to do more, and then shut up whens he brought in her first project - i´ve not had any negative responses.   Spain . yes - 140 hours of free catalan and lots of paid spanish about - if you have french or italian etc, spanish will be easier for you to pick up.  catalan helps with intergration into the local area and will earn you brownie points. look up ncat - but warning their catalan course is based on you knowing spanish or french.   pm me and i might be able to help you out more"
Barcelona,3calgh,cilmor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:07:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe, as I pointed out that English level was one of the worrying parts of the public system, as your kids already excel in that, you might not notice it. However, from what I have seen, the problem with public schools starts at the Institut level, with a very high lack of motivation and respect, and not being able to properly punish (ie expelling) students, makes some nasty behaviours thrive. This, however, changes from school to school, depending on the neighbourhood you are in.  PS: Oh, and if your kids are being ""brainwashed"" by Minecraft, try getting them into the Redstone aspect of the game, they'll have to use their brain quite a bit (;"
Barcelona,3calgh,kihaku1974,2,Tue Jul 7 03:30:55 2015 UTC,yes - that i would agree with normally. we made sure we picked a school that had a good reputation for their English curriculum and then moved to their catchment zone.   ah our institute has been well researched for those reasons. my oldest has been/will be a target for stupid people so its a concern as was their programme for the sciences and high challenge kids.   yes - my 6 year old is redstoning and my oldest is making her own mods for it - she runs her own server and now a guild on a public server and is a mod on one of the minecraft wikis. she boggles my brain.

Barcelona,3c73e1,DieterBohlen1337,3,Sun Jul 5 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"a) Lack of formal education is not a problem if you can show a protfolio of projects you worked on. b) I know plenty of programmers in Barcelona who don't speak Spanish at all. As you're surely able to communicate, you won't have a problem anywhere. c) All software companies I know are recruiting developers.  Now, the pessimistic side: developer jobs are poorly paid in Spain (relatively to other countries). Even more so in the startup scene and technologies you mentioned.  You might want to consider working remotely for an Austrian company while living here. You can register as autonomo and just invoice them from here quite easily."

Barcelona,3bp71l,jclinares,6,Wed Jul 1 01:08:01 2015 UTC,Skype probably.
Barcelona,3bp71l,babalorisha,3,Wed Jul 1 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"This is what I use for business. I also have a 'skype in' number so people can call me, thinking I'm in London.   Very cheap rates, no long-term contract, works on my phone and my computer, call quality is fine if you're on wifi (better than skype-skype), a bit crap on 3G."
Barcelona,3bp71l,motobrit,2,Wed Jul 1 06:01:38 2015 UTC,"I use 12voip. There are lots of identical services (VOIP), but this one had the best rates, for the countries I call, when I signed up (here is a comparison). You prepay a fixed amount, then you can either call a local number (in Madrid) which then asks you for the number of the party you are calling. I think the set-up charge is €0.039 for each call and then there are the call charges which are very cheap. You can also use their VOIP client and make the call using data; the same charges apply, but if you yourself are roaming and connected to wifi it is very inexpensive. When you top up your account you get 90 days of free calls (plus the set up charge) to many fixed-line numbers around the world. The quality is usually good.  Having said all that, all of the mobile operators have special packs that you can purchase for roaming and overseas calls."

Barcelona,3bp71l,antonia90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:49:46 2015 UTC,I'm looking for something similiar. In Germany we have flat rates for calling European landlines quite cheap since a while (about 4€ extra on your regular landline bill). Is there something like this in Spain or is Skype really the only reasonable option?
Barcelona,3bp71l,mxzr86,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'm from abroad and almost everyone I know lives abroad, plus I have some people like my mother that either can't or won't use skype etc. So far my best option has been www.rebtel.com. You can top up or get packets for a specific country and then call either using WiFi or 3G or your minutes. You can use it from a landline or a mobile phone and call other numbers, without them having the service. I have unlimited minutes with my mobile contract so I only pay whatever I pay to Rebtel, which for me works out to be as low as 0,019€/min. I like it more than Skype because I can call on the go without wasting my 3G and I avoid using the 3G in general which can be a bit patchy. You also get a rebtel number which other people can call at their local rate."
Barcelona,3bnubb,spetsnazcats,3,Tue Jun 30 18:40:40 2015 UTC,no - you have to be part of the lague and there is a restriction on international players - are you registered with the league in your country ? they will be able to see if you can register with the european league and you can work from there.   FC Barcelona ice hockey team came second in the spanish league this year.   afaik there is no pick up games for the lague team but maybe some of the universities have a team - might be worth asking.
Barcelona,3bnubb,kihaku1974,2,Tue Jun 30 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"I doubt that very much. You might, however, be able to play Inline (Roller) Hockey. It is not much more popular, but there are about a dozen teams in Catalonia.  A few of them are located in Barcelona. If you were interested, your hockey gear would be mostly sufficient, you would only need a pair of inline skates and 'hockey pants' known as 'fundes'.   I'm not sure whether you would be able to play in the league since you're here for a short while, but you would certainly be able to train and play in friendly matches.   Skills are mostly transferable.  For any other questions, on local teams, local stores... You can PM me.  Source: Played here for nearly a decade."

Barcelona,3bki4f,motobrit,5,Wed Jul 1 04:56:58 2015 UTC,"Tourists: Most of us here love BCN and probably don't go to the mega-touristy places. So if you're not interested in doing the tourist trail, I wouldn't worry about too many tourists too much. There is loads to see and do here away from the tourists; just avoid the Rambla, the beach at Barceloneta, Gòtico between the cathedral and the Rambla. Or maybe do a bit of tourist stuff just when you feel you can cope with it. The Sagrada Família is worth seeing, tourist hordes notwithstanding. Ditto the fiesta major de Gràcia (not so much tourist hordes as local hordes, but worth it).   Craft beer: There's an absolute explosion here at the moment, and it's mainly locals, so you can enjoy craft beer in relatively non-touristy places  (eg, Chivuo's, La Cervecita  nuestra de cada día, La Més Petita, bunch more here.  Temperature: Yes, it will be hot. Hotels will have air conditioning, so sleeping shouldn't be a problem. It's likely to be in the low thirties and humid, so it's not like Sevilla or Egypt. Have a siesta in the afternoon when it's hottest. People go out late in Barcelona, so you can leave your evenings until after 9pm (or even 10pm) when it's a bit cooler. It's fine (IMO) if you don't have to rush around for work and chores, so take your time and move slow like you would in the tropics."
Barcelona,3bki4f,thebadrash,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:46:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, very helpful :) By tourist trail I mean crowded beaches, discos, the Rambla, loud parties and so on. But anyway I think there are some touristic places which are mandatory (Sagrada Familia for example), maybe buying tickets online as suggested could help.  Are there touristic must-see which are more crowded than others?  I would skip the Rambla but I'm fascinated by the Bouqueria Market: despite touristic, is it worth going?  Craft beer: I know about the explosion, it is the one reason to make me think about coming there. Thanks for the suggestions, I'm yet trembling while wondering what to drink :D  Temperature: mh, so I understand is just like here in (south) Italy."
Barcelona,3bki4f,thebadrash,2,Tue Jun 30 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"So far, it's looking like this will be one of the longest, hottest summers for a few years.

Barcelona,3bki4f,kebuenowilly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was my idea even if I usually prefer another kind of travel.

Anyway it could be a nice new experience (never went to beach on holiday), maybe I could find a not-too-crowded beach. There are some with lockers, isn't it?"

Since I travel with my girlfriend, which zone/quarter would you suggest me to look for an accomodation? I know about pickpockets and micro-criminality, so I would stay where I could drink till late and go to sleep (maybe by feet) without having to act like Cinderella :P Do you think I can still find some good quality/price where-to-sleep now? I've never try to plan a travel so late!  P.S. Please, I do not mean to be offensive about criminality, so forgive me if I hurt you. P.P.S.

But in all seriousness, there is a cemetery on Montjuic (opposite side of the tourist stuff - I've walked there but its a bit of a hike. There is a bus you can take). There are some amazing gravestones, statues, and small versions of chapels/cathedrals. The artwork is incredible, its very serene, and you can visit the graves of some of Barcelona's most notable people. If you go to the office, you can get a map that has a route you can take to see specific graves (there is a historic route and an artistic route). Here is the website - http://www.barcelona.de/en/barcelona-cementery-montjuic.html  Also, this isn't really a secret, but it is fun to go up to Tibidabo. It is like an amusement park that got stuck in 1950. Lots of fun!

It is not a secret, but somehow it is mostly ignored by tourists. I think the ticket also gets you a tour, which is very recommendable. The architecture of the main building is simply amazing.  I live in Barcelona, in fact, I am from that area, and the first time I went to the hospital was last year, and I was shocked. I remember being there when I was a kid, but not as a tourist lol  I also recommend you the tour around Codorniu Caves. You need to go by train, which is like 40 minutes. I think the ticket for the tour is like 10 euros, and it goes for 2-3, and it is really worth it.  If you want a nice coast town, go to Sitges, which is 45minutes away from Barcelona.

But it reminds me of some scam that I saw in Paris: somebody dropped a ""golden"" ring and another person would pick it up and point out how both of you found it. Then they would tell you that it might be worth something and that you can keep it if you give them 50 euros.  If this is something similar, then the wallet might be filled with counterfit money. They might tell you you can keep it if you pay a small amount of real money, and then you're left with a cheap wallet filled with useless paper."

Barcelona,3b2s4r,antonia90,2,Thu Jun 25 14:59:56 2015 UTC,we are doing the kids party and the parade later
Barcelona,3b2s4r,thebadrash,5,Thu Jun 25 15:49:16 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that BCN is a particularly LBGT-friendly city and that expressing homophobic opinions in the street, especially during Pride, will likely meet with opposition and perhaps anger from anyone who overhears you. And not just from /u/kihaku1974. Homophobic abuse is considered a hate crime here.  Freedom of speech has limits on it everywhere and language which can be seen as threatening or discriminatory, especially when based on gender, sexuality or race, should, in my opinion, be proscribed. That said, this is clearly not a point of view which other people share, particularly if they come from a country or school of thought that believes in liberty to offend or threaten as something that ranks higher than liberty to live without threats or hate speech. I prefer a society that moves towards inclusion and equality, and a language which enshrines that spirit."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,desayunosaur,-11,Fri Jun 26 09:10:49 2015 UTC,You sound pretty aggressive about it yourself.
Barcelona,3b2s4r,motobrit,8,Thu Jun 25 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because standing up for equality is the same thing as harassment and abuse, right?"
Barcelona,3b2s4r,desayunosaur,-3,Thu Jun 25 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think you know I wasn't advocating harassment and abuse with what I said. I also think you're being unnecessarily obtuse by saying that in reply.  /u/TheStinger87 says it well below. There's a large difference between saying something, and saying something to a public forum.  There is nobody here who is being dismissive of equality. I'm from Ireland myself, and as you might know, we recently legalised gay marriage there, something the vast majority of the population - including myself - had been looking for for a long time now. We're one of the more backward countries in the EU, I'll readily admit, but we're coming along rapidly as the newer generations grow up and move out into the world.  What we do see there now, though, and perhaps in this comment thread as well, is a lot of people instructing everyone else on what is and what isn't an acceptable opinion to have, and what will and will not be tolerated within their earshot. As if the world at large is supposed to accommodate your earholes and all their sensitivities. There's a world of difference between someone who loudly states ""fags should've been killed at birth"" and someone who is irritated by the actions some might perform in front of their 4 year old should they take them downtown during a gay pride parade. Yourself and OP seem to miss the nuances in those profiles.  For the record, I am neither of those. I'm most likely on the same page as you when it comes to equality and acceptance. I don't, however, appreciate a passive-aggressive broadcast message like OP has made, or be told what opinions on any subject I'm allowed to hold, whether it's in vogue or not."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,motobrit,4,Thu Jun 25 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"I'm most likely on the same page as you when it comes to equality and acceptance   Trust me on this mate, you're likely not, or you wouldn't be worried about ""someone who is irritated by the actions some might perform in front of their 4 year old should they take them downtown during a gay pride parade"". You might think you're right-on and all that, but your prejudice is showing.  Nor would you be concerned about whether your opinion is ""in vogue or not"".   /u/TheStinger87 says it well below   You mean like the bit where he thinks it's cool to say ""stupid fags with their stupid gay parade"" as long as you don't say it to any fags?   Let's try a little thought experiment; I go to the Notting Hill Carnival and say ""stupid n*****s with their stupid black parade"". This is cool, right?  As for this:   As if the world at large is supposed to accommodate your earholes and all their sensitivities   Gimme a break. You poor oppressed heterosexuals, not allowed to express your opinions. Presumably due to all the queers spitting at you in the street, assaulting you, and in some cases killing you because you dared to show that you were heterosexual in public?  If /u/kihaku1974 and I sound aggressive, it's probably because we've been the victims of abuse, violence and discrimination just because of the gender of people we have at some point chosen to have sex with. I certainly have.   The truth is that heterosexuals don't notice the vast majority of prejudice and discrimination against the rest of us because we live in an extremely heteronormative society, and I'm afraid your post is a good demonstration of this. Most of the time, most of us non-heterosexuals keep our heads down and shut the fuck up -- the majority of non-heterosexuals you meet in daily life you will assume are heterosexual, and probably I will too -- and when we don't we're oppressing heterosexuals.  I'm thankful for the fact that we wouldn't even be having this discussion if it was about race."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,TheStinger87,2,Fri Jun 26 08:14:51 2015 UTC,"If someone wanted to disparage black people around black people, but not directly to their face in an aggressive and threatening manner, then they have every right to express their feelings about any situation.  Just because they are wrong and/or stupid doesn't mean they don't have the right to say it.  But free speech does come with the proviso that you must accept that other people have free speech as well and your speech may be challenged by another person.  But the challenge must be equal to the original speech.  If I say something to a friend and you hear it and punch me, you have overstepped the bounds of free speech and gone into assault territory.  That is unacceptable, no matter how much you disagree with what I may have said.  Which brings me to your other point.     You poor oppressed heterosexuals, not allowed to express your opinions. Presumably due to all the queers spitting at you in the street, assaulting you, and in some cases killing you because you dared to show that you were heterosexual in public?   If someone is spitting or assaulting you or, God forbid, killing you then that is so far over the line that the line is a dot to them.  And you have every right to have them arrested and charged for assault.  Free speech means you can say what you want.  What it doesn't mean is that you can physically intimidate someone.  Anyone who does that is a criminal.  But do you see how this works both ways?  Reverse this position and let me challenge your views.  As long as I do it in a peaceful and non-threatening way, it is incumbent upon you to accept that I have the right to my opinion and not react in a hostile manner.  No matter if you feel personally offended or angered by what I have to say.  I have a right to my opinion and if I express my opinion in the correct way, without resorting to violence or intimidation, your response must be equal to that.  Any other response makes you the bigot and makes you the aggressor.  And ultimately does harm to any cause that you may have.  Just remember - this is not your world.  It isn't my world.  It is OUR world.  And we are all different.  And we must be allowed to have our differences.  Whether that be in lifestyle or opinion.  Otherwise this would be a boring place to live."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,motobrit,2,Fri Jun 26 08:41:28 2015 UTC,"I've never advocated violence or intimidation, so your entire post is specious and an attack on a straw man.  People have the right to hold -- and in cases permitted by local laws to express -- stupid opinions, but they shouldn't get all butthurt when someone calls them out on their stupidity.   But more egregiously IMO is that you are trying to sweep aside the issue of equality by solely concentrating on freedom of speech.   In a modern civilised society, equality is an admirable aim, and inequality and discrimination are not. The rights of those striving for equality trump the rights of those striving for inequality."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,TheStinger87,0,Fri Jun 26 10:10:53 2015 UTC,"Nowhere in my argument have I said that equality is not a good thing.  Of course it is.  But I will not sacrifice someone's ability to express an opinion contrary to my own simply because I don't like it.  If I don't like it, I will counter with an argument of my own which hopefully lead them to see the folly of their ways.    They may be idiots, but I will fight to the death for them to be allowed to be idiots, so long as they don't hurt anyone.  Equality is a two way street my friend.

Barcelona,3b2s4r,motobrit,5,Thu Jun 25 15:48:27 2015 UTC,"I am as tolerant as the next guy, but you are kind of being a douche about this.  You can shout ""Gays are great"" but having the opposite opinion is not allowed and is harassment?    Let's be clear, I am not advocating chasing after people and badgering them within an inch of their life.  That is not free speech - that is blatant harassment.  But having a different opinion is still allowed last time I checked.  If I saw someone in the street yelling at a homosexual couple, I would be the first to tell them to cut it out and leave them alone.  But, by the same token, if two people say to each other ""stupid fags with their stupid gay parade"" and someone started verbally attacking them for having an opinion, I would also be the first to step in and tell them to cut it out and leave them alone.  You can still have an opinion.  Whether everyone agrees with it, that is not my concern.  But as long as you are not hurting anyone else and not shouting at them and making them feel intimidated, you can say whatever you like.  Someone wants to say something stupid - let them.  And walk away thinking about how stupid they are.  But attacking them makes you no better than they are."

You can absolutely say ""faggots like you should have been killed at birth"" - amongst your friends.  And if it is a public forum, then it may get heard by other people, but it is essentially a private conversation between friends.  You have a right to say whatever you want to each other.  What you can't do is be ""verbally abusive and harassing.""  So, if you went and yelled that same thing in someone's face, then you have stepped way over the line and you should  be held accountable for that action.  But it goes both ways.  If I say something to a friend and you happen to overhear it, you cannot come over to me and yell in my face about how insensitive or discriminatory I am.  If you do that, then you are no better than the guy who yells homophobic things in someone's face.  But a lot of people don't understand that."

It means you have lost control of your emotions and have escalated the situation into a confrontation and a possible physical altercation.

As long as you aren't physically intimidating someone.  If you don't agree with this, then I don't want you anywhere near me, because you are a violent, intellectual bigot."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,ylcard,5,Sat Jun 27 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Conversations between a group directed only within the group is none of my business.  The minute though it gets directed towards someone outside the group, that makes it in the public domain."
Barcelona,3b2s4r,ylcard,2,Thu Jun 25 18:49:34 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Than it seems we have reached a settlement.  Would you like a coffee?  Or should we go our separate ways?

You just need to make a distinction between expressing opinions and abusing people, they're not the same thing. So you can't tell anyone to keep their opinions to themselves, unless Barcelona is now a city where your opinion must undergo a censorship committee."

Feel free to be very vocal about your opinions but in public, you are not free from the consequences of the effect of those opinions.  Just dont harass gay people in a city where they have equal rights, just because they dont have equal rights in your home town.   I just refuse to allow someone to be harasses by tourists who spout bigoted crap thinking locals wont understand them."

When finished it will weigh some 227,000 tonnes and measure 362 metres (1,187 feet) in length, 50 metres longer than the height of the Eiffel Tower.  Harmony is also a metre wider than the current twin ocean-going monsters of the pleasure cruise world, which are also 362 metres long.  ""Allure of the Seas"" and ""Oasis of the Seas"", the world's biggest cruise ships in current service, are 65 metres wide and come in at 225,000 tonnes a piece. All three belong to Royal Caribbean International cruise lines.  Some 2,500 people are at work building Harmony, which will require 90,000 square metres (968,700 square feet) of carpet and 500,000 litres (132,000 gallons) of paint.  The test runs of the boat are presently set for mid-February 2016 and its first voyage is planned for May next year, a trip from Southampton in Britain to the Spanish city of Barcelona.  The ship will have room for some 6,360 passengers and 2,100 staff members."

Probably a smart move.   She has already stopped evictions since she took office and has said it is her top priority, threatening to levy big fines on banks that sit on empty properties as a means to pressure them.   There was no big fuck-you to tourists, neither in the campaign nor now. She is (rightly) wanting to crack down on illegal tourist flats and control the rate at which hotels are being built. She did decide this week not to bid for the 2026 Olympic games, as it's not a priority for the city.   To say that she won the election isn't exactly true. She won enough votes to allow her to cobble together a coalition of leftist parties and kick out the status quo (who have plenty of problems of their own right now)."
Barcelona,3aqr35,alaninsitges,2,Mon Jun 22 21:18:38 2015 UTC,illegal tourist flats   is that airbnb or are those declared / taxed?
Barcelona,3aqr35,motobrit,3,Mon Jun 22 21:32:52 2015 UTC,"It's down to the flat owner.   If they're letting out the whole flat, they should have a tourist licence (I don't know about renting a room). Tourist licences are essentially impossible to get now in Barcelona.   And yes, the owner is supposed to pay tax on the profits.   You can pretty much guarantee that the vast majority of airbnb flats are not legal.   Also worth pointing out that the previous administration was already cracking down on illegal tourist flats. Tourist licences were suspended in May 2014.  A friend of mine was renting a tourist flat in BCNeta (from a proper agency, it had a tourist licence) in September 2014 and got a visit from some police aggressively demanding she show them the licence (which of course she didn't have: the owner has that, not the guest). They led her to believe that if she couldn't produce it when they returned she they would force her leave the apartment (not true, of course). She was understandably upset by the experience.   Of course, they could have looked the address up on the Gencat.cat website but it's much more fun to scare the crap out of a young woman staying alone in a strange city with a couple of armed goons knocking on the door.   The Catalunya-wide law currently says that you must include your HUT (tourist licence) number in every ad for a tourist rental. Of course, nobody does this. Whether that's due to ignorance or not having a tourist licence, who can say.  Another fun detail of the tourist licence system: You have to take a copy of every guest's passport and lodge it with the Guardia Civil. ¡Arriba España!"

She still wants to take back things like the Formula 1 grand prix and has backed off for the moment the Winter Olympic games stance for 2026, all of this for 'reasons' and 'the poor poor people'.  It should be noted that the evictions she made the spectacle of stopping as a mayor were already stopped by the previous mayor. She also has support of a part of the population, not everyone by far whatsoever. People are also afraid of many vengeance style policies she might enact, like to the 'oppressing' police of her past.  Her future is probably short-sighted. Protesting is very easy, governing is not, and by past experiences the people with this kind of ideology tend to be poor administrators and are also very tied to their exaggerated promises before the elections they can no longer fulfill afterwards.

Barcelona,3aibzw,LatzeH,10,Sat Jun 20 13:38:19 2015 UTC,There's another thread from today about snorkeling with some suggestions.  DON'T MAKE ANY KIND OF FIRE. YOU'LL GO TO PRISON AND I'LL GO THERE FOR WHEN YOUR SOAP FALLS.  You're right about wild camping: totally prohibited. You may want to find a proper camping or sleep without a tent.
Barcelona,3aibzw,maxgregor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw that thread after I had posted this. Would a mini stove really not be legal? When you say wild camping is totally prohibited, are you referring to wild camping on beaces? Because I have a lot of sources saying that wild camping is allowed in Catalona. Also, are you saying that it's legal to sleep on the beach if we don't put up a tent?"
Barcelona,3aibzw,nckt,4,Sat Jun 20 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"I've wild camped in a lot of different places in Spain, including here on Montserrat (the shock, the horror). I'm not even 100% sure it's allowed (outside National Parks), but we definitely did it and as always in any country I followed a really easy set of rules:   Don't be a dick - don't make it OBVIOUS you're camping where you are, camp away from the main trail and make sure you leave the spot exactly as you found it, this includes not making a fire. Don't use your camp (read: sleeping) spot for anything other than to camp (sleep). If you want to sit around and have beers, play music or whatever, then cool, do that somewhere that isn't where you want to sleep. If you sit on a beach til 4am drinking and talking (with no fire) nobody will care. Then walk to your spot, sleep and it's all good. Don't. Be. A. Dick - When you're setting up your stove, do it on a rock and be extra vigilant to  make sure that it doesn't fall over. As in - stay sat there with your hands on it and don't leave it NO FIRES - NONE.   Wild camping is not allowed in National Park areas. As for the rest of it - it comes down to you and the land owner to dispute it. If you're respectful and nobody knows you're there, then you won't have a problem with the latter.I usually go to sleep late and leave early. I've done this in all manner of countries where wild camping is strictly prohibited, even in the Alps where people say they have been heavily fined every time. Usually those people turn up and use it as a camping site, which is evidently is not.  tl;dr: don't be a dick. be respectful and leave everything as it was and you won't have a problem."
Barcelona,3aibzw,Sugusino,4,Sun Jun 21 06:42:03 2015 UTC,You can't make fire anywhere without a permit. Not even a stove. Same goes for sleeping.

I remember a friend basically running back to civilisation in the middle of the night and later seeing her with a lot, a lot of bites.   There are many, many places in the world where you can go wild camping. Costa Brava in summer is not one of them.

Barcelona,3aibzw,escapingtraveller,-5,Tue Jun 23 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"As far as firemaking goes, if you're careful and not too obvious you shouldnt have any problems. And usually if the police catch you and you're not beligerent they'll just ask you to put it out.   Camping is easier, as in most of Spain you can sleep anywhere if you're on a route or journey. You're just supposed to set up the tent around sundown and dismantle it around sunrise. And again, if the police catch you they'll ask that you put it away.   Results may vary though, for all I know you could end up with a huge fine. This is just what I've always done."
Barcelona,3aibzw,thebadrash,3,Sun Jun 21 07:19:02 2015 UTC,Hahahahaha have you actually done that? I think not. I once got caught with a stove and the shitstorm was pretty big.   And we told the gc that we were desperate because we got lost and he let us go without a fine.

I couldn't recommend these guys enough. It was €80 a person for the open water dive which i highly recommend. If it want pictures is €100 for an extra instructor to take pictures and it's also €30 per person to have your instructor come personally pick you up and take you to the center. You'll go to the center and your instructor will briefly go over your equipment. Once you feel comfortable you'll suit up and do a practice dive in the pool and then you'll be on your way to the marina. I highly recommend taking your camera with you on the boat. The marina is one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Anyway, I'm starting to ramble. If it babe any other questions please don't hesitate to ask. Also, if you're interested I believe they do a 4 day certification course. I think it's a little over €300 but they own their own apartments that you can stay at with no extra cost and you get the added benefit of having your certification that let's you drive anywhere in the world"
Barcelona,3agi3w,jpwasson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:21:18 2015 UTC,"That's great, I'll definitely check them out.

I understand we're not qualified so I'm not expecting to be doing anything ridiculous, just want to make sure I can get the best experience. Thanks!"
Barcelona,3agi3w,jpwasson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:56:01 2015 UTC,"I was apprehensive myself but there really is no need to be. They are great! We were in the pool for about ten minutes, just to give us enough time to get used to the breathing. After we were comfortable we loaded everything up and went out to the sea. We went down 18 meters in depth and we were under water for close to 40 minutes, however that time can vary depending on how fast you consume your air. They fill your tank up to a certain pressure and one you hit the right spot on the gauge then you ascend back to the service. So if you want to stay down as long as possible is definitely a good idea to make sure you breathe very calmly but never home your breath. I should also say the Mediterranean isn't teeming with life like a coral would be. With that being said, we did see some eel, an octopus, fish, and quite a few jelly fish. Also, please pay the extra €100 for the photographs. We had another instructor follow us around with a GoPro the whole time."

In the three months I was there I felt I couldn't touch anything in the house. They'd constantly go through my things. Their life is so routine I thought I was in an asylum. Monday - pork chops and cheese for dinner. Watched some tv program. Tuesdays was soup and board games. Wednesdays we had hotdogs. We went for a walk. Ect. Also the parents didn't speak any English and the two sons hated me. So literally no one spoke to me. The host mom would only answer my question if my question had perfect grammar (in Spanish).  The secon family actually kept me for two terms. They were absoultly lovely people. They had two daughters, one was practically fluent I english. The mom too. I felt absoultly at home there and I'm actually sad to be leaving them. I felt like I was adopted it was nice.

Barcelona,3aejc8,TraceAmerican,10,Fri Jun 19 14:00:59 2015 UTC,"I love living in Eixample, I'm originally from the UK, here's some pros and cons  Pros   You're in the middle of everything, generally if you want something you can walk to it, restaurants, markets, shops, bars etc.  Good connections, metro and bus, although I generally walk everywhere Walking to work for me is amazing, having come from London where my commute was 1hr15 across town the difference it makes to my life is enormous.   Cons   Depending on the road there's a lot of traffic, I live on Aragon and the noise is pretty high, we have a flat that goes all the way through the block though and the rooms and terrace at the back are quiet. Tourists, I actually don't see too many but if you're more towards Passeig de Gràcia then it might be more of an issue Constant partying, again I don't see much of that either..."

Barcelona,3aejc8,bas-bas,7,Fri Jun 19 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"To me, l'Eixample is the best area in Barcelona. It is located in the center of the city, it is well connected with public transport, it is safe and you have access to all kinds of services. Perhaps Americans do not like it because it is very different to their ideal location in an American city: It is very densely populated, not car-friendly and expensive.  Sarrià - Sant Gervasi is one of the most expensive areas in Barcelona. Obviously it is also a very good place to live but it is not as centric and well-connected as l'Eixample.   Most people that choose to live in Gràcia do so because of its lively atmosphere and activity. It is a really nice place, but if you are not interested in that, you have other options."

Barcelona,3aejc8,strawberry23,3,Fri Jun 19 17:22:41 2015 UTC,"I just see people complaining here that it is constantly out-of-control   I don't recall anyone saying that since I've been on this sub.  I'm living in Vila de Gracia at the moment (Fraternitat) and it's not out of control at all. I wouldn't live on one of the plaças though: too noisy.  And I plan to be out of Gràcia before the Festa major de Gràcia. It will be mental in this street for a week. I did it last year and it was fun, but once was enough.   Bear in mind that Eixample is huge, so has a lot of different areas, each with slightly different characters.   Personally, if I was living in Eixample, I'd like to live near Girona or Verdaguer metros. Near enough to everything, decent shops and supermarkets, attractive buildings and flats."

I'll check out Vila de Gracia then, it's really close to my office and honestly I'd rather live somewhere fun. I've lived in major American cities for the past 7 years of my life so I think I can handle some noise. As long as there isn't a festival. Thank you for the advice, much appreciated."
Barcelona,3aejc8,PiRX_lv,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:44:45 2015 UTC,"I am from Chicago and lived in Vila de Gracia for just over a year and loved it. If I were to move back, I'd either live in Gracia or El Born. L'Eixample is nice too... it just lacks character for my liking. Gracia and El Born both have old buildings, small, hidden cafes, etc. They're very charming. As /u/motobrit said, just don't live on a plaza. They're super rowdy until ~4am most weekends and loud on some weeknights too."
Barcelona,3aejc8,johansnow,3,Wed Jun 24 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"There is a fine line between considering it a ""lively atmosphere"" and ""constantly out-of control"" that depends on the character of each person. To me most streets in Gràcia are perfectly OK. For a foreigner, residing in some particular streets in August may be unbearable.  And the best neighborhood is Vila de Gràcia, the rest of the district is not that interesting and more hilly and not so well-communicated."

Barcelona,3ae9sc,liftlikeacollegegirl,3,Fri Jun 19 12:26:43 2015 UTC,OK. That particular neighborhood isn't a super nice place. I wouldn't say it's dangerous or even a bad place but it's far from the first place I'd recommend a newcomer to stay in. It's sort of a run-down barrio with all the problems that come with low investment and so on.    Esplugues itself has some nice parts. And the metro will get you into the city really conveniently. Do you mind if I ask why did you choose this neighborhood? Because it's cheap? Did you get a decent place at least?

Barcelona,3a0qz8,fedezen,6,Tue Jun 16 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems that if its not red meat it is a vegetable, like chicken."
Barcelona,3a0qz8,viktorbir,2,Tue Jun 16 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"Well, in fact vegetarians don't eat only vegetables, you know? Of course, not the flesh of dead animals, but milk and eggs are ok."

Barcelona,3a0qz8,isthisoneworking,2,Tue Jun 16 10:59:46 2015 UTC,Gopal and Vegetariana at placa tripi are nice. In general you find some good vegetarian options in most places in the born/raval/gotico area. For vegan food i'd go to the two mentioned above or maybe cat bar if you're looking for a bar food option. In raval you can also find a Vegetariana at joanquin costa and next to macba you have vegie garden and biocenter. then there is also juicy jones on top of rambla de raval.  these are just some places that came up in my head but as said before just walk around the old part of town with open eyes and you'll defenetly find something. I never have problems finding some vegetarian food here

I've gotten ideas from things on google and reddit already, such as this and this. I posted here because I was hoping that some locals would have ideas that might not be so readily apparent on the internet, and also to see if there is a chance someone would like to meet up.

I'd have to look more at a map to tell you what specifically is close to you but some off the bat recommendations:  Conesa They do great gluten free sandwiches. Definitely stop by this place at least once. Right in the heart of the old city in Plaça St. Jaume.  Viena Also great sandwiches. If you go here get the Iberico sin gluten. It's just a simple ham sandwich with tomate on gluten free bread, but this ham isn't your boring, bologna sandwich in 3rd grade. This ham is on a whole nother level. Some dude at the NYTimes wrote about the place here. It might feel sort of fast food ish but I promise it's fucking great.  For a nicer dinner sort of deal check out Pepa Tomate. It has a lot of more traditional Catalan dishes as well as just an overall great selection.   Those were honestly my 3 favorite places to eat when I was in BCN. I just looked up where you're staying and it's not really near any of them but if you're going to be exploring the city anyways those are in areas with a lot of stuff to be visiting and seeing. I'm also celiac and lived in BCN for about 4 months so if you wife has other questions about phrases or anything feel free to send a message.  Edit: Just remembered that there are European style crepes (made with Buckwheat so gluten free) in the big market you'll almost certainly go to called La Boqueria as well as on the other side of Plaça Catalunya. Check that out here."

You can buy frozen ones (that you have to pan fry) at Chinese supermarkets, the best is Dong Feng in c/Balmes, just behind FNAC. They have a dozen different kinds and they all taste like fermented bongwater.   If you want good gyoza, go to Chen Ji in c/Ali Bei and get them to go.

I have more recommendations if you'd like!  As for pintxos, it depends. A lot of them are served on bread with toothpicks and they count the number of toothpicks to determine how much you pay at the end of the meal. But I've They actually originate from Basque Country but there are still good places to eat pintxos in Barcelona. Pintxos usually come in a single portion, so you can go to a pintxo place by yourself.  El Born district has many tapas and pintxos places, would be worth a try! I just visited Sagardi ( for pintxos) yesterday and it was pretty delicious and photo-worthy to boot. I also like El Xampanyet and Bormuth for tapas.

Barcelona,39fef3,emmanlop,3,Thu Jun 11 10:28:56 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to think on the credits and if they are going to be validated once you go back. Anything is easier if you study enough, but from what I heard, that particular school at UPF is kind of good, so you'll have to study either way. You can read more here: http://www.upf.edu/facecon/es/estudis/graus/grau-economia/presentacio/  Many foreign students do like to travel, it will depend on your money and time, if you have plenty of money then yes you can travel, you'll find lots of cheap flights but spending a weekend in Paris or London might cost more than you think, so have that in mind, it's possible and easier if a group of friends go together.  In my experience, young students nowadays feel entitled to good grades and tend to have an attitude even when they know that they did not make and effort. Don't expect special treatment, if you are not working on an interesting phd project you are just another annoying kid. Please don't be one of those kind of students.  Other tips, well, this stupid american kid planned to study a master at UPF and thought that his passport was like a multipass, he never did the paperwork to stay legally for his studies, so he went back home for the holidays and then when he wanted to come back to Barcelona, they found out he was living illegally and the customs office doesn't take that very kindly. Have all your papers in order, take the time to have everything in order, this will help you to travel with confidence.

I will definitely NOT be an annoying, self-entitled brat. Mama raised a good son :p haha"
Barcelona,39fef3,nd235,2,Thu Jun 11 11:41:45 2015 UTC,"Well, then you are all set up!   You'll have enough time to travel in Spain, check out vueling for cheap flights or take the train, also the south of France is really beautiful on those dates, consider going to Avignon, Orange, Nîmes or Marseille, they might not be ""Paris"" but are really beautiful places to go."
Barcelona,39fef3,Sugusino,2,Thu Jun 11 12:47:58 2015 UTC,"As a young student, we are not entitled to a good grade, lol. Not with courses that fail 75% of the participants sometimes. I take my 50%, pat myself in the back for a job well done and that's it."

Barcelona,39fipl,antonia90,2,Thu Jun 11 11:42:18 2015 UTC,enting alo   Hi Thanks for the link and info. This will make it much easier. my overall budget will be about 2300 euros a month. I was thinking about 600-700 euros for renting alone plus bills.
Barcelona,39fipl,antonia90,2,Thu Jun 11 11:45:17 2015 UTC,Might be a bit tight for renting alone in Gracia. If you shared with one person possibly doable.
Barcelona,39fipl,antonia90,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:52:10 2015 UTC,When I look on idealista it seems that I can afford this but I am probably not reading this right. Would this be sharing? I look into this further but good to know what I can actually get for my budget.
Barcelona,39fipl,antonia90,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:05:10 2015 UTC,Can you post one you've found as an example?
Barcelona,39fipl,Sugusino,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:38:32 2015 UTC,http://www.fotocasa.es/en/home/barcelona-capital/lift-furnished-mare-de-deu-del-coll-114-135407461?opi=140&tti=3&ppi=3&pagination=1&RowGrid=1&tta=1  This looks far to good for this price. I must be missing something.
Barcelona,39fipl,aenemic,4,Thu Jun 11 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm... To me that's not crazy cheap actually. The neighbourhood is in the district of Gracia, but this bit is quite outside the centre of the city.  By Gracia I supposed the area below the Travessera de Dalt, which is quite a nice neighbourhood to live in and thus quite expensive. It depends on how long you're willing to commute, how nice is the neighbourhood itself, etc. Just to give you an indication: We're paying 800EUR for a 2-bedroom apartment, 80m2, near Plaça de Sants."
Barcelona,39fipl,motobrit,2,Thu Jun 11 13:08:32 2015 UTC,Oh I see. My geography is a bit off. I was looking for places near Park Guell or Parc Del Guinardo. Do you know much about these areas?
Barcelona,39fipl,enzo-the-dog,3,Thu Jun 11 13:16:46 2015 UTC,"Depending on the side of Park Güell, there's areas that are incredibly cheap. Like Ctra del Carmel which is a bit shady."
Barcelona,39fipl,OtterSpaceship,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"People keep saying its shady, Ive lived here for a year now, and I dont see it. People are nice, there are has two amazing parks right around the corner and stuffs generally cheaper."
Barcelona,39fipl,enzo-the-dog,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:13:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd suggest not fixating on Gracia. For one thing, anything you've heard about Gracia will be about Vila de Gracia, not out near Park Guell.   Personally, I think that around Verdaguer is much more liveable (decent supermarkets, nicer buildings, better flats) and if you want to go hang out in Gracia, it's a 10 minute walk away at most.  For some reason Gracia has a really good reputation amongst guiris which I'm not sure it deserves. I'm currently living slap-bang in the middle of Vila de Gracia so I know what I'm talking about."
Barcelona,39fipl,enzo-the-dog,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:24:30 2015 UTC,Cheers. You're right.  I haven't actually given any other areas a proper look. I was more focused on price and distance from work. I will broaden my search.
Barcelona,39fipl,enzo-the-dog,2,Fri Jun 12 08:17:17 2015 UTC,"Chiming in here; That's Barcelona for you. It's a bit far out maybe, but otherwise I don't see anything wrong with it."
Barcelona,39fipl,enzo-the-dog,2,Thu Jun 11 13:06:57 2015 UTC,I had a gf living there: get ready to climb some mountains.
Barcelona,39fipl,OtterSpaceship,3,Thu Jun 11 15:30:18 2015 UTC,"You are reading this right. 600-700 can get you an apartment in Gracia - but you'll probably have an easier time if you up the budget a bit. That said, a quick search showed a few nice places, like this or this. If you rent from a 'particular' (it will say so on idealista, fotocasa and others) you save yourself the agency fee which is usually either 1 month or 10% of annual rent. Deposits are usually 1-2 months.  If you have any specific questions let me know, we relocated here 2 years ago ;)"
Barcelona,39fipl,antonia90,3,Thu Jun 11 12:41:03 2015 UTC,Do you think 2K+ will be enough to rent alone and live comfortably? Did you move to Gracia?
Barcelona,39fipl,Sugusino,2,Thu Jun 11 12:46:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. Say you go with one of the apartments I linked - that's 700 in rent. You are one person and the apartments aren't huge - add maybe another 100-150 for utilities - so maybe you're at 850 now. Food is really cheap here - I think 300 for one person should be enough. You are now just short of 1200 and have another 1.1k left for everything else. I'm not sure how much taxes would be for you, but on 2k they won't be all that much. A couple hundred. You'll be fine.  And no, I lived in Sant Antoni, Guinardo and now Dreta de l'Eixample (at the opposite end of Gracia, above El Born). But I only ever heard good things about Gracia.  If you don't mind me asking; where would you work? Maybe there are other good barrios for you that you haven't considered."
Barcelona,39fipl,Sugusino,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:58:19 2015 UTC,The budget I mentioned would be after tax. I will be located near verdaguer metro. I was looking for places that are a walking distance of around 40 minutes max. I was looking at place near Park Guell or Parc Del Guinardo. Do you think it would be better to live elsewhere?
Barcelona,39fipl,kihaku1974,2,Thu Jun 11 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"If it's after tax you can probably up your rent budget to 1k if you wanted to and still live comfortably :) You won't have any problems with that amount.  If you are close to Verdaguer I'd consider the nicer areas of gracia or the upper parts of Dreta de l'Eixample. I think Plaça Tetuan and up might be a good fit for you. Depends a bit on what style you like more. Gracia is a bit hipster bohemian (very generalized) and dreta de l'eixample is more like old proud city buildings. (I can send you some pictures of our new place in a PM, if you want to see what I mean by 'old proud' - not sure how to describe it properly, but it's a very typical look for this area)  I lived right by Parc del Guinardo until recently in a newly built small apartment block but it's just too far out for me. I walked 30 mins to our office each day - it's okay, but the way back is up the hill and it gets pretty damn hot and humid in Barcelona."
Barcelona,39fipl,kihaku1974,0,Thu Jun 11 13:29:07 2015 UTC,I suppose I am going to have to do a lot more research before I rent. I was only looking at Garcia because of what I'd heard. Do you think it is worth staying in a hotel for a few days and to visit the apartments? If you wouldn't mind sending me the photos I can have a look?

Barcelona,39gqri,Ohiofox,2,Thu Jun 11 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"Well you're right next to Plaça Catalunya, which means you're close to the center, which means you're close to a ton of bars. If you go down Via Laietana towards the port you'll be headed to Barri Gótic and Born, both good places for bars. I can't suggest a good bar for you because I don't know what you're looking for.   You'll be there when Sónar is going on, so there will be a ton of Off Sónar parties to attend. So in my opinion, I'd probably forgo the bar scene mostly and be at those parties or Sónar."

Barcelona,39a2zq,antonia90,8,Wed Jun 10 09:57:27 2015 UTC,actually most of that i agree with. especially the part about having kids speaking catalan will open far more doors...  except the obstacles part - i´ve yet to experience anyone who has given me a hard time over struggling with the language - maybe its because i apologise first for not having any decent language skills.
Barcelona,39a2zq,kihaku1974,7,Wed Jun 10 10:51:01 2015 UTC,"I've been given a hard time about the language, quite often actually, when I was living in Girona. Every week or so someone would ask ""how is my catalan going"" and this was by people whose job is supposed to be very internationally-oriented. It's amazing how much more confident I feel trying to speak after I moved here and people seemed much less judgemental and just happy to see a foreigner trying."
Barcelona,39a2zq,aenemic,5,Wed Jun 10 11:00:26 2015 UTC,Free English - Catalan classes would help a lot I imagine. I would jump on it at least.
Barcelona,39a2zq,kihaku1974,4,Wed Jun 10 10:53:23 2015 UTC,I have and do. but i struggle due to a variety of reasons.   but the Ncat classes are not english to Catalan they are Spanish to Catalan - and if you dont have spanish (or french) then Catalan is a new world of hurt.
Barcelona,39a2zq,aenemic,6,Wed Jun 10 11:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Spanish - Catalan when not proficient at any of them seems like quite the challenge, its why I havent gotten to those classes yet. If they had the same offer but directly from English I imagine immigrants would be more willing to learn Catalan first."
Barcelona,39a2zq,rogerology,3,Wed Jun 10 11:43:28 2015 UTC,"Would it be of interest to maybe get together a group of people from here wanting to learn catalan and organise a class all together with a teacher? It would probably be cheaper than individual classes, though I'm not sure how it would work with the different levels. Just an idea..."
Barcelona,39a2zq,Ruuh,3,Wed Jun 10 12:33:51 2015 UTC,I can help: I'm trilingual. If there's any real interest we could sort something out.
Barcelona,39a2zq,aenemic,3,Wed Jun 10 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd be up for an organised class, but I can say a definite yes to practicing speaking/listening Catalan. I've been learning it for a year now, and the biggest help has probably been teaching English to two ex-neighbours. We meet weekly, and they still don't really speak the language, so everything has to be done in Catalan, which has helped me more than them, I'd wager. (It's really more like a weekly chat than anything else.)  Then again, the local library has Catalan speaking groups, but I have no idea what's going on in them, and I've been too shy to actually sit in and/or try to get something from the organizer with my halting Catalan (and no Spanish)."
Barcelona,39a2zq,kihaku1974,2,Wed Jun 10 15:22:30 2015 UTC,If I could afford anything these days that would be a good idea. Unemployment and no paro means money is tight.
Barcelona,39a2zq,aenemic,3,Wed Jun 10 16:33:42 2015 UTC,yes. its very hard to find classes for english to catalan. lots of english to spanish.   also english natives do not have the physical ability to make some of the sounds in spanish/catalan - the same for asian people trying english. my oldest was given speech therapy in school to help her be able to form the sounds correctly.

Barcelona,395lgc,kihaku1974,3,Tue Jun 9 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"You are facing a twohand problem here.  First, in 2013 (Sept to December), your partner was not fiscally resident in Spain yet. Therefore he should not have paid any taxe sin Spain, solely a Tax should had been witheld (10%) according to the Tax Treaty to avoid a double Taxation between Spain and England.  The other problem is that it is not clear what was paid.  If you paid taxes, you have to proceed one way. If money was withheld, you have to proceed in a different way.  You actially paid Income Tax: You (or your tad advisor) will have to prepare a writing claiming that taxes were incorrectly paid. Your partner was not a fiscal resident in Spain and therefore should not have paid any taxe sin Spain, solely the money should had ben withheld. As your partner had to pay taxes in the UK that year, you have to present the income taxes he paid there, that includes the Spanish income.  You should request a refund for the money paid. There are some details and special conditions that have to be taken into account, make sure your tax advisor is considering everything.  The money was withheld: Then you will have to ask for the refund to the Spanish IRS via the UK IRS. I know it´s a pain, but unfortunately it´s how it works. You will have to ask in the UK that they get your refund back from the Spanish Tax Administation via a new portal they did, IIRC in 2012 (online application for tax refund). But in the UK they might have it different. Brace yourself, a client of mine got their money back after a full year...  Finally, either way, if he only earned 13.000 the whole year, he should not have filled out the Income Tax Statement at all, unless he had a previous job that year. 3.800 over 13.000 represents a 29,2%. Which makes absolutely no sense. The only way this should be so high is if he had a job as a company manager, because then the withholding tax is automatically 42% (more or less, talking from memory here).   Well, anyways, good luck and if you want me to look over anything just let me know."

Barcelona,38xkwa,TheUtomjording,2,Sun Jun 7 19:33:35 2015 UTC,I think the best way to buy it in advance would be on Barça's own website.  And there are plenty of places to watch around here.   I just don't know if Barça will be playing as I don't watch football and you can visita /r/barca for more info on this.

Barcelona,38uxdu,babalorisha,3,Sun Jun 7 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going out on a limb here, but you might want to look into even older buildings. Big parts of l'Eixample, for example, were built during 1850 and 1930, and I would wager that the quality and work put into those buildings was higher than many 70s and 80s blocks. Plus, they tend to look much nicer, if the upkeep is decent. I've lived in three different blocks, two old and one newer, and the difference was substantial. Another reason for this difference, however, might be the lower apartment density of the older ones. Many older buildings have fewer apartments per floor, so you have fewer potentially annoying neighbours.   Maybe someone can give you real advice, but at least, in my experience, it has been so."
Barcelona,38uxdu,ArturGM,3,Sun Jun 7 07:51:12 2015 UTC,I agree. Lived in a block built in the early 2000s. I could hear very clearly what the person next door was doing. The financial crisis has forced developers to do more with less... so even if the building was meant to be a high quality build I'm sure you'll find they stripped back to the basics in order to complete. I now live in a building built in the 1860s and the noise is very much reduced..... and there are two apartments per floor 😊 I just have to fix those annoying water leaks and I'm set!
Barcelona,38uxdu,Lilygobang,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:53:53 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Thanks, you two!  One question: do these buildings have lifts?"
Barcelona,38uxdu,ArturGM,2,Sun Jun 7 10:33:32 2015 UTC,"The ones I have lived in and visited, all had lifts. I would not doubt there to be some without, however."
Barcelona,38uxdu,Lilygobang,2,Sun Jun 7 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"So sorry for not replying! My building is an odd one. It was owned by one person for about 50 years. They put a lift in just for them! From the shop to their top floor apartment. So yes, there is one. No-one uses it :) I have been told any building with more than five floors has to have one. Not sure how true that is or even if it were, how many buildings have had them put in."

Barcelona,38s0xt,Parareda8,2,Sat Jun 6 18:06:55 2015 UTC,There has been wifi in some beaches like forum for a long long time. Barcelona beaches are still really shitty so no amount of free wifi will change my mind.

I am sure the F1 alone brings more than 4m into the city in the week it is here."

Barcelona,38s185,viktorbir,4,Sat Jun 6 11:33:20 2015 UTC,"Actually I should change what I wrote. I think the state should obviously fund community facilities for sports. But things like F1 and FCB are private companies and that's where I draw the line. In my town, the ajuntament spent millions upgrading the local club's football ground to help it get into a higher division. Of course, I can't just go there at the weekend and have a kick around. But the facilities that are available to the public are falling apart. It's that kind of thing that irritates me. And I've now said enough on the matter!!!"

Barcelona,38s185,kihaku1974,2,Mon Jun 8 07:43:33 2015 UTC,You basically explained neo liberal politics/economics from a personal experience.
Barcelona,38s185,aenemic,2,Tue Jun 9 13:44:10 2015 UTC,Yep! And it's the PSC who did it. Scum.
Barcelona,38s185,thebadrash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:09:01 2015 UTC,Any old big party in Europe tows the neo liberal line. None have come out against TISA/TTIP/Corporate Fascism. They can all dissolve and metaphorically die for all I care.
Barcelona,38s185,aenemic,2,Tue Jun 9 16:29:16 2015 UTC,Then they should be able to host it themselves dont you think?  What she said was that it was stupid to spend that money on F1 when there are hungry people that needs attention. Something I wholeheartedly agree with.
Barcelona,38s185,aenemic,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:43:04 2015 UTC,Agreed.  But she needs to word it better. I know some of the people in the F1 industry in barcelona and they are a bit peeved about how she is going about this given madrid has just leved a huge dose of new fees on service providers. The F1 management should lose any grants etc but not to impact the service providers.
Barcelona,38s185,kihaku1974,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure its the newspaper that should word itself better, instead of being sensationalistic, although that of course does not sell as many papers. The only quote from her there is what I said: ""Is the priority guaranteeing school meal grants with €4.5 million or spending four million on Formula One?"" Colau said.   The answer to that question should be very easy to answer for anyone with a concience.   F1s corporate sponsors and owners, who make far more than the city does on these events should shell out that money themselves."
Barcelona,38s185,aenemic,2,Tue Jun 9 19:09:06 2015 UTC,Agreed
Barcelona,38s185,kihaku1974,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"No, it's just F1. She's not going to shut Montmeló down and the absence of an F1 race, if it happened, wouldn't stop motoGP or the others.  Personally, I don't think the government should spend any money whatsoever on sports, and that includes Barça. All these organizations: UEFA, FIFA, F1, IOC etc are corrupt parasites feeding off public funds and paying no taxes."
Barcelona,38s185,thebadrash,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:47:31 2015 UTC,Part 1 - Good to know Part 2 - agree about they should be made to pay vat

Barcelona,38s185,thebadrash,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:57:10 2015 UTC,Very true.
Barcelona,38s185,kihaku1974,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"""Is the priority guaranteeing school meal grants with €4.5 million or spending four million on Formula One?"" Colau said.   As far as I know, everybody asking for a school meal grant in Barcelona has got it."
Barcelona,38s185,viktorbir,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:35:06 2015 UTC,I think so.  Our school increased the salary amount as they had extra funding so more kids could get it.
Barcelona,38s185,kihaku1974,0,Sat Jun 6 17:13:12 2015 UTC,"She does appear to be a special kind of stupid.   Attacking the ""rich people marina""  and also the Mobile World Congress because they are ""not for (all of)  the people""  she is actually achieving the impossible, before getting into office she is starting to make the PP seem like normal rational sages."
Barcelona,38s185,BudParc,2,Sat Jun 6 10:27:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's stupid enough to drag the economy into the dirt. I think she's a populist politician saying these things to appeal to her support base and increase her standing with ""the people"". She can't be stupid enough to gut the city's main income streams in the hope of improving quality of life. Time will tell how it all plays out, but I think a lot of these statements are sabre-rattling in an attempt to shake up the establishment."
Barcelona,38s185,desayunosaur,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:32:16 2015 UTC,"You're most likely right. Still, I feel all this talk can only hurt her. If she doesn't act on any of her threats she's gonna end up looking like all-talk to both her supporters and detractors."
Barcelona,38s185,plarah,0,Sat Jun 6 13:46:56 2015 UTC,You're most likely right too. This might be her lack of experience in the political arena coming to the fore.

Barcelona,38fms0,viktorbir,5,Thu Jun 4 06:58:36 2015 UTC,"Usually, for Catalans, the old part is whatever part was already built when they were kids. Old times are always better, you know?"
Barcelona,38fms0,Gamermoes02,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:06:37 2015 UTC,There is a part highly decorated and another part wich is very minimalistic. I enjoy the decorated part.
Barcelona,38fms0,motobrit,5,Thu Jun 4 15:27:15 2015 UTC,"For the first time since I had been in Barcelona I went to have a look at the cathedral -- a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous buildings in the world. It has four crenellated spires exactly the shape of hock bottles. Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution--it was spared because of its 'artistic value', people said. I think the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance, though they did hang a red and black banner between its spires.   George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia"
Barcelona,38fms0,motobrit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution   Umm, yes it was? Didn't they seriously damage the schools or something like that? I mean, I know Orwell, a well known socialist, isn't exactly an objective source of information on the Anarchist Commune."
Barcelona,38fms0,badal080,2,Thu Jun 4 06:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah... If you think that Orwell, rather than being just wrong, is misrepresenting the anarchists due to his lack of objectivity, then you're demonstrating exactly the right level of mental acuity required to be an anarchist."
Barcelona,38fms0,thebadrash,3,Thu Jun 4 07:24:36 2015 UTC,"Another thing: bear in mind that the average Spaniard/Catalan complains more stridently than, say, the average north European so don't take their negative comments too seriously ! :-)"
Barcelona,38fms0,badal080,2,Thu Jun 4 08:24:58 2015 UTC,It's not really very controversial here. I know that Subirachs' part of the facade is generally considered to be a mistake but the building itself is admired by almost everyone except /u/Sugusino.
Barcelona,38fms0,viktorbir,2,Thu Jun 4 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"I've only seen it from the outside but friends say it's quite stunning on the inside. No building will have 100% consensus but as far as city symbols go, I think it's fantastatic - far prettier than the Eiffel Tower. I understand that some neighbours will find the masses of tourists annoying but that comes with the territory (pun intended!)."

Barcelona,38fms0,Hair_Farmer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:05:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge Gaudi fan. A lot of his more famous work is very visceral, it looks to be made of bones and tendons and I find it very ugly and gross. But I was relieved to learn he did that on purpose, at first I was wondering if I was the only one seeing the  human skeleton.    I only saw the Passion Facade while walking by, didn't know there were other sides to see. It is a HUGE building and I really loved that! But I found the facade to once again look very disgusting and visceral. However, after reading that was done on purpose I appreciate it more. It's not my tastes, but I appreciate the artistry and effort. And I would love to see the inside, heard it's breathtaking."
Barcelona,38fms0,ken-wywietrznik,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"After living meters away from it on Avenida Gaudí and walking by it on my way to work everyday, I must say it is one of the more breathtaking and complex structures I've ever seen in my life. On the outside I wouldn't consider it especially beautiful but I admire the amount of foresight, inspiration, and planning that went into the cathedral.   Countless times I would be walking home from the bars only to stop, have a smoke, and marvel at it.   I can't really remember if I encountered anyone who had a profound hatred of the building. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and I guess it might not do it for some people."

Also, have you ever noticed that the jagged shape of the building makes it look like a stylized image of Montserrat? I mean, a bit like a cartoon version. I think so anyway."
Barcelona,38fms0,thebadrash,-5,Thu Jun 4 06:18:43 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most unique and spectacular buildings in the world. Spaniards like to complain about all the tourists, but in reality they're the only thing keeping their shitty economy somewhat afloat."

Barcelona,38cwex,Sugusino,3,Wed Jun 3 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"It might be a bit too early to find an apartment now for September. The notice of terminating an apartment lease is no more than 1-2 months, so many landlords probably won't know yet if their places will be free. Last year, I found my apartment (which was a very nice option too) in September to rent in October. So I wouldn't get too worried if you can't find something yet."

Barcelona,38brjo,beccamorty,3,Wed Jun 3 04:53:19 2015 UTC,"i would suggest going down the tefl route to start with and then make connections when you get here for the theatre world. you might get better luck with your arts admin skills as that could be used in museums  etc too  there are a lot of freelance costume people here so competition is tight. my people that do that sort of work are always saying about the tight walleted people here   as for etsy - a lot of people do etsy - technically you can do it through canada, and through a canadian bank account but it wont get you a visa here. self employed visas here are very hard."
Barcelona,38brjo,kihaku1974,2,Wed Jun 3 07:32:12 2015 UTC,"Start of with the TEFL but do it here, doing your course where your looking for work greatly increases your chances of finding work, plus good schools have a careers program locally to help.  If you do the CELTA at IH Barcelona or the TESOL CERT at Oxford House, you WILL find work.  Then you can worry about the other stuff after."
Barcelona,38brjo,Mr_B_86,2,Wed Jun 3 07:55:14 2015 UTC,"You'll need to look into NIE cards to work legally. It's usually one of those catch 22 situations where employers want you to have your NIE when you apply for the job, but you need a job to apply for a NIE...Then getting the paperwork through the system is another issue.  I think working as a freelancer or in the arts would be quite difficult/near impossible without speaking Spanish.  I knew one friend who got a job before arriving and it was because he could speak a couple of different languages, so he was basically translating in a call centre.  Teaching English, au pair and 'Backpacker' sort of jobs pop up all the time during the Summer, you just need to be ok with not making much money!"
Barcelona,38brjo,agoodliedown,2,Wed Jun 3 09:21:12 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend TEFL if you're interested in that. You would need to do a course somewhere like International House or Oxford first before getting a job offer, obviously. So, not sure exactly how visas are handled, but I'd say complete the course on a tourist visa first (also not sure how long the program is). You have a 3 month Schengen Visa to stay on with before you will need to apply for a work visa. So by then you should hopefully be ready for a job offer.      This may be outdated information, but a couple years ago I heard it was easier to get a freelance visa from Germany. Which would still be valid for all schengen zone.    Another option for getting work right away is to be an aupair. This website is by far the best, when I was on here before my inbox was blowing up with offers from Spain.    Good luck! :)"
Barcelona,38brjo,bromatologist,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:55:40 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the theater world here is that it'll be very difficult to find a job. Culture in general is having a really tough time due to the depression and increased taxes on performances. Which is not to say that it'd be impossible but I really think you'd need to be here getting to know people before you'd find anything.  Getting an 'autonomo' (self-employed) visa is v difficult indeed.  You could theoretically do the Etsy thing from here without a visa. I mean, it'd be illegal, but I guess you could get away with it. I'd say this or working (illegally, as well) as an English teacher are your best bets. Unless you can find some ancestor who grants you European citizenship!"
Barcelona,38brjo,thebadrash,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:16:43 2015 UTC,"as I understand the requirements, you must first have a job offer   The rules say that not only must you have a job offer, but there must be no suitable EU candidates, so I imagine this must be very difficult."

You can combine a different activity like walking/biking, views of Barcelona and surroundings (Montserrat, the sea, even the Pyrenees), and also enjoy what people says is the lungs of the city with its beautiful forests and hidden beauties (centennial fountains, abandoned mines, prehistorical furnaces and old ice pits, castle ruins, etc).  Check this route, it's 4 hours aprox. and it's possible to go and return by train, or even metro if you step off at Mundet station. Good luck!"

What most people do is find 2 or 3 close to their office and use them - it's a combination of trial and error and word of mouth. Most people will have a favorite within 5 minutes of their work (although when I worked in Nou Barris, there weren't really any decent ones nearby).  If you ever come through Cerdanyola, I can recommend Los Abetos and Bar Minguet :-)  What neighborhood are you thinking of?

I've met my share of unfriendly people, but I've also been here for a month. So who knows. But I'm looking forward to leaving."
Barcelona,3877jp,ThePowerOfDreams,2,Wed Jun 3 11:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think one of the problems on this sub is that the ratio of locals/ex-pats to visitors on here is pretty low. Which means that the same small number of people end up answering lots of very similar questions. So when someone comes on here with a really entitled ""Yo, plan my vacation for me, can't be bothered to read the wiki!"" type post (not saying that OP's was like that, I just mean in general), they're likely to get short shrift.  Edit: I'll add that on the whole, the regulars on this sub are friendly and helpful. Lots of subs for similarly popular cities remove all posts asking basic questions, and have stricter posting guidelines than we do.  We're always looking for ways to improve the sub, though, so that everyone feels at home.  A side issue might be that people in BCN often have quite a forthright way of talking to each other which visitors might sometimes find brusque or rude. This can take some getting used to. It's one of the reasons I like living where I do: we say hello to neighbors in the street, that sort of thing. But that can be difficult to find in the city."

Barcelona,383cfg,alexgmcm,3,Mon Jun 1 17:45:33 2015 UTC,a cap is just economically illiterate.   And totally impractical. What will she do? Build a wall around Barcelona and start checking passports? Good luck getting that round the EU rules on freedom of movement.   Far better would be to enforce the existing laws in terms of public order and tourist apartments.
Barcelona,383cfg,motobrit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:25:48 2015 UTC,Tourist apartments?   I don't know - I feel that people should be allowed to make whatever financial contracts they wish - government intervention tends to lead to unforeseen consequences as can be seen with rent controls etc.  I think the bad behaviour (which is really what annoys most people - the endless hen and stag parties and club 18-30 boozefests) could be solved with harsh fines for public order offences and strong enforcement of said fines.
Barcelona,383cfg,alexgmcm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:34:13 2015 UTC,"I feel this cap is intended for those massive ships bringing hordes of ""day tourists"" that flood the ramblas. It would not be hard to limit the amount of cruise lines that can anchor up at the port."
Barcelona,383cfg,fedezen,3,Wed Jun 3 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think illiterate is the journalist who produced this bullshit. In none of the quotes is she talking about a tourist cap, just about a freeze on creating new hotels and tourist apartments for 6 months to assess the situation.   The telegraph hack who (literally) produced this piece of ""news"" seems to have taken that tourist cap out of his arse."
Barcelona,383cfg,ken-wywietrznik,4,Tue Jun 2 09:45:39 2015 UTC,"When an area gets saturated, do you keep putting people in? Or do you cap it?

Barcelona,383cfg,aenemic,2,Mon Jun 1 20:16:29 2015 UTC,What is saturated? It brings money into the city and creates jobs etc.  I don't like stag parties etc. either but with the economy the way it is I'd much rather have the city making money than losing it.

I think they need much harsher fines for public order offences and a reputation for serious enforcement though.  Tourism is good - drunk tourists running riot isn't. But it's stupid to conflate the two."
Barcelona,383cfg,alexgmcm,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:38:02 2015 UTC,"You have a point, but at the same time it's hard to tax tourism. People skip taxes through airbnb, and you'd have to avoid taxing stuff that locals use."

Barcelona,383cfg,jogarz,5,Mon Jun 1 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Well, the amount of tourists has made parts of the city completely off-limits to locals. Las Ramblas is a good example. There's nothing authentic there anymore, it's an enormous tourist trap. The restaurants sell frozen paella, the bars will sell you a ""default"" one pint beer, the shops along the ramblas sell fake overpriced crap and La Boquería is so crowded that you almost can't get in. And even if you do half the shops sell just tourist stuff.  Last week this guy was told he couldn't show his friends around Park Guell, because that's the official guides job. And we have to pay now to get there, because it was too overcrowded."
Barcelona,383cfg,tiorancio,4,Mon Jun 1 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"If you're respectful and well behaved, you're more than welcome. Everyone here knows that tourism is important. The idea is to just not sell the whole city off for tourism."
Barcelona,383cfg,thebadrash,2,Mon Jun 1 19:20:27 2015 UTC,people need something to rail against. and in barcelona it can be at the tourists simply down to numbers in order to incite knee jerk reactions from people to get approval for bad policies that in the long term have bad end results.

Barcelona,37ywde,magelat,3,Sun May 31 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"The historical museum of Barcelona is really neat. You can go underneath the city and see the ruins of the original Roman streets.  In addition to that do a New Europe free walking tour. It shows some great gems in Ciutat Vella area and tells a lot about Barcelona's interesting history.  They do expect you to tip, though. Another cool thing is the Palau Guell. It's the mansion Gaudi built for the industrial tycoon that financed most of his work. It's one of his more traditional works but very exquisite.   Also try to go out in the Gracía neighborhood. When the weather is nice the locals all hang out and party in the many city squares and there are some cool hangouts that aren't super touristy.     When it comes to the beach, where the metro and buses drop off is the most crowded but if you head north a little (the opposite direction of the W) the sand becomes a lot less rocky and there are some great places to eat paella.      Tibidabo is also pretty cool. It's Barcelona's highest peak and there is a church and amusement park on top.    The old gothic cathedral also has some days where you can take an elevator all the way to the top and walk on a cat walk on the roof. It's super neat.   As you can tell I really miss Barcelona. Hope you have a great time!"

Quoting from their FAQ page:   ""The information stand is also used as a lost property stand. At the end of each day, all the objects which have been handed in are taken to the production offices and the next day they are taken back to the information stand where they can be reclaimed.  When the festival is over all the lost property is taken to the Primavera Sound offices. If you have lost something and you have not reclaimed it during the festival you can get in touch with us at info@primaverasound.com"".   Don't give up - I (stupidly) lost my wallet during a Slayer gig last summer @ Brutal Assault 19 (what a gig, what a moshpit!), and someone returned it (almost untouched) to the organizers. Battered, with a lot of insignificant crap missing, but my IDs & credit cards were all there. I got it the day after the gig. Anonymous people can be cool!"

One pass lasts me almost two weeks, so it's a pretty good deal. Everything you need is within walking distance and even if it isn't, I still usually either walk there and take transit home or vice versa.    EDIT: You also buy your pass at these machines in the metro station, so it's really easy and not stressful to browse through all the options and see what suits you.

Barcelona,37p7eu,thebadrash,1 point,Fri May 29 14:27:42 2015 UTC,Maybe try 'kickball pinnacle event' or 'sporting jubilee'?  Sorry. Just go to any bar in the city. Ideally one well away from the tourists.
Barcelona,37p7eu,Ruuh,1 point,Sat May 30 07:10:38 2015 UTC,"Those are strange keywords, tbh. Try 'see football', 'watch football', 'big screen', etc.  I don't know about big screens for the final, but any local bar will do. Just walk down some interesting looking street an hour before the match and look for a bar that looks good to you. Practically all of them will show the match, which is why you won't get many specific replies - people tend to go to the one comfy place they like just down the street. There are sports bars in the wiki, but they'll probably be overrun by tourists."

Barcelona,37i0hj,bromatologist,4,Wed May 27 19:56:36 2015 UTC,i would suggest looking at the primevera (the music thingy) forum/websites as some of the off site parties are word of mouth etc.

Barcelona,377k7v,arechsteiner,6,Mon May 25 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is classic petty officialdom. They'd do well in England!"
Barcelona,377k7v,thebadrash,10,Tue May 26 05:04:44 2015 UTC,That is a sad reflection on the park. I recently visited and was excited to show my wife only to find out we couldn't get into most of the park now (without waiting a long time and paying) and that you could only buy tickets at certain times to get into the paid area - a sad change indeed!
Barcelona,377k7v,mog538,4,Mon May 25 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"If you live here you can get in for free.  And in fact, it's not ""most of the park"" you couldn't get into. Maybe a 10% of it, the monumental part, which before was super extra crowded with tourists."

Barcelona,377k7v,Rein3,2,Mon May 25 23:01:02 2015 UTC,They have not changed it. Has always been this way (where always means since it's not free for all).  http://lameva.barcelona.cat/barcelovers/ca/gaudir-mes-de-barcelona-es-molt-facil
Barcelona,377k7v,viktorbir,2,Tue May 26 11:57:23 2015 UTC,It's more than 10% and it's the main part of the park. I don't live there and even if I did the times were restricted and then it would have been even more time queuing to get in so it would be even more frustrating and time wasting than dealing with a busy area. It still seemed super extra crowded from what I could see.
Barcelona,377k7v,mog538,1 point,Tue May 26 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"I was kind of up-set at this at first as well since I normally go running in the woods behind the park and whatnot, however, it used to be SUPER crowded in the monument section to the point where it was impossible to see or do anything in this area.  It was a complete non-sense cluster.  Most of the park, walking paths, places where people sit and play music, ect. are still open and free to stroll around.  In Short : it sucks you have to pay but at least now it is manageable and possible to take photos with friends who visit and see the monuments rather than be sloshed around in a wave of tourists (now you're just slightly jostled)."
Barcelona,377k7v,Penguin00,1 point,Tue May 26 13:28:57 2015 UTC,The paying part was a turn off but the bigger pain I thought was that we were told you could only pay at certain times and it was going to be another 4 or 5 hours before we could get in - that is the ridiculous part.
Barcelona,377k7v,mog538,1 point,Fri May 29 12:56:52 2015 UTC,yeah especially now since its peak season I get it.  Fortunately they let you but tickets online too so you can plan your trip!

Barcelona,377k7v,sensei888,3,Tue May 26 06:54:32 2015 UTC,Don't tell me that any one you were actually enjoying the park with the hordes of tourists and merchants everywhere. I always hate it there. It's more like a museum.

Barcelona,374moo,love_the_octopus,6,Mon May 25 03:46:11 2015 UTC,"Podemos decided not to present candidates to local elections, only to some authonomies, since they felt they did not have enough reliable candidates or did not have enough time to create a network of representation.  Instead, they gave support to citizen proposals in several cities. As such, Pablo Iglesias (podemos) did take part in a meeting with Ada Colau (Barcelona en Comú), and they are included in the list of organizations supporting BeC.  Nevertheless, BeC was created roughly at the same time as Podemos (under the name ""Guanyem Barcelona""), and they are originally different projects, although with very similar ideas."

Now there's this new party called Podemos (left wing) that's made quite a splash in all of Spain. They don't use their brand for local elections, but instead they support ""citizenship candidacies"". If you see the results, they are the ones with names ""Ahora City Name"", ""City Name en común"", ""Ganemos City Name"", ""Cambiar City Name"" and similar ones.  Barcelona en Comú is is their brand for Barcelona, led by anti-eviction activist Ada Colau. They pretty much gathered votes from all the other parties and now have the key to take the mayorship by forming a rather complicated left wing coalition."

Yes, there are signs outside the establishments, bulletin to take or to ask for with all this info in concentrated form, and if you don't drink you can always look for the bar that offer the option of water or sodas (refreshments kind of beverages).

Our modern economy mainly extracts value to tax havens, sure it gives some jobs and development, but so would a more local economy.  Im not saying that every facet of the economy should be local, but if we want a real city and not one designed by multinationals and has the same feel and culture as every other big western city, locality needs to be fostered, and a local currenct aimed at improving the local economy could be a good sollution.  Imagine a local currency with a built in Universal Basic Income, which guarantees that you can buy your food, pay your rent and bills with it(which the UN Human Rights declaration tells us we all have a right to have, it mentions nothing of needing a job to be able to pay for it, its a right). Then you can have a job on top of that where all the money you earn can go to savings or traveling or whatever you want.

I ended up not doing the course because a job came up but I know people who have done: it's a perfectly decent course, will practically guarantee you work, and you'll meet lots of fellow (and possibly hot*) teachers.  Wine: you'll need to bone up on Catalan wines. With the greatest respect in the world, almost nobody here has ever touched a drop of Australian wine and that's not going to change. It's OK, though, because Catalan wines are better anyway.**  Everyone needs to register for a foreigner's number (NIE) and should register at the city hall.

That's without even getting to deep in the issue.   I do think they get a point across with this kind of activities, in the same way that the Black Block get's across destroying ATMs and banks. Sure, leftist and liberals in general tend to see this as petty vandalism, but I don't think the target of this demonstration are this groups, but people who are already borderline radicalized and need one last push to get into the action.   Finally, most big companies don't give a damn about anything, but profits, vandalizing stores is one of the fastest and easiest ways to hurt their income."

Barcelona,36qo4u,Sugusino,1 point,Thu May 21 20:53:55 2015 UTC,"Just playing devil's advocate, but I don't believe Nestlé was an elected democratic power either. But they hold political power because of something arbitrary that they sell. Society as a whole could vote with their dollar, but that's not the nature of our society. Society just isn't that intelligent to do so. But just because they're not that intelligent, doesn't mean they should be coerced by corporate power. So I think that some extracurricular activity, illegal or not is acceptable to balance the power between corporate power and the people. Where I come from, the United States, the people there are as dull and complacent as pathetic sheep because there is barely anything said, or shouted, or artistically rendered on the windows and walls of corporate enterprise, when a corporation devalues their natural identity and sells them their culture. The corporation isn't doing anything illegal. But they are absolutely threatening our indigenous sentiments, our individuality, and our ability to open our own stores, selling the designs of our own labor. So its tricky to navigate around them. And I support any means to do promote cultural/economic succession from big business, whether its artistic, illegal, legal, whatever. Just so long as no one is going to get hurt! :)"

And in general, I actually don't have that much of a problem with a few broken or spray-painted windows.  But a lot of people do. They worry it'll be their house or business next. And that's understandable.  Which is why occupying space, like the #15M protesters did, is so powerful. It doesn't hurt anybody, it's entirely peaceful, and the police have to crack heads to break things up. The vast majority of the Spanish public seemed to be behind the movements occupying the squares. And they probably would have been behind the Parlament protests too, if people hadn't started spray painting MPs."

Ultimately, companies are just money making machines, and it lies on the regulator to stop them from making ethically questionable choices.

But as a group, it requires all sorts of measures to define what you want as a group. So a group is always intellectually not as capable as an individual. That's all I meant. Please, don't ever assume I'm smart. I could never handle that kind of responsibility. :D  Anyways, sometimes they succeed, sometimes they fail.

By which you presumably mean not at all?   Oh no, wait: since small groups of dentists' and architects' sons dressed in their Bangladeshi-sweatshop-made black hoodies and splashed red paint on ATMs, the bankers and financiers hold no political power.   The Black Bloc have always been counter-productive to the movements they attach themselves to. They delegitimise popular movements and allow the police to escalate violence against peaceful protestors. The authorities love the Black Bloc.

I find it pretty frustrating when we organize for a general strike involving millions of workers and then the 15 kids throwing bottles at the Mossos in the evening make the headlines. IMO, there's an attitude of collusion between violent protesters who feel that publicity is the best way to further their cause and the media who like to present all protest and labor action as inherently violent and destructive.  I'll go beyond that: I know people who haven't participated in strikes concretely because of these people. So its's categorically a self-defeating gesture.  I'm no conspiracy theorist BUT... I'm very suspicious about police involvement in these sorts of actions. The use of agents provocateurs is documented and it happens a lot (everywhere, as far as I can tell). So there's that level of collusion as well."

Barcelona,36qctk,rollinrevue,34,Thu May 21 07:48:29 2015 UTC,"Some personal favorites:  Girona - beautiful medieval city and cathedral, excellent food. Could do (some of these) the same day: Pals & similar medieval walled villages of the Empordà. La Garrotxa - area of beautiful extinct volcanoes. Besalú - beautiful medieval town with fortified bridge. Cadaquès - typical Mediterranean fishing town. Figueres - Dalí Museum. Sa Tuna beach, Cap de Begur - a great place to have a swim and then have lunch. Just over the French border: Collioure/Cotlliure - French-Catalan fishing port. Very popular tourist destination for the French. Played host to Picasso, Matisse and others in its time, east at Casa Leon.  Tarragona - best Roman remains in Spain, the old city is beautiful, eat in the fishing port. Could do (some of these) the same day: Priorat - area that produces some of the world's best wines - head to Siurana for great hiking followed by good food and wine. Montblanc - medieval walled city. Poblet monastery.  Delta de l'Ebre - delta of Spain's biggest river. Produces large amount of rise, and well known for its paella-style dishes. Eat at La Casa de Fusta de l'Estany.  Terra Alta - the excellent castle at Miravet and the wines of Terra Alta (go to Barbara Forés at Gandesa).  Montserrat - sacred mountain about 30km out of BCN. Great for hiking. Decent restaurants nearby in the valley.  Mura - a nice, well preserved medieval village. Near 'la Mola' (Sant Llorenç del Munt, which also an excellent hike).  Montseny - another mountain which Catalans love. Famous for its great restaurants and perfect for a hike as well. We ate at Can Besa and had a fantastic meal.  Pyrenees/Prepirineu - Puigcerdà and la Cerdanya are worth visiting. If you're up to the drive, head up to Llívia and then follow the road via Pas de la Casa into Andorra: it's a pretty striking road with wonderful views of the mountains. Canigou (on the French side of the border, close to the Mediterranean coast) - stunning and emblematic mountain (requires some decent gear: risk of ice until high summer).

But it is expensive, I spent over 250 euros for just me and the Mrs.  For other good Michellin star food, the Roca Bar in Hotel Om is very very good and it is very well priced. It is the bar part of a big restaurant, and is much cheaper than the posh part, but still really good. It is run by the Roca brothers of El Celler de Can Roca fame (one of the worlds best restaurants, in Girona).  Go mid-week and book it ahead, it is probably the cheapest way to eat Michellin Star Catalan food in the city. Two of you could eat and drink for less than 50 euros.  link: http://www.hotelomm.com/en/roca-barcelona-en/roca-bar/  Other places like Tickets Bar are really good, but the waiting list is so long (months)."

Barcelona,36lump,Rein3,2,Wed May 20 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"The Bono 3G works a charm; it runs off Orange's network which is super-fast.   The only problem is that if you use more than your 3G it stops working (the documentation says it reduces in speed to 128k, but this is bullshit. It basically stops working). You can't 'top it up'; you have to wait until the month is out.  Possibly a better option (depending on how much data you're going to use) is Orange's Ballena pre-paid plan. If you have an Android phone you can use it as a wifi hotspot, and if you use up your 1G per month, you can buy another 1G by texting ""MAS DATOS BALLENA"" to some special number (which I forget). Each 1G costs about €10. That way you can also use it as a phone with data.   If you want to stream video or music, forget it.  Once upon a time I was in a similar situation and knocked on the neighbour's door, told them I was only there for a month, and offered them money for their wifi password (I'm a poor student who needs to study, of course). They gave it to me and wouldn't take any money for it, so I got them a nice bottle of wine."

Barcelona,36krgs,Pestaninha,5,Wed May 20 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"There have never been any stray dogs or cats for that matter in the city.   As with many other matters, there is an extensive regulation regarding domestic pets. In my opinion, too complex and restrictive in my opinion.   For instance, dogs must always be on leash. There are few places where dogs can run freely. Even if you go to the natural reserve of Collserola, or any of the beaches, dogs must be on leashes at all times.   On a more positive note, dogs have recently been allowed on the subway (not buses), as long as they wear a muzzle. This has been the single most significant step forward in the past decade.  As you mention there is limited poop on the streets, this is a combination of citizens becoming more aware of the problem and street cleaning at night.   I would like to see more focus on citizen education, and dog training. I would appreciate that authorities understood that beaches/parks are empty most of the year, and that dogs if properly trained are not a threat to others. This dog training has to start through education of the owners, not overregulation regulation."
Barcelona,36krgs,bosbcn,3,Wed May 20 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"Without getting into a whole /r/dogs style debate (those people get angry!), I basically agree with you. Certainly there should be more beach access in Catalonia as a whole: in the summer there are only a handful of beaches you can go to and that pisses me off. Everyone lets their dog off the lead in Collserola... the biggest danger is mountain bikers using paths they're not supposed to be on. But we walk in bits of Collserola several times a week and never have any problems with having Larry off the lead.  Personally, I feel there should be more controls on dangerous breeds. That's not a popular point of view with people who own dangerous breeds but there you go. Perhaps better training would suffice. All I know is that the only trouble I've ever had with other dogs has always been from 2 or 3 breeds. Maybe you should need a license for them, to show that you can train them properly?"
Barcelona,36krgs,thebadrash,2,Wed May 20 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really believe there's such a thing as a dangerous breed.   But there are breeds that a certain irresponsible type of person likes to buy, and those people are often no good at training dogs.   The most aggressive and unpredictable dog I know belongs to a friend who's really just no good with dogs (the dog is the boss in his household). It's a border collie FFS: you could train it to do the crossword.  But yeah, the number of poorly trained dogs in the city is way too high; I guess it's because I'm a country boy and come from a family of dog owners. The dog areas in the parks and squares in the city are bedlam most of the time: people unable to call their dogs back without bribing them, dogs that haven't been socialised with other dogs; drives me crazy.   And don't get me started on the totally unsuitable breeds for a city where it's hot a lot of the time. Saint Bernards? Huskies?"
Barcelona,36krgs,motobrit,3,Wed May 20 07:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a country boy too (Devon) and grew up with dogs. I think you're at least partly right regarding dogs that irresponsible types are drawn to. I think there's definitely something in that.  At the same time, I strongly believe that if we are willing to ascribe certain attributes to certain breeds (intelligence, task solving, herding, laziness, hard working, timidity, etc) then surely we can accept that some breeds are more predisposed to being very protective or even aggressive? I do understand that not everyone agrees with me on this, though.  The Husky thing: totally agree."
Barcelona,36krgs,thebadrash,3,Wed May 20 08:02:44 2015 UTC,"then surely we can accept that some breeds are more predisposed to being very protective or even aggressive?   Yeah, fair enough.   Though I've only ever been bitten by one dog: a tiny little hairy terrier thing!"

I'm not in ICV anymore but when I was, everyone I knew - everyone - was pro-independence. Also in Colau's group are the Procès Constituent people who are openly pro-independence.  Personally, I wouldn't buy the line being trotted out by CiU and ERC that voting for Colau is voting against independence. I don't think it's a fair accusation."

Unfortunately, she is a covered no, and what's worse, she is together with fucking Podemos, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot, than vote for that guy. I'm quite surprised that the people you know from ICV are pro-independence... normally tends to be the opposite. And yeah, ICV is another of those parties I learnt to hate. PP never lied about what they are, I'd never vote for them, but they are clear about their fucked up thoughts. ICV is just random, one day they say A and the next one they say B. Funnily enough, many friends are from ICV and none of them is pro-independence.  I didn't even hear ERC or CIU saying that about Colau but still, tht's not what made me decide... :p   I just hope we don't get the ""british elections"" to happen here, because then we will be fucked because of a bad strategy by the left..."
Barcelona,36homg,sennacheribbo,2,Wed May 20 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"Let me just add: I'm pro-independence. I'll be voting ERC in Cerdanyola because I genuinely believe it's the best chance for change at municipal level. And for me, that's the key: we're voting at municipal level. What's right for CdV may not be right for BCN. ERC in BCN didn't seem to have much of a platform beyond 'independence', but Colau does. So I agree that independence is probably the key political question of our time but I also believe that at municipal level, other matters are also very important.  I mean, it's not like Catalonia will become independent but suddenly lose Barcelona as capital."

Barcelona,36gvha,F18Ace,7,Tue May 19 08:09:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry but it's illegal for you to work here without a permit, which is relatively difficult to obtain. Same as if I went to the USA and tried to find work.  The best you can hope for is:   Find a job where you can work online, but based in the USA. I know several people who are formally employed in their home country but work from BCN online. Hunt around for a bar which is willing to pay people off the books. I guess lots of them do it but obviously there's some increased risk for them which I imagine is passed on to you in the form of lower wages. Look into arranging work now and getting all the paperwork. Go it alone and do private tuition. This is what many of my American friends do here. They earn enough to live fairly well.   Working illegally has its pitfalls: you won't be covered for healthcare, for example.  For accommodation, check out the wiki:  there's a neighborhood guide and some info on which websites to use (i.e. not Craigslist)."
Barcelona,36gvha,thebadrash,1 point,Tue May 19 08:30:38 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Yeah I was planning on getting a work visa if at all possible. Although I wasn't sure how commonly they were given out.   I'm really just looking to break even and extend my stay until possibly February when I'll have to return.   The private tutoring sounds like a good option. If it's not a hassle for you could you shoot one a message and ask if they might tell me how they went about it? I'd be happy to correspond with one over e-mail.   I really appreciate your taking the time to respond.

Haha. Maybe cockles or some other canned seafood delicacy? Or, if he is a thrift store-loving hipster maybe go to Mercat dels Encants, the big flea market, or even the Sant Antoni book market and get him something unique and antique.

There are not so many tourists around compared to the centre and it has a local feel (without the ""bohemian"" Gracia vibe which I dislike) The majority of decent restaurants are located in Exiample.

Barcelona,362atb,maxgregor,4,Fri May 15 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"Actually Eixample is not a neighbourhood but a district, the most populated in the city, it encloses some 'barris' that are somewhat different. Living in Sagrada Familia is not the same as living in Fort Pienc, or next to Passeig de Gracia or Sant Antoni.  Besides that, in my opinion is boring because is very big with wide streets, identical crossings and monotonous architecture. Not a district where you'll enjoy strolling around.  That being said, it is of course a very good place to live. Flats are more than decent, you are in the middle of the city, close to everything and you may enjoy tranquility if you choose your street wisely, avoiding high traffic areas."
Barcelona,362atb,sennacheribbo,11,Fri May 15 16:31:30 2015 UTC,monotonous architecture? Biggest facepalm ever.

What I can tell you is that here in Barcelona, with that wage, you must share a flat (rent a room).  HP pays 26k, KPMG/PWC/DTT pay 24k, smaller companies are more on the 18k side. To know the exact amount you would perceive every month you can use this tool:   http://www.expansion.com/ahorro/calculadora-sueldo-neto.html   Bruto anual = 26000 Número de pagas = usually 12, but depends on the company, sometimes is 14, even 15.

Barcelona,35veer,ThePowerOfDreams,3,Thu May 14 06:17:48 2015 UTC,"Secure destruction of hard drives is super easy, even for the most paranoid.  All you need is one overwrite of zeroes across the entire drive to make it prohibitively expensive (and near impossible) for a malicious actor to recover the data.   For storage devices containing magnetic media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are applied to attempt to retrieve the data.   http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf  You can use regular desktop tools (like Eraser) to wipe any non-OS disk and bootable tools (any linux distro's dd, dban 2.2.7 (2.2.8 was after they were bought out)) for OS disks.  They can then be safely reused or resold.  ATA Secure Erase uses built in commands on the drive itself, so even inaccessible sectors get erased as well.  This is the only method suitable for SSDs.  If you are especially paranoid, grab a torx head to extract the platters and manually destroy them, take a drill press to the entire drive (puncturing the platters), or really anything that physically damages the platters to the point it won't spin and there are huge spots of missing data, then hand it in to Punt Verd (/u/ThePowerOfDreams ).    If you are dealing with removable flash media (USB drives, SD cards, etc), just bash it with a hammer until it's a fine powder (or all the chips are broken)."
Barcelona,35veer,chemcat392,3,Thu May 14 00:08:26 2015 UTC,"DBAN is great for this, but honestly it's so much more fun to just beat the fuck out of the drive and then send it for recycling.  Some companies have agreements in place with drive manufacturers to permit them to certify that they physically destroyed drives that failed under warranty (and still receive a replacement) instead of returning them, so destruction has its place."

Barcelona,35pj0q,alaninsitges,2,Tue May 12 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"I have been faced with this scam many times, both as an inquiring renter and as someone renting out a flat. It's SO ridiculously transparent. Who even falls for this? Sadly, I guess it's usually elderly people."

Barcelona,35pj0q,stewartmcg,3,Wed May 13 07:22:36 2015 UTC,"An easy way to filter these out (other than the fact that they're too good to be true) is to right-click one of the images (in Chrome, anyway) and choose ""Search Google for this image"".  You'll then see all the other cities the scammer is posting the ad in, and probably the original ad.   It's absolutely trivial to generate these ads, so not a lot of point in trying to collect warnings about them, IMO.   Also, I've seen a few Facebook posts on the various guiri groups saying ""Do not trust this man/woman"" complete with names, photos of passport etc. Obviously, this person is almost certainly completely innocent, and has sent a scan of their passport as requested by the scammer. So don't do that."

Barcelona,35pwib,NYKyle610,8,Tue May 12 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"Take the metro to Espanya station and follow the signs to L8. Buy a TransMontserrat ticket from the yellow machines there. There are two options, Cremallera and Aeri; I recommend the Cremallera (rack railway) over the Aeri (cable car), which specifies the final leg of the journey to the monastery.  The TransMontserrat includes everything you need, except lunch; if you want a hot buffet lunch, get the TotMontserrat instead.  The TransMontserrat and TotMontserrat tickets include a few metro trips as well; use them in metro fare gates when you get back into town until they stop working, then switch back to your T-10."

Barcelona,35pwib,viktorbir,0,Tue May 12 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"That's a commercial name. It's not a metro. And it doesn't take you to Montserrat, but to Monistrol, I think, and then you must take the funicular."
Barcelona,35pwib,ThePowerOfDreams,2,Tue May 12 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Correct, and there are combined tickets which include the funicular.  Point is, you can get there from BCN without any trouble at all. Heck, one of the tickets even includes a meal."

I will promise you that any cheap plastic fan will almost certainly die within a year of use, so keep the receipt.   The 'flat' fans are great, cheap ones are noisy, but all are copies of the VentAxia ""Meteor""  that is no longer in production."

Otherwise the breach for sure, just make sure you go out of the centre as the ones in the city are not very clean. Also, there are playgrounds everywhere. I hope that helps a bit"

This BIS event looks great. Particularly excited to see Head High, Tin Man, and ATFA on the same bill.   Electric Minds x Monocult and Hinge Finger x Hessle Audio tend to be great parties every year, but BeCool isn't the best venue.  And like every year, the official Sonar is a safe bet, but with the typical drawbacks of large music festivals (short sets, large venues, etc.)."

Barcelona,35l5hf,lotusblau,1 point,Mon May 11 13:02:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a good week planned!  I wouldn't say there are a ton of spontaneous things - the only one I can think of is Richie Hawtin doing his Boqueria set (though last year he didn't, opting instead for a much less spontaneous 'DotUp' event at Parc de la Ciutadella).   But who knows, I tend to opt for the official festival (supplementing with OFF events earlier in the week, Thursday night, and Sunday) so maybe I'm just not aware of more spontaneous events that take place those days."
