mycology,3dyy1m,AlanRockefeller,10,Mon Jul 20 17:47:29 2015 UTC,Fascinating. Did you discover the bioluminescence by coincidence or were you expecting it? Extremely good photo pairs on Mushroom observer!
mycology,3dyy1m,thefrisker,28,Mon Jul 20 17:57:21 2015 UTC,"Last year I took a walk at midnight in the rain while camping in the Mexican state of Hidalgo.   I told my friend that I was going to look for bioluminescent mushrooms - he said ""bueno, suerte"" - he clearly didn't think I would find any.    5 minutes later, after stepping in countless puddles I found them and was really surprised by how bright they were.    Recently I have found the same species in Veracruz in three locations.   A review of the literature shows that this species is new to science.  Since then he has changed his field of study from Psilocybe to be the bioluminescent mushrooms of Mexico, and we go walking in pitch darkness most nights.   We find them 95% of the time, the other 5% are places that are really high elevation, restricting the species diversity.  I have discovered two or three new bioluminescent species this week, and the scientific paper will describe about 15 new species."
mycology,3dyy1m,thefrisker,10,Mon Jul 20 18:24:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking your time to tell the story. Would love to see the paper when published. Have you by any chance on your nightly walks spotted a bioluminescent slime mold? (Have recently been in a discussion about whether or not it exists).
mycology,3dyy1m,thefrisker,13,Mon Jul 20 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"I have not seen any bioluminescent slime mold, and I doubt that it exists.  Someone mentioned a bioluminescent lichen the other day, but I kind of doubt it.  Here is what I do see - a lot of fireflies, glowing worms which might be firefly larvae, some really tiny glowing grubs and fungi.  The insects can be distinguished from fungi at night from a distance because they are point light sources, and the light from fungi is much more spread out.   Among the glowing fungi the most common variety in Mexico make the leaves glow green, but the mushroom itself does not glow.  Sometimes huge patches of the forest floor will glow brightly.  The mushrooms which do this are primarily extremely tiny Mycenas, with a max cap diameter of 1 mm.   Some Mycenas have a cap that glows, and sometimes the whole mushroom glows.  On one species we found, only the stem glows."
mycology,3dyy1m,IHaveABiologyDegree,5,Mon Jul 20 19:22:33 2015 UTC,An amazing world. Our relatively cold nights in the forest contains nothing glowing. What's fascinating is the sounds. But they're likely not caused by mushrooms. Congratulations with all the new species (What a magnitude of a scoop!).
mycology,3dyy1m,patterned,3,Mon Jul 20 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"You read about that circadian-regulated bio-luminescent mushroom paper published recently? They show that glowing mushroom-shaped things attract insects, indicating that this may be why they glow."

mycology,3dyy1m,gwtkof,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:57 2015 UTC,So they can spread their spores. Some mushrooms spores are coated by a glue that makes it easier to stick to surfaces.  Since the insects are eating the cap where the spores are located they tend to get in contact with them then they spread the spores further and the cycle can continue.

But before you go to Mexico you should thoroughly check all the habitats that are within driving distance of where you live.  You will probably discover a few, and you can practice photographing bioluminescent mushrooms in the woods at night.  We are finding the most bioluminescent species in the ""bosque mesofilo"" habitat, which are the mixed cloud forests between 1500 and 2600 meters.   Tomorrow we are going to check some tropical selva habitats.   We have checked habitats above 2600 meters and found that nothing was glowing.

mycology,3dwso1,00WELVAERT,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:03 2015 UTC,what do you plan on doing with it other than eating it? how do you plan on preserving what you can't eat relatively soon?

mycology,3dwso1,magzma16,4,Mon Jul 20 14:47:53 2015 UTC,"You HAVE to cook them in fat before freezing.  Either batter and deep fry or pan fry in butter.  They will turn into carboard if you freeze them without cooking them in fat first.  I know this from experience.  A stir fry isn't enough either.  They need to be cooked alone.  I prefer to batter with either tempura or Andy's Cajun and deep fry.  Then I can take them out and heat in the oven throughout the year.  Boneless chicken wings, strips, and patties (if you get large enough tender pieces)."
mycology,3dwso1,Tankbean,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, they are so good when they are coated and fried like chicken! Good to know that you can pre-make them as chicken-nuggets for heat up later since that's half of the work already done. I agree, tried the freezing and they did turn to cardboard. Thanks!!"
mycology,3dwso1,magzma16,4,Mon Jul 20 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"My wife and I eat pretty healthy, but bought a large deep fryer that only gets used for preserving chicken of the woods.  When you get a few large harvests over the course a couple months, there is no way even you and all your friends and family can eat 50+lbs.  They reheat really well.  I do 350F for about 10-15mins depending on the thickness of the pieces.  I also try to cut them in similar sized pieces before frying.   Protip: Egg washing and battering a dozen lbs to fry is a huge mess and pita.  I make a hybrid beer-tempura batter.  Tempura is just 1 part cold water to 1 part flour.  I use beer in place of cold water and do 50/50 flour/Andys Cajun.  It turns out awesome."

I'm designing a short golf course that is founded in the tenets of permaculture so all the design elements have multiple functions. I am incorporating a design element of using railroad ties on the golf course to pay respect to a renowned golf course architect. Railroad ties are treated with a lot of chemicals and hydrocarbons and are often environmentally hazardous (I forgot they were treated with creosote!). I hoped there was a way to use fungi to grow food while disposing of a hazardous product that serves a function on how a golf course looks and plays. Sorry if that was jibberish.

Maybe decomposed isn't the right word, but the mushroom tissue breaks down due to enzyme action. The whole cap eventually liquifies until only the stalk remains, which is quite thin on these. The dissolving of the cap, which bears the spores, is the means by which these types of mushrooms spread spores.  The shaggy inky cap is edible and tasty before it breaks down. Coprinus comatus. They're distinct due to the scaly cap surface. Coprinus atramentarius is closely related, and also edible, but this one lacks the scales on top. While it's typically edible, it reacts badly with alcohol, and it can make you quite sick if you have the two in your system concurrently."

mycology,3du9n4,najjex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"That is the closest I have been able to find, however I spent a long time looking at polyrhizum pics on the net last night, at many different stages of growth. None of mine have opened at all, not even a crack. A few holes, which leads me to think the ones that have holes (larger and higher out out of the ground) are older ones that have already released their spores. Wouldn't I have seen even a crack? I plan to keep an eye on them to see if any do open.  Also, On the web I didn't find one picture of ""melted"" edges, not even a tiny bit. Have you (or anyone) ever seen melty edges on a polyrhizum? Maybe they are out there, just no one published a pic.  Totally not discounting this ID, it's the most likely candidate. The melty edges just have me doubting it. One the hardest things for this novice (and probably all of us) is the plethora of different ""looks"" the same type can present, and this may just be a case of that."

I gave up harvesting them as there's no way to know by looking which are going to taste good and the good ones aren't that great anyway.
mycology,3dtfhc,christes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:41:03 2015 UTC,These are growing in a raised bed filled with soil purhased from a hardware store.  We've only had the soil for a few months.  The soil seems rather woody and has a strong smell of manure.  I'm fine just leaving the mushrooms as they are. It's a cool touch to the garden IMO.  I'm mostly curious about what having mushrooms here indicates for the soil and garden as a whole.

Even though these are edible boletes, these look waaaaay past their prime. Go ahead and cut the stem in half and take a chunk out of one of the caps, if there are any sorts of little brown dots or holes, then these are full of worms.

mycology,3dqiub,Moj88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"No boletes are deadly, although there are a few which are poisonous and so you should know how to identify them.  According to this website, poisonous boletes will turn blue instantly when you bruise them.  (That being said, not all blue staining boletes are poisonous.).  In addition some boletes in the Suillus genus will have a slimy cap that can give some people the runs.  You can try peeling the cap so this doesn't happen.   http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/Mushrooms.Folder/Bolete%20Overview.html  I went through the all bolete species listed in the Audubon mushroom guides to see if I can verify these rules of thumb.  The guides list 44 species, which is an incomplete list but has many of the common ones.  The guide appears to generally agree with the Steve Brill website.  Poisonous boletes bruise blue, although not all boletes that bruise blue are poisonous.  Also, slimy Suillus caps can cause diarrhea.  If your boletes don't bruise blue, I would take a little nibble to see if it's palatable, and spit it out.  Some boletes such as many of the Tylopilus genus (which tend to have a purplish stem) are very bitter.   As a safety precaution, make sure you always cook them first and proceed at your own risk.    A best way is to identify the actual species first.  However, I find this can be notoriously difficult for some boletes.  If you like, you can try using this guide to identify what you have: http://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletes.html"

The gills look oddly green on the over turned cap, but that may just be the lighting.  Most C. molybdites gills I find at that stage are dingy green."
mycology,3doaft,jastermareel17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"C. molybdites can indeed stain, a darkish red (as opposed to C. rhacodes, which stains saffron/reddish-orange). They don't always stain, but about half of those that I find locally (I'm in North Carolina) have a slight staining reaction; I'll try to post a couple pictures later for reference.    You can also see staining as one feature on the species description on Mushroom Expert: http://www.mushroomexpert.com/chlorophyllum_molybdites.html  Another reason I think this is C. molybdites is the arrangement of shagginess on the cap; this species usually has more peel like scales than shaggy bits, and the central nipple on C. molybdites is usually more pronounced. Finally, the location is another thing that's familiar to me; I find C. molybdites in grassy areas ALL THE TIME (they're very common here), but have yet to see any other parasol-type mushroom in such a setting. This doesn't mean that C. rhacodes doesn't ever pop in people's yards, but I've not seen it yet (always find my parasols in the woods). Anyway, the overall gestalt of this mushroom screams molybdites.  Anyway that's just my two cents."

For us, C. rachodes and Lepiota procera dominate our grass, I haven't found a C. molybdites yet, hence my bias.  The C. rachodes would stain from yellow-orange- deep red with a hollow stipe.  I like the add with the cap, I didn't know that.  On a side note, I have seen a bunch of L. procera in the NC State owned forest lab where they tested elevated CO2 on local pines.  Cool stuff!"

They do look similar at first glance, but upon closer inspection, you can tell the difference. Those look more like Leucoagaricus americanus. That's just a guess based on your photos, so don't go eating it without a definite ID. There are some Lepiota sp. that look like them, yet are lethal.

But you will be able to tell a little better after the caps spread, and a spore print if necessary.

mycology,3dmoem,SB-Corey,3,Fri Jul 17 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Random points related to the question:  I think each part of a fungus, variable by species, has different composition. Different enzyme concentrations in different places and therefore different chemical compositions. Some species may have very nutritious underground structures (Morel sclerotia?), some may be full of something but it may not be 'nutrition' (Ganoderma).  Eating a handfull of dirt can be more nutritious than a handfull of myceliated dirt, depending on what nutrients you're measuring.  Many fungi produce various exotic organic chemicals in the cap and specifically the pellicle. Calling these chemicals 'nutrients' would be questionable.  People often speak of mushrooms being high in vitamin D."

It's often referred to as one of the ""fool-proof 4"" mushrooms, since it's so easy to id.  In fact it's way easier to ID than chanterelles, due to the many chant species and variation in morphology among growing conditions.  Also, as far as I know, all the chicken of the woods look-alikes are also edible (black staining and Berkeley's polypores) or at least not toxic.  I work on rivers, so I'm able to collect dozens of lbs of chicken every year.  It's great as a direct chicken substitute in just about everything.

It was too old and tuff to be of any use.
mycology,3dkibn,jastermareel17,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:10:18 2015 UTC,"Those look more like Lactarius volemus than candy caps (L. fragilis and a few others).  What did they smell like?  L. volemus should have a lot of sticky milk that will stain brown and smell 'fishy' while L. fragilis will have a sweeter smell, less latex and are more uniformly colored (the gills aren't white but match the stalk and cap more).  Either way, both are good edibles for different uses."

Sun drying is great too, just take them out of the paper bag and put them in direct sunlight. Jaster has a good point about the gills. Candy caps are the same light brown color all around, with the occasional little cracks of lighter brown on the cap."

I see 3 different colors on these 3 pics. Consider Cantharellus cinnabarinus if they are red/orange or Craterellus ignicolor if they are yellow/orange. Where are you located?

mycology,3debof,hookahrino,39,Wed Jul 15 16:35:19 2015 UTC,"Mycologist here, accustomed to getting permits to collect mushrooms for field work.  The reason collecting in state/federal parks is illegal is because some people that collect mushrooms to make a profit do so in ways that are really harmful to the parks. According to park rangers I've spoken to, the collectors cut down lots of plants to form trails, stomp around on lots of plants, etc. The laws are generally in place to deter those folks, and so if you just collect a couple morels or what have ye while you're hiking, and you're careful not to disrupt things, you're keeping the spirit of the law ;)"
mycology,3debof,ScienceIsMetal,12,Wed Jul 15 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"This is a good perspective; although not as common on the east coast, there's a lot of damage done on the Pacific coast by commercial hunters. Once upon a time I drove up the 101 to Washington and found 3 separate commercial chanterelle camps where those who'd been there left all kinds of garbage, had hacked up the undergrowth, and generally made a mess (including leaving a huge heap of ""unpretty"" chanterelles behind that I guess they didn't think were nice enough to sell). This is not to say all commercial pickers do this, but it's a big enough issue to have some rules in place."
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,4,Wed Jul 15 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it's probably a very small fraction of commercial hunters that leave a negative trace. I just read an article a while back that most commercial hunters in the US are actually illegal immigrants, and so I'd be shocked if those folks were leaving much of a damage-trail, considering the ramifications if they got caught.  That said, moreso for plants than with mushrooms, the collection laws also keep people from harvesting rare and endangered species.  I'm from Washington and did a Master's in MA, and was amazed at how much more open the forests are there. I wonder, /u/MushroomAnna if the west coast gets more damage just by virtue of having so much more understory."
mycology,3debof,ScienceIsMetal,3,Wed Jul 15 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"As for commercial pickers and their impact...yeah I think it's a drop in the bucket, especially when stacked up against the damage of commercial logging, ranching, and the like. I do think there's a stigma about mushroom picking commercially because somehow mushrooms are seen as so expensive or fancy that some folks (not rangers, but the population at large) assume that folks who do it are greedy and don't care about the environment. It's very similar to the ginseng in the Appalachian Mountains; there are plenty of folks who have been doing it sustainably for generations, and then a number of more recent harvesters who end up overharvesting and damaging the habitat. Anyway, as for mushroom picking I think the damage is largely to plant populations, not the mushrooms, with the exception of Matsutake in Japan I haven't heard of anyplace where mushrooms were ""hunted to extinction,"" and in the case of Japan that was more due to habitat destruction for logging as opposed to overhunting, at least according to some sources. I love that study that the Oregon Myco Society did with chanterelle patches, trying to determine whether harvesting methods damaged the mycelium...and basically came away with the conclusion that it doesn't matter how you pick the mushrooms...what matters is rain and habitat."
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,2,Wed Jul 15 20:19:25 2015 UTC,National forests are generally all open for harvesting for personal consumption.
mycology,3debof,StumbleBees,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:05:33 2015 UTC,"I would think that's very possible, especially considering that there are also a lot of forests that have been more recently logged/replanted monoculture out west. You rarely see the sheer number of downed trees here in North Carolina than you're likely to see doug firs down all around OR/WA. Our only exception is the loblolly pine, which is grown for timber and has a very shallow root system, which means the trees grow too quickly and the shallow topsoil (lots of sand and clay here) do not support them. Although I am not a botanist, it does seem that you also have a lot more fragile plants on the forest floor in the northwest."
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,8,Wed Jul 15 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"This is a State by State, and - for Federally owned lands - Park by Park issue. My state (what's up New York! Be kind to your local Environmental Conservation Officers) allows foraging from all state-owned, NYSDEC controlled, lands for personal consumption (this makes the Adirondacks fair game). Many states have a personal consumption exclusion. Don't lie to the Park Rangers, be honest about your intentions.  HOWEVER. Commercial foraging on State and Federal Lands, if legal, almost always requires a permit. You may obtain this permit from your State's Environmental or Parks Agency (my state has both as both control their own set of parks, and each has its own rules). For federal permits, call your regional U.S. Forestry office for more info.  Edit: Source, I regulate this for a living."
mycology,3debof,armchairepicure,5,Wed Jul 15 18:10:00 2015 UTC,In Finland you can pick mushrooms even on private land (as long as you're not right next to anyone's residence etc).
mycology,3debof,paxillus_involutus,12,Wed Jul 15 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"US laws with regards to trespassing are very different - and a bit more bizarre and convoluted - than anything that I saw in Europe.  In the US, it's a lot more ""this land is mine and don't you dare touch anything or come near it or even look too closely at it"" whereas in countries that I've hiked in Europe there's much more of a right of way sort of rule.  To be honest, I'm not sure that I'd say that one is better than the other (if I had a forest, I don't know that I'd want someone to just be able to wander in and pick the mushrooms from my forest), but there are big cultural differences between attitudes towards land.  In the US if you are shown to not be actively maintaining the borders of your land, you can lose ownership of it ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession#United_States ).  In general, I found the European approach to be refreshingly different to the US when I was there."
mycology,3debof,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,5,Wed Jul 15 19:37:46 2015 UTC,My question is: Why would people assume that removing valuable property from land that isn't their own is legal and appropriate?  Always keep this on the DL.
mycology,3debof,StumbleBees,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:08 2015 UTC,Depends on where you are. From what I understand in many countries in europe you have the rite to forage on any land. No hunting or taking purpose grown plants but wild grown stuff is free game.

State parks are a totally different kettle of fish. Generally, if it's a ""park,"" maintained for public recreation, only permitted and scientific mushroom foraging is likely to be allowed. And even then it can get dicey. I know of one mycologist who was taking photos for a new California identification field guide who was detained in a park after rangers spotted him photographing a type collection. I think it all ended up being OK, but it was a sobering reminder of how well some rangers/park minders take to mushroom people."

mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:15:40 2015 UTC,"It's illegal in the National Parks, but legal in National Forests, although different Forests have different rules about the amount you can pick, whether or not you need a permit, what counts as ""commercial"" mushroom harvesting (which often has a permit that costs something). In North Carolina all state parks are off-limits, as are the city and county parks. This is why I stick to gamelands and National Forests in general"
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,2,Wed Jul 15 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that exchange, I agree that his downvoting came off as a bit harsh...but I wouldn't worry about it too much. I get this question (where can I legally hunt?) a lot and I often have to spend time explaining the difference between ""state forest,"" ""state park,"" ""national forest"" and ""national park,"" so his point about it wasn't completely off-base, even if the downvoting was. But yeah, getting the code out there is very helpful, it makes it super-clear, at least as far as the state parks are concerned."
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,4,Wed Jul 15 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true, however I don't think it was inappropriate to add information about where you can hunt mushrooms. It's good to know that you cannot pick in parks, but it's equally good to know that you CAN pick in national forests, gamelands, and (in some places) state forests."
mycology,3debof,MushroomAnna,3,Wed Jul 15 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"Well sure that sounds inappropriate. You should talk with the mods if you're having issues. Although fwiw, Reddit has automatic downvote algorithms that it runs to shave off a few upvotes here and there on threads with a lot of activity, so as not to artificially bump newer posts to the top. It happened with a thread I made yesterday, I thought we had a downvote fairy until someone set me straight. But yeah I hear what you're saying; I blog about mushrooms and every now and again someone will take it upon themselves to get annoyed with me about something I wrote (or didn't write), and it's like jeez dude go to wordpress.com and get yourself an account, then you can get whatever info out there that you want to."

mycology,3dg1vr,Drewboy64,3,Thu Jul 16 00:02:49 2015 UTC,I like eating insects so maybe I am a odd ball in this. I eat mushrooms that are still solid and not soggy. Even the soggy ones I sometimes collect just to put over alittle heat and let the maggots crawl out then I throw the gross shroom away and stir fry the maggots with good mushrooms. You can get them pretty crispy in butter then you can add a touch more salt. They are some of the better tasting bugs out there. You can get a nice palm full of protein from a large old edulis.
mycology,3dg1vr,pwndbyachick,2,Thu Jul 16 06:41:25 2015 UTC,I'll have to try this sometime.  So what about the other bugs?  I often see small black bugs with shells squirming out of mushrooms and the like.  Have you tried those as well?
mycology,3dg1vr,zoorbsension,2,Thu Jul 16 07:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend washing, then dicing heavily bug covered ones. remove any beetles or noticeable bugs. Then cook it with some seasoning or whatever and you'll probably never notice you ate any (dead) larvae."

By shit I mean poop. 1) maggots won't kill you to eat. 2)a large percent of the world eats bugs as a regular part of their diet. 3)some bugs are really tasty. 4)seriously try a bug now and then, they are good."
mycology,3dg1vr,Skidmarking,3,Thu Jul 16 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"Fun fact, skinners in early America used to let some of their rabbits go to maggots to eat the maggots. A diet of only lean meat causes some severe issues, but maggots convert that lean meat to fats. The rotted meat isn't safe to eat, but the maggots themselves are fine. I've heard of people just scooping them off and putting them in bread."

The plan is to work here once a week for the remainder of the summer in exchange for a few pounds of shrooms.   I missed snapping a photo of the Oysters! The were so prolific!

He can't afford to pay me at this point, but I do have another job that supports me and also allows for a day off here and there. The main duty we have is picking, picking, picking. Primarily we had Shiitake, but we also had some Maitake, Lion's Mane, and Oyster to pick that day! The way he manages his logs is very intensive for a small producer. Essentially he moves logs in and out of his hoop on a 2 or 3 day cycle. This is all by hand or by a small tractor with a trailer. We had to carry many of those leaning logs out and replace them with fresh logs from outside in the stacked piles. From there we soak the logs to induce a flush of Fungi and as they slow down over a week or so they go back outside. This cycle is continued all summer!  Basically once inoculation is completed in early spring they are left in fields to incubate and are added to the in/out cycle next season.  Fun times: Seeing produce box upon produce box stacked taller than myself (5'5"") loaded with tons of Shrooms. We had a fun time and got to dish on local producers and other Fungi folk and laugh about our experiences that led us to this hobby/profession.  All in all a great time, but I will be honest. This is a labor intensive practice that involves business savvy and relationship skills. I wish you the best of luck! I still have MUCH to learn! Cheers!"

mycology,3de8tu,Scottiequinn,3,Wed Jul 15 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"1) Chanterelle quiche is awesome.  -Take a pound of chanterelles and dry saute them until they drop their water and some of it simmers off, remove from heat.    -Saute 2-3 good-sized shallots and 2 cloves of garlic in 2.5 Tbsp butter then add the chanterelles back to the mix with 2-3 tsp of fresh thyme, add salt and pepper to taste and saute (without stirring too much) for 7-9 minutes until the mushrooms brown on the edges.    -Mix together 2 eggs, 3/4 cup whipping cream    -Put 2 tsp fresh thyme on the bottom of a semi-baked quiche crust (I'm lazy so I use store-bought puff pastry and prebake it for about 10 minutes until it's starting to brown), then add the mushroom/shallot/garlic mixture, then pour the egg/cream mix over the mushrooms    -Add a few tablespoons of tasty cheese (I like havarti and parm) and some sliced green onion    -Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until the top of the quiche is brown    -Eat it.  2) Yes, I preserve my chanterelles for later use. Although lots of people refuse to do so, I slice mine very thin and dry them slowly, then store in mason jars. When I want to revive them, I simmer them gently in water and butter until they are tender again (usually 30 minutes or so, let all the water get simmered in or off the mushrooms), and then I cook em. I also saute and freeze some, but I don't have enough freezer space for all that I end up with at the end of the season!  3) Or you could always find a fancy restaurant or grocery store and sell some of them...

With pork or lamb shanks to braise with.  The way I preserve the chanterelles is to par-cook them in butter and vacuum seal when cool then freeze.  I hope this helps!"
mycology,3dfpqd,Prinsessa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:02 2015 UTC,was it growing in large clusters? I think I may have found this mushroom a week back in Virginia

mycology,3dbxov,Demusp12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:01:52 2015 UTC,Nice!  How do you preserve your chanterelles?  Everything I have been reading has said cook and freeze.
mycology,3dcn5p,Bout_To_Shit_Fuck_Up,3,Wed Jul 15 05:50:23 2015 UTC,Judging on how fragile it looks I'm thinking Russula sp..  Possibly R. decolorans.  I see these nibbles by squirrels all the time.
mycology,3dcn5p,brachiomyback,4,Wed Jul 15 11:21:14 2015 UTC,"The mycology professor I had in undergrad said she thought squirrels were a dispersal mechanism for russulas, since often times they'll pull the mushroom into the crook of a tree and not eat it completely allowing the spores to wind disperse from a great height."

mycology,3d7her,Goliath_Gamer,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:39 2015 UTC,I was in a mycology club for a little while (I moved shortly after to a different state). Every month we received a letter in the mail with a schedule of forays and classes that we could attend for free! They also discussed about what mushrooms they have seen recently and what to expect and just general news about mushrooms. I attended a poisonous mushrooms class that was taught by an author of a local book. He was selling his books at the end of the class and signed them. I'm about to join one here at my new place! Just need to find the time to attend a foray and pay my dues! Have fun!  Edit: stupid autocorrect

mycology,3d4qxo,UncleEggma,2,Mon Jul 13 14:47:23 2015 UTC,I was thinking Cortinarius.  Maybe C. Iodes.  But it's doesn't seem quite the same - especially in the gills.
mycology,3d4qxo,tetrispig,3,Mon Jul 13 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"If it's not C. iodes, then it's C. iodeoides."

mycology,3d4qxo,armchairepicure,3,Mon Jul 13 15:23:30 2015 UTC,The only other possibility is Lepista / Clitocybe nuda. It's easily ruled out by the rusty spore deposits on the remnants of the cortina on the stem. Conditions may have just been a bit too dry for the Cortinarius to be slimy.

mycology,3d2f9b,gingermuffinboy,4,Mon Jul 13 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"They're ok. Definitely worth eating. However, they turn a pretty unappetizing green once cooked though. I've only had them a few times, since they seem to be pretty rare in my area."
mycology,3d2f9b,armchairepicure,2,Mon Jul 13 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"Eooh, green?  Yeah I dunno how I'd feel about that visual.  I mean I don't know what I expected from a blue mushroom now that I think about it."
mycology,3d2f9b,Tankbean,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:06 2015 UTC,Ehhhhh. I don't love the texture and consistency of Lactarius generally (I just cooked up and subsequently tossed out a mess load of Lactifluus volemus because I just couldn't make the texture work for me). And they are of a very mild flavor. But they are unmistakeable and therefore a very good mushroom for a new forager to try.
mycology,3d2f9b,armchairepicure,2,Mon Jul 13 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the ID.  Pretty hard to mistake a blue mushroom.  Have you tried dry sauteing them first to reduce their water content, then adding oil and lightly frying them?  I do this for a lot of mushrooms.  If I'm putting them on pizza, I usually bake them for several minutes at 350F to reduce the water also.  That way there's not a puddle of sogginess on the pizza."
mycology,3d2f9b,washmo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the latex is such an issue. Maybe that'll work for L. indigo, but for species that produce more voluminous latex, you gotta stew them. And even then, they don't cook down to that nice mushroom texture. Maybe I should try pressure cooking..."

mycology,3d2f9b,MushroomAnna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:50:22 2015 UTC,Meh. They are edible.   I have done them 2 ways.    marinated and grilled = not very good  sauteed = ok

mycology,3d2uef,MushroomAnna,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are a few that are toxic. Although there are few ""in general"" rules in mycophagy (fancy-talk for eating wild mushrooms), there are a few bolete rules: 1) No red-pored boletes. A few of them are toxic. 2) No boletes that stain blue. A lot more common than red-pored boletes, a few species of blue-staining boletes have caused people trouble. 3) No boletes with orange caps and scabers on the stalk (google ""Leccinum"" and look at the stem, the scabby, scurfy stuff on the stem are scabers). Leccinums are bolete-type mushrooms and they are generally safe, but one orange-capped species has been reported to make people sick. 4) No boletes that are super-bitter. The genus Tylopilus has some very, very bitter species, as well as some classics in the Boletus genus. If you taste it and it makes you go ICK then it's not edible. Otherwise though, boletes and bolete-type mushrooms (genus Suillus, Leccinum, Austroboletus, and others) are considered safe edibles. I stick with a few that I know and love though, because a lot of them aren't that tasty."

mycology,3d191p,idoescompooters,3,Sun Jul 12 18:08:34 2015 UTC,Consider/test for Amanita amerirubescens.
mycology,3d191p,Auraxicus,2,Sun Jul 12 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"The faint blushing on the stem seems to confirm this. It's actually edible but don't even think about eating it until you have a second opinion from someone knowledgeable examining it physically. I wouldn't worry about the dog though, it's unlikely that it's lethal and have a dog appeal."
mycology,3d191p,thefrisker,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"So I found this in my backyard today in central Virginia. In addition to my curiosity, I've got a dog so I would also like to know some specifics on how lethal it is.  I guess it's good I missed this with my BB gun before I went over to take pictures for ID. Heh"
mycology,3d191p,Auraxicus,2,Sun Jul 12 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"Regardless of which, it's an Amanita and shouldn't be eaten raw (or at all). I would suggest just plucking the mushrooms before you let your dog out. When I do this after they're open, I often impale them on a stick to let them drop some more spores- it's not the fungus' fault really. If it were a A. pantherina or A. section lepidella I'd be very concerned with as little as one mushroom."
mycology,3d191p,Auraxicus,2,Sun Jul 12 18:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well, no mushrooms should ever be eaten raw (besides the very few exceptions). What exactly do you mean by after they're open you impale them and let them drop more spores? And the fungus' fault? Wouldn't I not want the spores to be dropped so more of them don't grow?  And regarding your last statement, what do you mean? I should be very concerned? Because the A. pantherina looks awfully like the one I just posted, and I've seen an A. section lepidella before as wlel."
mycology,3d191p,MushroomAnna,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:33:07 2015 UTC,"The fungus is symbiotic with a tree. Yours isn't going anywhere and all the spores are going to do is land elsewhere and maybe help some (future) tree. I impale them on a dead tree branch or something so they stay gill-side down and exposed to air.  Check for red staining because , in order, I would consider A. amerirubescens, A. pantherina, and after that other Amanita sect. Amanita."

Most are not edible, but there are a few exceptions (Tylopilus indecisus and Tylopilus alboater, for instance). Anyhow, that mushroom expert key should help you sort out which Tylopilus it is."

mycology,3cxyo3,Agenbite_of_inwit,2,Sat Jul 11 21:10:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is why I don't even touch amanitas.  Edit: Are you sure? They are really similar macroscopically. One distinctive feature on A. rubescens are ridges on the ring which my specimen does not seem to have.
mycology,3cxyo3,Agenbite_of_inwit,2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"No.  Pretty sure.  But not certain.  The ""blushing"" seems pretty telling though and would likely disqualify A. pantherina, since it isn't supposed to stain upon exposure.  Another way to approach this:  Are you west of the Rockies?  If so, then you are supposed to be in panther country.  According to Rod Tulloss (the preeminent Amanita expert), Amanita ameripantherina is exclusive to the West coast.  For what it's worth, I've never had the courage to eat the blusher either.  Their resemblance to the panther and to other questionable Amanitas (A. brunnescens for example) creeps me out.  This year I ate some of the American caesar mushrooms (my first culinary experience with genus Amanita, and I forbid my wife from partaking out of fear.  In short, then:  if you're going to misidentify a mushroom, I think you're going about it the right way.  Better to mistake an esculent for a toxic one than the other way around.  I say carry on!"

You are only going to get spore disperal if you can literally see a change in the fruiting body's color, from black to ashy gray. That ashy gray color change is caused by spore maturation on the outside of the fruiting body."

I might try drying some if I'm not going to hurt it by harvesting.

Maybe you can take a few pointers from it. I thought about doing something similar, but the problem is the variety of mushrooms word-wide - you'd need a pretty great interface and community for it to be any use at all, and it would basically have to be a Wiki. That's a really hard task, not only in terms of mycology (you'd need some experts to skim photos etc.) or programming but also law if you take licensing into account.  Edit: DON'T just translate the Danish version! I've seriously misidentified US mushrooms before because I was going off German species and the characteristic delimitations I knew. This would be a real danger if someone from the US or NZ were to use your site - you know how naive some people are when it comes to IDs!"

(Also let me know if you don't intend to do this - I've been interested in the associated technologies for a while now and your post rekindled the Wiki idea, maybe that would be a good reason to finally get a thorough background...)"

An app would be great to use in the field, but I would still pay for a site, even if  I had to wait until I get home for uploading to use. Trying to do an image search on google (to narrow the field) when I have a new find is a pain in the a#*, and field books at times are ambiguous at best."

mycology,3cnmfy,travvo,2,Thu Jul 9 15:25:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed on russula.  Maybe emetica. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russula_emetica  Could be xerampelina too... although I'm used to a darker purple for xerampelina.  For me the smell gives it away.  If it smells distinctly like shrimp or crab, then xerampelina.  Emetica smells nothing like xerampelina.  Sometimes people say that chanterelles smell like fruit and if I smell deeply and close my eyes, I can visualize something that smells vaguely like peaches or apricots.  But a shrimp russula isn't like that - it smells absolutely the same (to me) as a bowl full of fresh shrimp and no imagination is needed.  I agree with travvo.  Be careful on the ID if you plan on eating them because those look more like emetica (""the sickener"") than xerampelina (""shrimp russula"") to me."
mycology,3cnmfy,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"I agree it could be a russula, but how can you tell it isn't a lactarius without seeing if it bleeds?  Are there some other obvious distinguishing features to tell them apart?"
mycology,3cnmfy,Moj88,2,Thu Jul 9 22:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point.  The depressions in the cap could be lactarius...  For me, here in Colorado, that blindingly perfectly smooth white stem lead to a red cap like those shown in the photos would be a russula because they are very common here and the look like the photos.  But looking at them the cap does lead to a depression and in the one in the lower right it seems to go hollow like a lactarius... but around here we have no lactarius that are red with a white stem... all of ours are orange or yellow.  So perhaps I jumped to what is common in Colorado and maybe they have red capped, white stemmed lactarius in Alabama...   But, I agree with the heart of your point which is that we are guessing.  For a really good ID we all need to see a cross-section (to see if it's hollow and bleeds or solid white like a russula), a shot of the gills, and ideally a spore print, and perhaps a good smell analysis as well."

mycology,3cjo5p,PatapscoMike,3,Wed Jul 8 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"How can you tell without a spore print, I thought the only difference was a green vs white print."
mycology,3cjo5p,Moj88,5,Wed Jul 8 18:27:51 2015 UTC,Marasmius oreades looks nothing like C. molybdites. The difference between C. molybdites and C. rhacodes is more subtle and has a lot to do with habitat. Usually C. molybdites grows in lawns while C. rhacodes grows in disturbed ground usually in forests near conifers. Also in my experience C. molybdites is lighter than C. rhacodes. The spore print is the definitive way to differentiate them.
mycology,3cjo5p,Moj88,2,Wed Jul 8 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure why anyone would think these are M. oreades, I thought from the post title they were ID's as C. rhacodes...  I think you are right about these being false parasols though (from just looking casually at the pic)."
mycology,3cjo5p,MrM0stly,3,Wed Jul 8 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"M. oreades is the ""fairy ring mushroom"".  However, OP wasn't calling this a ""fairy ring mushroom"".  Najjex misread the title.    This is the difference that I used to distinguish the C. Molybdites in the picture and parasol mushrooms (macrolepiota procera) that OP thought it was: According to the source I am using, C. Molybdites has broad buff scales over center while parasols have a broad, brownish, densely scaley, knobbed cap.  Do a google image search for both, and you will see the mushroom posted here looks slightly more like C. Molybdites."

mycology,3ckblb,armchairepicure,3,Wed Jul 8 18:01:16 2015 UTC,"Bruising is a very handy ID tool when observing a new specimen. It is achieved by handling the mushroom with enough pressure to ""bruise"" the mushroom's flesh. This amount of pressure varies from species to species. For example, in some Boletes (pored, stemmed mushrooms in general, they all have different names now), all you need to do is lightly press your thumb onto the pores and you will leave a blue thumbprint.  For some little brown mushrooms, bruising is a crucial macro feature in determining the genus and species. But, there are a number of macrofeatures in this photo that give me clues as to why these mushrooms won't bruise blue.  The primary of which is how clustered these guys are. Another are the slightly umbonate caps (like a nipple - hehe!), that they are viscid (slimy), and that they have concentric zones of color even while viscid. I'm gonna make a bet that there used to be a tree or bush here and that these are an Armillaria sp."

mycology,3chheg,Kgquari,13,Wed Jul 8 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"Two spores land in a spot and fuse nuclei, forming an 'adult'(reproductively capable) fungus. That fungus grows outwards and produces mushrooms at the edge of its territory. The tendency to produce mushrooms at the edges of growth and the tendency to grow evenly, radially, determine different species frequency of this phenomenon.  This looks like Chlorophyllum which commonly do this. When I find Marasmius oreades they are almost always in rings, of varying regularity."
mycology,3chheg,Auraxicus,5,Wed Jul 8 02:17:34 2015 UTC,NO IT'S FAIRIES SHUT UP
mycology,3chheg,pisio,3,Wed Jul 8 13:51:27 2015 UTC,interesting...  on further reading it seems the center of the mycillial growth will die when the organic matter it was eating is used up- leaving a ring of mycellium underground as well as fruiting bodies above.
mycology,3chheg,mushroom4improvement,2,Wed Jul 8 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"I have plenty of pictures of this. You can spot that form of 'fairy ring' (which won't require mushrooms to be grown at the growth front) as grass that grows taller or greener in a ring.   Sometimes you'll see dead grass in the middle too but I think that's a different phenomenon from what you described, or a separate artifact of it."
mycology,3chheg,Auraxicus,3,Wed Jul 8 02:56:29 2015 UTC,Definitely greener in the middle of this one. Even with no mushrooms fruiting.

mycology,3chheg,Auraxicus,6,Wed Jul 8 02:10:03 2015 UTC,Not quite- check out my answer above.   Wind-blown spores are much wider in distribution (miles) and more irregular than a few inches or meters in all directions. The reason fungi aren't everywhere is that it often takes the landing of two spores near to eachother to form a mushroom-producing fungus.

A lot of the mushrooms that I have found have holes in the stem (I'm assuming from worms), with the exception of very young mushrooms. How do you go about checking for bugs? Is there a way to get the bugs out? Or do you just have to pick them until you find one that isn't infested with bugs?   Edit: Just did a quick search and found THIS. TL/DR: They cut off the very bad parts and soak the remaining good parts in salt water for a couple minutes. Is this what you do?"

My thought is that the color change is due to the fruit aborting, and the fruit is aborting because of some environmental condition it doesnt like. not a great answer, but hey.  what are  your conditions? air exchange and humidity? did it get really cold at any time?  In my experience, pink oysters put up with alot of abuse - but one thing they dont like is cold. putting a pink oyster culture in the fridge will kill it, for example.   i did something similar to that block you have before but, as u/knotheadToo suggested, i let it fully colonize before i introduced it to fruiting. here is a crappy picture  http://imgur.com/kgHRkNa almost all the pins fully matured, although the fruits were small.   as far as them taking abuse, here is a block fruiting that I had thrown in a pile of compost and forgot about:http://i.imgur.com/ctGtl73.jpg good luck with your grow!

mycology,3cjpgg,UncleEggma,2,Wed Jul 8 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty Lactarius (probably).  Cutting the gills on these guys helps alot (to see the latex), also a good sniff or two.   Maybe a Bondarzewia berkeleyi.  They grow off trees roots rather than the trunk, making it look terrestrial.  It looks more white than ones I have found, but it's a good place to start looking around. That is a fruiting body (maybe Boletus) that is being attacked by a mold. Yeah, the underside shot would be useful.  Could be Stereum. Those are chanterelles! Those puffballs look weird.  Did you cut any open? Definitely Amanita, maybe A. gemmata.  Regardless, it is a poisonous species. It's an old Russula, maybe R. laurocerasi or something similar. Doesn't look hairy enough for L. pubescens.  Maybe L. subvellerius if that is latex showing.  If not, Russula brevipes.   Maybe, but it's long gone. Looks the same as 8, R. laurocerasi. I think this one is the most interesting.  The pink gills and partial veil put my idea into Agaricus.  Might be this one.   Thanks for bringing some good stuff!"
mycology,3cjpgg,jastermareel17,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"#2. Thank you!  I'm convinced it's Bondarzewia berkeleyi as it was growing on the roots, like you said.  And pictures online look very similar.  #6.  Yeah - they were all white and very moist.  Pretty much the same inside and out.  They were growing very close to #7.  What makes them look weird for puff balls?  #7.  Hmm - your suggestion led me to Amanita russuloides which I now think is the correct ID.  Really picturesque mushrooms.  #9. I am confused by what 'latex' is in your comments.  Is it the milky liquid that these mushrooms bleed?  I took the stalk off of this one and #1 and they released a very milky substance.  Interesting that L. Subvellereus is so similar to Russula Brevipes - but it did bleed milky.  #10. Old old man of the woods, then.  #12.  Geez you are good at this!  I'd put my money on your A. pocillator.  Thanks for all of your help!"
mycology,3cjpgg,jastermareel17,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:50 2015 UTC,"No problem!  The more you know...  To me, those puff balls looked like they could be Amanita 'eggs'.  If there was no visible 'baby' mushroom outline inside, they were probably puffballs, a Calvatia sp.  ""Latex"" is just the term for the liquid stuff that comes out of Lactarius mushrooms (Lac is latin for milk).  It is an important characteristic to observe when you have these mushrooms in hand.  Color (or change in color), staining and even taste of the latex.  What I would look for in the one you had would be a large amount of white latex and if it stained the gills (and often your hands) brown.  That accompanied with a fish-y smell and you've got L. volemous, very delicious.  Just keep reading and searching!"

mycology,3cjpgg,Moj88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  That's a good suggestion, but I am still leaning towards A. Russuloides.  The ones I found have very few warts."
mycology,3cjpgg,Moj88,2,Fri Jul 10 13:54:26 2015 UTC,That may not be a good distinguishing characteristic.  I've seen a number of pictures of A. Multisquamosa that range from few to many warts.    Has it been raining in your area?  The warts may be washing off.

mycology,3ch7eg,Spawny7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"I'm new to mycology too.  My wife joined a mycological association too and we will have group forages.  I've been a handful of them, and there is always someone there that can identify or at least give a lot helpful information.    We were interested in edible mushrooms, so we bought some good books and learned how to identify distinguishing features.  I have an app (Audobon Mushrooms); it doesn't have everything, but it is helpful when you are outside.  We started with the easy stuff, which gave us a way to participate before being an expert.  Mushrooms like chicken of the woods, hen of the woods, and morels are all edible without many dangerous look-alikes.  Boletes are pretty easy to identify because they have pores under their cap.  There are no deadly boletes and many edible types, and they are in season right now.  Also, learn how to identify death caps and destroying angels, which are said to be responsible for most deaths.  Always cook the mushrooms you plan to eat.  Always side on caution; if you aren't sure don't eat it.  When you do, start with small amounts; you can still react poorly to edible mushrooms that are otherwise fine for most people.  Eventually you will pick up enough information that you will begin to feel comfortable in being able to identify more and more mushrooms."

mycology,3cdyxa,zipzipzap,8,Tue Jul 7 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"I should clarify, although it's been there a while, its more visible growth (from a small pinhead to maturity) is longer than the from spore to pinning. The spores of that mushroom could have been there for a week if not a few weeks waiting for the right conditions.   Also since Jack in the Box is a business and wants to keep business, they'll make the store comfortable. What I'm getting at is that the restaurant probably has fairly low humidity and temperatures probably right around 70 degrees. These two things prevent mushrooms from growing at full speed and lengthen the overall growing period.  Anyway Jack in the Box is gross."

mycology,3cdwos,sk84life0129,4,Tue Jul 7 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it looks like Alabama only has one club, in the north of the state. Other good places to look for fellow enthusiasts include the biology departments of your local universities.  If you have to go it alone, it's harder but you can make it work. Pick up a field guide or two, hit the woods, and try to follow the keys to ID what you find. Post (good!) pictures, your IDs, and how you got there here or on another online mushroom forum. Someone should be able to tell you if you're on the right track."
mycology,3cdwos,mave_of_wutilation,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:11:17 2015 UTC,"I also am a beginner, and hate to keep pestering for ID's.  I have the ""audubon field guide to north american mushrooms"" on my phone, but it disappoints- often.    Are there better guides out there, aimed at the absolute beginner? preferably a phone app so it will be with you at all times?    (just an example, if anyone is actually curious. I found an intriguing red mushroom in my tiny forest the other day, and began looking to ID it.  I noticed it had a green yellow underside with pores not gills, and I had never seen a mushroom like this before.   So i go to the Audubon guide. I have learned what a polypore is in the last few months, but i knew nothing of boletes.  I hit ""browse by shape"" and it has basic silhouettes, and species names. none of the stalked mushroom pics seemed to work, so i chose ""stalked polypores"" and went search through lots of pictures.  didn't find what i needed. This happens a lot.  So i hit the web, figure out that boletes have pores (like i said, absolute beginner) and hit the audubon guide again knowing the genus. This time i find some potentials, and i suspect it was a ""two color bolete"" but i am still not very sure. there are few pictures, and the written descriptions are somewhat daunting to newcomers.   Are there better guides out there? or at least beginner guides to train on until i learn more and the audubon guide is more useful?"
mycology,3cdwos,KazenDei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"Asking for IDs can be obnoxious, but only if the poster makes clear they've put very little effort into it. I don't think anyone's going to be bothered by requests that talk about having tried to key out the mushroom.  Your Boletus bicolor example plus pictures would be a great post. Of course, there are about a zillion boletes that look a lot like B. bicolor, but you can't win them all :)"

The Audubon is good.  I think another of comparable quality, Mushrooms of North America by Orson K. Miller is the one I learned on.  Having two different keys, and better two people arrive at the same ID is pretty reasuring.  If you get Miller get the paperback, easy to cram in a pocket or daypack.

What others have said I agree with entirely. Get a couple of good field guides and learn to use them, yeah the learning curve is steep at first, but we don't want to go into the other alternative.  When you get a feel for how the ""bifucated key"" structure of the guides set about first on an intensive study of what you do not want to pick.""  You should be able to easily recognise the genus Amanita.  If you have any intention to explore the informal group often reffered to a LBM's, little brown mushrooms, you need to know about the genus Galerina.  I had formal training in microbiology, mostly clinical bacteriology when I got into wild picking of mushrooms, so I was already familiar with the bifurcated key thing.  I was also hanging out with a local Biology prof from the local Community College, we proceeded with great caution but found great rewards.  Consider dropping in to the local Community College and asking around, there may well be an informal group that don't consider themselves to be a club."

mycology,3ce9ns,hookahrino,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"In the very early development of an Amanita, and in fact many other types of mushrooms too, the entire structure is encased in a membranous ""universal veil.""  The warts on the cap are the torn apart remnants of that veil, as is the persistant ring around the stem.  Function? Evolution does not always address function.  In some, another structure, the volva, remains like a little membranous cup in the soil that the mushroom grows out of.  This one should be taken as a serious warning that you may be looking at A. phaloides or A. virosa which are just about as deadly poison as a mushroom gets.  In A. muscaria there is no volva but a series of rough rings around the base of the stem mark the place where that veil was attached there.  Personally, I wouldn't eat any North American Amanita.  So, TIL that I'm not the only one that got started on Psilocybes but whose interest spread into the other members of the Fifth Kingdom."

The vast, vast majority of more complex fungi such as mushrooms and cup fungi are benign at worst for garden plants, or more likely beneficial since they break down dead matter in the soil and make nutrients available to plants again. Much more uncommon parasitic mushrooms such as armillaria mellea and Trametes hispida tend to be parasitic on woody plant tissue, and what you have in your picture is neither of these.

All the genetics work puts them as a very different species. This is currently a big issue in mycology in China. Most of the mushrooms are called by whatever looks most similar to them from Europe, but rarely do they actually belong to the same species.  Extra fun fact.

Although I think rodents don't take to destroying angels and the like. Deer are known to seek out A. muscaria for their intoxicating effects, and they aren't horrible for humans either. Less uncomfortable if you get rid of the (I think) ibotenic acid. Or maybe it's the muscarine, but that's usually low enough to not cause any issues."

It's a truly fun game with good artwork and simple-to-learn but deep game mechanics. This game is highly touted by many board game fans who aren't interested in mushrooms, so if you already like mushrooms it'd be especially fun.   The game simulates a walk through the forest as you try to collect like mushrooms so that you can either sell or cook them. Each turn you have new mushrooms available to you that are along the path. Those you don't pick up go into the ""decay"". You have to watch out for Destroying Angels! Also keep butter or apple cider handy to boost the amount of points you get from cooking like mushrooms.   I'm in no way associated with this game, I just really enjoy it and thought those of you who haven't heard of it would at least like to read up on it."

We surfers do see the conflict inherent in riding waves on noxious slabs of weird materials, but this has a long way to go.  They acknowledge that there is currently a 30% (!) success rate, and that boards are ""a couple"" of pounds too heavy to be competitive.  That is tough when boards really only weight ""a couple"" of pounds.  Not to mention the strength and flex characteristics of this material.  And they cost three times what a top of the line board would!  I'm just trying to talk myself out of being too excited about this, but I hope they keep working."

Interestingly it is the equivalent of a check. You write a check to someone instead of handing them $2,000 in cash because its easier. You hand someone a $5 note vs a bar of silver because its easier)  Unfortunately the US does not have enough gold and silver to back all currency, so that was done away with.

Add it to a cream sauce, a light stir fry, use it in a hash or top some steak with them.  On the steak note, you can dry out the stems, pulverize them and add it to a dry rub (usually salt and pepper for me).

I have never seen anything like this before.   We are 2,100 feet elevation.   The soil in my garden consists of lasagna layers with coffee wood branches on the bottom, green leaves, and macadamia nut husks, dried fruit tree leaves, shredded coffee branches, compost and a bit of organic potting soil. There are also various fruit tree twigs as well.   These are no larger than a nickel in size and were just above the soil line with one small one under the soil line.   The outside feels slightly hard with the inside gelatinous. They were found like this with the tops open showing this strange membrane like inside.   No distinct smell other than a faint musty scent. That might just be the soil though.   I was surprised to see they had a decent root base when I dug them up.   We have been recieving severe rains and in the last 24 hours that these appeared we have gotten 2"" of rain.   Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

mycology,3bjwze,Mycoholic91,2,Mon Jun 29 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry - what I mean by that is - with fungi, morphologically the sexual stage and asexual stage can be very distinct. Because of this, the same fungus may have multiple names dependent on the stage it's in - we've only recently (in the last decade) figured out that, for example, Giberrella (Sexual) and Nectri (Sexual) and Fusarium (Asexual) are all the same thing. With the onset of molecular data, we've been able to amplify multiple gene regions that tell us how closely related these organisms actually are - which also means we have to figure out one name for the genus - for example, there's a heavy argument supporting the use of Fusarium instead of Giberrella and Nectria, among others. Does this make sense - I sometimes struggle at explaining this.   I'm actually a PhD student studying human and animal fungal diseases - so I guess you could say I'm ""training"" to be an authority on the subject...that's the goal one day :) haha"
mycology,3bik7x,Boogens1990,2,Mon Jun 29 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you aren't growing psychedelics, even though this post smells fishy...   You don't need to keep it heated. Heating doesn't really speed up times. Check out Paul Stamets book Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms. He has temperatures and instructions for pretty much any legal mushroom you can grow. If it isn't in there, it probably isn't commonly grown, is illegal, or it just newly cultivated. For example, I never incubated my Stropharia or my Pleurotus. If it doesn't smell like mushroom, its probably gone bad. If its wet, then something was really bad. I am guessing the bag wasn't made correctly to begin with. By wet I mean soaking wet. It should be damp and the bag should show signs of humidity, but it shouldn't be soaked.   A premade bag of grain on ebay goes for less than 20 bucks, as does a syringe of liquid mycellium or spores. Do a little bit more research and stick to the gourmet section on Shroomery, that is the only section of that site where you will get decent information."

mycology,3bfafc,sativan,4,Sun Jun 28 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"The growth pattern, substrate, and conditions are spot on, but the coloration is all wrong. Now, I was under the impression that there are no lookalikes for oysters in the USA (or the northern hemisphere for that matter). If these have gills that run all the way down the stem/to the bark from which they came and they smell like anise then I would be confident that they are oysters. I find that the oysters which grow near me (northern NJ) vary quite a bit in color, size, and growth pattern."

mycology,3bg27e,NorCalMisfit,2,Sun Jun 28 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"The main reason restaurants and grocery stores pay so much for gourmet (read: wild) mushrooms, is because they're nearly impossible to grow. Chanterelles, morels, etc. all grow in hard-to-replicate symbiotic relationships with trees/plants and microorganisms, meaning that they have to be foraged. Some have specific environmental requirements too.   You can grow other edibles at home from spawn or bricks, maybe make a shiitake log. However, you might have trouble doing it for business because of upfront materials costs for a lowish yield size at least in terms of what a restaurant would buy (idk how big you wanted your grow op to be or what your contacts would want though, so it's probably worth a call). I'm growing some oysters at home now and it's really cheap, but they won't get you gourmet prices since you can find them in a lot of stores.   With respect to your question about a one man operation: a lot of sellers are individual mushroomers with the best foraging spots. I would say start out growing something just for fun and see where it takes you."

Shiitakes aren't uncommon, but here's a link to what goes into farming them: http://www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/316t8j/shiitake_101/   You could try Lion's Mane. You can get ready-to-fruit bricks online for not that much. I haven't seen them in restaurants so if you have creative chef friends, they might want to give it a shot.   Definitely go out and look around too."

Not to mention that it looks like a fairly shaded wooded setting.  Silver maples like to be a bit more exposed, sugar maples are woodland trees, able to grow up under dense canopies.  Silver maple bark reminds me of red maple bark usually.  There's no where near enough detail to distinguish between norway and sugar maple definitively.  Easiest way would be from the samaras.  If really out in the woods I would expect it to be more likely a sugar maple, but I would expect one of that size to have bark that was more ""platy"".  That bark looks closer to Norway to me, and this could be in someone's back yard"

mycology,3b02id,Auraxicus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"Found two of these things, growing within a foot or two of each other. My phone's camera quality isn't the best, so the lighting/color may be difficult to make out, but the majority of the mushroom - cap, stem, and all - is a cream-ish color, almost bordering between a very light yellow and a very light brown. The top of the mushroom has a brown-ish ""sun tan"", of sorts. It feels kind of rubbery to the touch, and it's very brittle - it didn't take much to break the cap of one of the mushrooms in half. It doesn't look like it was fully mature, since the gills weren't exposed, yet, but there WERE gills on the inside of the cap ""bulb"", and they were more-or-less the same color as everything else. In that regard, I doubt that I'd be able to obtain a spore print.  As for where I found it, habitat-wise, it was growing on a small hill along the border of the yard, in the grass. I've never seen anything like it, before, especially not growing in Iowa (used to Pans, tbh), and it's probably not edible (wouldn't trust my identification skills enough to eat it, anyway), but I am curious as to what it may be.  Any help appreciated.  EDIT #1: Just noticed the baby slug. <3  EDIT #2: Just cut one of the stems in half. Middle of the stem was dramatically different than everything else - a sort of deep yellow, kind of like urine, if I'm going to be honest. Looks like it has layers, too."

Parasitic nematodes possess needlelike mouth parts capable of drawing out the contents of a mushroom cell. The mouth of the saprophytic nematode is built for chewing. Saprophytic (free-living) nematodes ingest bacteria, protozoa, and fungal spores, but do not attack the mushroom mycelium.

I'm reading that P. candolleana has white gills when they first come out (which later turn gray/brown), but would they be as pale as the first mushroom that early on too?

mycology,3aug0m,Auraxicus,3,Tue Jun 23 16:47:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure both are Psathyrella and they could easily both be ~P. candolleana. The cap color is variable by maturity and by moisture during development but the gills should reliably be ~white before sporulation. The only reason the gills darken as it matures is that the spores it makes are colored and that they then cover the gills (and your hands).  Spore prints are always handy but if you were to try to print the first mushroom you might not get much of anything as it isn't sporulating yet.

Make shelves out of window screening. Put a small red heat lamp and and some holes arou d the bottom then cut another hole near the top and mount in a cheap bathroom exaust fan . Under $100 bucks total. You can place pegs for shelving and adjust them to fit your need.

I'd first like to apologise for the awful quality of photographs - I didn't plan on submitting this to reddit and had no idea of the rules required for submission, but thought a biologist friend of mine would be able to identify it. She referred me here.  The location is Newcastle, Australia. This was taken at the base of a gun tree in a pretty sparse grassy park (note the chain around the tree preventing vandals/thieves stealing a picnic table).  The shape was convex, but I didn't get a great look at the gills or spores. I will try to take more photographs tomorrow. The tree is a gum tree (I think).   It was found today, in Winter here in Australia.   I'm going to go to the library tomorrow after work to try and find catalogues of mushrooms."

mycology,3an6te,Valahar81,2,Mon Jun 22 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"As I said in another post, I suspect these are Coprinellus micaceus. The color of the caps and the white powdery remnants of the universal veil on the tops of the caps are both strong signs suggesting this. You can also tell that they're coprinoid mushrooms from the darkness at the very edges of the caps; this is the mushrooms' caps starting to dissolve (or ""deliquesce""), which is a common aspect among coprinoid species. This is why they're often called ""inky caps;"" the caps essentially turn into ink as they age."

Convergent evolution results in totally unrelated species having similar structure and function. It wouldn't make sense to categorize marine species based on their fins, right?    To clarify who descending from who, biologists are now constructing lineages based on a few common genetic markers. This makes it less arbitrary/subjective. In reality there's still some fuzziness over which genetic markers to use and how to construct the lineage exactly. This is seen in the going back and forth of Craterellus, where species have been separated out, lumped back, and separated back out again over the past decade according to different ""DNA studies."""

mycology,3advzp,AnEnzymaticBoom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"Bioluminescence is the enzymatic production of light in living organisms. Generally, an enzyme termed luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of a small molecule called luciferin, the product being an excited state molecule, as it decays to ground state a photon is released.   Only within the last few months have the identities of these molecular players become known to science. The structure of the fungal luciferin was solved by researchers from Russia and Japan, the luciferin precursor is hispidin and the actual luciferin is 3-hydroxyhispidin. With the structure of the luciferin known, the identities of the proteins involved and their corresponding genes will surely be known soon.  Ref: Purtov et al. 2015.

mycology,3advzp,EarthDragonComatus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"Well, can you think of another reason why there should be bioluminescent fungi?"
mycology,3advzp,AnEnzymaticBoom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"So, bioluminescence has evolved in extant (still living) species like 40 times in all of life. In general, when you look at these 40 or so different systems the luciferins look like they are antioxidants, which have roles in Reactive Oxygen Species degradation. Normally in ROS cleanup a lot of energy is ""wasted"" and given off as heat. Heat can be just as bad to cells as the ROSs themselves (which are toxic and cause aging and nasty stuff like that). So, the light might be nothing more than a healthier (at the cellular level) alternative to heat.   Now lets consider mushroom spore dispersal in general. Mushrooms are horrible fucking parents. Way worse than plants... They produce MILLIONS of spores, sometimes in a night, and just drop them. But these spores are small and can drift away in the tiniest of air currents. Even in air that we would consider ""still"" there are still micro currents called Brownian motion, just with this spores can travel about 1 meter from the mushroom. When you throw in a small gust, the spores are dispersed.   Now, I can tell you this for a fact. Cockroaches eat the fuck out of these mushrooms at night. So, the mushroom caps, with their spore producing basidia, are getting eaten by insects. Now sure the insects could be pooping out viable spores (but wind disperses them quite well anyway), but now the mushroom if any part of it survives is not producing anymore spores. The reproductive structure is getting eaten, and mushrooms go with the strategy of producing as many propogules as possible, making your reproductive structure noticeable to predators might not be the best strategy.  There might also be some evidence that BL is not good for the mushrooms at some level. Once BL evolved in mushrooms, not all of the offspring from that event retained the trait. In fact if you look at the phylogeny tree of fungal BL, it looks like there were numerous events that silenced the trait, and then numerous events where the trait came back, and then silenced... etc etc.  So... attracting spore disperses might be an advantage of BL, but it might not be the only advantage of BL. At the same time there might be many reasons why BL in fungi is not a good thing.  There is likely a complex balancing act of the trait, and some mushrooms (especially the bigger ones) benefit from being bioluminescent, while other smaller mushrooms might have a harder time...  Hopefully the researcher who is studying the ecology of these things will get off his lazy ass and sit down behind the computer and watch the IR video of the mushroom insect ecological niche and then do the statistics necessary to say something and then publish... I have a feeling he is procrastinating on reddit as we speak... but this is only a guess."

Features used for identifying this little brown mushroom include its distinctive umbonate cap (it traditionally has that little ""nipple"" on top), that it is hygrophanous (it has a color change cap, its colors change when it is wet and as it dries), its striate cap margin (this means that it has vertical lines all along the cap edge), which lifts up and is wavy with age. It also has cream colored, crowded gills in youth, which turn dark-violet-brown with age. When handled, it may bruise bluish.  P. subaeruginosa is not a choice edible because it contains psilocybin and psilocin, thus making it psychoactive.   Now.

mycology,3achuw,Auraxicus,3,Fri Jun 19 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"'poison' is a really broad term. Everything you have ever eaten contained 'poisons' of different kinds, and every chemical interacts with different parts of your body differently. Psilocin/psilocybin are generally considered to be acute poisons that affect you strongly for a short time without significant (noticeable, scientifically demonstrated) lasting damage.  Psilocin mimics neurotransmitters your body uses naturally, and in mimicking them interferes with those systems until your body eliminates them and regains homeostasis.  They're called 'poisonous' not because they can kill you or damage organs (liver and kidneys are common victims of fungal toxins), but because they temporarily impair your body and minds normal functions. I had a friend who fell out of a tree while under the influence. He likely wouldn't have fallen (or been in the tree to begin with) if he weren't intoxicated."

mycology,3ac62x,AlanRockefeller,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"One thing that helps the spores not to move is to use the minimum amount of water you possibly can.   Another is to press down firmly on the cover slip (with a paper towel or something so you don't leave a big thumbprint on it).   If you still have issues with moving spores, painting around the edge of the cover slip with nail polish will take care of it - that way there is nowhere for the water to go."
mycology,3acu24,sk84life0129,2,Fri Jun 19 01:54:18 2015 UTC,Megacollybia sp. Spore print should be whitish. Leccinum scabrum if found under birch.

mycology,3a853j,talaeus,25,Wed Jun 17 23:50:53 2015 UTC,I am betting that this is in someone's back yard.  Perhaps buried spent substrate or spent cakes in the ground.  Not that I would know exactly what such a thing would look like.  loads of great research is being done with these for myco remediation from what I understand.  Doesn't Paul Stamets hold a bunch of IP about using these for toxic cleanups?  It's not just oyster mushrooms that work well.

mycology,3a853j,bubblerboy18,4,Thu Jun 18 10:59:30 2015 UTC,Is that a sign that these are non-friendly/poisonous mushrooms if they leave a stain and bruise blue?
mycology,3a853j,Sinsley,11,Thu Jun 18 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, staining can mean a number of things across a number of species, and it isn't a physical stain on you, it is a color that the flesh of the mushroom turns when exposed to air or pressure.   Staining in Agaricus, for example, can help indicate edibility (staining red versus staining yellow versus no staining at all), staining in little brown mushrooms (in this instance, blue) can help distinguish among numerous, similar looking genus and species, staining in Boletus may simply help narrow down species.  Think of staining as one of a litany of things you can check when determining a specimen's species."
mycology,3a853j,armchairepicure,3,Thu Jun 18 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"If you were to eat these thinking they were a for-the-table edible you would be 'poisoned' technically, as it would impair normal function."

mycology,3a853j,EarthDragonComatus,0,Thu Jun 18 22:30:55 2015 UTC,No it means it may be psychoactive.
mycology,3a853j,bubblerboy18,9,Thu Jun 18 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is incorrect.  Blue staining means different things in different mushrooms. Or, in other words, not all blue staining mushrooms are psychoactive. Some mycena stain blue. Obviously so do some Boletus. And to an inexperienced forager, Lactarius indigo might be confused as blue staining (but come to no harm).  Furthermore, there are a number of psychoactive species that do not stain blue at all. Gymnopilus junonius frequently does not stain. G. luteus actually stains brown! And even some classic Psilocybe species won't bruise, like P. semilenceata, stunzii, fimemtarias, and baeocyatis.  Which is why it is CRUCIAL to be able to identify other macrofeatures, seasonality, and habitat requirements/preferences when making an ID."

I'm fascinated by mushrooms of all kinds, and appreciate the unique characteristics of all kinds, so I find it fascinating when a certain kind is psychoactive, or toxic, or ugly-as-hell but counter-intuitively delicious. So I don't look down on submissions of the ""magic"" kind, but to outsiders it changes our image from a bunch of nerds who find mushrooms interesting to a bunch of psychonauts trying to make it easier to identify in the wild the kind we're looking for.

mycology,3a9vz6,najjex,3,Thu Jun 18 14:51:41 2015 UTC,Why do you think it can't be a Parasola sp.? The only way to get a solid ID would be through microscopy.
mycology,3a9vz6,TheShroomLover,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah a microscopic spore analysis would be the way to go, but I don't think they are Parasola sp. cause of the way the cap is shaped. Parasola usually keeps an umbrella-like shape through their whole growing process (starting ovate and shifting to convex). I can see some in the back that are not as develop as the cluster in the middle, and even in their younger stage still has that bell shape. My assumption would be that they start ovate and shift into bell shape, just like Coprinellus Impatiens sp. I might be wrong, but also the kind of soil in which grows and their growing behavior. Parasola sp. tends to grow in close clusters one next to the other-one and Impatiens grows separated avoiding close clusters. Again, all this information can't be corroborated unless we get more information on stem size, closer pictures, bell size, and ultimately spore measurements on microscopic level."

In Redwood City (Just south of San Francisco in the peninsula) a mental patient stuffed his piehole with a mushroom he found on the grounds.  He died painfully not long after.  His family is suing.  It was likely a death cap, but nobody knows for sure since it wasn't positively identified.  http://abc7news.com/health/family-blames-health-care-center-for-sons-mushroom-poisoning/310426/  ""She says 24 hours after eating the mushroom, her son began vomiting. Four days later, she pulled him off life support.""  That sounds a lot like Amanita Phalloides descriptions I've read elsewhere.  And I was surprised to learn that a mushroom that I photographed while touring an estate garden in Woodside, CA (Filoli) about 5 years ago was Amanita Phalloides, a death cap mushroom.  Here I thought I'd never seen one, they're probably rare, I have zero luck finding interesting mushrooms, blah blah blah and there it is, right in my photo pile.  I stood right in front of it to take its picture and had no clue.  So if your dog is one of THOSE, yes, it would be a good idea to at least figure out what some of the more common poisonous varieties are, and (if possible) train your dog to eat only what you give him."

Since this is the final stage, the pillow like structure is the fruiting body or aethalium. If your friend caught it earlier (but not to early) it would have been a giant gelatinous yellowish mass which oddly enough is edible (cook it up like scrambled eggs)."

There are some interesting differences in the morphology between European and North American specimens."
mycology,39zv32,The_Trust,7,Tue Jun 16 03:12:38 2015 UTC,"It helps a lot to have a cross-section, but the basic appearance looks like coprinus comatus - which is known as the Shaggy Mane.  They are edible - in fact, we had some for dinner a few weeks ago that we found under a cottonwood by the river.  They are often found in lawns or by the side of a road.  http://www.mushroomexpert.com/coprinus_comatus.html  You would want to make sure that they are not chlorophyllum molydbites by cutting them.  If they are shaggy manes, they should not change color when cut and should be a pearly whitish inside (but can be grey if they are older), if they change color to a dingy brownish red then they are the poisonous chlorophyllum molydbites.  Also with the coprinus species it's best to avoid consuming them with alcohol to avoid a reaction between the two.  If you opt to eat them, I don't think they are especially delicious, but they aren't bad, but they need to be eaten promptly after picking (within the day ideally) or they start to turn into an inky black runny mess.  We sauted them and had a nice meal of the roughly dozen that we picked and I thought the taste was mild but still tasty.  The smaller ones - like those in the photo - are the best."

This is an extremely destructive fungus, but needs very specific environmental conditions to flourish. If you take away one of the conditions that it needs, it will quickly be gone. The easiest way is to install a dehumidifier, and get rid of any wood that it could digest. The biggest factor is always moisture though. Get the water out of the environment.  Another thing to know is that there are no fungi that are toxic due to inhalation or skin contact. Open it up, air it out, dehumidify, and you should be good to go.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpula_lacrymans"

For background, this was a sick/mutated tree that turned out to be two trees that grew into each other with a semi hollow middle. Eventually the city told us it was too big and dangerous so it had to be cut down.   We made some more room in the stump, added soil and flowers, and drilled two holes from the flower bed out to the side so water could drain out. A couple days later this stuff appeared on and surrounding the holes.  It smells bad, a little like fermenting apples and insects are going nuts for it. This is in southwestern Ontario (zone 6a) if that helps at all.  Also, interestingly enough the stump is apparently not so dead anymore. It is starting to create new branches again below the saw line."

This is a great first guide.  Mushrooms Demystified is more of a desk reference. It has over 2,000 species, but does not have color photos of all of them. I would wait to get this one until you are sure you really need it.  There are plenty of books out there, so I'm not being biased to Arora. I also have Mushrooms by Thomas Laessoe. This is more akin to a field guide although it is the size of a medium text book (hard bound). It also has picture for every species (~450) which makes it a nice cross reference for the other two books (NOTE: mushrooms in the field have a nasty habit of not looking like the pictures in the book, so more than one picture can be a good thing).  Also, you can check out Roger Phillips app as another option. To me it's not quite as good as a field guide, but if you always have your phone with you then you always have a guide with you, so it's better than nothing.

They had Vera Evenson from the Denver Botanical Gardens commenting about several mushrooms that were brought in that she had never seen before.  I can't find a link but it was on the radio this morning as I was driving in.  Not helpful in your quest for an ID - although it seems like ChickenOfTheWoods nailed it - but it's neat and relevant.

mycology,396hu0,Mr_Impulse,2,Tue Jun 9 16:36:11 2015 UTC,Nice.  Shared.
mycology,396hu0,chickenofthewoods,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:43:41 2015 UTC,I appreciate that! Thanks!
mycology,396hu0,sativan,2,Wed Jun 10 16:42:27 2015 UTC,Great collection of information.
mycology,3956q6,theshadybird,29,Tue Jun 9 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"Almost definitely chlorophyllum molybdites. I would suggest staying outside with your dog while he goes through what is about to come. Lots of water and be careful, dogs don't understand the pain and may nip. Good luck, friend."
mycology,3956q6,tank_monkey,20,Tue Jun 9 13:45:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the concern! He's doing fine, I was able to dig out almost all of the mushroom from his mouth when he found it and after consulting with my pet hotline,  we stayed up and watched him very closely for the next 2 hours. Right this moment he's sleeping soundly next to me and seems to be having no trouble at all. I think I was able to get enough of the mushroom from him that he actually ate very little and I am super grateful that this ended so well, but man am I gonna rip up every one of the buggers that pop up around here and chuck 'em in the trash!"

mycology,3956q6,Auraxicus,21,Tue Jun 9 18:37:41 2015 UTC,If your white-balance is at all representative it's indeed a 'false parasol'- Chlorophyllum molybdites.
mycology,3956q6,Violets-Are-Blue,28,Tue Jun 9 11:57:37 2015 UTC,"Hey bud, how are you and your dog doing? Give us an update so we know he's OK."

mycology,3956q6,Thecuriouscrow,3,Tue Jun 9 16:53:31 2015 UTC,Yay!! I have a neighbor who lost a dog to mushroom poisoning about a year ago so I'm so glad your little guy is OK. I'm lucky with my Yellow Lab - I take him on all my mushroom hunts and although he loves the walks (especially when there is water near the trail) he is completely uninterested in the mushrooms.
mycology,3956q6,Violets-Are-Blue,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:08:42 2015 UTC,What species did the dog eat? How was it confirmed? Just curious
mycology,3956q6,zuctronic,2,Tue Jun 9 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Last time I was in to get my dogs boostershots they told me that someone one street over from me just lost their dog to mushroom poisoning, but they didn't know the details (The dog was taken to the emergency vet hospital, not to my vet). They were basically telling everyone ""check your yard for mushrooms"".  Sorry, that's a pretty crappy story, I know."
mycology,3956q6,somethink_different,3,Wed Jun 10 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"It's possible your dog isn't sensitive to them, but I wouldn't be eager to test that. Somebody I know ate the tiniest piece of a false parasol last summer (like 1/4 of a dime) because he just wanted to know how it tasted. He said it tasted very good and he was hospitalized the next morning.  P.S. I am relieved that your dog is OK!"
mycology,3956q6,pdxcascadian,2,Tue Jun 9 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"Try to get them in the button stage, before they have a chance to open and drop spores."
mycology,3956q6,Learned_Response,2,Tue Jun 9 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"If he eats anything like that again, and you know it was very recent, force some hydrogen peroxide into his mouth. He'll puke up everything he has sitting in his gut. That's what my vet had me do when my dog munched on a couple amanitas last time we went for Chanterelles."
mycology,3956q6,shingalated,2,Tue Jun 9 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"Many vets no longer recommend this. Instead, take them to the emergency vet if there is one local to you. It's not easy for an inexperienced owner to get a dog to ingest peroxide and the attempt can make matters worse. And the time you're trying to make it happen is time you could be on your way to professional help."

mycology,3956q6,PolyWhats,7,Tue Jun 9 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"just wanted to say that I'm really glad that you had the presence of mind to see what was happening and identify the potential risk.   Not all pet owners are intelligent enough to think about such things.  ""herp derp the dog is eating shrooms maybe he'll get high... lolz""     So... good job not being a moron and caring about your dog like a civilized person.    Oh, don't expect ripping them up to keep them from coming back.  you'll be removing them during the fruiting season for the rest of your time there."

mycology,398y9h,oregoon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:27:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on moisture and rain. If it just rained I would wait at least a few days, but they can take a week+ to get to their full potential."

mycology,396fbk,slLKPirTUEdt2GaSAv0j,2,Tue Jun 9 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"Reishi and Shiitake are commonly used for that, AFAIK. They can be cultivated, though I don't know how hard that is.  But keep in mind that the exact mechanisms are currently unknown, which makes it hard to judge how well your batch is working. And do discuss it with your doctor, just because it's ""natural"" doesn't mean there will be no interactions with other drugs etc."
mycology,396fbk,genitaliban,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"just because it's ""natural"" doesn't mean there will be no interactions with other drugs etc.   Good point. I certainly don't assume that natural equals good. Heck, quite a few mushrooms are toxic.   Even without asking my doctor I know the answer would be no to any kind of inquiries on how something like mushrooms can affect inflammation. Not because they don't believe in it but because there has been so little research (at least outside of cancer) so they can't really with good conscience make any recommendations from it.   A little searching shows that reishi cures everything, at least according to some sources. But I also found in this link (https://books.google.se/books?id=FlrpouUh740C&pg=PA48&hl=en#v=onepage&q=reishi&f=false). It seems to have some interactions with TNF-alpha. If I read it correctly it increases TNF-alpha activity. One of my medications is actually a TNF-alpha inhibitor because I already have too much of that going. So they may not be a good match to combine.   It certainly inspired me to read more. This is fascinating. :)"
mycology,396fbk,WWEVOXSE,2,Tue Jun 9 18:10:54 2015 UTC,You should try taking a cod liver oil supplement or drinking homemade bone broth.
mycology,396fbk,IHaveABiologyDegree,2,Wed Jun 10 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"You should consult your doctor before supplementing your medication with any natural health products.  The doses provided in prescription medication are highly regulated and very precise.  Usually, you are given the right amount to do the job and no more.  Despite what many herbalists will say, inflammation is generally a good thing.  Without it, your body would be overrun by infections and would be unable to heal wounds.  In the case of some auto-immune diseases or cases where inflammation is not desired (e.g. organ transplant), anti-inflammatory drugs are needed, but supplementing them with something containing an unknown dose of a substance with poorly characterized effects is not a good idea."
