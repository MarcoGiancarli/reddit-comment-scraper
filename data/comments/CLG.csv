CLG,3e3336,neofederalist,16,Tue Jul 21 16:12:04 2015 UTC,Thought when I graduated from business school I'd never have to see another SWOT analysis again.
CLG,3e3336,itsShady,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"Someone's got to show off what they learned!  e: Though it is well done, so I guess it works out."
CLG,3e3336,iMelon,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:57 2015 UTC,That's the most use I've gotten out of my education.
CLG,3e3336,itsShady,8,Tue Jul 21 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"As much hate as Zikz gets, his P/B has significantly improved. The Kennen game was a pretty damn good PB phase by first picking two counters to Kennen and having a synergetic comp with it was pretty awesome. Really, since the TL and TSM games mid season he has really shown improvement and great knowledge of what he is doing.  Overall, he gets a lot of hate that isn't deserved. I don't think it will be a threat at all to the team, I actually think it will be a strength if he keeps up what he has been doing."
CLG,3e3336,GRESON2015,5,Tue Jul 21 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"Another thing I'd like to add is how refreshing it is to have POB on this team. POB is not a perfect player by any stretch of the imagination. He has an inconsistent laning phase, and a lot of that is likely due to his occasionally over-aggressive positioning. Ergo, he gets caught out more than he should. The trade-off, though, is having a mid-laner that finds a way to remain largely relevant and a HUUUUGEEE damage threat outside of laning phase and in team-fights. What I like most about POB is that he's not afraid to dive in head first and chunk out multiple members of the enemy team at the expense of his own life.   One thing he is VERY good at doing is dealing the maximum amount of damage that he can throughout team-fights. He doesn't float around the backline afraid to do anything in fear of dying."
CLG,3e3336,Klaud9,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:05:31 2015 UTC,being a damage threat is a product of the champion that you pick not the player that you are. Pobelter's teamfighting has been okay with azir/kog and bad with tf/lulu. I'm not going to be optimistic about him unless he turns out to be the kind of player that makes big plays in the playoffs.
CLG,3e3336,brblifting,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"being a damage threat is a product of the champion that you pick not the player that you are.   A narrow-minded view for sure, and not a good way of analyzing a player's strengths and weaknesses. For example, we saw Link many times get put on high damage champions, but fail to have even the impact that POB has shown."
CLG,3e3336,Klaud9,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:49:17 2015 UTC,"Better players deal more damage with any champion. That's not a product of your style either. Sure your style might dictate your champion picks but better players do more damage with a given champion.  Easyhoon is considered to be a more passive player but he would do more damage than pobelter in any given game on any given champion due to being vastly superior player to him.  Is pobelter an upgrade for link? Lets assume yes, so sure he can be said to be doing more damage but it's not like there aren't 100 other mids out there that would be doing more than pobelter easily."
CLG,3e3336,brblifting,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"There certainly aren't 100 better options for CLG, I can tell you that much. Pobelter has looked a little shaky at times, but overall I think he's been a large improvement over Link. Which is all that the team needs atm."

CLG,3e3336,Klaud9,2,Tue Jul 21 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:   Zion's ability to play carry top-lane champions well pretty much mitigates the need for Xmithie to ever play a squishier, early-game focused jungler. A clear example of one of your team's strengths being able to mitigate one of your team's weaknesses (early game jungle pressure).   2.   We do much better against lower tier teams than top ones.   This doesn't really mean anything except for more CLG tilting/choking dank memes. Every top team plays better against the bottom teams than they do against the other ""top-tier"" teams. That's why they're called ""BOTTOM-tier"" teams and ""TOP-tier"" teams. Ugh. Just look up GV/TL/TiP/TSM' record against each other. They're all comparable or worse than CLG's record against teams equal or above them in the standings. CLG is 3-3 against teams tied or above them in the standings, and honestly, they should have  2-0'd GV and TiP this split except for the fact that we randomly tried to pull out a protect the DL team-comp in those two games. TiP is one-dimensional, and they're randomly benching their most underrated player. GV has some nice cheese, but CLG is a bad match-up for them. They needed some incredible smite steals to beat a baaaad T8 and would have gotten blown out by Dig if not for those same smite steals."
CLG,3e3336,Klaud9,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"A clear example of one of your team's strengths being able to mitigate one of your team's weaknesses   This is true. SSB last season regularly had deficits in the early game, but had enough teamwork that they could consistently overcome it.  That being said, just because you have a way to mitigate your weakness doesn't mean that the weakness isn't there, or tha tyou shouldn't work on it. It's still a weakness of the team. I'm also not advocating for a specific solution to these weaknesses as well. It's just as valid of a response to say ""we should put Zion on more carry top laners, and just let Xmithie support/tank jungle"" as it is to say ""we should work on Xmithie playing Nid and Evelyn.""   Every top team plays better against the bottom teams than they do against the other ""top-tier"" teams   That's not strictly true. Fnatic's record against the best other teams in EU is just as good as their record against the bottom teams. The difference is that Fnatic is the top team in EU, when CLG is just a top team in NA. I do agree with you that CLG matches up pretty well against some of them. The point of bringing up that stat is to keep the discussion grounded. We can't say for sure that CLG is the best team in NA right now. They're probably close, but there's definitely room for debate, and the top teams are close enough that we might be either 1 or 4."
CLG,3e3336,mcwtodman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, what you said is correct, because Fnatic is just so much better than the rest of the competition in EU, where everyone else is just fighting for second place and the chance to avoid having to play Fnatic until the Summer Split finals.   In NA, all of the top teams are actually quite close, and I suspect the playoffs will turn out like the EU spring split playoffs did, where every series goes to a full 5 games. There's just no 1 dominant team in NA this split, and with CLG actually looking like they're improving instead of getting worse towards the end of the season, it will make for a very interesting playoff run."

CLG,3e0h88,Eyyoh,21,Tue Jul 21 02:50:36 2015 UTC,Is Kalista Rend Spellshield-able? If so Doublelift may have missed one key Spell Shield (assuming it was off CD) and had one unnecessary death (the Sneaky 1v5 Triple Kill and near Penta). Overall still a god though.
CLG,3e0h88,recursion8,5,Tue Jul 21 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"it is but there's no animation to rend, it's instant, you basically HAVE to predict, so i wouldn't call it miss since it's impossible to react to.  You have to predict the rend 100% of the time"
CLG,3e0h88,josluivivgar,5,Tue Jul 21 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"There was a discussion on it in one of the other threads for the game.  The consensus was that no one ever successfully spellshields Rend because, as you say, you have to predict before the button is pushed.  A D1 Sivir Main (and no one would lie about that on the internet, right?) said that he has never done it before.  Double is a god."
CLG,3e0h88,Acetylsalicylin,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:07 2015 UTC,if you play kalista often you can get a pretty good read on when she wants to rend. typically its either when she has lethal (hard since sometimes they rend early or late to mindgame) or when a trade is being disengaged (easy since if you hold rend too long u get out of range). also rends that are used for slows are REALLY hard to predict unless its obvious its the only way they will catch you
CLG,3e0h88,yummyjelly,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:49 2015 UTC,You basically have to get it the instant they do it though. Sometimes it's better to just spell shield early and force them to wait on the rend.
CLG,3e0h88,Seraphice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:11:38 2015 UTC,Really only works if its a close fight. An equal kalista will wait for the inevitable spell shield once sivir gets to 30%
CLG,3e0h88,jussnf,14,Tue Jul 21 13:47:55 2015 UTC,I was part of that discussion. Both me and the Sivir main agrees that it's damn near impossible because you have to predict it coming and the enemy doesn't use any other cc during the time for it to work. There's no indication it's going to be used. Kalista can also use rend as a slow so you also have to predict whether it's gonna be used to kill or slow.
CLG,3e0h88,Nefari0uss,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"He spell shielded one rend in lane when they were 2v2 top I think. He was probably looking for sneaky to rend stack a low minion before casting for the reset. That's the only way to ""predict"" a rend and successfully spell shield as far as I know."
CLG,3e0h88,_hober,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"What happened in that specific play was Sneaky had rend stacks in Dlift and Pobelter, but Pob zhonya'd and Sneaky held off on Rend until after zhonyas finished. Doublelift spellshielded during the Zhonyas (normally an ok spellshield considering it's impossible to predict). Had he held the spellshield, he could've completely outplayed Sneaky."

CLG,3e2ujk,hotpotato23,6,Tue Jul 21 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"Easiest group to get out of. Luminosity and CLG should make it out.  CLG in first and Luminosity in 2nd. Nihilum could possibly get an upset to reach second, and elevate is practically a free win with the mess they're in.  If brackets play out like a regular tournament after that, then we should face Liquid which is good, but could end up losing to them from our mistakes of over-rotating and lack of teamplay which we saw from ESWC, if our team didnt fix those issues"
CLG,3e2ujk,ADelicateOrange,5,Tue Jul 21 15:24:57 2015 UTC,Probably best possible draw we could get. We have struggled against LG but we will need to come out #1 in group to avoid c9 assuming they win their group which is highly likely.
CLG,3e2ujk,ThaLemonine,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:34 2015 UTC,best group we could of hoped for. c9 and liquid are really strong tho we should get pass the slumping lumo/nihilum.

Dlift addressed it himself, that whenever they fell behind in laning phase they lost confidence and went donezo. For sure they always knew in the back of their minds that a comeback is possible if they keep focussing, but they weren't able to execute it due to having lost faith. This game was something different. This game SHOWED them, that they actually can. I really really hope that this will help them in any situations when they see themselves behind after laning phase. I guess that's just what they needed. Hopefully it is the confidence boost for future comebacks. I bet Coach Chris is already on it. ;)"

CLG,3e0qh9,Lusol,4,Tue Jul 21 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"Like no offense, i write myself and i know how much time and commitment it takes but this is not a review. Its a nice read if you have no time to see the game and what to know how it roughly went down.   It provides little analysis however, you tell us that they grouped up mid but not why (heavy engage on both teams, dont want to get 4v5d)   I dont know how you are ranked but i think writing reviews of games is only for professionals, because they provide little otherwise.   But if you have fun writing keep on doing it you can only improve! :)"
CLG,3e0qh9,EliahBernick,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. While well written, it seems to me like this piece is just the game in text form, and provides little that the average League player couldn't pick out by watching the game yourself."
CLG,3e0qh9,NoPlansTonight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"The term ""review"" usually describes a more superficial text, not so deep on its analysis, so that's what I choose it. Could be argued some people prefer to use it for the latter though.  I agree it could (and in fact it should) have deeper analysis, as it does provide little. It was the first time I tried to review a game this way, next time I'll be sure to treat it other way.  I'll start to study Journalism next year so this is more of a ""let's try and see what I've got now"", having something to compare myself with in the future. I appreciate the feedback nonetheless, as I think it's one important way to improve."

CLG,3dzf5v,Klaud9,10,Mon Jul 20 20:35:34 2015 UTC,I can't believe CLG hasn't been to Worlds in 3 years. It's time for that to end this season.

CLG,3dzf5v,TakeOutTacos,3,Mon Jul 20 20:09:31 2015 UTC,xd our gol is to get to worlds not win it
CLG,3dzf5v,spirited1,0,Mon Jul 20 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here.  TSM and Epik Gamer were the only teams to ever make top 4 at Worlds.  That was in Season 1 when there were only two regions.  It just isn't going to happen for a Western team.  There are probably 5 or maybe 6 teams who can realistically think they have a shot at winning Worlds right now.  If you're not SKT, EDG, LGD, KOO, KT, CJE, and possibly OMG you really have no shot at winning.    The only reason I even included CJE is because of their series vs SKT in spring.  KT might not even make it there depending on playoffs.  OMG plays about 12 rosters, only 1 of which is actually good.    Realistically it will probably be between EDG, SKT, LGD, and maybe KOO.  If I were CLG I'd be very happy about going to worlds.  Doesn't mean I won't root for them to win if they get there, but it just won't happen."

CLG,3dzf5v,CLG_FAITHAGE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:08 2015 UTC,To be fair our teams being (un)successful has nothing to do with the fans. A trend I notice is that NA teams try to wait for each other to lose rather than improve them selves as a team and win on their terms. The C9 vs CLG game was a great example of how NA should start playing. If both teams keep up that playstyle I can easily see NA having another growth spurt. All you have to do is look at FNC and see what I mean.

CLG,3dzf5v,Haethos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that fans should be realistic and hope for the best anyway.  One of the big problems with CLG the last two years is that:   They make a roster move Fans don't think it's the best move and the team will be average They do well to start a split Fans think they are the best Western team because they have a good record They lose a game to TSM or TL They look worse as playoffs approach They get bounced in last place of playoffs Fans get disappointed and say the team ( who they thought at the beginning was average ) sucks and demand heads roll Rinse, repeat   I'd rather have more realistic expectations so that I'm not let down by a team and players I really like  I would be extremely happy if they won worlds, but they haven't been there in 2 seasons, so hoping they get there and get a good group draw is better than hoping they can beat SKT in a Bo5 and then saying fuck this team if they don't win."
CLG,3dzf5v,IWantToBeTheBoshy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:00 2015 UTC,"I can really see CLG placing top 3 in playoffs but Im not that confident in CLGs ability to win the guantlet and go to worlds that way if needs be, of course this is all dependant on seeding and the bracket.

CLG,3dzr13,CLG_FAITHAGE,16,Tue Jul 21 16:40:45 2015 UTC,For sure it's their best chance.  BUT I still worry that we might lose against TSM or Liquid in a Bo5 and if we have to face them first I don't think we could win.  CLG needs to have an easy first round and they might be able to win the whole thing.
CLG,3dzr13,Ricanking,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:32 2015 UTC,Dont know about former splits but this split im pretty sure they scrim in a bo5 format so thats positive atleast.
CLG,3dzr13,Will_Ozellman,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think that our performance vs TSM or TL will depend on how the first game pans out. If we lose the first game, I think there's a high chance of us being 3-0'd again, but if we win I think we have a chance of winning the Bo5. It's hard to tell, though, since there have been games where CLG looked really good and games where CLG looked kinda shaky."
CLG,3dzr13,hyphenscuttle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I do think that if we won the first game we could win it all pretty easily but that worries me because against TSM or Liquid they might tilt after a loss. They seem to be getting better at controlling their tilt though.
CLG,3dzr13,Ricanking,3,Tue Jul 21 02:14:32 2015 UTC,CLG controlled the tilt super well in the C9 game.
CLG,3dzr13,jcitme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"Neither series is a gimme, in fact, CLG may lose more than half the time. But in terms of comparing this time to all the past times. I've been convinced that clg stood so little chance that I almost didn't want them to win as they'd be an embarrassment on the world stage. This time is very different.  I'll put it this way, if I were a TL or TSM fan I'd be sweating a CLG series pretty damn bad. I'll take our chances this year over literally any time else in their history."
CLG,3dzr13,RobotVandal,8,Tue Jul 21 15:59:39 2015 UTC,Yeah Gravity is so weird. Still doesn't feel like they are a top team for some reason.  When does tip swap support btw?

CLG,3dzr13,PandaCodeRed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was really enjoying watching Gravity but then they got to #1 and I think it was a lot of 'things falling in to place' more so than them being head and shoulders above their competition. They're clearly good, but Keane can't help but play dumb champs.. if they win good for them, not really a waste of a spot at worlds as they clearly deserve it, just.. odd. I can't imagine them doing well against EU or SEA, CN, Korea, but maybe their ability to try new things is what is needed."
CLG,3dzr13,RockyDaGod,0,Tue Jul 21 09:48:31 2015 UTC,"I still think GV is the strongest team in NA, and they will be even stronger in bo5, but we will see.   People had doubts about UOL in a best of 5 last season and they proved everyone wrong.  I think CLG has a pretty good chance if they just avoid tsm."
CLG,3dzr13,TurriPi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:06 2015 UTC,You think GV is going to do will in a Bo5 because they made it to finals last split? I honestly think GV is going to be exposed in playoffs. This BO1 format is the only reason they are at the top of NA right now with Keane's cheese strats.
CLG,3dzr13,CLGbubblelift,5,Tue Jul 21 20:16:20 2015 UTC,"Their best chance was last year Spring with Monte, but yeah since then this has been the most clear."
CLG,3dzr13,Baltej16,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:17 2015 UTC,ya they came on really strong at the end of last spring split and still choked at the end people seem to forget that for some reason. the razor cake is looking pretty damn good  right now though
CLG,3dzr13,Bugbud,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"maybe but spring 2014 is still their best run and even that only got 3rd, don't get your hopes up too high"

That's of course assuming someone tilts in game 1, if they all perform to their respective skill then I can definitely see them winning without subs"

CLG,3dxym6,Jacecool,3,Mon Jul 20 13:34:38 2015 UTC,What are the chances that this happens?   CLG gets 1st GV gets 2nd  TL gets 3rd TIP gets 4th TSM gets 5th Dig gets 6th  Is this the only way it happens?

CLG,3dxym6,tallGuy66,5,Mon Jul 20 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"It's a tournament to find out who gets the 3rd ticket to worlds. 1st place in playoffs gets a freebie, followed by the team with the most circuit points. Then the 2nd-5th place teams (by circuit points) have the regional qualifier."
CLG,3dxym6,DiggyB,3,Mon Jul 20 16:46:30 2015 UTC,"Ahhh awesome, so a four team turni after the playoffs to decide. Thank you!!!  So CLG has a legit shot of making it this year!!!"
CLG,3dxym6,tallGuy66,4,Mon Jul 20 16:57:47 2015 UTC,except the 4-team tourney is not a regular set-up. By circuit point it would look like:  G1: 4th v 5th   G2: Winner G1 vs 3rd  G3: Winner G2 vs 2nd  So the more points you get the less games you play and the more time you have to prepare for your games.
CLG,3dxym6,Zoone16,4,Mon Jul 20 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"ahh going LCK style. which i think makes sense, makes the points worth something,"

CLG,3dxym6,TheGravosSituation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:23 2015 UTC,So where would we have to finish in the playoffs to make the gauntlet? Just get past the first round and we're qualified?
CLG,3dxym6,SWORDamocles,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:02 2015 UTC,"There's still so many ways it can go down, but it seems like 3rd in playoffs is the point it starts to look favorable. If we assume worst-case scenario (we don't get a bye into semis and lose in quarters, and C9 place 7th keeping their championship points), Gravity needs to go 0-2 in week 9, lose the tiebreaker into playoffs, and lose their first playoff match and Dig have to also lose in quarterfinals. This is incredibly unlikely, so the next best is to place 4th in playoffs and have Dig lose in quarters. But as we still don't know how the playoff brackets will be set, it's impossible to know for sure who needs to lose in quarters. Basically, do better than Dig and hope C9 places 8th."
CLG,3dxym6,DiggyB,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"I just hope CLG is ready to play some good bo5s. I think they can beat GV(we should have 2-0'd them, we had their nexus open in game 2 and GV is a cheese team). TiP losing Adrian also makes me feel like CLG can take a bo5 off of them as well even if they looked scary lately. I would say TL would be our worst matchup in a best of 5 and I'd like to avoid TSM before playoff finals too. That being said, C9 getting 8th place and CLG winning the gauntlet would be the favourable way to get into Worlds. If only CLG came 3rd in Spring instead of TL, we could actually put some circuit points to use and just finish around 3rd in summer to qualify for Worlds automatically. It's not gonna be easy to qualify....I hope TSM/TL choke in round 1."

CLG,3dxym6,SovereignRLG,6,Mon Jul 20 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"Correct. Because TSM would go because they won, and CLG getting 2nd while TL finishes below 3rd makes us have the most Points and therefore auto qualify."
CLG,3dxym6,K0vsk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"For once, we actually look strong going into playoffs. So, cautious optimism is warranted.  Don't get your hopes too high though guys. TL, TSM, TIP, and GV are strong as fuck, and even without dank playoff memes, they have a good chance of just beating us in bo5, no choking involved.  I just hope that even if we don't make it, we understand that this split has been a huge improvement, especially considering this roster with Pob and Huhi is still new. And that we can look even better going into season 6. Just please no retire double."
CLG,3dxym6,DarkRyter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:13 2015 UTC,Isn't the gauntlet just the team that beats the rest goes to worlds? so what does it matter where the other teams end up?
CLG,3dxym6,Will_Ozellman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"So is there a possibility of both CLG and TL auto-qualifying for Worlds? For example, if CLG gets first and TL gets second?"

CLG,3dxym6,dtbrehm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:46:59 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if there are rules against this situation?  -TSM and CLG are the finalists in playoffs. TSM willingly concedes the first place worlds spot because they will go to worlds anyway with second place.

CLG,3dvzji,Seahorsebreeze,7,Mon Jul 20 05:52:02 2015 UTC,I really like how all the members of the OP5 were in our game today.  Really well deserved by all of them as well.
CLG,3dvzji,CarbonCreed,7,Mon Jul 20 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"Still, not sure how Hai got MVP, they gave Piglet mvp for stealing 1 Baron with Corki, Move stole multiple objectives this week, many times winning or stalling the game.   EDIT:NVM, realised why. Hai one of the few NA junglers to gank/apply pressure pre 20 mins."
CLG,3dvzji,yema96,12,Mon Jul 20 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Hai was CRAZY.  He completely turned around a failing team, albeit a little late.  His jungle pressure this week absolutely earned him a spot."
CLG,3dvzji,CarbonCreed,3,Mon Jul 20 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"Move's Vi was pretty lackluster overall though, he went something like 2/15/16 combined over the last two games.  Hai on the other hand had insane early pressure on us, he pretty much won the mid lane for Incarnation."
CLG,3dvzji,Tiggz-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"True that, Hai is probably the only NA jungler to apply pressure early other than Rush."
CLG,3dvzji,yema96,2,Mon Jul 20 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"Hai 100% deserved it. He took a 9th place team and made it look like a worlds contender. We all saw what C9 looks like without hai, and my god it ain't pretty."
CLG,3dvzji,meta4our,14,Mon Jul 20 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"Well deserved. I think he's been the best ADC this split by a pretty significant margin. His laning is still as awesome as ever, his teamfight positioning has improved massively, and on top of that his pressure game and objective control have been really good as well. So i definitely think that this MVP is well deserved. Here's to one more next week and a good playoffs run. Cheers :D"
CLG,3dvzji,trolz0rs,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"While I agree... I wouldn't say by a huge margin. Sneaky this split has shown us how capable he is. Top 2 ADC are DL and Sneaky for sure, with maybe Piglet in the lineup."
CLG,3dvzji,lilmama231,5,Mon Jul 20 00:45:23 2015 UTC,Sneaky's been pretty inconsistent. This game he played a stomp lane against Sivir Janna and still couldn't get past a ~15 cs lead (early on).
CLG,3dvzji,Seahorsebreeze,9,Mon Jul 20 05:53:18 2015 UTC,"Really?  I'd hesitate to even list Sneaky in top 3, with Altec and Piglet performing so consistently too.  Sure, Sneaky showed up this week, but he's been very inconsistent leading up to it."
CLG,3dvzji,santana722,14,Mon Jul 20 02:08:02 2015 UTC,Something that has been proven time and time again is that adc players are typically a reflection of their teams and it's hard to judge good ads on bad teams. Altec is a good example.
CLG,3dvzji,deemerritt,3,Mon Jul 20 02:38:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. When C9 was slumping in the spring split, Sneaky was still generally hailed as the best ADC in NA and he definitely looked like it.  This split, C9 was in a rut and we saw some very uncharacteristic plays from Sneaky that would lose C9 fights from the get go. This most definitely isn't his best split individually and truth be told, he isn't the  undisputed best ADC in NA right now."
CLG,3dvzji,BetaGreekLoL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:42:10 2015 UTC,I'd have to disagree Sneaky only looks inconsistent because his team was playing so poorly.
CLG,3dvzji,Neonxxv,-7,Mon Jul 20 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think Sneaky is still probably #1 in NA, but is not able to show his stuff because of the mess that C9 is in right now. Doublelift is not far behind him. Doublelift does probably has better raw mechanics than sneaky does though.  As for Altec, I think people are overrating him a little bit because, lets be real, nobody knows how to draft against Gravity, so teams always get weird ass comps that allow Altec to freely hit them for 30+ seconds. Im not saying Altec is terrible, but he's probably #5 behind CoreJJ, DL Piglet, and Sneaky."
CLG,3dvzji,ADelicateOrange,3,Mon Jul 20 02:54:54 2015 UTC,not even.
CLG,3dvzji,The_Real_Tang,3,Mon Jul 20 07:48:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that... in today's game Sneaky choked super hard to not get the pentakill (he could have flashed the Gragas E). I don't know if that would have been enough to win the game, but that first inhibitor was huge."
CLG,3dvzji,herptydurr,3,Mon Jul 20 10:28:18 2015 UTC,Altec behind corejj.  I'm done...
CLG,3dvzji,Hockeygod9911,0,Mon Jul 20 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"CoreJJ is 1v9ing every single game on Dignitas, and is looking pretty good. CoreJJ is literally fighting for his life on a team that closely resembles Winterfox.  On the other hand, Altec has top players in all his positions + Keane who is the penultimate anti-carry of mid laners.  CoreJJ may not be super hard carrying Dignitas to victories, but when he was and is trying to do with his terrible team, he looks great."
CLG,3dvzji,ADelicateOrange,-10,Mon Jul 20 17:11:01 2015 UTC,Piglet's better imo. I think Doublelift may be better than Altec so that would make him number 2.
CLG,3dvzji,BetaGreekLoL,4,Mon Jul 20 01:02:51 2015 UTC,baron steal mechanics?
CLG,3dvzji,perfbanes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"haha, thats just an upside.  Piglet isn't flashy but he has been putting out the numbers. Can adjust his laning to suit his team's needs. Teamfighting is on point too. Hard to think of a reason why he isn't better than Doublelift at this time."
CLG,3dvzji,BetaGreekLoL,3,Mon Jul 20 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"You can say all those things about DL too though, except DL seems to be more instrumental when his team wins, while on TL Fenix and Quas are often making the big plays"
CLG,3dvzji,rudebrooke,3,Mon Jul 20 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it more as a team effort. True, Fenx seems to be the main carry for TL this split, often making the plays or initiating fights while everyone else is a backdrop.  CLG, everyone pitches in. There isn't a person in that team that isn't critical to CLGs success atm and to see them finally play like this is a relief."
CLG,3dvzji,BetaGreekLoL,5,Mon Jul 20 02:42:41 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, Doublelift often does much more damage to champions than he really should be.   In the win vs C9 he did 44.2k on a low range adc (sivir), the next highest was P O B on 32k and then Zion on 28k. Theoretically P O B should have been doing a lot more damage than Doublelift, especially considering the game went for 50 minutes and Azir is a hyper carry. Sneaky did 37k Damage in comparison.  When CLG played against TL last game Doublelift did 18k damage to champions compared to Piglet's 11.7k. Piglet was on Corki too, and the missile spam alone should have kept him competitive in damage dealt. In the latest Zion was given a huge lead and only did 1k more damage than Quas did to champions despite his 60 creep advantage.  It's pretty much the cool thing not to give Doublelift his due credit anymore, but he really is the big carry on CLG still.  Edit: Why am I being down voted for discussing CLG players on the CLG sub reddit?"
CLG,3dvzji,rudebrooke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:48:23 2015 UTC,I didnt downvote :o  But thats interesting! I definitely didn't know that. Where can I find these stats for myself?

Piglet's KDA is really high because he positions himself extremely safely in team fights (similar to Rekkles), Doublelift gets criticized for ""bad teamfight positioning"" but he doesn't have the luxury of Quas/Dominate/Fenix destroying everyone (Or Huni, Febiven, RO in Rekkle's case).   A similar scenario would be Bjergsen for TSM, you notice that they will lose team fights because the entire enemy team just tries to dive him because he's doing the majority of their damage."

CLG,3dvzji,LOLAdreno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:14 2015 UTC,Because I felt he was underrepresented when he was on the team in terms of flairs. He was also a really big contributor to the teams success when he was playing on it.  Why do you care what my flair is?
CLG,3dvzji,rudebrooke,2,Mon Jul 20 09:41:54 2015 UTC,"I think Doublelift has better laning(may be due to the fact that he's laning with Aphro, but I still consider it). Rush Hour somehow manages to win in CS so often even though CLG has made it a focus of their early game to get Zionspartan ahead. It's hard to judge who is the better teamfighter, but these past couple of weeks Doublelift has shown that he has insane mechanics(i.e. his sivir spellshields were amazing&his use of rocket jump on trist is super smart&his dodging of skillshots is also incredible). I have rarely seen Doublelift misposition in a teamfight this split. On top of that I think Doublelift gets Kalista way less than other LCS ADCs so he's not just performing on the most OP ADC in the game."
CLG,3dvzji,ayylemaokai,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"I think they are the best at the many mechanics of ADC, Piglet better in some, Double better in others. Honestly I'm tired of simple blank statements of someone being better completely than someone else, because that's really ignorant and completely ignores the fact that League is a skill based game."
CLG,3dvzji,SheerFe4r,9,Mon Jul 20 03:44:07 2015 UTC,IMO doublelift is in the running for MVP of the summer split right now. He has consistently played well this entire split and been a key factor in many of CLG's wins.
CLG,3dvzji,PrettyThickDick,13,Mon Jul 20 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"Man if he didn't get mvp this week I would have called some collusion type shit on riots end.

But if you look at Ardent Censer's stats: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ardent_Censer  It gives everything a Janna would want. CDR, AP, Mana Regen, and Movement Speed.  Doublelift AND Pobelter benefit from the increased 15% attackspeed when Aphro shields either of them. But, Janna also has an AoE heal that grants everyone on the team the additional 30 on-hit magic damage.  The total cost of the item is only 2100 gold and it's build path is relatively easy."
CLG,3dvd5k,Slicerwind,11,Sun Jul 19 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"He was talking about the zeke's herald in isolation there, which does only have an AD and Lifestyle aura. The only main beneficiary of which would be doubles Sivir. Not complaining though :)"
CLG,3dvd5k,TH3_RUBB4_DUCK,3,Mon Jul 20 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Aphro explained to Double on a stream just the other day that he goes Zeke's because it gets him his 40% CDR as well as benefiting Double."
CLG,3dvd5k,jaceyy,4,Mon Jul 20 02:10:21 2015 UTC,MY HEART IS TOO WEAK!
CLG,3dvd5k,OurNameIsLegion,3,Sun Jul 19 21:05:07 2015 UTC,TOO MANY YEARS OF BEING A CLG FAN
CLG,3dvd5k,CarbonCreed,4,Sun Jul 19 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"I was shaking too... holy fuck, so much fun to watch."
CLG,3dvd5k,CarbonCreed,17,Sun Jul 19 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"The best thing is, this was really just C9 playing well. It was not thrash team beating us on our mistakes, just two great teams duking it out. So close, yet we prevailed..."
CLG,3dvd5k,enerccio,5,Sun Jul 19 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"The best they've looked this split, perhaps all season."
CLG,3dvd5k,RobotVandal,7,Sun Jul 19 21:29:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. And the best teamfighting we've seen from CLG all season.  Combine both of these elements and you have quite easily the most entertaining game of the split.    This is the kind of game that gives me hope that NA might be able to do something at worlds.
CLG,3dvd5k,mikelo22,140,Sun Jul 19 22:24:07 2015 UTC,Doublelift what a god. Spellshields everything
CLG,3dvd5k,XMatthew,49,Sun Jul 19 20:58:29 2015 UTC,His reflexes were fucking INSANE.  Those shockwave spellshields... amazing.
CLG,3dvd5k,CarbonCreed,31,Sun Jul 19 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"DL positioning was amazing this game. Sure the baron play didn't work but I can't really fault him for trying, they weren't gonna get anything extra if he failed.  Only other thing he shouldn't have done was try to duel Kalista a couple of times."
CLG,3dvd5k,BSalty,30,Sun Jul 19 21:01:32 2015 UTC,That was a huge mistake.  They should have gone for dragon 4.
CLG,3dvd5k,abetadist,11,Sun Jul 19 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in the moment that was a hard call. I'd say all in all it didn't lose THAT much. At least I'd put it at medium risk extremely high reward.  edit: People seem to think I don't understand that it ended bad... I do, i'm saying in that short moment of making a call it's not some awful decision people are making it out to be. Yes 4th drag would have been better. But from their point of view they're just trying to stop a baron vs 3 low targets with a full HP DL. Honestly if the spear hadn't hit Moo it's a pretty easy baron to stop/delay through kiting imo. Spear ruined the whole plan though. I think it's worth considering since it's not likely that they can turn it into towers/inhibs/immediate drag after.   t;dr - It didn't work out, it wasn't the right call. I understand but I think that it wasn't a huge misplay in the situation. That's just my opinion on the call."
CLG,3dvd5k,BSalty,12,Sun Jul 19 21:05:26 2015 UTC,"It was a fuck up, but shit like that happens. Throughout the game, CLG has made some mistake, that if they were to fix, would probably allow them to take 1st place."
CLG,3dvd5k,lilmama231,24,Sun Jul 19 21:16:01 2015 UTC,He even managed to spellshield Kalista rend sometimes. That's some captain jack lvl shit right there.
CLG,3dvd5k,xKamitsuki,4,Sun Jul 19 21:07:24 2015 UTC,"You play enough ADC, sometimes you just get a feel of knowing the Kalista is going to rend. That being said, to be able to actually spell shield it is damn hard."
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,4,Sun Jul 19 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"Sivir main diamond 1, never have spellshield rend, double confirmed GOD"
CLG,3dvd5k,recr3t,4,Sun Jul 19 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but he stayed cool under pressure too. Incarnation tried to bait out the spell shield by recalling the ball, but DL didn't budge and just kept booking it back to mid turret. Not getting trigger happy with the shield was key."
CLG,3dvd5k,ChillFactory,14,Sun Jul 19 22:57:43 2015 UTC,Seriously this game was like battle of the ad carries in those teamfights. Incredible play from both Sneaky and Double.
CLG,3dvd5k,ORyanx,10,Sun Jul 19 21:07:09 2015 UTC,A literal God
CLG,3dvd5k,Ansibled,13,Sun Jul 19 21:05:17 2015 UTC,He looked so fucking satisfied after the game. As he should be. He played SOOOOOOO well that game.
CLG,3dvd5k,mint420,3,Sun Jul 19 21:01:17 2015 UTC,can someone PLEASE make a montage. please.
CLG,3dvd5k,blablublablu,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:41 2015 UTC,Can someone make a video of it all.  There were so many clutch spell shields.
CLG,3dvd5k,Eyyoh,117,Sun Jul 19 22:46:54 2015 UTC,Beat Xpecial Beat a team ahead of them in standings Beat C9 Hai Won a game when down 5000 gold several times Won a game after a couple bad decisions after bringing the game back Won a game on teamfights Won a game because Pobelter made plays after a down game yesterday   Great week for CLG! :)  EDIT: how about those clutch Xmithie body slams?
CLG,3dvd5k,abetadist,57,Sun Jul 19 21:01:15 2015 UTC,Can we talk about his clutch ultimate on the first big teamfight win for  CLG? He knocked away EVERYONE from Incarnation and allowed CLG to take out C9's most fed member. Where has this guy been all split?
CLG,3dvd5k,OurNameIsLegion,9,Sun Jul 19 21:06:25 2015 UTC,And this on the C9 and Incarnation that showed up too.
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,4,Sun Jul 19 21:21:17 2015 UTC,That ult was so good.
CLG,3dvd5k,WILDWAYNE001,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:32 2015 UTC,Typically these Xmithie appearances happen exclusively in scrims.
CLG,3dvd5k,cannyOCE,16,Mon Jul 20 07:42:55 2015 UTC,Yo those Gragas ults were on point. That 4 man that let CLG isolate Incarnation was amazing.
CLG,3dvd5k,recursion8,15,Sun Jul 19 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"I remember watching SI and hearing monte say a few times that the mark of the good teams is not that they're never behind, but that they can play from a deficit and still win. This made a lot of sense to me and I have found ever since that it seems to hold true. We've been securing early leads over tsm for like a year and a half now but have rarely converted it to a win becuase they were generally more solid than us, executing from behind.  I have NEVER seen CLG be a threat from behind and they've shown that they have that against perhaps the greatest shotcaller the west has ever produced. They showed yesterday how to spar in an equal game against a top team. And furthermore I can already hear Limes's coaching in their interviews. The things that they are saying and the way they are approaching things reminds of traditional sports. American football is extremely job and team oriented and I think that's translating. #cautiouslyoptimisticage"
CLG,3dvd5k,RobotVandal,2,Sun Jul 19 21:24:29 2015 UTC,Hai is for sure the best western shot caller. He has no competition.
CLG,3dvd5k,deemerritt,12,Mon Jul 20 02:27:09 2015 UTC,Won a game when down 5000 gold several times   Fuck xpecial but I think this one is my favourite.
CLG,3dvd5k,x_Steve,7,Sun Jul 19 21:05:39 2015 UTC,During the interview with Aphromoo it was mentioned that CLG has never won while that far behind. This is good news indeed.
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,8,Sun Jul 19 21:22:09 2015 UTC,And ults
CLG,3dvd5k,Allpal,9,Sun Jul 19 21:05:39 2015 UTC,"EDIT: how about those clutch Xmithie body slams?   Holy shit especially having a midlaner that doesn't tilt off of bad laning. Sure he got speared a couple times, once before an important teamfight. But they worked around an Azir that was behind. So efficient!"
CLG,3dvd5k,Seahorsebreeze,3,Sun Jul 19 21:09:03 2015 UTC,I just wanna point out we just beat the team late game that is revered for their late game decision making
CLG,3dvd5k,Banbaur,43,Sun Jul 19 21:28:07 2015 UTC,Best game of the split. Incredible.  Sidenote: The razor cake is looking so magnificently delicious.
CLG,3dvd5k,habs114,11,Sun Jul 19 20:59:30 2015 UTC,What has happened is we found the razor earlier on this split. So now we can enjoy and eat our cake razor free. #faithage
CLG,3dvd5k,ORyanx,27,Sun Jul 19 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"No one would be so cruel as to put two razors in a cake, right?  ...Right?"
CLG,3dvd5k,CCSkyfish,77,Sun Jul 19 21:41:42 2015 UTC,Watch all those sivir plays and tell me doublelift isnt a top adc
CLG,3dvd5k,nagez,21,Sun Jul 19 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"but... it's just a sivir comp, you just group and win, lmao"
CLG,3dvd5k,mikelo22,5,Sun Jul 19 21:23:34 2015 UTC,donezo
CLG,3dvd5k,Fluxxed,30,Sun Jul 19 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"but... but.. piglet, sneaky, and altec are so much better and doublelift is just washed up and should retire"
CLG,3dvd5k,JayMillah,34,Sun Jul 19 21:12:13 2015 UTC,I remember people were saying cop and turtle were better than him too last split.
CLG,3dvd5k,nagez,16,Sun Jul 19 21:13:31 2015 UTC,I remember watching doublelift push turtle's shit in under base tower 1 on 1 and I knew turtle would never be as good as him.
CLG,3dvd5k,RobotVandal,15,Sun Jul 19 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"Only problem with Doublelift was his ego, but it seems CLG's management has done well controlling it. I don't think I've seen anyone spellsheild that well before. From yesterday's game to today's, he has to get the mvp for this week."
CLG,3dvd5k,yema96,4,Sun Jul 19 21:26:19 2015 UTC,I will be pretty damn surprised if he doesn't get MVP for the week.
CLG,3dvd5k,Eyyoh,14,Sun Jul 19 21:52:56 2015 UTC,DOUBLELIFT is the God of NA ad carries. No one else comes fucking close. This guy has consistently carried the team all split and will continue to do so. It's finally worth having been a huge fanboy since Season 2. Like holy shit this guy is playing out of his mind and rightfully so.
CLG,3dvd5k,whatsuppunk,11,Sun Jul 19 21:46:10 2015 UTC,the resurgence from him is so fantastic. got me feelin like its S2
CLG,3dvd5k,sawlover6065,5,Sun Jul 19 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"completely agree. He sometimes loosens up a little too much against bottom tier teams but when he's dueling the ADCs he respects (Piglet,Sneaky) you just SEE him turn up his game to 100% and play like a freakin monster"
CLG,3dvd5k,daredevil39,25,Mon Jul 20 01:50:14 2015 UTC,Rush Hour show once again.
CLG,3dvd5k,ldealis,15,Sun Jul 19 20:59:00 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious that Aphro has so much impact on teamfights without even using his ultimate. Great howling gales and shields. That Dlift though, stellar play."
CLG,3dvd5k,Eijink,14,Sun Jul 19 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"Aphro got caught alone a couple times though, only bad part of his performance."
CLG,3dvd5k,recursion8,10,Sun Jul 19 21:08:53 2015 UTC,Well nida spears are retarded
CLG,3dvd5k,enerccio,5,Sun Jul 19 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"He also did a random flash tornado at the end of a fight that only hit a full hp Incarnation while the team was nowhere near enough to act on it. It didn't have a negative effect on the game, but it would've been nice to hold onto the flash"
CLG,3dvd5k,StigmaaH,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:42 2015 UTC,Some questionable moments but overall I think the whole team showed up. POB came back despite his early start.
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,53,Sun Jul 19 21:31:31 2015 UTC,What a game. Pobelter is God in teamfights.
CLG,3dvd5k,OmniscientOctopode,30,Sun Jul 19 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously. He got dumped on all early game, but he made the most amazing plays where it counted!"
CLG,3dvd5k,Arodante,13,Sun Jul 19 20:59:20 2015 UTC,you know that is the difference between him and link. Both are good players but Pob just doesn´t choke or shuts down.
CLG,3dvd5k,Peterrussosghost1,9,Sun Jul 19 21:07:03 2015 UTC,Well tbf pobelter admitted to  tilting in lane but he also recovered to really carry the late game teamfights
CLG,3dvd5k,larrybirdac1,6,Sun Jul 19 21:16:47 2015 UTC,His willingness to dive and make the plays was amazing to see. He trusted his teammates to follow up even if he died.
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,5,Sun Jul 19 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"That to me is the biggest difference between pob and link.  If link gets messed up he would play more cautiously and try to fuck up less. Pob plays the same and is still trying to make plays. They are both ""skilled"" but pob has the right mentality for high level play."
CLG,3dvd5k,JuanBARco,11,Mon Jul 20 02:23:57 2015 UTC,I was all ready to come rag on pob in the post game thread for his poor early game positioning and laning but he MORE than made up for it with his late game team fighting. dang man
CLG,3dvd5k,hardythedrummer,5,Sun Jul 19 21:04:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Honestly, Pob's biggest problem is that he's so fucking aggressive in lane. Even when he's down in CS, or in a bad matchup he still goes ham. But his team fighting this game was absolutely flawless."
CLG,3dvd5k,OmniscientOctopode,10,Sun Jul 19 21:13:15 2015 UTC,The NA dade.
CLG,3dvd5k,yema96,6,Sun Jul 19 21:22:14 2015 UTC,I'd rather have an agressive midlaner than a passive one.
CLG,3dvd5k,spirited1,9,Sun Jul 19 21:55:22 2015 UTC,Pobelter the second coming of Jiji?!?!?!
CLG,3dvd5k,Eyyoh,10,Sun Jul 19 21:27:23 2015 UTC,ALL HAIL EUGENE
CLG,3dvd5k,CarbonCreed,9,Sun Jul 19 21:00:18 2015 UTC,That last ult to trap them all into the baron pit was fucking incredible
CLG,3dvd5k,larrybirdac1,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"""THE PINCUSHION"""
CLG,3dvd5k,recursion8,3,Sun Jul 19 21:07:26 2015 UTC,Failed hard in lane but made the clutch plays later on.  Definitely did what Link wouldn't do in his situation. Good pick up by CLG. I hope Pobelter picks up his game though and everyone else continues to play some good league. Would be great for CLG if they could do the 6-0 into what will most likely be a tiebreaker next week.
CLG,3dvd5k,BetaGreekLoL,22,Sun Jul 19 21:42:32 2015 UTC,2-0 WEEKEND. CLG AT THE TOP OF THE STANDINGS.  FAITHAGE  Zion played like a GOD this game and Xmithie gave his best performance ALL SEASON. PLAYOFFS HERE WE COME BOYS.

CLG,3dvd5k,Barbato101,4,Sun Jul 19 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"TSM will probably get 6th. To attain worlds by circuit points, CLG has to lose against TSM in the finals. (AKA if CLG gets to the finals vs TSM CLG instantly goes to worlds, as does TSM)  CLG thus does not want to get 1st place because 1st place team faces whoever wins between 3rd and 6th, it would force them to play TSM in the semis.  Edit: TSM will probably actually get 5th."
CLG,3dvd5k,naturesbfLoL,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:49 2015 UTC,i think first plays 4/5. why would you punish the first place team by making them play the most likely third place team. second seed gets punished for that.

Xmithie had one if his best games of the season, and Pob came through even if he was a bit shaky.   God damn dude we did it - this was the most deserving win of the season. THEY EARNED THAT SHIT."
CLG,3dvd5k,I_Ruv_Kpop,13,Sun Jul 19 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"DL been the man this entire split. Even in their usual collapse, he was solid as hell. It just wasn't those 4 games. DL hasn't looked this strong in a while. In spring he was good, had some inconsistency and his teamfighting was weak but this time around, he looks a lot more all-rounded."
CLG,3dvd5k,BetaGreekLoL,7,Sun Jul 19 21:44:41 2015 UTC,Doublelift does NOT make mistakes holy shit.  inb4 baron call
CLG,3dvd5k,OurNameIsLegion,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:54 2015 UTC,I think that was a fairly big mistake...Dragon was up IIRC.
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,9,Sun Jul 19 21:30:19 2015 UTC,I doubt that was his call though.
CLG,3dvd5k,santana722,2,Sun Jul 19 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"Well if he follows up on the call made, kudos to him. It's good that the team will follow up on calls. Still, sometimes, it's good to say, ""No, that's a bad play. This one's is objectively better."" I feel that this was one of those moments but hindsight is 20/20."
CLG,3dvd5k,Nefari0uss,6,Sun Jul 19 22:12:50 2015 UTC,Sure Xmithie was pretty good but still managed to scare me a couple times :D

CLG,3dvd5k,nagez,7,Sun Jul 19 21:00:18 2015 UTC,i mean he had that one bad re-engage at their own blue. tbh tho i like to see  him taking more risks and setting up plays. if he can refine that we'll be golden
CLG,3dvd5k,theRAMJAM,24,Sun Jul 19 21:04:29 2015 UTC,Zion and Doublelift carried so fucking HARD
CLG,3dvd5k,CLG_Portobello,10,Sun Jul 19 21:00:06 2015 UTC,I would say pobelter carried the late game team fights despite getting dumpstered early. Either way everyone clutched up this game towards the mid-late game
CLG,3dvd5k,larrybirdac1,4,Sun Jul 19 21:06:04 2015 UTC,The game would have been over if it wasn't for Zion's plays. POB carried late but it would t have even gone late game.
CLG,3dvd5k,CLG_Portobello,6,Sun Jul 19 21:07:35 2015 UTC,For sure but that means everyone really played to their roles in this game
CLG,3dvd5k,larrybirdac1,18,Sun Jul 19 21:09:38 2015 UTC,pob??? hello??? he went fucking off. he carried so hard.
CLG,3dvd5k,Luckyshoot3r,9,Sun Jul 19 21:04:11 2015 UTC,POB would have never made late game if it wasn't for Zion's plays mid game with those kennen ults. The game would have been over a long time ago.

CLG,3dvd5k,SirLazarus,4,Sun Jul 19 21:00:26 2015 UTC,"Xmithie's best ever game in a CLG shirt. His body slam on sneaky after he'd killed Pob and double won the game for us. And THAT gragas ult was absolutely insane. Really amazing to see him reach some of the level he had in season 3. Excited to see if he can finally grow to the player we thought we were getting. Obviously, let's not go overboard although. these last two games are a small sample, but it definitely looks more promising as he wasn't as this decisive ever. Go xmithie! And the rest of the team were great too. Really feels like we might be able to produce this time."

Little poor play in the early game but handled the camp pretty well overall and didn't give up a kill till that silly heavily forced gank mid but oh well. Incredible teamfighting by pob damn did he carry some fights really hard. Extremely solid game by Doublelift too. Apart from that baron where could you say he really messed up? His spellshields and positioning were so good.   No this was not the best game in eu and na lcs this split so far. Gonna have to disagree with reddit on that one.

CLG,3dvd5k,neofederalist,3,Sun Jul 19 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"Pobelter has never ever been a top tier laner, he's a playmaker who excels in team fights and skirmishes. That's why he looked so mediocre on WFX, that team was so bad that he couldnt even get to the point where he could be cool, the team fell apart before that.   Think of him as season 1 jiji 2.0."

CLG,3dwhe2,silveranalysis,20,Mon Jul 20 03:41:49 2015 UTC,Great unbiased insight on the game and the strengths/weaknesses of both teams. This is what CLG fans should really judge CLG on and not some biased insight from Saint.
CLG,3dwhe2,Yuikai,7,Mon Jul 20 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"Watching it right now, but it really seems like he's pandering heavily to the 'CLG tilt' meme  I also disliked the pick/ban analysis. Whenever an analyst gives a cop-out answer like 'oh he wanted to play kennen just because', either:   He didn't put much thought into the pick He did put thought into the pick and couldn't figure it out   Dismissing a pick from one of the best top-lane players who also has access to analysis and a coaching staff is just lazy. At the very least a real pick/ban analysis should give us the kind of basic reasoning we got from Zion in his lolesports interview. At that point, if the reasoning is bad, the analyst is free to critique the pick."
CLG,3dwhe2,Pinith,11,Mon Jul 20 08:21:18 2015 UTC,I don't think he was that heavy on the CLG tilt meme other than when  Pobelter was making all those misplays early game.
CLG,3dwhe2,ayylemaokai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:03:13 2015 UTC,"My issue is the 'lane story' YamatoCannon creates is really weak.    Ori is picked after Azir, and we're told that Ori loses to Azir in lane, but we aren't given specifics on why or how. Azir starts losing to Ori pretty badly, and the only analysis is because of 'CLG midseason tilt'. He even dismisses Hai's impact on mid ('just two spears'), and blames it purely on laning skill     At this point, we the viewers have much more evidence that Ori counters Azir since she was picked second despite 'not making sense in the composition' and won the lane so hard. I know mid lane matchups can be pretty subtle but the analysis would have been much stronger if YamatoCannon had more justification for 'Azir > Ori'.    If Azir counters Ori, how much CS should he win by 10min?  Which trades or ability combos are hard for Ori to deal with?  Which Ori combos does Azir negate with his kit?"
CLG,3dwhe2,Pinith,6,Mon Jul 20 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your analysis here. Early on in the video YamatoCannon states that ori has an advantage over azir because ori can just walk up and auto with her passive and attack with her ball while azir can only create soldiers. I also thought that YamatoCannon didn't bring up the tilt meme that much, it was usually just in reference to how POB was doing in lane, which is understandable because POB definitely misplayed a couple of times."
CLG,3dwhe2,Geemb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"But isn't that basically the opposite of what YamatoCannon states? He says that azir wins the matchup during pick ban and then he says that ori wins the trades early on because of auto attacks. If azir wins the matchup, shouldn't he win the trades?"
CLG,3dwhe2,Velluvial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:10 2015 UTC,I think YamatoCannon meant that azir loses lane vs orianna early but has better late game Teamfight presence and scaling
CLG,3dwhe2,Geemb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"he said lvl 1 and 2, where ori has ball and autoattacks whereas azir only has soldiers which is easy to dodge without Q, azir need all 3 abilities before the lane is in his favour, however level 1 to 3 is so short of a time compared to the rest of the laning phase where azir is more favoured, if that makes sense"
CLG,3dwhe2,Ninjakkr,0,Mon Jul 20 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"Can't Azir just create soldiers and attack from a really safe distance while juking Q and then save his E for Orianna ult?Idk, I just kept seeing Pobelter getting chunked to less than 10% HP every time they panned to the mid lane(even before gank pressure) which lead me to believe Pobelter was getting destroyed by incarnation early and it shouldn't happen to such a degree. Even in clearly bad matchups, I don't see why Pobelter should have like 60% of his opponents CS for such a long time in the early game. It's understandable later in the game when Hai starts camping mid. Also, I think he referenced the POB tilt when Pobelter just dashed into C9 as Azir randomnly after doublelift took dragon. Btw, I'm not hating on POB, I just think he played very strangely for most of this game, but he came clutch."
CLG,3dwhe2,ayylemaokai,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's harder at earlier levels for azir to do that because he has less mobility/doesn't have high enough attack speed or cdr to poke well enough. Also I think pob took a bad trade at level 2 so he was playing off his back foot from then on, especially considering Hai's mid pressure."
CLG,3dwhe2,Geemb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:29 2015 UTC,Ori's shield is really good at rank 1 as well.
CLG,3dwhe2,naoww,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"It's hard to judge lane matchups if you don't play those specific champions. I think Yamato just said ""Ori wins somewhat early and Azir wins later"". Very general stuff but imo I think the lane can go either way. Incarnation was up like 17ish CS before Hai even first came to gank mid. Pobelter never really caught up in CS from there on, but honestly based on the information we get from our camera view, it seems like Pobelter got outplayed in lane(the CS difference, the 2v1 by Incarnation where Pobelter didn't barrier&missed combo). I don't think the champions mattered as much as Pobelter tilting&Incarnation having huge confidence after his previous Ahri game and C9's upswing from adding Hai. I guess Yamato could have went more into depth on the matchup&mentioned the Nidalee pressure as well, but I think he still gave Pobelter some credit later in the game for his plays."
CLG,3dwhe2,ayylemaokai,8,Mon Jul 20 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"he was talking about pob tilting from lane due to the cs lead, pob mentioned this himself on twitter, https://twitter.com/Pobelter/status/622874759919874048"

CLG,3dwhe2,Pinith,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, gave Xmithie credit where it was due and pointed out aphros mistakes which people don't like to do much"
CLG,3dwhe2,Ninjakkr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:16:16 2015 UTC,"Not sure about being unbiased. He was pretty biased against certain picks like Karma which I actually think let them survive several crucial moments when CLG tried to engage with Sivir ult and item actives and also after kiting back it let them reengage the fight. Might have been very clutch with another support. Also he was a bit biased against Janna but I dont think anything other than Alistar would have provided the necessary disengage that was needed for a comp with next to no tank line.   I do agree with him for the most part but part of him is judging the comps in current EU meta where some of these picks are not given any priority. He did re consider in between the analysis about certain things.  About Saint's analysis I would say if CLG wants to improve they should welcome any form of criticism, biased or not it will definitely help if they actually want to make Worlds"
CLG,3dwhe2,htt91,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"Really great analysis on a great game. Watching such an intense game of two of my favorite teams with so many team fights, I realize that I wasn't paying attention to things like side waves. Overall great teamfighting by clg. Great game by xmithie, every clg fan should rewatch this game and appreciate their jungler for once. POB teamfought his way back.

This one is all about what c9 could have done to win and how clg is tilting.  E.g. Zion picks kenen (obvious counter to the kalista and ori by keeping them locked in place or zoned, also counters were picked and banned (alistar\janna)) and his analysis is ""kennen is a shitty pick, people only pick it cuz they want to play it"""

CLG,3dy89d,Prim3MavericK,7,Mon Jul 20 23:16:06 2015 UTC,I don't like the vibe ZeRo gives off. He's an amazing player; no doubt. I just don't support having him on CLG.  My 2 cents.
CLG,3dy89d,GutsGlad,5,Mon Jul 20 16:26:36 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate?
CLG,3dy89d,Prim3MavericK,3,Mon Jul 20 19:53:15 2015 UTC,"ZeRo is a player that's very much known for doing whatever tactics to win. His playstyle is very annoying to deal with and he's very proud and cocky about it.   In Brawl he played Meta Knight, an SS-Tier character and often won by hit-and-run tactics.  I'm Project M he played Pit. He camped on one side of the stage, spammed arrows, and would rush in to kill you once you were at kill percentage.  In Sm4sh he played ZSS however, Diddy Kong (pre-nerf) had a guaranteed combo (AKA the ""hoo-hah""). ZeRo very strongly voiced his opinion about banning Diddy Kong from tournament. The verdict was no. So as a result, ZeRo played Diddy Kong and abused the hoo-hah.   To be fair, I haven't seen him play Sm4sh recently and maybe he's changed. But as it stands, I don't like ZeRo on CLG."
CLG,3dy89d,GutsGlad,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"Diddy Kong was nerfed significantly recently, so Zero plays Sheik instead since she's widely believed to be the best character in the game. He's the kind of guy that plays whatever is strongest, which is part of the reason he's dropped only a single set in 41 straight tournament victories, including winning EVO without dropping a single game.  He did play Diddy Kong in Grand Finals of EVO and decimated despite the nerfs, after playing Sheik in every other match in the tournament.  I don't know much about his personality, and I don't know anything about Project M or Brawl. I just know he's the most well known Smash 4 player in the world, and the best Smash 4 player in the world by a massive margin. If we wanted to get a Smash 4 player, it should be Zero before anyone else.  I'd rather have Nairo, but there's no logic behind it. I just like Nairo."

CLG,3dy89d,Dbearslayer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that after I posted this. If TSM gets Zero, then I want CLG Nairo. Zero already refers to Nairo as his rival, and I'm a huge Nairo fan anyway."

CLG,3dvet8,ZoroAkarui,33,Sun Jul 19 21:12:29 2015 UTC,Glad to see the improvement in his teamfighting but early game pressure is still concerning.
CLG,3dvet8,kale1112,7,Sun Jul 19 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he did pretty well in team fights, but one of the reasons C9 was able to get so far ahead was because of the IMMENSE pressure Hai was able to put on the map where Xmithie had zero. Don't know if it was entirely Xmithie's fault, as a lot of that has to do with how your lanes/team decide to play the game, but definitely something CLG should look into improving this next week."
CLG,3dvet8,SeveralKnapkins,31,Sun Jul 19 21:24:04 2015 UTC,I mean I could be wrong but it also factored into the matchup. Doesn't nid just shit on Grag early?
CLG,3dvet8,BSalty,27,Sun Jul 19 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"She does, xmithie can't really have early presence when nidalee is the best early game jungler in the game. If xmithie didnt constantly come mid to help cover for POB, POB would have lost the early game even harder."
CLG,3dvet8,PrettyThickDick,5,Sun Jul 19 21:40:21 2015 UTC,"Every lane except zions were losing hard and getting pushed in, and nidalee counters gragas. Xmithie played the early game as well as he could have."
CLG,3dvet8,meta4our,4,Mon Jul 20 00:19:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. Also who would've known Hai plays nid jungle. I bet that threw them off
CLG,3dvet8,daniel5426,5,Sun Jul 19 22:00:49 2015 UTC,Hai's champion pool is stupidly good for a guy who was kinda just thrown into the role.
CLG,3dvet8,teniaava,4,Sun Jul 19 23:16:23 2015 UTC,Well he did play Nid mid. Nid jungle is still Nid at the end of the day.
CLG,3dvet8,Nefari0uss,5,Mon Jul 20 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"that's the thing he has no pool, so he can play everything, because he's inexperienced at everything.  He has no patterns so he's hard to figure out."

CLG,3dvet8,krcnu,6,Mon Jul 20 17:19:56 2015 UTC,a gragas wont have a much pressure as a nid. >.<
CLG,3dvet8,ss4chris,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the difference was insane. Like, insane, insane. Like 5k gold lead insane and two snowballed lanes insane. That's not match determined. CLG was able to come back from 5k gold deficits TWICE, which is also insane. And their teamfighting was off the walls, but that doesn't mean they don't need to shore up early jungle pressure."
CLG,3dvet8,SeveralKnapkins,6,Sun Jul 19 23:01:18 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong, but I think Pobelter straight up botched his levels 2 to 4 and got bullied out of lane by Incarnation. At that point, Hai started his nonstop harassment. Pobelter did not want to leave lane and fall behind in levels and CS, but it meant that he was so low that a single spear would be the end of him. So you'll notice for most of that time, Xmithie basically had to stand in front of Pobelter to catch spears while Pobelter tried to get experience and farm.  Could Xmithie have exerted more pressure? There was probably an opportunity or two. However, I think the losing situation in mid (and the other lanes, honestly) probably relegated him to acting as a bodyguard. I do think his ults and body slams handily turned the game, so credit where credit is due. I believe that given the situation, he played the early game well. Nidalee is just a monster in terms of movement and harassment. To me, the bigger problem is how badly Pobelter got chunked by Incarnation early on, but he did make up for it with his late game moves."
CLG,3dvet8,Sincerely-a-bookworm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Every single good Nidalee game looks exactly like this one. Gragas will always fail to put any kind of pressure in a Nidalee matchup, his best option is to farm while trying to help the lanes which is exactly what he did. He got first blood top if I remember correctly, and he tried to gank mid a couple times, but Pobelter was playing terrible early on and he went in too soon in one of those ganks and died before Xmithie could even touch Orianna. That's about as much as you can do in that matchup."
CLG,3dvet8,playergt,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"If every single good Nidalee game looked like this, everybody would be playing Nidalee nonstop or it would be permaban. I agree that him putting pressure is more difficult than running up to lane, hucking a spear and calling it good, but there is a big difference between less pressure and a 5k deficit worth of pressure. Like I said earlier, I'm not blaming Xmithie because the performance of the jungler is entirely dependent on the team and what the team wants from him, but saying they should be able to shore up weaknesses that lead to a 5k deficit shouldn't be controversial. There are good things to take from this game (mostly CLGs ability to team fight and claw their way back into games), but there are also things to take away that the team as a whole can improve on: I think this is one of them."
CLG,3dvet8,SeveralKnapkins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"Sure but when @10 minutes into the game Xmithie had close to double the CS of Hai, and 1 kill to the 0 kills 0 assists of its opponent, maybe you should actually blame the lanes who were getting outplayed even without the Nidalee influence?"
CLG,3dvet8,playergt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:55:45 2015 UTC,I mean nid is pretty much pick or ban 100% right now... It is considered the strongest jungler and even usually taken in the first rotation.
CLG,3dvet8,PandaCodeRed,-6,Mon Jul 20 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"At this point im wondering if its a concious choice. If not, surely someone at clg has to wonder why they have like the lowest jungle pressure in the league.  At this point, from seeing all fail plays, i think as soon as xmithie does something decent/good people hype it as having a great showing while it should be your minimum requirments."
CLG,3dvet8,Will_Ozellman,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:08 2015 UTC,Nah i think it was only today. Yesterday we crushed top lane and had HUGE early game pressure
CLG,3dvet8,Heonman,0,Sun Jul 19 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing about xmithie. He probably does more work securing vision than any other jungler in na. He has a finite amount of time to farm, gank, and secure vision. As a result his pressure does falter. However clg uses the vision to ensure safer leads by out rotating other teams and securing towers/objectives.   I also think clg in general won't gank top until dragon is down. If you gank top it is a free drag in competitive unless there has been a swap. As a result he spends more time on the bottom half and just clearing wards.   I think it is a fine strategy. Ganks can throw games pretty hard."
CLG,3dvet8,JuanBARco,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:45 2015 UTC,Move? I don't know how you typed that with a straight face with move in the league.
CLG,3dvet8,PandaCodeRed,0,Mon Jul 20 01:49:13 2015 UTC,Honestly POB just played like shit until team fights. He was losing lane from level 1. Before nid ever showed up and he never caught back up until the very end
CLG,3dvet8,amumulessthan3,0,Mon Jul 20 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can't be denied that his early game was very lackluster, especially when compared to Hai. I'd definitely like to see him have more of an impact early.  That said, you have to give credit where its due and he did great later in the game these past 2 games."
CLG,3dvet8,mint420,12,Mon Jul 20 08:04:02 2015 UTC,Xmithie played like a fuckin baller in the mid to late game.

CLG,3dvet8,datboijustin,9,Sun Jul 19 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"This was honestly a very well played game by him - the early game problems were definitely not his fault. Everyone was losing lane except for zion, so it was really hard for Xmithie to help everyone as much as Hai was pressuring. He definitely couldn't duel Nidalee, and couldn't add the same kind of pressure without committing to a full gank (which could easily be countered since they didn't have vision on nidalee).  That being said, he was able to get ahead in farm pretty early and translate that to early vision control which help CLG stabilize. In mid to late game, he did his job and did it really well, with some clutch catches and great ults in team fights to create enough chaos for CLG to isolate important targets. This is one of those game where I think every player on CLG played really well when it mattered, and so Xmithie might have gotten overlooked."
CLG,3dvet8,hardythedrummer,5,Mon Jul 20 01:24:29 2015 UTC,Pretty much everyone's reaction going against a nidalee  .Seriously was the sole reason Xmithie couldn't do anything early.

CLG,3dvet8,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Sun Jul 19 22:34:13 2015 UTC,The lack of early game presence is a byproduct of CLG picking two losing lane matchups and a losing jungle matchup. not much xmithie can do when nidalee is the best early jungler in the game and hes basically forced to sit mid with POB and make sure he doesnt get tower dove.
CLG,3dvet8,PrettyThickDick,0,Sun Jul 19 22:34:20 2015 UTC,azir is actually a winning matchup into ori but it's a losing 2v2 for clg which is almost certainly why hai put so much pressure mid early (+ incarnation ignite for kill pressure)
CLG,3dvet8,sorendiz,4,Sun Jul 19 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"Really happy with him this week, played his heart out, like a true man of the golden age. Had a lack of pressure due to playing Grag though, nid is just so great of a jungler though so it was expected. These performances have probably secured him from getting benched, lol, as long as CLG gets a bye or doesn't get taken out in the 1st round of playoffs. He's staying, lol.

CLG,3dvet8,Audunseth,-7,Sun Jul 19 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Hai completly outjungled him. Lots of misplay early game, as usual.  Don't get me wrong, the 2 ults were clutch and critical in clg success. But CLG needs a jungler who can do this every game.  This doesn't excuse the kiwikid level of times he gets caught."
CLG,3dvet8,salomon42,11,Sun Jul 19 23:27:34 2015 UTC,"lots of misplay early game? tell me what exactly he could do instead of farming (which he was ahead in) and camp mid. Tell me? Gragas can't match Nid's early pressure dude. If he forced ganks against a nid early with mid losing, they could fell behind even more like shown when he tried to force gank mid and incarnation got a kill without dieing."
CLG,3dvet8,Ehler,7,Sun Jul 19 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"Xmithie doubled Hai's CS @ 10 while Hai didn't got a single kill and Xmithie had one.  Traded pressure and mid lane gold for jungle gold, which ended up being ok because Azir is still Azir and CLG needed his only tank to actually be tanky. Only point where Hai outjungled Xmithie was when he got the 2nd CLG blue. Still, same could apply the other way around for the dragon control.  I'm not saying Xmithie is perfect or anything, but he can't take the blame for whatever happened early game this game, specially not while being Gragas against Nidalee."
CLG,3dvet8,playergt,0,Sun Jul 19 21:49:30 2015 UTC,"and CLG needed his only tank to actually be tanky.   People overlook this waaaay too much, we've been playing most of out games with 1 tank comps, and in those kind of comps if the tank gets behind and doesn't get tanky enough, you are 90% going to lose.  All those times Xmithie lives with <100 HP? That's him doing his job close to perfection, soaking up damage to the limit so Double/Pob/Zion can kill everyone. And it happends a lot.  Also another thing people aren't valuing enough imo is the synergy between him and Aphro, they go together a lot around the map warding everything which is something most top teams have been doing for a long time but for some reason NA teams don't."
CLG,3dvet8,Joolazoo,-6,Sun Jul 19 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"He played pretty well...but I still don't think he's a good player. He looks good when we win if he doesn't make any incredibly stupid plays but rarely if ever does he look good by himself, and his mechanics look iffy at best at all times."
CLG,3dvet8,playergt,0,Mon Jul 20 02:02:23 2015 UTC,Except we won mainly because of him this game.

Just because Xmithie performed some what decent on 1 champion this whole split, suddently he's good? But why do i even bother arguing, he will be exposed really bad against a real jungler, like he was against Rush and Move."
CLG,3dvet8,brblifting,-13,Mon Jul 20 02:03:04 2015 UTC,He had ONE good ulti this game that wasn't a bodyslam flash play (which are absurdly easy to hit and so I'm not counting them). Which is one more then we are used to him having so I'm actually cautiously more optimistic.  Perhaps xmithie is still improving.
CLG,3dvet8,Malasartes,2,Mon Jul 20 10:25:06 2015 UTC,"He also had that amazing flank on Incarnation and isolating him from the team using his ult allowed 2 kills for 1 and baron ( I think) I do hope he has more picks than gragas tho, it seems like it's his go to champ at the moment (can be easy banned)"

CLG,3dviuc,AznSparks,8,Mon Jul 20 02:53:53 2015 UTC,It is not a very good decision to play Huhi now because we want to get that Bye for playoffs. If anything Huhi is probably going to rid the bench until next year or worlds.
CLG,3dviuc,ADelicateOrange,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:20 2015 UTC,Didn't we already get a bye by going 2-0 this weekend? Genuine question
CLG,3dviuc,Finalwingz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:08 2015 UTC,"No, we are tied for second place with TL and TIP. Any one of us 3 could get the bye. GV and TSM are a game ahead and behind us respectively.  This means that, assuming we go 2-0 and both TL/TIP win on saturday, the winner of the TL v TIP match on Sunday will play us for a tiebreaker at the first round bye.    Another realistic scenario is if GV beats TiP, then TiP beat TL. Then we just have to go 2-0 against DIG/T8 to guarantee the first round bye."
CLG,3dviuc,Atlatica,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"No. TL and TSM can still take the bye from us if we go 2-0 and we go 0-2, possibly 1-1 for TL from losing team tiebreakers. Dont quote me on the 1-1 tho"
CLG,3dviuc,ADelicateOrange,6,Tue Jul 21 15:17:27 2015 UTC,I don't think that we'll get to see Huhi anytime soon. Judging by the interview CLG think they have the best 5 possible going forward.
CLG,3dviuc,Zigaza,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:17:47 2015 UTC,which is sad because pobelter has been playing aight but not like good enough to go up against any of the top chinese/korean teams' mids.  i hoped huhi was good enough to
CLG,3dviuc,brblifting,3,Mon Jul 20 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Im not saying pobelter is the best mid na but he is pretty good,pobelter is playing mid but is left on an Island,he never gets any jungle pressure but he still manages to go even in lane,today on azir he played like a god in the team fights and Carried(imo) even though he got hard camped by hai"
CLG,3dviuc,WFXFeary,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:26:28 2015 UTC,He does get jungle pressure. Ganking isn't the only way that the jungles can give pressure mid. Xmithie has really good ward control and vision denial around mid that's good for Pobelter because he's so aggressive. The reason he lost lane today is because he misplayed levels 2-4 and Xmithie had to stay in lane body blocking spears so he didn't die.
CLG,3dviuc,Innovativename,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree, he was camped really hard and even Lemon came up for a 3 man gank. Hai's Poor CS showed that he was more concerned with harrassing POB and getting Incarnati0n fed than anything. POB did tilt hard in lane, but he made so many clutch plays in teamfights (as did everyone) that their team synergy is obviously great."
CLG,3dviuc,GRESON2015,0,Mon Jul 20 13:32:18 2015 UTC,i love how everyone just takes the last game nly and forgets the rest.  pobelter got dumpstered and incarnations teamfighting was way better
CLG,3dviuc,brblifting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:53 2015 UTC,yeah his laningphase was really bad but his teamfight was better than incarnation imo
CLG,3dviuc,WFXFeary,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:47 2015 UTC,incarnation's teamfighting/skirmishing was reaching korean levels that game... I don't know if incarnation can keep this up but for that particular game i disagree
CLG,3dviuc,brblifting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:15 2015 UTC,?? POB carried the late game teamfights bro.. Not sure if SRS?
CLG,3dviuc,AdmiralBeetus,0,Tue Jul 21 12:25:41 2015 UTC,am srs  not gonna argue with you about it though either. You people will claim pobelter is a god until he makes a mistake that a bronze would notice (like Link's lissandra ult). I've seen him make a ton of mistakes so far that aren't as obvious and that's why I am not excited about him.
CLG,3dviuc,brblifting,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"He got dumpster'd in lane due to misplays, mistakes, and Hai's pressure. No one is arguing that, but he absolutely did work in the team fights. In the first big team fight when clg was 5k down. He single handedly removed Hai and Sneaky after Xmithie seperated the team. And in the last team fight, he trapped C9 in the baron pit.   I think it's great to make note of the bad plays, of which he did a lot of in lane, but I don't think it's fair to downplay the successes either. I think you should go back and watch the streamables and focus on POB in the teamfights."
CLG,3dviuc,AdmiralBeetus,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:15 2015 UTC,Huhi has already played in the OGN if we're talking experience.
CLG,3dviuc,GiveAQuack,10,Sun Jul 19 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"He got kicked in the groups stage without winning a single game out of the 3 he played, so it's not like he has immense experience or something. CLG should and probably wanted to play him earlier in the season, but the Visa problems fucked him up for a couple weeks.   By the time he came, Pob was playing pretty well + the team probably barely scrimmed with Huhi. And now is way too late to play him because all this games are way too important to use them to try players out. Pob has had a horrible week, minus a couple beautiful teamfights this last game, so it would have been a good moment to put Huhi in, but I don't even know if they are scrimming with Huhi at the moment...   If they are, they might try something last week. I doubt he'll see play in playoffs if he doesn't play next week, to respond to OP."
CLG,3dviuc,3threes3,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:51 2015 UTC,Even before that Pob said he has better laning than Huhi so until he improves I doubt we'll see him.
CLG,3dviuc,Innovativename,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:52 2015 UTC,He needs practice and play time so he's not rusty. That's what OP meant... I think.
CLG,3dviuc,A-Bronze-Tale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:55:52 2015 UTC,He referenced CS experience so I thought he was talking about stage performance.
CLG,3dviuc,GiveAQuack,3,Sun Jul 19 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing this but unless he is out performing Pob and wins the spot I don't see a reason for him to play. I know SKT does it but that is the exception to the rule.  You don't bench Tom Brady or Aaron Rogers for their backup just to get them some game time in a game that matters. The only time you see subs for the experience is when the game doesn't matter. All of CLG's games matter. You play the players that give you the best chance of winning, until winning doesn't matter.  Fanatic could do this, but no one else right now."
CLG,3dviuc,rtothewin,3,Mon Jul 20 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"The best chance for Huhi to play is to play vs T8, but, I'm not even sure he'll get to see that because CLG is still in the running for a bye."
CLG,3dviuc,ImperialDeath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a horrible idea. Keep Pob playing, don't change something that doesn't need changing."
CLG,3dviuc,Izarst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"No, we need to save Huhi for Playoffs because he will obviously have learnt some epic celebrations from FBH."
CLG,3dviuc,Ansibled,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"After seeing how well this starting team roster played from behind it made me realize that they have insane synergy together. As much as I would like to see Huhi come in, I think they need to go with what works best for the team. So yeah I don't think we will see Huhi even in playoffs, pretty sure his Visa issues screwed up practice."
CLG,3du2ss,Ansibled,9,Sun Jul 19 13:58:32 2015 UTC,C9 are looking pretty good in their last two games. Their current standing does not properly represent their skill or challenge to upper ranked teams. I still think CLG got this hands down but C9 should not be underestimated.
CLG,3du2ss,GRESON2015,7,Sun Jul 19 15:08:59 2015 UTC,It was NME and DIG(who is wildly inconsistent and had no coach). We might be overestimating C9. Let's see what happens when they can't mechanically outplay their opponents early game.
CLG,3du2ss,Anthonysan,3,Sun Jul 19 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"This is what I am thinking too, I would still not underestimate C9 with Hai's shot calling now that they have had a few weeks together.  They did win against lower tier/DIG with no coach but still they were sub 30 min decisive wins. Like I said though, I think CLG has this."
CLG,3du2ss,GRESON2015,2,Sun Jul 19 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"They beat a slumping dignitas who didn't have a coach and NME, don't read too much into those wins"
CLG,3du2ss,Wafflezlolqt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed,  With hai directing the team this could actually be a tough match.  However we've been working hard and after that win vs TL I think we have a decent chance."

CLG,3du2ss,please_help_me____,8,Sun Jul 19 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"hai went devourer shyvana because a dog can play shyvana, and hai's champion pool is rek'sai. I wouldn't read too far into it."

CLG,3du2ss,Wafflezlolqt,4,Sun Jul 19 15:39:18 2015 UTC,Right. Flarez giving up solo kills left and right and then a Yi vs. an Ahri. Terrible drafting and individual play by NME. We beat NME in 28 minutes last week. Not a big deal.
CLG,3du2ss,Anthonysan,4,Sun Jul 19 15:58:45 2015 UTC,"NME is an atrocious team, and Flarez has been on tilt for weeks. If CLG plays at yesterday's level, they shouldn't have a terrible time against C9.  Pobelter will hold his own vs incarnation, rush hour > sneakylemon, zion >>> balls.

CLG,3du2ss,HoldMyStone,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"You're correct, Riven bursts Rumble easily. Hopefully, they pull out the Riven today. Since, Riven still hasn't been played in NA LCS."
CLG,3du2ss,yema96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not afraid of Balls's Rumble at all. He played well on Rumble for all of one game this split, and that was against NME/Flarez, who was probably still on tilt since Zion shit all over him last week."
CLG,3du2ss,meta4our,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"Flarez is garbo, he's the worst top laner in NA LCS with the worst team. I meant the fact that Balls is known to land game-changing Rumble Equalizers, and being behind in gold doesn't mean much if you can land good Equalizers, so even if Zion stomps Balls, Balls can still do something. He played pretty good in the first game of this split vs TSM."

CLG,3dtdb0,budgingpandora,36,Sun Jul 19 07:04:50 2015 UTC,"""Zion is pretty fucking bad""  Thats a little over the top."
CLG,3dtdb0,StewPidaz,45,Sun Jul 19 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"Saint is salty as all hell whenever he watches CLG. He even streams himself on twitch whenever CLG is playing a weaker team in LCS because he hates seeing them win.  Like, scroll to any point of the video and Zion is just dominating Quas. 62 to 24 CS discrepancy and 1-1 vs 0-2. ""Oh man Quas is infinitely better than Zion, Zion is such a bad player"". That bait towards the end by Zion won CLG the game and then Saint is in tears going full manchild. I honestly thought after all these years he'd have finally have grown up from that insubordinate douche who bullied Hotshot when he was in charge; he hasn't grown a damn bit."
CLG,3dtdb0,RobertCarlos,17,Sun Jul 19 08:31:31 2015 UTC,"his analysis is good but its definitely bias as fuck, when Quas makes a bad tp early in the game he's hmm that was a bad tp, then zion makes one and he's like wtf so random what an idiot"
CLG,3dtdb0,Ninjakkr,-22,Sun Jul 19 09:05:36 2015 UTC,You guys are hella salty.
CLG,3dtdb0,DarthVantos,22,Sun Jul 19 09:56:33 2015 UTC,"And?  This was a garbage review.  You don't even need to watch league to see his clear hate for clg, zion took a massive shit on quas but saint kept calling zion awful and idiot. Sure the win wasn't clean but seriously? The guy was up by like 70 cs how is that awful?  Jokes oh him.  They're tied for 2nd and his coaching a shitty cs team"
CLG,3dtdb0,kimmjongfun,2,Sun Jul 19 10:22:29 2015 UTC,"Zion took a massive shit on Quas because CLG as a team outplayed TL at level 1 (Rush Hour setting TL's double jungle horribly behind) and after swapping back lanes (forcing Quas to cancel Zion's TP and losing a huge wave of XP/Gold).   Likewise, Zion and CLG's decision making AFTER that point was questionable, though not as bad as Saint makes it seem.   Zion roams down to dragon hoping to catch a flank and start a teamfight again and force Quas to lose another wave. Not a misplay by CLG, but a safe choice by TL to not commit down into the river. Had they tried to contest dragon harder, Fizz flank could have definitely resulted in a won teamfight for CLG. Opportunity cost was ~20 CS for Quas. Given that CLG kept the 5th dragon timer rolling I'd say that's a reasonable trade. Zion TP to TL wraith bush to attempt a dive onto TL mid inner turret. Again, CLG wants to start a fight but TL plays safe enough to avoid the full engage. Biggest loss is Zion's TP pressure, as Saint rightly points out.   Now the bigger issue, and one that I thought Saint should have criticized MUCH more than Zion's decision making, is Pobelter's poor positioning and constantly getting caught. The first at 2nd dragon, he should have pathed behind dragon into CLG's red buff jungle, and if necessary Arcane Shift into the pit once a full fight breaks out. Him getting caught delayed CLG's Dragon stacking. If CLG had taken that dragon (2-0 at that point), then TL may have felt much more pressured to fight the next dragon (Zion's roam to mid has a bigger chance to succeed). Instead, TL ties dragon 1-1 and feels fine conceding the next dragon (2-1) and Fizz can't find any good flank targets.  Then the Baron fight, Pobelter again is too far forward and gets bursted by Viktor and finished off by Quas flank. Saint here focuses heavily on Zion's poor TP location, saying he should have TP'd onto the ward in Baron pit. But the real culprit here is Pobelter, because even if Zion had a better TP, he would already be coming into a 4v5 fight where TL could easily pull back and dump on him once he comes in, while the rest of CLG has to deal with Pob's death and Hecarim in their back line. TBH Zion really salvaged the whole situation by baiting TL around long enough until Pobelter's revive (Saint also missed his huge Trueshot Barrage that literally took out 75% of Fenix's HP) and gave CLG baron control.  So to wrap up, Zion had some poor plays that maybe CLG as a team tried to call as a whole, but makes Zion look bad because he is the one that has to initiate the fights. Saint sees that and over-criticizes it (which is strange because him being a former pro, should guess that CLG as a team is making those calls), while mostly overlooking Pobelter's poor play that hurt CLG much more overall."
CLG,3dtdb0,recursion8,4,Sun Jul 19 14:18:36 2015 UTC,You're wrong about the baron fight. It's not mispositioning when the enemy team has to burn three flashes and two ults to get to you. The only mistake by him was the dragon fight.
CLG,3dtdb0,Malasartes,0,Sun Jul 19 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"He was well out in front of his tankline. That's mispositioning. The only way Viktor should ever be able to flash+Ult onto an Ez is if he flashes into the middle of your team.  Just to be clear, I'm not talking about the fight where CLG trades 2 for 2 with Doublelift autoing safely in CLG's blue nook (though Pob also fucked that fight up too, CLG should not have been going even in fights with a gold lead). I'm talking about the final fight where TL took a top inner turret off a clean 1 for 0 and nearly would have had Baron if not for Zion leading them on a wild goose chase."
CLG,3dtdb0,recursion8,0,Sun Jul 19 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"Chill, tbh. Saint gets higher than a dickens when he makes these reviews.  The fact that the r/lol subreddit takes his ramblings serious is disconcerting, but seeing r/clg take it to heart is frustrating."
CLG,3dtdb0,tiny-timmy,-4,Sun Jul 19 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yet when he was calling everyone idiots last time everyone seemed to have no problem with it. Then when we win it becomes a problem again.  Saint says dumb shit all the time, but i don't understand how it makes you so salty."
CLG,3dtdb0,DarthVantos,-5,Sun Jul 19 12:29:27 2015 UTC,"Just clg fans acting dumb. When Saint was shitting on the entire team when we lost to gravity (Aphromoo only smart player, etc, etc) everyone was like ""yeah he's so right!""  I'm willing to bet real money if zion's bait failed we'd be tearing Zion a new one and agreeing with every word Saint says."
CLG,3dtdb0,Desslochbro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:15 2015 UTC,"No, that's just because people love Aphromoo and the only comments like that I saw were on /r/leagueoflegends not /r/clg"

It's on a low cooldown anyway so missing it doesn't matter too much. It's a weird projectile too, imo."
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,-14,Mon Jul 20 02:17:29 2015 UTC,And you can tell all that from watching a review video? Someone else needs to grow up as well.  He's streaming. It's his job to be controversial. Drama attracts viewership and he's just doing that by throwing around some hyperbolic statements.
CLG,3dtdb0,hyphenscuttle,9,Mon Jul 20 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"His ""job"" is to coach a challenger team. He had some good points, but pretty much the entire video was how ""terrible CLGs rotations"" were or how Zion ""is so awful"". Not once did he make a hyperbolic statement about Liquid. Just seems ridiculously biased against CLG for some reason, maybe because Hotshot denied him the coaching spot."
CLG,3dtdb0,Diminitiv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:45:19 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt he's salty about coaching CLG,yeah he did seem bias towards the end but before that all he did was praise clg for their p/b while saying tl lost it then talk about how clg won the game in the first 10 mins."
CLG,3dtdb0,pinkyxbrain,2,Sun Jul 19 09:14:43 2015 UTC,"TBH I like Limes' coaching but we need more analysts, and Saint is obviously not going to pull punches. If he can reel back the bias and be civil he'd be an awesome analyst and streamer for CLG."
CLG,3dtdb0,OrangeC_rush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:23:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he's pretty damn smart and a veteran too. We definitely need more League-related coaches like Liquid has."
CLG,3dtdb0,Diminitiv,6,Sun Jul 19 14:01:00 2015 UTC,"Despite winning vs Quas, Zion didn't pressure his advantage as much as he could, he missed a lot of ultimates and let some free kills go. Xmithie also played very badly and missed a shit ton of Body Slams and nearly cost them a fight when he was caught out near Baron.   A win is a win but some wins are better than others. This one didn't feel very clean to me, like all the wins we've been getting, lately."
CLG,3dtdb0,hyphenscuttle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"He snowballed a cs lead of like 10-15 into 70. Even if his roams could have been a lot better, it's not like Hecarim was ever gonna get back into the game. I believe Zion could have been like 5/1 or 6/1 by the end of the game instead of 3/1 if he got some good ults on priority targets. Still rekt Quas though so I'm happy about it..."
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,0,Sun Jul 19 08:49:09 2015 UTC,"Uhh that's not even a real analysis. He hit almost all of them and missed 2-3 which doesn't even matter because Fizz ultimate is 45 second CD. Zikn did well this game lol, why is everyone hating?"
CLG,3dtdb0,CLG_Portobello,-13,Mon Jul 20 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"Their comp had no synergy. They are clearly being run by aphro right now and simply playing what they think will work. Find me another  team running these comps and then we can talk about whether or not someone's performance was up to par or not.   Also, it's Xmithie. Zion won the game mostly himself with help from Double. Saint is a salty turd."

CLG,3dtdb0,CLG_Portobello,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:26:28 2015 UTC,Zion > Impact > Quas. Impact hasn't done nearly as much as Zion has ro prove he's the best in NA.
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,2,Sun Jul 19 14:29:56 2015 UTC,"Zion is better than Impact and Quas at least in terms of mechanics(he solo'd both of them) and his ults have been equal or better than both of them(remember Quas choked vs. TSM and 1-man ulted the tankiest member). Impact hasn't been that important in TiP's winstreak, it's really just the XWX&Rush show with some support&cleanup from the sidelanes. I do think that Zion's tps need a little work, but if you see how many bad tps there are in NA toplane you'll notice that pretty much every1 uses tp suboptimally. Still, I agree Zion's the best toplaner in NA!"
CLG,3dtdb0,CLG_Portobello,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:35:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed but I think his TPs are still better than other top laners. Quas and Balls had 0 impact with their TPs, Dyrus literally did nothing with 2 globals but Clg almost always gets a kill and objective whenever zion Tps"
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"I could make a montage of the shitty TP's that Dyrus makes, you should watch Montecristo's criticism of them on twitch if they're available.

In the matchup vs haunter he is down 30 cs and 0 and 2, against a support top like Nautilus.   He plays an OK fizz and can't really even use his lead to close out very easily. Zion has just been consistently average. If our goal is to go to worlds, we should definitely look for a new top in the off season if we fizzle in the playoffs again."
CLG,3dtdb0,AlmightyArrogance32,2,Sun Jul 19 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe in a protect the ADC comp, the whole team allowed Shen to walk up and taunt. All 5 players had CC or snare, and no one did anything."
CLG,3dtdb0,elitewarrior5420,2,Sun Jul 19 15:18:46 2015 UTC,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
CLG,3dtdb0,brblifting,-11,Sun Jul 19 17:50:58 2015 UTC,no... if you turn off your fanboy goggles and honestly look at zion's play you see why he would say this
CLG,3dtdb0,kewlcumber,9,Sun Jul 19 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's the shotcaller's job to point out the win condition and play accordingly. It's the shot caller who decided that instead of snowballing top and letting Fizz carry, Fizz should just randomly look for flanks with roams and teleport to start fights. Now if Zion IS the shot caller, then that is his fault. But if Aphro is making these calls, then he needs to take a close look at how he messed up this game. However, Zion's TP in mid lane for the baron fight was terrible, he had so many wards for flank. TL blew literally everything on POB, Fizz flank would have won CLG the game right there.   Edit: Also, I do not think Saint is being biased here. The shotcaller should have looked to isolate Fizz and Hecarim as much as possible to snowball the Fizz and completely deny Hecarim. There was no need for Zion to roam mid for dragon. If he stuck with Hecarim, he could deny Hecarim farm. If Hecarim decides to TP, Fizz can match his TP and be more useful in the teamfight. Fizz teleporting for homeguard flank at mid was also bad because they don't need to make the risky plays when they can just win by isolating the top laners. Shotcaller should have realized this. And if you DO decide to make a flank homeguard teleport play, you need to have the confidence to just go in when the enemy top just walks to your brush to ward it. If Zion just fishes Hecarim as Hecarim walks to the brush, he can fuck TL up. Even if Heca flashes or ULTs away from Fizz, Fizz has homeguard+ pole+ dash to chase him into the teamfight. If Janna stops him, Alistair successfully dives. If Janna stops Alistair, Fizz succeeds in his dive. You can't peel from both sides. It was Zion's hesitation that screwed up the mid teleport play that they should not have gone for in the first place."
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,2,Sun Jul 19 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"Zion could have snowballed harder, but it was CLG's 2v1+Zion's early play that got CLG a comfortable early game position. Even though Zion got ganked and died, he kept Hecarim down super hard and made the game 5v4 . I would have preferred if Zion kept laning vs. Hecarim and Xmithie counter-gank IWD because CLG's 2v2 would be way stronger. Bad call honestly."

CLG,3dtdb0,manmanman09,7,Sun Jul 19 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"yeah it wasn't the cleanest of wins, but it was a win against TL. Should give us some confidence back. We know we CAN beat TL and don't just roll over when we play against them. That's progress in my opinion. Also was good to see that we finally got a lead on them in the early game. I feel like when they are playing against TSM/TL they just go even in the early game even though we are supposedly the best early game team."
CLG,3dtdb0,Haethos,16,Sun Jul 19 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"Really did seem like we could've won that game a lot more cleanly if Zion had leveraged his early advantage better. Same deal with Pob and his positioning in teamfights, not really sure why he is always so far forward/out of position and needing to blow everything to escape.   After watching Saint review the VOD, it really felt like Liquid had basically erased that CLG early lead and were in a good position to eventually take the game -- that is, until they chased Zion waaay too far and challenged at Baron.  Not a clean win, but a win's a win. God knows we've lost games in way dumber ways."
CLG,3dtdb0,CLG_Portobello,3,Sun Jul 19 10:32:21 2015 UTC,That doesn't even make sense. How is Zion going to leverage his advantage after CLG already did so by gaining a huge lead then almost throwing it? Everyone is always so critical of Zion but never look at how garbage or how badly other top laner play. Seraph never got shit from this community and look how badly Quas played.
CLG,3dtdb0,Haethos,2,Sun Jul 19 07:44:01 2015 UTC,"CLG gave Zion a huge lead, but then he threw it away. Saint pointed out multiple times where he tried to roam or do a random TP play which gave up a TON of map pressure and TP advantage (and also let Quas back into the game). On top of that, his teamfighting wasn't great either -- Saint pointed out a fight near baron where (1) he was late to the fight and (2) picked an awful ward to TP too, so he had zero impact on the teamfight.   Quas actually had a good game, considering how fucked he was in the first ten minutes. By the end, he had made up most of the CS differential between himself and Zion and he was playing his role in teamfights well, using TP to flank CLG and kill Pob after he blew his summoners and escapes."
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"Quas makes 1 play the whole game = Quas actually had a good game? If Quas just avoided that Fizz ult early by backing up and waiting for his team to help, the game could have went in the complete opposite direction. Quas would have gotten XP, an extra 8 CS and possibly a kill credit. Instead, Quas went on to free farm and get back into the game while Zion tried to make plays across the map. Monte's called Zion out before trying to force plays across the map in his vod reviews, but I think it's a team call for him to go around and make plays off Aphro&Xmithie's wards. I personally think trying to force plays is better than sitting in top-lane waiting to get ganked all day because you're ahead and this is a playstyle that CLG embraces. If CLG can polish up their communication/initiation I think CLG can start turning those top advantages into double-kills/dragons/etc. A win is a win, although I disagree that Quas had a good game because he just free farmed and then jumped onto Pob with his 600MS Hecarim and killed. On the other hand, Zion's solokill had a much greater effect on the game because it denied more CS and created SOME pressure on other parts of the map."
CLG,3dtdb0,Haethos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"Quas came back from a deficit that should've made him irrelevant and became a force that secured two key teamfights in the midgame. If he had not been able to take out Ezreal and Pob was able to kite and add damage from distance, those fights could've been a lot different.   What exactly did Zion do well that game? CLG forced Quas into having to make a lose/lose decision (stopping Zion's TP and getting super chunked or matching TP's and fighting a teamfight while being underfarmed) and Zion turned that into a big lead. After that? A lot of really underwhelming roaming attempts and bad teamfighting. Look at how many times he missed his ultimate, or just threw it out in situations where, even if it landed, he wouldn't have been able to kill the target (I'm thinking of the ones he missed in midlane/top red jungle, outside baron pit, onto completely shielded (from janna and viktor q) viktor, etc. Keep in mind that by the time we had lost the teamfight and Liquid had rotated to take tier 2 top tower, we had basically lost that big lead and were even with Liquid at best.   I like Zion a lot and I think Saint is really biased towards Quas since they used to be teammates. That being said, Zion shouldn't be immune from criticism -- there are plenty of things for him to work on. I'm not saying that he is a shit toplaner who should be replaced -- I actually like him a lot and think he has been really good for the team."
CLG,3dtdb0,ayylemaokai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:46 2015 UTC,"Quas killed Pobelter in one fight when Pobelter was pretty much doing 1 thing the whole game: chunking with Ezreal ult and that's all he was useful for. Pobelter was pretty useless in fights because his positioning was bad. I  think you're giving Quas a bit too much credit for that, that's all.  Zion does misplay because he tries to force plays and ended up missing his ult, but really his ult was not super important in the game because he's bruiser Fizz. The bigger issue here, imo, was that the call was made not to continually camp Hecarim, but to try to force low % plays. Both players are great toplaners though."
CLG,3dtdb0,OurNameIsLegion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"I just want to make a comment about this ""Quas played like shit"".  Yes, Quas got completely fucked in lane and couldn't CS for much of the early game but that had absolutely nothing to do with him. Rush Hour's invade set them so far behind and by the time they had broken the tier 1 turret, there was nowhere on the map left for Quas to farm without dying. Even under his tier 2 turret he got dove in a 1 for 1 but that dive by Zion denied him another 12 minions and basically won the game from that. Quas actually did a really good job farming like crazy in the midgame so that he could build items and not be a liability for his team. CLG played like shit letting him get away with farming and only getting two turrets in return."

CLG's plan going into the game was solid, but their execution of it after the early game was pretty bad. They had plenty of mechanical misplays too.  Beating a good team doesn't automatically mean the game was really well-played. Quite frankly, Liquid played very badly that game."
CLG,3dtdb0,actzlol,3,Sun Jul 19 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"people in this subreddit just reading comments and bandwagoning without watching the vod review. saint made many arguments as to why he thinks zion didn't play as optimally as he did with his lead. i mean if you watch it, you will realized that zion did not play as well as he could of. i love zion but some points saint is right. i mean he has fact right infront of him."
CLG,3dtdb0,actzlol,6,Sun Jul 19 13:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I said he made really good points, but he ruins them by ending his argument with a harsh judgemental opinion like ""zion is pretty fucking bad""."

CLG,3dsjba,brblifting,0,Sun Jul 19 13:05:25 2015 UTC,I feel like zion is still wasting his flash or in this case his ult and spells too much. Also not a great game by pobelter but rush hour carried the game with trist alistar.
CLG,3dsjba,ayylemaokai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"Did you see how hard Zion was destroying Quas with his early game advantage of like 11 CS? And then he solo-killed him for first blood under 2nd tier tower and even though he died he still denied Quas another 8 CS that Quas really needed&got first blood gold. Yeah he missed some ults, but Fizz fish is a weird projectile. Zion was also really annoying in team fights; with his CDR he was constantly jumping around and avoiding death very slimly in teamfights.  CLG did a great job of playing around top early game(because bot was winning&mid was even) and then Doublelift just destroyed Liquid in the late game. Pobelter's positioning was bad and he needs to work on it, but still Viktor has insane dmg. At least Pobelter's poke helped with the siege comp."
CLG,3dsjba,brblifting,-7,Sun Jul 19 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"zionspartan's early cs advantage was because of strategic decisions by CLG's shotcaller (aphromoo). And fizz is stronger than hecarim once he gets the advantage he got off the laneswap to where zion is supposed to zone him off the wave (meaning htis was a function of the matchup and aphromoo, not zion's skill).  Quas' team didn't come to help save the lane situation and instead focused on other things, so the cs lead naturally grew. And he didn't play that first blood even close to optimally. Zion always goes for the play but typically wastes cds only sometimes converting."

I don't know who I'd like to play, maybe Axe since he looks like he isn't doing well today given he lost to HugS.

CLG,3dquxf,mint420,0,Sat Jul 18 22:45:07 2015 UTC,so armada is the last winners match?
CLG,3dquxf,TehLittleOne,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"still another round of matches to go.  If PPU can beat Armada, he gets to top 8 and is done for the day.  If he loses, he goes to Loser's bracket and needs to win a couple matches there to reach top 8."
CLG,3dquxf,OmniscientOctopode,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:14:38 2015 UTC,Damn that was close
CLG,3dquxf,brblifting,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:40 2015 UTC,Nice clutch from PPU.
CLG,3dquxf,OmniscientOctopode,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"PewPewU got gifted that set. Javi was playing a lot better and was really bringing it to PewPewU, but Javi choked really hard and made some really bad decisions under pressure.  I think Javi also mistakenly took him to Stadium. He crushed him on Yoshi's and then lost on Stadium after he got counterpicked there. While Stadium might be good for Fox in general, I wouldn't want to take someone back there in this situation. PewPewU liked the space and struggled when Javi was able to be aggressive, and Stadium offered him the space he was looking for.  Hopefully next time Kevin can space a bit better and play to the matchup. There's a great quote from the Smash Doc that really describes how Kevin needs to play: ""[He] is cool as a cucumber.... So when [he] goes nuts with all his craziness, [he] can just wavedash back, fsmash, and just sort of take care of him""."

CLG,3dquxf,crow38,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:16:12 2015 UTC,and??? hes still not that good compared to top players imo
CLG,3dquxf,InterspaceAlien,2,Sun Jul 19 01:19:23 2015 UTC,Ya and? That's what we expected out of him as a player and certainly doesn't make him bad. Theres nothing wring with having a close set with one of the best players of all time and one with a player of the same caliber is.
CLG,3dquxf,Luckyshoot3r,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:22:17 2015 UTC,what u want out of a player and what i want out of a player is very different and i never said he was bad i just said hes not that good
CLG,3dquxf,crow38,2,Sun Jul 19 01:23:39 2015 UTC,Not that good compared to who? He's a step below the gods as is everyone else in the world besides leffen. If you thought there were players of that caliber available you're just not that familiar with melee.
CLG,3dquxf,Luckyshoot3r,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:28:09 2015 UTC,axe was there and they picked ppu. i just hold higher expectations for players when a org picks up a player
CLG,3dquxf,crow38,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"And we saw how close their set was. Axe and ppu are at the same spot in the tier list, axe just had the better set."
CLG,3dquxf,brblifting,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:33:03 2015 UTC,everyone ive talked to includign friends who are in the scene say axe is much better and ppu stated in twitter he has trouble with axe.
CLG,3dquxf,Grick,2,Sun Jul 19 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"He is absolutely not much better. They are definitely comparable. Axe probably has the edge as this is his second evo top 8 but they are both in the ""right below the gods and leffen"" tier. He does struggle with axe but that could be more match up based then anything. People typically give marth a slight edge but ppu seems to really struggle against characters that are more difficult to edgeguard, so that might not be true for him."
CLG,3dqg9w,Ansibled,14,Sat Jul 18 13:27:32 2015 UTC,I really hope we stick with what has been working for us recently (Zion on a carry etc.) instead of trying to pull something new out. I would love to see us beat a top tier team for the first time in a while.

CLG,3dqg9w,VividLatias,4,Sat Jul 18 22:10:16 2015 UTC,this is what I'm worried about the most. Our draft phase has been incredibly poor lately.
CLG,3dqg9w,PM_ME_YOUR_BURDENS,20,Sat Jul 18 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"Every single time you armchair retards say ""oh what a bad draft"" after a game that CLG losses, ACTUAL analysts always say ""oh clgs draft was pretty good this game""  stop pretending like you know anything about PB phase, just because you lose doesnt make your draft bad and just because you win doesnt make your draft good"
CLG,3dqg9w,Wafflezlolqt,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"I still feel like draft has been questionable. It's not even only my opinion, recently on SI Monte was talking about how he felt clg tunnel visioned way too hard in weird picks, which I agree."
CLG,3dqg9w,XiaoRCT,2,Sun Jul 19 04:14:24 2015 UTC,"recently on SI Monte was talking about how he felt clg tunnel visioned way too hard in weird picks   and then he turned back and said ""oh CLG's drafts were actually fine for the most part""   he said that before he even looked at their draft, stop excluding relevant context"
CLG,3dqg9w,Wafflezlolqt,0,Sun Jul 19 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not ""excluding relevant context"", actually, if anyone is doing such thing It is you, Monte never backtracked on his whole statement about clg. He said that about the games in which they went for Rumble. Not ""oh yeah I was wrong clg draft is fine"". From weird picks which Monte could be talking about, we might as well be talking about Lulu, which was criticized on another section of that show."
CLG,3dqg9w,XiaoRCT,2,Sun Jul 19 05:00:52 2015 UTC,Monte really did look at the draft and go 'actually this was a fine draft'. He retracted that particular criticism entirely.
CLG,3dqg9w,IllusiveSelf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"He even follows it up with ""I don't why you would pick jinx"" after talking about the fine draft. He did not meant it for ""clg's draft is actually ok, np"" but for ""this case of clg's draft was fine actually"". I just feel like people who talk about the draft beeing fine are closing their eyes to the problem. CLG spent two weeks picking eve and lulu/protect the dl without beeing able to pull it off. Now, is eve a bad pick? No. But was It a bad pick when you have Xmithie who was unable to pull It off the day before and who was playing her for the first time on stage? Yes."
CLG,3dqg9w,XiaoRCT,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. This place is rampant with ""CLG lost because of bad draft"" when it wasn't even bad half the time.  The worst part is where they blame it on draft, when CLG could have won the game even IF IT WAS a bad draft. But they did something retarded and threw or just got outplayed.  Sorry, but you still have to play the game and adapt even if you had a bad draft."
CLG,3dqg9w,mint420,4,Sat Jul 18 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, CLG didn't lose their last game to TL because of draft. They lost it because xmithie got caught lvl 1 and CLG dove azir and killed 1v4. CLG was winning teamfights/coming out even from behind all game and had they not dove azir they likely would have won the game"
CLG,3dqg9w,Wafflezlolqt,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:27:38 2015 UTC,Well I bet 3/4 of the people saying that they lost to picks and bans all the time are bronze and have the mental capacity of a rock when it comes to understanding picks and bans in a competitive game. Ignore and wait for someone who actually has knowledge bring up if their picks and bans are that shitty.  I don't even care if the casters say it. That's exactly what they are. Casters. Leave the real truth about the picks and bans to the analysts/ present pro players.  TL:DR: don't listen to the bronzies tell you that they had awful picks and bans every game and let the pros and analysts tell you.
CLG,3dqg9w,Briggst09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"also, if you REALLY think about CLGs playstyle, our drafts have been fantastic for getting us what we play well. And usually putting the enemy team into an obvious playstyle because they always rush the meta picks.  But thats just my analysis"
CLG,3dqg9w,Mager1794,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone is giving Fenix too much credit for his 1v4, yeah he made a nice play but it doesn't mean he's an Azir god.... and if CLG's comp is good against Azir, then let Liquid have it."
CLG,3dqg9w,Prot0n-,20,Sat Jul 18 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"Fenix consistently does well on Azir. Even against TSM, his Azir provided so much damage to help close out the game. I wouldn't let him have Azir."
CLG,3dqg9w,ayylemaokai,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's just the fact that it is far and away his best champion, and it is a strong pick overall.  That right there makes it very strong and ban worthy.  Although if they take the Azir and Nunu like they did against NME that would be really nice as well."

CLG,3dqg9w,GriefTheBro,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"GG CLG, happy to see some results. At least this is something. Even if we lose in play offs I think CLG showed this game that they actually were a decent team.   Whatever people say, Doublelift has been a beast all season. He has been playing awesome, I'm not a Doublelift fanboy saying this if anything I was a CLG fan despite of Doublelift. But this split he has proved himself. People say it is so hard for ADCs to stand out and carry in this meta, but Doublelift is without a doubt the strongest carry for CLG.  This is not taking anything away from Pobelter and Zion, they have done very well. I think that despite what a lot of people think, including CLG in the past, the way to make a strong carry shine is to have threats in other lanes. When you have 4 support players and a star it is too easy to focus your one star player.   Of course there is exceptions to this. But generally you should make your team play it out so that your star player makes everyone else shine. Not the other way around. Look at SKT, Faker draws so much attention in bans and in game which lets players like Piglet, Bang and Marin shine. In my opinion they are all good players, but none of them are stars. But they certainly have a carry playstyle which is enabled by Faker giving them the space to be that carry by drawing attention. In a way this has been true for TSM as well, when they were doing the best Bjergsen was the one drawing the attention while Wildturtle got enough slack to become the carry threat that he was very good at being.   In the end, I want to thank CLG for giving us one really good game against a top team. Thank you guys. And especially Doublelift, you are a great tristana."

CLG,3dpgo8,Audunseth,23,Sat Jul 18 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"Many women's teams—including Fnatic Ladies, a short-lived team under the banner of another major esports organization—largely fail because their sponsors no longer support them. The teams also often fly under the community’s radar, as they're given little exposure compared to their male counterparts. With only a handful of women’s tournaments throughout the year, there are few opportunities for female players to perform and win a paycheck.   I don't like how they're wording this as a women's issue, as it's clearly due to the teams just being worse. Lower ""level"" play generally gets less attention unless there's some type of emotional attachment involved, i.e. SC collegiate league in its prime."
CLG,3dpgo8,BananaTissue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna agree there. If female teams were better at the game than male teams then I highly doubt that tournaments would still be focused around the latter.

After another ESWC championship, they've got their sights set high. “I would like our team to be one of the best teams in the world,” says Harvey. “No gender segregation.”    Last time I checked, CS:GO has no gender segregation requirements in its tournaments. So what is keeping women competing with men? Their skill level. I am so sick of articles like these, and players when they come into contact with the female sex. Why does it always have to be some woman issue or female sex issue? You want equality? Then stop highlighting your own sex all the time, and get better at the game."

CLG,3dnxtv,The-Loracks,4,Sat Jul 18 00:46:16 2015 UTC,If they don't ban or first pick Azir they should fire Ziks. Honestly that will be the defining thing to justify letting him go
CLG,3dnxtv,Grizzly_Magnum_,2,Sat Jul 18 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely like banning Azir. Most players tend to agree Kog is good against Azir, and that's the matchup we keep seeing. But from what keeps happening, I just don't see Kog being that good against him. He's squishy and can be abused in the early-mid game. Last time we played that matchup against TSM, Bjergsen poked POB out of lane before dragons and it hurt. I'd rather us just ban it because of how good Fenix is on it"
CLG,3dnxtv,TehLittleOne,3,Sat Jul 18 00:58:56 2015 UTC,j4 is good vs azir. GV has beaten a few azir's that way.
CLG,3dnxtv,PandaCodeRed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:16:14 2015 UTC,If we get Ez we could play around Azir. Long range poke > Azir.
CLG,3dnxtv,recursion8,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"That's the point to the Kog'Maw pick. Kog has better long range poke than Ez, and it doesn't rely on having a clear path the way Ez does. I don't know whether Ez being safer makes enough of a difference. The other thing is that if you're picking Ez as an Azir counter, and they recognize it, they can play around it. Not that I think it's the worst thing, Ezreal is a very safe and versatile champion and doesn't get countered as badly as some champs do.  The thing is though, you really need to draft a comp that is going to shut down the Azir hard. Fenix is very good on that champion and if we pigeon hole ourselves into beating Azir, it could mess up the draft. It's definitely not that you can't beat Azir, but that in doing so, it makes it easy for the enemy team to play around your picks."

CLG,3dnxtv,Leeeopaard,9,Sat Jul 18 14:16:46 2015 UTC,"Azir is one of the strongest, if not THE strongest, champions in the mid lane right now. If you give it to players that are masters of it (Bjerg/FeniX.... even POB has shown that he can perform on Azir against TSM) of COURSE you will have problems winning late game unless you have a good solution to dealing with his kit.   Azir is just a devastating champion in the right hands. (Insane burst/sustained damage, incredible CC, sand soldiers have good range, can hop over walls, etc. etc.) CLG almost won the first game against TSM despite losing all 3 lanes early due to the strength of Azir."
CLG,3dnxtv,Klaud9,-8,Fri Jul 17 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"i agree with u nygguh , but the question is ... CLG don't know how to play against Azir for now... Since this champ has show you power on competitive cene, few times i see CLG do something right against him  :( ... while i'm watch other regions they can do something against this focking champ and its not easy at all but they can win some games ... ( SORRY MY ENGLISH )"
CLG,3dnxtv,Leeeopaard,3,Fri Jul 17 22:09:37 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean (I think). It's not really the Azir pick that made them lost last game, it's the fact they went for a bad dive against him that cost the game; who knows how the game would have went if CLG decided not to dive or execute it better. Same deal with TSM vs Liquid: TSM didn't lose because of the Azir pick, they lost because of that Baron steal that shouldn't have happened in the first place and because of their questionable itemization.  I do think that Azir is still a good ban against Fenix because banning the best champion of a player is certainly always a good idea, but I don't really think that he's unstoppable as reddit makes it to be. It just seems that when he picks him, teams that play against it makes some questionable plays and mistakes."

CLG,3dmkz2,EliahBernick,27,Fri Jul 17 14:20:36 2015 UTC,"I really love Monte and his analysis usually but this really just showed me that they don't look at any stats in depth when talking about NA/EU teams. There are some critiques they could have said about CLG that are valid and actually point out their issues (and guess what it isn't DL). I wanted to refrain from posting such a long response but I feel it needs to be said as this is what they can actually critique CLG on.   I am not an esport analyst but I do have a statistician background. Based on reviewing game stats from the season these are the issues I think are holding them back (take these as they are, ideas drawn from extremely under sampled data, which is the reason I was hesitant to post this):  1)  The biggest issue that is easy to see when looking at stats is that CLG has not been able to play from behind well this season, having only won one game where they were down in gold at 10 mins. (against TIP 1st time and that was only -310 gold). This tells me that when behind they are picking fights or getting picked on when behind before they hit power spikes and need to learn to rotate defensively to avoid this. They also overstay to get objectives when behind, many times you can see in the games they lost that they will take a tower, dragon, baron, etc only to lose 3+ kills for it (not a positive EV exchange for them). The 1st game vs TSM really showcases this as they could have won it after they got baron if they would have used that advantage wisely but they wanted to keep pushing as hard as possible going for a huge tower dive only to be wiped after.   2)  They play sloppy with extremely large leads (2k+ at 10 mins, 5K+ at 20, etc). This has happened a few times, NME 1st time, TDK 1st time, TIP 2nd time. They go from having a huge gold %  lead to letting it slip away by playing out of position or not pushing extreme leads by grouping and keeping vision up.   3)  The largest issue is their mental block against TL and TSM, it is pretty apparent that they not only pick different but even lay very passive in lane against these two teams. Often having CS@10 differentials in lane way worse than against any other team. This could be due to picks as well and the first blood give aways by Xmithie last time made them just have to farm and play passive so the stats are extremely swayed.  None of this is touched on by Monte or Thorin and are easy to see by looking at the #’s a little more in depth. I honestly think that show is more about general statements that back up Reddit comments for views than actual in depth analysis of teams."
CLG,3dmkz2,GRESON2015,57,Fri Jul 17 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"2 out of 14 games this season they have played ""Protect the Doublelift"" = They are back to only playing Protect the Doublelift.  What?"
CLG,3dmkz2,Brot90,40,Fri Jul 17 14:56:02 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the Trist comps are not anything like the old Trist hard carry comps. She is more of a waveclear/seige champ now. I think it is odd to say that is DL old comp style when it fits more of a support role than a carry role now.  I really respect Monte as an Analyst, but people give him far too much credit when it comes to NA/EU teams. On SI he reularly pulls stats off of the LCS website when talking about NA/EU without looking in depth and makes huge sweeping judgement based on that knowledge. I know he watches some of the games and he is incredible with Korean stats and game knowledge but on NA and EU his team knowledge lacks a bit."
CLG,3dmkz2,GRESON2015,25,Fri Jul 17 15:14:06 2015 UTC,really getting tired of people going back to saying dlift is the problem when it seems like he's the only one who plays at a consistent level.
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,17,Fri Jul 17 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"Monte stated that sometimes he can just say things that basically put other people on tilt, nothing to do with his actual play; no one really thinks DL's play is the main problem."
CLG,3dmkz2,mayonaiseking,8,Fri Jul 17 15:24:13 2015 UTC,And I don't doubt that. But that comes down to coaches needing to a)control how much leash to give him b)instill** confidence in the other team members and give them a voice. c) give everyone on the team a time to speak and hear criticism constructively.  I've been apart of sports teams for most of my young adult life. Some team-mates are more competitive than others. I've had team-mates go off on me about a bad pass or a missed goal. And I've gone off on team-mates for the same things. That's going to happen when you're passionate and want to win.   I'm not saying dlift isn't being a bad team-mate at times. I'm saying the coaching staff need to manage the players and their voices better.
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,-4,Fri Jul 17 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"It's very easy to say stuff like that when you're on the outside but the truth is that you have absolutely 0 clue on what goes on within the team, and so do I and everyone else in this sub.   I'm not saying DL is THE problem but when a considerable amount of people within the scene have heard or experienced bad things with/about Doublelift, you can't just dismiss it as if it was nothing.   DL is passionate about winning and a very consistent player. That is not the question. The point is that DL can escalate things up to a point where it creates awkwardness in the team, between players, and that results in a loss of coordination and synergy. He has said himself that he can be blunt at times. It's also pretty easy to say:    Yeah, you just gotta be the coach, get in there and tell people what to do or get benched.   It's not easy to instill structure and discipline when you're the newcomer. When your main coaching staff is made of a guy who's completely new to the competitive scene and a guy who has beta written all over his body cells, there is very little you can do, considering that benching is also a difficult option to take since there is no one else who would be able to play at that level and build synergy with the rest of the team in such a short amount of time, especially in a team like CLG who is heavily dependent on this split's results in order to attend the WCS.    I'll wrap it up by saying that I have no clue on what's going on, same as everyone else in here, but this is why I assume it's not as easy as just saying ""get in there and yell at everyone pz"". It's easy to take control when things are going smooth. When shit goes south, though, the problem becomes much thicker."
CLG,3dmkz2,hyphenscuttle,7,Fri Jul 17 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"That has to be the longest possible way to say absolutely nothing.  Why even concern yourself with how a team is running when you're never going to be able to do anything about it.  Quit running your ignorant mouth nit picking individuals and shit talking on them, especially when it couldn't be further from the truth.  Speaking of beta fucks, you remind me of those fat football fans that talk shit on the players yet run out of breath walking to the fridge and back.  Keep on with your keyboard crusade and patting yourself on the back, while that ""beta"" continues to bust his ass for his team.  Down vote me fuckers, you know it's true!"

CLG,3dmkz2,hyphenscuttle,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:25:58 2015 UTC,"Well sure there are difficulties. That's why it's a job and not a hobby.  And you're right I don't know anything about the inner workings of the team. But I know quite a lot about teams and interacting with team-mates.   I've already said I'm sure dlift is not the greatest team-mate at times, but I think his toxicity is being either massively overstated or incredibly covered up. I believe it's more likely the first.  I think their losses and struggles have a lot more to do with execution and pick and bans than it does a single players affect on their team-mates."
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"There really is no way for us to know if it's massively overstated or incredibly covered up.    It's basically Doublelift's word vs. 3rd parties and if you're a fan of CLG or Doublelift it's more likely you're going to believe whatever he says over the 3rd parties.  Unless all these 3rd parties are out to get Doublelift and ruin his career, I highly doubt it's massively overstated."
CLG,3dmkz2,SamuraiBunnyy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to how much the community overstates it. I'm not denying or questioning what Monte says about it, though thoorin is probably a little dramatic. If it was as bad as many people on reddit claim it to be I doubt we'd be seeing smiling faces on clg all the the time and the amount of joking/camaraderie that seemingly goes on in the house from streams/videos.  Again, I'm not saying it doesn't exist, only that it's being perpetuated more strongly by the community than it is actually affecting the team environment."
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Very good points, but I think there's a difference between work hours and off hours.  I'm sure they don't hate each other which would mean they still enjoy each other's company but when it comes to being co-workers it could be completely different."
CLG,3dmkz2,SamuraiBunnyy,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"It's very easy to say stuff like that when you're on the outside but the truth is that you have absolutely 0 clue on what goes on within the team   And yet you're labeling one of their coaches as beta.  It doesn't matter that their head coach is new to the scene, he was hired to keep egos in check and clearly he's not doing it if Doublelift is still causing his teammates to go on tilt.  It doesn't take being in the scene to be able to tell someone when they're crossing the line.    For the most part I wish more people had the same mentality of you, but your statement is still not free of uninformed comments."
CLG,3dmkz2,SamuraiBunnyy,2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe I shouldn't have worded it that way but by Zikz being beta I mean that he doesn't seem like the kind of person that transmits authority, which is why they had to hire a second coach. Apart from the first weeks of LCS where CLG were destroying bottom teams and everything was ok, we don't know if it worked as intended when things went wrong.  Also, by the ""new to the scene"" thing, I meant that it's very easy for someone to try and be an authority figure but it's also very easy for players with big personalities to adopt some sort of ""Yeah wtf do you know about this game? I don't care what you say."" But still nod their heads in agreement just to shut the coach up."
CLG,3dmkz2,hyphenscuttle,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"That's true.  But the way I see it, he's not there to talk about the game, merely to ensure no one is overstepping boundaries or being more overbearing than others.  Basically to facilitate conflict resolution.  If the players respect him like everyone says they do, it shouldn't be hard for the guy to say ""Hey Peter, you're getting a little worked up."""
CLG,3dmkz2,SamuraiBunnyy,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:52:10 2015 UTC,"yo you know how to cure cancer? just fucking kill the cancer cells.  Its easier said than done, coaches aren't magicians they can't just change a person's personality by coaching them."
CLG,3dmkz2,dy8763kt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"you don't need to be a magician to tell players to shut up wait for their turn and enforce constructive criticism, you just need to put a leach on players that are more aggressive in their comments.  It's really natural in competitive environments to criticize bad plays because you want to improve.  I understand most of these players don't come from a sports background so they probably can't take harsh comments well and they get demotivated/sad. And it's not easy to grow a thick skin at this point in their lives. But you can still as a coach make it so that the criticism is passed in a  better way."

CLG,3dmkz2,myaccount101,8,Sat Jul 18 02:40:46 2015 UTC,"Aphro is a great player, and my favourite member of the team. He is definitely CLG's strongest player during the regular season over the last few splits. Especially when he's given the tools to make plays.  But the only player who consistently puts up numbers during crunch time is Doublelift. In recent past he is the only player who performed to expectation during play-off's. And during their relegation matchs not too long ago he single handedly put the entire team on his back and carried three consecutive games against former gravity/crs academy after already being down 0-2.  But yes Aphro is an incredible support, I hope he gets the chance to shine in play-offs this season."
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,-5,Sat Jul 18 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"But the only player who consistently puts up numbers during crunch time is Doublelift   This myth is really retarded. He has thrown plenty of games in playoffs. When it comes to playoffs CLG just tends to go back to 4 protect 1 comps on Doublelift, making him look good even when his team is losing."
CLG,3dmkz2,myaccount101,3,Sat Jul 18 04:32:57 2015 UTC,mind linking me some of these playoff games you're talking about where CLG is in control and doublelift throws it?
CLG,3dmkz2,Grant113,-6,Sat Jul 18 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"Remember when he got insec'd by crumbz and lost the game on his own vs Dignitas in playoffs?   Who knows why they always to go back to 4 support 1 comps on him in playoffs? Probably because of his ego. Again, there's a reason every ex-CLG player said that he's a horrible team mate, and almost everyone in the scene lately, like Saint and Sneaky, said that he's toxic and a horrible team mate.   But the reason he stays on CLG despite his horrible reputation for so long is because he's huge friends with hotshot."

Try going back and watching their sets against Gravity in Relegation, or Gambit at IPL.  When everybody else is fucking up, he steps up.

Might have heard somewhere that he was the one who called the 4v1 Fenix dive (not sure).  As far as ""tilt"" goes, we've seen Double perform while the rest of the team seems to be playing way below expected. It's just that Aphro is who we need to perform (Xmithie is Xmithie and is useless half the time) otherwise CLG gets nowhere.  Aphro and Xmithie are typically our primary engage roles most of the time and the team suffers heavily when they don't manage to get much done."

Of course, Hotshot has also been there the whole time and he's already accepted the blame for a lot of problems that the team has had as well.  Nothing they said seemed that off though to be honest. If we finished 5th/6th, it would just be continuing the trend of CLG finishing in the middle of the pack again. I hope we can break that trend this year, but it's far from certain."

On the contrary, even Monte said he had a great work ethic and an excellent drive to win. He said that DL had a difficult personality and that he might cause trouble when things start going south.  I highly doubt that Aphromoo, the guy who appears to be friends with everyone and just a complete chill dude, is the root of the possible problems CLG might be having.

And this 'protect the doublelift thing' they played that 2 out of 14 games. Apparently 2/14 = every game now. It's so stupid, this is just memeing around and really thoughtless... Almost want to call it slander jesus"
CLG,3dmkz2,trolz0rs,4,Fri Jul 17 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"They have too many double standards on things. Nobody there was pointing fingers at Flame when Blaze was crumbling. While they usually provide good analysis on issues, there are very often double standards applied to logical conclusions."
CLG,3dmkz2,GiveAQuack,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, a lot of people were trying to blame Flame during/after the fall of Blaze, basically saying he was causing it by insisting on jungle pressure top.  Pretty similar to Link's rant honestly."

CLG,3dmkz2,GiveAQuack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:36:28 2015 UTC,"Well i don't even think its a logical conclusion at all in this case. From everything that we've seen the team atmosphere is much better this season. On top of that i think doublelift is playing really well this season (his teamfight positioning has been much better this season). Even Coach Chris himself has said Doublelift doesn't have an ego so i don't think he's the biggest problem with CLG by a long shot. What CLG lacks is a real team identity currently, now knowing whether they want to play bot/mid/top priority consitently. Doublelift has shown that he plays every ADC the team wants him to play, so i don't think the lack of a real team identity is because of  Doublelift. This is what i see as someone with an 'outside perspective' which thooorin meme'd the shit out of."

CLG,3dmkz2,maurosQQ,0,Sat Jul 18 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"considering thats not an accusation, no that's not what i meant. What they said without any proof whatsoever is that doublelift (be it either his attitude or his ego) is the main problem of CLG.

But from what we've heard from the players it's clear they respect him and listen to him. Don't know if I misunderstood something but that's how it came across to me.
CLG,3dmkz2,ORyanx,8,Fri Jul 17 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, when they were winning. We have no idea what went on when they started losing, though.

CLG,3dmkz2,hyphenscuttle,4,Fri Jul 17 16:15:05 2015 UTC,Except the fact CLG said they had a long talk in interviews after the losses and that coach chris was making them play a shit ton after the losses and working stuff out.

He's been solid on a strong team and that's about it, he still makes positioning mistakes, he doesn't dominate lane as much as Double does and he's not a Bjergsen/Double styled hard carry player. He's just consistently solid.  I don't understand the hype for him really, if he really was as good as everyone think he is, he would have been able to impact C9's split much more than he has.."

Even if Doublelift is the problem, you can't use the idea that Doublelift is the common denominator as the explanation. Aphromoo has been on the team throughout these constant tilts in playoffs, but everyone claims he is great for the team environment. Also 2 games of playing jugger-jinx comps (even though I don't think it was a good  idea to play it) is not enough to say that CLG is already resorting back to protect the Doublelift. Other than a majority of the CLG discussion though, I enjoyed this episode and there were good discussions."

CLG,3dmkz2,ImperialDeath,-6,Fri Jul 17 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"one thing that really stood out to me in this CLG segment is the discussion on if doublelift is the problem, obviously, we all know that he is lacking in the emotional quotient department, and would often say or do things that are detrimental to the team environment, but I feel like all the players on CLG should know this and be able to handle it, like doublelift never means to do harm with his actions, sometimes he is just overly harsh/honest  so the other possible reason why CLG always seem to fail and go back to protect the doublelift is because doublelift himself demands it, which I question on the same spectrum that thoorin questions it, how does doublelift have this much power on the team to get the whole team to do what he says, maybe more passive people like aphro would just quietly go along with whatever double wants to do, but outspoken people like zion? I don't see zion just blindly follow doublelift, and what are the coaches doing, wasn't it said multiple times that the coaches have the final say on things? didn't blurred lime wanted to establish control over the players (who are young adults that need to be controlled as he himself said, I paraphrase), if doublelift has all this power, that control is definitely not there, or at least it's not in blurred's hands, it's in double's"

CLG drafted a good comp to emphasize their strengths and cover their weaknesses, and with the way the game was progressing, CLG very clearly would have won had Link not inexplicably thrown the game.   Considering how mentally volatile CLG is, that one play might have been the difference between CLG tilting off the face of the earth against TL, or overcoming their struggles and being a top NA team."
CLG,3dl1en,Klaud9,6,Fri Jul 17 03:23:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think anybody was too critical of the game 1 pick and ban, just the way it was played out.  It was game 2 and 3 pick ban that people talked about mostly, like Karthus into Juggermaw."

Anyway I don't remember which one it was but at one point tl locked in lulu janna in one rotation. EHM JUGGERMAW. I'd like to see what he says about the following draft that happened there since scarras apology was more directed at that than the game one which the picks and bans were fine for, I don't disagree at all with this guy on G1. The biggest problem there was execution lol....everything leading up was fine but then one person goes and dives rumble (link) while the other (DL iirc) tries to take the turret. Split call. Link dies because he made a very risky agressive call that wasn't followed up on, it wasn't even necessary to do that, just take the damn turret. Meanwhile zion and xmithie either kill/force someone off the top turret and kill ot which was good but then xmithie ran through their red side jungle got caught and since link and possibly DL died bottom and with the jungler dead TL just got baron and having baron buff vs our comp is really fucking bad. Couldn't split push at all, gold lead closed and since they had a tf comp the second they grouped we were fucked since we had a splitpush comp and can't splitpush when they have baron."

CLG,3dk72u,amumulessthan3,2,Fri Jul 17 09:51:08 2015 UTC,CLG isn't the type of org that relies on tourny winnings to generate revenue. They mostly rely on fan base and sponsors and having the (BY FAR) most dominant female cs go team with seemingly likable personalities is very attractive to both the fan base and the sponsors.   Not only will this bring a shit ton new fans to the CLG org but they're not nearly as expensive as the lol or male cs go team in terms of both acquisition and maintenance which means that because of their dominance they can easily pay off whatever hotshot spent to acquire.  So all in all maybe hotshot is becoming a  wiser owner :D
CLG,3dk72u,xPAWNSTAR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:21:48 2015 UTC,Except nobody watches female CS other than miss Harvey's stream viewers. So CLG is bringing more support to female cs than cs is bringing to CLG. Also having a practice partner is smash helps heaps. That's the reason it's ALWAYS done in sc.   Winning a major in smash is worth more to CLG and is way cheaper than some tier 7 CS team winning a tournament that everyone hated anyway.
