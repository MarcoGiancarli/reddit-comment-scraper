I can't go out of my base without the stress of the one hit kills that have been finding me recently. It makes it rather hard to get anywhere and feel accomplished."
playrust,3e1kxa,LiarsEverywhere,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:14 2015 UTC,Lack of PvP is also an issue. There's no game between finishing making a base and finding a C4 BP.  If blueprints were changed so that players unlocked things via some pvp related incident that'd be good. Airdrops are really good and it's fun fighting over the airdrop. There's just nothing to do when there isn't an airdrop near you and seeing as they're random you can be logged in for hours and not have one fall remotely near you.
playrust,3e1kxa,Sachsmachine,2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:10 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be an interesting dynamic( although it'd be wayyyyy to big of a change) if C4 and rockets only dropped from Airdrops. Not craftable.  Make them a little bit more common (i.e. a stack of 5-10 C4 and rockets in an airdrop).  In addition to the airdrops, which would always be a flashpoint of violence, they would need some other methods of providing C4/rockets (they would need to be random/luck finds for small groups).  Anyways, this game is in trouble.   It's hard for me to play it recently because of how grindy it has gotten. There's no reason to run to an airdrop. There's no reason to raid unless it's for action as it's nearly impossible just to break even unless you find a really crap base that hasn't already been raided. When I log on to Rust now it's essentially guaranteed that I'm just going to be a lumberjack for the evening ;p"
playrust,3e1kxa,MrRogersOfRust,3,Tue Jul 21 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"It's not all about the PvE, though it is a factor. Early Rust game was better generally: the blueprint system, how you could raid small bases without C4 etc. You had something to do.  Now, I start. I create a 3x1 rock base with an armored codelocked door. I run around the map placing sleeping bags on radtowns and farm blueprints if I don't have them (boooring). I equip myself and run around the map trying to find people, which leads to 10 second gunfights that I either win or lose. (10 seconds because I don't kill on sight)  With hemp all around I don't even have to craft a bow..."
playrust,3e1kxa,Lambotino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"I find the playability for all early access games ebbs and flows.  There are stages in the development of both Rust and Dayz (only early access games I own at the moment) where I don't find the game engaging or entertaining because they are ironing out some kinks.  I have plenty of other games in my library though and I always keep track of the development of my early access games and when an update comes along that may make things enjoyable again I give it a try. Then all of a sudden the game is fun for a couple hundred more hours.    Long story short if you are having difficulty enjoying yourself playing Rust then it's time for a break.  Keep an eye on the devblogs, community updates and of course this subreddit and come back when you feel interested again."

Although not very possible but maybe if they got close.  I feel like the PvP threat and the PvE threat should be blurred almost indistinguishable at times if possible.  I remember recently I wasn't paying attention and I was ambushed by a bear.  It was actually scary for once, it was on me in a flash and I barely got a bolt shot off in time at point blank.  I barely had time to bandage before I Was attacked by a tribal looking spear wielding mad man and killed him. As soon as I started collecting  the bear gun shots, bullets whizzing by, two figures in the distance aiming at me.  I ran, I didn't have many options, so I dove into a river and let it take me down stream a bit before I Crossed and hid in some rocks.   I was bleeding, freezing, and scared.  I found a little hidey hole and built a fire and waited out the cold night hoping no one saw the light.  For that split second it felt very real, very survival like, I was along in a desolate frozen tundra and everything was trying to kill me.   Surviving by the skin of my teeth.  Hazardous weather and viscous wild life.  That what we need more, we need predators attracted to the smell of blood, making PvP battles very torrid chaotic affairs."

playrust,3e1kxa,nossr50,4,Tue Jul 21 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"This has been said numerous times and I agree. I'd like some sort of PvE threat. Even if it's akin to what Fel Reavers were in Burning Crusade. Giant obnoxious dudes that you know are coming and can choose to fight. I suppose you would have to code in areas where you did not allow building and only used the area as a ""pve"" area. Big concrete walls and you had to ladder up to the top and back down to go in and lay waste for a chance at some decent blueprints."
playrust,3e1kxa,fubarecognition,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind it being a bit more ""RPG"" like even though I know a lot of players don't want stats and levels and all that. At the very least I'd love to see some rare mobs that drop rare guns (or I guess eventually rare parts since garry said he wants modular weapons) or armor OR skins.   Also the world might need to be a bit more lively, add some wolf packs, some bear cubs, fawns, etc.   As far as what bigger threats might be.. Maybe this island is a Cabin in the Woods type situation.

I think that will have a impact on how the game is developing. it has been focusing on the pvp for long now and i think they will have to make a change in priority before people is leaving for good, we've already seen a substantial decrease in rust players since ark came out and that's not only cuz ark is ahead in the development, i think it's cuz it has a wider shape in how players can arrange the way they're playing..  in rust, a solo player or a casual player has nothing to do apart from being a tempting living target for bored nolifers.. in ark the nolifers and clan members are busy taming lvl100 animals, fighting other clans and even just keeping their dinos alive, and the game is more apealing for people who doesn't want to dedicate their life to a computer game.. and i'm sick of killing barrels...."

Rust is a harsh game and if you can't take that simply don't play it until you can get into a more stoic frame of mind.  Trying to turn Rust into another game is silly, if you like that other game go play it instead? Because Rust probably won't change dramatically to your tastes any time soon.

playrust,3e0bhp,k-volare,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:28 2015 UTC,"It's showing the total resistances provided by the items. Heat and Radiation have always checked all of your clothing at all times. I'm not sure if bullets and melee work the same regarding clothing. I doubt the Metal chest gives bullet resist at all since it functions differently to the clothing. Armor does only protect what it covers, so aside from the ""minus cold resist"" the chestplate might not provide any resistances.  If I had to guess: Picks, spears, and bows will be stab. Hatchets, knives, machetes, and swords will be slash. Hammers and clubs will be blunt.  Depending on how complex they make it, a Hatchet should be Slash and Blunt - but, best bet is that it'll only be one damage type."

playrust,3e33t0,Wyro12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:35 2015 UTC,True. But I always enjoyed inventory Tetris in DayZ/Diablo etc etc.
playrust,3e33t0,lindenkron,-7,Tue Jul 21 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"True. But they seem to be moving in that direction on a bunch of other things. Weather, food, water, cold, building stability and removing zombies."
playrust,3e33t0,Wyro12,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"However, I wouldn't be opposed to them decreasing inventory space a little bit and adding backpacks."
playrust,3e33t0,havocom,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:53 2015 UTC,They removed the zombies because they did not want to be seen as a copy of DayZ or H1Z1.
playrust,3e33t0,MeesterMan00,8,Tue Jul 21 17:21:32 2015 UTC,Didn't they remove the zombies well before H1Z1?
playrust,3e33t0,RobHeron5FDP,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:27 2015 UTC,Yes.
playrust,3e33t0,havocom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:29 2015 UTC,Very much so.
playrust,3e33t0,The_Shwassassin,0,Tue Jul 21 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but they removed them to not be a clone of games like DayZ (hence me mentioning H1Z1)."
playrust,3e33t0,SgtGrumbles89,9,Tue Jul 21 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think they'll have to wait until there's vehicles (or something similar) so players could carry their stacks of materials effectively. No one wants to pick up  5 wood, run back to their base and then pick up 5 more wood. That said, it seems a little weird that one guy can carry around a house worth of stone. Granted,  what matters is what's fun, not what's realistic and Facepunch has to figure out the balance as the go.  It would make sense to make it so ladders  take up a lot of space in your inventory. That would nerf them to some extent and make people happy.  Same thing with rockets. No one is carrying around 20 rockets without the world's biggest buttonhole."
playrust,3e33t0,FluffyTid,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:19 2015 UTC,Or even make it in the future that you have to craft ladders at a table and then you can only hold it in your hands and not your inventory. That way you have to designate a carrier while the others guard you. It would balance it so you can still use ladders but you can't just spam craft them on site and easily get to a roof.
playrust,3e33t0,sillyfish1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:49 2015 UTC,That sounds fun :)
playrust,3e33t0,sillyfish1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:12 2015 UTC,I agree.
playrust,3e33t0,IMateyI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:58 2015 UTC,"We're not going to able to carry around ladders, research tables, spike walls, tool cabinets and what not, all that big stuff. We'll need to craft/build them right on the spot where we want them. Expect to see that in the future."
playrust,3e33t0,Rockso_Phd,4,Tue Jul 21 17:16:45 2015 UTC,Would be awesome to have backpacks and limit the weight you can carry.  Build carts and make them slow to pull or push so if you raid a place you have to bring the loot back in one or many carts.  Making you vulnerable on the way back. Could use the cart to gather resources too.
playrust,3e33t0,GordonNewman,6,Tue Jul 21 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think they should make it so you have specific inventory spots for weapons. I would say 2 for ""large weapons"" and a slot for a melee weapon or sidearm. All of which would be visible on the player dayz style."
playrust,3e33t0,isgrig712,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:01 2015 UTC,this is a sucky idea. Please explain how 6 guns total is THAT much worse than 3 guns... as it is most people use 3 for guns 3 for melee/health
playrust,3e33t0,the_WH4LE,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"It's more the fact that right now a naked could have 6 fully-loaded, large guns on his hotbar that don't show up on his person.  And as you say, most people only carry 3 guns on their bar currently so switching to 2 slots for primaries and 1 for sidearm/melee, or whatever the setup, wouldn't really change anything and it would be easier to have all of the weapons be visible on the person dayz style."
playrust,3e33t0,O_B_C_D,2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, clothes should have more of an impact with regard to inventory space. Also, perhaps with every item of clothing you get an extra slot in your toolbar? This toolbar would only allow 1 or 2 slots if naked, and would show what you have in your toolbar on your character in-game."
playrust,3e33t0,FluffyTid,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, a realistic carrying system would nerf the advantage of being naked."
playrust,3e33t0,ComradeDispenser,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:42 2015 UTC,advntage of being naked lol. Maybe if your enemies are 14 year olds and you have a female character :D
playrust,3e33t0,lindenkron,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:28 2015 UTC,I really think it should be a bit like Unturned.  Limited only to a toolbelt and armor until we get a backpack or something to hold our stuff.  Needing a backpack would also eliminate the issue of nakeds carrying as many guns as the Bullet Farmer from Mad Max.
playrust,3e33t0,GretSeat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I want this type of inventory system, I wouldn't hold my breath for it. It's a lot of work and Garrys opinion is   ""I don't think it's as fun as people think it is tbh"" - Garry J. Newman"
playrust,3e33t0,MeesterMan00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. Yes it would. Give us a backpack that can carry more, or give us the ability to have ""Weight"" so if we carry more, we are slower. Prevents people from actually going out and farming up 200000 wood, and running home.   WHICH prevents frustration for when you actually DO get killed you don't lose all of your wood.  WHICH makes making quarrys a priority.  WHICH makes defending them a priority.  Also means that inside that base will be more loot. Since they can't keep it on them.  I like it."
playrust,3e33t0,deelowe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:46 2015 UTC,I've been playing STALKER recently and the carry weight cap adds a whole new dimension to the game. But it won't be added because FP wants to cater to the Minecraft crowd now more than anything else.
playrust,3e33t0,FrankieVallie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:52 2015 UTC,I prefer encumberance.
playrust,3e33t0,GordonNewman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:27 2015 UTC,So that we can have the headache inducing hassle of an inventory management like in H1Z1? Thanks but no thanks
playrust,3e33t0,Undecided_Username_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"To be quite honest, out of a large number of choices, per item inventory is the most fun and least annoying. I can write up the reasons, but weight is just depressing (I hated dayz epoch for this) and a weapon limit is just stupid (3 hotspots in H1Z1? It's fucking stupid. I can't even carry binoculars without wasting a precious gun slot.)  It's fine as is. If anything, it just needs to be expanded a bit. Backpacks that are droppable and slow you, etc."
playrust,3e33t0,IncredibleMeh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:34:48 2015 UTC,I loved Diablo 2. But rust won't benefit from its inventory. Rust inventory is fine the way it is. It's balanced.
playrust,3e33t0,homeslicerae,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"I would enjoy a system where certain objects take up more than one slot on an inventory, things like Bolt Action and AKs taking up maybe two or three spaces. So well armed or well equipped player will not be capable of carrying as much equipment and resources on them, unless they have items to facilitate that purpose such as backpacks or bags."
playrust,3e33t0,Elementium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:45 2015 UTC,Sounds tedious to be honest
playrust,3e33t0,Angry_Gnome,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:48 2015 UTC,"I'm for limited guns but it would be a huge pain in the ass to limit resource carrying to a ""realistic"" amount.   Limited guns atleast makes for strategy when you're out raiding. Not just ""bring 10 AK's""."
playrust,3e33t0,MsuttonM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:53 2015 UTC,Yes I think that the inventory / backpack system needs to be worked on. It's frustrating that a naked can carry the exact same amount of equipment as a veteran player.
playrust,3e36wh,LosanWosan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:54 2015 UTC,I just look for barrels that aren't by a rad town or road and I generally find more caves closer to the water and in the arid and forest biomes.
playrust,3e36wh,mastiffdude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"Well, on servers that are running the livemap plugin playrust.io shows the location of all the caves on the map."
playrust,3e36wh,Poka105,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"I  wonder why playrust.io doesn't display the caves on some/all(?) servers... I do believe they are placed on map much like other monuments are, their location shouldn't be hard to pull from the code.  I think my strategy next time there's a map regeneration (I play on Texas) is to make a private server real quick with the same seed/size and noclip around as admin. Flying through the sky I should be able to sweep the map and locate the caves in a matter of minutes, then log in to the official server and have the edge over other players. Hop into official, run to all the caves real quick, settle one.  On the other hand, despite being nice to build in and fortify, cave bases quickly become huge targets. Usually within a few days of wipe, you can expect to see only the most powerful clans living in the caves. Any 1-3 man groups won't last long in them."
playrust,3e0upf,NeglectedWalrus,12,Tue Jul 21 02:22:21 2015 UTC,"In my opinion they just need to be thinner, like the Thompson or the Ak, for increased accuracy, dawg."
playrust,3e0upf,WonderMacaroni,7,Tue Jul 21 07:31:59 2015 UTC,"when are they adding that delay after firing a shot it doesn't reload instantly and zooms out makes it allot easier to see where you hit and then being able to correct your aim if it was off, they added it a couple of updates ago by mistake to the bone shank i think."
playrust,3e0upf,byvELTEN,3,Tue Jul 21 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"This has been bothering my since day 1 in Rust. Pointed it out several times myself, I guess it's because the bolt was one of the first weapons in game and at that time nobody really cared about this kind of stuff.  The recent patch made it a whole lot better, yet the bolt's accuracy and sniping abilities remain inferior to the AK's. In any kind of PvP situation the AK remains the best weapon in game - on any distance.  The bolt really needs a proper ironsight asap, period."
playrust,3e0upf,DerDuderich,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"It's almost like they want -everyone- to always use AKs. Poor Bolt Action Rifle. I really like it, it feels much more like what gunfights should be in that environment (not 4 guys with endless ammunition storming in with AKs)."

playrust,3e0upf,nossr50,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:51:08 2015 UTC,I play on Hapis and my server has a fix for the barrels... sometimes they spawn in pretty much impossible to reach places like super steep mountain slopes. I have a habit of sniping them so they respawn in better places :)
playrust,3e0upf,deicide666ra,3,Tue Jul 21 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"this is accurate right?, if so then it's perfect for a precision gun, it's x position is in the center of the middle iron sight and it's y position is at the tip of the two metal bars on the side. Perfect, it lets you calculate drop while still keeping your target in vision.  If anything it should be slightly higher, it's a little lower than the tip of the two metal bars."
playrust,3e0upf,RealDeepIsRealShallo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:36 2015 UTC,"It's not, It's Y position is not at the tip of the two. It's this weird floating point in the middle.   Before this update when the sweet spot was on the left tip, I knew exactly where it was, and man I could HS people when they were so far away you could barely tell them from a stick (BDC included) But since this update, it's just too broad an area in the middle.

We have done a lot of really good work in the past 24 hours to get this up to a playable state, but we are not advertising it on our server title yet. I'd love for people to come in and test it out and provide feedback. As of right now, NPC's do hit you, but do not do melee/firearms movement models. Hopefully I will have this in tomorrow, but after spending 22 hours working on this, I need sleep :P  Pathing is pretty good. Infact, its really good considering how horrible the games AI responds to correct pathing. The minor problems we see are AI not being able to use L and U shaped stairs (so they will fly up to you if you are above them). They work perfect on halfblock stairs, just minor issues if you go inside the church and up the tower. (Oddly, they can go down the L and U stairs perfectly fine, just not up. Maybe they are lazy and just want to fly)"

The devs get next to no revenue from this, and at the prices the current skins are at now, they get maybe a few pennies per transaction. That's IT, cause Valve takes the lions share. And those prices are only going to drop.  You're known for bitching and crying for anything that you disagree with, so you commenting is no surprise to me. If all you do is complain about how Rust is heading, why the actual fuck are you making everyone else pissed at you in this sub. Go away."
playrust,3dzy33,EyrionOfTime,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:03:53 2015 UTC,"You must be new to Rust   Lol with a video on Feburary 2014 I sure am new  They trashed their working version for a Rust 2.0 that would be 1:1 - except it's now not 1:1 in the slightest fucking way. And people wonder why some people prefer Legacy over the new Rust. They said they was porting the map, and at the last minute it was suddenly Hapis. Yeah great work fellas.  Better add the market to a early-access game when the base game hardly even operates correctly!   You're known for bitching and crying for anything that you disagree with   I use facts to back up my arguments, which gets people very upset. How can you defend shit gameplay with candle hats?  I love how you're trying to defend the market as well.. holy shit dude. The market is there to make more money from games. Like, that's it. There's no need for it in this game right now at all. I bet you'd agree with anything Facepunch does.  Edit: This quote here from 11 hours ago is perfect.   Why do people on this sub always have to defend the game no matter what and constantly make excuses?"
playrust,3dzy33,Sauxez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:07 2015 UTC,"Lol with a video on Feburary 2014 I sure am new   Lot of people coming from the early days of Legacy who have played no more than 2 hours previous even. They like the newer, polished Rust more.    hardly even operates correctly!   It operates at a much better quality than most early access games. Don't even try to argue that shit, Rust is really well optimized for the shear amount of data it takes. Yes it needs improvement, but It is a well-made game. Not AAA title standards, but certainly not ""hardly"" working.    I use facts to back up my arguments, which gets people very upset   No, you argue by being sardonic and condescending in every comment that you make, with a few facts thrown in so you think it's everyone else's fault for being pissed at you. ""Shit gameplay"" is your absolute and subject opinion, plenty of people are having a great time in Rust.   except it's now not 1:1 in the slightest fucking way   That was the original plan, yes, but are you really going to keep that chip on your shoulder when they have done factually a much better job both in optimizations and features in Rust 2.0? Seriously?   I'm not defending the market itself, I'm defending the devs. They do a lot of shit to be whined at for doing a feature that gains them even the barest amount of revenue, do you not see all the work they've done??? Did you even read what I said? They get a few pennies per transaction, give it a month and they'll be lucky to get even a single penny per transaction with more people selling the skins over time and driving the price down. Valve takes the lions' share.    constantly make excuses?   The difference there is I'm not making excuses. I like the game, I defend it. I understand it's their game, not mine. You signed on the Alpha train fully knowing that you can help change the course of the game, but it's not your game. They can develop it any which way they choose. Welcome to Alpha, if it doesn't suite your taste then walk away and come back when it's done."

Barely anyone did that, link me these ""lots of people""  Really well made with almost a year of being unable to jump properly, and almost all options having no impact on the game at all.  I do use facts buddy, probably why you are so mad at me lmao. The gameplay is shit and clunky in this game right now, anyone who disagrees is most likely a fanboy  Legacy Rust was fine gameplay-wise, nobody complained and I never said it was shit.  The work they've done? You mean lying constantly in devblogs, releasing things people don't want and changing the entire game for no apparent reason? Alright buddy.   when they have done factually a much better job both in optimizations and features in Rust 2.0?   LOL what planet are you on mate??

Also Bugs is in the know with the devs so  when these major issues come out like the dupe one he knew it was best to just wipe and start again instead of dealing with a week of bullshit.  Their Low Pop server is fun but the map is kinda small. I will keep playing on that until the next BP wipe because I don't want to do any more barrel farming for now. After the next BP wipe I'll move to the high pop server.

playrust,3dxvhh,jverducci,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd imagine it would be intensive. I think the big issue is that so much of the game is changing still.

playrust,3dxvhh,CorporalAris,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Haha good question. No, the server is doing lots of movement checks and firing checks. The issue here is you need to cover all the ground. The fixes so fsr for problems like this have been to restrict grabbing through walls or to restrict grabbing items though furnaces clipping through walls.   This is just another method that may checked, or blocked, or perhaps they just rewrite some code.   The intention was to have EAC do all cheat checking but Facepunch noted a few weeks ago that it wasn't enough, and they'd step up their own anti cheat as well in addition to EAC.   It's just a alpha game, you add checks as necessary, not the other way around."

playrust,3dxvhh,Panzerdamon,5,Mon Jul 20 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"All of the above. First of all, it's more programming, more modules, more testing.   Second, I mean, people just cry ""add a check!"" Uh, are we checking every second? Every server tick? Is it a simple math check, or are we performing Ray traces to determine what is allowed? An if then? Maybe we loop through various conditions?   If it's programmed poorly, If it's not tested, if it doesn't scale, these are all issues.   I for one am glad they are waiting before fixing. Minimal overhead will give us a fantastic game, when we get there. Honestly, they probably are working on fixes. It take several rejected modules before you find the sweet spot. Programming is an artful science."

playrust,3dxvhh,SmalleyBiggs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:10 2015 UTC,"Everyone, listen to this guy. I know a relevant tale about a game called Runescape. There was so much fear about cheaters and bots in it that the developers planned a day where they would break every bot that relied on injection/reflection by obfuscating every single game function.  Of course, it worked magnificently. Once the update was fully deployed, there wasn't a single bot to be found. But since they dumped so much code obfuscation and ""legitimacy checks"" into the client, nobody could get a framerate above 25FPS.  Once they caved to all the people who used to get 60FPS on high and now they were getting 20FPS on low, they starting relaxing the active anticheat to reclaim game performance. But the bots started appearing in droves again. Relying on the game alone to prevent cheaters is a losing proposition - ask any Counter-Strike player."
playrust,3dxvhh,Rossco1337,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"Because you can never have 100% coverage with server side checks. The closer you get to 100% coverage, the larger the load on the server. In a perfect world, the server would run an exact copy of the client and check everything. However, this means that the server would be running ~200 instances of rust at the same time. No normal server can handle this. You'd need a cluster for every server instance.  I'm just spitballing here, but I wonder if this hack works due to how much difference in space is allowed between the client's location and where the server thinks the client should be. So the client says ""im here"" when it requests to loot a person and the server allows it, if it's not too far outside of the expected location."

playrust,3dxvhh,DrakenZA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"And UO was 18 years ago. Back when we had less than 10 Million transistors on a Pentium. Now we have over a Billion transistors along with other tech in progress that makes each transistor all that more efficient.  We have the CPU power to check everything server side. More importantly, we have dedicated GPU modules that can run in VM hardware and provide GPU operations to server side code. Allowing phys-x calculations.   Developers tend to avoid spending time on this problem because it's a hard problem. Synchronizing between the client and the server in such a floating point world ends up with edge conditions and very small fractional amounts of difference. Getting your physics to work the same way each time while run in two different locations, is not easy. Most games up until now didn't even synchronize rag dolls. They were client side.   It's a problem that can and should be fixed. It dismays me that we've ignored it for the last`17 years."

You don't even have to shoot for 100% coverage. Aimbots will always be with us, as will wall hacks. That will never change. But letting someone super-jump, or fly hack, or loot mechanics that don't take into account Line Of Sight.... these are just rookie mistakes. Most games experience them, and most devs patch solutions in late in the dev cycle.  Those of us that have been playing these games, and more, since 1997/UO, have seen the gamut. Games that let you open a loot container anywhere you are on the map, if you just use a hack to do it. Or open a bank container anywhere on a map, if you use a hack. I've seen the bank container one on at least 3 MMO's.   Part of this, is just 'lazy' programming. I'm not saying the programmers are lazy, I'm saying they are trying to avoid all the edge cases, and mostly get something working. I'm in favor of that, as long as someone on the team is keeping a list of all the places they'll need to go back and harden.   Also, server power right now is incredibly cheap. Thanks to AWS, Azure and GCE, the big three are in a price war. If Facepunch wanted official servers to use utilize dedicated resources, they could make that happen. And with the modern cloud services, you pay for what you use, which fits like a glove in the game industry. No longer do you have to hire a team, and spend 2 million dollars building out data centers. Now you hire one guy, part time, that sets up the scripts necessary to scale as demand needs.   This absolutely should be the time in the game industry when server side checks, even the ""close enough checks"" are part of the default build in a game."
playrust,3dxvhh,ElMalakai,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Its not 'lazy programming', its conservative programming. You under estimate how much load adding a single check in the wrong place can be.  People are complaining about the exact same thing in H1Z1, the devs have been more open on that subreddit though.   Also the game is being designed to run on some sort of super cloud, people host Rust servers from their local ISPS and many other places that wouldnt have the power to run servers that would easily run on AWS etc.  Also i wouldnt use UO as the 'pinnacle of anticheat' or something, while it did some things great, there were many exploits and problems through its life, and we talking a non early access product."
playrust,3dxvhh,DrakenZA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:33 2015 UTC,"I find those sentiments to be a cop out. And let's not bring H1Z1/Sony/Whoever into this. They have consistently chosen to ignore server side cheat protection in almost every one of their games.   You don't need a 'super cloud' to run Rust with server side checks. And local ISPS are not running rust servers. These are primarily on game server hosting, which is just a host mesh over on top of traditional dedicated hosting. Although some have lately started to leverage the AWS/Azure realms for game hosting.   The load necessary to do something as simple as catching cheaters who choose to fly hack, jump hack, speed hack... etr can be very low. In fact, it need to be instant. Just record the player's position with a timestamp, and run a process against that data later, possibly via another machine.  We're talking 200 players, running on a 33 tick server, sending a Vector3 of their current position. We'll throw in a few extra bytes (8) to track the 'time' on the server. Let's ignore ways to compress this data, and just store it for later processing. We'll be getting 33 measurements a second, at 200 players, we'll max around .132MB/s of data that needs to get dumped to a disk.   That's a fraction of a fraction of current HDD or SDD speeds. And this doesn't even bring into account using memory to cache and then flush to disk. You could even send that data via a socket to another server and let it handle the checks.  So what can we do with a timestamp log of player positions? We can look for teleport hacks. That's an easy one. We'll need to know when the player respawns, so we don't interpret that as a TP hack,  but that's not to hard. We have the world seed, we can tell when they are 'inside' the world, and no-clipping through the hull of the world. This doesn't even have to occur on the game server. This can occur after hours, or even a 3rd party website. We can also look for unusual horizontal velocities. Sure people can build tall things and jump off them, and get going pretty fast. But it's hard to find a viable reason for someone to translate x/y past a certain speed. You would again need the map seed, so you can identify the areas with terrain normals that would end up being a 'sliding' rock, and on those areas we up the maximum based on some friction value and steep angles.   See.. it may seem like a daunting task, when your goal is no cheating. But if you break it up, and start with the low hanging fruit, you can actually solve some of the bigger hacks without causing tickrate to be halved....  And the developers shouldn't look at this as a chinese wall. Where they throw all the 'anti-hack' stuff over into some other module. Honestly, a lot of what the ""anti-hack"" code needs could be very valuable to a game designer. Knowing where everyone walked? Storing that in a SQLLite database? You now have the data to enable Tracking. Giving people the ability to perform some test and perhaps see the footprints of someone that walked by here.   And the more the server code knows about the world, and the objects on the terrain, the better the MOB AI can be. It's unfair the MOB AI is given such a stark view of the world, and this leads to all sorts of artifacts like horses running through things, or up things at incredible angles.   In the end, it could be a win win. You pay for security with new features."
playrust,3dxvhh,ElMalakai,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:15 2015 UTC,"Umm, ISPs do host Rust servers, im not talking about the 'official servers' im talking about community servers.  Recording a players position constantly with a timestamp is something that would be intensive, not just the checking of that data. Besides that fact that the database would soon become out of hand, that is a lot of data, recording where the player is constantly is a huge waste of server resources.  These sorts of things need to be elegant and smart, you cant simply just 'record all the players movements and check that later'.  You seem to think you know a lot more than the H1Z1 and Rust guys, and devs any game with decent amount of players. Maybe you should write some sort of amazing middleware for people to use if you believe its so easy to pull off.  Also not sure what server you playing on, but mine is 128 tick."
playrust,3dxvhh,DrakenZA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of Internet Hosting Services, not Internet Service Providers. Traditionally, the point of an ISP is to get someone onto the internet. This could be Telco, Cable, Wireless ...etc. The point of a Hosting Provider is to be an abstract layer between a data center with a good NAP point, and offering virtualized servers hosted on physical boxes at those data centers for sale. Now a days, most these places call themselves private cloud providers.  Places like GameServers.com has leased out racks of boxes at multiple data centers around the country. That's who generally hosting the public rust servers.     Recording a players position constantly with a timestamp is something that would be intensive, not just the checking of that data. Besides that fact that the database would soon become out of hand, that is a lot of data, recording where the player is constantly is a huge waste of server resources.    It's not a lot of data. Even at 128 tick ( which clients do not send updates to the server at 128/s ). Our upper limit is like .5 MB/s, which is very manageable. And this isn't taking into account the fact that most the time, people aren't moving, and even if they are moving, 128 times a second, you don't delta very much.  Part of my frustration with discussions about anti-cheat/server side cheat protection, is the pundits are people who don't even really try to do the calculations. Maybe they don't know how to program, maybe they aren't familiar with what type of I/O they can expect in server hardware. But they generally piss all over the idea as ""too hard, too intensive"". It's like watching the TIG guys diss Notch on why block based games would never work (How would you pathfind, you'll run out of memory, it's impossible to render efficiently).  Each time a new game comes out, and the hacks follow, and we all talk in vent/ts/irc about ""what do you mean there's no LOS test, what do you mean people can noclip fly around the map and not be instantly banned"", we all seem to think, well, this game is fucked. This will show the industry. Next time they'll have to fix this first...  ...and then we all go and pre-alpha it.   The market should correct this, but most are happy to just ditch a fun game with no server side protection, and go to something new that's not being actively hacked yet...    These sorts of things need to be elegant and smart, you cant simply just 'record all the players movements and check that later'.    Why not? If CPU/IO resources are so tight, if the hull test are so expensive, then why not let server operators run a batch as they see fit, on their own dime/cpu time, to discover hackers and add to the banned list. I know plenty of operators that would go further than this, if it made their server even minutely more secure. Hell, most would up the box size or buy another box and run it interactively so people get banned instantly. In fact, I know people that would pay server operators for running servers that did extra server side checks. It's like the market can solve this if an option was there for it...    You seem to think you know a lot more than the H1Z1 and Rust guys, and devs any game with decent amount of players. Maybe you should write some sort of amazing middleware for people to use if you believe its so easy to pull off.    I don't write games for a living. I do something much more dull, but much more data intensive. I push the edge of C#, hardware systems, SQL and any number of middleware technologies. I get paid by banks to do this, so they pretty much can afford to make it happen. I'm always surprised when MMO back end code gets leaked. I'm amazed really when I read their code. I think there's a lot of brilliant game designers, 3d engine software engineers, and artists out there. I just don't think they are the best back end guys to work on problems like this."
playrust,3dxvhh,ElMalakai,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, ISPs still do host Rust servers, its mostly in countries that have terrible connections to all the large hosting services. In South Africa the ISPS(Internet Service Providers) host tons of game servers, the Gameservers.com for South Africa are hosted on the ISP know as MWEB. Not every server at gameservers.com is hosted in equally as good conditions, some are even third party, such as my example. Never assume you know everything.  There are already servers out there that run thier own 'anti-cheat' which easily could be doing what you want, the fact remains that it cant be part of the 'normal' server that comes with the game. The game is being designed so it doesnt have to be hosted at some massive hosting service, hence why the server is distributed and isnt closed off.  If you dont write games for a living, im going to say its a little hard for you to judge how hard it could be or how much it would effect the rest of the game. You normally have to trial and error on those kinds of things before finding out its not as easy as you think it up in your head."

It presumes you are fooling the other person.  This video author isn't fooling anyone, there is no illusion that he's a better player, he wants no credit.  He's flying around killing random people publicly and deleting their stuff purely in order to ruin their day, and because he can without anybody fighting back.  He's hoping they cry, they ragequit, they leave Rust, they beg.  He's wiping out many hours of work knowing that he's going to be demonized, because he wants to be.  Because that's fun for him.  This is just sheer sadism - not psychopathy, where you are trying to secure objectives regardless of other people, but sadistic schadenfreude, where you are taking pleasure in inflicting pain on a helpless target, in contravention of all social rules.  And not a helpless target that has wronged you, but a target of opportunity.  As a class, people who take delight in inflicting pain on helpless targets are people we can't tolerate in society, because it's impossible in practice to armor or protect every single human being against their depredations... and it's irritating as hell to endure the mess of attempts to try.  We don't like the TSA, don't like watching our kids every second of every day, don't like avoiding dark alleys, we don't like being afraid all the time, and it's not effective anyway.  The rest of us would sleep much more soundly if these people were, in fact, killed or imprisoned rather than permitted to do damage quietly.  We try and detect these people with crude stereotyped litmus tests like 'Did they torture the family pet as a kid?', and get them into some kind of treatment, because given freedoms the rest of us enjoy, they will harm others an inordinate amount before they are caught.  What these people are doing is on that level: Destroying other people's accomplishments who are helpless to fight back, in order to hear their cries of anguish.  It's just a game, but the family cat is just a cat.  The problem is the sort of person the hacker is demonstrating himself to be.  Rust provides plenty of safe opportunity to work out who you are, and maybe we expect what you see in that mirror to scare the shit out of you.  Read ""I hope you get AIDS and die"" or ""Kill yourself"" as a genuine ""I pray to God for protection against these people before they can cause more pain than they're capable of in a mere game."""

They need to make rockets so expensive that people won't make them unless they really want to fuck up a base.

They should be for taking out people in a base while others c4 it.

I made a lengthy post about something very similar to this, here is the Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/3dhkas/fix_for_game_breaking_join_server_freeze_and/  And here is the youtube video showing how to fix it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXTjaKyAqVQ  The video is a compilation of all the fixes I have found. The main fix that has helped several people has been opening Rust in Administrator mode. And others have said that Directx9 has fixed it.  Hope this helps :-D"

playrust,3dz4wk,TroubledPCNoob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:47 2015 UTC,Honestly what I do. Is I try not to play the game over an hour or so. If you play it over your computer gets softlocked. Atleast for me. It sounds silly. But after restarting you can just quickly load into the server again and keep restarting rust every hour so your computer doesn't get de_stroyed.

My problem is I'm having a lot of fun in rust again despite this bug so I put up with it and hope it'll be fixed every update."
playrust,3dz4wk,deelowe,0,Mon Jul 20 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"Try killing EAC along with rust and/or steam. Someone suggested this might fix the issue, but I haven't had a chance to explore it yet. It makes sense as EAC likely does a lot to prevent users from opening exploits and such.  It's probably not fixed yet b/c we don't know the root cause. It seems fairly sporadic (1-2 users complaining every so often)."

playrust,3e22si,Daankrab,3,Tue Jul 21 10:39:30 2015 UTC,Me being honest here. I am/was an admin on our server. Not your server!...anyway We switched providers and when we did I asked our primary owner not to make me a admin just now. The reason? I would be playing on my regular non admin character. I would run out of wood or ROCKETS instead of crafting more or going out to cut trees I would alt tab to RUSTY and just give myself more. My base was done in 3 days up to armor. I was bored. Not to mention I DID have a huge advantage. If I wanted to raid. (I am a solo raider) I would just RUSTY my self 50 or so C4 and go on walkabout. Not this time.. way to tempting to abuse that shit. I may have him grant me TP and fly powers to my admin character but I definitely DO NOT WANT access to the items. That shit was like free crack.  ADMINS DO NOT PLAY AMONG THE PEOPLE My Wife who also admins (SHE ONLY ADMINS) builds the admin base INSIDE the BALL. She doesn't spawn anything unballancing into the world. She doesn't play among the people unless it is some kind of wipe event.  Just move to a new server. You start over every month anyway.
playrust,3e22si,engraverwilliam01,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:55 2015 UTC,"I guess you don't talk about official community servers?  But yes. This is very much common practice that the guy/s paying for the server sit on the longer side of the handle. They will wipe/ban/spawn whatever/whenever they want and there is nothing really you can do about it apart from leaving the server, hoping that everyone else who's in their right mind will do the same.   I am talking out of experience (was playing with a group of 8 and we raided everybody. Next day the server was wiped and our former base-location was, who would have thought, used by admins, sure enough fortified to armored within 30 minutes of the wipe)"
playrust,3e22si,1sm3t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"It happens, you can't report them as it's their server.. they pay for it..   Simply don't play on that server and find a decent server with decent admins. We willl actually start our own server upcoming Thursday with community events etc. We will spawn stuff in for the events but we play legit. We have a group of 4 admins who all play for real and we grind just as much wood and stone as the next one :)  One bad experience doesn't make all servers bad of course."
playrust,3e22si,Deurmat1,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:20 2015 UTC,Yep thats common that they act high and mighty since they're paying for the server.
playrust,3e22si,7skidoo,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:08 2015 UTC,"I have an issue with that. Admins should not do support and play. Scenario: Someone calls for admin help because his base stability is weird. You remove the foundation that acts weird. Now you know the location of his base + his layout which gives you an advantage while raiding. Also, as a player I can only trust you that you don't use godmode while fighting. Maybe you got lucky or my aim was bad, sure - but I cannot be sure about it. If you don't do support at all it makes having admins obsolete, in my opinion. I'm not saying it cannot work, I'm just saying prepare for a shitstorm and mad players on your server."
playrust,3e22si,GiveMeTheRush,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:44 2015 UTC,"We know how you feel but you need to understand it's theirs, paid from their own pocket.  Some people do have servers who take things seriously and have created a great community, you just have to find them through trial and error."
playrust,3e22si,7skidoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"I do understand that people want something for their spend money. I play on modded server where the admin team doesn't interfere in gameplay. They don't got a base and they are not playing. I had admin rights the past days and tried to play but the rival clan didn't liked it, so I stopped playing. Why should they trust me that I won't spawn a few dozen rockets/C4 for the next raid? I think they did actually trust me, but they still felt uncomfortable about it. I asked to get demoted yesterday and now I'm a regular player again, having fun. Judging from that experience: players should NOT be admins and admins should keep it lowkey and don't participate in gameplay. That's just my thaughts and everyone is welcome to have a different oppinion, if a server works with admins playing along: that's cool!"
playrust,3e22si,Deurmat1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"I understand your feelings on this and I sorta agree, the owner of our server is actually not playing however we as admin/moderators are playing. After all we buy a game for fun and not to make money ;)   I have not seen any players complaining but then again we also don't interfere with other people bases and have some mods to help out with the stuff you described (remove being one of them). In general players don't get refunds or any help. We just make sure the events run ok and people don't get racist and stuff ..   You can never be sure about anyone to be honest. Even if a player is not an admin he could have a friend duping shit (like right?)   But I agree with your point in general. My advice is to find a trustworthy server with 1-2 admins and test it out .."

playrust,3e22si,johnhale101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:10 2015 UTC,"If an admin spawns anything into the world (other than a hammer) it's abuse.... period.  I admin a community server, I have a my main account to play on, it has no admin rights. When I need to admin, I quit and log on as an admin account.   I never spawn anything in, either through Rusty, or from my character's equip screen. Everything is logged and the admins watch each other, so there is no abuse (one bad apple ruins the server).   If I help a player out (needing a wall removed/etc), I take note of his/her base location and it is off limits to me (I will not raid them).  It's not that hard to be a responsible and fair admin. But then, I am a little older than the average rust player. The problem are the owner/admins who are younger and/or don't respect the other players or admins."
