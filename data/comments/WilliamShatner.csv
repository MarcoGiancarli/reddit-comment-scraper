WilliamShatner,334jj2,stox,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"At one point in my conversation with Kevin Sirotek, he stopped referring to the ""Star Trek"" actor as William Shatner and began calling him Bill.  Despite the leader of the Starship Enterprise's stratospheric popularity, he's a ""down to earth guy,"" insists Sirotek, ""with a great sense of humor.""  Captain Kirk also happens to be his business partner. NBCUniversal Summer Press Day - Panels  William Shatner has a hand in a new motorcycle being developed. (Kevork Djansezian, Getty Images)  Together Shatner and Sirotek's Aurora-based custom motorcycle company, American Wrench, designed and created a new type of futuristic-looking bike that will roar out of its Fox Valley home this summer for a week-long promotional trek across the country, with Captain Kirk in the driver's seat, of course.  While there's not yet been a price tag put on the Rivet One that's still in production, Sirotek is already taking orders since word got out a couple months ago about the three-wheeled bike: a 2,500-pound, 500 horse-power machine Popular Mechanics described as a ""motorcycle dragster."" lRelated Annual Record Store Day raises awareness of independent retailer  Lake County Lifestyles and Entertainment     Annual Record Store Day raises awareness of independent retailer  See all related 8  And it all began in an autograph line. Seriously.  The actor was in Downers Grove in the spring of 2013 promoting the franchise's ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" when American Wrench Director of Innovation Dylan Moller not only requested the actor's signature, he asked if the movie star would be interested in helping create a new kind of motorcycle.  Sirotek understands the power of branding. That's why American Wrench has aligned with rock stars like the band Creed to design custom bikes given away for charity during tours, and supplied motorcycle frames for the Orange County Choppers' TV show. Summer schedule announced for RiverEdge Park in Aurora Summer schedule announced for RiverEdge Park in Aurora  He also understands innovation and hard work.  In fact, Sirotek is every bit as excited to talk about this family-owned business that goes back to his great-grandfather Joseph, a trained engineer who arrived in New York City from Czechoslovakia with little more than the clothes on his back and an immigrant's desire to snag that American dream.  Immediately the elder Sirotek saw the potential in automobiles. And after moving to Chicago, he started Illinois Auto Electric, which eventually expanded into trains, then trucks. Today, according to its website, IAE is ""one of America's largest independent sales and service facilities of transportation and industrial equipment... and outdoor care products.""  It's also still very much-family oriented. And when he and his brother became entrenched in the business back in the mid-1990s, they formed American Wrench to specialize in one of their passions – motorcycles.  They also knew Shatner shared that same love. That's why the question from Moller ""held up that autograph line for 20 minutes,"" noted Sirotek. But the conversation eventually led to a sit down with Shatner and his wife Elizabeth in their Kentucky home.  ""That's when he asked us to call him Bill,"" Sirotek told me. And that relationship only grew stronger as Rivet went from an idea in an iconic star's mind to a prototype now being hand-created in a Plainfield building that is part of American Wrench.  ""Iron Bill"" not only insisted on ""a design that breaks the mold,"" noted Sirotek, he wanted three wheels for stability, a windshield and canopy (detachable) for inclement weather; and another rider's seat for company.  ""It's been a fun partnership,"" insisted Sirotek, which is evident in a video about the give and take between partners on the americanwrench.org web.  Sirotek is not sure at this point whether the official kickoff of Shatner's cross-country run will begin here or in downtown Chicago. As the Rivet – its design was inspired by a B-17 bomber -- comes together, he's also been in discussion with the American Legion Riders for this coming-out tour to serve as a fundraiser for the group's legacy fund to help families of fallen troops.  But one things is for certain: Sirotek says he and brother Brian will join their good friend Bill on that adventure.  ""What better work excuse,"" he said, ""than to take a seven-day ride.""

Against the backdrop of all these others who love him, you have a spread of bit players from 40 years ago who trash him.  People who were not even on the set every day.  Who you gonna believe?

WilliamShatner,2znq2l,TotesMessenger,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"Hi Mr Shatner!  I think everyone understands that things have been pretty overwhelming so far this year and I'm sure we are all very sorry for your loss.  That you would stop by at all is really awesome of you and I look forward to hearing back from you at some point.  And btw, that scene in Loaded Weapon where you stick your head in the aquarium and pull a fish out by your teeth still makes me laugh to even think about.  Also, I grew up in the 80s/90s but you are the quintessential captain of the Enterprise.  Also also, I loved your hosting of SNL in '86, I saw the Trekkie convention skit when I was an impressionable preteen and I think it helped keep me from becoming unhealthily invested in fictional worlds.  You're a great guy, sir, and we are privileged that you would spend time with us at all, so thank you.  Edit: clarity."

WilliamShatner,2xts4a,TheSuperSax,17,Tue Mar 3 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  The Jewish tradition means fast burials and there are many close relatives that miss funerals, that is why there is a 7 day period of mourning for people to come and pay their respects.  I'm glad he didn't push himself to fly across a continent after doing charity work all day.  He's 83 for goodness sake."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,X-ibid,9,Wed Mar 4 00:12:43 2015 UTC,Don't I know it. I had to miss my own grandfather's funeral because I couldn't make travel arrangements within the allotted time.  It's one of the reasons we sit Shiva.
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,elmcityslim,4,Wed Mar 4 00:28:32 2015 UTC,I think everyone criticizing him needs to read that last sentence you write.
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,ChoolyBuzkill,9,Wed Mar 4 02:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Mr. Nimoy would be pleased to know that he upheld his charity engagement.  Good on you, Mr. Shatner. It can't have been easy missing such a dear friend's funeral."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,Qender,7,Wed Mar 4 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"More importantly, this is his personal and private business, and strangers should not have any reason or need to approve or disapprove of his decisions or his schedule.  Besides, it's others have said, funerals are for the friends and family of the deceased. Some people want to attend, some people don't, it is everyone's personal decision about what's best for them. If you want to attend, and are unable to, is your own loss, and no one else's but yours.  The fact that other people are attacking him for being unable to attend a funeral is one of the most insensitive and inappropriate things I've ever seen."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,Xuttuh,2,Wed Mar 4 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"Either way someone was going to be annoyed. Either he missed the charity event and disappointed people, or missed his friend's service and disappointed people.  It was a Kobayashi Maru scenario.  In the end he made a difficult choice, and we should support him, in what is, a very difficult time."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,AnoK760,5,Sun Mar 8 06:13:20 2015 UTC,"It just shows how much character Mr. Shatner actually has. I can't imagine how he felt not being able to go to Nimoy's funeral.   I loved his response to the hate though...   Here I am, tell me off.   I'd gladly join his landing party. Even if I were a redshirt"
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,dauntlessmath,4,Tue Mar 3 22:51:37 2015 UTC,Bill is a class act. It's a shame how some so-called fans have been treating him during this difficult time. Maybe they just want someone to blame for the loss they feel.
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,mr_majorly,0,Wed Mar 4 03:28:23 2015 UTC,"Most of those whining are pure internet trolls who don't even follow Mr. Shatner. But hey, new controversy and they are all in. Mr. Shatner, I'm sure, has seen his fair share of stunts like this before.  Those of us that actually do follow him know better."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,dreamfall,1 point,Thu Mar 5 11:31:49 2015 UTC,"I support Mr. Shatner as well. I've had to miss a beloved friend's funeral for reasons outside my control, it already sucks enough without people being horrible about it.  I am appalled at the way people behaved over it."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,Conchobair,4,Wed Mar 4 00:46:17 2015 UTC,Funerals are very much more for the grieving than for those that have already passed on.  Bill should be more than allowed to do what he needs to in order to come to help terms with the passing of his friend.
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,elmcityslim,2,Tue Mar 3 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"I couldn't attend the funeral of my 23 year old cousin because I had exams. I couldn't attend my uncles funeral because I had to give a lecture. I was only able to attend my best friends wake and not his funeral because I had a poster session and a flight to catch for a conference.   It's terrible and heartbreaking when you can't say goodbye properly. But here is the thing, you're still alive and the world is moving on and it can give two shits when it comes to your grief. So you have to pick up the pieces and carry on with your life. It sounds callous, but my uncle, cousin, best friend, and Spock are all dead - your life and responsibilities are not. I'm sure Bill helped a lot of people by doing service at this charity event and Nimoy would understand."
WilliamShatner,2xts4a,thesuperevilclown,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"i definitely support the decision. absolutely.  another thing that really wouldn't surprise me is if there was also a private gathering of Mr. Nimoy's friends. the big funeral was for everyone, but there are still people who knew him much better than that, including Mr. Shatner, and i feel they deserve the chance to say goodbye privately, in their own way, where their hands are not forced by public scrutiny, and their grief isn't turned into a marketing ploy."
WilliamShatner,2xmjuh,DukeGoogamuke,6,Mon Mar 2 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"this is hilarious. he didn't ""lose it"" but was instead just trolling. the rest of the people in the studio get the joke. including the producer. you can hear them all laughing. even the producer."

WilliamShatner,2xmjuh,DanV_Rev9,5,Mon Mar 2 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"hey idiot, Shatner was a class act through that and had fun with the guy because the producer was such a fool ... you don't correct talent, you direct talent ... this producer actually did line-readings for a legend (you don't do a line-reading for your talent, almost never) ... Shatner was quite a good sport about it and had fun with the situation, feeding the guy more and more rope"
WilliamShatner,2xkh4s,GenVG,15,Sun Mar 1 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to celebrate Mr. Nimoy's life, other than to reflect on his work. I was born in '74, so I was too young to see Star Trek during its initial run, although I watched it a bit on reruns with my uncle in the early '80s. I was a ""movies era"" kid. But that only served to make me want to watch the original series even more. And of course I have them on Blu-Ray now, but that's beside the point.   My other memory of him at a young age was him being on In Search Of. I loved that show. I remember being young enough to not quite get why Spock was here and talking about crystal skulls, but I was enthused none the less. And yeah, I totally flipped out seeing him in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I was like ""Woah, I know that guy!!!""  As an avid History Channel/Discovery/Science Channel watcher, I immediatley recognized his voice narrating. And that made me smile. He's up there with Keith David and James Earl Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch on my list of people I'd most like to read me the Bible. Or the phone book.   Like most, I never met Mr. Nimoy, but he certainly was with me my whole life in one fashion or another. I read the other day he said he found himself talking to himself as Spock and was able to find logical answers to some of the situations he was facing. I honestly have done that too. It's actually not a bad idea.   I'm glad Mr. Nimoy was able, even if at times he wrestled with it, to be a profound influence on so many people. So much so he was able to walk away from Hollywood and explore things like photography. Not everyone gets to be an icon and still be who they want to be. That's a good life. I hope his friends and family find solace in that. And if there is an afterlife, I hope he can join up with Mr. Kelley, Mr. Doohan, Ms. Barrett , and Mr. Roddenberry and laugh at us dorks who take Star Trek way too seriously.   Goodbye, Leonard. I wish I met you. It would have been fun."

WilliamShatner,2tc786,Captain-fach,16,Thu Jan 22 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Give me if this is the 50,000 time this is been asked here   But that's the thing. Imagine if that was all you were asked about day in and day out all day long for years. And years. And decades. And decades. I think if anyone was entitled to actually get away with hating Star Trek, it would be him (not that I'm saying he does, but I wouldn't blame him one bit).  However, Bill makes the effort to continue engaging with fans at the conventions and signing autographs at the shows. I remember way back during shows like the 25th anniversary convention, and back then you had virtually no chance at getting his autograph in person. Now just preordering an autograph ticket guarantees you a signature. You don't see Harrison Ford agreeing to meet with fans to sign anything they want to put in front of him from Star Wars.   I honestly wouldn't care if Bill hated Star Trek. I doubt he does. But he still acts respectably towards it, and that's what counts. You could love your favorite meal but having it thrust constantly in your face everyday (especially when out in public) would make you want something else. And believe me, it would be exceptionally rare for anyone to pose a Star Trek question that he hasn't heard before at least once, and likely dozens or hundreds of times over.   Respect the man, enjoy his work, but let him have his peace from hearing about the same subject over and over again ad nauseum.  Personally, if it were up to me, I'd rather see Bill do more comedy. He has a great sense of comedic timing and will hopefully return to a regular comedy series again soon.    but does he like any of the other star trek?   Honestly, how is he ever supposed to answer that? Journalism is dead, and any comment he makes will either be used as an endorsement or scathing attack by some blogger trying to get web clicks. Anything he said, no matter how innocent, will surely be misconstrued and twisted.  Sorry, but the question has too many shades of grey, and is too easily twisted by others seeking to gain attention from what Bill says. It's best to just let it be and enjoy what he chooses to share. He really has been incredibly giving with his Trek association and willingness to participate and continue talking about it. I'm content to just let him continue on his own terms, not the fans."

WilliamShatner,2tc786,studdenfadden,1 point,Thu Jan 22 23:53:59 2015 UTC,That was funny!  I've always liked his sense of humor.
WilliamShatner,2tc786,paisleyterror,4,Fri Jan 23 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"his views re; Star Trek have grown and changed over time - he's resigned to it now and has some wistful feelings of nostalgia for it and is plainly baffled hour it became such a cultural phenomenon   he's articulated his views on it from the beginning and all along his career  he sees himself as a serious, properly trained theater actor who made the transition to television and film - it's about booking work and committing to the part  he, as a person, also has a titanic ego and sense of machismo about himself  these aren't opinions, these are observations over decades  don't forget he knows well the millions come from Star Trek and it is a gig that just keeps on paying ... he would not have had the cultural icon status that attracted Priceline to hire him without Star Trek (which made him his hundreds of millions) ... he wouldn't be ghost-written scifi author without Star Trek  It wasn't until his late 50s when he finally embraced his icon status and started to get the joke and laugh at himself and have fun with caricatures of himself that he seemed to really book more serious work again  his ego keeps him wanting to be the center of attention regarding anything Star Trek but he doesn't love the material for its own sake ... Shatner would have been happiest if he could have been the next Gary Cooper and westerns paid him all those millions  he's a workaholic and likes to feel relevant and in-the-mix, hence his constant participation in cons (which he used to loathe), media cameos and talk and reality shows ... but as much as he likes to feel like he's hip to what the kids are up to these days his periodic rants and snits about twitter, reddit, etc. show that he doesn't get the snarky/for-a-laugh/trolly nature of much of modern media  all that said, still love the guy for doing Kirk and in more recent years for Crane and the many spoofs he's done (Se7en was especially good)"
WilliamShatner,2tc786,radii314,2,Fri Jan 23 19:08:52 2015 UTC,I hear a rumor of him showing up in Star Trek 3.  What do you think
WilliamShatner,2tc786,radii314,2,Fri Jan 23 19:11:28 2015 UTC,that's part of what lost Orci the writing job - Shatner made demands that he not just do cameo stuff like Nimoy but be central to the story and have lots of screen time ... there was no way Orci or the studio were going to do that ... doubtful Bill will see the reality and accept a minor role or cameo (I'd stick him in there as evil Kirk from the Mirror Universe wearing black with a goatee)
WilliamShatner,2tc786,Bitaemo,2,Fri Jan 23 19:13:56 2015 UTC,Haha.  He's a little self centered I've noticed.  He's a little old to be the center of attention in a young mans movie
WilliamShatner,2tc786,antidense,6,Sat Jan 24 04:20:52 2015 UTC,"I can tell you as one of the mods, he is not able to comment on startrek. I don't know why. I assume contractural agreements still in place with studios."
WilliamShatner,2tc786,ElDuderino2112,2,Thu Jan 22 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"I think his documentary ""How Shatner Changed the World"" goes into his current views/feelings about Star Trek. You can probably find it on youtube or something."
WilliamShatner,2tc786,Conchobair,2,Fri Jan 23 04:58:03 2015 UTC,"Bill still regularly does appearances and signings for Star Trek, so regardless of his feeling on the series he's still great to the fans. Hell he did a Two Captains panel with Patrick Stewart in Toronto last year that was great."
WilliamShatner,2tc786,StarFuryG7,2,Fri Jan 23 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's a complicated thing.  I think he respects Star Trek, but he doesn't want it eclipse who he is.  He appreciates what it's done for him and the love of the fans, but at times the obsession and attention to this one role can be overwhelming.  It's a double edged sword."
WilliamShatner,2tc786,ademnus,2,Fri Jan 23 17:21:24 2015 UTC,That's what I would think
WilliamShatner,2tc786,NemWan,2,Fri Jan 23 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"Watch the documentaries and interviews he's done on the subject because that's where he opens up about it. I'm thinking ""Mind Meld"", "" The Captains"", and probably the last one he did for EPIX a couple of years ago, although I forget what that one was called off hand.  I think he has an affection for ""Star Trek"" --his ""Star Trek"", and I think he appreciates the fans even if he has found some (or perhaps even many of them) odd at times. However, it's important to remember that his experience is far different for him than it is for us as fans, since for him it's a job, it's work, and yes, of course it's a paycheck, but for us as fans --we flat-out enjoy it and pay to see it, and pay to buy the episodes and movies on DVD and Blu-ray. We kick back, put our feet up, and just enjoy ourselves. For Bill, it's always been about work. That doesn't mean he doesn't like it, but it's a very different perspective on the whole thing compared to ours."
WilliamShatner,2tc786,robinsky1,1 point,Sat Jan 31 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"We all do our jobs for the money. As an actor myself, I can safely say there are some roles / shows you just fall in love with and the rest are a paycheck -and it's not some kind of attack on the people who love those to not love it yourself. That said, I suspect we may never hear from him on the subject but since he still wants to do the next Trek film, I bet he probably enjoys it. He has said in interviews that he hasn't watched the other series and frankly I don't blame him. There's many shows I have done, and some I loved doing, that I don't want to watch now. It's not the same when you're in it. You can't get into the story, you keep thinking about the cast and crew you worked with, what happened that day of shooting, etc. If I watch, it's to bring back memories of a job I loved but I can't be pulled in as an audience member, if that makes sense."

Ben Folds, Aimee Mann, Henry Rollins, Brad Paisley, and Joe Jackson. It was the perfect kind of high concept yet still catchy album. And for me, Shatner's cover of Common People will always be the greatest."
WilliamShatner,2pt8ue,gonzoblair,3,Sat Dec 20 01:04:34 2014 UTC,"""Common People"" and ""You'll Have Time"" are worth the cost of the album all on their own."

These people most likely didn't keep in touch.  And that's fine.  It's been 10 years since I have graduated and there are people who I have not kept up with from highschool (who I spent 4 years interacting with) that I have no idea what their names are.   This kind of stuff is normal."

All those weeks of shooting where you're actually giving direction and you forget a main castmembers name?

I also forget people's names all the time; if I haven't talked to someone in a few weeks will totally purge their names from my memory. It's terrible, but I can't help it.

According to George, Shat would cut lines and eliminate wide shots to focus on him. Of course, Shat claims he was only trying to make the show better, more dynamic, and did these things with no malice. He claims to be completely unaware, for years, of the animosity coming from George and the other costars.  IIRC, Shat apologized in his book for anything he may have done inadvertently, but George seems to be holding on to the grudge. It seem to be more on George to drop it, but he keeps talking about it.  The media doesn't help either. Both of them get asked about it, but George is always ready to negative, it seems to me.

Although he really didn't do any announcing, he would come in for a week, every now and then. It's the place where his personality and great sense of humor shine through. He's a favorite of the show's fans.  He's such a sweet and endearing person, it seems odd to me that he can't put the past with William behind him. That's a long time to hold a grudge."

Chris Pine isn't bad, its just a 21st century take on the character. I like to think of the James Bond films as a comparison. Sean Connery was an awesome Bond, but so is Daniel Craig. They are just in different eras and each actor is phenomenal in their own era. Just my two cents on the subject."
WilliamShatner,2hcfg7,outtokill7,2,Thu Sep 25 02:14:38 2014 UTC,"This is why I qualified it with ""in my heart"".  Plenty of people like Chris Pine as Kirk.  The new movies garnered new fans.  Some have no idea William Shatner played the part previously.  Personally I think Chris Pine is a fine actor and plays this alternate universe Kirk rather well.  But Bill will always be my prime Kirk.  And alternate Kirk will never feel truly like my Kirk.  But that's just me.    And to your point about Bond, I think technically Bond is supposed to be the same person the entire time.  But I've always thought of it along the same lines as M or Q, where the existing version retires or dies and is replaced by a new person.  As if James Bond 007 was the title of top agent of MI6.  Not that I disagree.  It's a good comparison.  Just thought I'd throw that out there."

WilliamShatner,2hcfg7,robinsky1,1 point,Wed Sep 24 21:31:31 2014 UTC,"I think this is a really bad idea - Bill had his day as Capt. Kirk and he was exceptional as Kirk, it has to be said.  I can't see why Bill got such a bad rap about his acting - he wasn't that bad. I can think of much worse.   However, the original cast should be allowed to maintain their dignity now. Not always a good idea to revisit old haunts - doesn't always come off.   The original cast should remain in the past now and forever be a part of nostalgia. Will always be grateful for the good memories of the cast and their exploits, as well."

WilliamShatner,2h6e5u,Ginger-Nerd,1 point,Tue Sep 23 08:06:13 2014 UTC,They could and I do foresee a return to tv one day soonish but I think they will experiment with Netflix etc a bit first.  But I'm sure as far as movies go there will be many more than 3. I think the deciding factor is how well this new director can pick it up.

WilliamShatner,2h6e5u,eagerbeaver1414,2,Tue Sep 23 01:12:28 2014 UTC,I have learned that the script for Star Trek 3 includes a scene that reteams Shatner and Nimoy onscreen as Kirk and Spock for the first time in canon since 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.   Yes. Please let this happen! Seeing Shatner and Nimoy together again as Kirk & Spock is the perfect way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Star Trek.

WilliamShatner,2eeynj,TrekfromAu,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:00:19 2014 UTC,thank you again for everything you do it is all so awesome; but how do you find the time?
WilliamShatner,2eeynj,Baloodancer,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:02:36 2014 UTC,Just wanna say I enjoyed your recent blog post on your Gishwhes experience.  Keep 'em coming!

I still have my original (very, very worn) paperback of TekWar from when it first came out. Those books don't always get the love they should from people, and everyone should check them out."
WilliamShatner,2eeynj,EnderWg,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:04:35 2014 UTC,Screw it. Next year I'm gonna try out for Gishwhes Team Shatner.
WilliamShatner,2eeynj,kalebxavier,1 point,Sun Aug 24 03:07:19 2014 UTC,"I'm not Mr. Shatner, but here's the best I can offer - love yourself first.  As part of that explore your interests. Make a point out of turning to a stranger during pursuit of those interests and say hello.  Perhaps you might make a friend.    Something I learned during the GISHWHES Seattle meetup - I stood there for an hour+ holding hands with complete strangers, and learned a lot about the people standing with me.  I got a few phone numbers, too, and have exchanged some texts since then.  Be brave.  Risk vs reward, right?"

WilliamShatner,2dig2o,sorif,2,Thu Aug 14 05:26:25 2014 UTC,Slow night! So lemme get a discussion going: do u plan on blogging about your Gishwhes experience?  Would be interested to hear about it.
WilliamShatner,2dig2o,deltopia,8,Thu Aug 14 05:26:59 2014 UTC,"I have been thinking about it.  I will definitely blog about the NASA/Mars Rock task at some point since some other group is pretending that I ""helped them"" get it or something silly like that.  It is the one item that I will not yield on.  My team got it, period: end of discussion with NO help.    If some person knew someone at NASA who informed them that my task was underway; that's really underhanded, IMHO.    Unfortunately NASA tweeted it out several hours too early and of all people Tweeted it directly to Cupcake.  Per the rules, if someone other than your team releases it; it's still fair."
WilliamShatner,2dig2o,Itswonderful,1 point,Thu Aug 14 05:41:18 2014 UTC,Well I would definitely be interested to read about all of that so I hope you do blog about it. Gishwhes sounds like it was intense but fun. Perhaps if you do it next year I will apply to be on Team Shatner.
WilliamShatner,2dig2o,Lightspeedius,2,Thu Aug 14 05:46:51 2014 UTC,It is amazing to me how you keep up with the latest trends and technologies. I can only hope to do the same when I'll be your age!  Have a nice day!

He'll normally just make a post asking how everyone is, and that's it.   You might also want to try tweeting at him. He's more active there."

WilliamShatner,29zjv4,redditamusebouche,2,Wed Jul 9 21:13:14 2014 UTC,"Château d'Yquem:       Château d'Yquem (French: [ʃɑto d ikɛm]) is a Premier Cru Supérieur (Fr: ""Superior First Growth"") wine from the Sauternes, Gironde region in the southern part of the Bordeaux vineyards known as Graves. In the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, Château d'Yquem was the only Sauternes given this rating, indicating its perceived superiority and higher prices over all other wines of its type. Yquem's success stems largely from the site's susceptibility to attack by ""noble rot"" (Botrytis cinerea).

WilliamShatner,2979s8,highvoltage988,2,Fri Jun 27 01:15:34 2014 UTC,"Hi Bill,  Great chance for me to say a renewed thanks to you for your portrayal of Captain Kirk. I'm in the late episodes of season two of an Original Series rewatch, and boy I am loving it -- it's been quite a while since I watched the whole series consecutively. Such a delight. I know at various times you've answered every question about it that I could throw out there, so I'll leave my questions to two:   Since you and Leonard have always remained so close, how is he doing? I've heard a minimal amount, but was glad to hear he'll have a video appearance at the big event in London. Is he keeping in good spirits?  Second, I notice you've been really re-engaged (pardon the expression) with Trek in the last few years, and have the big London event this year, the Next Gen reunion in Illinois as well, and of course your work on The Captains docs. I and many other fans are loving that, but do you think Denny Crane will ever return for a one-off appearance of any kind? I really miss the heck outta that guy.  Edit: just popped back in to say oh yeah, this is on the front page right now. ;)"

I wish there was a way to get it remastered, or at least to get a better quality version of it. Considering it was '96 it was probably shot on film then mastered on dbeta.

William Shatner does these great facial expressions and I don't know it's just different, I mean with the camera shots and pauses and the looks- all of that combined together equals a dramedy that was new and  hasn't been mimicked after the show ended. And it deals with real issues too in a strong way. And then there's the Mad Cow story line, which is unbelievably sad."

I was wondering if I could ask you a huge favor. I am going to ask my my girlfriend's parents permission to ask her to marry me and they are both obsessed with The Original Series. They have a dog named Tribble and a pet snake named Tiberius. If there is any way that I could possibly get some sort of video of recommendation, or even a voice recording, it would be amazing. Either for asking her parents' permission, or the proposal itself. I really love her and just want to do something special for her. And also to be honest their family is much wealthier than mine and it is a little intimidating. She said she didn't need her family's approval, but I know it would mean a lot to her for them to support us.  Sincerely,  /u/xeba"

I was wondering if I could ask you a huge favor. I am going to ask my my girlfriend's parents permission to ask her to marry me and they are both obsessed with The Original Series. They have a dog named Tribble and a pet snake named Tiberius. If there is any way that I could possibly get some sort of video of recommendation, or even a voice recording, it would be amazing. Either for asking her parents' permission, or the proposal itself. I really love her and just want to do something special for her. And also to be honest their family is much wealthier than mine and it is a little intimidating. She said she didn't need her family's approval, but I know it would mean a lot to her for them to support us.  Sincerely,  /u/xeba"

WilliamShatner,25n0xx,Mansyn,8,Thu May 15 17:09:23 2014 UTC,There's many roles an actor wishes he would have gotten in hindsight. I don't think there is a role I went for but did not get that in hindsight I thought I could do better.

Did you ever have anybody on the show where, after the interview, you thought ""I don't like this person as much as I used to."" No names, of course. Just curious, because sometimes that happens to me after watching the interviews. Some people are better left a mystery."

I was wondering if I could ask you a huge favor. I am going to ask my my girlfriend's parents permission to ask her to marry me and they are both obsessed with The Original Series. They have a dog named Tribble and a pet snake named Tiberius. If there is any way that I could possibly get some sort of video of recommendation, or even a voice recording, it would be amazing. Either for asking her parents' permission, or the proposal itself. I really love her and just want to do something special for her. And also to be honest their family is much wealthier than mine and it is a little intimidating. She said she didn't need her family's approval, but I know it would mean a lot to her for them to support us.  Sincerely,  /u/xeba"

WilliamShatner,25n0xx,veryhairyberry,0,Thu May 15 18:07:43 2014 UTC,"Well, to be fair, the hissy fit he had was after haters had been hounding him non-stop harassing him and even going after his fans and harassing whoever interacted with him on twitter, so I kind of understand why the guy ended up snapping and leaving the social media. People sometimes snap when under constant attacks and insults.  I know you would have handled such a situation much better, Bill. But you have so many more years of experience, while Orci is very young, so it's hard to compare."

There are more shows on right now that have some sort of fantasy element (not enough space shows to be sure, but Sci-Fi in a more general way). Movies like Gravity and the Marvel movies, shows like Cosmos and real-world events like the Curiosity landing have brought Sci-Fi and Sci-Reality to a level I don't think we've seen in my lifetime, in terms of ""popular legitimacy"".

In my opinion, Kirk was a major, influential character. However, William and the other actors in the show/movies have done other things and not just in front of the camera, which has brought them equal success. Yes, William will always be remembered as Captain Kirk, but as William says, he's done other things, too, for which he did equally well and got recognition for."

There's a default layout for posting links, content and starting discussions, but really, it's free webspace to do with as you please, within the guidelines. For instance, a subreddit can be completely closed to submissions, have no sidebar, and be used solely for it's wiki pages."
WilliamShatner,23jyhp,deadfraggle,2,Mon Apr 21 15:55:15 2014 UTC,"Reddit is sort of an all around source for news, discussion, and hobbies of whatever you are into.  If you like a particular tv-show, the city you live in, or what ever interests you, it facilitates these likings all into one.  For instance, I am a big fan of gardening, and the people at /r/gardening are pretty neat.   However, there are plenty of jerks on a large, free-of-charge website like this. So be weary."

WilliamShatner,23bzgp,Unshackledai,3,Fri Apr 18 04:37:47 2014 UTC,"Not Mr. Shatner, but I own a horse and ride. Personally I can't relate to ever being intimidated by them, although I have had to overcome my fears after a bad fall or something of the like.   Really though, for a long time after you start riding (provided you've found a good stable), the horses you'll be riding wouldn't so much as hurt a fly. They are really gentle creatures, and good school horses are something special (trust me, dealing with newbies is no fun for them) and can save your ass if you mess up. I have seen school horses dive under riders to keep them on when they start to lose balance, and slow down when their rider lost control, even when the riders were squeezing their legs to try to hold on, a move that would normally mean speed up. These guys aren't going to do anything bad to you. By the time you get to the kind of horse you're probably a bit intimidated by, you'll know how to handle yourself and your horse well enough to take it in stride.  If you want to get into horses, I would recommend going to a local stable that looks reputable and telling them as much. If you are unsure about which stable is right for you, your local tack shop should be able to point you in the right direction. The latter might be the best way to go; explain that you're new to horses and are a bit intimidated by them. The tack shops know which stable is good and which not so good. You may also find some reviews on the internet. If you find anything sketchy, don't go to that stable, not all stables are created equal and some are best off being avoided.  If you want to just be around them first, volunteer at a local therapeutic riding center or rescue center, it's a great way to be around them without actually riding. You can also watch some different horse sports like dressage or cutting or things like that, they may pique your interest and show you how amazing these creatures are. You can even go to a horse show if there's one near you!  Hope that helps, let me know if you want to know about anything else :p"

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,timeywimeydream,3,Mon Apr 7 02:38:50 2014 UTC,Your sense of humor was readily evident in your interviews and on your talk show of awhile back.  What took you away from us this past month?
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,wertin701,4,Mon Apr 7 02:42:16 2014 UTC,"All kinds of things, shooting, conventions, horse shows..."
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,wertin701,6,Mon Apr 7 02:43:28 2014 UTC,The Shat! That sounded bad...What is one thing you wish you could go back and redo?
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,wertin701,9,Mon Apr 7 02:43:24 2014 UTC,Ignore the Clock People?
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,wertin701,4,Mon Apr 7 02:46:45 2014 UTC,I thought it was hilarious when one of the Anti-Misha on twitter folks tried to tell you that you didn't understand the fandom.
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,wertin701,10,Mon Apr 7 02:40:21 2014 UTC,A lot of his fans are young and they think that an old guy like me doesn't understand their crazy obsessive behavior.
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Loganius,5,Mon Apr 7 02:44:19 2014 UTC,"Oh, if they only KNEW.  You could probably write a book.  Wait a minute, I think you did... ;)"
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Loganius,5,Mon Apr 7 02:59:00 2014 UTC,"How long has it been since you and Leonard saw each other? Just curious, because I know you two are best buddies for life."

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,ttys0,10,Mon Apr 7 02:38:06 2014 UTC,Anything written by me.  ;-)

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,heykim,4,Mon Apr 7 02:52:40 2014 UTC,Hello!
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,heykim,3,Mon Apr 7 02:54:23 2014 UTC,"When you said goodbye to us all on Twitter  My heart did thump and briefly flitter  That you might leave us all for good  and ne'er return to our Reddit-hood.    I'm happy to see you and as proud as a pheasant  To offer this poem as welcome home present.  And if from our midsts you again choose to flee  Just remember we'll come after thee.    With pitchforks.    Really, don't go.     Love, Ademnus ;)"
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,heykim,2,Mon Apr 7 04:50:34 2014 UTC,Would you ever consider coming back to Canada to work on new Canadian film or TV projects?
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,heykim,5,Mon Apr 7 02:40:10 2014 UTC,Solely Canadian projects for the Canadian market or projects filmed in Canada.  A lot of US productions are filmed there.
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,skii-2,2,Mon Apr 7 02:45:48 2014 UTC,"The former. What are  some of the Canadian initiatives you would like to be part of?   I have noticed that some Canadian programs really ARE distinct. There was a show with two brothers who each picked an item from curbside trash (old bed frame, or oven, whatever) them re-purpose them. They were civil, creative, fraternal.   Another example, the reality elimination competition show we produced, looking for the 'biggest genius' in Canada. The cooperation, wit, and general tone was so positive I was proud to be Canadian when I watched, especially the final. The 'competitive jerks' eliminated themselves early, and the best man won!   Can't we have more programming like that?"
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,pressuretobear,2,Mon Apr 7 15:28:23 2014 UTC,Will you tell my buddy Jeremiah to book his pool seat for Vegas. It would be a big help.

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Pondersaurusrex,2,Mon Apr 7 04:24:00 2014 UTC,How many spots do you have left on the GISHWHES team? And are you in it to win it?! Because the competition is fierce.
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Pondersaurusrex,3,Mon Apr 7 03:00:34 2014 UTC,A couple but we have a lot of applications.

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Master_Kr,3,Mon Apr 7 02:38:14 2014 UTC,I've been just great thanks!
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,oncdoc,1 point,Mon Apr 7 02:41:52 2014 UTC,I love watching all the CW actors get excited that you're watching their shows. It's kind of heart warming or something.
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,aubergdesigns,3,Mon Apr 7 02:38:36 2014 UTC,I love interacting with most of the CW actors.  They are in SciFi shows so it's a good cross section with those that follow me.

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,blechinger,1 point,Mon Apr 7 02:46:25 2014 UTC,You were awesome in your appearance on Rookie Blue.  I love that you're still supporting Canadian projects.  Anything I should watch out for in the future?
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Another-Chance,1 point,Mon Apr 7 02:47:32 2014 UTC,"Greetings Bill!  I saw your tweet directing us to reddit, and I wanted to guide you as to how best to have people find you on this fine site.   If you want people to come to your subreddit, use reddit.com/r/Williamshatner (the r = subreddit). If you want to refer to your username, use reddit.com/u/williamshatner (the u = user).   Bonus tip: If you link to a username who happens to have reddit gold, they will get a notification orangered!"
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,kellstar,1 point,Mon Apr 7 02:49:01 2014 UTC,"Bill, even though your nickname ""The Shat"" sounds like it is in the past tense, it is firmly ensconced in the present. May it be ever so."

WilliamShatner,22e6qw,briannhinton,1 point,Mon Apr 7 02:56:04 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately not, only an iphone to hand and it was like a tiny star moving at a constant speed (quite fast) across the sky. My best guess is that it was some sort of plane very very high up but it seemed way to fast to be a plane...I want to believe..."
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,briannhinton,4,Mon Apr 7 03:17:11 2014 UTC,It's very likely you saw the ISS (International Space Station). You can check on their website if it was visible at that time in your location :)
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Another-Chance,1 point,Mon Apr 7 04:39:29 2014 UTC,"Wow that is so cool, I'll be checking this regularly too see if it matches what I saw on sunday. While it is saying it was visible for about 1 min at my location last night. Whatever I saw was a few hours after the stated time the ISS was visible and it lasted about 5min rather than 1 min. Maybe my friend and I have really good eyesight :D."
WilliamShatner,22e6qw,Another-Chance,3,Mon Apr 7 12:24:39 2014 UTC,Probably was.

WilliamShatner,22e92t,SweetLittleMe,1 point,Tue Apr 8 09:32:15 2014 UTC,"For a better viewing experience, download the add-on Reddit Enhancement Suite for your browser. It's perfectly safe and millions of us use it.  Then, decide what you want to experience on Reddit, be it things you like, or things you want to know more about. All Subbredits start with www.reddit.com/r/...  /r/startrek   /r/williamshatner  /r/funny   /r/science   ..etc.  Sometimes, even after 2+ years here, I randomly type in something in to see if it exists.  There is also the option of attaining Reddit Gold, which makes for an ad-less viewing experience, even if the ads are tiny. It also allows you to view 100 posts at a time instead of 25 and many more little perks for the site.  If all else fails there is the Front Page which is a list of the highest posts in the default subreddits initially. You can subscribe to other subreddits (or unsubscribe from the defaults) to modify that list at any time. Once you do, the Front Page will only show content that you want to see, which makes it more personal when you login to the site.  There is also my personal favorite, All, which is the highest posts in each and every subbredit there is on the site.  It is an aggregate website that enjoys and promotes internet freedom, so... just be careful what you click on if you head to All. If you see something that is marked [NSFW], that means ""Not Safe For Work"".  Enjoy your time here!"

WilliamShatner,1z9oq5,yeadude,3,Sat Mar 1 16:20:38 2014 UTC,"Nah, there was no time to really chat to any of the headlining guests during the photo shoots. I doubt he even noticed the shirt. You just queue up, when it's your turn step over to the actor, the photographer snaps the pic and you're out of there. At this particular con the Shatner photo cost €50, all the other guest photo sessions were notably cheaper."

Your character on Boston Legal made me want to use my theatrical abilities to pursue law. I toured law schools, took the LSAT and interned at several law offices. Not once did I find anyone close to Denny so I decided to continue my first love and I couldn't be happier. I've been working pretty consistently. That was long winded. Sorry. I guess I could have just said that I loved Boston Legal."
WilliamShatner,1z8oj9,SensibleMadness,10,Sat Mar 1 05:23:28 2014 UTC,You aren't looking hard enough.  What you think is a comedy is actually very close to how things are.

I remember someone asking about his music and he said how great it was to work on the albums.  I still can't believe that - close to the end - I was able to squeeze in a question, too. My shoulder still hurts from keeping my arm in the air for what felt like centuries ;) I asked what he enjoyed most about interacting online on Twitter and Reddit. Mr. Shatner shared stories about getting in touch with and talking to other celebrities on Twitter and also said that he likes interacting with fans on social platforms."

These two days at the DST were so packed, I need a few days to sort things out and remember everything ;) ... but feel free to ask questions if you want to know anything specific.  Also, if you attended the DSTG, please share your pictures and experiences in this sub."
WilliamShatner,1yqhwq,ademnus,6,Sun Feb 23 21:51:12 2014 UTC,Does this mean Mr Shatner has finally watched The Next Generation?
WilliamShatner,1yqhwq,ademnus,3,Sun Feb 23 22:24:04 2014 UTC,It means that six actors talked about their work and their experiences inside and outside the Trek world. There were no in-universe questions that night which would have required anyone to have watched TNG.
WilliamShatner,1yqhwq,dagobahh,4,Sun Feb 23 22:51:03 2014 UTC,That's true. Nonetheless it is courteous to see the work of the actors you are there to moderate an event for. The work directly related to his own. They watched his work to prepare for their roles. I'd think by now he'd be willing to watch even a few episodes upon recommendation by the fans?
WilliamShatner,1yqhwq,ademnus,1 point,Sun Feb 23 22:56:14 2014 UTC,"When you think of all the cable specials he's done about Star Trek, the live events and what-have-you -- and how extremely popular and beloved Star Trek is with millions of people (not to mention how well the franchise has been to Mr. Shatner) it boggles my mind that he's never seen any of it.  Upon learning this I had to do some googling, and after reading his reasons for not watching any Star Trek, I was left thinking his excuses for not doing so were worse than lame.  Sorry Bill."
WilliamShatner,1yqhwq,inconspicuous_male,2,Mon Feb 24 17:14:36 2014 UTC,You hear that Bill?! And remember we love you -we just want you to see what we've seen. I think you'd actually like it!
WilliamShatner,1y5gi8,SweetLittleMe,1 point,Mon Feb 17 15:33:57 2014 UTC,"Harlan Ellison, whom we know is quite bitter about this episode still, made the comment about Joan Collins that, ""her mind is an arid desert, whereupon winds play.""   Probably the best cutting comment one can make but particularly mean, especially since he said it on television. I never felt that was fair to Joan, as she has always been such a wonderful part of television history.  Mr Shatner, have you ever had interaction with Harlan over this episode or the selection of Ms Collins as Edith?   My standing memory of him, despite having written some of my favorite sci fi, is me at 14 years old (a die hard TOS fan in the early 80s) walking into a panel discussion at my very first Trek convention to hear Harlan Ellison say, ""I think Gene Roddenberry is a F%$&@ asshole!""   I turned around and walked out.  Love Gene or hate him, you don't say that to young fans and not at an all TOS convention. I found him crude and inappropriate. I'm curious to hear your side of him, Mr Shatner."
WilliamShatner,1y5gi8,ademnus,1 point,Tue Feb 18 01:15:11 2014 UTC,"Ellison didn't like making compromises with his writing in terms of the television script. That's certainly a valid position from a writer's perspective of their work as art, but it doesn't address the reality of the situation. Ellison's script as it originally existed, went contrary to the nature of Captain Kirk and also featured elements that Roddenberry and others didn't consider ""Star Trek"" (such as the drug dealing, murderous crew member).  Script writing for TV is often about compromise and Ellison doesn't seem to have much interest in that. Still, he's a fantastic author and the episode that did get released is widely considered the best of TOS.  I also don't think Ellison would take issue with your noting him as being crude and inappropriate, he would probably agree."
WilliamShatner,1y5gi8,ademnus,1 point,Tue Feb 18 01:30:49 2014 UTC,"heh probably. Still, i don't think it's quite right to say such things about an actress publicly. It's not as though she shot his puppy, she just didn't match his idea of the character."
WilliamShatner,1y5gi8,ademnus,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:03:17 2014 UTC,"Oh, I agree completely. Although, I think Ellison considers what happened to the script to being at least as bad as if you shot his puppy. At least that's my takeaway from his years of rants on the subject."
WilliamShatner,1y5gi8,ademnus,1 point,Tue Feb 18 02:13:34 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's for sure.  Still, I'm certain he and Shatner has crossed paths at innumerable conventions and I'd like to hear his take on it all. Plus, I'm fairly certain he's fond of Joan Collins and wondered if he'd even ever seen said interview."

WilliamShatner,1x8kpc,trekkie4girl,4,Fri Feb 7 02:55:54 2014 UTC,It was a DELIGHTFUL show to watch simply to watch the two of you interact. It was hard to tell if you guys were really acting from a script or you were literally those characters and friends and it was a window in how you were together.  The relationship was sublime.    You've made many sublime moments on TV and Film and I'm thankful to have seen them.

The album was produced and arranged by Ben Folds and most of the songs are co-written by Folds and Shatner, with Folds creating arrangements for Shatner's prose-poems, and feature guest appearances from Joe Jackson (on a cover of Pulp's ""Common People""), Folds and Aimee Mann (backup vocals on ""That's Me Trying""), Lemon Jelly (on ""Together""), Henry Rollins and Adrian Belew (on ""I Can't Get Behind That""), and Brad Paisley (on ""Real"", which he wrote specifically for Shatner).  Henry Rollins also talks about the making of the song ""I Can't Get Behind That"" on his spoken-word album Talk Is Cheap Vol IV.

WilliamShatner,1swoii,La_Diabla,2,Sun Dec 15 02:53:11 2013 UTC,It's a funny story but they used a solution mainly composed of Buckley's mixture on TOS. If you watch closely it goes a long way to explaining some of the reactions of the cast.   Now back in the day Buckley's still contained alcohol. The production crew was supposed to dilute it. However due to some serious confusion in the metric conversion it was barely diluted at all. Those red faces aren't make up! It was some serious method acting.

WilliamShatner,1swoii,ElDuderino2112,22,Sun Dec 15 02:50:08 2013 UTC,Chekov.  That Crusher kid is too young to drink and then who wants to deal with a child vomiting because he can't hold his drink?
WilliamShatner,1swoii,choketheboys,9,Sun Dec 15 02:55:26 2013 UTC,"Crusher's also probably one of those sappy crying drunks, whereas Chekov seems like a fun, let's-go-get-in-trouble kind of drunk."

WilliamShatner,1re48n,miss-ann-thr0pe,6,Mon Nov 25 03:27:14 2013 UTC,It was groundbreaking whether or not their lips actually touched. I just wanna see those cross-eyed Shatner takes!
WilliamShatner,1re48n,SweetLittleMe,3,Mon Nov 25 03:40:08 2013 UTC,"It doesn't matter to me whether their lips touched or not. The idea is what counts - this and seeing Uhura as a member of the crew, which was indeed extraordinary at the time."
WilliamShatner,1re48n,ademnus,2,Mon Nov 25 20:06:17 2013 UTC,Beyond extraordinary. I am quite proud of them for their contributions to star trek and thereby society. Its just that this is not the first show to make the same claim and air sometime earlier.
WilliamShatner,1re48n,SweetLittleMe,2,Mon Nov 25 20:48:51 2013 UTC,"Oh, sorry. I must have ignored that part of the article.   So they obviously weren't the first then - no argument on that. However, both kisses are completely different in nature.   The kiss between Nancy Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. was so fleeting and seemingly unplanned (even though she said it was not) - it was like ""Whoops, sorry."" and people might overlook it.    The one on Star Trek was intentional and the audience must have been aware of that, too, since it is in the nature of a TV series to be scripted. This is no ""whoops"" moment, but deliberate action, planned weeks if not months ahead. It was also the first kiss with a somewhat sexual (although forced) motive.   However, BOTH required the courage not only of the people in front of the camera, but of everyone involved. This is truly admirable."

WilliamShatner,1r1ljo,paper_lover,6,Wed Nov 20 13:59:17 2013 UTC,"as is ""saught."" this inattention to detail doesn't bode well, IMHO. You'd think that Ilan Srulovicz would make sure things were correct in the ad considering how excited he must be to have made this watch!  ""The watch is dusted with 100% authentic asteroid dust. Egard saught out [an] authentic asteroid for this project to make sure that each watch has a piece of the universe right on the dial.""  Also, the entire watch is made of pieces of the universe!  On the other hand, if the manufacturer wants to emphasize the sort of Russian Soviet Pavel Chekovian feeling that the owner's name lends to the watch, then the typos and grammar problems become appropriate (""Egard sought out authentic asteroid ...""]"

That's an awesome interview. Shatner hears it and remarks that that's ""mean."" Then, he counters, rather artfully, by telling a story that paints Takei as basically a Star Trek convention fanboy—""But, I'm a captain.""  I think that's the only Stern interview I've ever seen with Shatner—and I only saw it that one time when it aired—but I have never forgotten his put-down. Moral: never take on Captain Kirk ;-)"

WilliamShatner,1pbsfh,davidsk,7,Sun Oct 27 18:36:13 2013 UTC,"The funny thing about the timing of this scene; the writers strike started on November 5, 2007; the same day that this scene was written?  It's just suspect and I never believed that this ever existed originally."
WilliamShatner,1pbsfh,williamshatner,1 point,Sun Nov 10 05:54:33 2013 UTC,"I'm sure you would know better than I, but could the date just be the date it was ""finalized"" and distributed to the relevant people? As in perhaps the actual writing aspect of it was completed the day before."
WilliamShatner,1pbsfh,Tipman79,8,Mon Nov 11 17:10:27 2013 UTC,"I would love to know the source of this, it seems very fan-written."
WilliamShatner,1pbsfh,crystalistwo,6,Sun Oct 27 19:37:08 2013 UTC,"Here it it: Star Trek 2009 on IMSDB (internet movie script database). I heard about the scene in a screenwriting interview of the writers, on Creative Screenwriting Magazine Podcast"
WilliamShatner,1pbsfh,cwenham,3,Sun Oct 27 19:43:19 2013 UTC,"It's in my copy of the script dated 11/5/07.

WilliamShatner,1p6t64,SweetLittleMe,1 point,Fri Oct 25 21:28:13 2013 UTC,I completely agree! English is such a wonderful language with such a rich vocabulary. It is very musical. There are great pieces of music in my mother tongue (German) too but French and English are among the most musical languages to me and even an instruction manual's sentence in French or English can already sound like the most exquisite line in a song. :)

WilliamShatner,1oq7y0,hwilhweaton,12,Fri Oct 18 17:54:03 2013 UTC,"I honestly don't have time to stop and accept gifts.  The issues with conventions are that I'm booked for X amount of time where I have to complete signings, photos and an onstage performance in those hours and the promoters usually sell as many autograph tickets and photograph tickets as they can for the time allotted.  So normally if someone gives me a gift I give it to whomever is assisting me to hold for me.  I am sure that it seems cold and unfeeling (I know it does because I've received some very nasty emails) but I'm there to do a job not to socialize.  I hope this answered the question."

WilliamShatner,1oi3bk,Itswonderful,2,Wed Oct 16 02:26:50 2013 UTC,That would be great. In Frankfurt there are even vineyards within the boundaries of the city (a little like in Vienna - but much smaller :D ) . They mainly cultivate Riesling. I even found a page in English about it: http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/frankfurt-wine-and-the-rheingau/?_r=0

The lyrics of ""So am I"" made me sad and scared me. I also remember the Al di Meola part well and the saxophone play. I enjoy W.S.'s voice so much. I have to listen to the album again when I can really concentrate. The pictures on and in the CD are special and good IMO.

WilliamShatner,1ndy15,williamshatner,18,Sun Sep 29 18:06:44 2013 UTC,Star Wars fans have been a bit traumatized lately (too many Vader helmets with mouse ears) and are thisclose to a meltdown if one more thing changes. Maybe the old-style logo is comforting?
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Glitterhidesallsins,12,Sun Sep 29 18:57:35 2013 UTC,Where can I get a Vader helmet with mouse ears? ;-)
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Glitterhidesallsins,2,Tue Oct 1 00:47:51 2013 UTC,eBay. I didn't know I needed that helmet until just now. Maybe you could get one for Carrie Fisher for a Christmas gift? She would REALLY appreciate it! (Talk about fanning the flames...)
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Xanthan81,1 point,Tue Oct 1 04:30:33 2013 UTC,They're selling them at Epcot.
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,confusicus,8,Fri Nov 1 02:27:27 2013 UTC,"I think Star Wars can get away with it to an extent, because they're all set around the same time - so it makes sense to stick with roughly the same logo.  Whereas Star Trek takes place in many different time periods, making a new and unique logo more of a priority."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Glitterhidesallsins,3,Sun Sep 29 19:39:07 2013 UTC,"How do you explain Voyager, TNG and DS9 font differences?  They are all within an even smaller timeframe than Star Wars multigenerational storyline?"
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,johnwayne1,6,Tue Oct 1 00:52:00 2013 UTC,"Star Trek fans embrace change and evolution, e.g. ""Where no man has gone before"" to ""Where no one has gone before.""  Star Wars fans don't even like the creator of the series changing anything, adding scenes and altering effects (I will admit he jacked it up, though).  Now don't anyone send me nasty messages, I grew up on both and love Kirk and Skywalker equally. But Star Wars is cooler, Star Trek is better."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,SweetLittleMe,1 point,Tue Oct 1 04:24:21 2013 UTC,Good point
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,ademnus,2,Sat Oct 5 04:19:59 2013 UTC,"I think the updates on the Trek logo also represent the different times/different shows and thus have been modified to fit a each show's character.  For SW however, I don't see a real time frame of the sort ST has and also don't think they should move away from the old logo. It's recognizable and unique.   BUT I also think that the word ""rebels"" doesn't go well with the rest in terms of style/type format and such. Actually, those round-ish characters somehow don't look like ""rebels"" at all."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,ademnus,4,Mon Sep 30 02:32:10 2013 UTC,"This brings up something I have just discussed with a friend recently.  When JJ reimagined star trek (btw they used the same font) he kept a retinue of Trek nerds on hand to tell him what was Star Trek and what wasn't -because he really didn't know. Some feel the values of Star Trek were missing in his reboot, others cite plot holes etc etc -In short, the protective fan base of Star Trek would always be at odds with him. But in general, they accepted him.  Well, he aint seen nothin' yet.  If you think Trek fans are protective of the IP, you'd be amazed at Star War fans. For god's sakes, JJ had never made Star trek before and fans could accept him. Star Wars fans unleashed unending hate on George Lucas for the prequels -and he invented the damn thing! He'd better learn his Star Wars on his own and not rely on the nerd squad because IMO he has much more at stake with the fans. He'd better be spot on and not solely rely on fan employees to tell him what's Star Wars -and if he had decided to change the logo, he wouldn't hear the end of it."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,ademnus,5,Sun Sep 29 22:32:58 2013 UTC,I think you overstate the number of Trek fans who accept JJ.
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,SamwellD,3,Mon Sep 30 02:23:00 2013 UTC,"nah, I think its a fairly even split. But seriously, the fans never tried to eat Gene alive -but Star Wars fans would've put Lucas on a spit over a roaring fire over Jar Jar..."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,ademnus,4,Mon Sep 30 02:29:35 2013 UTC,"Even split maybe, but Gene never screwed up Star trek like JJ did or Lucas with SW"
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,CervixRipper,4,Mon Sep 30 02:37:32 2013 UTC,Just wait'll ya see what he does to Star Wars.
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,stowy,2,Mon Sep 30 02:40:52 2013 UTC,"I disagree with this. Lucas did so horrible job with the new trilogy that I'm sure JJ can't do it any worse. I'm one of those people who doesn't accept his trek movies, but I'm sure he will do okay job with the Star Wars."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Kishara,1 point,Wed Oct 9 10:41:59 2013 UTC,"I dislike what Abrams has done to Star Trek. It's no longer ""Trek"" in its feeling. Sure they're good movies, I'm not criticising them in that respect, but they're not Star Trek. I think most people agree with that. On the other hand, I'm grateful for the way he re-invigorated interest in the series. I know people that got into the TV series' after watching the 2009 film.  I have those same fears with Star Wars. But it seems easier to do a Star Wars movie. From the get-go Star Wars was designed for the big screen as an action film. That was never the point of Star Trek. So I imagine it'll be easier to ""stay true"" to the IP and still make a compelling film. I don't know that Star Wars fans are any more rabid. George Lucas did a shitty job so he was heavily criticised. If Abrams does a shitty job he will also be dumped on. I don't think people will dismiss the new movies out of hand."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,enyri,1 point,Wed Oct 23 19:15:39 2013 UTC,"I agree with you essentially, but you know, there are still aspects to star wars that don't fit with JJ's style of film. Look at how Spock was once a character who told Kirk he would not kill and how now he chides Kirk for offering Nero a chance to surrender. How about Sarek telling Spock not to try to sublimate his emotional urge for revenge?   Now I think about the message of ""I knew there was more to you than money!"" Or the redemption of Vader by Luke? Would he devote an entire film to that notion?   In general, i think all of the action will be there, maybe even better, but the substance? I haven't seen precedent for it."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,ME_REDDITOR,2,Wed Oct 23 19:21:33 2013 UTC,I think they should stay with the old logo because it means an awful lot to most Star Wars fans. Which do you think they should go with?
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,dagobahh,4,Sun Sep 29 19:56:35 2013 UTC,I'm not suggesting that we change the name 'Star Wars' but just freshen up the typeface.
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,dagobahh,2,Tue Oct 1 00:49:09 2013 UTC,"I agree to a large extent.  While a fresh logo would have been cool, the old one is instantly recognizable and has meaning to a lot of people.  It would kinda be like changing the flag."
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,zodberg,1 point,Sun Sep 29 23:34:23 2013 UTC,Agree. Why poke at that hornets nest when it is not necessary?
WilliamShatner,1ndy15,Pop-up-king,1 point,Mon Sep 30 18:20:42 2013 UTC,"Honestly? As a fan of both franchises (for the most part), I have much more faith in The Powers at Star Trek being able to pull off changes without ending up feeling like they smeared shit all over your favorite teddy bear.   At this point, if they did a logo redesign, I wouldn't be a bit surprised to find it was just Star Wars written in un-kerned Comic Sans with a furry pink leopard print texture."

WilliamShatner,1ndx1m,Itswonderful,5,Sun Sep 29 17:58:21 2013 UTC,GWC?  It would depend on whether the institution is 501c3 and what percentage of the money raised actually went to research.

WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,Pawkeshup,15,Wed Aug 21 22:36:34 2013 UTC,Dread is such a harsh word and welcome just doesn't do it.... ;-)

But, to take my mind off of it, here is a question: Have you ever checked out the PBS Idea Channel on YouTube? I ask mainly because it's a ton of though-provoking stuff, seems up your alley."
WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,Robinisthemother,8,Wed Aug 21 22:05:33 2013 UTC,I will check it out.
WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,tribby,2,Wed Aug 21 22:07:46 2013 UTC,"Awesome. Just a disclaimer, I'm not at all involved with the channel, just stumbled on it as a happy accident. And the host's involvement with the audience reminds me of how you speak with your fans and relate to them.  Maybe that's one more reason you came to mind when I was watching it."

WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,clockwrksqrrel,7,Wed Aug 21 22:51:04 2013 UTC,It was a social statement for the times.

I liked it a lot. Also, should I watch The Animated Series before I watch the movies? Are they a part of Star Trek canon? I'm planning on watching them too but I can't wait to watch the movies because I know some extremely important events happen in them. (No spoilers please! I've managed to avoid them so far.)"

WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,TheDancingPenguin,3,Wed Aug 21 22:19:52 2013 UTC,Is this a trick question so you can stalk the places I mention?
WilliamShatner,1ku0d4,Heretictus,2,Wed Aug 21 22:24:59 2013 UTC,Of course not.  Just curious.  We have a bunch in our meetup group who are going to try to help break the world record for number of people in ST costumes on Sunday night.  Very excited about that.  Think you could join us?

WilliamShatner,1kte9u,SweetLittleMe,3,Wed Aug 21 18:14:16 2013 UTC,That was a session with several interviews. One of them was this which is undeniably hilarous. I'm in tears whenever I watch it. Wish is was better quality...

WilliamShatner,1kmi70,williamshatner,2,Thu Aug 29 06:11:28 2013 UTC,"Awww. Thanks so much for answering that, Bill! I also always loved the episode in which you used a knockout drug and VCR to set up your alibi. Leonard made a great villain, too, if you ever saw his episode with the low-quality stitches in his research partner. Just want to let you know as well that I'm a huge fan of your music! Your Has Been album and your tracks on Fear of Pop, especially In Love and your cover of Common People on your album are regulars in my playlist. Also, I'd love to see you as Alfred in the new Batman, please go for it!"
WilliamShatner,1kmi70,nutsocharles,2,Thu Aug 29 13:22:05 2013 UTC,oh wow didnt know he was in two. Knew about Nimoy he played a doctor villain where he killed the patient by defective stitches.

WilliamShatner,1kjyvn,mr_majorly,9,Sat Aug 17 16:03:37 2013 UTC,I wouldn't have known.  I would have had to ask.  I know it's across from Jimmy Kimmel's studio but that's as much as I know.
WilliamShatner,1kjyvn,williamshatner,5,Thu Aug 29 06:08:33 2013 UTC,"That was a chore to locate. I went full out CSI to find the exact position of it.   First, I found a general picture of it HERE Next, I found a broader shot of it HERE. The key there was the shadow (Lightpole or Tree), but after looking on google maps, those tiles in the upper left are only around trees. That narrowed it down so I focused on the Ruta Lee Star. After some digging, I located THIS which told me it was near the Chinese Theater and gave definition to the walls. Next I found that Ruta Lee had a website for all the stars she received, inducing that one near Mr.Shatner's... and it happened to include a full video. 2 key moments in the video really narrowed it down. At 8:15 the video zooms out to show more wall and at 8:32 it is shown to be right at the corner of the building. With all that info, it was near the tree and directly next to star at the corner of the building.   Can you tell I'm bored at work on a Saturday morning?"
WilliamShatner,1kjyvn,SweetLittleMe,3,Sat Aug 17 16:17:57 2013 UTC,"You could have asked me for it: Went there last year to worship ;) Those hands are my son's, the knees are mine. We had to shield it from the sun to get the picture, it's too shiny ;)  EDIT: Of course, had you asked me, you would have had nothing to fight the boredom... except of me ;)  ANOTHER EDIT: Let me know if you need Mr. Nimoy's star too, or Mr. Stewart's or ... well, we have a couple of them, but not all."
WilliamShatner,1kjyvn,Itswonderful,3,Sat Aug 17 23:31:09 2013 UTC,"Great detective work, Mr. Majorly :) I had never heard of R. Lee before. So, there are at least two stars from Montreal actors that are next to each other."

WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Rich6031-5,9,Sun Sep 8 15:15:12 2013 UTC,well I asked you yesterday if you like whisky at all and you just ignored me Bill.  sigh.
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,pleen,24,Fri Aug 16 01:38:21 2013 UTC,Still ignoring you...
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,lilpin13,5,Fri Aug 16 01:40:40 2013 UTC,"but there are some whiskies that are matured in ex-wine or ex-sherry barrels and I know you like Wine from your reviews. if that sounds interesting, and you get a chance, pic up some Aberlour a'bunadh."
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,jjustice,2,Fri Aug 16 01:43:37 2013 UTC,"Okay...but...you mentioned going to Kentucky.  There are many fine whiskies comming out of KY.  Maker's Mark, being my personal favorite.  But there is also a lovely winery in Ocoee TN if you prefer to stick to the formula.  It might be fun to talk to river guides about wine."

WilliamShatner,1kgk71,hafabes,8,Fri Aug 16 01:56:22 2013 UTC,You're welcome.  Why just audio books?  Buy the real thing and live a little!

WilliamShatner,1kgk71,WaiXingRen,4,Sun Sep 8 15:14:34 2013 UTC,Hey Mr. Shatner! I recently started watching the original series and consequently have fallen in love with you. I just thought I'd let you know.
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,WaiXingRen,3,Fri Aug 16 02:53:19 2013 UTC,LLAP Bill (greetings)  \\//_ How are you today?
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,WaiXingRen,6,Fri Aug 16 01:42:08 2013 UTC,I'm well!  And you?
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Dub124,4,Fri Aug 16 01:44:38 2013 UTC,"Honored, and I am well too.  Best day off ever, at least, for now."
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Dub124,8,Fri Aug 16 01:46:59 2013 UTC,Why would you take a Thursday off or are you in Australia?
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,messyhair42,3,Fri Aug 16 01:52:47 2013 UTC,"I can't work too much or I end up losing medic(are|aid) which are about the only thing I can afford for health care right now, but at ~$100 a month I'm making more money despite working less. The other, only, and next cheapest option is Empire, which wants $400 a month minimum. Much more than a part timer can earn. Yay New York.  I chose Thursdays because it's an oddly scheduled workday. My ever doting mother tries to feed me before that. It usually ends up rushed and I get a stomachache from eating too fast. I could take Saturday off, but who doesn't enjoy quiet mornings at work? It seems like the best option.  Today I mostly puttered around with my project's code, played some bombermine (an online multiplayer bomberman clone), and consulted reddit for inspiration.  What did you do today?"
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,inconspicuous_male,6,Fri Aug 16 02:17:44 2013 UTC,Ah...OK.  I'm getting ready for a horse show this weekend and then I'm off to the world championships in KY.

WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Azureheart,5,Fri Aug 16 02:09:27 2013 UTC,He might be my favorite character. I was curious if you see it as a form of flattery that he's loosely based on your characters or if it annoys you or gets you down.
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,beaverteeth92,10,Fri Aug 16 02:11:45 2013 UTC,He's based on me?  I'm not a tool...am I?
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,PlNG,7,Fri Aug 16 02:14:00 2013 UTC,"Hes based on the fact that Kirk makes out with every alien woman he meets. Zapp desperately tries to be like that.  Also, his velour uniforms are inspired by Star trek.  Granted he wears a skirt"
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,dinosaur_train,4,Fri Aug 16 02:48:30 2013 UTC,"You are way cooler than Zapp Brannigan. I love futurama, even it's trek parodies (when you did the voice for Where No Fan Has Gone Before : epic!) But Zapp is like all the ignorant pop cultural stereotypes about Kirk, like that he was a real womanizer and kind of an ass, when really, he was kind of a feminist, especially for the 60's! And you, Mr. Shatner - your No Means No passage in Up Till Now proves you really are in fact, the polar opposite of Zapp! Please come to reddit more, and yes, earlier, please, for East Coast folks :)"
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Leezabeth,3,Fri Aug 16 03:28:53 2013 UTC,I hope not.
WilliamShatner,1kgk71,Killwrathi,1 point,Fri Aug 16 02:29:09 2013 UTC,"Yes, he is a parody of you and Captain Kirk.   Brannigan is based on the Star Trek captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner; Brannigan and Shatner meet face-to-face in the episode ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"". The creators of the series envisioned Brannigan as similar to what Shatner himself would be like as a starship captain. Cohen describes him as being ""half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner"", and that the initial premise for the character was ""What if the real William Shatner was the captain of the Enterprise instead of Kirk?"". In the episode ""Amazon Women in the Mood"" the DVD audio commentary describes Zapp Brannigan's reinterpretation of ""Lola"" as a spoken word song is a reference to what William Shatner did with ""Rocket Man"". Brannigan also wears a girdle to appear thinner and in another episode nearly loses his toupee, seemingly a parody of similar accusations aimed at Shatner.   This is from Wikipedia, but the sources are available there."
