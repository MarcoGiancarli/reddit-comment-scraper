On average you'd probably pay $5 or so (except the most recent ones) per movie on US amazon, but even then it would run you up to like $400 with his ~70+ released films.  I myself have probably spent like $200 on less than optimal prices and I only have about 35 of his movies  The double-edged sword of our Lord's many works. A lot to enjoy but also costs quite a bit to have them all.    Looking it at it now you may very well be able to buy them used for the ridiculously low prices (some are even for $.01!) on Amazon but they would most likely be in terrible condition. Does not include shipping so it will likely   still be pretty expensive unless a seller has a lot of different ones available  But economically that is likely your only option; apart from going the pirate's way and putting it on a hard drive, which in this case might be an acceptable option considering what it's purpose would be."

onetruegod,3770uf,danarbok,5,Mon May 25 14:03:08 2015 UTC,Because it highlights the weakness in our nations security.  It's sometimes a painful truth to bare that we cannot actually protect our precious historical landmarks without our lord and saviour to rescue us.  It's a cautionary tale from Cage that we must learn to live without him sometimes in the hard times because he cannot always be there for us. For a lot of people this is a tough truth to deal with and it breeds negativity about the film  As you can see form 9/11 there are real world consequences to not following our lords advice and lessons at all times.  National Treasure is in fact his most somber work as it really is a mirror to how we should live our lives. Ever vigilant to the evils of Travolta and the perils of his ridiculous chin.  [REAL] because the trailers sucked balls and the film in itself was a bit too disneyfied to compete with the likes of 'The mummy' which was classic romp and pomp. Really silly terrorist stuff that made no sense. Needed a bit more logic and little more tongue in cheek. People needed to die in horrible ways to make it appeal to people above the ages of 5.

For instance, I would never consider you, my brothers and sisters, inferior to me just because I was baptized by Fast Times at Ridgemont High. We have all received our baptisms from different films, and with our individual baptisms came revelations all our own. Our Lord opens the eyes of each generation with different films, none more greater than the other and all equally holy.  Let me close my homily with the words of our Lord as he discloses the ageism and jealousy he experienced on the set of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, in the hopes that it will increase our empathy for one another and it can quell the division amongst you.   I was underage, so I couldn't get it because I couldn't work as many hours. And I was surrounded by actors, whose names I won't mention, who were not very open to the idea of a young guy named 'Coppola' being an actor. So that movie was instrumental in me changing my name because of the kind of unfortunate responses to my last name. They would congregate outside my trailer and say things, like quoting lines from Apocalypse Now, and it made it very hard for me to believe in myself.   May we emulate our Lords perseverance and strength, and not think to highly of ourselves. Amen."

onetruegod,369vxa,BrownBoognish,4,Sun May 17 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"Look closely, child of Cage - we all know quite well that there is no H in our Lord's name! Though the author of this piece is not our Lord, they do seem to be connected. I knew little of this work beforehand, but a quick bit of research reveals much.  See, that Eleni has made a great impact for peace, as Cage's influence brings peace to us and our world as well. Interestingly, the adaptation into film format stars none other than John Malkovich, who would go on to star in Con Air with our Lord Cage a mere 12 years later.   Do not take this as fact or gospel, for you must find your own way to Truth, but it does seem to me that it is Divine Purpose for a book containing the dissolution and pain of a family to connect to a film about bringing a family together despite impossible odds. Through His mortal messengers, Cage sends a message - that peace and the bonds of love can survive all. And foremost among these bonds, BrownBoognish, is Cage's trust in you, and your faith in Him.  May your Mountain Dew be sweet!"

There was also a vibration/humming noise that got progressively louder during the come up. I took one or two more hits, which made the effects even more intense before laying down in my bed. After that it was like flying through a worm hole for what seemed like a while, but what was really only five or ten minutes. I didn't smoke a lot, though.

I dreamt I was as light as the ether- a floating spirit visiting things to come. The shades and shadows of the people in my life rassled their way their way into my slumber. I dreamed that Gale and Evelle had decided to return to prison. Probably that's just as well. I don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell couple of guys, but maybe they weren't ready yet to come out into the world. And then I dreamed on, into the future, to a Christmas morn in the Arizona home where Nathan Junior was opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown. I saw Glen a few years later, still having no luck getting the cops to listen to his wild tales about me and Ed. Maybe he threw in one Polack joke too many. I don't know. And still I dreamed on, further into the future than I had ever dreamed before, watching Nathan Junior's progress from afar, taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own. Wondering if he ever thought of us and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little even if he couldn't remember just how they got broadened. But still I hadn't dreamt nothing about me and Ed until the end. And this was cloudier cause it was years, years away. But I saw an old couple being visited by their children, and all their grandchildren too. The old couple weren't screwed up. And neither were their kids or their grandkids. And I don't know. You tell me. This whole dream, was it wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to do? But me and Ed, we can be good too. And it seemed real. It seemed like us and it seemed like, well, our home. If not Arizona, then a land not too far away. Where all parents are strong and wise and capable and all children are happy and beloved. I don't know. Maybe it was Utah."

Then you need to rent a bunch of crap like a field and people and shit. I'm guessing people are expensive to rent, specially if you're forcing them to place a hundred n eighty thousand pictures on the ground.  The guy who's doing the kickstarter told me that kickstarter like to take 10% too, so I guess it's going to actually be a pretty tight budget."

onetruegod,3099fb,Toothpick_junction,88,Wed Mar 25 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"He's legitimately a good actor. Look at Leaving Las Vegas, Adaptation, Bad Lieutenant, etc. He's definitely a strange actor. He really isn't aiming for subdued performances. He definitely picks terrible projects. Though I've always heard that being do to his financial troubles, but that does not explain Ghostrider.   He entertains, and is rarely boring.   Plus Face/Off is probably one of the greatest movies ever made or ever will be made. But to delve into Face/Off is to go into at least a two hour rant about its brilliance."
onetruegod,3099fb,maxbaroi,42,Wed Mar 25 18:06:04 2015 UTC,but that does not explain Ghostrider.   Ghostrider was something he wanted to do just because he's always loved the comic books.    Plus Face/Off is probably one of the greatest movies ever made or ever will be made. But to delve into Face/Off is to go into at least a two hour rant about its brilliance.   With one tiny fuck up. They got the actors the wrong way around..   Why have Travolta play the mad character for 90% of the movie? Complete waste of good Cage.
onetruegod,3099fb,Frankeh,21,Wed Mar 25 18:09:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he actually has the last name ""Cage"" because he thought that Luke Cage was such a badass superhero."

Yeah, Cage doesn't get to act INSANE for a lot of the movie, but it's definitely the harder role and I don't think Travolta would have been as good. And when Cage is bad it's like manna. I only wished they had made a prequel so we got bad Cage for an entire movie. Especially if he's rocking a stache' the entire time.   Plus, I  think Travolta is way creepier than Cage. So it works for me."

onetruegod,3099fb,Turbo-Lover,16,Thu Mar 26 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Me and my boyfriend have had this theory that Nicolas Cage's performance is based on how well he is directed. To have such a varied performance from film to film may be more on how good his director is with working with him and knowing how to direct him.  It's my (subjective) opinion that Nic Cage is less an actor and more a gauge of a good director. With a talented enough person and a good script, Nicolas Cage could give one of the best performances on screen.  TL;DR Nic Cage is actually a supernatural entity that is secretly gauging the value of Hollywood directors, one movie at a time."
onetruegod,3099fb,wasdkitsu,9,Wed Mar 25 21:51:48 2015 UTC,That gives Cage too little autonomy. He's an actor. He just may be too helluva an actor for many directors. Directing Cage might be a trial akin to Jacob wrestling an angel.

onetruegod,2xqcuh,cyllibi,38,Tue Mar 3 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"What a scumbag. He's treating this kickstarter like a joke asking for an amount like that. To beat the record, this photo mosaic would need to reach around 5.5 acres in size. If we print these photos out on regular 8.5"" x 11"" paper, that means it would take roughly 368,979 sheets of paper, or let's go with 368,984 so we can lay them out 616 x 599. Neglecting all the savings we would get from printing these photos ourselves, we could get the UPS store to do it at their regular rate of $0.40 per page (for an amount over 100 pages). That comes to $147,593.60. I'm sure arranging the mosaic would take a little time, though free software exists to help with this. This project would require a large enough area to lay it all out - Windsor, OT (the kickstarter guy's hometown) has a number of parks that could accommodate this, but a permit would probably be required costing maybe a couple thousand dollars. The only thing that would remain is actually laying it all out. An undertaking like this could easily attract 600 of the Lord's followers and each one could just lay out a single row of papers, completing the project quickly once it has begun. Pre-event organization would be the biggest time sink, but I don't think it's worth $850,000. Thom Malone is not a true follower."

Nicolas Cage was one of them, and was actually nice enough to respond.  They asked him to say hi to the folks at KCIA in Valencia (or something like that), and that is what he did. I think they said one or two more things and then he had to go.   The video of the entire event was on the front page of Reddit earlier today."
