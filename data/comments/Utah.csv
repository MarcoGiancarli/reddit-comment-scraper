Utah,3e5qze,Wtj182,13,Wed Jul 22 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing, hopefully this gets even more traction. I can't believe most of the comments I've seen on Imgur and places like KSL. I'm not a huge environmentalist, but I am a user of all areas of the Wasatch, from ski resorts like Snowbird to American Fork canyon itself. I live in American Fork and get up in there very often. It really is a beautiful spot and if you knew it well, and knew of their precise plans (from lifts in Mary Ellen Gulch and down to Tibble Fork itself, to road expansion and infrastructure, to private, multi-million dollar residences clear up in Dutchman's flat), I would hope that you would do everything you could to stop this from happening.  Another point to call out is that before getting behind this and cheering it on, everyone should also educate themselves as to how this all has gone down. Mostly behind closed doors, with lots of money passed around, outside of the county lines where they actually have a right to make decisions, and without including those parties in Utah County that should have been aware of the proceedings from day one. They've tried to go behind our backs as residents of Utah County and users of the AF Canyon watershed and we've had a legal right to be involved.  Please inform yourselves and do what you can to help keep the canyon as it is and not a torn up playground for only those who can afford to pay what will most definitely be an inflated ticket price to enjoy our ""public"" lands."

Flaming Gorge has some great scenic byways that go north-south on both sides of the park and they're really fun and beautifully surreal drives. I've never stopped and done any rafting or anything there but a lot of people go there for water sports.   Goblin Valley is just awesome because it is never crowded and it is such a strange landscape. It makes you feel like a termite. Plus you can climb on the rocks and that's fun. There's tons to explore there.  Of course, if you want to see something purely Utah there is delicate arch at Arches NP. :) That's a nice hike and nice area (love Moab) but I prefer the state parks."

It's pretty--- but that is not the way to go!  IF you have the time, take US-24 south from Green River I-70 and drive it through Hanksville, then over through Capitol Reef to Torrey. (on the way is Goblin Valley and Little Wild Horse Canyon both are spectacular stops!) Hit up all the great Capitol Reef doings, including getting some FRESH FRUIT and a pie, etc. etc. Use UT-12 to get to Bryce; this is one of those roads you'll talk about for the rest of your life. If you hit it at the right time it will change your life. UT-12 cuts through the Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument. If you have time, hike Calf Creek Falls and maybe head down hole-in-the-rock road to Spooky and Peek-A-Boo slots, or just stick a toe in the Escalante River when the highway crosses (there's plenty of parking) make a pit stop at Kiva Koffee!!   If you head south (past Bryce) on UT-89 you can enter Zion through the tunnel entrance; the most spectacular way to see Zion for a first-time visit.

Utah,3dihh4,kvnm,2,Fri Jul 17 06:59:23 2015 UTC,Saying that somebody needs to create a new subreddit is just a little bit too low and detracting from the conversation.  You might have a point with regard that this is just a call to get organized rather than anything serious that is being done by the Bernie Sanders campaign itself.  Pointing out that perhaps those involved should have posted instead on /r/sandersforpresident (an actual subreddit with people making regular and frequent posts) or better yet posting on this particular thread would have gone a whole lot further to both point out where they should have gone instead and make a meaningful contribution.

Utah,3ddtn2,akaabefroman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"It's 3 miles and takes about 2 hours. It could be done in less time but wouldn't be as enjoyable. The loop starts/ends at the two most popular viewpoints in the park (Sunset and Sunrise Points) so you don't have to go out of the way to get to it.

If you are coming back from Arches, take Scenic Route 24 from Green River and drive through the San Rafel Swell to Capitol Reef national park.  It's a neat drive, and you'll get a good overview of what Capiol Reef has to offer when you invariably come back.  Then, meet up with Scenic Route 12, which takes you to Bryce Canyon.  It goes through the Grand Staircase - Escalante national monument.  This is in my opinion, one of the best drives in all of Utah, if not the desert SW as a whole. The trip drops you right off in Bryce Canyon.  Best of all the worlds."

As far as the race thing, I'm sure utah has it's racists, but for the most part it should not be an issue. There are plenty of hispanic people here. I think you should be fine.  The inversion is just trapped pollution because of air currents. Depending on where you are and weather, it can get bad, but i don't know if that would affect lung cancer. Many other big cities have similar or worse pollution problems.  Snowfall in november is a gamble. There could be no snow on the ground, there could be a foot. Either way main roads should be plowed, so you should be fine unless there is a storm while you are arriving. (side note: once you do get here and it snows, find a big empty parking lot and learn how your car handles in the snow)  As far as time to move in, it will probably depend on the place. ask around.

Utah,3cytu6,seane,2,Sun Jul 12 13:58:21 2015 UTC,"Other commenters provided some great responses, OP, but I'm gonna weigh in on the inversion thing, because it's the reason I moved AWAY from SLC.    I lived in Florida (East Coast!) from 1998 to 2007.  I LOVED Salt Lake City.  It had a level of depth and culture that I felt central Florida severely lacked.  I loved the lack of humudity, the presence of actual seasons, and all the great things to see and explore in the city.    But the inversion.  It is awful.  If you stay in the city while it's hanging around, you kind of don't realize how awful you start to feel.  At least, that is my (and my wife's) experience.  You wake up with a scratchy throat.  Your head hurts and you feel a couple points stupider.  If you stay in it for too long, your lungs start to feel like you've been running outside in the cold (except, you know, you haven't).    In December it gets rough, but in January it gets SUPER bad.  There was one January, 2013, I think, where we went close to a month with below freezing temps.  Cold is a big part of what makes the inversion happen, and so the cold created the inversion, and the inversion reinforced the cold (as it doesn't let warm air come in unless a strong weather front blows through).  Anyway.  It was bad.  We would go on day trips to Park City and Eden to get away from it.  And seriously, you don't realize how bad you feel until that crisp, clear air hits you.  I'm not saying this to try and scare you away from moving to Salt Lake.  It's a wonderful city, but I wanted to share my experience and how much it affected my family.  If you're going to move to the area, try and choose a city that doesn't get a lot of pollution and inversion.  Several times each year, Salt Lake City, Ogden, and Provo have some of the worst air in the NATION.  My wife and I ended up moving, from living literally RIGHT downtown (600 S 200 E) to south eastern Utah, a very rural town 40 minute drive from Moab.  In the end, it's all about what matters to you.  Clean air mattered a whole lot, and luckily we both work from home, and are lucky in other ways, and were able to move to a town that suited us better.    Good luck with your house hunting!  Utah is a lovely state, a real hidden gem.  If you can find somewhere suitable to live outside the ""I-15 corridor"" you'll probably escape the inversion/pollution (but also, I think Toole gets some nasty pollution at times, so really do your homework).    Here's what we use to monitor the air quality:  http://www.airnow.gov/  Here's an article showing SLC having the worst air in the nation, from 2012:  http://www.ksl.com/?sid=28213550  Here's a look at the cities with the highest number of ""unhealthy days"" (an air quality rating) from 2013 and 2014:  http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/images/pmcharts/2014PM25SeasonReviewFigure.jpg  ""4 of 5 of the most polluted spots in the nation are here in Ogden, Logan, and Salt Lake City:"" (from 2011)  http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/51006311-76/pollution-utah-county-lake.html.csp  Anyway, it typically is only for a few weeks every winter, and then again in June/July (especially if there are bad wildfires in Cali/Nevada, as those get blown into the valley and again, trapped).    I hope this was helpful.  I just wanted you to be informed about the air.  It's something I'm clearly passionate (and biased) about.  Good luck!

Utah,3cytu6,Pokemon5475,2,Sun Jul 12 16:04:27 2015 UTC,I can answer 1 and 3.   Herriman is an awesome place. Such a good community. Same with Daybreak. I can see it in an airplane. I can see it basically year round from the roof of the University of Utah.
Utah,3cytu6,theoriginalharbinger,2,Sun Jul 12 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on where you're working. Salt lake City proper, West Jordan, South Jordan, Draper, and Sandy are all good choices with fast access to Salt Lake City downtown area. I see that you're working from home, but if you've got an occasional need to go into the office, this may be a consideration. Most of the tech companies are clustered around Draper and the point of the mountain in South Salt Lake Valley. Like anywhere else, what you can afford will be a compromise between price and location.   You also didn't mention if that 1300 includes utilities. 1300 will get you a decent house in the 'burbs with a one car garage and utilities if you look around.   2) Nobody will care. There's a krishna temple in Spanish Fork of all places, and SLC has a variety of mosques. People may be curious about it, and may be uncertain how to treat you. Some people will be so fearful of offending your cultural norms that they won't invite you for dinner (ie, they won't know if you can eat pork, or beef, or any kind of meat at all, and thus will try to keep a certain distance to avoid offending you if you're Indian).  3) It can get bad at times, but it's no worse than LA / Central Valley if you're familiar with that.   4) You roll the dice here. Early November, you're fine. late November, there may or may not be snowfall.  5) Go to ksl.com or rentler.com and start looking for places. You can go from a phone call to cash delivered to move-in in under two weeks if you rent from a family-owned operation. I'm a landlord, and the process can move quickly depending on what I'm renting out."
Utah,3cytu6,AvatarJack,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"Salt Lake is really diverse so I wouldn't worry about racism. You'll probably get more flack for not being Mormon, if anything. Inversion can be bad or not so bad, I doubt it's bad enough to give you cancer unless that was all your breathed for 40 years. And snowfall in November isn't uncommon but last winter we barely had any snow at all so it's a toss up really, we take care of our roads though so don't worry too much. (Just take it nice and easy if it's your first time driving in snow. No hard braking, drive slowly and watch for ice. If you do hit ice, don't jerk the wheel or slam on the brake just point the wheels and coast.)  As for where to live, SLC is just one city in Salt Lake Valley. There's a ton of cities all crammed together. You'll easily be able to find something nice for that budget. A general rule of thumb is you want to aim for a place and far north-east as you can afford because that's the nicest area."
Utah,3cytu6,orcie101,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:30:48 2015 UTC,"1) I think Salt Lake is a wonderful place; however, if you don't want to be in the big city, I would suggest North Salt Lake or Bountiful. Those are both pretty good areas. They're out of the main city, but still close enough to easily get to downtown in 10-15 minutes. I may be able to even hook you guys up with my friend that's a realtor.  2) You really would be fine pretty much anywhere along the Wasatch Front. I know that sometimes we get a bad rap, but most of us are really kind and welcoming, especially in SLC, which is actually a pretty liberal city.  3) The inversion can sometimes be an issue, but just keep an eye on the air quality. You'd be OK on mostly any day except a Red Air day, then I'd stay inside, or even go on a hike to get out of it, which is quite rewarding :)  4) As stated by somebody else, the snowfall is a gamble, but for the most part, I'd say there's usually not a ton  5) From what I've seen, the renting process isn't too bad, but ya, it probably just depends on the place and the owner.  Good luck! I hope you find Utah inviting, we'd be thrilled to have you! :)"
Utah,3cytu6,WalropsHunter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the race thing will be a problem. There are racists everywhere of course but I DON'T think it's particularly worse in Salt Lake. It is considered a conservative state, but it's SO conservative that there's an alternative mentality that fights that LDS / conservative idea. We have been high on the ""gay friendly"" and ""alternative lifestyle"" community lists over the last for years. It sounds surprising to an outsider but it's true. I grew up in Taylorsville and my elementary school was very diverse. Cottonwood Heights where my cousins grew up was a very white community but there were a lot of Indian families up there that they were friends with.   What are your ideals, what do you hold important and what is your week and weekend life like? There are a lot of options around here, from lively nightlife to quiet family oriented neighborhoods."
Utah,3cytu6,Qurtys_Lyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"We can have snow anywhere from September to June, but we usually don't have much other than random storms until late December."
Utah,3cytu6,urban_misfit,0,Sun Jul 12 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"Really.....I mean reallllllllyyyyyyy research the air quality issues in SLC to determine if you want to move here. If you have family history of lung issues (cancer, emphysema, or asthma) breathing in PM2.5 and PM10 during our inversion seasons is less than ideal for optimal physical health."

You'll get three different types of landlords in Utah -- small owner/manager (mom and pop types), rental agencies that represent mom-and-pop types, and large-scale owner/operators (typical apartment complex). I'm a landlord of a couple small properties, btw.  Everybody will run a felony record check and a credit check. However, the mom-and-pop types tend to be more forgiving if you've got a ready explanation at hand and you are upfront about it if the misdemeanor shows. Also depends on the type of misdemeanor. Forget to pay a parking ticket and get a bench warrant issued? Sure, I can let that go. Get busted for illegal restraint (ie, water-downed kidnapping)? That's a mess I definitely don't want to deal with. As long as it's not a financial crime (landlords like getting paid) or a crime of violence you've got a good shot."

There's already precedent for churches to lose their tax free status and many have been pushing the line or outright ignoring it those are the ones we should be going after, but we shouldn't push the line further. Let social progress and pressure change policy, not government pressure.  We fought for equal rights and we have a major victory. A legal one which is all we can reasonably ask for.

But the problem here is that there are actually two different things that we call ""marriage,"" civil marriage and religious marriage. I do not want, nor should anyone else, to change the autonomy of religion. I want churches to conduct the ceremonies they want to when it comes to religious marriage. If they want to not marry gays, or even interracial couples, I want them to be able to do that (though I've got no problem calling then backward assholes). I just want everyone who wants to to be able to enter into the civil contract we also call ""marriage,"" to be able to walk down to the courthouse and be married. That's all."

Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album.

Rapid Wave used to have operations out there, but like every other WISP in the valley, got bought my Digis, and had their service correspondingly degraded.  Let me repeat in case you get tempted: Don't use Digis.  Vivint's service is mesh-based. They've been touting it heavily, but as with all mesh services, it will choke down depending on upstream usage. The few people I've spoken to that have used it have hated it.  If you need a semi-reliable alternative and you don't have access to a cabled solution (ie, Comcast or Centurylink), Innovative Air is one I'd recommend.  Centurylink, post-Qwest, is actually pretty good. I have a rental unit that's been on CL now for years and years and I've never had a connection drop. It's a 5/1 connection (5mbps down, 1 up), but has relatively low latency and, unlike the WISP services, is not subject to bad weather screwing it up.  I'm not familiar with DirectCOM, but anybody touting 1gbps (and Veracity just started advertising 10gbps speeds) is selling marketing fluff. Most routers can handle 1gbps, but 802.11n only supports 54mbps per spatial stream. So if you're using WiFi in your house, you're likely never going to see download speeds in excess of 50-100mbps depending on how many other people are on it. 802.11ac is a bit better, but not a lot of devices on it, and not many support the required number of spatial streams to get a gig worth of throughput through it."

I'm going to dodge your actual question and answer a question one level up.  Should you buy a home in Eagle Mountain?  No. No, I really don't think it's advisable.  The place is run even more poorly than average for small cities. There are infrastructure problems, yet they spend upwards of a hundred thousand dollars per year on lobbying in DC. I mean, maybe if that lobbying money brings in more Federal funding for things than what goes out on the lobbying, sure...but if I were one of EM's just ~25,000 residents, I'd really wonder about the propriety of that spending.  You've got one grocery store and two gas stations, if you live on The Ranches side of town. Out by where Town Hall is? Might as well make the 10+ minute trip to Smith's or Walmart.  I could go on. Maybe your mind is made up, or maybe some Dark and Potent Force compels you to live there.  I just don't think it's the best option. Lehi is okay, kinda."

They illegally reduced a posted speed limit from 25 to 15 without conducting the traffic survey required by state law, so now any speeding tickets in that zone are all but unenforceable.  There are huge drainage problems every spring in some parts of the city because the sewer/water runoff system wasn't planned right. That made national headlines and even featured prominently on the front page of /r/all a couple of years ago - really hurt property values, resale prospects, and the ability to get homeowner's insurance in the affected areas.

I pay for a 250/100 line and it rarely has any issues.  Their upload cap is 100mbps, though.   From what I can tell, about a quarter of EM is covered by their fiber.  It'll be several years before all of EM is covered, though.  Vivint is also starting an over the air service, which a friend users and reports to get about 50/50 consistently, though we have yet to see any major weather so I'm not sure how that will be affected.   TLDR, get on directcom's chat on their website and give them your potential address, they can give you your options.   Source:  I live in Eagle Mountain."

Utah,3at2yx,DesolationRobot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:15:45 2015 UTC,"They found out because The Guardian published a list of people he'd donated to after it came out that he was the shooter's inspiration. I don't think a $1,000 donation gets you high enough on any national-office campaign radar that you get looked in to personally.  If you're writing five or six digit checks to the PAC then, yeah, they probably do some due diligence in to who you are.  Edit: but I suppose neither of us actually knows what best practices are for vetting campaign donors and whether or not Love's campaign followed those practices. I'm just saying I'd give any politician on that list the benefit of the doubt that they haven't proactively looked in to every individual donor."
Utah,3auiey,rumple_fore_skin,4,Tue Jun 23 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"Here is my quick list of ideas, it all depends on how much time you have, I have lived and played here almost my whole life and haven't seen or done it all let alone in a few days..   Golden Spike Pretty far off the path, but really cool historical spot.  Thanksgiving Point they have an awesome Dinosaur Museum  Timpanogas Cave It takes some time due to the hike but it is awesome!!  Goblin Valley Also consider hiking nearby little wildhorse canyon if weather permits.. Flash floods.   hike to Lower Calf Creek Falls one day I visited here and the Arizona State women's volleyball team was skinny dipping.. best day of my 17 year old life...  Bryce Canyon Zion and Arches are nice but don't leave out Bryce. It is up high and sometimes a bit cooler. The summer evenings are incredible. Hike the canyon! even if you use it just as an overnight stop you can get into the canyon and hike and be on your way to Zion before too late in the morning.   get on the river in Moab (Arches) Simple 'Daily' Raft Trip with easy logistics (not ecessive time commitment) or spend the time and a few more dollars and do  WestWater Canyon both links are very credible outfitters. Both offer the 'daily' or Westwater Canyon trips.   Park City Mountain Resort and some of the other resorts have fun things to do like ziplines, lift served Mtn biking, etc.. just riding the lift can be fun in the summer. Park city and Sundance Mtn Resort have good options. Sundance is closer to the I15 if that is an issue. There is amazing hiking and driving (a little tight depending on the size of the RV on the road up and over the Mountain from Timpanogas Cave to the Sundance resort. The drive is called the Alpine Loop.    Thats is what I got for now.. If you like the list ask for more.. there are amazing hidden gems here in Utah. These are some of the ones I am not afraid to tell the tourists!! :-)"

The company is pretty awesome to work for. In the wake of the Sun acquisition, what happened is that we preserved Oracle's management culture but inherited Sun's engineering culture. This was a very intentional decision by management, and so far it's working beautifully: bringing in the cash Sun desperately needed, along with the infusion of innovation and knowledge capital Oracle desperately needed.  Within Oracle, you can imagine it as a bunch of small teams that happen to work with one another to deliver a product. You'll often discover two or three other teams working in parallel on similar products, and what tends to happen is that one of them ""wins"" over the course of a few years, and the other teams get split up to work on other projects (or folded into the main project). We work hard to keep good talent, including raises, bonuses, stock options, stock RSUs, etc.  The net effect is most people on the Development side end up working in an environment similar to a distributed start-up, but with access to big resources and tremendous knowledge and peer engineering when needed.  We are in desperate need of project managers with data center experience (or who live close to a data center so they can GET data center experience). The sad reality is that most PMs don't live near enough to data centers to have any idea what the boots-on-the-ground SAs experience, and I know our PMO is hiring.  Contact me privately if you want to leapfrog the HR screening process with a referral. Otherwise hit oracle.com/careers yourself and fill out some forms. Important tip: don't just look for jobs in ""Utah"". Nine times out of ten we don't really care where you live; we care about the time zones you cover, when you can be available, and your ability to work with remote peers. Living in Utah gives you easy access to two of our major data centers, and for a PM (when we need PMs that understand data center work) that would be a gigantic leg up on your out-of-state competition.  My two cents. I know ""Oracle is evil"" is a popular meme, but it's a really solid place to work. While we don't have a basketball court, gymnasium, on-site masseuse, etc. like one of our competitors in Lehi (we have that stuff at some other sites, nothing here... yet), we pay well, innovate constantly, have great health & dental, are profitable while not living on venture funding, and have other benefits beat the socks off of most of the start-up competition in the area..."

They can basically look at anyone, see what they've been prescribed since data collection started, and if an officer thinks there is a potential for abuse then suddenly they have the right to enter your home and ask to see all your prescriptions...which can then lead to insane stories like this one  Since I recently had major surgery and got a large quantity of good painkillers, this database is troubling to me.  Now in and of itself, the database is just one fairly small thing I'm using as an example of silly, intrusive laws they pass here because of the Mormon majority in government.  Also the crime rate is rising steadily and ""safe"" areas of town are shrinking, but that's pretty much any major city or state capitol."
Utah,39vjd5,LudicrousGibs,3,Mon Jun 15 05:22:24 2015 UTC,Not anymore.  The governor recently signed a law that said officers need a warrant before they can access the database.

Utah,39vjd5,LudicrousGibs,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"I moved to Denver, Colorado for about 4 years, then moved back here 4 years ago. No regrets...I do wish however, we had liquor stores like they do in Colorado.  Salt Lake is pretty awesome."
Utah,39vjd5,Guidopunker,3,Mon Jun 15 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"I moved to Denver, Colorado for about 4 years, then moved back here 4 years ago   Yep. You can escape as far as a low orbit, but eventually you fall right back down.  Upon retiring from a glorious military career, I could have gone just about anywhere. In fact, I did - instead of getting a place right away, I bought a van and drove around for a year, although I somehow missed the opportunity to park it by the river.  Point being, just about anywhere. Portland? Greenwich Village? Mystic, PA? Forks?  Nope. Right back in good ole' SLC and here for the duration, apparently. :)"

Utah,39vjd5,DesertCedar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"It's beautiful here in all but the ugliest parts of town, and even those have a pretty good view of the beautiful bits.  It's a sizeable metropolis with access to more or less anything you want, and yet you can get from the heart of downtown to deep deep in the mountains in 20 minutes.  People are pretty chill here, by and large. We have good colleges and universities (with a few notable exceptions), and for the most part you can find a job after you graduate. The cost of living is pretty low for a metropolitan area, especially the utilites - natural gas, water, and electricity (as far as I know) are among the cheapest in the nation, and gasoline prices are consistently below average as well.  EDIT: Oh, and apparently a study says that Utah is one of the safest states in the nation.  Things to watch out for:  Someone mentioned aggressive drivers, but sa a Californian that is probably not a concern for you (yes, I'm indulging a stereotype). At least you're not stuck doing the speed limit behind everone else like you are in Kansas. Oh. My. GOD.  Uh, other things to be concerned about. Hmm. If you're a recreational drug enjoyer, be careful to the point of paranoia. There's a law that any drug crime (possession, consumption, thinging about them) within 1000 feet of a school, church, or public parking lot significantly enhances the penalties. Well, those qualifiers manage to cover about 95% of the Valley (the greater metropolitan area as opposed to Salt Lake City proper) these days.  Bars close early, liquor stores have crappy hours and are closed on Sundays, and all that sort of stuff you probably already knew."
Utah,39vjd5,Ralt,2,Tue Jun 16 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"This about covers it. Thanks again for your input. I do part take in drug use (nothing hardcore), but rarely. For me to live there and enjoy the city definetly is not a problem to quit drugs. Besides, Colorado isn't too far. I really hope I can move in the beginning of next year. I'm seeking freedom from california. Its a great state, just not the overly stupid gun/drug laws, overly high standard of living, traffic and over population.  BTW, you guys have great public transport system. Everywhere I drove I saw the trax stations."
Utah,39vjd5,DeadSeaGulls,2,Tue Jun 16 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"Whoa, easy there with the ""great public transport system"" business.  The Utah Transit Authority makes the system look good at first glance, and I am glad they finally put light rail in, and then expanded it to the airport and a couple of carefully-chosen suburbs.  That said, it is one of the most expensive systems in the nation to ride. It barely-if-at-all runs on Sundays and holidays (because no one needs to make it to work on those days), and they have this weird privatized-yet-official law enforcement that can ban you form using the system with zero due process on the say-so of any ""officer.""  Whoa, man, don't get me started on the UTA."

Utah,39iuja,American_Buffalo,4,Fri Jun 12 00:48:13 2015 UTC,Becker and Burbank have been political enemies almost since day 1.  It was just a matter if time before one of them got the upper hand.
Utah,39iuja,SgtBrowncoat,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Ugh, as much as I dislike Burbank, he's being made a scapegoat. Yes, he screwed up the handling of this situation, but there's more at play here.  Becker is getting to make look like an idiot over letting this happen by his opponents. He wants to look good, so he has to do something. He can't fire Findlay (because he's gone), and he can't take away Findlay's benefits. So what does he do? He fires the guy who should have fired Findlay but didn't.  Becker looks like a moron here, because he had stated that he would let Burbank handle personnel matters within the PD, saying that he didn't have full knowledge of the situation. Now that the situation (and lawsuit) is impacting his ability to get re-elected, he's taking action. If Becker truly had an issue with the way Burbank had handled Findlay, he should have fired Findlay himself.  Burbank has done a lot right as chief, but this is one situation where the cronyism in police departments causes massive problems."
Utah,39iuja,spangborn,0,Fri Jun 12 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"Gosh Mayor, you can't ask them to cross that thin blue line of impunity. Sure, if it had been a citizen they would have been fired and likely had charges placed against them, but when you are a cop you get paid leave and retirement."
Utah,39iuja,bluuit,-3,Fri Jun 12 15:32:44 2015 UTC,Good.
Utah,39iuja,gthing,4,Fri Jun 12 06:27:27 2015 UTC,"I heard a couple of his interviews and he seemed like a fair police chief. I have not followed this story so I need to catch up, but my impression was that people liked him."
Utah,39iuja,F-That,5,Fri Jun 12 12:14:07 2015 UTC,"Chief Burbank was a stand up police chief. He was a major ally to the lgbt community, he was involved at a community level, and he managed to turn the SLPD into a capable organization. He was a valuable asset that is being cast aside because of Becker's political play. This has nothing to do with ethics, but getting votes for the mayoral election."
Utah,39iuja,SilentGuardian1776,-1,Fri Jun 12 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"he managed to turn the SLPD into a capable organization   well SLCPD did manage to shoot fewer pets and black kids than surrounding areas, so I'll give them that.."
