B: Giving a solution to combos (which, by the way, have been a part of the game of Magic since the very, very beginning) that doesn't involve having a independently arbitrated intervention with your LGS or playgroup about why certain win conditions hurt everyone's feelings and others are okay."
EDH,3e44w7,Dutchling,-10,Tue Jul 21 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"There's nothing commendable about not communicating expectations to other players.  That is, in fact, part of the definition of a social contract.  And on here, we tend to think communicating with your playgroup about the social contract is a good thing."
EDH,3e44w7,AdOutAce,9,Tue Jul 21 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"Or! You can read the OP and realize most of the things you thought were two card ""instant win"" combos are actually super fragile.  Sometimes, losing to a ""lame"" combo means your own deck is the unfun and uninteractive one."
EDH,3e44w7,R_V_Z,4,Tue Jul 21 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in favor of communication. It's just inflated to a completely hilarious degree on this subreddit. Since the beginning of time people have been having fun beating their friends in games. EDH is no different. It's not a fragile ecosystem of optimizing play experiences. It's a game. Play to win and have fun doing it. If you lose a lot, learn to have fun doing that. The social contract goes both ways."
EDH,3e44w7,logopolys_,7,Tue Jul 21 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"Actually Trike is on the battlefield until its trigger resolves. Trike is naturally a 1/1, thus the reason for pinging itself. This presents a window where a 1 damage ping is on the stack and Trike is still on the battlefield. This is where you want to swords/path/reality shift."
EDH,3e44w7,R_V_Z,4,Tue Jul 21 20:40:17 2015 UTC,Trike is actually a 2/2 when Mikaeus is out.  He uses the last two counters to kill himself as part of the combo.  You can this fact to survive an extra turn if someone missequences the combo.
EDH,3e44w7,logopolys_,0,Tue Jul 21 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"With Mike out, yeah. Some Trike combos exist outside of Mike (Grenzo Combo comes to mind). Essentially taking care of Trike with damage on the stack targeting itself is the way to go."

EDH,3e44w7,Dutchling,4,Tue Jul 21 23:58:07 2015 UTC,My playgroup should read this. They seem to think wrath effects are EDH staples while single use spot removal isn't worth running.  And then they let me untap with my Zealous Conscripts.

EDH,3e44w7,R_V_Z,2,Tue Jul 21 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"Yep. With no counterspells (I literally haven't seen any so far, even in mono blue decks) and few spot removal spells, you tend to need one quickly though. Stuff gets out of hand fast if everything you cast just resolves and lives.  This is the main reason I haven't build a goodstuff deck yet. The games would last forever. I much prefer a quick Edric game."
EDH,3e44w7,taschneide,3,Tue Jul 21 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"I'll add to what OP has stated by suggesting that, in general, just pack a decent amount of versatile, efficient removal in your decks. 12-15 cards that can remove problems is a pretty decent number without taking up too much space in a deck. I can understand if you don't want to but if you want to lose to the combo player every time go right ahead. But if you pack a solid amount of decent removal/disruption in your deck in the first place your games will be more social because of interaction and thus more fun. Split second spells and permissions effects are your friend sometimes too btw, if that combo player is always backing up their combo with counters/etc. Also, as far as what kind of removal you run I HIGHLY recommend to try to stick with mostly instant speed, cheap answers that cost 3 or less mana. (Maybe 2-4 boardwipes that are sorcery speed - but even then turnabout and cyclonic rift do the job just as well at instant speed) Counterspells like Hinder aren't as good anymore due to the tuck rule change and I'd rather have something like Pact of Negation, Remand, or Arcane Denial over a Hinder, Voidslime, Counterflux or other 3+ mana counterspell because its quite common to encounter decks that will disrupt your mana sources too. You might not have that three mana up/otherwise available every time when you need it but 1 or 2 mana is much more likely. I will always run something like Path to Exile or Swan Song over other, costlier options. Really, as far as counters go, you don't even need to run a wall of them either. Don't underestimate spot removal nor the effect of just playing blue has on people. I actually only ever run 2-3 counterspells in an entire blue deck and people still tempo themselves behind in fear of being countered even if I don't actually have one in hand."
EDH,3e44w7,Dutchling,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"On that note:  Sword to Plowshares, Path to Exile, Pongify, Rapid Hybridization, Unsummon, Vapor Snag, Murderous Cut, Tragic Slip. One mana, instant-speed ways of taking care of a creature for at least a turn.   Nature's Claim, Crumble, Demystify, Oxidize, Smelt. One mana, instant speed ways of taking care of artifacts and/or enchantments."
EDH,3e44w7,R_V_Z,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I vastly prefer Ghost Quarter to Strip Mine. The latter is infamous, and can occasionally make people hate you for playing land destruction. Yes, I know that there are some lands you need to destroy; that's why I suggest Ghost Quarter. It takes care of any problematic lands, but gives the targeted land's controller a basic land (untapped, even) to prevent the feel-bad of having a land of yours destroyed. It comes with a side-effect of punishing greedy mana bases that don't run many basics. Also, in a worst-case scenario, you can Ghost Quarter yourself if you're getting color-screwed."
EDH,3e44w7,Dutchling,5,Tue Jul 21 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer Strip Mine because sometimes it just reads: ""target player loses the game"", especially if you play with people who think you can play 5c with a budget mana base :P  And since you play with 3 opponents I don't think cards like this are really that bad. You are putting two of your three opponents a land ahead, after all!"

If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in APNAP order, puts triggered abilities he or she controls on the stack in any order he or she chooses. (See rule 101.4.) Then the game once again checks for and resolves state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.  The triggers for Kiki-Jiki creature tokens and Reins of Power will all go on the stack at the same time. If you put the token triggers on the stack first, they will be returned, and you can't sacrifice creatures you don't control. You have to put the Reins of Power trigger on the stack first, then the token triggers on top of it. You sacrifice all the tokens, then return everything else."
EDH,3e44w7,SpyglassSuperior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"The disappearance is inherently part of his ability. So regardless of who controls them they will poof at EoT as a delayed trigger.

Maybe that's just me, but I would very much not appreciate this if I were the combo player. If someone wins, you scoop. You don't play on without them. Hell, even if you have a way to stop the combo, why would you want to do so? You can just let the combo player ""win"" and he'll be gone: one player less to kill.  I mean, if your entire playgroup thinks this is an acceptable thing to do, you're obviously not being dicks!

Idk. It's basically saying, look, you got to have your fun and got to combo off and win the game, but none of us had any fun that match or got to do anything at all, so we're going to continue on and you can join in next match.

EDH,3e2jfr,MTGCardFetcher,5,Tue Jul 21 20:05:08 2015 UTC,Take a look at Grenzo and see how you feel about him.
EDH,3e2jfr,apocalypseSampler,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Im not a huge fan of Grenzo, Kaervek, or Olivia, but I do like Rakdos and Malfegor for EDH. When I get home ill post my lists for both.  Ok, here's what I have:  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/05-12-14-malfegor-edh/   Malfegor is a weird commander, because at first glance he seems to incarnate the exact opposite of what you want in EDH, which is card advantage. By discarding your hand, you leave yourself with no answers and few things to do, with the relatively small benefit of wiping opponents' boards (and circumventing all protections but that one no-sacrifice angel).   What Malfegor appears to want, and what I think is a egregious mistake many who use him make, is Madness/Hellbent. But when you consider what those cards in your hand are worth to Malfegor, in reality you want nothing but massive draw engines. View Malfegor as a spellshaper that allows you to throw extra lands, early reanimation spells, and spells rendered obsolete by the gamestate into the graveyard as a 6 mana mass edict effect. By that thinking, keeping a fresh supply of cards in your hand not only becomes necessary to survive, but paramount to your strategy. This is the Malfegor I enjoy playing.   http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/22-11-14-rakdos-edh/  To be perfectly honest, my Rakdos deck isn't special or unique. When people see Rakdos, they see a hyper aggressive deck with red pingers and black bombs, and that's exactly the environment you need to play to make him successful. If I had to make a analogy for the deck in some fashion, I'd say you essentially play the deck like a shark. Try to get that one tiny drop of blood out of an opponent turns 3-5, and let the carnage flow from there. Of course, against super control decks Rakdos fails, but I think that basically every red/black deck is going to suffer the same fate in that regard."

That said, for high-money items and for higher-cost items that I want more copies of, I'll check ebay for a deal. I remember getting 3 Pact of Negation for 27 bucks when they were each about 11 or 12 each. Seems worth it now."

EDH,3e4tu6,almenereneth,2,Tue Jul 21 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"Despite the surface similarity to EDH, the mana cost cap and small deck size meant the decks were functionally Legacy decks, with many of the same cards/strategies and similar speed and consistency.

EDH appeals to people who want to do big, splashy things with giant dragons and such, for which no other format really provides."

With your original card pool, I wasn't seeing any really easy ways to win off of Enter the Infinite/Omniscience, or stall until you have a good position up to do silly things like this. This is why I suggested Pact as a wincon.  Diluvian Primordial is another one I just thought of since Spelltwine is a pretty decent card and you're going to be milling.

EDH,3e4ojz,jonasknight8,2,Tue Jul 21 22:51:05 2015 UTC,"imo there's three basic ways of building an EDH deck:  1) Get a commander you happen to own, and add cards you also happen to own. This obviously only works if you have a huge collection or if the people you play with are super casual. After that just compare your curve and land count with other decks that look like yours and adjust your deck appropriately.   2) Get a precon. Most if not all precons are decent out of the box, and even if you only have a small collection you probably have a few cards that you can add to improve the deck. Unless the people you play with are super spikey a precon will be a great deck to begin playing EDH with.  3) Pick a commander that looks fun to you, and look at what other people use. I'm sure you've seen EDHREC linked a lot in this sub, and it's probably the best tool to learn how typical EDH decks look like. If you're new to both EDH and Magic in general, this is probably not a very good option.  Personally I went with option three. Now, to be fair, I picked Edric as my first Commander and ""Flying Men Edric"" is pretty much a solved deck, so I only really had to find cheaper alternatives to the more expensive cards to keep it within my budget."
EDH,3e4ojz,Dutchling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"Lands- A commander deck usually has around 38 lands. You can use less if you only use a single color. Basic lands are fine, but cards like [[Evolving Wilds]] and [[Terramorphic Expanse]] are cheap and great in two or three color decks. Fetch lands, dual lands, shock lands, and trilands are all great for mana fixing, but not necessary for your first deck. Lands with some ability besides making mana is always good if it fits in the deck, because lands are more difficult to get rid of than creatures, but they aren't necessary if you don't have any.  Sorceries, instants, planeswalkers- In formats like modern and standard, sorcery, instant and planeswalker cards can be really powerful. In edh, not so much. They still have the potential to be, but a 3 damage [[Lightning Bolt]] isn't very powerful where 9/9s can run rampant and you start with 40 life. Targeted spells lose a lot of power in a 4 player game as well, so spells that say 'each player' or 'each opponent' are usually better. The same sort of rule goes for planeswalkers. A card like [[Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver]] isn't as strong as [[Liliana of the Veil]] that makes everyone discard a card. The better walkers in commander help your deck's strategy, by drawing cards or making tokens.  Creatures- The most important part of creatures in edh is the words 'enters the battlefield'. Since so much damage is needed to kill someone in the game, most of your creatures in the early game won't matter. ETB effects make them matter. They ramp or draw cards or kill something or bounce something else. Big creatures are great finishers, huge spells for lots of damage are fantastic, but a two or three drop creature that gets you a land is better because it will help you get to the end of the game."

EDH,3e0dnr,R_V_Z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"I agree any deck that takes over the game regularly because it is so fine tuned becomes a problem. Everyone starts to gang up on the obvious threat and in turn that person can feel like they are being pushed out of the game or can't be a part of it.  There is a player in my Meta who plays a fine tuned expensive marchessa deck and hes aggressive with it. Naturally because his deck easily puts counters on his creatures the attacks come without much if any penalty to his board...  so when the group can they suppress him as much possible and generally most of the answers gets directed at his board and it ends up being the table against marchessa until everyone feels comfortable enough to defend against his board which usually just leaves him with a card in hand pulling lands off top deck.    He's the type who really enjoys building fine tuned decks. He appreciates the synergy and how well the deck operates, etc but while deck building thinks of nothing else but his own enjoyment. Hes the type of guy who always names black with Iona when I am playing Drana... _^   Yes I have answers in my deck for it but its 80% because of the prevalance of IONA. At the very least it can also remove problem enchantments and artifacts in others deck but rarely do I draw any of them in either case."
EDH,3e0dnr,MinervaMedica000,0,Tue Jul 21 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  The more that's decided mechanically by the cards, the less there is to be decided socially.  When the $5000 combo deck can lock everyone out of playing until it gets its infinite-exile combo into place, there's not much to be done socially.  Casual play is just better fitted to a social experience because the cards answer so much less mechanically that the players have to handle more of the situation socially."
EDH,3e0dnr,SpyglassSuperior,0,Tue Jul 21 12:34:11 2015 UTC,"I like throwing ""simple as that"" I the end of what is actually an incredibly thorny and complex set of implicit expectations, unwritten rules, and silent presumptions.  ""Just match your deck to your social situation"" is a little like saying ""just fix the economy by making the numbers work."" (Or, more charitably, ""balance the economy by maintaining a balance of imports and exports while controlling inflation. Simple as that."")  Your advice isn't useless, per se, but it's describing an end goal rather than the steps for reaching that goal."
EDH,3e0dnr,TheLibertinistic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"Your problem is that you are assuming that expectations have to be implicit, rules unwritten and presumptions silent. My point has been and continues to be that upfront communication solves the most common problems people seem to have."
EDH,3e0dnr,R_V_Z,15,Tue Jul 21 18:25:38 2015 UTC,"I also like the comparisons to LARP vs Fencing or MMA vs WCW:  Have you built a deck that seeks to fight the fight, or end the fight?  As an avowed casual, I build decks that do lots and lots of things, but none of those things end the game on their own.  The idea of including cards that, if cast mean the game is over and I win, is repulsive to me and feels like cheating.  The idea of beating someone at a resource battle because I can counter/answer more mana-efficiently than they can cast threats is boring to me.  I want a game of magic that plays more like a game of Risk than a game of Poker: where the win isn't determined by what cards I hold, but instead it's determined by how I choose to use what I have on the board."
EDH,3e0dnr,SpyglassSuperior,8,Tue Jul 21 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"Have you built a deck that seeks to fight the fight, or end the fight?   I like this. I think it's a more apt analogy."
EDH,3e0dnr,Tezzerator,4,Tue Jul 21 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of inbetween both camps. When I build a deck I build it as best as a I possibly can according to my subjective view of 'best' as far as my deck's strategy goes. That being, any one of my EDH decks usually runs up to about $500+ in total value and definitely erring far on the side of synergistic goodstuff with carefully balanced mana distribution, ratios, curves, and minimal 'jank'. All of my decks are at a spot I'd call '85-95%' in terms of power - a place where they are not designed to win fast (For example, mana crypt/mana vault and some other forms of fast mana acceleration are lacking because A: they're expensive and B: I could play more fun cards instead and still move forward as quickly as your average 75% deck) but they are definitely designed to try to win the long game. If my deck isn't as perfected as possible (without costing $750-$1000+) I would feel like I'm holding back my skills as a player, wherein the strongest point of my skill is in the deckbuilding. To a degree, the high power of my decks is there to make up for my many, many misplays by being designed flexible, efficient, and able to bounce back quickly. In the end, I play for the 'chess' side of the game and also for the social side. Honestly, I don't even care if I win a game as long as it felt like I had a chance and interacted a lot. If my deck made interesting things happen and still allowed my opponents to have fun then that in itself is a success. If I won in the process? Bonus."
EDH,3e0dnr,arcesious,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think I do the exact same thing as you. I remember when I built Crosis it had 3 combos in it. It now has none, is half the cost, an does a sweet toolbox win.   Winning is awesome as hell, but as long as I was in the game for most of it and my deck did it's thing, I'm happy."
EDH,3e0dnr,arcesious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"Well I don't shy away from 'quick combos' though. I'll totally run simple two-card wincons in a deck if those cards have synergy with everything else to serve more purposes than just comboing out. My Riku of Two Reflections and Sharuum the Hegemon decks for example? Infinites, infinites everywhere. Backed up by helpful toolboxes. But those combos definitely aren't happening before turn 5 or 6 and I'd rather the game end around turn 8-12 anyway."
EDH,3e0dnr,Ilnez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, price is highly relative. Duals are insanely expensive now, so my Karador deck is likely around 600$ before duals but it's over 1200$ after, just from the inclusion of three cards. My Derevi is ever worse, going from 250 ish to well over a thousand. Price is a really bad scale, ABU's don't add much power but they add a shit load of price."
EDH,3e0dnr,arcesious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"My decks run on usually 15 basic lands minimum, and as far duals go... I don't run the old super pricy duals. In a three color deck I'll run Command Tower, Reflecting Pool, 3x pain lands, 3x shocklands, 3x checklands, 3x filter lands, probably a reliquary tower, ancient tomb, and temple of the false god, with the rest mostly basics. Other mana fixing will be in the form of rocks (signets, talismans, chromatic lantern if needed) and/or green land tutoring spells. I specially don't run fetches or old duals because my wallet only goes so far and I've never felt any ill effects from not having my deck pimped out that far. In fact, running so many basics has actually been beneficial in some situations where an opposing deck punishes use of nonbasic lands."

Every time the two are mixed, much salt is created.     I'm very much a ""D&D"" guy. The ""chess"" guys tend to win. Not 100% of the time, but often enough. I have decided not to be salty with them. It's hard to tell someone they can't play their deck. So I am constantly tuning my decks to add answers or to speed them up. This is a deckbuilder's format. The STAX guy wins every time? Optimize your deck to beat him. If you play them enough times, you should notice what cards they use to win or set up their win."

EDH,3e0dnr,doug4130,7,Tue Jul 21 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry for commenting on my own post but a quick sidenote: this spectrum helps to explain the commonly ""unfun"" strategies. When Chess playing Charlie shows up with his Lockdown, MLD, Infinite Turn deck, not only is Charlie practically playing with himself, guess what the story is going to be for the D&D players? ""Well, we wanted to play magic but the game really stopped for us in the early turns. We watched Charlie blow up our stuff than sit there and take turns for 15 minutes."" It's the equivalent of everyone's characters rolling 1's the whole campaign."
EDH,3e0dnr,GeneralBobby,9,Tue Jul 21 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"I hate these analogies.  Do you really run no disruption to stop ""chess playing charlie"" from doing all this?  Is everyone oblivious to what he's doing?  Or is this how you perceive every deck played with a desire to win (which is the end goal of every magic game).  That doesn't mean that having fun and wanting to win are mutually exclusive either.  If a player is staving off disruption from all sides and manages to assemble a combo, they deserved the win.  Maybe it was just in their cards, maybe one of their opponents misplayed.  It won't happen every time, but be a good sport and gg whoever wins however they do it and play another game.    What you're describing isn't like characters rolling 1's the whole campaign, it's characters rolling only 1d6's when they have the option of rolling 2d6's"
EDH,3e0dnr,hippomancy,5,Tue Jul 21 02:14:32 2015 UTC,This has gradually become the way I think. The combo player isn't going away. Being angry accomplishes nothing. The only other options are to do nothing and lose every game by turn 5 or pay attention to how they win and tune my deck accordingly.
EDH,3e0dnr,R_V_Z,5,Tue Jul 21 11:21:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree in running disruption and I think in most cases you're correct, the player won't do that same thing every time. I'm more speaking towards when there is a displacement in the group and everyone is playing on different levels. Like the amount of mismatched expectations causes a person to post things like the post I saw earlier today."
EDH,3e0dnr,R_V_Z,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"I like this analogy.  If you're a competitive player, think of the D&D equivalent of what your deck does: you are rolling great and making lots of decisions while the rest of your party is unconscious in the background.  If you're a casual player, think of the chess equivalent of what your deck does: you're developing your pieces badly and leaving yourself with very few options in hopes of going after some clever strategy that you think is cool.  Obviously both of these are against the ""spirit of D&D"" and ""spirit of chess"" respectively, so figure out where the ""spirit of EDH"" falls along the continuum."
EDH,3e0dnr,Zrifts,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"If somebody said that to me (and they have) do you know what my immediate response would be (and it has)?  ""Why didn't you scoop?""  When you can no longer play the game why stay in the game? Instead of sitting there being miserable for what feels like an eternity realize that you have effectively lost that game, scoop it up and then hold a discussion before starting the next one. Explain that you feel there is a power disparity and offer solutions.  I've found myself being in a misjudged power disparity before and I told my opponent I could go for a quick win or we could stop the game and I'd play a different deck. If somebody on the winning side of that equation can initiate that discussion surely those who are being overpowered can initiate it as well."
EDH,3e0dnr,bac5665,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:38 2015 UTC,"Why would you want to play a deck that made someone feel miserable? (I'm not being a dick, it's a genuine question)"
EDH,3e0dnr,R_V_Z,4,Tue Jul 21 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"I'm playing Magic in a competitive style (not a competitive setting). When people build sixty-card decks they don't build them with the emotional state of their opponent in mind, and that applies to competitive EDH as well.  If I blow up all the lands and have a board lock it is up to my opponent(s) to realize that the game is over. It is only when they don't that misery will set in. I make the attempt before starting a session to get on the same page as other people power-level-wise, so whatever happens in the game is ""fair game."" It is only the odd occurrence when there is a disparity in power.  Competitive players don't feel miserable in those situations. We know when to scoop up and start a new game. It is always the uncompetitive players who either are trying out the more competitive side or stumbled into it without realizing who get bummed about stax-locks, uninteractive combo and the level of disruption that battlecruiser EDH generally lacks. Essentially newer or less competitive players have a hard time of recognizing when they have lost the game because it doesn't happen when their life-total becomes zero, or they mill out. It happens long before that. Unfortunately for them a lot of top-tier control decks take a while to ""officially"" end the game so they try to stick around to the bitter end.  At the end of the day if you aren't having fun you are free to find ways to fix that. Sometimes it is a discussion with your opponent(s), sometimes it is just a table away with three other people. Make it a goal to play with people who have the same level of competitiveness as you and everything else (except for personalities, which is more for the psychologists) will generally fall into place."
EDH,3e0dnr,Zrifts,6,Tue Jul 21 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"One commone misconception is that competitive games aren't interactive.  This is really just a joke.  If a combo isn't interacted with, you lose on the spot, so everyone tends to play more disruption.  When I play casual games, it is often painful to see how few answers people run."
EDH,3e0dnr,svanxx,4,Tue Jul 21 11:23:35 2015 UTC,"Which is ironic, because the casual players are all off doing their own linear thing, just with lots of creatures, but they complain when someone has a linear deck that's actually tuned."
EDH,3e0dnr,WirtsWoodenLeg,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"Very true. Competitive players would never play a deck that can't answer a creature at instant speed or any permanent at sorcery speed, at bare minimum. I think competitive setting lead to more interactive games than any battlecruiser game ever will. Let's see a battlecruiser game activate a Survival of the Fittest simply to Misdirect a Voidslime onto it. I've done that and it felt way cooler than swinging with generic big green creature #12."
EDH,3e0dnr,djauralsects,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"Not to rip on casual play.  I just think that the cliche that competitive play is uninteractive is completely wrong.  I tend to play with people who are somewhere in between but tend closer to competitive.  We like strong decks and don't mind combos, but something like Boonweaver Giant combo seems a bit lame to me to be honest."
EDH,3e0dnr,svanxx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"This is very true. I feel like I'm the only one stopping the other powerful decks from slaughtering us all, while our casual players are sitting around putting out another creature that does nothing for them."
EDH,3e0dnr,await,3,Tue Jul 21 16:10:33 2015 UTC,"This is quite literally why I play with:  a) a group, because my deck is not tuned great for multiplay and politics usually wins. Which sometimes your on the good side of politics, sometimes the other.  b) my best friend, we built our decks together, found the flavour we love and can play 10+ fun games a night because we know each others decks so well that when he gets his turn 3 Ulamog, if I don't have the answer in my hand or top deck, I will gladly scoop and play another.  In both of these scenarios though we play in a way where if you are able to finish your opponent(s), then you do it. No one in my playgroup cares if you Genesis Wave for 20, if all you had to do was swing with 100s of infect elves. We see it as wasting time. Playing 4 games and having a good time is always preferred over one 4 hour game (usually because someone is locked out for half that time umtil someone else helps them, then it changes)."
EDH,3e0dnr,svanxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"I don't play decks with the intention of making my opponents miserable, I play those decks because they are immensely enjoyable to pilot. Your misery has nothing to do with me, that's something you have created yourself. There are plenty of mature adults who thoroughly finely tuned competitive decks.

EDH,3e0dnr,Noahsucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"I've learned now to scoop if we are going to be locked out. Usually you find that when one person is ready to scoop, so is everyone else.  Now, if the person says they are about to combo off and it won't take too long, I'll wait for that. But if they don't have a win condition and it's going to take a while, then it's time to scoop and play a new game."
EDH,3e0dnr,WirtsWoodenLeg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:52 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a complete lack of creativity in story telling to me.  D&D isn't the care-free cake walk that you make it out to be. You are adventuring and likely living under constant threat of death and dismemberment. What do you do when you and a few people get thrown into a pit with a giant troll? You team up. And if you play EDH like you do D&D, you should team up. Create a narrative where big bad Derevi is the giant troll. Band together, strategize and take that player down.  Just like you would in D&D."

EDH,3e0dnr,slickback322,4,Tue Jul 21 16:05:54 2015 UTC,Clearly you never played 3.5. Power gamers... Power gamers everywhere...  And honestly if your deck is tuned even 50% you should have no problem with this kind of player. In my experience its the power gamer that gets salty when thier azami deck is shut down every game by decks runnimg guildgates and sub optimal cards. Step up to the plate put that pallaka wyrm back in the uncommons where it belongs and pick a card that has some power behind it. People who cry about the power level of other decks are the cancer that makes people turn thier nose up at this format. The problem is with the weaker decks not the stronger ones. Tldr: making a new scale won't magically make the way you built your deck any more playable.
EDH,3e0dnr,jaywinner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:03:11 2015 UTC,"It just always seemed a little weird to me that in Standard people make decks to win. In modern, same thing. Legacy and Vintage follow suit. But EDH it seems expected that you have accomodate people into the format.  Some in my playgroup complain about Iona, being unfun. I always say to them, ""find the answer."" There is always an answer. Iona is a heavy W creature, play some land hate againt W and you probably won't see her as often. If your trouble is being infinite combo'd, play more disruption.  I don't think people realize that we are all asking the same thing from each other just in differnt terms. Competative players are asking you to revamp and build some answers. Social players are asking you to revamp and lose some questions."
EDH,3e0dnr,Kerrus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I enjoy playing both sides of the spectrum and everywhere in between. When I build a deck I set a goal for it. To be competitive or to be simply competent. In a competitive deck I look for the most cutthroat efficiency. In a competent deck I like to play the game and put up a fight worth talking about, but winning isn't always expected. And I ALWAYS check with my play group and my local LGS what style of play people want to have to have. This way I'm not whipping out Zur when folks wanna play a more relaxed game, and I'm pulling out Uril or Thromok."
EDH,3e0dnr,tobyelliott,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the distinction that the ""chess"" player is antithetical to the ""d&d"" player is very fair in describing what experiences people seek in playing the format. EDH is just as fun if players are both trying to win AND be social at the same time, like, there's no dramatic tension if everyone isn't competing. Every game does not have to be a 4-hour, un-optimized slogfest."
EDH,3e0dnr,MinervaMedica000,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:57 2015 UTC,"As a competitive player, I have trouble understanding the D&D perspective.   My vision of a game of D&D is a DM that isn't trying to defeat the party, he's trying to give them a fair challenge to overcome, hopefully making for an interesting story for all involved.  In EDH, you are all competing for victory. What makes the format ""casual"" is having to make a 100 card singleton deck with a healthy ban list. This prevents every game from looking the same like Elf->Fires of Yavimaya->Blastoderm->Saproling burst."

They're more an extension of myself than a random pile of 100 cards.   And while I pride my skill, I still don't want to be the guy KO'ing all your lands to win. There are things I just don't want to do in the game, but I know it will make things better. Alternatively, I have a player in my group who is highly skilled and doesn't mind doing the dirty stuff and acknowledges after that it wasn't a feel-good situation.

EDH,3e3o3b,CharlesSneerbite,2,Tue Jul 21 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"FYI you are outright incorrect in regards to Howling Mine. Howling Mine triggers in Draw Step, not upkeep, so Paradox haze does nothing here.  As a competitive player I know how ""goodwill"" can lead to beneficial politics. The problem is that in competitive settings doing such a thing is suicidal. Any amount of goodwill I can gain is not worth giving my opponents extra cards in a competitive setting. From the competitive mindset having a Howling Mine out means that you are two-for-oneing yourself every turn (your additional card cancels out one opponent, and then two more opponents draw)."

Competitive play and multiplayer in EDH aren't necessarily mutually exclusive and of course every player develops their own style---it's simply that in a thunderdome situation (with my playgroup at least) some amount of goodwill can save your game. That all being said, Howling mine isn't the greatest example of card-advantage-leverage and is more accurately a 'group hug' card. As such, I've removed HM from my list to make it more accurate. @T3pwnographer: I also owe you a debt of gratitude for catching my slip with the bauble. It's my first article in some time, so I appreciate you guys catching my errors."

EDH,3e0dkz,SleetTheFox,10,Tue Jul 21 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, this is broken. I can just literally play 0 lands with that rule. 2 is all I need in a proper combo deck."

EDH,3e0dkz,SleetTheFox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:26 2015 UTC,Man I would never go that low in a Kruphix deck. There's no such thing as mana flood when you have the god of horizons on your side!
EDH,3e0dkz,atr0s,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:11 2015 UTC,"Haha, I normally wouldn't either. But I was making the deck at midnight the night before I wanted to play it just from my collection to take a break from my good deck for a bit.

This could only be done either once or three times per game, I don't remember. I also think it could only be basic land. We never tried it though before we all went our separate ways."
EDH,3e0dkz,Tezzerator,3,Tue Jul 21 05:03:52 2015 UTC,This looked like a good idea until I realized I would never need to play more than 20 lands in anything ever again.  Then it looked like a GREAT idea.
EDH,3e0dkz,SeeOtter,3,Tue Jul 21 05:08:44 2015 UTC,That rule sounds very abusable....
EDH,3e0dkz,Dutchling,7,Tue Jul 21 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"Ohh, I'd love that in Edric. I'd only ever need to hit one land to get going. Could probably cut down to 15 lands or so.  I mean, I'd have to cut a few of the more expensive (cmc 4+) spells since I'll be hitting my fourth land drop a little later then expected, but getting away with so few lands in the deck more than makes up for that, as it would solve the ""draw 10 cards but only hit 1cmc dudes and lands"" issue."
EDH,3e0dkz,Tezzerator,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Pfft. With the amount of mana dorks Edric runs, you wouldn't need to keep lands in your opener ever."
EDH,3e0dkz,Dutchling,3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:26 2015 UTC,"You need double blue though, since most of the evasive dudes are 1 blue mana, and if you start with 2 islands in exile you cant cast mana dorks!"
EDH,3e0dkz,Tezzerator,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"You need one blue and one green, really, regardless of what you draw into - it would be nice to have more, but the green is required for T1 dork and the blue is required for literally everything else the deck does. I could see a case for double blue, but I think having blue green would be just better."
EDH,3e0dkz,Dutchling,2,Tue Jul 21 05:19:47 2015 UTC,I mean that the deck will just be way too slow if you can cast only one evasive creature per turn. It means you kinda scoop against blockers.  Especially if everyone abuses the new rules and gets super quick decks too :P
EDH,3e0dkz,BrianWantsTruth,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:55 2015 UTC,"I really like this. I think if I were to propose this to my group (which I will), I would say that they're exiled if you control, say, 6 or more lands. No shenanigans, just legitimate on-schedule assurance."
EDH,3e0dkz,Tezzerator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"...so I would be shot back down to turn 4 when I hit six mana? I dunno, seems like there has to be a more fluid solution."
EDH,3e0dkz,Super_Satchel,2,Tue Jul 21 05:07:25 2015 UTC,I think they meant six lands in play and 1 or two of the commander lands still unplayed. The unplayed ones would be exiled. Just a guess though.
EDH,3e0dkz,BrianWantsTruth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:26:36 2015 UTC,"Nono, they get exiled from the command zone if you haven't used them by then."
EDH,3e0dkz,MinervaMedica000,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:33 2015 UTC,Problem is the people already are abusing the good nature of the rule (looking at the comments).  I like it but in my meta we just reveal our partial mulligan (no penalty) and if everyone agrees draw till your hands in seven. Repeat until you get enough lands (revealing each time) for approval.   This stops combo players from abusing the rule like oh can I keep these 3 tutors and mulligan for lands...... nope shuffle ALL that back.   Our group is not that competitive but people still play to win

I also know that many people don't have mana issues when they shuffle correctly, so a lot of my time has been spent ensuring i have at least 38 land and that my shuffling maximizes randomness."
EDH,3e0dkz,SpyglassSuperior,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:06:23 2015 UTC,ITT: people who don't get EDH telling how they'd break this.  This rule is fantastic and designed for casual play in a casual format. If you'd take a rule made to ensure games are always playable and fun and turn it into a way to combo out t3 every time-- you're in the wrong format.

EDH,3dzhm1,JuicyToaster,22,Mon Jul 20 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"stax or STAKS ($T4KS) the word stands for ""The $4K Solution""  It was a vintage deck that denied the opponent resources with Sphere of Resistance and Tangle Wire, and played a ridiculously expensive mana base and practically the entire restricted list.  Now it refers to any deck that attempts to lock out the opponents' resources through sacrifice, tapping, or making their spells cost too much to cast  Prime examples of stax cards are: Smokestack, Winter Orb, Nether Void, Raven's Crime and Strip Mine.  These 5 cards embody the different plans of attack Stax can manage- ""even"" sacrifice, ""even"" tapping, ""even"" spell cost increase, ""even"" discard, and ""even"" destruction.  Your plan as a Stax player is to unbalance as many of these ""even"" ratios as you can, gaining small elements of value every turn until your opponents have nothing and you have something (anything, really)."

Generally the best star colors are (brown) white black and blue. The best star generals are grand arbiter Augustine and teysia (original ravnica). Usually the grand arbiter decks just play a bunch of mana rocks so their amegedons are one sided, then the general himself dogs everyone into a deeper hole while digging them out. Teysia makes a bunch of tokens, generally plays a sac for value kind of theme, and can play some easy low curve combos and tutors for said combos."

EDH,3e0shf,MTGCardFetcher,4,Tue Jul 21 02:26:31 2015 UTC,Putting Ashnod's Altar(which is begging for something to combo with it) in Ghave(who combos with almost anything) is a good way to make a combo deck.

EDH,3dzsfo,OliverDeBurrows,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Be prepared to order cards because 3 sets is a really small card pool for EDH. Your best options are one of the FRF Khans not named Tasigur, GB Elves (Rhys the Exiled or Nath of the Gilt-Leaf) or Kothophed-kill-your-stuff. Look for deck techs or ask me specifically about one of these options for more info and maybe a draft build.   Even if you build around recent sets, you're still going to end up ordering a ton of stuff online or hunting for singles. There are a lot of cards, usually cheap, that you're going to want to run, and those three sets alone probably don't contain enough good/useful/on-theme cards to make a deck out of.   Budget is a consideration; I don't know your exact situation, but it sounds like you want to keep things cheap. I won't list off expensive cards from those three sets; the most generally useful EDH ones are Den Protector and Sword of the Animist, so throw them in if you have them. Only the sword is really worth going out of your way for.  You probably don't want to run a monocolor deck, since they'll require you to dig deep into the color and end up with a bunch of cards that are either bad or expensive. Go 2- or 3-color. 3-color's mana base is going to be a little tougher but it's manageable, especially if one of those colors is green. Catch-all solutions for mana fixing are ravnica signets, Darksteel Ingot, Commander's Sphere, Terramorphic Expanse, Evolving Wilds, the KTK banners and tri-lands, and general green ramp spells.  Whatever your commander is, you'll want to protect it. The standard for this is Swiftfoot Boots, and sometimes Mask of Avacyn and/or Whispersilk Cloak if your commander draws a lot of attention or you rely on it a lot.   The legendary dragons from FRF aren't the greatest commanders. They all encourage you to have multiple dragons to get the most out of the effect, but that takes a lot of work. Red gets dragons, Blue gets Xenograft, and Black gets Conspiracy but for the most part you should only be expecting to get the effect once per turn. Atarka can just swing for a ton under those conditions and Dromoka's passable but the other dragons don't really do enough for how much they cost. Both Atarka and Dromoka are better off in the 99.   The FRF Khans are generally pretty good. Don't build Tasigur; he requires a variety of counters and kill spells, especially ones with upside as a way to get ahead, and he's expensive himself.   Alesha wants a bunch of 2-power creatures with interesting effects, but those tend to be scattered across many sets because high-cost creatures with low power is usually a bad thing. This winds up making Alesha kind of tough to build off 3 sets, though Elite Scaleguard, Dragonscale General, Nantuko Husk, and Priest of the Blood Rite are good and on-theme. The way the deck usually plays is that it get stuff into the graveyard (Buried Alive, Bitter Revelation), brings it back for an effect on ETB or death, and then sacrifices it to repeat the process. Flameshadow Conjuring fits right in too.   Daghatar is a +1/+1 counter general. Use the outlast creatures from KTK, every good source of bolster (including Dromoka, the Eternal) and anything that lets you put lots of +1/+1 counters on things. Fertilid and Solidarity of Heroes are cards from other sets that are very much worth looking at. He's probably the easiest to build because +1/+1 counters show up in almost every set.   Yasova is a theft theme. Might Makes Right from M15 is worth getting a hold of. You generally want to make Yasova big and protected; Hero's Blade and +1/+1 counter cards can help you here. Then steal people's creatures and swing, or use effects like Fling, Jalira, Master Polymorphist, and Djinn of Infinite Deceits (from Commander 2013) so you don't actually have to return them. If you can get your hands on repeatable sacrifice outlets like Ashnod's Altar or Evolutionary Leap, those are great in the deck and combo with cards like Mob Rule and Molten Primordial.   Shu Yun wants to become big and hard to block before swinging for a ton. You want cheap equipment like Bonesplitter and Hero's Blade, and maybe even enchantments. The runemarks aren't very good, but Sage's Reverie is fine, the Ordeals from Theros are fine, and Helm of the Gods isn't a completely awful card. Then play a bunch of cheap instants (Cantrips are nice), some rebound spells (look at the ones from Zendikar too) and cards that care about noncreature spells (Strongarm Monk and Soulblade Djinn come to mind)   From DTK, the dragons aren't worth using as commander. Kolaghan won't trigger, Atarka and Silumgar need to be taken off the field if you want to reuse their effects, and Dromoka just sits there. Ojutai is good (put together a bunch of ways to give him vigilance) but costs enough that if you don't already have one it's not worth buying one just to make him the commander.   The DTK ex-khans aren't very good either. Sidisi, Anafenza, and Surrak are good cards, but they're better suited to be part of the deck than as commanders.   The Magic Origins planeswalkers cost too much to try making commander, and they aren't great in that spot either. As for the other legends, Alhammarret is bad, Hixus is a one-shot effect, and Pia and Kiran are alright but you'll wish they had blue in them.   Kothophed can be really strong because he turns all your removal into draw spells. Random ""sacrifice a creature"" effects like Fleshbag Marauder and Merciless Executioner are good, but you'll wish you had ways to make people lose things other than creatures. Smallpox and Death Cloud are best for that as long as you have some zombie tokens around. Spiteful Blow is good despite costing 6 mana. Ghost Quarter, Tectonic Edge, and Encroaching Wastes hit lands and let you draw. Use artifacts like Argentum Armor, Eye of Doom, Nevinyrral's Disk, and Spine of Ish Sah to blow up other stuff.   Dwynen isn't bad but there are better options. The couple of black elves are good enough that you'll want to branch out into black with a general like Rhys the Exiled (combos with Sanguine Bond) or Nath of the Gilt-Leaf. That said, Elves are everywhere except Khans block and are generally easy to build. If you got the green EDH precon, that's a really good starting point."

EDH,3dzsfo,FlyingRep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, if you look at the TCGplayer entry for Animar, they show his median price being over $3 since March 2013, or much closer to 2.5 years. It underwent a significant spike to >10 in Feb/March 2014, maybe around when , and then rose again in Feb/March of this year to >20, closer to when TL was more popular. I don't think that Tiny Leaders had that much of an impact on the card. I think it's just an in-demand commander that was printed 4 years ago now and hasn't been reprinted."

[[Longshot Squad]] is probably going to get cut for [[Corpsejack Menace]] but outside of that I will run all of the Outlast +1/+1 enabler creatures. Another card I highly recommend for +1/+1 counters is [[Spiritmonger]] which happens to be pretty cheap nowadays thanks to the MM2 reprint.

[[Face to Face]] in an UN card and not legal.  [[Lightning bolt]] and [[raise the alarm]] are too small for this format.  you need more artifact and enchantment hate, its one of the reasons I suggest anyone (but especially newer players) always play either green or white in their decks because artifacts and enchantments get out of control REALLY fast. [[Return to dust]] [[austere command]] [[Aura of Silence]] and [[Wear//Tear]] are all excellent options in your colors."

My point being: you play every different commander at different times to do different things, they play differently. I see how a deck's commander stands in relation to its strategy as part of the identity of that deck, and the planeswalker commanders all feel somewhat similar.   Find a way to protect your planeswalker or get hime hated out after being able to use one of his abilities. If you can get him out, use his abilities to some sort of advantage, like sorceries and instants on a stick.   I am sure people like them, and I do not begrudge anyone for it, of course, that would be stupid, but in my experienc playing with them, the planeswalkers did not feel as satisfying or stick around long enough if you didn't follow the pattern of building up protection for them and then playing them, which they will all require, barring some extraordinary plus ability that gives a planeswalker plus loyalty and protection from whatever, which would likely bust the ever-loving shit out of legacy or something similar or require that his other abilities are garbage.

EDH,3dybfb,SpyglassSuperior,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see more. I've greatly enjoyed the ones we do have, and I think they add a dynamic to the game that's very enjoyable.  As to making all of the currently existing ones legal as commanders... The only one that might be problematic is Tezzeret the Seeker, while the rest are shoe-ins, and as to Tezzeret, we already have Arcum. I think the damage to the format would be minimal, and easily fixed by the reintroduction of the ""banned as commander"" list if Tezz really became a problem, while the net gain would be unmeasurably high."
EDH,3dybfb,bronzebicker,7,Tue Jul 21 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"To preface this, I realize I'm biased against walkers because I don't like what they do to gameplay.  They effectively act as an extra player in the game with a limited life total and spell set, since they don't require further resource commitment from their caster to generate a wide variety of effects, and they require opponents to redirect their attacks away from the caster to take the PWs out.  The fact that they functionally add an extra player to the game without any ability to politically influence this player means one of the big draws of EDH (table politics) is easily circumvented by spending the money to buy other players that you can put into play on your team.    Now, that said, I do have a mechanical qualm against them as commanders as well.  Planeswalkers should not be available in the indefinitely-re-castable command slot until we have a way to interact with emblems.  The ability to  Use a planeswalker like Teferi   Get just enough loyalty to ult him for his emblem  Send him back to the command zone  Re-cast him immediately   Use him again  Then continue to use him during opponents' turns because of the emblem (still in place) is a pretty good argument to me that PWs don't belong in the command slot."
EDH,3dybfb,SpyglassSuperior,11,Mon Jul 20 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Emblem abilities are quite difficult to pull off though (I know, Sorin, Doubling Season). The way the 2014 walkermanders are made, it's a fair enough trade off for no commander damage.  Their addition to the board is much like a modal enchantment, actually. Easier to remove than enchantments too. Much like other permanents in Magic, generates more value the longer it stays. There are definitely impactful and expensive walkers out there that feel like another player (JTMS, Karn, Ugin), but even then I wouldn't call them uninfluenceable. In fact, convincing the player to choose the wrong ability/target is an EDH achievement"
EDH,3dybfb,bronzebicker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"You're definitely right that you have a limited degree of influence over the walker, in that they have to respond to the board and threats, but they're not really open to politics; nothing can ever make them turn on their caster.    For that reason, they always feel like a mindslavered mini-player in the game: they can go after ALMOST anyone in the game, but they will always be acting in one player's interest and following his/her orders.  That player can make mistakes, but they never have to worry about the walker having their own agenda.    When the permanent in question is a creature, this obedience makes more sense.  When the permanent in question requires opponents treat it like another player, obedience is less reasonable."

He feels like a control player, because even if he doesn't have a board presence, if you let him amass resources long enough he can basically shut you out of the game."

Sure, sometimes I will leave it there as removal bait, but most of the times, I don't care to minus it to death. In that regard, it's only a powerful resource."
EDH,3dybfb,SpyglassSuperior,7,Tue Jul 21 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you a little bit about planeswalkers in the game.   Calling them an extra player doesn't accurately reflect what they do -- they can't react, they can't do things at instant speed (Teferi PW emblem being the lone exception), they can't gameplan. They aren't AI. If I want to, I can ignore them. It's perhaps foolish, but I can.  Mechanically, planeswalkers have a lot more in common with a TF2 turret than I do. A big, powerful, annoying thing that acts as both threat and decoy, and takes some effort to build into a game-changing effect. And turrets can be solved (eg. Spies, Vampire Hexmage), it just takes a similar level of effort.  That being said, though, I do agree with you on two points: walkermanders shouldn't have emblems, and we as players should have a way to interact with emblems. Give me something like this...    Winds of the Blind Eternities 13C Sorcery - [M]  ~ cannot be countered.  Exile all creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers. All players lose all emblems.    ... with a little bit of new language in the CR as to how ""losing"" applies to emblems and differs from ""destroying"", ""exiling"", and ""sacrificing"", and I'll be happy."
EDH,3dybfb,Radiophage,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"Can you explain where the lack of AI and gameplanning factors in?  In my experience, that has been less of an equalizing factor, and more of an imbalancing factor: they don't have their own plans and goals-- they are players that are complete lackeys to their caster.  While they can only act at sorcery speed, they act as a lower-lifed player with only sorcery speed spells that has been perpetually mindslavered by their caster."
EDH,3dybfb,SpyglassSuperior,4,Mon Jul 20 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'll use Spine of Ish Sah as an example.  When I'm considering how to deal with an enemy player, I have to evaluate my whole gameplan -- not only the cards in my deck, but also my ability to politic and play the player on top of playing the game. I have to choose a package of cards that answers a broad variety of possible threats, and consider many possible lines of play, each with their own level of interactivity and to which the other player can respond. And then I have to consider my ability to respond to their responses, and on and on and on.  A resolved Spine of Ish Sah does not solve an enemy player.  When I'm considering how to deal with an enemy planeswalker, I can dedicate a subset of my control package to cards that deal with planeswalkers. I can then play a card that deals with a planeswalker, and the planeswalker doesn't do a damn thing -- it's a drone, a dummy, a tool. It's the enemy player that has some choices to make. They will have to spend resources to protect their tactic, instead of implement it, but resources they will spend, or they will lose it.   A resolved Spine of Ish Sah solves an enemy planeswalker.  Planeswalkers die to removal. As simple as it sounds, they die to removal. As such, they're just one more thing I have to pack answers to -- no different from, say, the Siege cycle of enchantments, which are also modal permanents with a once-per-turn effect.   (I actually find enchantments and artifacts more annoying, since they have one less layer of interactivity -- I can't attack them. Every creature ever printed is partially an answer to a planeswalker, whereas that Palace Siege is staying there until I draw into one of a much smaller subset of cards.)  Now, all that being said: I agree that emblems are problematic -- everything should have an answer, and currently emblems do not. I also agree that a properly-balanced planeswalker commander won't have an emblem ult -- as a result, Freyalise is much closer to being an ideal walkermander than the other four are, IMO. (And coincidentally, she's often thought to be weakest. Hmm.)  But planeswalkers themselves? They're fine, IMO. Just one more thing to pack answers for.  EDIT> clarity"
EDH,3dybfb,MTGCardFetcher,3,Mon Jul 20 18:38:46 2015 UTC,"One of the issues I have with answers and walkers is that walkers are relatively new, so answers to them are pretty limited.  Lots of true boardwipes (ex: jokulhaups, obliterate, Nev's disk--being older cards) will leave walkers untouched, as they would a player.  There is an abundance of kill spells that hit creatures, but relatively few that hit walkers.    Burn spells are a nice way to deal with them, and attacking is as well, but this makes them much more similar to a player than a creature in that they have a life total you need to knock down.  In this regard, many function very much like a player in their ability to protect themselves from your attack: lots of them can summon creatures to block you from attacking them, just like a player would.    At the end of the day though, you're right.  There are cards that you can play that straight-up destroy a planeswalker.  The difference to me is that, because walkers are newer, their answers are much more difficult to come by.  [[terror]] is a 10c common, while [[Hero's Downfall]] is a $2.50 rare.  Once walker answers become more ubiquitous, I'll probably be more ok with them."

EDH,3dybfb,Radiophage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I dont think an emblem ult is ridiculous on a walker.  Now if you made sorin lord of innistrad a commander, that would get frustrating, since he doesnt have to work for his emblem. But if a walker has a powerful ult emblem, and all the other players either let it get to that point, or are powerless to prevent it, then that player is probably going to or should win.  Inyerestingly I think freyalise was probably intentionally weaker. Green has doubling season, so they needed to balance the mono green commandwalker around that fact."
EDH,3dybfb,earthDF,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:50 2015 UTC,"Not ridiculous, no. But I think it's kind of ridiculous that emblems can't be interacted with in any way, and I do (eventually) want a removal spell for emblems.   (I'll leave aside the question of whether someone ""should"" win or not, as I always find that semantically difficult.)  I dunno about Doubling Season -- Teferi has the Chain Veil, Nahiri has SFM and all the other outstanding artifact/equipment support in white, etc. etc. I think the 2014 walkermanders were balanced against each other, and Freyalise was given that ult to shore up one of green's traditional weaknesses, card draw. Note also that it has by far the lowest cost of all the ults among them, so it's designed to be repeated relatively often."
EDH,3dybfb,CrazyEddie30,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:53 2015 UTC,Yeah. I mostly meant that with doubly season you could ult freyalise the turn she comes in. So she wasnt given an emblem because that can be a huge problem that wizards is very aware of.  And I actually like freyalise. She pilots the deck well enough and the card draw is amazing.

IMO Horde isn't worth building unless you get this card first and foremost. Don't worry too much about finding particularly good cards for it to cascade into, since getting a 3-for-1 is usually good enough. Similarly, [[Maelstrom Nexus]] is raw value, but it's up to you as to whether an easy-to-kill enchantment is worth it.   [[Baleful Force]], [[Hateflayer]], and [[Titania, Protector of Argoth]] are other strong and non-obvious (i.e. don't say Evoke on them) targets.  [[Flamekin Harbinger]] tutors for all those and more. [[Time of Need]] gets Wanderer and Titania.  [[Seething Pathblazer]] helps your elementals dodge exile.   [[Crib Swap]] is an Elemental, so you can recur it over and over again.   [[Ashes of the Fallen]] is good for the likely case you have some utility creature you'd like to replay.   Since Horde operates out of the graveyard, a lot of decks include a bit of dredge via [[Life from the Loam]] and sometimes [[Deadbridge Chant]].  You're going to want a ton of fixing. [[Chromatic Lantern]] and  [[Coalition Relic]] cost a bit but really get the job done. All the normal stuff (Darksteel Ingot and Commander's Sphere) are fine too.

First, [[Sensei's Divining Top]] is expensive, but it's 100% amazing. Pay 1 to look at top 3 and rearrange, then you can tap it to save it if someone tries to target it with a spell. Worth the $25.  I run a lot of counters, top-deck manipulation, and sorcery replication (Jeleva spells resolve to graveyard). The deck is weak without them. I tried avoiding tutoring and top deck manip at first, and the deck literally got shat on because you wwre casting her as a chance and defenseless.  Screw-you cards for multiplayer: [[Worst Fears]] [[Cruel Ultimatum]] [[Choice of Damnations]] can all be Jeleva casts.  Cards to replicate sorceries from graveyards: [[Volcanic Vision]] [[Spelltwine]] [[Sins of the Past]]  [[Mnemonic Wall]] and [[Twincast]] can be used while the spell is still on the stack  Destroy Creatures: [[Necromantic Selection]] gives you one back. [[Life's Finale]] is great esp if you know the opponents deck. [[Plague Wind]] doesn't affect your creatures.  Then if you use [[Rise of the Dark Realms]] you get ALL OF THEM. And if you use the creature [[Consuming Abberation]] the creature is that much more powerful.  Limiting Attacks on you: [[Crawlspace]] is amazing. [[No Mercy]] is amazing. [[Propoganda]] is a mana drain. [[Aetherspouts]] is an instant but you can replicate it with above cards. Good to mention that if opponent runs tokens, aetherspouts is great bc tokens dont survive in libraries or graveyards.  Get many creatures: [[Army of the Damned]] is an obvious choice. When [[Savage Beating]] is played, it's great because you get all of them untapped. May want to run [[Fervor]] if you want them to have haste. [[Clone Legion]] is great, esp if you can cast it and then cast a card from the next category.  Gain control of everything: [[Mob Rule]] can also be used after army of the damned. [[Insurrection]] is magnificent. Take everything and swing as hard as you can. This is particularly amazing after clone legion. [[Reins of Power]] is also good if you don't have many or any creatures out yet.  If you want to limit opponent creatures: [[Archfiend of Depravity]] and [[Killing Wave]] are a good way to cull the opponents creatures if you have little or none and there aren't any wipes logical or available.

EDH,3dyx5z,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"It's alright, but it'll probably die as a creature (and pull aggro because it'd help you), and I prefer the sorceries that allow you to replicate stuff from your graveyard without paying it's cost. If you can cast one of those with Jeleva, you'll never pay for it, and it can be as expensive as you want."

EDH,3dyx5z,Player4our,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"I've never really played Jeleva, so I honestly don't know the way to effectively build her.   I will say it may be a bit hard.  A strategy dependent on another players deck then devolves to completely depending on not only what that player has but also what that player has already used up.  That's why I like [[yasova dragonclaw]] as an insurrection general cause it doesn't matter if your opponents have already cast the creatures you want, but instead matter on making Yasova powerful enough to control them, then punish your opponent with things like [[fling]].  With Jeleva, it's a random assortment of things you may like or dislike. Plus being limited to instants and sorceries could be a hindrance in some match-ups.  If you wanted a personal opinion, I would switch the general to [[wrexial, the risen deep]].  You aren't using that much red to begin with, so dropping the color would make spells easier and make your mana base much smoother.  With Wrexial, you get basically the same effect as Jeleva, but you get the choice of the entire graveyard of the opponent.  You can definitely still focus on the stealing aspect, using cards like Thada Adel and Blatant thievery, and in fact I would encourage that.  That way it is easier for your creature to get into the red zone.  But if the deck is redone with a control-mill strategy in mind, then you also have a goal for the deck to go to, in case your facing an opponent whose instants and sorceries aren't the good to choose from.  If you wanted to stick with Jeleva, I would personally change the focus to more of your style: big spells.  Since you get free casts on your own things as well as your opponents, having some gigantic and game changing instants and sorceries drop down for no cost to you can be huge in multiplayer.  Just my two cents, but I hope this helps in any way!"

EDH,3dyx5z,thatsnotmylane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight! I think I may look a bit deeper into Wrexial. I've seen him sitting in a binder at my local shop but never really thought about building a control-mill deck around him. That could be lots of fun. I may even build both. Do you know of any big spells that I could use for Jeleva?
EDH,3dyx5z,thatsnotmylane,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think Jeleva would be a massive control deck if you were to build her.  Therefore we need spells that normal control decks really couldn't cast.  One such thing you could potentially go for is straight draw power, so casting something like [[enter the infinite]] for free, then dropping the remaining pieced of [[laboratory manic]] and two draws can win you the game.  Then again, other spells that can be cast would be things like [[insurrection]] which is flavorful to the build you have now.  Downside is you have already passed the attack step once this happens, but if you have something like [[goblin bombardment]], then you can effectively wipe a field and deal massive damage.  Other great spells for this would be [[in garruk's wake]] or [[plague wind]], or if you make Jeleva unblockable, things like [[virulent strike]] has potential to win the game for you.  Other obvious includes for more of a blue taste would be [[cyclonic rift]] for nasty permanents and [[sunder]] since you really won't need those lands later in the game.  I would say the best bet to do Jeleva right would be a voltron-control build.  have cards that can give you a significant advantage in and out of combat, make it so Jeleva has the opportunity to attack and cast something each turn she needs to, and have plenty of bounce effects so you can recast her.  So broken down, I would focus on: red for power and damage, black for removal and mild tokens, and blue for counters, disruption and draw.  This make it so Jeleva can still hit hard, making the voltron strategy viable, while you can cast things like [[army of the damned]] or [[grave titan]] to build a defense.  Using lands to cast Jeleva like [[hall of the bandit lord]] and other red spells or [[lightning greaves]], you can recast and attack with Jeleva on the same turn.  Blue then takes care of making combat easier, keeping opponents in check and making sure you have a steady stream of cards coming.  You also playing Grixis, so a mild discard theme could be implemented.  This is of course what I would do if I was build Jeleva.  She isn't quite good enough to last too terribly long in a drawn out game, so she needs to be quick, efficient and deadly. This also requires a whole lot of library manipulation.  Scry will be your best friend and cards like [[doomsday]] are fun and could be the final push to get the W in certain situations."

Broken: Use mystical tutor, long-term plans, personal tutor, vampiric tutor, and other such effects to put enter the infinite on top of your library when you cast your commander, who you'll give haste however you choose, then win like that.  Goofy: Play all the expensive instants and sorceries that don't win the game (warp world, scrableverse, etc) and a bunch of can trips, and rituals and maybe some storm cards and try to pretent you're a storm combo deck or whatever.

EDH,3dxpqg,Lagsterkun,7,Mon Jul 20 11:57:39 2015 UTC,"Do you play active or reactive decks ? Do you try to reach a middle ground ?   I have never been a fan of dedicated control.   I tend to build active decks that can interact with the game if need be.   Have you changed from one approach to another over the years ?   I would say so.  My first EDH deck was the Heavenly Inferno precon from back in the day.  I eventually modified it to slam fatties as quickly  as possible without giving a game as to what the rest of the table was doing.  Nowadays, I dedicate slots to answers fro common threats.   When you start building a deck, do you build around a card/theme, or against your current meta ? Do you try to squeeze in both ?   I always go for a theme or a certain type of card interaction.  If it's janky and unexpected, then I'll try it...even if it doesn't stand a chance of winning.  Sometimes I surprise myself.     Control?  No.  Reactive?  Of course.   While I don't like/play dedicated control, I do try to include removal and occasionally counters in my decks.   I will usually include ten or so different types of removal.   If I am playing blue I will include 6-10 counters, but they are typically used defensively to protect my board state/my win.    Do you value theme over covering your deck's natural weaknesses ? If so, would you compromise by inserting a Spine of Ish Sah whenever your deck just can't answer some things ?   The theme of my deck is what keeps me invested in it.   I play my more thematic decks over the ones that don't really have a theme.   My UB zombies deck goes so far as to include cards that, while might not be great, really touch on the zombie theme like [[brainbite]], [[Apetite for brains]], [[Victim of the night]],  [[Grisly Spectacle]], etc.   I have chosen spells that might not be efficient because of the name or artwork on the card.     Are you in any way bothered by two people playing the same general in the same game ?   No, in fact I enjoy it.  It's interesting to see what different people can do with the same general.   What's the best control-ish deck you've seen or built in EDH until now ?   A guy at my LGS has a Tasigur deck that is absolutely the worst to play against.  Recurring his counters/bounce.

EDH,3dxpqg,sebster123,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I try and play a variety. Overall, I lean towards aggressive decks; Xenagod, Shu Yun, Horobi, and Slivers all try and put threats on the table. Gwafa, the upcoming Tasigur, and to a certain extent also Slivers pack a fair few answers rather than threats. Depends on the deck more than time. I want a broad variety of options when I'm sitting down at the table. :) It's about 95% gameplan/theme, 5% meta choices for me. I play in a few different metas, so I find I need to be flexible and protect my gameplan rather than pack meta-specific answers to anything. Has to be built well, but yes. It's hard to stop myself from giggling when they're playing a nice, big spell right into the [[Plasm Capture]] in my hand, and I've got open mana/slivers with which to cast it. No real control-specific templates, though. I try to pack a few cards that cover weaknesses, but no more than two or three, and they've always got a ridiculous explanation for how they fit the theme. (""Well, you see, Xenagos was hitting some of the herb he got from the elves too hard, and had a vision of the Eldrazi. Yeah. That's why [[Not of This World]] is in the deck. Yeah."") A tiny Vorthos voice in me is annoyed, but that's it. I'd be more bothered if they weren't having fun. I've seen a few very, very well-built Azami control and OG Teferi stax builds, but I'll say they weren't very fun to play against. Probably the most fun to play against have been well-tuned and upgraded Teferi PW and Daretti decks, as they have such unique gameplans within their colours."

If we're just playing for fun, though, and my deck is built to stop you from doing the fun things...why am I even here?  Personally, if I'm building a deck for fun, I will almost always go with the cards I want before I'll go with the cards I need (thanks, /u/Tezzerator for teaching that sentiment).  This does mean that if someone plays Iona, I probably won't have the colorless removal to get rid of her.  The plus side if that happens, though, is that I've now learned who not to play with-- their goal is to stop me from playing magic against them, and I'm all too happy to comply."

He doesn't have any win con, other than making his commander plug each player for 21, 1 at a time, and it sometimes works, because none of us have a single card down. I mean, not a single card.

EDH,3dxpqg,Clay_Puppington,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"When i build decks, especially for multiplayer, I find there needs to be a balance of reaction and action.  It can lean towards one or the other.  The extremes being something like a Pillowfort deck [[Oloro]] or straight voltron [[Narset]].    At first while playing EDH my budget controlled most of my deckbuilding.  As time went on, and my collection grew, I could actually make choices about what to run.  My favorite deck (note: not most powerful) is actually [[Intet the Dreamer]].  It's REALLY satisfying when a deck's strategy works like you want it to.    When building a deck, I try to focus on synergies.  Karador works with creatures in the graveyard, so you should run a [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] instead of a [[Rampant Growth]].  They function the same, but the Elder helps keep Karador's cost down.  When it comes to Intet, she wants to play off the top of the library.  so running things like [[sensei's divining top]] and [[Scroll Rack]] let you take advantage of her abilities.  I find themes can come out of flex spots in a deck.  It's like baking a cake i guess? You need all the flower and eggs (Removal, draw, ramp, ect.) but you can make it taste however you want.  But the flavoring is the smallest component of the cake.  My Intet cake tastes like dragon, if you're wondering.    Reaction is literally what separates Magic from Hearthstone.  Even if you're running voltron, you need to protect the front runner.  It doesn't have to be a lot, but there should be a foundation.  Enough to cover your weaknesses.  This comes from playtesting.  It also fluctuates with the strategy and synergy of the deck.  Karador doesn't run too much spot removal.  6-ish nukes, a couple [[Grave Pact]] like effects and that's more than enough. Intet struggles with huge boards, mainly because i have trouble finding a balance of good mass removal vs counterspells.  Permission and removal should be used to check bullshit plays.  Stopping a combo on turn 15 isn't needed as much as it is on turn 6. TD;LR it differs per deck and the colors you're running.    Again, a base of common spells is more important (at least to me) than theme. (get the cake reference above).  Though, the deck's synergies will color your choices.  Ish-sah is a house in Sharuum, but not that great for a Rafiq Deck.  Again, I'll run a [[Necrotic sliver]] in Karador over a [[Vindicate]] any day because of the commander.   I try not to overlap commanders in a game? It's not like, the worst, but variety is the spice of life.  Intet is probably the best (I'm biased).  Run some topdeck manipulation, some flash enablers [[leyline of anticipation]] and some dudes with flash [[Mystic Snake]] [[bogardan hellkite]].  Intet is graced with being very open-ended.  So she has room to change from aggro to control to even combo.  Karador is just brutal once you get it optimized, but it doesn't seem like your thing.  [[Brago]] does some cool stuff, especially with [[decree of silence]] [[reality acid]] or even [[lavinia of the tenth]]  Also, don't be afraid to lose a game? Some people don't really understand that.  A game doesn't need to go on for 2 hours.  It's like being stuck in purgatory.  You should be happy to play a game, do some cool stuff and then shuffle up for a couple more.  Also, don't be afraid to have a combo or two tucked away in your deck.  Even if it's a 4 card combo.  The game does need to end at some point, and sometimes it's just needed.  Some of the best EDH stories are ones where I didn't win the game.   Hopefully you found this helpful! I wrote a bit more than I planned.  If you need me to clarify anything or answer any other questions, feel free to ask."

EDH,3dxpqg,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think I tend to play more active decks, almost of them are looking for ways to get ahead and to dodge whatever is thrown at it. If part of my current plan gets taken out, I'll look for a way to get it back on track or come up with a new one that can be put into action asap. That's not to say I don't have any reactive plays as I tend to run a fair bit of spot removal or cards that are in there to specifically deal with certain threats or strategies. My first time playing MTG outside of either the steam games or drafting/sealed was with an all in RG aggro deck in standard (3-1 and top 8 i believe out of 40~ people) and since then, that's not really changed much except that I have decks that run removal now and ways to deal with specific things. I pick a card or interaction I like and try to make a deck around it. My most recent example would be damia. I liked her ability and wanted to play around it, so my deck revolves around quickly ramping up to 7, playing her, then drawing cards and discarding whatever I don't need to refill my hand with her. It's also my first real attempt at a proper control deck. depends on the person, I enjoy my reactive damia deck quite a bit at the moment, but it's not an overall strategy I enjoy a lot. I always looking to actively get ahead, to make the plays that force my enemies to deal with or lose. for some other people, they will likely find it a lot more enjoyable than I do. (for example, one of my friends was known as ""Matt says No"" for a while for his control deck) I love sticking to a theme, my mono green deck (prior to no tuck rule) got completely 100% screwed if my general got tucked as the entire deck fell apart without her there. I'm sure the same would happen to my damia deck if she got tucked prior to the rule change as the only draw I run other than her is Kiora. I don't spine of ish sah in any decks, just don't like the card in general, although I have seen how much work it can do at times thanks to a couple of people playing it against me. Not really (unless it's karrthus), but I'd still rather avoid it. most my playgroup avoid building duplicate generals anyway, think the only copies we have at the moment at 2 people with ghave and possibly soon to be 2 people with bruna. probably a mimeo reanimator that a friend used to run or the monoblack that another one runs.

I tend to build decks around the commander first, then slowly dilute what doesn't work for covering weaknesses/answers.

Thats how my Maze's End EDH and Anus Mackenzie Banti-fun deck came around. Against my meta I'll put different cards into those decks (I.E. in Mayael I put [[Choke]], [[Spellbreaker Behemoth]], and [[Ruric Thar]] because everyone plays blue except me) Yes as long as no one (including me) is able to do anything. I am the kind of person who (if playing a reactive deck) will try to destroy lands and fog and lay down things like [[Winter Orb]] and [[Spirit of the Labrynth]] to effectively stop the game until I can combo and win. If my decks have combos to win then I make it extremely difficult to assemble to combo (i.e. 1 tutor at most for a 3-4 part combo) so I can finish but we actually get to play some EDH and other people have a chance to combo off as well.   4b. Generally no, it's a basic decklist I throw together using the cards I have then I will tweak it based on what cards I find underwhelming or if it's particularly useless when I see it then try to find and alternative that I will want to see regularly.   I used to value theme more but now I will compromise because losing every (or almost every) game is no fun so I have to be able to win a bit. No, unless they are on the same gameplan, i.e. two Riku combo decks or 2 Rafiq tron decks and such. I respect their right to play it but I find it distasteful to play the same deck as someone else unless that is your only deck.

Haven't been playing long enough to really switch, but I have started including occasional answers, but typically only in theme rather than best value. Always. That's what drew me to EDH, being able to build your deck around your commander and see what janky stuff you can pull off. (also why i dont play answers to things, it just isnt fun to me if you can never use your commander). Not at all. I opened a cryptic command in mm2, threw it in a deck as an afterthought. Wasn't very impressed, and went to trade in and was shocked to see how much it was worth.  Very much so. My monogreen elfball runs a grand total of 4 non-elf creatures. And I'm planning on taking them out. Only happened to me once, had two Omnaths, one of which I was running. It didn't really bother me, but that's probably mostly because his was so different. His was Omnath, Voltron of Mana, while I had Omnath, locus of elves. A friend of mine runs a deck very similar to this one"

EDH,3dxpqg,worldofilth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"I have a few different ways I build decks. Sometimes I find a general I really like and want to build around, sometimes I have a theme or way-to-play for a deck and have to find the right general for it, and sometimes I find a few cards that have neat synergy I try to build around.    I play both. Over the years I've gained a good eye for threats (I play with the same group mostly, so knowing ""What killed me last time"" is a big help for the future) so my decks do tend to be fairly reactive, but this also depends on the colors. A blue deck will have Cyclonic Rift, a white deck will have a lot of cheap white exile and wrath, a black deck will have wraths,a  R/B deck will have Terminate and Dreadbore, etc. I like being able to remove my threats. But my first two decks were Animar and Rakdos so I'm up on the creature thing. My Riku deck is less reactive and more ""do my thing."" Just depends on the general and plan. Oh...I guess I answered this. Started with more creature decks, these days I'm playing a lot more control. I feel like if I want to be able to play consistently well I need control, but that might not be true. I never build a deck (or haven't yet) specifically to deal with my meta. But it impacts every card choice, such as ramming Back to Nature and Creeping Corrosion and Bane of Progress into every deck that doesn't run tons of artifacts and enchantments.  It is fun, but it's a different kind of fun. I relish in the challenge. I'm a fidgety guy and it took me a while to truly learn the value of holding your cards until you need them (it's so tempting as a new player to want to play a spell every turn, always use your mana, play as many as you can etc). So not playing my spells isn't fun, but being able to control the board, be a threat, and win despite the former is a lot of fun for me. It can feel cheap winning because ""I wasn't the biggest threat"" but sometimes that's just part of the strat. 4b. I don't. I'm not going to claim to be the best deck builder because I'm not. Maybe I should. But I like powerful cards, and I like cards that affect the board in different ways. So if your card is doing a bunch of different things one of them is bound to be useful. I don't call it theme as much as I do synergy. I like synergy as it makes cheap/undervalued cards better- I mean by definition it makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. So I try to play to that. Spine of Ish Sah is just too expensive for your average deck- but a deck that Sacrifices/recurs/plays artifacts for free? Yeah I'll do that. I'm a little bothered by two people playing the same general, but more bothered if it's essentially the same deck. I have at least 3 decks I don't play often because two are the same generals people in my meta frequently play (Prossh and Daretti) and my deck doesn't do much differently (a handful of cards are different). The 3rd is Nekusar which I was really excited for before it turns out he's just the same deck every time. I'm happy to play against one but I don't think I get anything special out of playing him. I have about 3 decks that are hard control. Tasigur and Zedruu just sort of ended up there because I play control until I have the General and spare mana to activate their abilties. The 3rd is something I consider truly special- 5-Color Play Your Spells.   Here's the deck if you're curious  Other than that I have an opponent who plays Mono Blue Talrand so he plays your average control. Guile is really cool in that deck."
EDH,3dxpqg,ProtoJMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"Do you play active or reactive decks ? Do you try to reach a middle ground?    I like to play active decks; working towards succeeding at my own gameplan has always been more fun for me than preventing others from getting to play theirs. That said, I always make sure to include a good amount of spot removal, because someone needs to have it when one player prepares to take me or the entire table out, and it might as well be me - saving the table earns you political points as well.   Have you changed from one approach to another over the years?   I didn't use to run as many answers, but playing in the meta at my LGS has taught me that you need to have the capacity to deal with the competitive players when the casual players at your table are unprepared to do so.    When you start building a deck, do you build around a card/theme, or against your current meta ? Do you try to squeeze in both?   I always build around a theme, it's much more fun to build around a deck you want to play, as opposed to one that just intends to survive.   Is a control/reactive deck inherently fun to play in EDH for you?   No.   Do you value theme over covering your deck's natural weaknesses? If so, would you compromise by inserting a Spine of Ish Sah whenever your deck just can't answer some things?   I generally try to stick to a theme, but see 2.   Are you in any way bothered by two people playing the same general in the same game?   No, though I personally won't pull out a deck if someone is playing the same commander.   What's the best control-ish deck you've seen or built in EDH until now?   Either mono-blue 30+ counterspells, or the Zegana deck in my meta that's nothing but counterspells, bounce, and value ETB cards."
EDH,3dxpqg,Freakjob003,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"Active. I pack a lot of answers, don't get me wrong, but this is a multiplayer format. Cards need to be played and gameplans need to be brought to fruition. I believe heavily reactive decks often get left in the dust because it's difficult to control a whole table of players. A little. I find myself cutting Counterspells often, along with removal that sits on the table (royal assassin style cards). I think this is due to the philosophy I have about control in commander. It really depends. I always have a theme/set of cards I want to play in mind. I also build around commanders that synergize with the deck. Vorel, Daxos, Shattergang, Selvala are all examples of this. Crosis was an attempt to embody my control philosophy and Surrak took a lot of work. Surrak was built because I absolutely loves his story in Khans and I wanted a wedge color deck. Took forever to make a theme I was satisfied with. Nope. I don't like lock downs, combos, or playing my opponents game. I also don't think it's a very good strategy in commander. Your friends will catch on and they will single you out. Instead, I durdle hard in the beginning, protect myself in the mid game, and when everyone exhausts their resources, I strike with a full hand. Control in commander is a whole different beast. It's not about 1 for 1 removal, and Counterspells need to be played as protection or ways to stop game winning spells. I have a firm belief that you should rarely use counters on permanents in a multiplayer game unless it will win them the game on the spot or generate way too much value to come back from. This results in a lower ""reactive card"" slot in commander. Mix the two. My Vorel deck can answer almost everything and the whole removal package is flavorful. If this isn't a possibility, just make sure your theme is so strong that who cares if you drop something a little off. No. Although, I dig variety so id probably switch if someone pulled out the same commander as me. Others can do as they please. I'm proud of my Daxos and Crosis decks. They were the best in my play group. However, Someone in my group just made Tasigur lands/combo/lockdown. I'm assuming his will do great, until we all gang up on him."
EDH,3dxpqg,Call911FTW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Do you play active or reactive decks ? Do you try to reach a middle ground ?    Depends on my deck. Melek is pillowfort until I explode on your face. Nekusar is active, but sneaky about it (lay the groundwork... then wheels and wheels to wipe the table in one turn). Oloro is very reactive, just trying to stay alive long enough to cheese out a lame win with [[Test of Endurance]] and cards like that. Riku is the most middle of the ground I've got. Basically, he just drops good stuff, copies it, and slows people down with some control.   When you start building a deck, do you build around a card/theme, or against your current meta ? Do you try to squeeze in both ?   Theme dictates commander. Commander dictates the way I build the deck. There are certain sub-themes I always run. I'm running at least 3 pieces of graveyard hate in every deck. You like to search your libraries? Ha! I don't think you'll find a deck of mine lacking [[Mindlock Orb]], [[Stranglehold]], [[Aven Mindcensor]], and/or Obnixos Unshackled. Further, creatures are not my thing. I have like 6 decks and 4 of them have less than 5 creatures in them.    Do you value theme over covering your deck's natural weaknesses ?   Bad question. Every style has an inherent weakness, but taking care of that weakness just means trading off somewhere else.    Are you in any way bothered by two people playing the same general in the same game ?   For the most part, yes. i won't not play, but I will urge the players to not do that. It creates two problems: global effects will tend to synergy well with the other's deck creating two really strong decks. Second, its lame. You play Krenko? He plays Krenko? We all play Krenko!!!!"

EDH,3dxpqg,Findlesham,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"Both, though I lean towards control (reactive) with the decks I plan to be the most powerful.   I had my earliest tournament success (non-EDH, this was 1996 or so) with red/green and mono-red Sligh.  Once I moved into multiplayer (still pre-EDH), I realized that the key to winning was either to be the last player with any resources (control) or to explode and take out the table all at once (combo).  These preferences continued to EDH.   I build my decks mostly around the Commander (card) or the mechanical gameplan or Vorthosian theme that inspired me.  However, when designing a deck to be powerful, I do use a few card slots to keep in mind the most common decks in my area.   For example, I tend to pack a few ways to kill Kaalia, Brago, and Zurgo, Helmsmasher as those are three top decks my friends have that all rely on their commander.   No.  Winning is inherently fun.  Time with my friends is inherently fun.  The act of piloting some control decks is fun.  The act of playing some decks is inherently un-fun.  I don't enjoy playing judgebreaker decks, Winter Orb decks, or combos which soft- or hard-lock people out of game actions.     4b.  I don't include a mandatory percentage of cards of a type in all control decks.  I would note that control decks can be pretty much any color or combination of colors.  Sun Quan's Regimented Blue is an aggro deck with cards in units of 4:  it has 8 countermagic spells and 8 card drawing spells and 8 removal spells, 8 being 12.5% of the 64 total spells and roughly 8% of the 99 overall cards in the draw deck.  The N.W.O. is a control deck without blue in it, but with 16 board wipes and other mechanical card packages (ramp, targeted removal, bombs, card drawing).     Even in my most stringent theme decks, such as Garza Zol's Bad Girls, I make exceptions.  In this case, the only cards in the deck without women in the art are mana rocks.   Is the general one of the handful of S-tier all-star generals which lends itself to a single, linear deck and which I do not enjoy playing against?  Two Nekusar or two Krenko, for example, could get unfun pretty quickly, but two Phelddagrif or two Karona, False God could be anything.  Two Sliver players equals trouble when they take out the table and declare a Hive Victory.   My N.W.O. is my go-to win-a-game-to-show-I-can deck.  It is very good at not losing and plays a few, extremely resilient threats.  My Bling deck is both more flavorful and mechanically-uncommon as it packs its repeatable boardwipe in the form of an exploding baby."

EDH,3dxpqg,thereddithunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:59 2015 UTC,"I'd have to define it as active, but it can definitely respond to and interact with whatever my opponents are doing. Vorel relies on assembling multiple pieces to win, even when its just beating face with a couple fatties, and because of this is very disruptable. Because he telegraphs his intentions more than I'd like, I have to run counters for protection, and plenty of removal to slow down my opponents till Vorel can do his thing. Reactive elements are absolutely vital to this deck, and it probably would never win a game without them. My first deck was Xenagos, which turned into Riku. so i definitely started out hard aggro. Over the years I've built more decks like Ink-treader and Melek, which definitely play reactive while waiting for the perfect moment. but I still have Aurelia and Vorel, so I wouldn't say I've changed, but I've matured. My aggro decks are now more balanced, and I've grown to appreciate playing the longer game from time to time. I always start with the commander and build from there, sometimes with a theme in mind. If I want to try a similar interaction or style but don't like the commander, I change it. I don't think I know how to play hard control, but playing reactively definitely can be, If i like the style of the deck, like i do with Melek. I keep a balance between removal and permission, in all my decks, because they're useful for different threats and in different situations.  Again, kinda both. It's a constant struggle in Vorel whenever I have to cut a simic-feeling card for something like Tezzeret. but i think I've reached a pretty good balance with theme at the front. Nope. although I guess I think variety is always more fun and interesting, I frequently play against both of my friends wanderer decks at the same time (those are some rough games). It's interesting, because they both build and play the deck very differently. Oh, man. a fully tuned Azami deck. that thing was stupid good."

EDH,3e1apm,edhrec,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:26 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've tried to build my own EDH deck. After getting thoroughly ruined this past weekend with a retail deck and some friends, I decided to put together my own with something that might beat them. One has a dragon deck filled with big nasties, one has an Eldrazi deck with heavy mana ramp and Omanth, and the last guy was switching between a blue control deck and a goblin horde deck (at one point, he had 120 2/2 goblins). This is my attempt to be useful with what I have plus a few extra I bought. Basic premise is mana ramp Voltron with versatility. I don't know if I have enough to necessarily win every game against them, but I think this deck is actually useful to my teammate in two headed giant."
EDH,3e1apm,jadpk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:16 2015 UTC,I'm not super familiar with voltron decks but 25 creatures sounds like a lot when only one will matter. Maybe it is just me though.
EDH,3e1apm,Ravenholt79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:05 2015 UTC,"Panorama's are really bad.  Temple of the false god is bad as well.  There are many cheap duals you can get. The Temples are cheap to buy, City of Brass and Mana Confluence are great.  You want to fix that mana base first IMO.  Uril is all about racing for the win and Panoramas essensially set you back a turn.   Enchants: Get Unquestionned Authority, Battle Mastery, Daybreak Coronet and Totem Armors!  You have way too many creatures... I would cut at least half.   Here's my list:  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/uril-enchanted-im-sure/  I win a lot of 1v1 with it lol.  Be aware though that Voltron isn't really great in Free for All multiplayer.  You will often kill a player and get run over right after.  But as I stated, in 1v1 Uril is great."
EDH,3e1apm,Ravenholt79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"On the creatures, a lot of them are enchantment creatures so they are a bit more versatile. The others are creatures that either buff playing enchantments (draw card if enchantment is played, all enchantments are totem armor, etc) or provide some other buff (can't discard or sac a card, can't be countered, etc). Which of these would you cut? I'll certainly work on the mana. A lot of that is because it is what I have on hand. I'm cheap like that.  We don't normally play free for all multiplayer. Normally it is either two headed giant or 1v1."
EDH,3e1apm,Ravenholt79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"From having tried many variances of the Enchantress build (Draw cards when you play enchantments) I can say that it's more durdly if you overdo it.  You should be able to ramp hard, cast Uril and then win with at most 2 enchantments. Usually go for evasion (flying or trample depending), and then something that give double strike. Your enchants should cost 1 to 3 mana unless it's a card like Runes of the Deus.   I would cut Thrashing Mossdog, Skylasher, Silent Sentinel, Setessan Battle Priest, Meglonoth, Griffin Dreamfinder, Fabled Hero, Chronicler of Heroes, Chorus of the Conclave and Ajani's Chosen.   I'd remove most of the bestow enchantment creatures as well. If an Aura is not giving you any kind of evasion, then it's simply not worth playing. Bsetow costs are really high and really slow down the deck.  You can get a lot of mileage out of Rancor and if you check out my list, you'll have a good idea of what the optimal aura's are.   Not a fan of Caged Sun in 3 colors, I don't think it's worth it. Ring of Three Wishes is very slow. You also have a lot of reach which I assume is there because your meta has a lot of big flying beaters? If not, then you're better off concentrating on generating a bigger, faster Uril.   You need more answers, you can't go wrong with following staples: Heliod's Pilgrim, Eternal Witness, Swords to Plowshares, Path to Exile, Idylic Tutor, Enlightenned Tutor. The 3 signets, Boros Charm (Surprise double strike, very versatile), Nature's Lore (only if you run the shock lands). oh and Darksteel Mutation.  Also, if you have the funding, Sylvan Library and Sensei's Divining Top.  I know you built the deck with what was available to you (I do that too) but like most Voltron decks,  you want to keep it slim and simple."
EDH,3e1apm,bcfox1865,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"I do play against a lot of flying, be it Eldrazi, Dragons, or Angels as I mentioned in a different reply. With that in mind, do you still think I should pull my reach/flyers. I will look into the other cards you mentioned. Some of them are still on my aquire list."
EDH,3e1apm,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"I think you should still pull them.  Aura's that give you flying are good enough and boost Uril at the same time.  Those reach slots are better dedicated to either voltron auras OR answers. With Uril you want to be first, often you want to finish games before anyone has a chance to respond.  Your only concern is wraths and counterspells. In theory, you should be able to establish a bigger and meaner presence before anyone else can.   A good start would be:  T1: Forest, Sol Ring  T2: Basic Land, Kodama's Reach  T3: (we now have 5 mana) Land drop, play Uril (hope he doesn't die)  T4: Drop 2 auras on Uril, Battle Mastery + Shield of the Oversoul, Swing for 22.  Make friends sad.   Of course you can't always get that sort of hand, but that's the gameplan you want. If you anticipate wraths, then Totem is better than double strike.   It's all about red zoning with Uril.  Give other players too many turns and you're in trouble.  A good plan B is Sigarda if you can't get Uril to stick.  If you start drawing creatures with reach instead of needed auras or even draw, the game is now stalling and  you're top decking in hopes that you get fuel for Uril ."

EDH,3dzz7m,Sting3r,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"Heyo, here's some advice for your deck.  Lands:   It's really good that you've decided to run 38 lands. You are 3 colours and I see lots of people running less just because they have Green in their deck. I'd suggest not using the bounce lands and use the Temples from Theros instead.    Sorceries:   With your curve sitting around 4, I'd probably run some way to get more lands. Some ways to just find lands that aren't basic since you run more nonbasics than basics. Crop Rotation has too small an effect. [[Expedition Map]] might be a good addition, but its effect is very small.   Instants:   Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile might be some good spot removal against some problem creatures. Board wipes are high cost and Sorcery speed, so they're not good in a tight spot.   Artifacts:   [[Commander's Sphere]] is better than Obelisk of Bant. Run all three of your signets.  Caged Sun is not good with three colours. [[Mirari's Wake]] might be better if you want this kind of effect.   Enchantments:   Righteous Authority is an enchantment that kind of feels a bit out of place here. You could run a symmetrical effect of drawing cards just to make it a bit friendlier to people and lower your curve...or use something like [[Curiosity]]. I see you mentioned that you wanted each card to be angel-centric, but you run Sigil of the Empty Throne and have only 10 enchantments. This card might be better to cut since it's 5 mana and won't get you a lot of tokens.   Creatures:   I think with how high cost your creatures are, I think Twilight Shepard might have too little an effect."

EDH,3dzz7m,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!   The thing that appealed to me about bounce lands is the ability to have all three colors from just two cards. [[Temple of Mystery]], for example, can get me U or G, but I can't cast Jenara with that and 1 Plains. I can get that with Simic Growth Chamber. Maybe the math doesn't check out, but it feels like it's working. Maybe that's perception error. I'll look into other land-fetching effects. Definitely favoring the spot removal currently. Have to find something to cut for that. Commander's Sphere doesn't look as pretty, but that's a good idea :P Not sure why I forgot the third signet originally. I've been seeing Mirari's Wake appear in a few other decklists. I think I do like that better, and I may have actually been misinterpreting Caged Sun to begin with. Righteous Authority likely shouldn't be here. At the time, it was a card I was trying to find a place for and I think I was just shoving it into everything I made. The card draw is appealing, but there are other effects for that. Sigil of the Empty Throne looks so cool. The fact that it makes angels is 9/10ths of why I like this card. But there isn't a lot of support for it, you're right. Will be a shame to cut that. Twilight Shepherd is more board wipe-security than anything else. I'd rather have those cards return to my hand than go to the graveyard, because even if they cost a lot, I don't have many ways to get them back out once they're there. Could save an Iona for me, after all."

I don't have every single infinite combo possible in it, but I have some, like Kiki-Jiki and Valorous Conscripts/pestermite or Mikaeus + Murderous Redcap.   The key is to have lots of sac outlets, lots of ways to lose your own life to control dethrone, and of course have some etb creatures and ways to steal creatures. I don't run a ton of steal creature stuff but it's mainly just because I simply don't have room  for it all.

EDH,3e1vyu,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jul 21 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"Marchesa is an interesting commander. Her ability is really fun, and makes it a lot harder for people to successfully boardwipe you because of the fact that her ability is a delayed trigger, meaning even if she dies to a boardwipe if all your other creatures had at least 1 counter on them, they're coming back. Any cards/creatures that naturally involve +1/+1 counters are obviously really good in this deck. Things like [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]], [[Unspeakable Symbol]], [[Curse of Stalked Prey]], etc. Undying creatures are nice because they'll come back no matter what if Marchesa's out, so long as they don't get exiled. If you have a reliable sac outlet-which you should have a few of in a Marchesa deck-[[Flayer of the Hatebound]] makes it incredibly easy to burn people and their creatures. Undying creatures in general are really good in Marchesa decks, as well as Unleash creatures like [[Exava, Rakdos Blood Witch]] and [[Carnival Hellsteed]]. [[Sage of Fables]] is another really good card to have in this deck because she makes it so Marchesa will always enter the battlefield with a counter, as well as allowing you to get draws if you can afford to remove counters. Sac outlets are really important in a Marchesa deck because you'll almost always end up with the advantage because you're not really trading anything. Things like [[Attrition]], [[Phyrexian Altar]], [[Ashnod's Altar]], etc. [[Reef Worm]] can actually get hilarious in this deck. Don't be afraid to include boardwipes of your own either, because again delayed trigger. You don't even have to return Marchesa to the command zone because her ability can bring herself back.   Ok, so that's all individual card advice, but now I'll move on to how you can win. If you have a sac outlet that doesn't cost any mana to activate (like Ashnod) [[Murderous Redcap]]+Mikeaus is infinite damage. There's always the classic blue and red token infinite of Kiki-Jiki and Pestermite. Obviously those are combo wins, but if your playgroup isn't into infinites you can always just beat people up with creatures."

[[Terastodon]] is pretty great for multiplayer.  Also I know that [[Solemn Simulacrum]] is good, but in mono-green you could be getting 2 lands. Or you could get any land with [[Crop Rotation]].   Other than that I think you could run more non basic lands ie. [[Tranquil Thicket]], [[Arcane lighthouse]], [[Buried Ruin]], [[Myriad Landscape]], maybe even [[Haunted Fengraf]], [[Rushwood Grove]]."

EDH,3dxfri,Tangerinefox,2,Mon Jul 20 11:21:08 2015 UTC,"Solemn in a mono green is honestly laughable. I'm not trying to be facetious but mono green had hands down the best ramping capabilities, needing to keep a slot for a four drop that gets a basic tapped and draws on death isn't optimal. Although this isn't to say solemn is in anyway a bad card ever"
EDH,3dxfri,PapBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"Playing so many basics because of Vernal Bloom and Gaea's Touch. I don't disagree that K.Reach and Skyshroud belong. I literally just built this yesterday so I'm going to play it a bit to figure out what I'm swapping. And for some reason I've never like Terastodon, idk really why."

EDH,3dxfri,KaoticShadow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:55 2015 UTC,I don't think you need 44 lands if you're running that much spell-based ramp. You can probably cut some of the basics for more meat.

EDH,3dxfri,OldMetalShip,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:59 2015 UTC,Seriously.  Craterhoof Behemoth and Tooth is horribly boring.
EDH,3e0y0y,Gr33n-NiTr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"It's good to look at the commanders that come in the precon decks. 2013 commander precons were tricolor. The bant one (WUG) has Derevi as the commander. Shes OP in 1v1. The packs come with 2 alternative commanders though. It's worth looking at those commanders to see if it's interesting. The decks aren't expensive but they're meh out of the box. My friend and I each bought a deck. He got ""Evasive Maneuvers"" with Derevi and I got ""Mind Seize"" with Jeleva. We have kept almost none of the original deck and replaced them with singles because we wanted to make them good. Up to how seriously you wanf to play."
EDH,3e0y0y,cstracq2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"Continuing on your precon note, the mono white one would have good cards for kemba (since it had an equipment and token-y subtheme).  Unfortunately a lot of the good equipment is expensive, but some good budget ones include [[sword of vengeance]], [[loxodon warhammer]], [[strata scythe]] (in mono-white). [[Relic seeker]] and [[stonehewer giant]] are also good for finding your best equipment cards."

EDH,3e0y0y,TheGorefiend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"I think I paid $20-25 for my 2013 deck. But I've since dumped a lot more money into it. If you will play commander against someone else with a precon deck, you should both be fairly even (granted you don't get the OP ones or ones with commanders that are banned in 1v1) and you won't have to spend the extra money to edit the deck"
EDH,3e0y0y,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"Kemba is one of my favourite commanders for a budget deck. You don't really need to go all out on the Swords and whatnot, you can use just about any piece of Equipment.  [[Mentor of the Meek]], [[Avarice Amulet]] and [[Skullclamp]] (~$3 right now) are some ways that work with Kemba to draw you cards. [[Staff of Nin]] is also a nice inclusion for a mono-white deck.  For win conditions, you've got things like [[Jazal Goldmane]], [[Dragon Throne of Tarkir]], or even [[Grafted Exoskeleton]].  [[Konda's Banner]], [[Ajani Goldmane]], [[Raksha Golden Cub]], and [[Godsend]] are a few cards that I absolutely love with Kemba, but they're a little bit more expensive."
EDH,3e0uxn,midlorollin,4,Tue Jul 21 02:24:35 2015 UTC,No.  Commander damage is combat damage only.  Also you would need to deal 21 commander damage to each person to knock them out.

EDH,3e0uxn,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jul 21 06:17:53 2015 UTC,Commander damage only qualifies under combat damage from the commander. The ability he has that deals damage is only ability damage.
EDH,3e0uxn,dsblink182,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:10 2015 UTC,To be fair multiple wheels is very easy to do and gets the job done. Its very easy to wheel into another wheel and so on. You may not be able to do it all in one turn but you can significantly damage all your opponents at once or play political and use it as a finisher..
EDH,3e0uxn,MinervaMedica000,0,Tue Jul 21 06:08:16 2015 UTC,"True which is why I play a nek deck, he's Sooooooo stupid. He deals far too much damage just because he wants to lol."

It could also help in creature-based strategies to dig for bombs (i.e. you sacrifice a bunch of creatures to [[Viscera Seer]] with this on the table in order to dig for [[Living Death]] or similar).  I don't think the activated ability has much going for it, unless you're making much much more mana than you can reasonably spend."

EDH,3dxund,SharkFinnigan,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"It's not amazing but it has some usefulness. It depends on several factors:   does the deck have bad draws or lack card draw are you limiting tutors in your deck do you have ways to sacrifice and recur the same creature (bloodghast, reassembling skeleton, gravecrawler, etc.) do you have enchantment synergy do you need a mana dump   If the majority are yes, then run this card. Other cards do similar but not both and this is cheap enough and not broken enough to stay under the radar."
EDH,3dxund,Jadien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:01 2015 UTC,If you want this kind of effect you probably want [[Bloodchief Ascension]] or [[Palace Siege]] instead

EDH,3dyb6u,ogresavant,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:04 2015 UTC,Here are some thoughts from me.   [[Yawgmoth's Bargain]] is banned in Commander.   [[Null Profusion]] seems less good than that [[Phyrexian Arena]] unless there is a combo for it I'm missing.    [[Blood Artist]] is good when creatures are dying and is a kill with Melira + Sac Outlet + Persist creature.   [[Jarad Golgari Lichlord]] and [[Lord of Extinction]] normally ends the game. You can also try to set up the combo with [[Phyrexian Devourer]].   [[Necrotic Ooze]] and [[Body Double]] could be sweet.   [[Quilspike]] and [[Devoted Druid]] makes infinite green mana but by themselves they are not great.   I think having [[Dig Through Time]] to help sculpt your graveyard and dig for answers/combo pieces is a good idea.   [[Buried Alive]] can set up Tasigur's ability and can make you Living Death insane. Also nice to have at least one reanimate effect like [[Reanimate]] or [[Dread Return]].   [[Phyrexian Metalmorph]] and [[Cyclonic Rift]] are both just great value spells.   Finally its probably going too deep but if you make infinite mana you can use Tasigur to recur as many things you need to be able to storm off and [[Tendril of Agony]] a table.

EDH,3dy1fg,CrazyEddie30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,Yeah she's a great card late game when you have all the answers to potential counter-play but T3 she only sets you back. But her ob-nixilis unshackled and a grave pact is a silly combo and hurts everyone but you. She also synergizes with mikus unhallowed really well. Just be prepared to see a lot of hate early game.
EDH,3dy1fg,RageBoner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Lol I can see that, yea I've got the Butcher of Malakir and Dictate of Erebos to play that, I may have to hit Amazon up for Ob and keep him side boarded for the Timmys out there, because that could be super fun, lol."
EDH,3dy1fg,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:46 2015 UTC,Well good luck with your deck. I will post my list when I get home.
EDH,3dy1fg,SpyglassSuperior,2,Mon Jul 20 17:50:43 2015 UTC,I think you need someway to protect Maralen like [[Lightning Greaves]] or [[Swiftfoot Boots]]. With no way to protect her the person after you can just tutor up a [[Murder]] and the fun's over.

EDH,3dy1fg,RageBoner,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard Maralen decks are unpleasant, generally-- what makes this one fun?"
EDH,3dy1fg,Puzzlemancer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"Well I've got the Sanguine Bond Exquisite Blood win con, and then Grave Pact Dictate of Erabos, with Butcher of Malakir, and the black sac ability which is the fun part for me. No real way to deal with a fast burn deck, or some other non creature dependant deck, but that's fine.   I just forsee myself enjoying this deck, and like I said I think there's one or more card that could fit the ""theme"" of the deck, cause for me, theme is one of the more important bits, lol"
EDH,3dy1fg,MTGCardFetcher,2,Mon Jul 20 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"In the interest of full disclosure, then, that probably means this is one of the unpleasant Maralen decks, if you're going to tutor out a 2-piece combo or something that means everyone else can't play their game.  I'm not saying you can't make this deck, but the title is a bit disingenuous: describing a deck as 'fun' on here tends to refer to casual builds designed to create wild board states and interactions-- not lockouts or well-known combo wins.  Be prepared to be able to play the deck exactly one time, as the next time you play it, your opponents will just take turns tutoring up removal and the game will carry on without Maralen."
EDH,3dy1fg,edhrec,2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:05 2015 UTC,"In the interest of full disclosure, then, that probably means this is one of the unpleasant Maralen decks, if you're going to tutor out a 2-piece combo or something that means everyone else can't play their game.   His 2 card combo takes 3/4 turns to tutor out and gets disrupted by any form of bounce, creature kill, enchantment destruction, counterspell, etc... Meanwhile everyone else in the game gets to grab the perfect card from their deck to stop him.   If anything his deck is underpowered. He has 0 ways to protect Maralen, the person after him can just tutor for a Murder or something and kill it every time. Honestly I think it would be much more likely that someone else uses Maralen to tutor for their own combo before him.  The brutal Maralen decks are the ones that Ad Nauseam their entire deck on one of the first few turns and then kill you with Sickening Dreams or Tendrils of Agony or Exsangunate. Something like this decklist."
EDH,3dy1fg,bulldog0256,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"The combo is there if I can't get out ahead, or if I'm playing with the one or two of my friends that tend to take it more serious. I'm thinking of sideboarding those two and only pulling them out for the one friend I can think of specifically."
EDH,3dy1fg,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"The problem I have found with Maralen is, you play her then everyone else gets to benefit from the tutor before you and if the other players are smart, at least one of them will fetch removal to kill her before you get to tutor, on the assumption your deck is better equipped to abuse the tutor. In all the games I've played against her, I think I've seen her controller actually tutor with her maybe 1 in 10 times she was cast. So her play seems to end up very binary, if your opponents know what they are doing and you accomplish nothing during the game or they don't and you landslide crush them with a two card combo or an Ad Nauseam Tendrils combo. She's sorta balanced by the fact she's a complete glass cannon if you are relying on the tutor,  All that said, as for cards you are missing for the deck, you don't have [[Ob Nixilis, Unshackled]] which seems like a no brainer. Things I believe would also greatly improve the deck, [[Heroes downfall]], [[Ashes to Ashes]], [[Solemn Simulacrum]], [[Sol Ring]], [[mana vault]], [[Cabal Coffers]] and [[ Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth]], [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]], [[Buried Alive]] or [[Entomb]], [[damnation]], [[It that Betrays]], [[Reanimate]], [[Helm of Possession]], [[Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx]], [[Phyrexian Tower]], [[Ancient Tomb]], and [[Volrath's Stronghold]].  You are running a lot of sac but not that many ways to get your dudes back once they have died and the methods you do have are mostly one shot effects, I recommend adding [[Phyrexian Reclamation]], [[Sheoldred, Whispering One]], [[Sword of Light and Shadow]], [[Profane Command]], and [[Yawgmoth's Will]].  All of that that said it looks like this deck was very much built on a budget, and if you are playing in a playgroup with similar budgets I can understand not wanting to make the majority of the changes I have recommended as some of them can be quite expensive. Take what I have said with a grain of salt though, my playgroup is incredibly cutthroat, your Maralen looks like one of the less powerful, ""fairer"" versions of the deck I have come across, even with the two card kill combo. But if you would like further advice on what you should cut for any of these cards, let me know."

Not so much in strategy (although they all are VERY different in that regard), but in appearance and flavor.   Vorel, my main man, weird mutant that does mutant things. Feels like a cool main character, thus my maindeck.  Daxos, a hero, I imagine him to be a Robin Hood style character, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Also my only generic fantasy hero commander.  Shattergang, a squad of goblin tinkerers, mischievous, and a group instead of one specific character.  Crosis. I had to get a badass dragon. It is elder dragon highlander after all. Very different than my previous decks.  Selvala. Before conspiracy dropped I prayed to the mtg gods ""bring me a badass gal (didn't have a female commander! It felt uneven) an make her GW (second favorite color combo, not represented yet in my decks), and give her a strange ability that I can tool around with in a way no one else will."" All of my prayers were answered. I flipped when she was released.   Surrak, he's a giant man. I giant man that punches bears.   I'm super specific with my commanders. They're a pantheon. I don't double dip into blocks, and I love making them into a mismatched RPG party. Im weird"

EDH,3dwz1x,iserane,2,Mon Jul 20 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"I do think Holistic Wisdom is the strongest of the ones mentioned, it basically always lets you get what you want.  I love it in Sidisi, but my Tasigur is much more control oriented (only runs 3 creatures I think). The non-recursion (as it exiles itself) is a major turn-off for me, and I feel like I have enough cards already that do what it does better (like Witness), I'd probably put in Den Protector before I would Nyx. The mill is nice, but I definitely have enough of it through other means. You have less ways to get stuff in the yard (Troll, Loam, Dakra, FoF, Sultai Charm), so the added utility of it would probably be worth it in your deck."
